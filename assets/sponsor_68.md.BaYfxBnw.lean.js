It lived about 74.5-66 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous of North America. The name means \\"separated lizard\\" (referring to the arrangement of the cheek bones in an incomplete type skull), but is often mistranslated as \\"noble lizard\\" in reference to the presumed \\"Roman nose\\" (in the original specimen, the nasal region was fragmented and disarticulated, and was originally restored flat). History of discovery Barnum Brown's initial flatheaded reconstruction of the skull of K. navajovius, 1910 In 1904, Barnum Brown discovered the type specimen (AMNH 5799) of Kritosaurus near the Ojo Alamo Formation, San Juan County, New Mexico, United States, while following up on a previous expedition. He initially could not definitely correlate the stratigraphy, but by 1916 was able to establish it as from what is now known as the late Campanian-age De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation. When discovered, much of the front of the skull had either eroded or fragmented, and Brown reconstructed this portion after what is now called Edmontosaurus, leaving out many fragments. However, he had noticed that something was different about the fragments, but ascribed the differences to crushing. He initially wanted to name it Nectosaurus, but found out that this name was already in use; Jan Versluys, who had visited Brown before the change, inadvertently leaked the previous choice. He kept the specific name, though, leading to the combination K. navajovius. The 1914 publication of the arch- snouted Canadian genus Gryposaurus changed Brown's mind about the anatomy of his dinosaur's snout. Going back through the fragments, he revised the previous reconstruction and gave it a Gryposaurus-like arched nasal crest. He also synonymized Gryposaurus with Kritosaurus, a move supported by Charles Gilmore. This synonymy was used through the 1920s (William Parks's designation of a Canadian species as Kritosaurus incurvimanus, now considered a synonym of Gryposaurus notabilis) and became standard after the publication of Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright's 1942 monograph on North American hadrosaurids. From this time until 1990, Kritosaurus would be composed of at least the type species K. navajovius, K. incurvimanus, and K. notabilis, the former type species of Gryposaurus. The poorly known species Hadrosaurus breviceps (Marsh, 1889), known from a dentary from the Campanian-age Judith River Formation of Montana, was also assigned to Kritosaurus by Lull and Wright, but this is no longer accepted. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hadrosaurus had entered the discussion as a possible synonym of either Kritosaurus, Gryposaurus, or both, particularly in semi-technical \\"dinosaur dictionaries\\". David B. Norman's The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs, uses Kritosaurus for the Canadian material (Gryposaurus), but identifies the mounted skeleton of K. incurvimanus as Hadrosaurus. The synonymization of Kritosaurus and Gryposaurus that lasted from the 1910s to 1990 led to a distorted picture of what the original Kritosaurus material represented. Because the Canadian material was much more complete, most representations and discussions of Kritosaurus from the 1920s to 1990 are actually more applicable to Gryposaurus. This includes, for example, James Hopson's discussion of hadrosaur cranial ornamentation, and the adaptation of this for the public in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. =Formerly assigned species and material= In 1984, Argentine paleontologist Jos√© Bonaparte and colleagues named Kritosaurus australis for hadrosaur bones from the late Campanian-early Maastrichtian Los Alamitos Formation of Rio Negro, Patagonia, Argentina. This species is now thought to be a synonym of Secernosaurus koerneri. In 1990, Jack Horner and David B. Weishampel once again separated Gryposaurus, citing the uncertainty associated with the latter's partial skull. Horner in 1992 described two more skulls from New Mexico that he claimed belonged to Kritosaurus and showed that it was quite different from Gryposaurus, but the following year Adrian Hunt and Spencer G. Lucas put each skull in its own genus, creating Anasazisaurus and Naashoibitosaurus. Adrian Hunt and Spencer G. Lucas, American paleontologists, named Anasazisaurus horneri in 1993. The name was derived from the Anasazi, an ancient Native American people, and the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"). The Anasazi were famous for their cliff-dwellings, such as those in Chaco Canyon, near the location of fossil Anasazisaurus remains. The term \\"Anasazi\\" itself is actually a Navajo language word, anaas√°z√≠ (\\"enemy ancestors\\"). The species was named in honor of Jack Horner, the American paleontologist who first described the skull in 1992. The holotype skull (and only known specimen) was collected in the late 1970s by a Brigham Young University field party working in San Juan County, and is housed at BYU as BYU 12950. Unnamed specimen from the Sabinas Basin in Mexico, assigned to Kritosaurus sp. by Kirkland et al. (2006) but considered an indeterminate saurolophine by Prieto-M√°rquez (2013). Horner originally assigned the Anasazisaurus skull to Kritosaurus navajovius, but Hunt and Lucas could not find any diagnostic features in the limited material of Kritosaurus and judged the genus to be a nomen dubium. Since the Anasazisaurus skull did have diagnostic features of its own, and did not appear to them to share any unique features with Kritosaurus, it was given the new name Anasazisaurus horneri, an opinion which was supported by some later authors. Not all authors have agreed with this, Thomas E. Williamson in particular defending Horner's original interpretation, and several subsequent studies recognized both distinct genera. A comprehensive study of known Kritosaurus material published by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez in 2013 upheld the status of Naashoibitosaurus as a distinct genus, but found that the type specimens of Kritosaurus and Anasazisaurus were indistinguishable when comparing overlapping elements (i.e. only those bones preserved in both specimens). Prieto-M√°rquez therefore regarded Anasazisaurus as a synonym of Kritosaurus, but retained it as the distinct species K. horneri. A partial skeleton from the Sabinas Basin in Mexico was described as Kritosaurus sp. by Jim Kirkland and colleagues, but considered an indeterminate saurolophine by Prieto-M√°rquez (2013). This skeleton is about 20% larger than other known specimens, around 11 meters [36 ft] long, and with a distinctively curved ischium, and represents the largest known well-documented North American saurolophine. Unfortunately, the nasal bones are also incomplete in the skull remains from this material. Description Size comparison The type specimen of Kritosaurus navajovius is only represented by a partial skull and lower jaws, and associated postcranial remains. The greater portion of the muzzle and upper beak are missing. The length of the skull is estimated at 87 centimeters (34 in) from the tip of the upper beak to the base of the quadrate that articulates with the lower jaw at the back of the skull. Potential diagnostic characteristics of Kritosaurus include a predentary (lower beak) without tooth-like crenulations, a sharp downward bend to the lower jaws near the beak, and a heavy, somewhat rectangular maxilla (upper tooth-bearing bone). Based on the skull originally referred to Anasazisaurus, the form of the complete crest is that of a tab or flange of bone, from the nasals, that rises between and above the eyes and folds back under itself. This unique crest allows it to be distinguished from similar hadrosaurs, like Gryposaurus. The top of the crest is roughened, and the maximum preserved length of the skull is ~90 centimeters (~35 in). K. navajovius life restoration According to Prieto-M√°rquez who re-diagnosed this genus in 2013, Kritosaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the length of the dorsolateral margin of the maxilla is extensive, the jugal features an orbital constriction that is deeper than the infratemporal one, the infratemporal fenestra is greater than the orbit and has a dorsal margin that is greatly elevated above the dorsal orbital margin in adults, the frontal bone is participating in the orbital margin, the presence of paired caudal parasagittal processes of the nasals resting over the frontal bones. In 2016, Paul estimated its length at 9 meters (30 feet) and its weight at 4 tonnes (4.4 short tons).Paul, G.S., 2016, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, second edition, Princeton University Press p. 340 Holtz (2011) gives the same length.https://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/dinoappendix/HoltzappendixWinter2011.pdf Classification Kritosaurus was a hadrosaurine hadrosaurid, a flat-headed or solid-crested duckbill. Though many species and specimens have been referred to the genus in the past, most of them do not show the shared distinguishing characteristics to allow them to be considered part of the genus, or have been synonymized with other genera of hadrosaurs. The closest relative of Kritosaurus navajovius is Anasazisaurus horneri (or Kritosaurus horneri), which, together with close relatives such as Gryposaurus and Secernosaurus, form a clade called the Kritosaurini within the larger clade Saurolophinae. Location and time separate Kritosaurus and the slightly older, primarily Canadian Gryposaurus, along with some cranial details. Cast of an assigned egg The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Prieto-M√°rquez and Wagner in 2012, showing the relationships of Kritosaurus among the other Kritosaurini: Paleobiology The nasal crest of Kritosaurus, whatever its true form, may have been used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. There may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. =Diet and feeding= Lower jaw in inner view As a hadrosaurid, Kritosaurus would have been a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Feeding would have been from the ground up to ~4 meters (13 ft) above. If it was a separate genus, how it would have partitioned resources with the similar and contemporaneous Naashoibitosaurus is unknown. Paleoecology Tooth, Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano Kritosaurus was discovered in the De-na- zin Member of the Kirtland Formation. This formation dates from the late Campanian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period (74 to 70 million years ago), and is also the source of several other dinosaurs, like Alamosaurus, a species of Parasaurolophus, Pentaceratops, Nodocephalosaurus, Saurornitholestes, and Bistahieversor.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R. (2004). \\"Dinosaur Distribution\\". The Dinosauria (2nd). 517‚Äì606. The Kirtland Formation is interpreted as river floodplains appearing after a retreat of the Western Interior Seaway. Conifers were the dominant plants, and chasmosaurine horned dinosaurs appear to have been more common than hadrosaurids. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.Lehman, T. M., 2001, Late Cretaceous dinosaur provinciality: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, pp. 310-328. The geographic range of Kritosaurus remains in North America was expanded by the discovery of bones from the late Campanian-age Aguja Formation of Texas, including a skull. Additionally, a partial skull from Coahuila, Mexico has been referred to K. navajovius. Since the 1930s, Barnum Brown described that an unsubscribed species of Kritosaurus, the most likely candidate being Kritosaurus navajovius, had inhabited the late Maastrichtian Ojo Alamo Formation, the Javelina Formation in Texas and the El Picacho Formation, which was a flood plain type environment at the time of the Cretaceous. These fossils might be of an unknown species of hadrosaur or an undescribed specimen of Kritosaurus. This genus lived alongside numerous species of dinosaurs including the sauropod Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Bravoceratops, Ojoceratops, Torosaurus and a possible species of Eotriceratops, hadrosaurs which included a possible species of Edmontosaurus annectens, Saurolophus and Gryposaurus and the armored nodosaur Glyptodontopelta. Theropods from this environment which included Tyrannosaurus, smaller theropods like a species of Troodon and Richardoestesia, the oviraptorid Ojoraptorsaurus, indeterminate ornithomimids and dromaeosaurs. Non-dinosaur species that had shared the same environment with Kritosaurus included the giant pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus, various species of fishes and rays, amphibians, lizards, turtles like Adocus, and multiple species of mammals like Alphadon and Mesodma.

Although the team with the best record was normally intended to play the wild card team, the Cardinals played the Padres, rather than the wild card Astros, because the Cardinals and Astros are in the same division.

In the bottom of the first, Jim Edmonds's one-out solo home run put the Cardinals up 1‚Äì0. Then in the bottom of the third, Peavy's control slipped away as a bases-loaded wild pitch and a two-run single by Reggie Sanders gave the Cards a 4‚Äì0 lead. However, Sanders would provide more offense with a grand slam in the fifth. That would make the score 8‚Äì0 and give Sanders six RBIs in the game. The Padres would not go quietly, though. They would scratch out a run in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Khalil Greene off Brad Thompson after a leadoff double and single, then one more on a home run by Eric Young in the eighth off Randy Flores. After the Padres put runners on the corners in the ninth off Cal Eldred, Jason Isringhausen came on to close the deal. Yet, after Young's groundout scored a run, four consecutive hits with two outs, two of which by Mark Loretta and Brian Giles, made the score 8‚Äì5 and loaded the bases with the go-ahead run at the plate. Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez did not deliver as he struck out to end the game. =Game 2= Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri Pedro Astacio faced Mark Mulder in Game 2. The game remained scoreless until the bottom of the third when a walk to Abraham Nunez and an error by Khalil Greene on Yadier Molina's ground ball put two on with no out. After a sacrifice bunt, David Eckstein's fielder's choice scored a run, then a walk loaded the bases before Albert Pujols walked to score another. After a leadoff single and double, a fielder's choice by Molina and squeeze play by Eckstein made it 4‚Äì0 Cardinals in the fourth. In the top of the seventh, after being shutout for six innings, a double and two singles, the second of which by Xavier Nady scoring a run, made it 4‚Äì1 and put the tying run at the plate. However, a double play killed the rally and the Padres would only get one. Reggie Sanders got two more RBIs with a two-run double in the bottom half of the inning off Rudy Seanez. A bases-loaded hit-by-pitch to Nady by Juli√°n Tav√°rez made it 6‚Äì2 in the eighth, but Randy Flores struck out Mark Sweeney to end the threat while Jason Isringhausen retired the Padres in order in the ninth to give the Cardinals a 2‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 3= PETCO Park in San Diego, California This was the first postseason game in PETCO Park history, which had opened the previous year. Matt Morris faced former Cardinals pitcher Woody Williams. Albert Pujols drove in David Eckstein with an RBI double in the top of the first after Eckstein singled to lead off. Then Eckstein hit a two-run home run in the second to make it 3‚Äì0. The Cards did stop there, loaded the bases double, walk and hit-by-pitch before Reggie Sanders collected two more RBIs on a two-run double to make it 5‚Äì0 later. That would bring Sanders' RBI total to ten for the series. Then Yadier Molina's two-run single off Clay Hensley in the top of the fifth made it 7‚Äì0 Cardinals. In the bottom of the inning, Joe Randa doubled before RBI singles by Eric Young and Mark Loretta made it 7‚Äì2 Cardinals. Then home runs by Dave Roberts's in the seventh off Brad Thompson and Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez in the eighth off Juli√°n Tav√°rez made it 7‚Äì4 Cardinals, but Jason Isringhausen came on to slam the door on the Padres in the ninth despite allowing a single and walk with Ryan Klesko's groundout ending the series. =Composite box= 2005 NLDS (3‚Äì0): St. Louis Cardinals over San Diego Padres Atlanta vs. Houston =Game 1= Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia Andy Pettitte faced Tim Hudson in Game 1. Hudson struggled in his half of the first, giving up one run (on Morgan Ensberg's RBI single) on a walk and two hits, but got out of the inning with a crucial double play. Pettitte allowed a home run to Chipper Jones to tie the game, but otherwise cruised. The game remained 1‚Äì1 until the third when a bases-loaded (on a double and two walks) two-run single by Ensberg made it 3‚Äì1 Astros. A hit-by- pitch loaded the bases again, but Hudson got Adam Everett to ground out to end the inning. Next inning, Brad Ausmus hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Craig Biggio's sacrifice fly to make it 4‚Äì1 Astros. In the Braves' fourth, Andruw Jones hit a two-run home run to make it a one-run game. A walk and a bunt single put the tying run in scoring position later in the inning, but Brian Jordan grounded into a double play to end the rally. Pettitte would help his own cause in the seventh with the game still at 4‚Äì3, doubling and scoring on an RBI hit by Ensberg. It was now 5‚Äì3 and Hudson was finished. In the eighth, with Chris Reitsma pitching, the Astros opened the floodgates with a five-run rally, loading the bases on two singles and a walk before Jeff Bagwell's RBI single made it 6‚Äì3 Astros. John Foster in relief struck out Lance Berkman, but walked Ensberg to force in a run before a wild pitch scored another. After Jason Lane was intentionally walked to reload the bases, Orlando Palmeiro capped the inning's scoring with a two-run single that made it 10‚Äì3 Astros. The Braves scored two runs on Jones's RBI double in the eighth with two on off Dan Wheeler and the ninth on Johnny Estrada's RBI single after a leadoff triple off Russ Springer, but Mike Gallo got Rafael Furcal to hit into the game-ending double play as the Astros won Game 1 10‚Äì5. =Game 2= Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia Roger Clemens faced John Smoltz in Game 2. Smoltz ran into trouble when he allowed two consecutive singles with one out. After a forceout, Jason Lane singled in Lance Berkman to make it 1‚Äì0 Astros. He intentionally loaded the bases, but got out of the inning with no more damage done. Then the Braves struck back against Clemens. With two outs and two men on, Brian McCann came up in his first ever postseason at-bat. He then slammed a three-run home run to right field, becoming the first Brave ever to homer in his first postseason at-bat. That sparked the Braves as they would go on to score two more in the third on a two-run double by Adam LaRoche. Smoltz pitched masterfully and the Braves added to their lead in the seventh on RBI singles by Andruw Jones and Jeff Francoeur off Chad Qualls. The Braves' victory in Game 2 was their last postseason win until 2010. =Game 3= Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas Jorge Sosa faced Roy Oswalt in Game 3. Sosa fell behind early, allowing a double and hit-by-pitch before Morgan Ensberg's double and Jason Lane's sacrifice fly gave the Astros two runs in the first. The Braves tied the game in the next inning with back-to-back two out RBI singles by Brian McCann and Sosa. However, Mike Lamb hit the go-ahead home run in the bottom of the third. The two pitchers dueled until the bottom of the seventh when Chris Reitsma once again came into a close game. Reitsma allowed a double and single and the Braves' bullpen could do little to stop the Astros' rally. Lance Berkman hit an RBI single off John Foster, then Joey Devine allowed an RBI double to Ensberg and RBI single to Lane. Adam Everett's sacrifice fly off Jim Brower capped the inning's scoring. The Braves got a run in the eighth thanks to an RBI double by Andruw Jones off Dan Wheeler after Marcus Giles singled to lead off against Roy Oswalt, but no more. Brad Lidge pitched a scoreless ninth as the Astros won Game 3 7‚Äì3. =Game 4= Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas The final game of the series lasted 18 innings and set records as the longest game in the history of Major League Baseball's postseason, both in terms of time and number of innings. This was two innings longer than another Astros playoff game, Game 6 of the 1986 NLCS, which went 16 innings, with the New York Mets prevailing 7‚Äì6. This record was broken (by of an inning) by Game 2 of the 2014 NLDS, when the San Francisco Giants defeated the Washington Nationals 2‚Äì1. Coincidentally enough, Tim Hudson started both the 2005 and 2014 games, in the former as a Brave and the latter as a Giant. Additionally, Adam LaRoche was on the losing team in both games. In the third, the Braves loaded the bases on two walks and a hit-by-pitch off Brandon Backe when Adam LaRoche's grand slam put them up 4‚Äì0. In the fifth, Andruw Jones's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third made it 5‚Äì0 and knocked Backe out of the game. In the bottom of the inning, the Astros loaded the bases on three singles but only scored once on Orlando Palmeiro's sacrifice fly. Brian McCann's home run in the eighth off Wandy Rodriguez made it 6‚Äì1 Braves, but in the bottom of the inning, a grand slam by Lance Berkman off Kyle Farnsworth (two runs charged to Hudson) and a home run by Brad Ausmus in the ninth off Farnsworth (with the Astros down to their last out) sent the game to extra innings. The second half of the game included three innings of relief by Roger Clemens, appearing as a pinch-hitter in the 15th inning and pitching in relief for only the second time in his career (and appearing this time only because the Astros were out of pitchers). Chris Burke hit the game- ending home run in the bottom of the 18th off Atlanta rookie Joey Devine, giving Houston the series victory and sending them to the NLCS to face the St. Louis Cardinals. In addition to being at the time the longest postseason game in MLB history, it was also the only postseason game to include two grand slams, Lance Berkman's and Adam LaRoche's. Some commentators have pointed to this game as the greatest game in Houston Astros history, and one of the best games in the history of MLB playoffs. Even more remarkable than the game's length, perhaps, is the fact that the fan who caught Chris Burke's walk-off homer in the 18th was the same fan who had caught Lance Berkman's grand slam in the eighth (Section 102, Row 2, Seat 15); the fan later donated both balls to the Baseball Hall of Fame.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article_perspectives.jsp?ymd=20051014&content;_id=1249993&vkey;=perspectives&fext;=.jsp =Composite box= 2005 NLDS (3‚Äì1): Houston Astros over Atlanta Braves Series quotes Notes External links *STL vs. SDP at Baseball- Reference *HOU vs. ATL at Baseball-Reference National League Division Series National League Division Series Houston Astros postseason St. Louis Cardinals postseason Atlanta Braves postseason San Diego Padres postseason National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series 2005 in Atlanta 2005 in Houston 2000s in San Diego 2000s in St. Louis National League Division Series ","title":"2005 National League Division Series"},{"id":"2821249","text":"Genin may refer to: * G√©nin, a French family name * Genin (name), a Russian Jewish family name (–ì–µ–Ω–∏–Ω) * Robert Genin, (Russian: –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç –ì–µ–Ω–∏–Ω; 1884‚Äì1941), a Russian Jewish artist * John Nicholas Genin (1819‚Äì1878), a hatter in New York City and sometime associate of P.

It is now a nonprofit museum operated by Historic New England and open to the public several days a year. An admission fee is charged. History According to tradition, Forest Hall was built as a wedding gift for Charles Barrett and his bride by his father, a prosperous farmer in town who had invested in a glass factory, a toll road, a canal system, and, most successfully, in New Hampshire's first cotton mill. The interiors are elegantly furnished, and numerous reception rooms were designed for entertaining in a cosmopolitan manner. An elaborate all√©e was later added to the landscape, with a flight of stone steps flanked by maples rising up the hillside behind the house and leading to an elegant summerhouse. However, after the railroad bypassed New Ipswich, the town entered into a decline. Charles Barrett's descendants stayed on, but today Forest Hall remains essentially a relic of the Federal era. After 1887, the family used the house only in the summer-time. It was donated to Historic New England in 1950. Barrett House was one of the filming locations for the 1979 Merchant Ivory Productions film adaptation of the Henry James novel entitled The Europeans.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079123/locations See also *New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 137: Barrett House References External links * Historic New England website information Houses completed in 1800 Historic house museums in New Hampshire Museums in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Houses in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Historic district contributing properties in New Hampshire Historic New England New Ipswich, New Hampshire National Register of Historic Places in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire ","title":"Barrett House (New Ipswich, New Hampshire)"},{"id":"2821272","text":"Track map Buttonwillow Raceway Park is a motorsports park in Kern County, California, north of the town of Buttonwillow and northwest of Bakersfield.

History Jon Cougar Concentration Camp was formed in January 1994 in San Diego by Chris Fields, Clint Graham, Travis Spatter, and Travis Milligan. The band named themselves after a pun on musician John Cougar Mellencamp. They played their first show at The Casbah on January 31, 1994, and less than two months later self-released their first 7‚Äù EP. This would be the only recording with Clint and Travis, who both left the band. Bass guitarist Dave Swain was eventually added and the band continued as a trio. Their eponymous debut album came in 1995 on Second Guess Records. Til Niagara Falls was released on punk label BYO Records in 1997. This would be followed up by two more albums in 1998, Melon an album of new JCCC material, and Too Tough to Die a track for track cover of the Ramones album of the same name. During a break between tours and recording Dave and Chris joined The Queers and played on their album Punk Rock Confidential. Dwarves frontman Blag Dahlia (who had produced Melon) also invited Chris to join his band. Chris would join The Dwarves, and after being overwhelmed by being in three bands, left the Queers and ended Jon Cougar Concentration Camp. A final JCCC album Hot Shit was released in 1999. After a ten-year hiatus the band reunited in 2009. They recorded another song for song cover album, this time a version of Screeching Weasel's My Brain Hurts titled My Hair Hurts.

Played by Katee Sackhoff, she is a revised version of Lieutenant Starbuck from the 1978 Battlestar Galactica series. She is one of the show's main characters. Overview Described by a critic as \\"one of television's most complex, ever-evolving characters\\", the role of Starbuck changed over the run of the series. According to Sackhoff, Starbuck originally \\"didn't value her own life,\\" inspiring her readiness to die for her shipmates. By the end of the series, however, she is prepared to sacrifice herself for others because of her respect for all life. The character's physical appearance is based on Sackhoff's perception of Starbuck as an extremely fit, hard-drinking individual. \\"I didn't want Starbuck to be completely ripped,\\" said Sackhoff. \\"This is a girl who drinks most of her calories.\\" Kara Thrace bears some parallels to the original 1978 Starbuck character: both are portrayed as hot-headed and cocky fighter pilots, considered the best in the fleet, but with a tendency to challenge authorities and get into trouble. Both are avid gamblers and enjoy drinking, smoking cigars, and sex. Both have crashed and been marooned on a deserted planet, using a downed Cylon ship to make an escape.See You Can't Go Home Again (Battlestar Galactica) Both are best friends with Apollo. Kara had a relationship with Apollo's late brother Zak (mirroring the original Starbuck's on-and-off relationship with Apollo's sister Athena), affecting her relationship to Apollo and Zak's father, William Adama. The two characters differ both in their gender ‚Äì complicating Kara Thrace's relationships with other characters, notably Apollo ‚Äì as well as their outward appearance: whereas the original Starbuck, played by Dirk Benedict, was a slick, well- groomed ladies' man, Kara appears more rugged and grimy. USA Today described her as \\"the broken warrior, a young, idealistic soldier who has been fighting for all the right reasons, but has lost something along the way.\\" Character history = Background = The series bible developed for the TV series by Ron D. Moore states that Kara Thrace was born on Picon, but because her mother was in the Colonial Marines, she grew up as a military brat bouncing between different military bases on different planets during her entire childhood. The result is that she has no particular attachment to Picon, and lived on Caprica for some years before the TV series begins. As this information is from the series bible but never stated on-screen, it is unknown if Kara is canonically considered a Caprican or a Picon. However, her situation appears somewhat similar to Gaius Baltar, who grew up on Aerilon but moved to Caprica when he left home for university, then stayed the rest of his life there and abandoned all connections to his past. As Ron Moore has said, the Twelve Colonies only united under one government fairly recently, during the first Cylon war fifty years ago, thus many people still think in terms of affiliation to each of the \\"Twelve Tribes\\" - but technically under the new federal government, they switched to a residency system. Thus, as Moore explained, Baltar was able to become the Caprican delegate to the Quorum of Twelve as a naturalized citizen of Caprica, and considered himself to be a Caprican in nationality, but was not ethnically a \\"Caprican\\". Similarly, Kara may be ethnically a Picon, but loosely considers herself to be a naturalized Caprican.BSG Series Bible Kara Thrace had intended to be a professional pyramid ballplayer until her knee gave out. She eventually joined the military, where she found more acceptance than she had felt at home as an abused child.Family problems had previously been alluded to but the physical abuse is confirmed in \\"The Farm\\" when the Cylon Simon points out that every one of her fingers on both hands had been broken in the same place. Simon suggests she might not want to have children because of that, due to fears of passing the abuse on to them. There is a strong reaction from Kara but no further clarification on the topic within that episode. Later, in \\"Maelstrom\\", it is revealed her mother once punished her by placing her hand in a doorframe and slamming the door shut. Although Kara's mother, Socrata Thrace, had served as a Corporal in the first Cylon war, Kara was the first person in the family to become a commissioned officer. Socrata was not content with her daughter's military record, however, claiming she was not disciplined enough and was wasting her natural talent for flying. Kara's father, Dreilide Thrace, was a pianist. He left the family when Kara was a child, as Socrata had forced him to make a choice between his beloved piano playing, and picking up a steadier job to support the family. As a flight instructor at the Colonial flight school, Kara met and became romantically involved with one of her students, Zak Adama. Although Zak told her he did not want any special treatment from her, Kara passed him even though he failed basic flight, as she could not bring herself to crush his dreams. Her leniency cost Zak his life when he died on his first Viper mission. After his death, Starbuck met his father, William Adama. He realized Starbuck and Zak had been engaged and brought her under his command as a Lieutenant. Zak's death, however, created a wedge between Adama and his other son, Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama, who blamed his father for Zak's death, for creating an expectation that made Zak feel he needed to pursue becoming a Viper pilot in order to earn his father's affection. After the funeral, Lee broke off all contact with his father and Starbuck. Starbuck has a natural talent for flying and is considered Galactica's best pilot, although she also is known for being an avid card player and drinker as well as for an eruptive temper. Bill Adama loves Kara despite her flaws and considers her something of a surrogate daughter. However, Starbuck and Colonel Tigh share a mutual sense of loathing, despite - or perhaps because of - their similarities. At the time of the attack on the Colonies, she was second in command of Galactica's fighter wing. = After the attack = In a card game prior to Galactica's decommissioning ceremony, Starbuck responds to Colonel Tigh's mocking of her call sign and her stint in the brig as a cadet by alluding to Tigh's troubled relationship with his wife. Infuriated, he flips the table over, and she punches him in the face. He sends her to the brig, promising her that her career is over. However, Adama tells Tigh he is probably overreacting: while he agrees to leave Kara in the brig until after the ceremony, Adama says there is no need to ruin her career over the incident. Following the Cylons' attack on the Twelve Colonies, Starbuck is released to join the battle. Starbuck keeps her secret about Zak buried inside until after the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Soon after, when Starbuck fears she and the rest of humanity might be wiped out by the Cylons, she confesses her mistake to Lee. He is devastated. Later, he confronts her about it when she is chosen to train new Viper pilots aboard Galactica after several pilots are killed in a freak accident. The quality of recruits she is sent is subpar but still, she begins their training, ordering them to call her \\"God\\". Starbuck, blinded by guilt, washes all the pilots out for relatively minor flaws. She then admits her secret to Adama who is furious and heartbroken; he orders her to reinstate the trainees. On the next training mission, Starbuck and the trainees are ambushed by a small group of Cylon Raiders. Starbuck engages the Raiders on her own to cover the trainees' escape. With her Viper heavily damaged, she plummets toward the surface of a nearby desert moon and is forced to eject and take her chances on the surface. Starbuck is declared \\"missing in action\\", and Adama orders a search and rescue operation which strains the Galactica's crew and combat resources. On the surface, Starbuck struggles with a broken knee and near asphyxiation as her oxygen runs out. Luckily, she discovers the Cylon Raider she downed. Using her exceptional skill in flying, she figures out the Cylon technology and is able to pilot it back to the fleet. Depressed by her injuries, she initially needs the incentive to work on rehabilitation and is soon rubbing people the wrong way again. Even after she is able to move around without a cane, the injury sidelines her from flight for many episodes; when given tactical charge of a mission in one episode, she cannot fly the critical role because her knee still can't handle the G-force. During her recovery, a Number Two named Leoben is discovered aboard the Gemenon Traveller and is arrested. Adama assigns Starbuck to interrogate Leoben, believing she will be resistant to his mind games. Starbuck brutally interrogates Leoben, and he claims to have hidden a nuclear bomb on a timer somewhere in the fleet, threatening its detonation. Despite her often crude exterior, Starbuck is revealed to have a deep-seated faith in the gods, and engages in a debate about the existence of the Colonial gods vs. the Cylon god with Leoben, and whether the humanoid Cylons are actually \\"human\\". Leoben demonstrates that he is capable of breaking free and killing Starbuck at any time, but chooses not to, believing it is not God's will. During this period, Starbuck develops respect for Leoben, and he falls in love with her. She is genuinely saddened when President Laura Roslin orders him executed by airlock after he admits there is no bomb. She experiences a brief moment of emotional connection with Leoben when they touch palms through the glass of the airlock before he is executed. Afterwards, she privately prays to the Lords of Kobol, acknowledging that Leoben might not have had a soul, but if he did, asking that they take care of it. Starbuck's religious beliefs later come into play when President Roslin asks her to carry out a dangerous mission: return to Caprica and retrieve the Arrow of Apollo, a religious artefact supposedly pointing the way to Earth. Starbuck is at first reluctant, believing that Adama already knows the way to Earth, and is leading them there. Roslin is forced to reveal that Adama lied about knowing Earth's whereabouts to give the fleet hope. This deeply shakes Starbuck's trust in Adama, and she eventually is convinced to help Roslin. She takes the Cylon Raider she had captured, leading Adama to declare Roslin had suborned mutiny; he sends a detachment of Marines to terminate her presidency. During her time on Caprica, Starbuck encounters a Number Six (who beats her soundly) but manages to kill the Cylon out of sheer luck. She then meets up with Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon (a close friend she believed dead after he stayed on Caprica) and the Sharon Valerii copy pregnant with his child. Immediately realizing that Sharon is a Cylon, she attempts to kill her, while Helo stops her. This causes Sharon to flee in the stolen Raider, abandoning Starbuck and Helo. While attempting to find an alternative route off Caprica, they meet a resistance group that had been waging a guerrilla war against the Cylons, led by fellow pyramid player Samuel Anders. Kara and Anders develop a bond over their shared past as pyramid players and develop a romantic relationship. At one point Starbuck is injured in battle, captured, and wakes up in a Cylon \\"farm\\" as part of their experiments to create human/Cylon hybrids, but is originally led to believe she is in a hospital run by the resistance. A Cylon named Simon, posing as a doctor, experiments on her, claiming to be treating her for internal injuries, and keeps her in a drugged state. Without her knowledge, apparently one of her ovaries is surgically removed before she escapes; a fact discovered only much later. Starbuck escapes with the help of the resistance, killing Simon. Sharon returns with a Cylon Heavy Raider, and Starbuck plans to return to the fleet with her and Helo. However, she personally promises Anders that she will return with reinforcements to rescue the Resistance, giving Anders her dog tags as part of her promise. She, Helo, and Sharon arrive on the planet Kobol, joining Roslin in her search for the Tomb of Athena. Sharon is able to guide them to the tomb, and Adama joins them. They are able to place the Arrow of Apollo in the tomb and gain a rudimentary map to Earth. Soon after returning to Galactica, the Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by Rear Admiral Helena Cain, is discovered. Cain promotes Starbuck to Captain and assigns her as the CAG of the Pegasus. After the fleet leadership denies her request to return to rescue the Caprican resistance fighters, Starbuck is depressed and guilt-stricken: she has broken her word, failed her duty, and assumes the man she is \\"hung up on\\" is either dead or will be soon. After Lee Adama's promotion to Commander and appointment as commander of the Battlestar Pegasus, Starbuck transfers back to the Galactica and assumes the role of its CAG. = New Caprica = The complication of Starbuck and Lee's relationship was furthered when a drunken night on the newly found planet, New Caprica, ended with Starbuck and Lee having a one-night stand where they both expressed their love for one another. When Lee woke up alone the next morning, he soon discovered Kara had proposed to and married Anders. Lee soon marries newly commissioned Lieutenant Anastasia Dualla while Starbuck moves planetside with Anders. After an all- night celebration of the first founder's day for New Caprica, tired and hungover, Starbuck and Tigh put their differences behind them. They even greet each other fondly following Tigh's demobilization and arrival at the colony. Her relationship with Lee, however, worsened to the point that they were not on speaking terms and he had little interest in helping her, even when Anders contracted a serious bout of pneumonia. After the Cylon invasion of New Caprica, she is imprisoned inside a mental facility, designed to look like her own former Caprican apartment. While there, a Leoben model tries to convince her they are destined to be lovers. For four months Starbuck denies his advances, killing him several times despite knowing he would be back. Then she is presented with a young girl named Kacey that Leoben claims is their daughter, created with the ovary removed when she was in the egg farm. Initially, she refuses to believe it and wants nothing to do with the girl, but when Kacey is badly injured in a fall down a staircase, she calls on Leoben for help and seems to grow more attached to both of them. During the uprising on New Caprica, however, Starbuck once again kills Leoben and escapes with Kacey. In the episode \\"Exodus\\" Part II, it is revealed Kacey is not Starbuck's child; the Cylons had abducted her. Kacey and her real mother are reunited on the Galactica's flight deck after the flight from New Caprica. Starbuck is left there alone on the flight deck, stunned and in disbelief. = Back with the fleet = After her situation on New Caprica and the truth about Kacey, she is left simmering with rage, which causes her to be reckless and destructive, almost killing herself in a Viper training exercise. After being removed from flight status by then-Major Lee Adama, she takes up residence in the pilot's mess along with Colonel Tigh, drinking and lowering the morale of Galactica's pilots by attempting to draw divisions between New Capricans and those who stayed with the fleet. Admiral Adama gives her an ultimatum; either straighten up and act like an officer or 'get the hell off his ship' and find another ship to live on. Starbuck changes her attitude after Adama literally knocks her to the ground after she thumbs her nose at him. Starbuck's relationship with Lee Adama takes another dramatic turn after she angrily challenges him to a brutal and emotional boxing match aboard Galactica. Their intense feelings for each other soon lead to an affair drawing resentment from their respective spouses. However, when Lee asks Starbuck to divorce Sam, she refuses due to her strong religious beliefs on the sacrament of marriage. Lee argues she is breaking her vows just by being with him, but Starbuck states she's merely bending the rules. Lee then decides he can no longer cheat while still married to Dualla. Later, Lee and Anders begin to voice their dislike for each other just as Starbuck's Raptor is shot down by the Cylons and she is reported missing. Anders vows to find her, but their position is outnumbered; Lee orders Anders at gunpoint to stay put and help defend their outnumbered position. Anders remains defiant. Starbuck suffers severe hand burns in the crash and is rescued by Dualla. After they escape the doomed algae planet, Starbuck makes one final effort to have a relationship with Lee, this time offering to leave Anders if he will leave Dualla. Lee chooses to try to make his own marriage work instead. Kara's experiences with Leoben, as well as her troubled childhood, eventually come back to haunt her. She has nightmares involving both Leoben and the mandala supposedly connected to her \\"destiny\\". She asks an oracle about her dreams and is told Leoben understands her better than she understands herself, and he will show her \\"destiny.\\" During a patrol over a gas giant where the fleet is refuelling, she sees a Cylon Raider and pursues it into a storm system which resembles her mandala. She is forced to abandon the pursuit when her Viper is at risk of implosion from the pressure. Although she felt several impacts during her pursuit, then-Chief Galen Tyrol finds no damage to her Viper and gun camera footage showed no evidence of any Raider, leading many to believe Kara had been hallucinating. Adama is concerned Kara might have burned out, but he leaves the decision to ground her up to Apollo as CAG. Apollo decides to give her another chance and offers to fly as her wingman on her next patrol. During the patrol, Starbuck sees another Raider and again pursues. Her Viper is hit by debris and she is knocked out. She experiences a conversation with an Avatar with the appearance of Leoben set in her apartment on Caprica. The avatar forces Kara to confront her past, the abuse she received from her mother and the guilt she feels for leaving her mother to die alone. The avatar comments Kara has been running from her past just as she has been running away from death for her entire life and implies eventually she will have to confront her fears and her \\"destiny\\". Moments before regaining consciousness in her Viper, Kara realizes the person she is speaking to is not the Cylon Leoben Conoy, and states, \\"You're not Leoben.\\" The avatar grins and replies, \\"Never said I was.\\" She awakens in her Viper cockpit as Apollo is calling for her to break off and ascend, or the atmospheric pressure will kill her. Starbuck keeps flying into the storm and tells Lee to leave her. She is encompassed by white light and certain calmness. Apollo witnesses her Viper imploding, with no sign that she survived. In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, \\"Crossroads, Part II\\", Starbuck reappears in the same Viper that she was flying at the time she disappeared and is discovered by Apollo, appearing to be alive and well, but the reason for her sudden resurrection has yet to be revealed. She tells Apollo not to \\"freak out\\" it is really her and she has been to Earth and will show them the way. Kara returns in Season 4 believing she had only been absent for six hours, but Anders informs her she was really gone for two months. The crew is wary of her return except for Lee, who greets her with an enthusiastic and long hug, and is so grateful for her return he is willing to overlook the possibility she is a Cylon, and he may be willing to accept her even as a Cylon. This becomes evident in Lee's questioning of his father whether if it had been his son, Lee's brother, who returned, would it have made a difference whether he was Cylon or human. She experiences frustration upon her return to Galactica, as no one believes it is really her, and because of President Roslin's refusal to be guided by what she believes is a Cylon trick. The crew continues on the course Roslin had previously decided upon and move further away from the area Kara believes is Earth's true location. She attempts to encourage Adama to follow her suggestions, but when he refuses, she fears his being romantically linked to Roslin has unjustly influenced him. Feeling hopeless and fearing as they make more jumps farther away she will lose the \\"feeling\\" of Earth's location, she becomes desperate and holds President Roslin at gunpoint. During her standoff with the President, she tries to reason and appeal to the President's emotions. She hands the gun to Roslin and insists she shoots her if she really believes she is a Cylon, to which Roslin responds to by saying \\"They made you perfect, didn't they?\\" Roslin fires the gun, but misses Starbuck and hits a framed portrait of herself and Adama. Starbuck is thrown into the brig and has a hostile confrontation with Adama, who angrily says, \\"You are so stupid you couldn't wait. You just lost your best ally. Now who is going to save you?\\" She responds, \\"Well, it certainly isn't you,\\" and says she will fight to show them Earth's location until her death. She also accuses him of playing \\"wet nurse\\" to the president, to which he responds by throwing her to the floor and leaving her crying. Later, after Adama attempts to have a conversation with Roslin, which turns into a psychological sparring argument, he rethinks his decision and allows Kara to secretly look for Earth on a barge called Demetrius. = Aboard Demetrius - Looking for Earth = After taking command of Demetrius to find a way to Earth, Starbuck finds herself at odds with the crew when her orders cause them to doubt her command ability. With only two days remaining until the ship must return to the Fleet, her command is further compromised by her refusal to explain her actions and her decision to bring the Cylon Leoben aboard after having found him in a damaged Cylon Heavy Raider. Eventually, she finds herself torn between following Leoben's advice to forge an alliance with the fragmented Cylons, or distrusting him because of what that risk entails. The tension with the crew leads to a mutiny, after which Kara acknowledges her errors and instead takes a small crew with her in a Raptor to visit the base ship. There, she meets with the base star's hybrid and is told, \\"You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end.\\" This echoes the warning given by the first hybrid to Kendra Shaw at the conclusion of Razor. = Earth = In \\"Sometimes a Great Notion\\", Starbuck and Leoben look for the Colonial beacon which led them to Earth. They find the wreckage of a Viper with Starbuck's tail number and what appears to be her charred corpse. Both Kara and Leoben are shocked by this discovery and do not understand what it means. After removing the dog tags and wedding ring, Kara asks \\"If that's me lying there, then what am I?\\". He responds by backing away as if recoiling from the realization that she is indeed the \\"Harbinger of Death.\\" She returns to the wrecked Viper and, after carefully wrapping the remains in a parachute shawl, she incinerates the body on a funeral pyre. Starbuck's description as \\"the harbinger of death\\" and Leoben's caution to her not to venture into the woods, \\"you might not like what you find,\\" were elements of the episode's homage to the original Planet of the Apes. Dr. Zaius gave Colonel Taylor the same warning, and instructed Dr. Cornelius to read from the sacred scrolls that man was the harbinger of death. Like Taylor, Starbuck was a human astronaut and military officer exploring a post- apocalyptic Earth. = Mutiny = In \\"The Oath\\", Captain Thrace discovers civilians and a few mutinous Marines and crewmen arming themselves for battle. She rushes back to her quarters to prepare for battle, grabbing her sidearms and ammunition. Kara then finds Lieutenant Margaret \\"Racetrack\\" Edmondson, Charlie Conner, and a few others preparing to execute Lee Adama. She kills a Marine holding Adama and wounds Lieutenant Hamish \\"Skulls\\" McCall. Along with Lee Adama, Kara runs into several other loyal Colonials including President Roslin, Admiral Adama, and Colonel Tigh. While searching for Adama, Kara and Lee free loyalists found in the brig which includes Anders, who is then shot by a mutinous marine upon leaving. Kara, refusing to leave his side, pressures Lee and those who escaped to leave her in order for them to search for Adama. = The song = In the episode \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\", Starbuck encounters a pianist in Joe's Bar who is trying to compose a new song. At first, she becomes annoyed by his repetitious playing, stating he reminds her of her father when he did nothing but play the piano and she mentions how her father left her and her mother to pursue it as a career. Over the course of the episode, Starbuck befriends the pianist and ends up working with him to try to finish his song. Toward the end, the piano player writes down the notes Starbuck hums out on a sheet of paper. The pattern reminds Starbuck of a drawing of coloured dots the Cylon-Human child, Hera Agathon had given to her earlier. She lines the child's drawing up with the notes the composer had drawn and they match exactly. When Starbuck and the pianist play the notes, the song is instantly recognized by Saul Tigh and Tory Foster ‚Äì who are sitting at a nearby table with Ellen Tigh ‚Äì as the song (\\"All Along the Watchtower\\") they heard in their heads when they learned they were the final Cylons. Ellen, of course, remembers it from Earth. A bewildered Saul asks Starbuck where she heard the song. Starbuck responds she played it as a kid and begins to mention her father, but stops short when she realizes the piano player, her father, was either a figment of her imagination or a vision. In the episode \\"Daybreak, Part I\\" Starbuck tries to get answers from Anders about the song, even turning notes into numbers to see if there is a mathematical solution. In \\"Daybreak, Part II and III\\", after getting the coordinates from Anders for the Cylon Colony, Starbuck joins in on the rescue mission for Hera. After saving Hera, and as the Colony is being destroyed, Starbuck is ordered by Admiral Adama to jump the Galactica away to safety. Although she has no coordinates, Adama tells her to make a blind jump to anywhere. Recalling the musical notes and the numbers she extrapolated from it, she inputs them into the computer; the resulting jump puts Galactica near a habitable planet the fleet decides to settle on. It is revealed this new planet is our world, some 150,000 years ago; Admiral Adama names it \\"Earth\\", believing it better matched the dream the fleet had been seeking than did the original Earth (which had been found destroyed by nuclear war). Once settled on the world, Kara says a final goodbye to Admiral Adama and tells Lee she's leaving - her 'job is done', having indeed led the human race to their end (the end of their journey) - and will not be coming back. Kara then disappears into thin air and is not seen again. Seeing her gone, Lee tells her ghost she \\"won't be forgotten\\", echoing a moment from the \\"Daybreak\\" episodes. What really happened to Kara is left ambiguous. According to Katee Sackhoff, \\"So when she at the end was saying goodbye to [Anders], I think that she was saying goodbye to their bodily forms,\\" she said. \\"I think she knew, especially if he says, 'I'll see you on the other side,' I think she's with him. I think they're both dead, but I think she's with him. That was a decision that we made, because I selfishly wanted her at peace, and the only way to do that was to have her with someone at the end, or to be with the person she wanted to be with. I don't know. That's kind of where I think she is. She's with Anders playing pyramid in the sky somewhere.\\" Casting There was considerable outrage from fans of the original series when producers announced their intention to re- cast Starbuck and Boomer as women, with the decision to change Starbuck's gender especially controversial due to the character's popularity. Ronald D. Moore recounts: \\"When [the fans] heard Starbuck was going to be a woman, it was just like, There can never be peace between us! Blood has been spilled! We just decided that we didn't care.\\" Moore explains the gender switch: \\"Making Starbuck a woman was a way of avoiding what I felt would be 'rogue pilot with a heart of gold' cliche.\\" Producers were looking for a mid-30s actress with a tough military demeanour for the role. Katee Sackhoff was not quite who they had envisaged, being a very feminine 23-year-old in real life. However, they were impressed by her acting ability. Director Michael Rymer explains: \\"Katee came in and my first reaction was, Well, she's the best actress, but she's too feminine.\\" Katee Sackhoff admits: \\"Up to that point, I had always played pretty stereotypical blond roles. This was definitely a stretch for me. I wear high heels and dresses. I am a total girly girl. Now people avoid me at the gym.\\" Executive producer David Eick recounts: > I was at home, looking at old tapes of auditions, just bemoaning the fact > that we didn't have a Starbuck. It was the most talked-about role; this was > not the role to fall on our faces with. Jenny, my wife, happened to be in > the room when Katee was reading, and in an off-hand kind of way said, What's > the matter with you, she's right there! I was like, Really? We brought > [Katee] back, and it was like, Oh! She's right! Executive producer Ronald D. Moore wrote, \\"Katee auditioned for the role along with many other actresses, and simply blew them all away. Sometimes we get lucky.\\" For Sackhoff, the reaction to the reimagined role was difficult at first. \\"At the start, I was young; I was stupid,\\" said Sackhoff. \\"I let the fact that people questioned whether or not a woman could play a man's role dictate how I was going to play her.\\" Fans opposed to the casting of a female in the popular role expressed their discontent during production on the miniseries, and Sackhoff even received a death threat before the start of filming. During the 2004 San Diego Comic Con, the actress was booed: > I was booed. It was lovely. At that point, I'd seen the miniseries and I > knew I'd done a good job. I had my confidence back. I didn't care anymore. Critical response Despite the initial backlash, even by original male portrayer Dirk Benedict, Katee Sackhoff's Starbuck has become one of the show's most popular characters. Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Melanie McFarland notes: \\"[Starbuck], played with a tomboyish swagger by Katee Sackhoff, is fast becoming the latest in a long line of feminist television icons.\\" Wired's Hugh Hart praises Sackhoff's portrayal: \\"The actress's rough-and-tumble take on the fleet's most mesmerizing fighter jock will doubtless continue to render gender utterly irrelevant.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen states: \\"Sackhoff has set TV's new standard for action-heroine cool and complexity.\\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times praised Sackhoff for creating one of the most fabulous female characters on television. Salon.com's Laura Miller states: In 2005 Sackhoff won a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. Slate magazine named the character as one of the reasons they were looking forward to the return of the show in fall 2007. In a TV special to familiarize viewers with the series, Benedict and Sackhoff appeared together to discuss her character. Benedict offered an olive branch, saying, \\"Can a Starbuck buy a Starbuck a Starbuck?\\"  References  External links * Kara Thrace at the Battlestar Wiki *Kara Thrace at Syfy Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) characters Fictional aviators Television characters introduced in 2003 Fictional lieutenants Fictional military captains Fictional smokers Fictional women soldiers and warriors ","title":"Kara Thrace"},{"id":"2821281","title":"Office on Violence Against Women"},{"id":"2821285","text":"is a famous Noh play of the third category (plays about women) by Zeami Motokiyo. Its central character is a real life figure, the great 9th-century poet Ono no Komachi, who was also famed for her beauty. The play depicts Komachi at the end of her life, when her beauty has faded and she is living in great poverty. On the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month, during the Festival of Stars, the Abbot of Sekidera visits her in her hut, taking two priests and a child, so that they can hear her talk about poetry. During the course of their conversation, the abbot realizes her identity and is astonished and delighted. He invites her to come with them to the festival, but she declines. The child dances part of a gagaku dance for her, the Manzairaku. Inspired, she starts to dance herself, and continues to do so until dawn. In the dawn light she ponders the transience of life, and her irrational shame at what she has become, which Zeami tragically underscores by setting the action during the Tanabata festival, which celebrates two young lovers.

According to the Associated Press, he was \\"the world's tallest basketball player.\\" In anticipation of joining the NBA, Ri worked out in Canada, where he was scouted by numerous teams. But he was unable to play in the league because of the U.S. ban on trade with North Korea, which is set forth in a piece of legislation called the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. The U.S. Department of State permitted Ri to compete in the country in 2000, on the main condition that none of Ri's salary could be repatriated to North Korea. North Korean officials responded by refusing to let Ri leave. Kim Jong- il told NBA scout Tony Ronzone he would allow Ri to leave North Korea and play professional basketball if the team paid Kim's regime in wheat.

Early life Mayfield was born in Overton, Texas on April 12, 1881, the son of John Blythe and Mary (D'Guerin) Mayfield. He graduated from high school in Timpson, Texas, and then from Tyler Business College. In 1900, Mayfield graduated from Southwestern University, and he studied law at the University of Texas at Austin from 1900 to 1901. He continued to study law, was admitted to the bar in 1907, and practiced in Meridian, Bosque County. Mayfield was also involved in several business ventures including the wholesale grocery industry and operation of several farms. Political career =State politics= A Democrat, he served in the Texas State Senate from 1907 to 1913, and as a member of the Texas Railroad Commission from 1913 to 1923. =United States Senate= In 1922, Mayfield was one of six candidates who challenged five-term United States Senator Charles A. Culberson for the Democratic senatorial nomination. In the ensuing runoff between Mayfield and former Governor James E. Ferguson, Mayfield was labeled the \\"Ku Klux Klan candidate\\" because he and the KKK supported prohibition, while Ferguson emphasized an anti-prohibition stance; at the time the sale of alcoholic beverage was illegal throughout the United States under the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution. After securing the endorsement of the other U.S. Senator from Texas, Morris Sheppard of Texarkana, Mayfield won the Democratic nomination. In the general election held on November 7, 1922, Mayfield faced the Independent candidate George Peddy, who also had the backing of the Republican Party. Because Peddy's name was not on the ballot, the insurgents waged a write-in campaign. Peddy's write-in effort netted him a third of the vote. After the election, Peddy challenged the results on the grounds of disputes over filing deadlines and other technical issues. A Senate committee ruled in Mayfield's favor, and the full Senate voted to seat him, but his swearing in was delayed until December 1923. in 1928, Mayfield faced a large field of candidates, and was defeated in the runoff by Tom Connally, a member of the United States House of Representatives from McLennan County; winning the Democratic nomination was tantamount to election, and Connally went on to win the seat and succeed Mayfield. In 1930, Mayfield sought the Democratic nomination for governor, but finished seventh among eleven candidates; the successful candidate was Ross Sterling. Retirement and death After losing his Senate seat, Mayfield moved to Tyler. He continued to practice law and manage his business interests until retiring in 1952. Mayfield died in Tyler on June 23, 1964, and was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Tyler. Family Mayfield married Ora Lumpkin on June 10, 1902; they were the parents of three sons.

The United States large cent was a coin with a face value of 1/100 of a United States dollar. Its nominal diameter was 1 inch (28.57 mm). The first official mintage of the large cent was in 1793, and its production continued until 1857, when it was officially replaced by the modern-size one-cent coin (commonly called the penny). Large cents were made of nearly pure copper, or copper as pure as it emerged from smelting, without any deliberate addition of other metals (such as occurs in bronze). General history First struck in 1793, the large cent was coined every year from 1793 to 1857 except 1815. When the United States declared war in 1812 against Great Britain, coinage was affected. The wartime embargo against shipments made it so the mint could not get any new copper planchets, which were imported from Great Britain, to strike coins.Whitman The Official Guide Book to United States Coins 64th Edition 2010 Page #93 The mint made do with what supply it had and struck coins into 1815. After the war ended in 1815, the mint wasted no time in ordering new planchets. For an unknown reason no coins were dated 1815 from the supply the mint had in the interim.. There may have not been a significant supply of planchets left and when new ones were received it may have been easier to use the old design and date.1815 the only date since 1793 for which no cents can be found In addition to the copper shortage, people also hoarded precious metals during the war. Altered and fantasy cents with the 1815 date occasionally appear.Striker sells 1784 half disme reproduction The Philadelphia Mint produced all large cents, which contained twice the copper of the half cent. This made the coins bulky and heavy, bigger than modern-day U.S. Quarters. =Flowing Hair cents, chain reverse (1793)= A 1793 Flowing Hair chain Cent A 1794 large cent The obverse featured a bust of Liberty with a reverse of a ring of chains. Henry Voigt's design was almost universally criticized in its time for its unattractiveness and perceived allusion to slavery. It bears the distinction, however, of being the first official coinage minted by the United States federal government on its own equipment and premises. 36,103 were minted. Its low survival rate, in addition to its small mintage, coupled with being the first regular federal issue and a one-year design and type, has created an extremely strong demand from generations of numismatists. As a result, all surviving specimens command high prices ranging from $2,000-$3,000 in the absolute lowest state of preservation to over $500,000 in the highest. =Flowing Hair cents, wreath reverse (1793)= A 1797 large cent The Mint caved in to the intense ridicule later in 1793, and Mint Director David Rittenhouse ordered Adam Eckfeldt to revise the obverse and reverse designs. Liberty's bust was redesigned with even longer, wilder hair, and the chain was removed from the reverse in favor of a wreath. Scholars are undecided as to what plant or plants are depicted in the wreath, with several varieties extant. Total mintage of the wreath reverse numbered about 63,000 pieces. =Liberty Cap cents (1793‚Äì1796)= An 1811 Classic Head large cent Rittenhouse was dissatisfied with Eckfeldt's designs, and with the criticism of the Chain cents fresh in his mind, he hired Joseph Wright to do yet another redesign in the denomination's troubled first year. Wright's design faced Liberty to the right and \\"tamed\\" her wild hair. The Phrygian cap was added as an ancient symbol of freedom. The reverse design was revised to a recognizable laurel wreath, and future Chief Engraver Robert Scot had a hand in several minor revisions to the design over the next three years. This design was more successful and it was continued into 1796. In 1795, planchets became too thin for the edge lettering because of a weight reduction, so the mint stopped edge lettering on the cent, and the rest of these coins were made with a plain edge. Four coins from 1795 are known to have a reeded edge.Yeoman, R.S. A Guide Book of United States Coins 2009 edition. =Draped Bust cents (1796‚Äì1807)= Robert Scot redesigned the whole of United States coinage for 1796, applying a new design featuring a bust of Liberty wearing a drapery at the neckline and a ribbon in her flowing hair. The reverse design now featured an olive wreath. As with earlier types, several minor revisions to the design were made in the first few years, with the final 1797 design lasting through the end of the type in 1807. Around 1860, an altered 1803 obverse die (re-engraved ‚Äú1804‚Äù) and an 1820 reverse die were used to create several unofficial ‚Äúrestrikes‚Äù of the rare 1804 cent. While not genuine 1804 cents, they are sometimes collected along with the originals and are listed in various numismatic magazines and A Guide Book of United States Coins. =Classic Head cents (1808‚Äì1814)= John Reich, assistant to Chief Engraver Scot, was appointed by new Mint Director Robert Patterson to redesign Scot's Draped Bust cent (along with every other circulating coin design). The so-called \\"Classic Head\\" derives its name from the fillet worn by Liberty on the obverse, though the fillet was worn only by male athletes in ancient Greece. The copper used during the years in which Classic Head cents were minted was of a higher quality, containing less metallic impurity. Consequently, they were softer and more prone to wear and corrode more quickly than issues before or after. As a result, unimpaired, high-grade specimens are especially difficult to obtain and fetch strong premiums when they appear on market, especially with original red or red-brown mint luster. =Coronet cents (1816‚Äì1857)= An 1850 Braided Hair cent  Matron Head, or Middle Dates (1816‚Äì1839)  As a response to public criticism of the Classic Head, the Mint assigned Chief Engraver Scot to redesign the cent in 1816. This newest design enlarged the obverse portrait, giving Liberty a much more mature look (leading to the Matron Head reference), and surrounded the portrait with stars along the outer edge of the coin. The \\"Matron head\\" design was modified in 1835 to give Liberty a younger look and matron head cents continued to be made until 1839. Similar to the 1804 restrike cent, around the 1860s-1870s, several \\"restrikes\\" were made by a third party not affiliated with the Mint. While not genuine 1823 cents, they are nevertheless sometimes collected alongside their genuine counterparts. The restrike cannot be confused with the original, as it was minted with an 1813 reverse. Braided Hair, or Late Dates (1839‚Äì1857; 1868) Facing more negative public reaction, the Coronet cents were redesigned in 1835 by new Chief Engraver Christian Gobrecht. This last major change to the coin updated the obverse by giving Liberty a slimmer, more youthful appearance. Minor tweaks continued through 1843, and the 1843 design prevailed through the end of mintage in 1857. Some 11 years after the large cent was discontinued, a mint employee coined several large cents dated 1868, almost certainly for sale as instant rarities to numismatists. About a dozen and a half of these unofficial issues, struck in both copper and nickel, are known to survive.

The shooting guard-small forward spent 15 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with six teams. High school and college career Wingate played high school basketball for the Dunbar Poets of Dunbar High School, where he played alongside fellow NBA players Muggsy Bogues, Reggie Lewis, and Reggie Williams. The 1981‚Äì82 Poets finished the season at 29‚Äì0, and the following year, after Wingate's graduation, finished 31‚Äì0 and were ranked first in the nation by USA Today. At the end of his senior season, it was expected Wingate would attend the University of Maryland, but instead he decided to attend Georgetown University. As a freshman for the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team during the 1982‚Äì83 season, Wingate was named to the Big East Conference all- rookie team. The following season, he made the transition from a guard-forward hybrid to playing primarily at the shooting guard position, as the small forward position was filled be incoming freshman and fellow Dunbar alum Reggie Williams. During his sophomore year, Wingate led the team in steals and scored about 11 points per game, en route to Georgetown winning the 1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Wingate's junior season saw Georgetown miss repeating as national champions, losing to Villanova University in the final of the 1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. It also was one of Wingate's best defensive seasons, earning career-high totals in assists and steals, and leading the team with 16 points in their championship match-up against Villanova. He averaged 16 points a game in his senior year, trailing only Williams, and played 1,000 minutes without being fouled out. Upon graduation, Wingate was the Hoyas' third all-time leading scorer behind Eric Floyd and Patrick Ewing. Professional career Wingate had a 15-year NBA career spanning from 1986 to 2001. He was selected in the second round with the 44th pick of the 1986 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. His selection in the second round surprised some, with 76ers coach Matt Guokas saying, \\"In a lot of people's eyes, he was a first-round pick\\" and that he was \\"one of the people we would have considered\\" had they not traded their first-round pick. After fighting for a spot on the 76ers roster, Wingate made his debut on November 2, 1986. He played nine minutes in his debut against the Atlanta Hawks, and made his first start against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 10, 1987, scoring 22 points in 46 minutes. He finished the season having played in 77 games, averaging two assists and 8.8 points per game. He played for the San Antonio Spurs, Washington Bullets, Charlotte Hornets, Seattle SuperSonics and New York Knicks. Wingate retired with the Sonics in 2001, after having played a total of 28 games in his final three NBA seasons. Personal life Wingate has five children: Cynthia Alixandra, Brandi Allstin, Davion, Ashley and Ameenah.

He arrived in Port Adelaide on 19 September 1839. Early life Giannoni was born on 29 March 1814 in Rimini, Italy, the son of Petro and Maria (n√©e Gambuti). He did not receive any formal education in Rimini, but received much experience in seamanship. Giannoni left Rimini in around 1838, after narrowly evading arrest for being a member of the Young Italy movement. He fled to England and is recorded as a crewman on the English ships Mount Edgecombe and Sabina in 1838 and 1839 respectively. Career On 3 May 1839, he boarded the London-based Recovery which arrived in South Australia on 19 September 1839. He was hired to work at the Survey Department by Surveyor General Lieutenant Edward Charles Frome, whom Giannoni had become acquainted with while on the Recovery. In early 1841, Giannoni left Adelaide after the Survey Department retrenched him and found employment as an oarsmen for a whale fishery at Encounter Bay. He worked as a whaler for some seven years, returning to Adelaide in 1848, where he started a modestly successful land-owning enterprise. Like many other immigrants, he left for the goldfields near Mount Alexander and Castlemaine during the 1851 gold rush. Giannoni became a cab driver some time in 1861 and then a bus driver in 1873; he returned to the cab industry in 1878, following the introduction of trams in South Australia. Personal life and death On 13 November 1848, Giannoni married domestic worker Matilda (n√©e Deputron), who died of tuberculosis on 5 February 1854. After the death of his first wife, Giannoni remarried on 16 August 1954, but his second wife Ann (n√©e Tickner) died in childbirth on 27 May 1855. Two months later, on 27 July, he married Tickner's friend, Mary (n√©e Clapton), who had emigrated to England with her. Giannoni and Clapton had five children: Antonio (1856‚Äì1942); Samuel (1859‚Äì1941); Mary (1861‚Äì1916); Peter (1863‚Äì1947); and a fifth child, also named Samuel, who died three days after his birth in 1857. Giannoni died on 6 September 1883 in Kensington, Adelaide. The cause of death was listed as \\"old age and disease of the bladder\\". He was buried at the West Terrace cemetery. His son Peter was later elected to a two- year term as Mayor of Kensington. Giannoni, who had only learnt how to properly sign documents in his 40s, spelled his surname inconsistently, including as \\"Gianoni\\", \\"Gannone\\", and \\"Gannoni\\", the last of which was adopted in both Giannoni's final will and by his descendants who nonetheless continued to pronounce it as \\"Giannoni\\". Legacy A bust of Giannoni in Osmand Terrace, Norwood was unveiled on 4 November 1993. A portrait of him, photographed in 1872, still exists too.

The black section at the bottom contains the planetary reduction gear, and the black object on top of the motor is the optical rotary encoder for position feedback. This is the steering actuator of a large robot vehicle. Industrial servomotors and gearboxes, with standardised flange mountings for interchangeability A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors. Servomotors are not a specific class of motor, although the term servomotor is often used to refer to a motor suitable for use in a closed-loop control system. Servomotors are used in applications such as robotics, CNC machinery or automated manufacturing.  Mechanism  A servomotor is a closed-loop servomechanism that uses position feedback to control its motion and final position. The input to its control is a signal (either analogue or digital) representing the position commanded for the output shaft. The motor is paired with some type of position encoder to provide position and speed feedback. In the simplest case, only the position is measured. The measured position of the output is compared to the command position, the external input to the controller. If the output position differs from that required, an error signal is generated which then causes the motor to rotate in either direction, as needed to bring the output shaft to the appropriate position. As the positions approach, the error signal reduces to zero and the motor stops. The very simplest servomotors use position-only sensing via a potentiometer and bang- bang control of their motor; the motor always rotates at full speed (or is stopped). This type of servomotor is not widely used in industrial motion control, but it forms the basis of the simple and cheap servos used for radio- controlled models. More sophisticated servomotors use optical rotary encoders to measure the speed of the output shaft and a variable-speed drive to control the motor speed. Both of these enhancements, usually in combination with a PID control algorithm, allow the servomotor to be brought to its commanded position more quickly and more precisely, with less overshooting. = Servomotors vs. stepper motors = Servomotors are generally used as a high- performance alternative to the stepper motor. Stepper motors have some inherent ability to control position, as they have built-in output steps. This often allows them to be used as an open-loop position control, without any feedback encoder, as their drive signal specifies the number of steps of movement to rotate, but for this the controller needs to 'know' the position of the stepper motor on power up. Therefore, on first power up, the controller will have to activate the stepper motor and turn it to a known position, e.g. until it activates an end limit switch. This can be observed when switching on an inkjet printer; the controller will move the ink jet carrier to the extreme left and right to establish the end positions. A servomotor will immediately turn to whatever angle the controller instructs it to, regardless of the initial position at power up. The lack of feedback of a stepper motor limits its performance, as the stepper motor can only drive a load that is well within its capacity, otherwise missed steps under load may lead to positioning errors and the system may have to be restarted or recalibrated. The encoder and controller of a servomotor are an additional cost, but they optimise the performance of the overall system (for all of speed, power and accuracy) relative to the capacity of the basic motor. With larger systems, where a powerful motor represents an increasing proportion of the system cost, servomotors have the advantage. There has been increasing popularity in closed loop stepper motors in recent years. They act like servomotors but have some differences in their software control to get smooth motion. The main benefit of a closed loop stepper motor is its relatively low cost. There is also no need to tune the PID controller on a closed loop stepper system. Many applications, such as laser cutting machines, may be offered in two ranges, the low-priced range using stepper motors and the high-performance range using servomotors.  Encoders  The first servomotors were developed with synchros as their encoders. Much work was done with these systems in the development of radar and anti-aircraft artillery during World War II. Simple servomotors may use resistive potentiometers as their position encoder. These are only used at the very simplest and cheapest level, and are in close competition with stepper motors. They suffer from wear and electrical noise in the potentiometer track. Although it would be possible to electrically differentiate their position signal to obtain a speed signal, PID controllers that can make use of such a speed signal generally warrant a more precise encoder. Modern servomotors use rotary encoders, either absolute or incremental. Absolute encoders can determine their position at power-on, but are more complicated and expensive. Incremental encoders are simpler, cheaper and work at faster speeds. Incremental systems, like stepper motors, often combine their inherent ability to measure intervals of rotation with a simple zero-position sensor to set their position at start-up. Instead of servomotors, sometimes a motor with a separate, external linear encoder is used. These motor + linear encoder systems avoid inaccuracies in the drivetrain between the motor and linear carriage, but their design is made more complicated as they are no longer a pre-packaged factory-made system.  Motors  The type of motor is not critical to a servomotor and different types may be used. At the simplest, brushed permanent magnet DC motors are used, owing to their simplicity and low cost. Small industrial servomotors are typically electronically commutated brushless motors. For large industrial servomotors, AC induction motors are typically used, often with variable frequency drives to allow control of their speed. For ultimate performance in a compact package, brushless AC motors with permanent magnet fields are used, effectively large versions of Brushless DC electric motors. Drive modules for servomotors are a standard industrial component. Their design is a branch of power electronics, usually based on a three-phase MOSFET or IGBT H bridge. These standard modules accept a single direction and pulse count (rotation distance) as input. They may also include over-temperature monitoring, over- torque and stall detection features. As the encoder type, gearhead ratio and overall system dynamics are application specific, it is more difficult to produce the overall controller as an off-the-shelf module and so these are often implemented as part of the main controller.  Control  Most modern servomotors are designed and supplied around a dedicated controller module from the same manufacturer. Controllers may also be developed around microcontrollers in order to reduce cost for large-volume applications. Integrated servomotors Integrated servomotors are designed so as to include the motor, driver, encoder and associated electronics into a single package.

Biography Vladimir Shamanov received the Hero of the Russian Federation decoration for his service in Chechnya, but human-rights groups have criticized him strongly for war crimes committed by Russian Federation troops under his orders during the First Chechen War of 1994-1996 and the Second Chechen War of 1999-2009. Shamanov was removed from duty in January 2000 for \\"health reasons\\", and for a period he served as a civilian politician, becoming the elected governor (2001-2004) of the Ulyanovsk Oblast region of the Russian Federation. As of 2007 Shamanov operated as a counselor to Russia's defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, and as co-chairman of the U.S - Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs (USRJC) which seeks to determine the fates of U.S. personnel who remain unaccounted-for from World War II and from the Cold War Era.

Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm. During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo moon landing missions. Early life Beatrice Hicks was born in 1919 in Orange, New Jersey, to William Lux Hicks, a chemical engineer, and Florence Benedict. Hicks decided at an early age that she wished to be an engineer. While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks' desired career path, some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer, viewing it as a socially unacceptable role for a woman. She graduated from Orange High School in 1935 and received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1939, one of only two women in her class. During college, Hicks worked in the treasury office of an Abercrombie & Fitch store as a telephone operator, and in the university's library. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant, where she studied the history of Edward Weston's inventions and took additional classes at night. Career In 1942 Hicks took a job at the Western Electric Company, designing and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as vice president in charge of engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute of Technology. While pursuing a master's degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hicks completed some graduate electrical engineering courses at Columbia University. In 1950 Hicks and other women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization, the goal of which was to advance female engineers and increase female participation in engineering. The organization was incorporated as the Society of Women Engineers two years later. Hicks served as the president of the organization for two consecutive terms, from 1950 to 1952. In 1963 the Society of Women Engineers presented their highest honor, the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, to Hicks. Hicks toured the United States, championing the cause of female engineers through outreach and speaking engagements. She believed that while female engineers would initially be closely watched, they would also be quickly accepted. In 1948 Hicks married fellow engineer Rodney Duane Chipp, who held two director-level engineering positions before starting a consulting firm. In 1960 the couple were selected by the National Society of Professional Engineers for a month-long research and speaking tour of South America, which focused on international cooperation between American and South American engineers. When Chipp died in 1966, Hicks sold off Newark Controls Company and took over her late husband's consulting business. Hicks was also selected to serve on the Defense Advisory Committee for Women in Services between 1960 and 1963, was the director of the First International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists, and represented the United States at four International Management Congresses. Hicks died on October 21, 1979, in Princeton, New Jersey. Awards and professional honors Because of her role in Newark Controls Company, Mademoiselle magazine named Hicks \\"Woman of the Year in Business\\" in 1952. In 1978 Hicks was invited to join the National Academy of Engineering, the highest professional honor in engineering, and became the sixth woman to join the organization. In 2002 Hicks was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Hicks received honorary doctorates from Hobart and William Smith College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. She was the first female recipient of an honorary doctorate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She was a member of both the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Hicks invented a special gas-density monitor for which she received a patent, this monitor proved to be valuable in the rapidly growing American space program. In 2017, Hicks was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.https://www.invent.org/inductees/beatrice-hicks References External links *Profile at the National Women's Hall of Fame *Profile at the Society of Women Engineers 1919 births 1979 deaths American women engineers New Jersey Institute of Technology alumni Stevens Institute of Technology alumni Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alumni People from Orange, New Jersey Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Engineers from New Jersey 20th-century American engineers 20th-century women engineers ","title":"Beatrice Hicks"},{"id":"2821382","text":"The 1364 in the shop being restored thumb184x184pxToppenish Depot The Northern Pacific Railway Museum is a railroad museum in Toppenish, Washington.

Life Garshin was the son of an officer, from a family tracing its roots back to a 15th-century Tatar prince named Garsha (or Gorsha), who entered into the service of Ivan the Great.Peter Henry, A Hamlet of His Time, Vsevolod Garshin: The Man, His Works, and His Milieu, Willem A. Meeuws (1983), p. 27 He attended secondary school and then the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute. He volunteered to serve in the army at the start of the Russo-Turkish War in 1877. He participated in the Balkans Campaign as a private, and was wounded in action. He was promoted to the rank of an officer at the end of the war. He resigned his commission soon after in order to devote his time to literary efforts. He had previously published a number of articles in newspapers, mostly reviews of art exhibitions. His experiences as a soldier provide the basis for his first stories, including the very first, \\"Four Days\\" (Russian: \\"–ß–µ—Ç—ã—Ä–µ –¥–Ω—è\\"), based on a real incident. The narrative is organized as the interior monologue of a wounded soldier left for dead on the battlefield for four days, face to face with the corpse of a Turkish soldier he had killed. Garshin's empathy for all beings is already evident in this first story. Despite early literary success, he had periodical bouts of mental illness. Garshin attempted to commit suicide by throwing himself down the stone stairs leading to his apartment building. Although not immediately fatal, he died as a result of his injuries in a hospital in April 1888, at the age of 33. Work Garshin's work is not voluminous: it consists of some twenty stories, all of them included in a single volume. His stories are characterized by a spirit of compassion and pity that some have compared to Dostoevsky's. In A Very Short Novel he examines the infidelity of a woman to a crippled hero. The story displays Garshin's talent for concentration and lyrical irony. That Which Was Not and Attalea Princeps are fables with animals and plants in human situations. The second of these stories has a sense of tragic irony. In Officer and Servant he is a forerunner of Chekhov; it is an excellently constructed story conveying an atmosphere of drab gloom and meaningless boredom. From the Reminiscences of Private Ivanov ‚Äî the title story in the most recent English language collection of Garshin's work ‚Äî has the same Russo-Turkish War setting of Four Days, and includes as minor players the characters from Officer and Servant. His best-known and most characteristic story is The Red Flower; it fits in the series of lunatic- asylum stories in Russian literature (including Gogol's Diary of a Madman (1835), Leskov's Hare Remise (1894) and Chekhov's Ward No. 6 (1892)). In 1883 Garshin was the model for the younger in Ilya Repin's painting Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan.

He is also one of Ichigo Kurosaki's best friends. Because Ichigo first read Yasutora's name off a nametag, he pronounced his family name as due to the variable pronunciations of kanji, and Ichigo continues to call him this throughout the story. Conception and development Bleach author Tite Kubo stated that he began creating the characters \\"from their faces.\\" According to Kubo, Chad \\"looked like he was of Mexican heritage\\" so he decided to make him half-Japanese and half-Mexican.Shonen Jump #51. Volume 5, Issue 3. March 2007. VIZ Media. 328. Character outline =Personality= Chad is a tall teenager of Japanese and Mexican descent, and appears to be older than he really is. He has a tattoo on his left shoulder that consists of a winged heart and a snake, with a ribbon that reads 'Amore e Morte' (\\"love and death\\" in Italian) and has a very big mouth. During his early years, Chad was extremely violent. Exploiting his advantage in size, he intimidated and hit any child who annoyed him. Oscar Joaquin de la Rosa, his grandfather, 'Abuelo' inspired Chad to be gentle. Afterwards, Oscar gave Chad an old Mexican coin, which he treasured after Oscar's death. Since then, Chad vowed that he would never fight unless it was to protect others, as instructed ‚Äî even if his own life was in danger. However, because of his constant involvement with gangsters, Chad gained a reputation as a ruthless gangster himself. Chad is a quiet person with a very kind heart and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). As he and Ichigo have a longtime relationship, having met each other while fighting off a group of bullies. Since then both decided to fight together, Chad becomes determined to train and get stronger in order to aid Ichigo in his fights as Ichigo and his enemies start becoming much stronger than Chad along the series. Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. In a recent omake, when Orihime is trying to catch Nozomi with a plush cat, she captures Chad instead, who begins to cuddle with it. Besides his physical strength being able to lift 400 kg with ease, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 11th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo is ranked 23rd. =Abilities= Chad's armored arms. When first introduced, Chad had no special powers aside from his unusual strength and endurance. After his encounter with the cockateel containing the soul of Y≈´ichi Shibata, he starts to detect the approximate locations of spirits and hollows, but cannot fully see them. Only after saving Karin Kurosaki from a hollow, during the hollow-slaying match between Ury≈´ and Ichigo, does Chad begin to fully see spirits. This also awakens what Chad later learns to be his latent powers as a Fullbringer, a human who manipulates the soul of an object to its full potential as the result of absorbing residual spirit pressure from a Hollow while unborn. Having been raised by his grandfather to take pride in his skin and Mexican heritage, Chad's Fullbring manifests on his body in the form of armor on his right arm called the .Note: The Spanish grammar used to refer to Chad's arms is faulty, due to the mixing of grammatical genders. Chad's armor increases his strength beyond its already impressive level, and enables him to fire powerful energy blasts from his fist. After training with Renji, Chad gains an improved version of his armored arm. He also gains a new special attack called To perform it, the flanges on Chad's arm open up and he punches the enemy. While in Hueco Mundo, stating that his powers are closer to that of a hollow, Chad's Fullbring is strengthen by the environment to the point of manifest armor on both arms instead of just his right. In addition, he also gains the ability to move at high speeds in a manner similar to flash steps and sonido. Chad's full-powered right arm is still called the Brazo Derecha de Gigante but is now used for defense instead of offense (though it's still more powerful offensively than his original arm). Brazo Derecha de Gigante becomes a shield that extends from his hand to some distance beyond his forearm with the same intricate pattern as before. Chad's armored left arm, used for attack, is known as the . With this arm, Chad gains a special attack known as , a powerful fist containing energy from all his fingers. Plot overview A few days after Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper, Chad accepts a cursed cockatiel whose previous owners have all died horrible deaths. The bird is in fact the container for the spirit of a dead child, Yuichi Shibata, placed there by a hollow who uses him as bait. Chad is forced to fight the hollow despite not being able to see it, assisted by Rukia Kuchiki. Ichigo defeats the hollow then performs Konso on Yuichi. Later on, when Ury≈´ Ishida's duel with Ichigo unleashes a multitude of hollows upon the town, Chad is pressed into battle with another hollow. It is this event that awakens his spiritual powers, which manifest as armor on his right arm. After Rukia is taken back to Soul Society, Chad and Orihime Inoue are trained by Yoruichi Shihouin to consciously call upon their powers when needed. After a week, Chad leaves for Soul Society with Orihime, Ury≈´, Yoruichi, and Ichigo. When the group is separated once entering Seireitei, Chad ends up alone. Chad meets his match in Shunsui Ky≈çraku, captain of the 8th Division in the Gotei 13. Ky≈çraku easily beats Chad, leaving him heavily injured but alive. After being freed by Kenpachi Zaraki of the 11th Division and Rukia is rescued, Ury≈´, Chad, Ichigo and Orihime depart for the living world. In Karakura Town, Ichigo, Chad and Orihime are attacked by Ulquiorra Schiffer and Yammy Riyalgo, two of the first arrancars to invade Karakura Town. When the second invasion led by the Espada Grimmjow Jeagerjaques commences, Chad is attacked by an arrancar but is saved by Ichigo. Noting that he is unable to fight alongside Ichigo, Chad turns to Kisuke Urahara for help, asking for training. After Orihime is captured by S≈çsuke Aizen, Chad joins Ichigo and his friends to rescue her from Hueco Mundo. After making their way to Las Noches and the group splits up, Chad runs into the Privaron Espada Gantenbainne Mosqueda. His victory is short-lived, however, as the 5th Espada, Nnoitora Jiruga, severely wounds him and leaves him for dead. Chad and Gantenbainne are eventually found by the Exequias, who plan to finish them off, but Retsu Unohana and Isane Kotetsu interrupt, and the former heals him. He later appears with Rukia and Renji to aid Ichigo and fight off the Exequias, but is defeated by the Cero Espada Yammy. After the 17 month time skip, Chad appears as an ally of Xcution, a group of humans with supernatural powers called Fullbring. Having learned that he is a Fullbringer himself, Chad agrees to help restore Ichigo's Soul Reaper abilities for Xcution's needs. However, unaware that Xcution was using him for their plan to attack the Soul Society, Chad is attacked by Sh≈´kur≈ç Tsukishima and falls under the influence of his Fullbring to serve as an enforcer. But when he and Orihime experience a mental breakdown after Tsukishima attempts to \\"add\\" more details to their fake memories, Chad is knocked out by Urahara and Isshin before his mind is restored after Tsukishima's eventual death. Not too long afterwards, Chad accompanies his friends (sans Uryu) to Hueco Mundo in order to save the Arrancars from the Wandenreich. When Ichigo departs to assist the Soul Society against the Wandenreich invasion, Chad, Orihime and Urahara are grievously injured by Quilge Opie and fall to his arrows. They are then saved when Opie is killed by Grimmjow, whom they later join forces with. Ten years later, Chad is now a professional boxer and challenger to the WBO World Heavyweight Title. Reception Readers from the manga have liked Chad's character, with him appearing in the characters popularity polls from Bleach. In the first poll he ranked 6th with 2,109 votes. However, in following polls he did not appear in the top ten, being replaced by other characters. His character has also been featured in several types of merchandising from Bleach such as action figures, key chains and plush. Various publications from manga, anime and other media have commented on Chad's character, adding praise and criticism. Popcultureshock.com writer Carlos Alexandre praised his character as, like each character, he is very convincing and particularly liked his pacifist attitude despite his appearance. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network (ANN) agreed on this although he found his visual design to be stereotypical, but his personality was unique. Jarred Pine from Mania Entertainment found Chad's reveal of spiritual powers as his favourite from volume 5 of the manga, additionally noting that it does not drag out the story. He also praised how Chad teams up with Ichigo's sister, Karin, in order to fight an attacking Hollow. However, Carl Kimlinger from ANN noted this not to be very surprising for viewers if they have watched other series based on manga from Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump as it is common theme in those series. Bryce Coulter from Mania praised Chad's fight against Shunsui Kyoraku, noting his pacifist attitude along with Shunsui's as well as his flashback which intensifies his friendship with Ichigo. Jian DeLeon of Complex magazine named him tenth on a list of \\"The 25 Most Stylish Anime Characters,\\" and stated, \\"Sado gets this spot because of his amazing burgundy motorcycle jacket. He's also not afraid to rock cream- colored pants, nor does he stray from patterned shirts.\\" See also * List of Bleach characters References Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength Bleach characters Fictional boxers Fictional monster hunters Fictional demon hunters Comics characters introduced in 2001 Male characters in anime and manga Orphan characters in anime and manga Teenage characters in anime and manga ","title":"Yasutora Sado"},{"id":"2821425","text":"Mary Early (born 1975, Washington, DC) is a sculptor living and working in Washington DC.

History The station began construction in 1952 and started generating electricty in 1958. At the time of its opening it was the largest power station in Scotland. It was initially operated by the South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB). The station was constructed to take advantage of post-WW2 expansion of the Fife and Lothian coalfields. Coal was supplied by Merry-go-round trains. It was capable of generating 760 MW peak load, and when commissioned could produce up to one third of Scotland's total electricity needs. Specification Kincardine power station had one of the first 120 MW turbo-alternator units in the UK (the first to be commissioned was at Blyth A). The first set at Kincardine was commissioned on 28 December 1958. The steam conditions at the turbine stop valve were 1,500 psi and 1,000¬∞F with reheat to 1,000¬∞F (103.4 bar and 538¬∞C). An even more advanced 200 MW set was installed at Kincardine in the 1962. This included boilers rated at 1,350,000 lb/h (170.1 kg/s) capacity delivering steam at 2,350 psi and 1,050¬∞F (162 bar and 566¬∞C) with reheat to 1,000¬∞F. The boilers were by John Brown Land Boilers Limited. The architect was Robert Matthew and the consulting engineers were Kennedy and Donkin. Operations The station was formally opened by the Queen in October 1960. The station had cost ¬£36,250,000, about ¬£4M less than had been estimated in 1955. Upon opening it had three 120 MW units, 200 MW units were added in 1962 and 1963. Water for the steam condensers was abstracted from and returned to the Forth. When fully commissioned the station drew 1,025 cubic feet per second (29.02 m3/s) of cooling water. There were concerns about the re-circulation of discharged warm water back into the intake. The topography of the river was modelled which demonstrated that re- circulation would not be significant and the length of the culvert could be reduced. Ash from the boilers was used to reclaim land from the estuary held behind a 9,000 ft (2743 m) embankment. Early in the operational life of the station it was found that aluminium brass condenser tubes were failing through corrosion. Research indicated the absence of a protective iron oxide film on the condenser tubes at Kincardine. A program to inject ferrous sulphate into the cooling water was instigated to provide iron to aid the formation of an oxide film. Semi-automatic start up, loading and shutdown of generating sets was introduced at Kincardine in June 1966. This was associated with the change in the operation of the station from base load to two-shift working. This was the first time that such control has been used in the UK. The rail facilities at Kincardine included 5 coal discharge filler pits including two tipplers, 8 railway sidings, an oil discharge facility, and a loco shed. These facilities were extant in 1996 but had been removed by 2007. Operation of the station ceased in 1997, and the facility had been demolished by 2001. Redevelopment A 275 kV substation still occupies part of the site, this has 275 kV high voltage connections to/from Currie, Fetteresso, Grangemouth, Longannet and Tealing substations. The northern approach to the new Clackmannanshire Bridge built across the Firth of Forth and completed in late 2008 cuts across the extreme west end of the site. The site was used for the storage of a large quantity of track materials for the rebuilding of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link, which is now operating, and is currently being used as a coal unloading and stockpiling area. This facility was latterly owned by the privatised Scottish Power utility group.

Most benrishi specialize in patent law, but are also allowed to practice in copyright, trademark, unfair competition and trade secret law. While benrishi are often referred to as \\"patent attorneys\\" in English, their qualifications differ from patent attorneys in the United States and Germany in some aspects. Benrishi are not necessarily required to possess legal educations. Benrishi also have greater authority than patent specialists in other countries, as they are allowed to represent clients in administrative proceedings and out-of-court bargaining related to IP rights. The benrishi examination (ÂºÅÁêÜÂ£´Ë©¶È®ì benrishi-shiken) covers a broad range of intellectual property law (patent, utility model, design, trademark, treaties, copyright and unfair competition law) and limited fields of law and science. The benrishi examination consisted of three stages. The first stage is the multiple choice exam, the second stage is the essay exam, and the final stage is the oral exam. , 9,300 benrishi are practicing in Japan, approximately as many per capita as in the United States. Entrance to the profession is regulated by a low pass rate (about 7% as of 2008; it was less than 3% until about 1997) on the benrishi examination only. The Japan Patent Office and government officials have expressed an interest in attracting more individuals to the profession as part of a broader series of reforms in Japan's legal professions. Different from a U.S. patent agent, a benrishi is qualified to prosecute trademark applications, assist clients in copyright and licensing matters, and to represent clients in some court proceedings and custom seizure matters. History The benrishi profession was adopted from German patent law, which Japan duplicated during the Meiji era. The Benrishi Law (ÂºÅÁêÜÂ£´Ê≥ï benrishi-h≈ç) was passed in 1921 and remained almost unchanged through the end of the 20th century. In 2001, after a decade of economic stagnation, the Benrishi Law was changed, and the role of the benrishi in the patent system was changed significantly. Benrishi were allowed to represent clients in adversarial proceedings before customs courts and in arbitration. The law was revised again in 2002 to allow benrishi to represent clients in courtroom litigation, either independently of or in cooperation with attorneys. Benrishi has been qualified to be a legal representative for appealing to the Intellectual Property High Court (the exclusive jurisdiction) representing the client against the adverse decision of Trial Board (consisting of three administrative trial judges) of Japan Patent Office, and even up to the Supreme Court (The Benrishi Law Article 6). Benrishi can also represent the infringement cases if it meets the criteria (The Benrishi Law Article 6bis).

[1983] 1 S.C.R. 147 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada constitutional decision on the jurisdiction of the superior courts to hear constitutional arguments. The unanimous Court found that Courts of Inherent Jurisdiction such as the Quebec Superior Court had concurrent jurisdiction to hear constitutional cases. Background A series of multimedia companies were involved in the production of several television shows and sold air time to sponsors. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) brought a claim against the companies to the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB). CUPE applied to have the companies declared a single party for the purposes of a collective bargaining proceedings. The companies argued that it was impossible as some of them were not inter-provincial companies and thus were outside of federal jurisdiction. The CIRB found that the companies were within federal jurisdiction, and subsequently granted CUPE's application. The companies, in turn, applied to the Quebec Superior Court for a writ of evocation against the CIRB. The Superior Court denied the application on grounds that they did not have jurisdiction, holding that the Federal Court Act gave the power to hear this sort of case to the Federal Court. On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, the court held that the Superior Court had jurisdiction and granted the writ of evocation. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction over constitutional issues. Opinion of the Court The unanimous Court upheld the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. The opinion was given by Puisne Justice Julien Chouinard. The Court acknowledged the fact that the Federal Court Act gave jurisdiction to the Federal Courts on matters of federal agencies. However, the Act \\"does not apply to supersede the superintending and reforming power of the Superior Court\\". The federal government can create a court \\"for the better administration of the laws of Canada\\" as per section 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Such a court may be given exclusive power over the application of federal laws. However, s 101 does not grant the federal government authority to remove the power of superior courts to determine the constitutionality of federal laws. The government can only create concurrent jurisdiction rather than exclusive jurisdiction. In the end the Court held that the companies were not engaged in matters within the federal powers by creating TV programming and so the CLRB did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. Instead the superior courts had jurisdiction. The Court affirmed the Court of Appeal's granting of the writ. Aftermath The case largely established concurrent jurisdiction between statutory courts and courts of inherent jurisdiction. However, in later decisions such the jurisdiction trilogy of Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario, the Douglas College case, and the T√©treault-Gadoury case, have seemingly reversed the ruling with little mention of the case itself.

The route runs northwest to southeast through Bucks County in suburban Philadelphia from PA 611 in Warrington southeast to Interstate 95 (I-95) in Bensalem. PA 132 is a commercial route lined with shopping centers throughout much of its length. It is named Street Road and is five lanes wide for much of its length. The route was also designated as the Armed Forces and Veterans Memorial Highway in 2005. From west to east, PA 132 crosses PA 263 and PA 332 in Warminster; PA 232 in Southampton; PA 532 in Feasterville; and U.S. Route 1 (US 1), the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276), PA 513, and US 13 in Bensalem. Street Road was included in William Penn's survey plans and completed by 1737. The road was paved by 1911 and received the PA 132 designation by 1927. The route was widened into a multi-lane highway and extended to I-95 by 1970. An E-ZPass-only interchange with the eastbound direction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened in 2010. Route description PA 132 westbound past Davisville Road in Warminster Township PA 132 begins at an intersection with PA 611 (Easton Road) in Warrington Township, heading to the southeast on Street Road, a four-lane road that alternates between a divided highway and an undivided five-lane road including a center left-turn lane. West of PA 611, Street Road continues as State Route 3001 (SR 3001), an unsigned quadrant route, to Lower State Road. From its western terminus, the route heads through commercial areas before crossing the Little Neshaminy Creek and entering residential areas. At the Valley Road intersection, the road crosses into Warminster Township and continues through suburban development as West Street Road. PA 132 enters commercial areas as it comes to a junction with PA 263 (York Road). Farther southeast, the road intersects Mearns Road. After crossing the New Hope Railroad at-grade about north of that railroad meeting SEPTA's Warminster Line, the route passes through industrial and business areas before intersecting PA 332 (Jacksonville Road). Past the PA 332 intersection, the road continues through a mix of homes and businesses as East Street Road. Upon crossing Davisville Road, PA 132 enters Upper Southampton Township and intersects Maple Avenue as it passes more businesses as Street Road. The road crosses PA 232 (Second Street Pike) in the community of Southampton before passing over SEPTA's abandoned Fox Chase/Newtown Line and reaching an intersection with Knowles Avenue/Churchville Road. After running through wooded residential areas, the road crosses into Lower Southampton Township at the Stump Road intersection and passes under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line. PA 132 westbound past the PA 513 intersection in Bensalem Township Street Road continues past a mix of residential and commercial development as it comes to an intersection with PA 532 (Bustleton Pike) in the community of Feasterville. After the PA 532 junction, the road heads past several businesses before turning south-southeast near more suburban development. PA 132 turns southeast again and crosses Philmont Avenue prior to entering Bensalem Township. Upon entering Bensalem, the route passes over SEPTA's West Trenton Line on a bridge and intersects Trevose Road as it enters commercial areas again in the community of Trevose. After a bridge over CSX's Trenton Subdivision, PA 132 crosses under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) immediately before an intersection with Old Lincoln Highway, becoming a divided highway. A short distance later, the road reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 1, with all movements complete except a ramp from eastbound PA 132 to southbound US 1, before turning south. The route comes to an E-ZPass-only ramp that provides access to and from the eastbound Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276); this ramp has no access from eastbound PA 132. PA 132 continues south-southeast past more businesses, becoming an undivided road again past the Richlieu Road intersection and passing two entrances to Parx Casino and Racing and the Bucks County Visitor Center to the northeast of the road. The road gains a center left-turn lane and heads past more commercial development, crossing Mechanicsville Road and Knights Road before coming to the PA 513 (Hulmeville Road) intersection. Farther southeast, PA 132 reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 13 (Bristol Pike) before ending at a diamond interchange with I-95 just north of the Eddington station along SEPTA's Trenton Line that follows Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Past I-95, Street Road passes over the Northeast Corridor and continues as SR 2007 to State Road. In 2016, PA 132 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 54,000 vehicles between Trevose Road/Old Street Road and Old Lincoln Highway to a low of 25,000 vehicles between Maple Avenue and Knowles Avenue/Churchville Road. The entire length of PA 132 is part of the National Highway System. History Street Road was originally surveyed in the late 17th century, with the road being included in the original survey plans of William Penn for the Province of Pennsylvania. For much of its history it has been known as \\"the Street road\\". It was called this because, contrary to present usage where \\"street\\" is a synonym for road, the original use of the word \\"street\\" was a paved road. The entire length of the road was completed by 1737. Street Road became a paved road by 1911; at the time, the route was not defined as a legislative route. By 1927, PA 132 was designated onto part of Street Road, running from US 611 (now PA 611) in Warrington Township southeast to US 13 in Bensalem Township. PA 132 westbound past the PA 232 intersection in Southampton In February 1950, two traffic signals were installed along the road in Bensalem. Street lights were installed along the stretch of PA 132 in Bensalem in December 1952. In August 1956, Bensalem police chief William Riempp urged for the stretch of Street Road through the township to be completely reconstructed as it was one of the most dangerous roads in the state. The state widened the portion of PA 132 through Upper Southampton and Lower Southampton townships from to in 1956; this widening was called a \\"useless waste of public funds\\" by the Lower Southampton Township planning commission as the road was not anticipated to handle increasing traffic volumes. The portion of Street Road between US 1 and US 13 in Bensalem Township was repaved in mid-1957; however the shoulders were not repaved, resulting in a drop between the travel lanes and the shoulder. In August 1958, the Pennsylvania State Highway Department (PDH) considered reducing the speed limit on the two-lane stretch of PA 132 between Davisville Road and Gravel Hill Road in Upper Southampton Township in order to make the road safer. On January 9, 1960, the PDH awarded a contract worth $1,488,493 to James D. Morrisey, Inc. to upgrade the section of PA 132 between Neshaminy and Warminster to a four-lane divided highway. In November 1961, the portion of Street Road southeast of US 13 was closed to allow for construction of I-95 (Delaware Expressway), which would include an interchange with Street Road; this interchange was planned to be completed in 1962. In January 1962, a proposal was made to split PA 132 onto separate roadways through Feasterville, with the westbound direction using Irving Place a block north of Street Road. In January 1963, plans were made to widen the entire length of PA 132 to with a median strip, with a portion in Feasterville to be widened to . The widening was originally planned to be completed in 1965. By March of that year, the widening project was shelved as the state felt they should receive federal funds to fund the project. With the widening shelved, businesses from Feasterville and Southampton along with State Senator Marvin Keller led a push to get the portion of Street Road through the two communities paved, which was in disrepair and saw a lot of accidents. In May 1965, construction began to widen the portion of PA 132 between US 1 and US 13 in Bensalem to a four-lane divided highway. On August 27, 1965, a stretch of new concrete pavement along PA 132 in Bensalem was completed, with work then to begin on rebuilding the original roadway to make it a divided highway. The widening of Street Road into a divided highway between US 1 and US 13 was completed in December 1965. The proposed widening of PA 132 in Feasterville drew concerns from residents who feared they would lose their homes. In July 1967, the state made plans to add left turn lanes at PA 132's intersections with US 611 in Warrington and PA 263 in Warminster in order to reduce crashes. In 1969, work was underway in widening Street Road between PA 263 and PA 332 in Warminster. The widening of PA 132 into a divided highway was completed in 1970. As a result of this improvement, a portion of the road was relocated east of Feasterville, with the former alignment becoming Old Street Road. Also by this time, the route was extended southeast to an interchange with I-95. PA 132 westbound in Warminster Township In May 1971, plans were announced to install a traffic signal at PA 132 and Mechanicsville Road in Bensalem Township, an intersection that saw many accidents. Plans were discussed in September 1975 to reconstruct PA 132 to handle increasing traffic volumes, with work projected to begin between 1977 and 1980. On November 22, 1976, Warminster Township supervisors voted against building sidewalks and curbs on a portion of Street Road in the township in order to not burden taxpayers. In 2005, a bill was introduced into the Pennsylvania General Assembly designating the entire length of PA 132 as the Armed Forces and Veterans Memorial Highway; this bill was signed into law by Governor Ed Rendell on October 27, 2006. On May 28, 2007, PA 132 was officially named the Armed Forces and Veterans Memorial Highway in a ceremony held in Warminster, with State Representative Kathy Watson in attendance. On November 22, 2010, an E-ZPass-only ramp with access to and from the eastbound Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bensalem Township opened, intended to provide improved access to Parx Casino and reduce congestion at the Pennsylvania Turnpike interchange with US 1. The intersection of PA 132 and Knights Road in Bensalem Township was ranked by Time magazine as the most dangerous intersection in the United States from 2003 until 2012.

Task Force Smith, a U.S. task force of 400 infantry supported by an artillery battery, was moved to Osan, south of the South Korean capital of Seoul, and ordered to fight as a rearguard to delay advancing North Korean forces while additional U.S. troops arrived in the country to form a stronger defensive line to the south. The task force lacked both anti-tank guns and effective infantry anti-tank weapons, having been equipped with obsolescent 2.36 in. rocket launchers and a few 75 mm recoilless rifles. Aside from a limited number of HEAT shells for the unit's 105 mm howitzers, crew-served weapons capable of defeating the T-34-85 Soviet tank had not been distributed to U.S. Army forces in Korea. A North Korean tank column equipped with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran the task force in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the North Korean tank column had breached U.S. lines the task force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up their advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and the remnants of the task force retreated in disorder.  Background  = Outbreak of war = On the night of June 25, 1950, ten divisions of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000 men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Armed Forces by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000 South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. The North Koreans had captured South Korea's capital of Seoul by June 28, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south. To prevent South Korea's collapse the United Nations Security Council voted to send military forces. The United States' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77, led by the fleet carrier USS Valley Forge; the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships, including HMS Triumph, to provide air and naval support. Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces, these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance. U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support. The strength of U.S. forces in the Far East, however, had steadily declined since the end of World War II five years earlier and the closest unit was the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, headquartered in Japan. Cuts in U.S. military spending meant the division was under strength and using outdated equipment. Division commander, Major General William F. Dean, determined that the 21st Infantry Regiment was the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments. Dean decided to send the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion from the formation because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bradford Smith, was the most experienced leading man, having fought at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft airlifted one battalion from the division garrison under Smith's command into Korea. The battalion deployed quickly to block advancing North Korean forces, performing a holding action while the rest of the division could be moved to South Korea by sea. = Task Force Smith = Task Force Smith arrives in South Korea The first units of the 24th Infantry Division left Itazuke Air Base in Japan on June 30. Task Force Smith, named for its commander, consisted of 406 men of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, as well as 134 men of A Battery, 52nd Field Artillery Battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Miller O. Perry. The forces were both poorly equipped and understrength: 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry had only two companies of infantry (B and C companies), instead of the regulation three for a U.S. Army battalion. The battalion had half of the required number of troops in its headquarters company, half of a communications platoon, and half of a heavy weapons platoon, which was armed with six obsolescent M9A1 Bazooka rocket launchers, two 75 mm recoilless rifles, two 4.2 inch mortars, and four 60 mm mortars. Much of this equipment was drawn from the rest of the understrength 21st. A Battery, which formed the entire artillery support for the task force, was armed with six 105 mm howitzers. These howitzers were equipped with 1,200 high explosive (HE) rounds, but these were incapable of penetrating tank armor. Only six high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds were issued to the battery, with all of them allocated to the number six howitzer sited forward of the main battery emplacement. A Battery also had four .50 calibre M2 Browning heavy machine guns and four bazookas. Most of the soldiers of the task force were teenagers with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training. Only one third of the officers in the task force had combat experience from World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience. Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations. By July 1, Task Force Smith had fully arrived in South Korea and briefly established a headquarters in Taejon. The task force soon after began moving north by rail and truck to oppose the North Korean army. Task Force Smith was the first of several small U.S. units sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of North Korean advances,Gal Perl Finkel, President-elect Trump ‚Äì the ‚ÄòWest Wing‚Äô lesson, The Jerusalem Post, November 15, 2016. delaying much larger North Korean units with the goal of buying time to allow more U.S. units into Korea. Task Force Smith's mission was to move as far north as possible and begin engaging the North Koreans to stem their advance so that the rest of the 24th Infantry Division could be moved into South Korea to reinforce it. The 24th Division commander, William F. Dean, personally ordered Smith to stop the North Korean force along the highway from Suwon and \\"as far from Pusan\\" as possible. Three days later, on July 4, it dug in on two hills straddling the road north of the village of Osan, south of Suwon and about south of Seoul. These ridges rose up to above the road, providing visibility almost the entire distance to Suwon. The battalion set up a long line over these ridges. There they waited to meet the advancing North Korean forces. The force was placed along the road with the infantry formations on the two hills, five of the howitzers sited behind the infantry, and the sixth with its six HEAT shells positioned halfway between the infantry and the other five field artillery pieces. Heavy rain made air support impossible so Smith and Perry preregistered the artillery battery in the hope it would be just as effective. The heavy machine guns and bazookas of A Battery along with a volunteer crew were sent forward to reinforce the infantry.  Battle  = Tank columns = At around 0730 on July 5, Task Force Smith spotted a column of eight North Korean T-34/85 tanks of the 107th Tank Regiment, North Korean 105th Armored Division heading south toward them. The North Korean forces, driving south from Seoul, were in pursuit of retreating South Korean forces. At 08:16 the artillery battery fired its first rounds at the advancing North Korean tanks. The tanks, which were around from the infantry force, were hit with numerous 105 mm howitzer rounds, but were unaffected. When the tanks closed to the 75 mm recoilless rifles fired, scoring direct hits on the lead tanks but did not damage them. The North Korean tanks returned fire, but they were unable to locate the American positions and gun emplacements, and their fire was ineffective. The T-34 tank was standard armor used by the North Korean Army in 1950 and was also present at Osan Once the tanks reached the infantry line Second Lieutenant Ollie Connor fired 22 2.36-inch rockets at a range of from his M9A1 launcher tube. Some of these rockets failed to ignite. The remainder did and several struck the rear plate armor of several T-34s, where their armor was thinnest. The warheads failed to penetrate the armor, however, and the North Korean tanks continued their advance, ignoring the roadblock and continuing down the road. The operators assumed the roadblock was manned by South Korean troops, and ignored it since it did not pose them a serious threat. When the tank column came over the crest of the road, the forward howitzer, commanded by Corporal Herman V. Critchfield, chief of section and crewed by five cannoneers, fired its HEAT rounds, damaging the first two tanks and setting one of them on fire. One of the crew members of the burning tank emerged with a PPSh-41 and killed a member of an American machine gun crew before being killed himself; the American became the first casualty of Korean War ground combat. He was later identified, incorrectly, as Kenneth R. Shadrick. The howitzer, depleted of HEAT rounds, began firing high explosive rounds before being destroyed by the third T-34. The tanks then advanced, continuing to ignore the American howitzer and bazooka fire. U.S. forces managed to disable another North Korean T-34 when a 105 mm shell struck and damaged its tracks. The tracks of the T-34 tanks cut communication signal wires between the infantry and artillery forces, further compounding the confusion. Perry was wounded in the leg by North Korean small arms fire as he was attempting to get the crew of the disabled tank to surrender. His artillery force continued firing at the North Korean tanks without effect. A second column of 25 T-34 tanks approached the task force within an hour. This second T-34 formation advanced singly or by twos, and threes, close together with no apparent formal organization. The howitzer battery hit another tank from this column in its tracks, disabling it, and damaged three more. The North Korean tanks had destroyed the forward howitzer (number six) and wounded one of its crew members, had killed or wounded an estimated twenty infantrymen, and had destroyed all the parked vehicles behind the infantry line. At the main battery position one of the five remaining 105 mm guns had been slightly damaged by a near-hit. Several of the men in the artillery battery began deserting their positions but Perry managed to convince most of them to return. Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age, the ineffectiveness of the 2.36-inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor. Because of peacetime defense cutbacks the 24th Infantry Division had never received improved U.S. M20 3.5-inch bazookas with M28A2 HEAT antitank ammunition, capable of defeating Soviet tanks. After the last tanks passed their lines, no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour. = Infantry column = Map of the Battle of Osan Three more tanks were sighted advancing from the north at around 11:00. Behind them was a column of trucks long, carrying two full infantry regiments; the 16th Infantry Regiment and the 18th Infantry Regiment of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, amounting to almost 5,000 troops under the command of Major General Lee Kwon Mu, which were advancing from Seoul. The column apparently was not in communication with the tanks that had preceded it, and the North Korean infantry was not aware of the Americans' presence. At 11:45, when the column had advanced to within of the Americans, Smith gave the order for the task force to open fire with everything it had. The mortar, machine gun, artillery, and rifle fire destroyed several trucks, scattering the column. The three lead tanks moved to within of Task Force Smith and opened fire. Behind them, around 1,000 of the infantry formed in the rice paddies to the east of the road in an attempt to envelop the American forces but were repulsed. Smith attempted to order artillery fire on the North Korean force but runners were unable to get back to the field artillery positions, and so he assumed they had been destroyed by the tanks. Within 45 minutes another enveloping force formed to the west of the road, forcing Smith to withdraw a platoon to the east side of the road. Quickly thereafter the American infantry began taking mortar and artillery fire from the North Koreans. = American withdrawal = Task Force Smith managed to hold its lines for three hours, but at 14:30 Smith ordered the Americans to withdraw, suffering from low ammunition and a breakdown of communications. At this point North Korean forces were moving on both flanks of the American force and toward the rear of the formation. Smith ordered an orderly withdrawal of the force one unit at a time, allowing the rest of the force to cover it as it withdrew. C Company pulled back, followed by the American medics, the headquarters, and finally B Company. 2nd Platoon, B Company, however, did not receive the withdrawal order. When the platoon discovered that it was alone, it was too late for an orderly withdrawal and it could not move its wounded quickly enough. The platoon left most of its equipment in its positions, which was captured by the North Koreans. Most of the survivors were able to escape captivity but a number of wounded litter- borne U.S. soldiers were left behind along with an attending medic. The American wounded were later found shot to death in their litters; the medic was never seen again. One North Korean officer later told historian John Toland that the American forces at the battle seemed \\"too frightened to fight\\". alt=A soldier's body lying on the ground with his hands tied behind his back. Picture taken July 10, 1950. The retreat quickly broke down into a confused and disorganized rout. Task Force Smith suffered its highest casualties during this withdrawal as its soldiers were most exposed to enemy fire. The surviving members of Task Force Smith reached Battery A's position. The artillerymen disabled the five remaining howitzers by removing their sights and breechblocks and retired in good order with the remains of the task force on foot to the northern outskirts of Osan, where most of the unit's hidden transport vehicles were found intact. The vehicles, unmolested by the North Korean forces, departed for Pyongtaek and Cheonan, picking up stragglers along the way, eventually joining units of the 24th Infantry Division that had established a second line of defense. Two-hundred fifty of Task Force Smith's force had returned to the American lines before nightfall, with about 150 more of the force killed, wounded or missing. Most of the other stragglers found their way into the American lines over the next several days. The last stragglers from 2nd Platoon, B Company, reached Chonan five days later, only 30 minutes ahead of the North Korean army. Upon the initial count, Task Force Smith suffered 20 killed in action, 130 wounded in action or missing in action, and around 36 captured. After the end of the war this figure was revised to 60 dead, 21 wounded and 82 captured, 32 of whom died in captivity. This casualty count accounted for 40 percent of Task Force Smith. U.S. troops advancing northward during the Pusan breakout offensive would later discover a series of shallow graves containing the bodies of several soldiers of the 24th Infantry Division. All had been shot in the back of the head, their hands bound behind their backs with communications wire. North Korean casualties were approximately 42 dead and 85 wounded, with four tanks destroyed or immobilized. The North Korean advance was delayed approximately seven hours.  Aftermath  South Korean sailors in formation in front of the Task Force Smith memorial at Osan The Battle of Osan was the first U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and unprepared for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops‚Äîthough the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly had a profound effect on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back. Though the force was badly defeated Task Force Smith accomplished its mission of delaying North Korean forces from advancing for several hours. During the battle the 24th Infantry Division's 34th Infantry Regiment was able to set up in Pyeongtaek, to the south. It would be similarly defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek. Over the next month the 24th Infantry Division would fight in numerous engagements to delay North Korean forces with similar results. Within a week, the 24th Infantry Division had been pushed back to Taejon where it was again defeated in the Battle of Taejon. The North Koreans, overwhelming U.S. forces time and again, were able to push the Eighth Army all the way back to Pusan, where the Battle of the Pusan Perimeter would culminate in the eventual defeat of the North Korean Army. Three months later, on September 19, Osan would be the location where the U.S. and U.N. forces under the command of the Eighth Army, advancing from the south, would meet up with forces of X Corps, advancing from the north after having recently surprised the North Koreans with the Inchon Landings, as the two forces were in an offensive pushing the North Koreans back, which would culminate in a complete defeat of the North Korean Army in the south. In the years following the Korean War the U.S. Army used the areas in Japan where Task Force Smith had trained as a memorial. A monument to Task Force Smith was also established on the Osan battlefield, where an annual commemoration of the Battle of Osan is held by the Eighth Army, which is still headquartered in South Korea.

Deutsches B√ºhnen-Jahrbuch: Theatergeschichtliches Jahr- und Adressenbuch, 1920, p. 255 After his emigration to the United States in 1924, his acting career blossomed. Befriending playwright George S. Kaufman and theater critic Alexander Woollcott, he enjoyed success in many Broadway productions. His Broadway credits included Once There Was a Russian (1961), Lily of the Valley (1942), Eight Bells (1933), Alien Corn (1933), Grand Hotel (1930), Half Gods (1929), and The Channel Road (1929).  Film  Hortense Alden, Sam Jaffe and Sig Ruman in the original Broadway production of Grand Hotel (1930)Ruman made his film debut in Lucky Boy (1929). He became a comic foil of the Marx Brothers, appearing in A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races, and A Night in Casablanca. His German accent and large stature kept him busy during World War II, playing sinister Nazi characters in a series of wartime thrillers. During this period, he also appeared in several films by director Ernst Lubitsch, a fellow German √©migr√©, including Ninotchka (1939), portraying a Russian, and To Be or Not to Be (1942). He played the role of Professor Herman Von Reiter in Shining Victory (1941), an adaptation of an A. J. Cronin play. Ruman continued his trend of portraying over-the-top German characters later in his career for Lubitsch's protege Billy Wilder, in his films The Emperor Waltz (1948), Stalag 17 (1953), One, Two, Three (1961), and in a cameo in The Fortune Cookie (1966). Around 1936, Ruman modified his screen name from Siegfried Rumann to Sig Ruman in an attempt to make it a little less German-sounding, as anti- German prejudice was rising at that time, just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. Despite declining health during the 1950s and 1960s, Ruman continued to appear in films and made many guest appearances on television.  Death  Ruman died of a heart attack on February 14, 1967, at his home in Julian, California. He was 82 and was survived by his wife Else and their daughter Senta.

It was a medium- sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, estimated at with a body shape similar to its much larger advanced relative, Tyrannosaurus. Alectrosaurus was a very fast running tyrannosauroid as indicated by the elongated hindlimbs that likely filled the niche of a pursuit predator, a trait that seems to be lost by the advanced and robust tyrannosaurids. Discovery and naming Excavation of the right hindlimb of A. olseni specimen AMNH 6554, in 1923. George Olsen on the right In 1923, the Third Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by chief paleontologist Walter W. Granger was hunting for dinosaur fossils in Mongolia. On April 25, assistant paleontologist George Olsen excavated and recovered the holotype AMNH 6554, a nearly complete right hindlimb. This included a virtually complete right hindlimb with some elements from the left pes and two manual unguals. On May 4, Olsen discovered another specimen approximately away from his first find, catalogued as AMNH 6368. This specimen included a right humerus, two incomplete manual digits, four fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other two or three unspecified elements that were discarded due to badly preservation. These discoveries were made at the Iren Dabasu Formation in what is now the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Nei Mongol Zizhiqu) of China. Both genus and species were formally described and named by the American paleontologist Charles Gilmore in 1933. The generic name, Alectrosaurus, can be translated as \\"alone lizard\\" or \\"mateless lizard\\", derived from the Greek words ·ºÑŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒøœÇ (meaning alone or unmarried) and œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ (meaning lizard). The specific name, olseni, is in honor of George Olsen, who discovered the first specimens. Skeletal reconstruction of AMNH 6554 Since then, more material has been referred to Alectrosaurus. Possible findings of two additional specimens at the Bayan Shireh Formation were reported and described by the Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle in 1977. The specimen IGM 100/50 consists of a partial maxilla, scapulocoracoid and manual ungual, and specimen IGM 100/51 compromises a fragmentary skull with lower jaws and other elements, incomplete ilium, and metatarsals of the right foot. These fossils were found in Outer Mongolia. Iren Dabasu and Bayan Shireh dinosaur faunas are very similar, so it is not surprising that a species of Alectrosaurus would be found there. Furthermore, several partial skeletons found in both Inner and Outer Mongolia might belong to Alectrosaurus. Alexander Averianov and Hans-Dieter Sues 2012 have estimated that the Iren Dabasu Formation is Santonian in age, correlating the Upper Bayan Shireh Formation. Van Itterbeeck et al. 2005 suggested that the Iren Dabasu Formation is probably Campanian-Maastrichtian in age and possibly correlated with the Nemegt Formation. Near the holotype, the specimen AMNH 6556 was found in the same strata but at different points also in 1923. It consists of premaxillary and lateral teeth, incomplete left lacrimal, maxillary process of the left jugal, partial right quadratojugal, jugal process of the right ectopterygoid and the quadrate ramus to the right pterygoid. Although the specimen seems to represent a smaller individual. Its affinity to Alectrosaurus is somewhat unresolved since the specimen lacks hindlimb material, making direct comparisons with Alectrosaurus quite complicated. Description Life restoration, based on the holotype specimen The lectotype AMNH 6554 is fragmentary, consisting of a nearly complete right hindlimb only lacking the distal tarsal elements; left metatarsals II, III and IV, and a fragmentary distal foot of a pubis, however it is unknown which pubis represents. It was a medium-sized tyrannosauroid, reaching a length between , and a weight ranging from . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Overall, the hindlimbs were rather gracile, in contrast to the robust tyrannosaurids. The length of its tibia (shinbone) and femur (thighbone) are very close, in contrast to the majority of other tyrannosauroids, where the tibia is longer. The femur measures and the tibia . The metetarsals are also closer in size to the tibia than in most other tyrannosauroids, where they are usually longer; the third is the largest, measuring long. The astragalus and calcaneum are nicely preserved, although the astragalus seems to be slightly damaged. They are strongly attached, but not fused. =Distinguishing anatomical features= Following the original description of Alectrosaurus, it can be distinguished by the following traits: long slender-limbed type of tyrannosauroid; humerus long and slender; ungual and phalanx of digit I robust, laterally compressed and strongly curved; femur and tibia subequal in length; length of astragalus onefourth the combined length of astragalus and tibia. According to Carr 2005, Alectrosaurus can be distinguished based on unique traits present in the hindlimbs, such as the spike-like process extending from the caudodorsal surface of the medial condyle of the femur, the presence of an abrupt expansion in length of the anterior margin of the joint surface for the tibia on the fibula, tendon pit adjacent to the ventrolateral buttress of the astragalus undercutting the medial surface of the buttress, the dorsal margin of the proximal surface of pedal phalanx II-2 is pointed, reduced pedal digit III, the lateral condyle of pedal phalanx III-1 is significantly deeper than the medial condyle, when in distal view, stocky pedal phalanx IV-2, when examined in proximal view, the dorsal half of the joint surface for metatarsal IV on metatarsal III is dilated anteriorly, and many others. Classification Ungual and phalanx of AMNH 6368 that were later confirmed to pertain to some therizinosaur and not Alectrosaurus In 1933, Charles Gilmore examined the available material and concluded that AMNH 6554 and AMNH 6368 were syntypes belonging to the same genus. He based this on his observation that the manual unguals from both specimens were morphologically similar. Observing similarities with the hindlimbs of specimen AMNH 5664 Gorgosaurus sternbergi, he classified this new genus as a \\"Deinodont\\", a term that is now considered equivalent to tyrannosaurid. Due to its fragmentary nature, there is presently very little confidence in restoring its relationships with other tyrannosauroids and many recent cladistic analyses have omitted it altogether. One study recovered Alectrosaurus at no less than eight equally parsimonious positions in a tyrannosauroid cladogram. Some paleontologists have equivocally considered Alectrosaurus olseni to be a species of Albertosaurus. Right humerus of excluded AMNH 6368 Alectrosaurus was originally characterized as a long-armed theropod, but Perle 1977 and Mader & Bradley 1989 observed that the forelimbs of the specimen AMNH 6368 did not belong to the genus, as they do not share characteristics with Tyrannosauroidea, and assigned them to the Therizinosauria incertae sedis. The remaining material, AMNH 6554 represents the hind limb with characteristics of a true tyrannosauroid, and were assigned as the lectotype for Alectrosaurus olseni. Additionally, four small caudal vertebrae were associated with the specimen AMNH 6368, the vertebrae were not included in the original description. Nevertheless, in 1984 they were catalogued as AMNH 21784. Mader and Bradley described these vertebrae, and were provisionally identified as caudal vertebrae of a small theropod dinosaur that is not phylogenetically referable to either the Tyrannosauroidea or Therizinosauridae as they show resemblance to the caudal vertebrae of Deinonychus and Plateosaurus. The Bayan Shireh material may or may not belong to this genus, and needs further study. One cladistic analysis showed that the two sets of specimens group together exclusive of any other taxa, so they are probably at least closely related, if not the same species. In 2018, Rafael Delcourt and Orlando Nelson Grillo published an extensive phylogenetic analysis of the Tyrannosauroidea, classifying Gondwanan and Laurasian tyrannosaurs. Below is the cladogram showing the phylogenetic position of Alectrosaurus according to their analysis: Palaeobiology Life restoration of the head The hindlimb of the specimen AMNH 6554 is notable for the particular elongated digits and metatarsals, differing from other tyrannosauroids. These traits are found in terrestrial runner birds, suggesting that Alectrosaurus was suited as a fast-running tyrannosauroid dinosaur with well developed hindlimbs; probably a pursuit predator. This interpretation is consistent with the results obtained in the limb proportion analysis performed by Scott Persons IV and Currie in 2016. By comparing the limbs of numerous theropods they noted that most tyrannosauroids were highly cursorial and leggy animals, with the exception of giant and stocky-legged forms such as Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus. Alectrosaurus was recovered with a relatively high CLP (Cursorial-limb-proportion) score at 16.5, higher than most carnosaurs. In 2001, a study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and colleagues, examined 23 foot bones referred to Alectrosaurus for signs of stress fractures, but none were found. Paleoecology Gigantoraptors protecting their nest from two Archaeornithomimus and an Alectrosaurusalt= Alectrosaurus was first recovered from the Iren Dabasu Formation, which has been dated to the Cenomanian stage, about 95.8 ¬± 6.2 million years ago. During the Late Cretaceous, there was a large floodplain with braided fluvial environments in the formation. The floodplain environments had extensive vegetation, evidenced in the palaeosol development and the numerous herbivorous dinosaurs that were found in both the river channel and the floodplain sediments. Contemporaneous paleofauna from this formation included another theropods such as Archaeornithomimus, Caenagnathasia, Erliansaurus, Gigantoraptor and Neimongosaurus; the sauropod Sonidosaurus and the two hadrosauroids Bactrosaurus and Gilmoreosaurus. Alectrosaurus likely preyed on these two. Additional to this, a potential discovery was made on the Bayan Shireh Formation at the Bayshi Tsav locality. The Bayan Shireh Formation is estimated to be Late Cretaceous in age, during the Cenomanian-Santonian stages, about 95.9 ¬± 6.0 million to 89.6 ¬± 4.0 million years ago, similar to Iren Dabasu. Here, Alectrosaurus lived alongside diverse theropods such as Achillobator, Garudimimus or Segnosaurus. Ankylosaurs were represented by Talarurus and Tsagantegia, other herbivorous dinosaurs include Graciliceratops, Gobihadros and Erketu. Alexander Averianov and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2012 estimated that the Upper Bayan Shireh correlated the Iren Dabasu Formation and both had similar environments. This correlation seems to be supported by a large number of ostracods reported in these formations. Further support can be evidenced on the similarities between the dinosaur taxa. As previously mentioned, Alectrosaurus appears to occur in both Iren Dabasu and Bayan Shireh Formations, although this referral to the genus has not been fully confirmed, the tentative specimens show striking resemblance to the Iren Dabasu material. In 2015, a giant caenagnathid was reported from the Bayan Shireh Formation, preserving a partial lower rostrum (beak) that is extremely similar to that of Gigantotaptor. If confirmed by future studies, this represents the first documented occurrence of a taxon in both formations.

Brahmvidya is the knowledge and spiritual knowledge of divine faith/God/existence. Put together, it means knowledge of the mantra/absolute. Brahmavidya is considered to be the highest ideal of classical. Brahmvidya does not pertain to hinduism, many other faiths practice and learn brahmvidya through different means, the Sikhs practice and learn brahmvidya through their Guru, the eternal Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Each faith teaches about the divine through different studies, yet the brahmvidya is one and the same - Truth itself. In the Puranas, this is divided into two branches, the first one dealing with the vedic mantras and is called para vidya or former knowledge, and the latter dealing with the study of the upanishads and is called the apara vidya or latter knowledge. Both para and apara vidya constitute brahma vidya. Etymology Brahma - The word Brahma is used in modern Hinduism to refer to the name of the Hindu Creator god who is a part of the Hindu trinity, but in relation to Brahmavidya, Brahma is referring to the ultimate reality called Brahman. For more information see Brahman. In the context of traditional Vedic study, Brahma holds two meanings. In the P≈´rva Mimamsa philosophy, which is based on a study of the samhita and brahmana sections of the vedas, the word brahma refers to the vedic mantras. In the uttara Mimamsa i.e. Vedanta philosophy, which is based on a study of the Aranyaka and the Upanishad sections of the vedas, the word Brahma means the absolute universal reality called Brahman. Vidya - The word vidyƒÅ (‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) means \\"knowledge,\\"Macdonell's Sanskrit Lexicon definition is \\"knowledge, learning, science\\" and is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root -vid- (\\"to know\\"), also seen in the word Veda.

At the same time, the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, due to move north along the Corps' left boundary as far as Chip‚Äôyong-ni, east of Yangp‚Äôyong, could protect the right flank of IX Corps as Operation Thunderbolt continued. In the recent course of protecting IX Corps' right, a joint motorized patrol from the 2nd and 24th Infantry Divisions on 29 January had moved north out of the Yoju area on the east side of the Han River to a pair of railroad tunnels and a connecting bridge standing east and west athwart a narrow valley south of Chip‚Äôyong-ni. PVA in the high ground overlooking the tunnels quickly cut the patrol's route of withdrawal, forced the group into hasty defenses on the nearest rises of ground, and opened a series of assaults. The PVA finally backed away after air strikes were called in by the pilot of an observation plane who spotted the ambush and after a motorized company of infantry reinforced the group about 03:30 on the 30th. The waylaid patrol had suffered five dead, twenty-nine wounded, and five missing out of a total strength of forty-five. At the discovery of PVA at the twin tunnels General Almond ordered the 2nd Division to identify and destroy all enemy units in that area. The 23rd Infantry Regiment received the assignment. On 31 January Regimental Colonel Paul L. Freeman Jr. sent his 3rd Battalion and the attached French Battalion to the tunnels after placing the 37th Field Artillery Battalion within a thousand yards of the tunnel area in direct support. The infantry battalions reached and established a perimeter around the tunnel-bridge complex without sighting enemy forces. But from farther north Colonel Freeman's forces themselves were observed by the PVA 125th Division, 42nd Army. Battle Near dawn on 1 February the 375th and 374th Regiments attacked from the north and northeast, respectively, and after daylight the 373rd Regiment assaulted the perimeter from the northwest and southwest. In hard, close-in fighting lasting all day, the defending battalions, relying heavily on artillery fire and on more than eighty air strikes finally forced the PVA to withdraw. Freeman's forces counted 1,300 enemy bodies outside their perimeter and estimated total PVA casualties at 3,600. Their own losses were 45 killed, 207 wounded, and 4 missing. Aftermath Judging from the two sharp actions at the twin tunnels, the PVA appeared determined to retain control of Chip‚Äôyong-ni. They had good reason. The town was so situated that the force occupying it could control movements over Route 2 to the west, over Route 24 to the northeast, over Routes 24 and 24A below town, and thus through the Yangp‚Äôyong-Ch'ungju segment of the Han River valley stretching to the southeast behind it. Eighth Army possession of Chip‚Äôyong-ni, furthermore, would pose a threat of envelopment to enemy forces opposing I and IX Corps below the Han River. For these same reasons General Almond planned to seize Chip‚Äôyong-ni and incorporated this plan in his overall recommendations for an operation styled on Operation Thunderbolt. Also behind Almond's proposals were late January intelligence reports of a strong enemy force assembling around Hongcheon, at the intersection of Routes 24 and 29 northeast of Chip‚Äôyong-ni and north of Hoengsong. This force, apparently part of the KPA V Corps, could be preparing to advance southwest on Route 24 through Chip‚Äôyongni, then down the Han valley toward Yoju and Ch‚Äôungju. Or the V Corps might again push forces south on Route 29 through Hoengsong toward Wonju. To spoil either move, Almond considered Hongcheon the proper main objective of a X Corps attack. To disrupt both the KPA V Corps and II Corps, he outlined a coordinated X Corps-ROK III Corps advance, Operation Roundup.

From 1958 to 1977 she was a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet where she performed in the world premieres of several works created specifically for her by choreographers George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins.

Early life in Europe Born in Pont-l'Abb√©, a seacoast town in the Finist√®re department of Brittany, in northwestern France, she was christened Nelly Armande Guillerm by her parents.Dominique Delouche et Florence Poudru, Violette Verdy (Pantin, France: Centre National de la Danse, 2008). A biography, in French. Her father, Renan Guillerm, died when she was a few months old; her mother, Jeanne Chateaureynaud, a schoolteacher, enrolled her daughter in dance lessons because she seemed to have so much energy. Considered a prodigy, she began her ballet training at the age of eight, in 1942, during the German occupation of northern France, and moved with her mother (who sought the best possible teachers for her daughter) to Paris at the height of the German occupation. Following studies in Paris with Carlotta Zambelli and later with Madame Rousanne Sarkissian and Victor Gsovsky, she made her professional debut in 1945, in the corps de ballet of Roland Petit's Le Po√®te at the Th√©√¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt in Paris. Soon afterward, she became a member of Petit's Ballets des Champs-√âlys√©es, where she appeared in numerous small roles over the next few years.Victoria Huckenpahler, Ballerina: A Biography of Violette Verdy (New York: Audience Arts,1978). In 1949, Guillerm was chosen by German cinema director Ludwig Berger to star in his film Ballerina, released in Europe in 1950 and known in America as '.International Movie Database, Dream Ballerina. http://imdb.com. Retrieved 12 April 2015. Berger insisted she adopt a stage name, and Roland Petit suggested Violette Verdy, reminiscent of both a flower and the composer Giuseppe Verdi. Critical praise for her sincere acting and pure classical ballet technique won her contacts and contracts with several European ballet companies. She went on to dance with the reorganized Ballets des Champs-√âlys√©es, the Ballet de Marigny, and Les Ballets de Paris de Roland Petit. With the last-named troupe, she created the role of the heroine of Petit's Le Loup (The Wolf, 1953), set to the music of Henri Dutilleux, which proved to be a significant turning point in her development as an interpretive artist. Widely recognized for her musicality, precision, and wit, she would thereafter tour the United States with Les Ballets de Paris (1953) and London Festival Ballet (1954-1955), appearing in leading roles with the ballet company of Teatro alla Scala (1955-1956) in Milan and with Ballet Rambert (1957) in London. With La Scala Ballet she danced the title roles in full-length productions of Cinderella and Romeo and Juliet,Jacobs School of Music, news release, 3 February 2009. http://info.music.indiana.edu.new/page/print/9826.html.

Dancing in America A film made during the London Festival Ballet tour of America brought Verdy to the attention of Nora Kaye, a ballerina at American Ballet Theatre, and, in 1957, to an invitation to join that company. Verdy accepted the invitation and moved to New York City. With her new company she quickly charmed American audiences in such repertory works as Gala Performance and Offenbach in the Underworld, both created by Antony Tudor and both with a decidedly French flavor. She also gave brilliant performances in Theme and Variations, set to the final movement of Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3 by George Balanchine, and a dramatic interpretation of the title role in Miss Julie, based on the 1888 play by August Strindberg and choreographed by Birgit Cullberg in 1950.Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormack, No Fixed Points: Dance in the Twentieth Century (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2003), p. 287. When American Ballet Theater was temporarily disbanded in 1958, Verdy was the only member invited to join New York City Ballet. Eager to work with George Balanchine, she promptly joined the company where, with rare exceptions, she would spend the next twenty years of her performing career. Although her French training and her petite physique set her apart from most female dancers in the company, she seemed to have an instinctive understanding of Balanchine's choreographic aesthetic; her quip that she feared sticking out \\"like a French poodle among a troupe of borzois\\" was widely circulated, but any personal anxiety was quickly dispelled by her well-received performances. She was soon dancing major roles in the repertory, giving dazzling performances in Allegro Brillante, Apollo, Divertimento No. 15, Scotch Symphony, Stars and Stripes, and Theme and Variations, often partnered by Edward Villella, who equaled her vivacity and technical aplomb on stage. Recognizing her musicality and kinesthetic intelligence, Balanchine created numerous parts for her over the years, including leading roles in Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux (1960), The Figure in the Carpet (1960), Liebeslieder Walzer (1960), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1962), Emeralds (1967), Glinkaiana (1967), La Source (1968), Pulcinella (1972), and Sonatine (1973).The George Balanchine Foundation, Balanchine Catalogue, \\"Violette Verdy,\\" http://www.blanchine.org/balanchine. Retrieved 10 April 2015. Of all these roles, Verdy is perhaps most identified with Emeralds, the opening ballet of the triptych Jewels, and with Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Verdy, Violette,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). Partnered with Conrad Ludlow in both these works, she embodied the Romantic spirit of Faur√©'s music in the former and the charm and effervescent joy of Tchaikovsky's music in the latter. Since its premiere, Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux has been performed by many ballerinas in numerous international companies, but few have come close to the musicality, wit, and technical bravura of Verdy's original interpretation.Mary Ellen Hunt, \\"How It's Done: Scintillating Speed,\\" Pointe Magazine (February‚ÄìMarch 2013). A descriptive analysis of Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux, with commentary by Violette Verdy. http://pointemagazine.com. Retrieved 10 April 2015. Verdy was also favored by choreographer Jerome Robbins, who cast her in Dances at a Gathering (1969) and In the Night (1970), both set to piano music by Chopin. Her solo as 'the woman in green\\" in Dances at a Gathering, a showpiece of her extraordinary musicality set to a quick Chopin √©tude (op. 25, no.4),Deborah Jowitt, Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), p. 386). remains a challenge for ballerinas to this day. The choreography of In the Night, set to three Chopin nocturnes, allowed her to display the finest nuances of meaning in movement. Among other notable roles in Verdy's repertory was that of Creusa, the \\"other woman\\" in Birgit Cullberg's Medea, which entered the New York City Ballet repertory in 1958.Nancy Reynolds, Repertory in Review: 40 Years of the New York City Ballet (New York: Dial Press, 1977), p. 191. As a guest artist, she appeared frequently in performances at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and on tour. In productions mounted by England's Royal Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet, and the Boston Ballet, she danced the ballerina roles in such classic works as Giselle, Swan Lake, La Sylphide, The Sleeping Beauty, and Copp√©lia. From 1949 onward, she was also often seen dancing on French, British, Canadian, and American television.Jacobs School of Music, news release, 3 February 2009. Later life In the 1960s, Verdy was briefly married to the writer and filmmaker Colin Clark. Verdy left New York City Ballet in 1977 to become the first female artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet, an illustrious but notoriously bureaucratic organization.Walter Terry, \\"Violette Verdy: Can She Restore the Glory of the Paris Opera Ballet?\\" Dance Scrapbook, New York Times (30 January 1977). After three years there, a change in the French government administration led her to leave Paris and return to the United States in 1980.Francis Mason, \\"The Paris Opera: A Conversation with Violette Verdy.\\" Ballet Review 14 (Fall 1986), 23-30. She then became associate director and later sole artistic director of the Boston Ballet, a post she held until 1984. Thereafter, she was engaged to head the faculty of the ballet program at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University. Recognized as a gifted choreographer, Verdy mounted, after 1965, numerous works for American and European ballet companies. She was also internationally renowned as a teacher of ballet technique. In her classes and coaching sessions, she emphasized the joy of dancing over the rigors of routine, even as she maintained the purity of her technical instruction.Barbara Newman, Grace under Pressure: Dancing through Time (London: Dance Books, and New York: Proscenium Publishers, 2003). Among the companies with which she accepted guest teaching residencies were London's Royal Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet, the Australian Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Teatro alla Scala, the Stuttgart Ballett, the Hamburg Ballett, the Bayeriches Staatsballett in Munich, and the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow,Igor Youskevitch, Playbill, New York International Ballet Competition, Sunday Evening, June 26, 2005, Honoring Violette Verdy (New York: Lincoln Center, 2005). where she became the first foreign teacher invited since the 1917 Revolution. In 2008, the School of American Ballet announced that Verdy would serve as their first, and, initially, only, permanent guest teacher. Verdy died in Bloomington, Indiana on 8 February 2016, after a short illness. Honors and awards Numerous awards and honors were bestowed on Verdy, including a 1968 Dance Magazine Award, the 2003 Artistic Achievements Award from the School of American Ballet, the 2005 Grand Prix Gold Medal at the International Ballet Festival of Miami, and the 2007 Ir√®ne Lidova Lifetime Achievement Award by Ballet2000, an international dance magazine. She was given a Doctor of Humane Letters by Skidmore College (1972) and Doctor of Arts from both Goucher College (1987) and Boston Conservatory (1997). Two honors were bestowed by the French government. In 1973, during her performing career, she was named a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres; thirty-five years later, she was honored with the medal of Chevalier dans l'Ordre de la Legion d'Honneur, France's highest decoration, presented in 2008.Jacobs School of Music, new release, 3 February 2009.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Northampton, then a two-member constituency, in 1910. He was returned in 1918 when it was reduced to a single-member seat, his former Liberal co-member Hastings Lees-Smith having sought election elsewhere and joined the Labour Party. =Coalition government= He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food Control from 1919 to 1920 and then Minister of Food Control in 1920. After the Ministry of Food Control was abolished in April 1921, he was appointed Coalition Liberal Chief Whip (officially 'Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury') in succession to Frederick Guest. Guest had held the position during the 1918 seat negotiations with the Unionists. Unlike Guest, McCurdy was more concerned with strengthening the Liberals part in the Coalition and took a much tougher line with the Unionists. A junior Unionist whip Robert Sanders, wrote in his diary that McCurdy was \\"a particularly bad-mannered fellow...the reverse...of Guest\\". McCurdy favoured a general election in January 1922 and the formation of a Centre Party made up of Liberals, moderate Conservatives and moderate Labour MPs. In March 1922, McCurdy wrote to Lloyd George claiming that one hundred Unionist MPs would defect if a Centre Party was formed. Lloyd George, however, decided to stay with the Coalition. He left office with Lloyd George when the Unionists ended the coalition in October 1922. =Liberal reunion= After the coalition ended, McCurdy favoured Liberal reunion. He was influential in drawing up the Liberals' manifesto for the 1923 general election, moving it further in a free trade direction. However, he was not returned at that election. He died in November 1941, aged 71, a month before his former co-member for Northampton, Hastings Lees-Smith.

Founded in 1912 during the American country day school movement, the institution features lower, middle, and upper schools, serving roughly 290 students from Pre-Kindergarten through grade 12. . About Park =History= Originally located in downtown Buffalo, The Park School was founded in 1912 by a group of Buffalo parents seeking an alternative to already established pre-preparatory institutions in the area. The group consulted with John Dewey and observed one of his students, Mary Hammett Lewis of Columbia University, then an instructor at the prestigious Horace Mann School in New York City. Miss Lewis was invited to Buffalo to become the founding Headmistress. She later wrote a book, An Adventure with Children, describing her experiences at The Park School of Buffalo. As the student body grew, it was decided that an upper preparatory school should be added. Originally for girls, the upper school began accepting male students in the early 1930s, then offering the only private, co- educational experience in the Buffalo, NY area. =Campus= In 1920, Chauncey Hamlin, a prominent Buffalonian, President of the American Association of Museums and founder of the Buffalo Museum of Science, offered his estate to the Park School Board, which arranged for its purchase. The estate, in Snyder, featured a large mansion, farmhouse, barn, small forest, orchard and pond, and a stone house at the entrance. Two of the original buildings constructed in the late 19th century, and one historic building that was a part of the Underground Railroad in the early 19th century, are still used by the school. Hamlin Hall, the school's oldest building, in snow. The most notable of these buildings remains Hamlin Hall, where most of the Upper School classes are held. Additional buildings include Chapin Hall, Kimball Hall, Stone Hall, The Rich Family Activity Center, Helen Long Building, the Clement Gymnasium, Preston L. Wright Greenhouse, and a newly constructed dining hall, as well as a pool and tennis courts. In January 2016, it was announced that the School retained CannonDesign to serve as architect for the \\"Knopp-Hailpern Science Center,\\" the first new building constructed on campus in 11 years. The building which may be between 8,500 square feet and 10,000 square feet is named after the late Dr. Jacky Knopp and Dr. Raoul Hailpern, two math teachers and educators who worked not only at Park, but also at the University at Buffalo and Canisius College. The building is proposed to be nestled between Stone and Hamlin Halls just off of the ‚Äúcircle‚Äù in the middle of the 34-acre campus. Park indicated that they are within $416,000 of the $4 million goal to cover the center‚Äôs development and construction costs. Groundbreaking began in 2017. Academics and programs =Faculty= The current Interim Head of School and Principal is Lisa Conrad. Ms. Conrad is the first woman appointed to lead the Park School of Buffalo since Leslie Leland was appointed Headmistress in 1925. Mrs. Conrad, a New York State Certified teacher, holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in Adolescent Education (7-12) and a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Spanish Education, both from SUNY University at Buffalo. She most recently served as the Dean of our Middle School and has also held positions in our Admissions and Enrollment Department. The Park School of Buffalo Administration includes Director of Admissions Marnie Cerrato and Director of Athletics Marcus Hutchins. =Traditions= Students at the Park School of Buffalo continue to engage in a variety of school traditions, many of them as old as the school itself. A Thanksgiving Feast is held annually, during which students and faculty from all three schools (Lower, Middle and Upper) assemble in the refectory for a traditional dinner and accompanying festivities. The feast is traditionally prepared by the Upper School graduating class, and is often attended by parents, grandparents, and alumni. Country Fair, held each fall since the 1930s, is an old fashioned fair with games and food for families, including the favorite \\"lemons with peppermint sticks\\" sold by the senior class. Another notable though somewhat younger tradition is the Orange and Brown competition. Each newly admitted student is randomly assigned to a team representing one of the school's colors. The teams compete throughout the year, accruing points through a variety of athletic and academic events, with the annual winning color inscribed on a trophy. One of the competitions between the Orange and Brown teams compete in is Winter Carnival. For half a day the high school goes outside and they compete in different activities. The last activity is always a relay race, then there is a group hug between the whole high school. =School Hymn= The Park School Hymn, written in 1930, is traditionally sung at school gatherings and events. The lyrics are as follows: \\"Park School, we sing to thee, songs thou hast taught our eager youth. Hearts filled with love and loyalty, we give to follow in thy truth. We have striven at thy side, searched for heights at thy behest; there were no winds we did not ride, in seeking life in gallant quest. Park School, oh hear our song, born of joy and knowledge free. Fulfillment that we sought for so long, we ever attain-ed here in thee.\\" =Clubs and Student Organizations= The Upper School is notable for the degree to which the student body is involved in administrative and decision-making processes. There is an active Student Government organization, which annually elects a voting representative to the school's Board of Trustees.

A widespread species with a cosmopolitan distribution, it is a medium-sized puffball with a round fruit body tapering to a wide stalk, and dimensions of wide by tall. It is off-white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or \\"jewels\\", which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface. When mature it becomes brown, and a hole in the top opens to release spores in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops. Common puffball, releasing spores in a burst by compressing the body The puffball grows in fields, gardens, and along roadsides, as well as in grassy clearings in woods. It is edible when young and the internal flesh is completely white, although care must be taken to avoid confusion with immature fruit bodies of poisonous Amanita species. L. perlatum can usually be distinguished from other similar puffballs by differences in surface texture. Several chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of L. perlatum, including sterol derivatives, volatile compounds that give the puffball its flavor and odor, and the unusual amino acid lycoperdic acid. Extracts of the puffball have antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Taxonomy The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. Synonyms include Lycoperdon gemmatum (as described by August Batsch in 1783); the variety Lycoperdon gemmatum var. perlatum (published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1829); Lycoperdon bonordenii (George Edward Massee, 1887); and Lycoperdon perlatum var. bonordenii (A.C. Perdeck, 1950). L. perlatum is the type species of the genus Lycoperdon. Molecular analyses suggest a close phylogenetic relationship with L. marginatum. The specific epithet perlatum is Latin for \\"widespread\\". It is commonly known as the common puffball, the gem-studded puffball (or gemmed puffball), the warted puffball, or the devil's snuff-box; Samuel Frederick Gray called it the pearly puff-ball in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants. Because some indigenous peoples believed that the spores caused blindness, the puffball has some local names such as \\"blindman's bellows\\" and \\"no-eyes\\". Description The fruit body ranges in shape from pear-like with a flattened top, to nearly spherical, and reaches dimensions of wide by tall. It has a stem-like base. The outer surface of the fruit body (the exoperidium) is covered in short cone-shaped spines that are interspersed with granular warts. The spines, which are whitish, gray, or brown, can be easily rubbed off, and leave reticulate pock marks or scars after they are removed. The base of the puffball is thick, and has internal chambers. It is initially white, but turns yellow, olive, or brownish in age. The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed-off spines is less evident on the base. In maturity, the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away, revealing a pre-formed hole (ostiole) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the gleba, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature. The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in L. pyriforme using high-speed schlieren photography determined that raindrops of 1 mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100 cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores. Common puffbal (Lycoperdon perlatum The spores are spherical, thick-walled, covered with minute spines, and measure 3.5‚Äì4.5 Œºm in diameter. The capillitia (threadlike filaments in the gleba in which spores are embedded) are yellow-brown to brownish in color, lack septae, and measure 3‚Äì7.5 Œºm in diameter. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 7‚Äì9 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. The basidia bear four slender sterigmata of unequal length ranging from 5‚Äì10 Œºm long. The surface spines are made of chains of pseudoparenchymatous hyphae (resembling the parenchyma of higher plants), in which the individual hyphal cells are spherical to elliptical in shape, thick-walled (up to 1 Œºm), and measure 13‚Äì40 by 9‚Äì35 Œºm. These hyphae do not have clamp connections. Edibility Lycoperdon perlatum is considered to be a good edible mushroom when young, when the gleba is still homogeneous and white. They have been referred to as \\"poor man's sweetbread\\" due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs, or used in soups as a substitute for dumplings. As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil. The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. L. perlatum is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The fruit bodies are appealing to other animals as well: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) includes the puffball in their diet of non- truffle fungi, while the \\"puffball beetle\\" Caenocara subglobosum uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding. Nutritional analysis indicates that the puffballs are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and several micronutrients. The predominant fatty acids in the puffball are linoleic acid (37% of the total fatty acids), oleic acid (24%), palmitic acid (14.5%), and stearic acid (6.4%). The immature 'buttons' or 'eggs' of deadly Amanita species can be confused with puffballs. This can be avoided by slicing fruit bodies vertically and inspecting them for the internal developing structures of a mushroom, which would indicate the poisonous Amanita. Additionally, amanitas will generally not have \\"jewels\\" or a bumpy external surface. The spores are ornamented with many sharp microscopic spines and can cause severe irritation of the lung (lycoperdonosis) when inhaled. This condition has been reported to afflict dogs that play or run where puffballs are present. Similar species There are several other puffball species with which L. perlatum might be confused. L. nettyanum, found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, is covered in granular patches, but these granules adhere more strongly to the surface than those of L. perlatum. L. pyriforme lacks prominent spines on the surface, and grows on rotting wood‚Äîalthough if growing on buried wood, it may appear to be terrestrial. The widely distributed and common L. umbrinum has spines that do not leave scars when rubbed off, a gleba that varies in color from dark brown to purple-brown at maturity, and a purple-tinged base. The small and rare species L. muscorum grows in deep moss. L. peckii can be distinguished from L. pyriforme by the lavender-tinged spines it has when young. L. rimulatum has purplish spores, and an almost completely smooth exoperidium. L. excipuliforme is larger and grayer, and, in mature individuals, the upper portion of its fruit body breaks down completely to release its spores. In the field, L. marginatum is distinguished from L. perlatum by the way in which the spines are shed from the exoperidium in irregular sheets. Ecology and distribution Fruit bodies may grow singly, scattered, in groups, or‚Äîas shown here‚Äîin clusters. A saprobic species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in fairy rings. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It has been reported from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance. A widespread species with an almost cosmopolitan distribution, it has been reported from Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland, and subalpine regions in Iceland. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from Alaska to Mexico, although it is less common in Central America. The species is popular on postage stamps, and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden. The puffball bioaccumulates heavy metals present in the soil, and can be used as a bioindicator of soil pollution by heavy metals and selenium. In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead. L. perlatum biomass has been shown experimentally to remove mercury ions from aqueous solutions, and is being investigated for potential use as a low-cost, renewable, biosorptive material in the treatment of water and wastewater containing mercury. Chemistry Lycoperdic acid is an amino acid known only from L. perlatum. Several steroid derivatives have been isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L. perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol Œ±-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3Œ≤,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant components of the volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against laboratory cultures of the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with activity comparable to that of the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L. perlatum puffballs to contain cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14 milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin. The amino acid lycoperdic acid (chemical name 3-(5(S)-carboxy-2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5(S)-yl)-2(S)-alanine) was isolated from the puffball, and reported in a 1978 publication. Based on the structural similarity of the new amino acid with (S)-glutamic acid, (S)-(+)-lycoperdic acid is expected to have antagonistic or agonistic activity for the glutamate receptor in the mammalian central nervous system. Methods to synthesize the compounds were reported in 1992, 1995, and 2002.

As humans expanded into the cane rat's native habitats, the cane rats likewise expanded from their native reeds into the plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations from which they derive their name. Their tendency to adopt plantations as habitat, where they feed on agricultural crops such as maize, wheat, sugar-cane and cassava, often earns them the label of agricultural pest.

It is a simple pattern that can be observed in market price data, using traditional bar charts, point and figure charts, or Japanese candlestick charts. The pattern does not belong to the collection of traditional candlestick chart patterns. Though some have referred to the hikkake pattern as an \\"inside day false breakout\\" or a \\"fakey pattern\\", these are deviations from the original name given to the pattern by Daniel L. Chesler, CMT and are not popularly used to describe the pattern. For example, the name \\"hikkake pattern\\" has been chosen over \\"inside day false breakout\\" or \\"fakey pattern\\" by the majority of book authors who have covered the subject, including: \\"Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians\\" by Charles D. Kirkpatrick and Julie R. Dahlquist, and \\"Long/Short Market Dynamics: Trading Strategies for Today's Markets\\" by Clive M. Corcoran, and \\"Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader\\" by Peter L. Brandt.  Conceptual basis  The pattern consists of a measurable period of rest and volatility contraction in the market, followed by a relatively brief price move that encourages unsuspecting traders and investors to adopt a false assumption regarding the likely future direction of price. The pattern, once formed, yields its own set of trading parameters for the time and price of market entry, the dollar risk amount (i.e., where to place protective stops), and the expected profit target. The pattern is not meant as a stand alone \\"system\\" for market speculation, but rather as an ancillary technique to traditional technical and fundamental market analysis methods.  Description  The pattern is recognized in two variants, one bearish and one bullish. In both variants, the first bar of the pattern is an inside bar (i.e., one which has both a higher low and a lower high, compared with the previous bar). This is then followed by either a bar with both higher low and higher high for the bearish variant, or with lower low and lower high for the bullish variant. Before the pattern produces a trading signal it must be confirmed; this happens when the price passes below the low of the first bar of the pattern (in the bearish variant) or above the high of the first bar (in the bullish variant). Confirmation must occur within three periods of the last bar of the signal for the signal to be considered valid.  Origin  The hikkake pattern was first conceived and introduced to the financial community through a series of published articles written by technical analyst Daniel L. Chesler, CMT.Daniel L. Chesler, CMT The phrase \\"Hikkake\\" is a Japanese verb which means to \\"trick\\" or \\"ensnare.\\" Chesler chose the name \\"hikkake\\" after consulting with Yohey Arakawa, Associate Professor of Japanese, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies.  Institutional uses and peer recognition  The hikkake pattern has been adopted for use by IntStream Oy, a global data distributor of the Nordic electricity energy market Nord Pool, in their E2 energy market analysis platform designed for use by institutional traders. The hikkake pattern has also been chosen for inclusion among other foundational, technical analysis chart patterns comprising the Market Technicians Association Educational Foundation (MTAEF), College Level Introduction to Technical Analysis.

It was capable of co-firing biomass, natural gas and sludge. The station stands on the north bank of the Firth of Forth, near Kincardine on Forth. Its generating capacity of 2,400 megawatts was the highest of any power station in Scotland. The station began generating electricity in 1970, and when it became fully operational it was the largest coal-fired station in Europe. At the time of closure it was the third largest, after Be≈Çchat√≥w in Poland and Drax in England, and the 21st most polluting. Longannet was operated by the South of Scotland Electricity Board until 1990, when its operation was handed over to Scottish Power following privatisation. After failing to win a contract from National Grid, the station closed on 24 March 2016.Third Force News. Green groups welcome Longannet closure. 23 March 2015. The station is a regional landmark, dominating the Forth skyline with its chimney stack. Longannet lacked cooling towers, having instead used water from the River Forth for cooling. History The station was designed by Scottish architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall & Partners. Consulting Engineers were Merz and McLellan. Construction began in the mid-1960s, downstream of the existing Kincardine power station. The station was constructed on of land reclaimed from the Firth of Forth using ash from the Kincardine station. It began generating electricity in 1970, with a design lifetime of 30 years, and was in full operation by 1973. At the time of its completion, the station was the largest in Europe. The facility was operated by the South of Scotland Electricity Board until 1990 when the electricity industry in the UK was privatised. After that it was operated by Scottish Power, a subsidiary of Iberdrola. It paid ¬£40m per year in connection charges to National Grid due to its distance from South England. The plant opted in to the UK Transitional National Plan, placing limits on its sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides and particulates emissions. The plant tested additional technologies that could have permitted it to operate beyond 2020 under the EU Industrial Emissions Directive. The station closed on 24 March 2016. Design and specification Longannet had an installed capacity of 2400 MW and a declared net capacity of 2304 MW due to plant overheads. The station produced 9,525 GWh of electricity in 2012, an increase on the 9,139 GWh produced in 2011. =Electricity generation= alt= The station consumed up to of coal each year. Coal was delivered either by road or rail to the station's coal store, which had the capacity to hold up to 2,000,000 tonnes. It was then fed from the coal store to the boiler house by a conveyor belt capable of carrying 3500 tonnes of coal per hour. Each of the four boilers was serviced by eight pulverising units each capable of processing 40 tonnes of coal an hour. The front-wall-fired Foster Wheeler boilers could each burn around 250 tonnes of coal an hour at full load. There were two forced draft and two induced draft fans on each boiler. Each boiler provided around 1800 tonnes per hour of steam at a pressure of and a temperature of to two 300 MW General Electric Company turbo generators. The thermal efficiency of the plant was around 37%. =Coal supply= Coal was originally supplied directly by conveyor belt from the neighbouring Longannet Colliery, until it closed in 2002 after a flood. Around half of the coal used was Scottish, and the rest had to be imported, the majority via the former British Steel plc ore loading facility at Hunterston Terminal in Ayrshire. Onward transport was by rail and the level of traffic required to supply Longannet's fuel demand caused congestion on the Scottish rail network. An alternative route, the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link, at the mouth of the river Forth was reopened in 2008, and was also used to deliver coal. =Cooling system= The chimney is tall; the station did not have cooling towers, instead using water drawn from the Firth of Forth at a rate of per hour for the station's cooling condensers. The water was passed through coarse screens and then circulated by four electrically driven pumps. Once circulated through the station's condensers, the water was discharged into a mile long cooling channel, where heat was dissipated before the water reached a wide part of the Forth. Water used by the boilers was on a different cycle, and had to be deionised. Losses from this supply were made up by a plant capable of treating of water per hour. =Electrostatic precipitators and sulphur trioxide conditioning= The station was fitted with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to reduce the station's particulate emissions. In the late 1980s the station's units were fitted with sulphur trioxide (SO3) conditioning equipment to lower the fly ash's electrical resistivity. This was to ensure the station maintained allowable particulate emissions. Between 1989 and 1994, the station's ESPs were given a major refurbishment. This meant that the SO3 conditioning equipment did not need to be operated as frequently to maintain the allowed level of particulate emissions. This was beneficial as SO3 is hazardous. =NOx reduction= In 1994, the station was awarded funding from the European Commission under the THERMIE Demonstration Programme. With this money, Unit 2 at the station was retrofitted with gas-reburn equipment. This was the largest scale application of this technology in the world. In this process, natural gas is injected into the boiler. This cut NOx emissions from Unit 2 by 50%, as well as giving a reduction in CO2 and SO2 emissions. In 1996, all the station's boilers were fitted with Low NOx burners. This reduced the station's NOx emissions by 40%. The blend of coal fed to each unit was intended to minimize emissions of sulphur. =Carbon capture and storage= The UK's first carbon capture and storage (CCS) unit was commissioned at the station in 2009. It closed in 2011 after it became clear that it was not financially viable. Plans for a UK Government funded project to convert Longannet to CCS were abandoned in 2011 and no further plans for CCS at Longannet were announced. Environmental and health impact In 2003, Longannet was named as Scotland's biggest polluter in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). The station produced up to 4,350 tonnes of ash per day. This was piped to ash lagoons surrounding the nearby Preston Island. Gazetteer for Scotland - Preston Island This was then landscaped and used to reclaim the land from the Firth of Forth. To improve environmental emissions, Longannet was fitted with 'Low-NOx' burners to limit the formation of oxides of nitrogen and a 'gas reburn system' that used natural gas to convert NOx into nitrogen and water vapour. Longannet used to burn up to 65,000 tonnes of treated and dried sewage sludge per year, which has a similar calorific value to low-quality brown coal. In 2005, a judge ruled the burning of sludge as illegal, but the SEPA continued to allow Scottish Power to burn the sludge illegally as part of an agreement which originally required Scottish Power to construct, and have in operation, a biomass plant in 2010. All burning of biomass at Longannet ‚Äì including waste-derived fuel and sawdust pellets ‚Äì ceased in April 2012. In 2007, the WWF named Europe's 30 most climate polluting power stations in absolute terms; of these, Longannet was the most polluting in the UK (relative to power output). It was the 21st most polluting power station in Europe. According to a Greenpeace-commissioned report by Stuttgart University on the health impacts of the biggest coal- burning power plants in Europe, Longannet was responsible for 4,210 lost 'life years' in 2010.

Finished in 1865, it was the first building on the college's campus, older even than the Main Building, with which it shares the status of National Historic Landmark. The observatory's significance is due to its association with Maria Mitchell, the first widely known woman astronomer in the United States. As the college has built a new observatory on a hill near the edge of campus, the building is no longer used for astronomy. In 2008 it underwent a large restoration and renovation and now houses the offices of the Education Department and classrooms. History Maria Mitchell (seated) inside the dome of the Vassar College Observatory Mitchell, the first manager of the observatory, focused primarily on observing planets and their satellites. She was an avid advocate for using the observatory as part of courses of study. Students could frequently be found using both the main telescope and any number of smaller instruments. In addition to serving as an educational and research facility, the original observatory also served as a home for Maria and her father during and after her tenure as professor. Professor Mary W. Whitney assumed the directorship in 1888. She had been a student of Mitchell's. Whitney focused on comets and published in 1890, 1892 and 1895 in the Astronomical Journal. It was noted in Popular Astronomy in 1904, \\"In general the work done at Vassar is similar to that done at several of the smaller German and Italian Observatories.\\" The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Today, the old observatory is no longer used for research. While the building still stands, the telescope has been removed and most of the building is used as office space. In the late 1990s, a new observatory was built on the Vassar College campus. The Class of '51 Observatory houses two telescopes; one 20-inch reflector used primarily for public outreach, and a 32-inch reflector used for teaching and research. It is tied with the Austin-Fellows telescope of the Stull Observatory at Alfred University for being the 2nd-largest optical telescope in the state of New York, the largest being the 40-inch reflector at SUNY Oneonta College Observatory. =List of Directors= * Maria Mitchell (1865‚Äì1888) * Mary W.

Cooper was an assistant coach at Iowa State, Oregon State, UCLA, Kansas, and Kentucky. Then, he embarked on a head coaching career, as he served as the head coach at the University of Tulsa (1977‚Äì1984), Arizona State University (1985‚Äì1987), and Ohio State University (1988‚Äì2000), compiling a career record of 192‚Äì84‚Äì6. Cooper was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2008. Early years and playing career Cooper was born and raised in the Knoxville suburb of Powell, Tennessee. He graduated from Powell High School in 1955, then served in the United States Army for two years. After serving for two years, he enrolled at Iowa State University, where he played football for legendary coach Clay Stapleton in the single-wing formation with the Iowa State Cyclones, including the 1959 \\"Dirty 30\\" team. As a senior in 1961, Cooper was team captain and MVP. Cooper graduated from Iowa State in 1962 with a bachelor's degree in physical education. Coaching career Cooper began his coaching career in 1962 as the freshmen team coach at Iowa State. He then was an assistant coach at Oregon State from 1963 to 1964 under Tommy Prothro and helped Oregon State finish first place in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1964. Oregon State also made the Rose Bowl and finished #8 in the final AP Poll. Cooper then followed Prothro to UCLA to be an assistant there from 1965 to 1966. In the 1965 season, UCLA finished first in the AAWU and #4 in the final AP Poll and won the Rose Bowl. The 1966 UCLA team finished #5 in the AP Poll. In 1967, Cooper became defensive coordinator at Kansas under Pepper Rodgers. Cooper again was part of a conference championship team in 1968 when Kansas finished first in the Big 12. The 1968 Kansas team finished #9 in the final AP Poll and made the Orange Bowl. Cooper remained at Kansas until 1971. From 1972 to 1976, Cooper had his final assistant position at Kentucky, first under John Ray in 1972 then Fran Curci from 1973 to 1976. In Cooper's final season at Kentucky in 1976, Kentucky finished #18 in the AP Poll and won the Peach Bowl. In 1977, he was named the head football coach at the University of Tulsa. At Tulsa, he compiled a 56‚Äì32 record with five Missouri Valley Conference titles. Cooper considers his tenure at Tulsa his \\"most enjoyable years as a coach\\". He became the head coach at Arizona State in 1985 where his teams played in three consecutive bowl games, including the 1987 Rose Bowl, during his three-year tenure. Notably, he was just 0‚Äì2‚Äì1 against arch-rival Arizona. He accepted the job as head coach at Ohio State on December 31, 1987. Cooper's first season in Columbus was somewhat undistinguished; the Buckeyes notched their first losing season since 1966. However, he quickly turned the Buckeyes around and led them to shared Big Ten titles in 1993, 1996, and 1998. In his 13 seasons at Ohio State, Cooper compiled a 111‚Äì43‚Äì4 record; his 111 victories are second in Ohio State history behind only Woody Hayes's 205. Among his most memorable victories at Ohio State were back-to-back victories against Notre Dame (1995 and 1996), leading Ohio State to its first Rose Bowl in 13 years (the 1997 Rose Bowl‚Äîa win over Arizona State), and a 1999 Sugar Bowl victory over Texas A&M.; Cooper's teams at Ohio State were loaded with a great deal of talent that would go on to play in the NFL, including: 1995 Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George, 1995 Fred Biletnikoff Award winner Terry Glenn, 1996 Outland Trophy winner Orlando Pace, 1998 Jim Thorpe Award winner Antoine Winfield, as well as Alonzo Spellman, Robert Smith, Dan Wilkinson, Joey Galloway, Rickey Dudley, Mike Vrabel, Korey Stringer, David Boston, Shawn Springs, Ahmed Plummer, Na'il Diggs, Nate Clements, and Ryan Pickett. However, Cooper has also been remembered for his 3‚Äì8 bowl record and his 2‚Äì10‚Äì1 record against archrival Michigan. His most disappointing losses to the Wolverines came in 1993, 1995, and 1996. In each season of those seasons, Ohio State entered the Michigan game undefeated and ranked in the top five, but were upset by the Wolverines on each occasion; two of those losses cost the Buckeyes a Rose Bowl bid. In 1993 Ohio State was ranked #5 and undefeated, needing only to beat Michigan to get their first trip to Pasadena in nine years. However, they were shut out by the unranked Wolverines 28‚Äì0 in Ann Arbor. In 1995 Ohio State lost a #2 ranking, the Big Ten title, and another shot at the Rose Bowl by losing to the #18 ranked Wolverines, 31‚Äì23, in Ann Arbor. In 1996, the Buckeyes were again ranked #2 and had already secured a Rose Bowl berth when they faced #21 ranked Michigan, this time in Columbus. The Buckeyes smelled victory after shutting out the Wolverines in the first half, but Michigan rallied in the second half to upset the Buckeyes yet again, 13‚Äì9, costing them a chance at the national championship. Ohio State would go on to win the 1996 Rose Bowl against Arizona State and finish the season ranked #2. With this victory, Cooper became the first coach to win the Rose Bowl with a Pac-10 and a Big Ten team. In 1997, top ranked Michigan entered the game undefeated and #4 Ohio State had the opportunity to spoil Michigan's perfect season; however, the Wolverines again defeated the Buckeyes, 20‚Äì14. To add insult to injury, Michigan's win was highlighted by the performance of Ohio native and 1997 Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, who made game changing plays on offense, defense, and special teams. In 1998, Ohio State was 8‚Äì0 and ranked #1 in the country but was upset by Michigan State, 28‚Äì24. They did go on to beat Michigan that season and won the Sugar Bowl over Texas A&M;, 24-14, eventually finishing #2 in the polls. Cooper's Buckeyes were expected to have a strong season in 1999, but slumped to 6‚Äì6, their first non-winning record since Cooper's first year and only their third since 1947. They rebounded to 8‚Äì4 a year later, but a 38‚Äì26 loss to Michigan cost Cooper his job at the end of the season. He was the first non-interim Buckeye head coach since Wes Fesler, Hayes' predecessor, to have left Ohio State without winning an outright Big Ten title. Later life and honors Cooper currently works for the Cincinnati Bengals of the NFL as a scouting consultant and also works as a college football analyst for ESPN. On May 1, 2008, Cooper was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 30, 2012 representing both Arizona State and Ohio State football teams. On September 8, 2014, Cooper was inducted into the Iowa State University Athletics Hall of Fame in an on-field ceremony during the Iowa State-Kansas State football game.

Campus Menlo College is situated on 45-acre (0.18 km2) campus in Atherton, California, 25 miles southeast of San Francisco and 20 miles northwest of San Jose, California. History Menlo College was founded in 1927 when the Menlo School for Boys grew to include a junior college. The institution, under the leadership of Dr. Lowry Howard, changed its name to Menlo School and Junior College. The college admitted 27 students that year. Enrollment in the school and college rose to 112 the following year, with 80 of those students attending the college. The effects of the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent depression reached Menlo in 1931, and the institution faced the possibility of having to close its doors. Deliverance came in the form of two generous acts. First, Board Chairman C. F. Michaels made a series of substantial loans to Menlo to help sustain its operations. That same year, the Town of Atherton voted to deed a strip of land to Menlo, allowing the institution to expand its campus. The property was originally the site for a proposed new road, but the town decided that the new road would not be necessary. From the founding of the junior college through 1932, Howard and Michaels had been meeting with Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of Stanford University, to discuss the possibility of having Menlo serve as Stanford's lower division institution. The three developed a detailed plan wherein Stanford would drop its freshman and sophomore classes and Menlo would move its operations to the Stanford campus. The Stanford Board of Trustees reviewed the plans and turned down the proposal. Stanford would maintain its four-year undergraduate program. Wilbur remained interested in Menlo nonetheless, and in 1933, he appointed six members of the Stanford faculty to educational advisory roles at Menlo. The start of World War II brought to Menlo the challenge of reduced enrollment. To balance the student body, Howard instated a four-four plan wherein grades 7 through 10 were designated to the School while grades 11 through 14 constituted the College. As World War II was coming to an end in 1944, President Howard suffered severe heart trouble, and his physician advised that he retire from the presidency of Menlo. The Board of Trustees chose Dr. William E. Kratt, former college dean and soon-to-be Navy veteran, as Howard's successor. The former estate of the Leon F. Douglass family, which was adjacent to Menlo, housed a rehabilitation center for World War II veterans until 1946. The Douglass family supported Menlo in acquiring the newly vacant property, and plans were made to move the school (grades 7 to 10, and later, 11 and 12) to that area. The School of Business Administration (SBA) was established in 1949 as the college's first four-year program. This was a timely move, as Stanford had just dropped its undergraduate business courses to focus more on the Graduate School of Business. The institution again changed its name, this time to Menlo School and Menlo College. The founding of the SBA made Menlo School and Menlo College eligible for complete tax exemption as a four-year, nonprofit educational institution. The savings in taxes were put into expanding and polishing Menlo. In 1953 the institution purchased property across the street from the campus to move the track and athletic fields to their current home. 1954 saw the development of two new dormitories for Menlo: Howard Hall and Michaels Hall, named after Dr. Lowry Howard and C. F. Michaels. In addition to student rooms, each building included four faculty apartments. John D. Russell became the director of the college in 1955. An SBA professor and World War II veteran, Russell used his experience as a legal scholar to focus his courses on the legal aspects of business, earning him the affectionate nickname ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù. He took deep interest in developing his students into business leaders and is considered by many to have epitomized the spirit of Menlo. That same year, the Hewlett-Packard Company donated seven houses in Mountain View to Menlo. The houses were moved to the Douglass campus and assigned to faculty members. In 1956 Florence Moore made a historic gift to Menlo in financing the construction of the Florence Moore Science and Engineering Building, housing math and science facilities as well as an auditorium. Construction of a new student union, post office and dormitory was completed in 1958, and Menlo opened a new dining commons in 1962. The old dining commons was converted to the Bowman Library. 1969 brought to Menlo a new building for the School of Business Administration and the two- year school that included classrooms, faculty and staff offices, a theater and a computer center. This building, now called Brawner Hall, holds most of the business courses at Menlo. That same year, Menlo completed construction of its largest college dormitory, holding 150 students. President William E. Kratt retired in 1970, and in 1971 the dormitory was dedicated to him. William E. Kratt Hall currently serves as the primary housing facility for freshman students. Richard F. O'Brien succeeded Kratt as President of Menlo. In the fall of 1971, Menlo became a co-educational institution and admitted its first female students. The institution initiated its first major fund-raising campaign in 1976. The ‚ÄúCampaign for Menlo‚Äù set a $5 million goal to cover the costs of new athletic facilities, expand the library's collection, acquire new instructional equipment and increase the school's endowment. James Waddell was the President of Menlo College from 1994 to 2004. The presidency was then given to Carlos L√≥pez, who held that seat until 2007. In 2007, Menlo College appointed Dr. G. Timothy Haight, former Dean of Business at California State University, Los Angeles, as its President. In 2008, Menlo College and Menlo School finalized plans to become completely separate institutions. These plans included a land separation agreement. Under the agreement, the single parcel shared by the College and School was subdivided into two separate parcels. A third parcel, the Menlo Athletic Fields, will still be jointly owned and managed. Menlo College received its largest gift to date, a $21.3 million bequest from the Hope Bartnett Belloc Trust, in 2008. Belloc named Menlo as one of three beneficiaries of the total trust amount‚Äîaround $60 million‚Äîin response to the college's mentorship of her son, Martin, during the 1962-63 academic year when he was a student. The other two recipients were United Cerebral Palsy North Bay in Petaluma, California and Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Gonzales, Neil (October 7, 2008). \\"University Receives $21M Gift\\".

Essentially a tenor lute with the theorbo's neck-extension, the archlute lacks the power in the tenor and the bass that the theorbo's large body and typically greater string length provide.  Overview  The main differences between the archlute and the \\"baroque\\" lute of northern Europe are that the baroque lute has 11 to 13 courses, while the archlute typically has 14, and the tuning of the first six courses of the baroque lute outlines a d-minor chord, while the archlute preserves the tuning of the Renaissance lute, with perfect fourths surrounding a third in the middle for the first six. The archlute was often used as a solo instrument for the first three-quarters of the 17th century, but is rarely mentioned as a continuo instrument in this period, the theorbo being the lute class instrument with this role. As continuo bass lines were composed both faster in motion and higher in tessitura towards the end of the 17th century, the archlute began to eclipse the theorbo as the main plucked string continuo instrument. The theorbo lacked the higher notes of the bass lines and the increasing practise of doubling the continuo part with a bowed bass (cello or viol) made the archlute's lack of power in the tenor and bass a less important shortcoming. The theorbo had been commonly used as the melodic bass instrument in trio sonatas from the beginning of the Baroque and the archlute took over that function too, with the most famous example being Corelli's Opus 1 and 3 trio sonatas which have partbooks for 1st and 2nd violin, 'violone o arciliuto' and a continuo part for organ, a simplified version of the 'violone o arciliuto' book. The violone o arciliuto book has just as many figures to tell the player what chords to play as the organ partbook, which suggests the archlute player would be adding chords above the bass where possible. The archlute was used in Handel's operas and like repertoire; Giulio Cesare (1724) has continuo parts labelled both arciliuto and tiorba. Perhaps one player would play both instruments. Music for solo archlute is usually notated in tablature. Composers Any late Italian Baroque music with a part labelled 'liuto' will mean 'arciliuto', the classic Renaissance lute being in disuse by this time. Among the most important composers of archlute music in the 17th century we can name Alessandro Piccinini, Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger (c. 1580 ‚Äì 17 January 1651) and in the 18th century Giovanni Zamboni, whose set of 12 sonatas (1718, Lucca) for the instrument is extant, and Antonio Scotti and Melchiorre Chiesa, Milanese composers from late 18th century. Other known composers of archlute music were Antonio Tinazzoli, Giuseppe Vaccari and Lodovico Fontanelli. Modern composers for archlute include Roman Turovsky and Konstantin Bozhinov. Performers Some living players are Edin Karamazov, Axel Wolf and Luca Pianca (the founder of Il Giardino Armonico), who predominantly play archlutes, and Paolo Cherici, Massimo Lonardi, Luciano Contini, Paul O'Dette, Jakob Lindberg and Nigel North, who use archlutes extensively.

He fought at many battles during the Napoleonic Wars. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington had the highest opinion of his abilities and made him the effective commander of his army's artillery during the latter part of the Peninsular War. Military career Dickson entered the Royal Military Academy in 1793, passing out as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in the following year. As a subaltern he saw service in Menorca in 1798 and at Malta in 1800. As a captain he took part in the unfortunate Montevideo Expedition of 1806‚Äì07, and in 1809 he accompanied Brigadier General Edward Howorth to Portugal where he served as brigade-major of the artillery. He soon obtained a command in the Portuguese artillery, and as a lieutenant colonel of the Portuguese service took part in the various battles of 1810‚Äì11. At the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, the Salamanca forts, and Burgos, he was entrusted by Wellington with most of the detailed artillery work. At the Battle of Salamanca he commanded the reserve artillery. In the end he became commander of the whole of the artillery of the allied army, and though still only a substantive captain in the British service, he had under his orders some 8000 men. He played a key role in the successful conclusion of the Siege of San Sebasti√°n in 1813. At the battles of Vitoria, the Pyrenees and Toulouse he directed the movements of the artillery engaged, and at the end of the war received handsome presents from the officers who had served under him, many of whom were his seniors in the army list. He was at the disastrous Battle of New Orleans, but returned to Europe in time for the Waterloo campaign. He was present at Quatre Bras and Waterloo on the artillery staff of Wellington's army, and subsequently commanded the British battering train at the sieges of the French fortresses left behind the advancing allies.

The bridge opened to traffic on January 15, 1963, the same day that the Cross- Bronx Expressway was completed. For 2011, the New York City Department of Transportation, which operates and maintains the bridge, reported an average daily traffic volume in both directions of 182,174; having reached a peak ADT of 192,848 in 1990.

The parallel main spans of the steel arch bridge stretch long over the Harlem River and provide of vertical clearance at the center and of horizontal clearance. History After the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey was completed in 1931, vehicles traveling between New Jersey and the Bronx would travel over the Washington Bridge, which crosses the Harlem River just north of the present Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge was planned in the mid-1950s to connect Robert Moses' proposed Trans-Manhattan and Cross-Bronx Expressways and to accommodate the additional traffic resulting from the addition of the six-lane lower level to the George Washington Bridge. With the Interstate designation, 90% of the $21 million in construction costs were covered by the federal government. The bridge design included a set of spiraling ramps (colloquially known as \\"The Corkscrew\\") to connect to and from the Major Deegan Expressway (completed in 1964) and a viaduct ramp connecting to the Harlem River Drive, both of which are over below the level of the bridge, and access to Amsterdam Avenue. The bridge underwent a full renovation from 2009 to 2014. The construction estimate was $400 million. By mid-2012, one of the eastbound lanes of the bridge had been closed to accommodate construction vehicles. While the traffic jams created from the construction had not been as bad as local officials had anticipated, inbound delays at the Hudson River crossings increased after the project began. In July 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the bridge renovation was complete. The renovation of the bridge was the premise of The Weather Channel show Iron Men.

Early years Richard Waite was born in London in 1848 as one of seven children (surviving included William T, Helen and Jennie) of Charles Henry Waite and his wife Harriet Humphries Holland. Richard Waite's father moved to America in 1856 with his wife and children and settled in Buffalo, New York to work in a printing company. Education and career Waite like many early architects, learned building design as an apprentice. He studied mechanical engineering in New York City under John Ericsson, the inventor of the Civil War ironclad USS Monitor. Waite returned to Buffalo in 1874 as a fully trained architect. His 1869 marriage to Sarah Holloway, daughter of local contractor Isaac Holloway, afforded him several public works commissions. In 1876, he made architectural history by hiring Louise Blanchard Bethune as a draftsman. She went on to become the first professional woman architect in the United States. Projects Although Waite designed many homes in the Buffalo area, some of his best-known commissions were in Canada. Some of Waite's key accomplishments: =Buffalo, New York= *Trinity Episcopal Church (Delaware Avenue and Johnson Park) 1872 (plans only as Trinity Episcopal Church was built by another architect in the 1880s) *Public School 32 (32 South Cedar Street), built late 1870s; later demolished and replaced. The replacement structure is now used by Bennett Park Montessori School. *Pierce's Palace Hotel, built 1878 (Beaux-Arts architecture//Classical Revival architecture) - located on Porter Avenue and burned down in 1881, it is now the site of D'Youville College campus at Prospect Park. *Walden-Myer Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo, built 1885 (Romanesque Revival) *Buffalo German Insurance Company Building, built 1875 - (Second Empire architecture) office building located at Main and Lafayette Square; demolished ca. 1957 and now site of Tishman Building *W.H.

Description Leaf close up showing mucilaginous glands Drosera adelae is a tropical perennial plant that produces long, sword-shaped leaves in a basal rosette. The leaves, like most other Drosera species, are covered with sticky, stalked tentacles that secrete the prey-capturing glue.McPherson, Stewart. 2008. Glistening Carnivores. Poole, Dorset, England: Redfern Natural History Productions. pp. 212-214. Tentacle movement in this species, unlike other Drosera, is minimal and slow to the point of being barely noticeable.McPherson, Stewart. 2008. Glistening Carnivores. Poole, Dorset, England: Redfern Natural History Productions. p. 35. The leaves are narrowly lanceolate and are typically long and 7‚Äì10 mm wide. The lower surface of the leaves are glabrous and petioles are either very short or absent. Inflorescences are one-sided raceme and up to long, bearing many red, reddish orange, or cream coloured flowers from June to November. The five petals produce a perfect pentagon shape.Lowrie, Allen. 1998. Carnivorous Plants of Australia: Volume 3. Nedlands, Western Australia: University of Western Australia Press. pp. 132-135. Drosera adelae reproduces rapidly by asexual means, generating new plantlets from the spreading roots, which means this species is often found in large clumps. This species has a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 30, though a cultivated cytotype of the species had been reported as having 2n = 28, which botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested may represent different forms of the species.Rivadavia, Fernando. 2005. New chromosome numbers for Drosera L. (Droseraceae). Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 34(3): 85-91. Distribution and habitat Range of D. adelae in the wildFlower (approximately 3 mm across) Drosera adelae typically grows in the densely shaded margins of the northeastern Australian rainforests in sandy soils along creek banks or on wet rocks near waterfalls. The species is native to Rockingham Bay, Hinchinbrook Island in Queensland, Australia. It shares similar habitats with the other two closely related Queensland Drosera: D. schizandra and D. prolifera. Together they're known as the sisters of queensland. Botanical history Drosera adelae was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller in volume 4 of his work Fragmenta phytographi√¶ Australi√¶, published in 1864. A later infraspecific taxon, described by Ludwig Diels in his 1909 work published in a volume of Das Pflanzenreich as D. adelae var. latior F.Muell. ex Diels is now considered to be a synonym of D. schizandra.Schlauer, J. 2011. World Carnivorous Plant List - Nomenclatural Synopsis of Carnivorous Phanerogamous Plants. Accessed online: 14 August 2011. Cultivation Though it is a tropical plant, D. adelae is somewhat tolerant of frost and can return from its roots after short periods of cold temperatures just below the freezing point.D'Amato, Peter. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Berkeley, California: Ten Speed Press. p. 51. It can be grown in brighter light, less humidity, and cooler temperatures than its closely allied relatives, D. prolifera and D. schizandra. In low light conditions, the leaves are typically greener and the plant can grow to be a foot in diameter, but brighter light will cause the plants to produce shorter, bronze coloured leaves.D'Amato, Peter. 1998.

It is the first of the Jack Flanders adventure series, and combines elements of Americana and Old-time radio with metaphysical concepts such as past life regression, Sufi wisdom, Tibetan Buddhism and shamanistic communication with the natural world.ZBS.org link (The Fourth Tower of Inverness)National Audio Theatre Festivals, Inc \\"Meatball Fulton Profile\\" link (Interview with Meatball Fulton) The adventure takes place in an estate called Inverness, and the action focuses upon a mysterious and (at first) illusory extra tower of the mansion, which many visitors have attempted to reach and ultimately vanished in the process. The program was originally broadcast in 7-minute-long episodes and runs a total of seven and half hours. History The Fourth Tower of Inverness was written and directed by Meatball Fulton. The initial story concept was created while he was staying at a farmhouse outside of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The farm was called Inverness, and was named and designed after a house the original owner had owned in Inverness, Scotland. It had been abandoned for ten years, but was being looked after by an old caretaker. The initial characters were written for other guests at the farmhouse, who were friends and acquaintances of Meatball Fulton, although the series was not produced at this time.Zounds! link (The ZBS Story Part 1) In June 1970, Meatball Fulton moved to Fort Edward, New York to help found ZBS Media, with a focus on producing commercials for various musical acts such as Billy Joel, Little Feat, Jefferson Airplane and Captain Beefheart. After about a year and a half of this, he became bored with writing commercials, and had an uncomfortable experience producing an album for Abbie Hoffman.Zounds! link (The ZBS Story Part 2) Remembering the radio play he had written back in Montreal, he decided to produce his own script. The story was fleshed out, actors were cast, and the episodes were produced periodically whenever new scripts were written. Some of the featured actors cast were Robert Lorick in the lead role, Murray Head, and Dave Herman as narrator. The relaxed nature of the production can still be heard, with occasional breaking of character by the cast, and laughing when lines are flubbed. Eventually a backer was found, Augie Blume of Grunt Records, who helped shape the series down to 7-minute daily episodes, and half-hour weekend episodes. The Fourth Tower of Inverness played on 397 college radio stations between 1972 and 1973. A poster created by David Byrd helped promote the series. More than 10,000 posters were distributed in lots of 20-25 to participating radio stations. \\"The poster provided spaced, integrated into the 'Lotus Jukebox' (a key element in the plot and one of the focal points of the poster), which permitted stations to insert their call letters, frequency, and time of broadcast.\\" The series was a hit on college radio stations, and has since been broadcast in several different formats, such as on NPR Playhouse and The Watt from Pedro Show. It has also been available for purchase in many audio formats including record, cassette, CD, and MP3. Story Jack Flanders, a hitchhiker and drifter, is invited to the estate of his aunt, Lady Sarah Jowls. As Jack approaches the estate, he sees an outline of the mansion silhouetted against the night sky, with four distinct towers reaching up to the sky, though his aunt and everyone else who lives there insists there are only three towers. Jack slowly becomes familiar with the strange inhabitants of Inverness, including the mansion's caretaker, Old Far-seeing Art, who can listen to the aum sound emanating from the center of the Universe, and tends to the estate's hedge maze, a place that only he can enter without going insane. Others include Dr. Mazoola, an alchemist of the first order, Jives the Butler, who is an old quick-change artist with a dry sense of humor, the Madonna Vampyra, an energy vampire who lives in the mansion's hollow walls, Wham Bam Shazam, a young man with a penchant for the 1950s whom Chief Wampum is teaching to fly, and Little Frieda, a Venusian who is a \\"million and a half\\" years old, but looks like a small girl with no pupils in her eyes, large pigtails, and a penchant for smoking huge Havana cigars. The group teaches Jack what he needs to know in order to successfully enter, and, more importantly, return from, the Fourth Tower, ranging from an explanation of the Tibeten Wheel of Life to a past-life regression and a lesson on how to draw energy from trees. Lord Henry Jowls, the husband of Lady Jowls, vanished without a trace into the mysterious Fourth Tower some years ago. Lady Jowls is disturbed by the recent happenings at the mansion, in particular an old jukebox somewhere in one of the mansion's towers, that plays 1950's songs whenever an accident is about to occur. Accidents have been on the rise in Inverness recently, and range from simple misunderstandings involving an aroused kundalini to a fire-breathing dragon. Jack realizes that the mysterious jukebox must be playing in the invisible Fourth Tower, and is determined to find its source. It is said that in the past, eight people have seen and entered the fourth tower of Inverness, and none have returned alive. Jack Flanders is the ninth.

Its three towers appear to pierce the sky, its windows are like a thousand eyes turned inward, and its doors, hinged on time, open into endless space. The Fourth Tower of Inverness! Jukeboxes During his adventures, Jack Flanders encounters several jukeboxes, each with a different theme. * Whirlitzer of Wisdom ‚Äì This is the first jukebox discovered, and the only one outside of the Fourth Tower. For the price of a dime, it plays various wisdoms by people such as Ram Dass and Don Van Vliet (billed as the Venerable Van Vliet). Its name is based on the classic Wurlitzer jukebox. * Great Green Jade Jukebox ‚Äì This is the second jukebox discovered, inside the Fourth Tower. It is able to bring a city to life, replaying encounters in the order of the tracks on the jukebox, starting with track #1. In order to reach the next step, track 2 must be played, and so on. * Bodhisattva Jukebox ‚Äì This is the final jukebox discovered inside the Fourth Tower. It features the song \\"Kirtan\\" by Bhagavan Das, and listening to it brings understanding. The characters' heads and arms expand, in a way similar to a story of the bodhisattva canon. * Lotus Jukebox ‚Äì Source of the haunting music (1950's songs). Although this is what he is searching for in The Fourth Tower of Inverness, Jack Flanders does not find it until The Ah-Ha Phenomenon. Music In the series there are many musical interludes: *\\"Angel Baby\\" ‚Äì Rosie and the Originals *\\"Devil or Angel\\" ‚Äì The Clovers *\\"Most of All\\" ‚Äì The Moonglows *\\"Oh What a Night\\" ‚Äì The Dells *\\"Where Do You Come From\\" ‚Äì Elvis Presley *\\"The Golden Wedding\\" ‚Äì Woody Herman and His Orchestra *\\"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\\" ‚Äì Elvis Presley *\\"There Goes My Baby\\" ‚Äì The Drifters *\\"It's All in the Game\\" ‚Äì Tommy Edwards *\\"Yellow Brick Road\\" ‚Äì Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band *\\"Duke of Earl\\" ‚Äì Gene Chandler *\\"Green Eyes\\" ‚Äì Helen O'Connell/Jimmy Dorsey and his Orchestra/Bob Eberly *\\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\" ‚Äì Jerry Lee Lewis *\\"Jazzbo Stomp\\" ‚Äì Memphis Jug Band *\\"Hit the Road Jack\\" ‚Äì Ray Charles *\\"Sh-Boom\\" ‚Äì The Chords *\\"The Traveller\\" ‚Äì Jade Warrior Influences The idea of a jukebox that plays whenever an accident was about to occur was based on and paying homage to an episode of the radio show I Love a Mystery, which featured an organ playing in the basement whenever an accident would occur. The name of the lead character, Jack Flanders, was also in homage to the hero on I Love a Mystery, Jack Packard. The past life regression sequence is taken from a real life experience, and shows the actual past life relationships between series author Meatball Fulton and actress Laura Esterman, who plays the Madonna Vampyra. The technique of regression was developed by William Swygard, adapted from the pamphlet Multi-Level Awareness and was available as a booklet by mail. Sequel The Fourth Tower of Inverness is the beginning of the Jack Flanders series, and several of the characters introduced continue to appear in later adventures. Jack briefly returns to the mansion of Inverness in Moon Over Morocco (1973), and the quest for the Lotus Jukebox continues in The Ah-Ha Phenomenon (1977). A direct sequel was produced in 2000, Return to Inverness, which re-united most of the original cast.

During the engagement, at approximately 10:00, the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry delivered a striking blow by capturing very first Confederate general officer of the war, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer. Almost immediately after this success, the regiment was ambushed by an attack on their right flank, losing seventy- seven percent of their ranks, including most officers. Fairchild was shot in the upper arm, captured, tended to, and released. While recovering from his amputated left arm, Fairchild was commissioned as a brigadier general by President Abraham Lincoln on October 19, 1863. Political and diplomatic career Fairchild resigned from the military in November 1863 and was appointed Secretary of State of Wisconsin (1864‚Äì1866), before being elected three term Governor of Wisconsin (1866‚Äì1872). After his time as governor, Fairchild was appointed U.S. consul at Liverpool (1871) and then consul general at Paris (1880‚Äì1881), Fairchild was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain.Fairchild, Lucius 1831 - 1896Wisconsin Historical Society  Wisconsin Historical Images Fairchild later served as Commander-in- Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (1886‚Äì1887) and of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (1893‚Äì1895); during the former of these terms, he came to national prominence for calling upon God to \\"palsy\\" President Grover Cleveland for offering to return several captured Confederate battle flags to the veterans of their respective regiments as a peace gesture towards the South. He was also a member of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. Fairchild also received 95 degrees in the Masonic Order \\"Egyptian Masonic Rite of Memphis\\". He died in Madison, Wisconsin in May 1896. Fairchild was also known as an outspoken \\"Radical Republican\\", he fervently supported civil rights for blacks and vehemently opposed Rutherford B. Hayes for \\"appeasing\\" southern segregationists in what he referred to as \\"the second civil war\\". He believed Reconstruction ended too early, and on terms he described as \\"cowardly\\" and \\"disgraceful\\". He supported Wisconsin Senator Timothy O. Howe in pushing for more severe measures in the South that would guarantee civil rights by force.Ross, Sam. The Empty Sleeve: A Biography of Lucius Fairchild. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1964. pp. 107, 110, 125. Family General Lucius Fairchild, John Singer Sargent, 1887 Lucius Fairchild was of entirely English ancestry. His family tree can be traced through three large migrations. Firstly all of his ancestors migrated from England to New England during the Puritan migration to New England during the early colonial period, between 1620 and 1640. In the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution all of Fairchild's ancestors moved from New England to the region of upstate New York, and only one generation after that, following the Northwest Indian War they moved to the northern part of Ohio.The Empty Sleeve: A Biography of Lucius Fairchild, by Sam Ross (State Historical Society of Wisconsin for the Wisconsin Civil War Centennial Commission, 1964) Fairchild had a grandfather and a great-grandfather who fought in the American Revolution. Fairchild is a descendant of Thomas Fairchild who emigrated to North America in 1639. His parents were Sally (Blair) and Jairus C. Fairchild, who was the first State Treasurer of Wisconsin and the first Mayor of the city of Madison, Wisconsin. His brother, Cassius Fairchild, served as Democratic Party Leader in the Wisconsin State Assembly, and also served in the Union Army during the American Civil War with the rank of colonel (and brevet brigadier general). His brother Charles served in the Union Navy during the war. His wife was Frances Bull Fairchild, and together they had three daughters: Mary, Sarah, and Caryl. Legacy The town of Fairchild, Wisconsin and the Liberty ship SS Lucius Fairchild, built in 1943 in Portland, Oregon for the United States War Shipping Administration, were named in his honor, as was Mount Fairchild (13,502'), a prominent peak located in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. In Kent, Ohio, where Fairchild was born in 1831, Fairchild Avenue is named after him. Fairchild visited Kent with much fanfare in 1887 and the road was officially named for him in 1904.

The dispute was primarily between unionised and non-unionised wool workers. It resulted in the formation of large camps of striking workers, and minor instances of sabotage and violence on both sides. The strike was poorly timed, and when the union workers ran out of food, they were forced to come to terms. The outcome is credited as being one of the factors for the formation of the Australian Labor Party and the rise to power of a pro-Labor Party faction in the Australian Socialist League. Background Working conditions for sheep shearers in 19th century Australia were not good. In 1891 wool was one of Australia's largest industries, but as the wool industry grew, so did the number and influence of shearers. By 1890, the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia boasted tens of thousands of members, and had unionised thousands of sheds. At their annual conference in Bourke in 1890, the Union laid down a new rule, which prohibited members from working with non-union workers. Soon after, shearers at Jondaryan Station on the Darling Downs went on strike over this issue. As non-union labour was still able to process the wool, the Jondaryan shearers called for help. The Rockhampton wharfies responded and refused to touch the Jondaryan wool. The unionists won the battle. This galvanised the squatters, and they formed the Pastoralists' Federal Council, to counter the strength of the unions. The Australian Socialist League also involved itself directly with the shearers as the strike loomed (which would lead to its involvement in the foundation of the Australian Labor Party). The strike Workers' library at Barcaldine, during the strike. Many union shearers were outraged when Logan Downs Station Manager Charles Fairbain asked the shearers to sign a contract that would reduce the power of their union. On 5 January 1891 the shearers announced a strike until the following demands for a contract were met: *Continuation of existing rates of pay *Protection of workers' rights and privileges *Just and equitable agreements *Exclusion of low-cost Chinese labour, which manifested itself later as Labor Party policy - the Immigration Restriction Act, also known as the White Australia Policy - although anti-Chinese demands were opposed by the Australian Socialist League, which was heavily involved with the strike. The strike started and quickly spread. From February until May, central Queensland was on the brink of civil war. Striking shearers formed armed camps outside of towns. Thousands of armed soldiers protected non-union labour and arrested strike leaders. The unionists retaliated by raiding shearing sheds, harassing non-union labour and committing acts of sabotage, although the incidents of actual violence or arson were few. Card celebrating shearers as Unionist Prisoners after the shearers strike in Barcaldine One of the first May Day marches in the world took place during the strike on 1 May 1891 in Barcaldine. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that 1340 men took part of whom 618 were mounted on horse. Banners carried included those of the Australian Labor Federation, the Shearers' and Carriers' Unions, and one inscribed 'Young Australia'. The leaders wore blue sashes and the Eureka Flag was carried. The \\"Labor Bulletin\\" reported that cheers were given for \\"the Union\\", \\"the Eight-hour day\\", \\"the Strike Committee\\" and \\"the boys in gaol\\". It reported the march: > In the procession every civilised country was represented doing duty for the > Russian, Swede, French, Dane etc, who are germane to him in other climes, > showing that Labor's cause is one the world over, foreshadowing the time > when the swords shall be turned into ploughshares and Liberty, Peace and > Friendship will knit together the nations of the earth. But the shearers were unable to hold out. The summer had been unseasonably wet, and the strike was poorly timed for maximum effect on the shearing season (winter). By May the union camps were full of hungry penniless shearers. The strike had been broken. The squatters had won this time, but it had proved a costly exercise. Thirteen union leaders were charged with sedition and conspiracy, taken to Rockhampton for the trial, convicted, and sentenced to three years in gaol on St Helena Island Prison. The 1891 shearers' strike is credited as being one of the factors for the formation of the Australian Labor Party. Three of those imprisoned (William Hamilton, Julian Stuart, and George Taylor) later became Labor members of parliament ‚Äì Hamilton in Queensland and the other two in Western Australia.Centenary of Shearers Strike & Labour Movement, Monuments Australia. Retrieved 7 January 2017. Literary references and allusions Henry Lawson's well known poem, Freedom on the Wallaby, was written as a comment on the strike and published by William Lane in the Worker in Brisbane, 16 May 1891. And William Lane wrote his novel in 1892, The workingman's paradise, with two aims: to support fundraising efforts for the imprisoned unionists, and to explain unionism and socialism to those who would listen.Lane, William (1892) \\"Preface\\" to The Workingman's Paradise, Sydney, Sydney University Press, 2009 edition Banjo Paterson's song Waltzing Matilda, an unofficial Australian anthem, was also written about this era of shearers' industrial disputes in Queensland. Helen Palmer's song 'The Ballad of 1891', set to music by Doreen Jacobs, details the lead up to the strike and aftermath. The 1975 film Sunday Too Far Away, directed by Ken Hannam has been partly inspired by the events surrounding this strike. Playwright Errol O'Neill wrote On the Whipping Side ‚Äì a play about the 1891 shearers' strike. This was first performed by the Queensland Theatre Company in 1991 and toured parts of Queensland.

Nur Misuari was installed as the region's governor but his rule ended in violence when he led a failed rebellion against the Philippine government in November 2001, and fled to Sabah before being deported back to the Philippines by the Malaysian authorities. The MNLF is internationally recognized by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and its Parliamentary Union of OIC Member States (PUIC). Since 1977, the MNLF has been an observer member of the OIC.List of Observer Members of Organization of Islamic Conference On January 30, 2012, MNLF became an observer member of the Parliamentary Union of Islamic Cooperation (PUIC), as approved during the 7th PUIC global session held in Palembang, Indonesia.  Background  The Philippine government wanted to encourage migration of landless Christians from other parts of the country in a so-called Homestead Program (1903‚Äì1973). There was no land titling system by the natives of Mindanao at that time, and the Christian settlers exploited the situation. Lanao and Cotabato received an influx of migrants from Luzon and Visayas. Tensions between Moros and Christians were caused by disputes about land ownership and disenfranchisement of Muslims. The Homestead Program is one of the root-causes of the Moro conflict.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406868 Poverty, grievances of the Muslim population, weak rule of law and difficult terrain have made counterterrorism challenging against insurgents in the Southern Philippines. On March 18, 1968 there was an alleged massacre of Moro soldiers in Corregidor Island. There has been a long-standing allegation that Malaysia provided the initial training and arming of the first batch of MNLF cadres known as \\"Top 90\\" in 1969. Likewise, it has also been alleged that Malaysia was either seemingly ignorant or tolerated the illicit arms shipments, mainly from the Middle East, flowing into Mindanao that fueled the insurgency. The founder and former leader of the MNLF is Nur Misuari. The MNLF was founded as a splinter group of the Muslim Independence Movement on October 21, 1972. MNLF officially claims that its ideology is egalitarianism, and it is not a religious organization like its Islamic splinter group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.  Leadership and splits  The MNLF was the leading organization among Moro separatists for about two decades beginning from the 1970s. However, discontent on Nur Misuari's leadership caused the group to unravel especially after the 1996 peace agreement. Integration of former rebels in the society was also a factor in the weakening. At the present there are multiple competing factions. For instance, Hadja Bainon Karon's faction supported peace deal in 2012, after Nur Misuari had criticized it. There was also a case of defections of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) fighters to MNLF. , the current chairman of the group is uncertain and the sources, including Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Philippine Government, disagree. Nur Misuari still has support among some of the factions. Many splits followed tribal affiliation. United Nations Security Council report stated in 2010 that the splinter groups Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf recruit and use child soldiers in the conflict.  Peace talks  Libyan and Muammar Gaddafi's mediation resulted in the Tripoli Agreement on December 23, 1976. It would have established an autonomous region and given Moros influence on foreign policy, military, education, courts, and finances. Areas such as Basilan, Palawan and Sulu would have been included in the autonomous region. The plans failed due to president Ferdinand Marcos' decision to hold a referendum on each area that was to be included in the autonomous region. Most of the regions did not have a Muslim majority. The referendums however did influence Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao by creating its predecessors. MNLF decided to continued armed struggle. The MNLF shifted from demands of full independence to autonomy in the 1980s. In 1986 a ceasefire and attempts to have a peace agreement were made, but they failed. Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was established in 1989, despite opposition from the MNLF. OIC, Libya and Indonesia mediated peace talks which were restarted in 1992. Statements of Understanding and Interim Agreements were made between 1992 and 1996. Jakarta Peace Agreement was signed in 1996. Tensions between the Philippine Government and the MNLF have been fueled by mineral wealth sharing, problems of implementing the peace agreement and the Nur Misuari faction's ongoing opposition of the peace agreement. In 2015 Nur Misuari rejected reports on the MNLF involvement in the North Borneo dispute and said only the Sultanate of Sulu can pursue the negotiations for the Sabah claim with the Malaysian sides. The MNLF has asserted that their group are not involved in any part of the North Borneo dispute and stressing it is a non- issue as Sabah has become the \\"home-base for different tribal groupings of Muslims from different regions of Southeast Asia that have enjoyed peaceful and harmonious co-existence with the Chinese and Christian populace in the area.\\" European Union and the United States do not use the classification of \\"terrorist\\" for the MNLF.  Zamboanga City crisis  Zamboanga City hall pictured In 2013, the Nur Misuari faction of the MNLF declared independence for the Bangsamoro Republik and attacked Zamboanga City. During the MNLF standoff with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the group was accused by the Philippines of using civilians as human shields, thus leading the Philippine government to label them terrorists. The State Department of the United States included a mention of the siege in its report on \\"East Asia and Pacific Overview\\".  Present  President Rodrigo Duterte with Nur Misuari during their meeting at Davao City Currently, the Moro National Liberation Front under Nur Misuari is still in talks with President Rodrigo Duterte. Misuari has been meeting with Duterte ever since the signing of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) in Davao City. Duterte is also considering autonomy to be given to Misuari. Misuari also talked with Duterte about Federalism according to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. Under Yusoph Jikiri and Muslimin Sema Group, they are part of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Jikiri and Sema along with wife Congresswoman Bai Sandra Sema supports the Bangsamoro Organic Law.  Flag  Flag of the MNLF without inscriptions The Moro National Liberation Front makes use of a flag consist of a golden yellow star and crescent and a kris on a red field. The star represents Truthfulness, Fairness, Equality and Tolerance while the crescent moon symbolizes wisdom. The kris symbolizes strength. The red field represents the Bangsamoro activism, decisiveness, persistence, frugality, and sacrifices in pushing forward the revolutionary struggle for survival, self- determination, and success. The flag design is secular despite having a star and crescent, a symbol often associated with Islam. The flag has not been standardized and many variation exists regarding the scaling of elements in the flag. A variant, with a shahadah on the star and crescent exists. The flag was also used for the Bangsamoro Republik, a widely unrecognized state declared by the group.

The school is named after preservationist John Muir. History In 1926 the Pasadena Unified School District constructed a second high school in the northwest corner of the city. The school was named John Muir Technical High School and though majority white, it served a growing community of black, Japanese-American and Mexican-American students. In 1938 the school was converted into a junior college and renamed Pasadena Junior College West. It closed during WW2 and was used by the US Army as a Training School. Muir re-opened as John Muir Junior College in 1947. The school combined the last two years of high school with a full junior college curriculum. In the Fall semester of 1954, the school changed again to its present John Muir High School, a full four-year high school. Prior to 1964, many white students from the community of La Canada Flintridge, California joined those from the black neighborhood of northwest Pasadena and the racially mixed community of Altadena, and enrollment was nearly 3,000 students. In 1963, La Ca√±ada Flintridge built its own high school and removed its students, except for those who would graduate in 1964. Shortly after that, the Pasadena City School District created Blair High School, siphoning off another large portion of the school's population. Student profile Approximately 1100 students attended John Muir High School during the 2012-2013 school year. The student body is 65% Hispanic, 30% Black/non- Hispanic, 2% White, 1% Asian/Pacific-Islander and 1% two or more races. Recent awards to students and staff In 2014, Muir Engineering Academy senior Brenden Dickerson was named an Edison Scholar. Brenden is one of 30 high school seniors from across Southern California Edison's (SCE) service territory who have been named 2014 Edison Scholars, each winning a $40,000 scholarship offered by Edison International, parent company of SCE. In 2014 and 2011, John Muir High School's Solar Cup team won 1st place in the 200 m sprint competition‚Äì beating the rest of the schools from the Foothill Division including Arcadia, Duarte, and La Ca√±ada. Solar Cup is a competition in which high school teams totaling about 800 students build and race solar-powered boats at Lake Skinner, in Temecula Valley. In 2014, Lydia Jimenez won the 2014 Association of California School Administrators Oratory Contest for Pasadena Unified School District.John Muir High School congratulates its senior Lydia Jimenez for winning the 2014 ACSA Oratory Contest for Pasadena Unified School District Several John Muir High School students have won the Gates Millennium Scholarship for outstanding minority high school students: Carmen Marand (2005), Jessica Murillo (2007), Claudia Lima-Rocha and Breana Powell (2009); Valeria Sosa (2011); Kimberly Mejia (2015). The net financial value of the scholarship is approximately $250,000 and covers all tuition, meals, dorms, registration, technology fees, and other expenses for students' Bachelor's, Master's, and the first two years of Doctorate degrees. The scholarship is awarded to 1,000 students nationwide. In 2014, Abigail Jacob was named Gates Millennium Scholarship finalist. In 2012, Manuel Rustin, a social studies teacher, was awarded with the Milken Educator Award, which includes a $25,000 award for top educators in the U.S. In 2014, Yasmine Rodriguez took 2nd place in the Teen Prose category at LitFest Pasadena for her short story entitled, \\"Light.\\" Early College Magnet In October 2017, John Muir High School was awarded a Magnet Schools Assistance Program grant from the U.S. Department of Education to establish a new Early College Magnet program. The grant provided funding to fully implement a four-year early college program, wherein students have the opportunity to earn college and high school credits simultaneously by taking Pasadena City College courses during the high school day. Classes are taught by Pasadena City College faculty at PCC Northwest, a college campus located on the property of John Muir High School. Early College classes are offered to all Muir students for free. Students do not pay any course or materials fees. College and Career Pathways (Linked Learning) Muir students participate in one of three \\"College and Career Pathways\\": Arts, Entertainment and Media; Engineering and Environmental Science; Business and Entrepreneurship. All three of these pathways have the distinction of being recognized as Linked Learning certified by ConnectEd. So far, only 37 schools and pathways in California have been recognized as Linked Learning certified. In the Arts, Entertainment and Media Pathway, students are trained from 9th to 12th grade in music, drama, film and video production, graphic design, photography, painting, sculpting, and other fine arts. During their high school career, students fine-tune their creative energy, master self- expression and hone their critical thinking and problem-solving in classes like graphic design, animation, and film/video production. They also have the opportunity to turn their natural gifts and artistic passions into real-world skills through career insight opportunities at local art centers and design firms that provide valuable behind-the-scenes job shadowing and hands-on training and internships. In the Engineering and Environmental Science Pathway students learn to use the power of science and mathematics to improve the quality of life on earth. This 9th through 12th grade Pathway is affiliated with the National Academy Foundation's Academy of Engineering that features the Project Lead the Way pre-engineering curriculum. In the Business and Entrepreneurship program, this well-rounded curriculum includes business management, finance, accounting, marketing and entrepreneurship courses designed to strengthen leadership, problem-solving, organizational and management skills. Each course of study provides an in-depth analysis of business, financial and corporate trends and strategies in the marketplace. On campus clubs, student activities and group projects provide extensive, hands- on training in the business and financial system that governs our society. Reinvention effort For several years, Muir High School was under state monitoring. In October 2007, the PUSD Board of education approved the reconstitution of John Muir High School for the 2008-2009 school year. The district worked with parents, staff, local businesses and other community members to develop a reconstitution plan, which later became known as Muir's \\"reinvention\\" plan. The reform effort soon received support from ConnectEd, an organization partnering with the Irvine Foundation to implement Linked Learning in districts across California. The focus was a reform plan which included the re-vamping of the academic structure to include College and Career Pathways (Linked Learning), professional development, extensive community support and requiring all teachers and staff to re-apply for their jobs. John Muir High School's implementation of the Linked Learning reform effort was featured in an extensive two-year study by Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education (SCOPE).https://edpolicy.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/linked- learning-pasadena-creating-collaborative-culture-sustainable-district- reform.pdf According to the SCOPE study, \\"by many accounts, in just 3 years, Muir High School has, in fact, very credibly demonstrated the success of the Linked Learning model. The school has evolved from a traditional, comprehensive high school to a campus with three Linked Learning pathways that offer integrated curriculum, authentic learning experiences, and personalized support for students. Early indications are that Muir, still with more than 90% of its students identifying as either African American or Latino, has made impressive gains during the initial years of implementation of Linked Learning. Among the gains are a dramatic reduction in dropouts over the last two years (from a 34% drop out rate to a 9% dropout rate). In addition, Muir's Academic Performance Index has steadily risen since the 2007-2008 school year for the school as a whole as well as for significant subgroups. This represents the fastest rate of increase of all the high schools in PUSD during that time period.\\" According to the district website, as a result of the reinvention effort, John Muir High School has achieved a 57-point increase on its Academic Performance Index since 2007. In the 2012-2013 school year, the drop out rate decreased again to 7.8%. Muir Ranch From 2011 to 2018, a team of volunteer teachers and students began converting 1.5 acres of the John Muir High School campus into an urban farm. Muir Ranch grows a variety of flowers, vegetables and fruits. Students can complete community service or internship graduation requirements by enrolling in classes at the Ranch. Muir Ranch also provides paid internships to students, which are funded by private donations, special events, farmer's market sales, and subscriptions to the produce box program (CSA). Documentary In 2019 filmmaker and Muir Alumnus Pablo Miralles completed a film about John Muir High School called, Can We All Get Along? Stories of Integration from John Muir High School. The movie contains the stories of alumni, parents, teachers and administrators from over 80 years at the Northwest school, from its traditionally black, Mexican- American, Japanese-American, and white - base when \\"naturally\\" integrated, to busing and finally to its current \\"resegregation\\" into an almost entirely Latino and black campus. Athletics In football, the Mustangs have dominated the Pacific League the past two seasons (2013, 2014), combining to go 14-0 while winning back-to-back league crowns and appearances in the quarter and semifinals of the CIF Southern Section Southeast playoffs. Muir student, Dejon Williams was named \\"2014 Offensive Player of the Year\\" by the Pasadena Star News. Williams was Pacific League MVP. He recently signed with the New Mexico State University Aggies. Tierra Adams is a top tier thrower in the state of California in the sport of track and field. She is a defending CIF champion in shot put, took 4th in the AAU Junior Olympic Games in North Carolina, 5th indoor state, and 7th in Arcadia Invitational. She recently signed with the Fresno State Bulldogs. In 2012, Muir football cornerback Kevon Seymour was signed by the University of Southern California. He was ranked as the #15 cornerback in the United States by ESPN. =Turkey Tussle= The Annual Turkey Tussle Football Game tradition began in 1947 when the game was played between Pasadena Community College and John Muir Junior College. The two schools played until 1953. In 1954 the annual rivalry was played between what is now Pasadena High School and John Muir High School and is normally held at the Rose Bowl Stadium. Muir has won the Turkey Tussle for the past 16 years.

The teacher lured two students from the school in addition to another minor through the internet. Furthermore, numerous instances of cyber sex were conducted between the teacher and various minors as young as 12. In 2002, caucasian teacher Scott Phelps was the center of controversy when he asserted that the majority of the students who are failing and disruptive were black. Opinion was divisive with whites and blacks from the community on both sides. While some students and teachers defended that his assertion that the majority of the under performing students were black was accurate, others took offense to it. Subsequently, he was placed on administrative leave but allowed to return to the school a few days later. In 2005, Phelps was elected to a four- year term on Pasadena Unified School District Board of Trustees, where he remains as of 2018.

G. Wells' The Time Machine) is a 1960 American science fiction film in Metrocolor from Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, produced and directed by George Pal, that stars Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, and Alan Young. The film was based on the 1895 novella of the same name by H. G. Wells that was influential on the development of science fiction. An inventor in Victorian England constructs a machine that enables him to travel into the distant future; once there, he discovers that mankind's descendants have divided into two species, the passive, childlike, and vegetarian Eloi and the underground-dwelling Morlocks, who feed on the Eloi. George Pal, who had made the first film version of Wells' The War of the Worlds (1953), always intended to make a sequel to The Time Machine, but he died before it could be produced; the end of Time Machine: The Journey Back functions as a sequel of sorts. In 1985, elements of this film were incorporated into the documentary The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit. Gene Warren and Tim Baar received the Academy Award for Best Special Effects for its time-lapse photographic effects, which show the world changing rapidly as the time traveler journeys into the future. Plot On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at the London home of their inventor friend George, but he is absent. He arrives suddenly, bedraggled and exhausted, and tells what has happened to him. At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George says that time is \\"the fourth dimension\\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a small model time machine and has one of them press a tiny lever on the model. The device disappears, but his friends are skeptical. George has a full-size time machine which he uses to travel ahead to September 13, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war. He then stops on June 19, 1940, during the Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \\"a new war\\". George resumes his journey and stops on August 18, 1966. People hurry into a fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to take cover. Moments later, a nuclear satellite explodes, causing a volcanic eruption. George narrowly makes it back to his machine ahead of the approaching lava, which rises, cools, and hardens, trapping him inside, as he travels far into the future. Eventually the lava wears away, revealing a lush, unspoiled landscape. George stops at October 12, 802,701, near the base of a sphinx. He finds a group of delicate young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help, but her companions show no concern. George rescues her. She says her name is Weena and her people are the Eloi; they do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of history. One of them takes George to a library, but when he tries to read a book, it crumbles to dust. Outraged, he decides to leave, but discovers that his machine has been dragged into the closed sphinx. Weena follows, telling him Morlocks, who only come out at night, are responsible. A hideous Morlock jumps out and tries to drag her away, but is blinded by George's torch. The next day, Weena shows George domed structures that dot the landscape: air shafts that lead down to the Morlocks' home. She takes him to an ancient museum where \\"talking rings\\" tell of a war in the distant past between east and west that lasted 326 years. The atmosphere became so contaminated that it could no longer be safely breathed. Another ring describes humanity's struggle for survival; many decided to move underground, while some returned to the surface. George realizes this was the beginning of the speciation that resulted in the Morlocks and Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft, but stops when sirens emerge from the sphinx and blare. The Eloi, in a trance-like state, head for the now-open doors at the sphinx's base. The sirens stop and the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside. George enters the caverns and discovers that the Eloi are food for the Morlocks. He finds Weena and fights off the creatures, finally inspiring the Eloi to defend themselves. George sets fires and urges the Eloi to climb back to the surface. He directs them to gather tree branches and drop them down the shafts. The resulting fires cause the caverns to collapse. The next morning, George finds the sphinx's doors open. His time machine is inside. He enters, the doors close, and he is attacked in the dark by Morlocks. He escapes in his machine, sees a Morlock's body decompose rapidly, realizes he's moving forward in time, reverses direction, and returns to 1900. After George recounts his story, his friends remain skeptical. He produces a flower Weena gave him, and Filby, an amateur botanist, says it is of no known species. George bids his guests a good evening. Filby leaves, but returns to find George and his time machine gone. His housekeeper notes that nothing is missing except three books that she cannot identify. When the housekeeper wonders if George will ever return, Filby remarks that \\"he has all the time in the world\\". Cast * Rod Taylor as H.

Unable to sell Hollywood on the concept of the film, he found MGM's British studio (where he had filmed Tom Thumb) open to his proposal. The name of the film's main character (alluded to in dialogue only as \\"George\\") connects him both with George Pal and with the story's original science fiction writer H. G. (George) Wells. The name \\"H. George Wells\\" can be seen on a brass plaque on the time machine. Pal originally considered casting a middle-aged British actor like David Niven or James Mason as George. He later changed his mind and selected the younger Australian actor Rod Taylor to give the character a more athletic, idealistic dimension. It was Taylor's first lead role in a feature film. MGM art director Bill Ferrari designed the time machine. Recognized today as a classic film property, Ferrari's machine suggested a sled made up of a large clockwork rotating disk. The disk rotated at various speeds to indicate movement through time, evoking both a spinning clock and a solar disk. In a meta-concept touch, a brass plate on the time machine's instrument display panel identified its inventor as \\"H. George Wells\\", though the Time Traveler is only, otherwise, referred to as \\"George\\" in the film. The charm of a fantastic technology (time travel), wrapped in the archaic guise of brass, rivets, Art nouveau arabesques, and crystal mechanisms, was an influence on the later emergence of the steampunk genre. With a budget of under $1 million, the film could not be shot in London, where the plot sets the story. Thus, the live-action scenes were filmed from May 25 to June 30, 1959, in Culver City, California, with the backgrounds often filled in by virtue of matte paintings & models. Some of the costumes and set were re-used from Forbidden Planet (1956) such as the Civil Defence air raid officer uniform which was the C-57-D crew uniform and the large acrylic sphere in the talking rings room, a prop from the C-57-D's control bridge. Home media releases Released multiple times on Beta and VHS video cassette, Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED), and both letterboxed and open matte LaserDisc, the film was released on DVD in October 2000 and on Blu-ray Disc in July 2014 from Warner Home Video. Soundtrack An original score CD was released in 1987 produced by Arnold Leibovit, the original soundtrack recording was composed and conducted by Russell Garcia himself. Released by GNP Crescendo. The track listing is as follows: CD cover Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote a mixed review, praising the \\"familiar polish and burnish\\" of the production values but finding that \\"the drama, for all its invention, is creaky and a bit pass√©. (Apparently there has still been no contact with other planets in 800,000 A.D.) And the mood, while delicately wistful, is not so flippant or droll as it might be in a fiction as fanciful and flighty as this one naturally is\\". A generally positive review in Variety praised the special effects as \\"fascinating\\" and wrote that \\"Rod Taylor definitely establishes himself as one of the premium young talents on today's screen\\", but faulted the pacing of the film, finding that \\"things slow down to a walk\\" once the protagonist arrives in the far distant future. Harrison's Reports called the film \\"an excellent science-fiction melodrama ... jammed full of suspense, action and out-of-this-world special effects\\", although the review lamented a lack of comic relief. Whitney Balliett of The New Yorker wrote in a negative review that the film \\"converts this good simple-minded material into bad simple-minded material\\", by including such Hollywood touches as a love interest. He was also unimpressed by the production values, writing that the model sets \\"don't touch the lowest-price Lionel train\\". Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote that with the exception of the \\"gooey\\" love interest, \\"the tale is an engrossing one, boasting adroit camera tricks by Paul C. Vogel and an exceptionally easy, likable performance of the Time Traveler by Taylor. The youngsters will like this, and their elders will be kept wide awake\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film was \\"at its best in the scenes where George explores his new surroundings at each time stop\\", but found the acting \\"inadequate: Rod Taylor lacks both intellect and period sense, belonging more to an American science fiction world, and Weena is just a doll. Nevertheless, Pal's visual flair and genuine feeling for his fantasy world help to maintain an entertaining surface for most of the time\\". The film has a score of 76%, with an average score of 6.94, at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with 28 out of 37 critics giving the film a positive review. Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,610,000 in the United States and Canada and $1 million elsewhere, turning a profit of $245,000. The film had admissions of 363,915 in France.French box office for 1961 at Box Office Story Awards and honors Gene Warren and Tim Baar won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects.

Contact languages also arise between different sign languages, although the term pidgin rather than contact sign is used to describe such phenomena. Contact sign has been characterized as \\"a sign language that has elements of both [a] natural sign language and the surrounding [oral] language\\".Ricento, Thomas. An Introduction to Language Policy: Theory and Method: Volume 1: Language and Social Change, Wiley-Blackwell, 2006, , .  Language contact  Language contact is extremely common in most Deaf communities, which are almost always located within a dominant oral language ('hearing') culture. Deaf people are exposed to the oral language that surrounds them, if only in visual forms like lip reading or writing, from early childhood. Hearing parents and teachers of deaf children, if they sign at all, are usually second language learners, and their signing style will exhibit features of interference from the oral language. A mixing of languages and modes may also occur when interpreting between a spoken and a sign language. While deaf sign languages are distinct from oral languages, with a different vocabulary and grammar, a boundary between the two is often hard to draw. A language 'continuum' is often described between signing with a strong sign-language grammar to signing with a strong spoken- language grammar, the middle-regions of which are often described as contact sign (or Pidgin Sign). In a conversation between a native signer and a second- language learner, both conversation partners may be signing at different ends of the spectrum. A blend that is often seen is vocabulary from the sign language signed in the word order of the oral language, with a simplified or reduced grammar typical of contact languages. However, even a dialogue between two native deaf signers often shows some evidence of language contact. Deaf people in the United States may use a more English-like signing style in a more formal setting, or if unfamiliar with the interlocutor.  Linguistic features of language contact  Sign language researchers Ceil Lucas and Clayton Valli have noted several differences between the language contact arising between two sign languages and the contact phenomena that arise between a signed and an oral language. When two sign languages meet, the expected contact phenomena occurs: lexical borrowing, foreign \\"accent\\", interference, code switching, pidgins, creoles and mixed systems. However, between a sign language and an oral language, lexical borrowing and code switching also occur, but the interface between the oral and signed modes produces unique phenomena: fingerspelling (see below), fingerspelling/sign combination, initialisation, CODA talk (see below), TTY conversation, mouthing, and contact signing. Long-term contact with oral languages has generated a large influence on the vocabulary and grammar of sign languages. Loan translations are common, such as the American Sign Language signs BOY and FRIEND, forming a compound meaning \\"boyfriend\\" or the Auslan partial-calque DON'T MIND, which involves the sign for the noun MIND combined with an upturned palm, which is a typical Auslan negation. When a loan translation becomes fully acceptable and considered as 'native' (rather than Contact Signing) is a matter over which native signers will differ in opinion. The process appears to be very common in those sign languages that have been best documented, such as American Sign Language, British Sign Language and Auslan. In all of the cases, signers are increasingly bilingual in both a sign and a \\"spoken\\" language (or visual forms of it) as the deaf signing community's literacy levels increase. In such bilingual communities, loan translations are common enough that deeper grammatical structures may also be borrowed from the oral language, which is known as metatypy. Malcolm Ross writes: Some populations with a high proportion of deaf people have developed sign languages that are used by both hearing and deaf people in the community, such as Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, Yucatec Maya Sign Language, Adamorobe Sign Language and Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language. It is unclear what kind of language contact phenomena, if any, occur in such environments.  Fingerspelling  One of the most striking contact sign phenomena is fingerspelling in which a writing system is represented with manual signs. In the sign languages with such a system, the manual alphabet is structurally quite different from the more 'native' grammatical forms, which are often spatial, visually motivated, and multilayered. Manual alphabets facilitate the input of new terms such as technical vocabulary from the dominant oral language of the region and allow a transliteration of phrases, names, and places. They may also be used for function words such as 'at', 'so' or 'but'.  Pidgin Sign English  The phrase Pidgin Sign English (PSE, sometimes also 'Pidgin Signed English') is often used to describe the different contact languages that arise between the English language and any of British Sign Language, New Zealand Sign Language, Auslan or American Sign Language. However, that term is falling out of favour.  Reverse phenomenon by children of deaf adults  Contact phenomena have been observed in the reverse direction, from a sign language to an oral language. Hearing adults who grew up in deaf signing households as children of deaf adults (CODAs) sometimes communicate with one another in spoken and written English and knowingly use ASL loan translations and underlying grammatical forms.

The screenplay was adapted (in collaboration with David Zelag Goodman) from a spec script titled Eyes, written by John Carpenter; it was Carpenter's first major studio film. H. B. Gilmour later wrote a novelization. Producer Jon Peters, who was dating Barbra Streisand at the time, bought the screenplay as a starring vehicle for her, but Streisand eventually decided not to take the role because of \\"the kinky nature of the story\\", as Peters later explained. As a result, the role went to Dunaway, who had just won an Oscar for her performance in Network. Streisand nevertheless felt that \\"Prisoner\\", the torch song from the film, would be a good power ballad vehicle for her. She sang it on the soundtrack and garnered a moderate hit as a result (the record peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100). Eyes of Laura Mars is said to be an example of an American version of the Italian giallo genre. The film is also noted for its use of red herrings and its twist ending. Plot Laura Mars (Faye Dunaway) is a glamorous fashion photographer who specializes in stylized violence (based upon the work of Helmut Newton, who provided some of the photos used for the film while others were shot by Rebecca Blake). In the middle of controversy over whether her photographs glorify violence and are demeaning to women, Laura begins seeing, in first person through the eyes of the killer, real-time visions of the murders of her friends and colleagues. John Neville (Tommy Lee Jones), the lieutenant in charge of the case, shows Laura unpublished police photographs of unsolved murders that very closely mirror Laura's fashion shoots. Laura's visions continue, including visions of the killer stalking her and continuing to murder those around her. Meanwhile, Laura and Neville fall in love. The murders continue as Laura's various colleagues, acquaintances and past romantic interests come in and out of focus as potential suspects or victims, until a final confrontation between Laura and the killer occurs. At her apartment, Laura is affected by one last vision of the killer, who has now come for her. The killer attempts to break in through her front door, but Laura deadbolts it before he/she can enter. Upon hearing her distress, Neville (who had been on his way to meet her) breaks through her balcony window. He proceeds to tell Laura they have caught the killer, a troubled colleague of hers named Tommy, and begins an elaborate explanation of Tommy's motivations and back story. Knowing Tommy well, Laura recognizes this as a lie. Neville, still talking about the killer, uses \\"I\\". Laura realizes that Neville is talking about himself and that Neville himself is the killer. As Neville details more of his own story, it is implied that he may have multiple personalities. Because of this, and his love for her, he cannot bring himself to murder her and instead asks that she end his life. He takes her hand, pointing the gun at him as she begs him not to and kills him, calling the police as the camera view closes in on her eyes.

Producer Jack H. Harris had worked with Carpenter on the latter's feature-film directorial debut, Dark Star, and it was Harris who optioned Carpenter's eleven-page treatment, then titled simply Eyes. Harris planned to make the film independently of the major studios with privately raised finance and Roberta Collins in the lead. But Harris's friend Jon Peters read the treatment, and upon reading it, he became enthusiastic about its potential as a vehicle for Peters's then-girlfriend Barbra Streisand. Peters got interest from Peter Guber at Columbia and they agreed to finance the project's development. Streisand pulled out of the film, but Columbia were sufficiently enthusiastic about the script to move forward with another actress and Faye Dunaway was cast. However, as a condition of this, the studio insisted on the script being rewritten; David Zelag Goodman shouldered that burden.Jack H Harris, FATHER OF THE BLOB: The Making Of A Monster Smash & Other Hollywood Tales 2015 \\"It wasn't a pleasant experience\\", said Carpenter. \\"The original script was very good, I thought. But it got shat upon.\\"Trick and Treat McCarthy, Todd. Film Comment; New York Vol. 16, Iss. 1, (Jan/Feb 1980): 17-24. Filming took place over 56 days from October 17, 1977 to early January 1978. The film was shot entirely in New York and New Jersey, with filming locations including New York City, Jersey City, New Jersey, and Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. A sequence where the Laura Mars character photographs a group of models against a backdrop of two burning cars was filmed over four days at New York's Columbus Circle. It was reported that Peters and Dunaway had a tense relationship while making the film. Reception On its release, the film received mixed critical reviews, but it was a box office hit, earning $20 million from a $7 million budget. The movie received a broadly positive review in The New York Times, in which Janet Maslin called the ending of the film \\"dumb\\", but otherwise liked it. She wrote of it: \\"It's the cleverness of Eyes of Laura Mars that counts, cleverness that manifests itself in superlative casting, drily controlled direction from Irvin Kershner, and spectacular settings that turn New York into the kind of eerie, lavish dreamland that could exist only in the idle noodlings of the very, very hip.\\"\\"Screen: 'Eyes of Laura Mars':In The Netherworld\\", Janet Maslin, The New York Times, August 4, 1978 Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic, giving the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and criticizing what he called the film's clich√©d \\"woman in trouble\\" plot. As of April 2020, the film has an approval rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.22/10. The site's critics' consensus: \\"Eyes of Laura Mars hints at interesting possibilities, but they're frittered away by a predictable story that settles for superficial thrills.\\" George Lucas hired director Kershner for The Empire Strikes Back because he was very impressed after seeing an early rough cut of the film. A parody of the film titled Eyes of Lurid Mess was published in Mad Magazine. It was illustrated by Angelo Torres and written by Larry Siegel in regular issue #206, April 1979.MAD Cover Site, MAD #206 April 1979. Soundtrack Eyes of Laura Mars (Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released by Columbia Records (PS 35487) in July 1978. It was produced by Gary Klein with executive producers Jon Peters and Charles Koppelman. Mark Iskowitz of The Barbra Streisand Music Guide wrote: \\"The side one 'Prisoner' track is actually identical to the single and Greatest Hits Volume 2 version. The side two reprise version does contain instrumentation from the film score at the beginning and during the first sections of the song, which is featured in its entirety.

His current assignment is 60 Minutes and CBS News' Election specials. Most recently, he was co-host of CBS This Morning along with Norah O'Donnell and Gayle King. He served as an interim anchor of the CBS Evening News until Norah O'Donnell took over in the summer of 2019. Previously he was the host of Face the Nation on CBS News, the political director of CBS News, chief Washington correspondent for CBS News, and a political columnist for Slate magazine. Before hosting Face the Nation, he was the longtime chief political correspondent at Slate. Before joining Slate, Dickerson covered politics at Time magazine for 12 years, serving the last four years as its White House correspondent.  Early life A native of Washington, D.C., Dickerson is the son of Claude Wyatt Dickerson and journalist Nancy Dickerson (n√©e Hanschman; later Whitehead). He has three sisters and one brother. He grew up in McLean, Virginia, at Merrywood, a Georgian-style mansion high on a leafy bluff overlooking the Potomac River. Dickerson graduated from Sidwell Friends School in 1987 and holds a degree in English with distinction from the University of Virginia. Career On Her Trail, Dickerson's book about his relationship with his late mother Nancy Dickerson Whitehead, a pioneering television newswoman, was published by Simon & Schuster in 2006. In a Washington Post review, staff writer Elsa Walsh called the book \\"riveting\\".Elsa Walsh, \\"My Mother: On Her Trail,\\" The Washington Post, October 17, 2006. Before joining Slate, Dickerson covered politics at Time magazine for 12 years, serving the last four years as its White House correspondent. Dickerson hosted Face the Nation three times in 2009 and was appointed Political Director of CBS News in November 2011. He appeared each Wednesday on The Al Franken Show on Air America Radio, until the show ended in 2007, and was also a frequent guest on NPR's Day to Day. He appears on PBS's Washington Week and the Slate Political Gabfest, a weekly podcast with David Plotz and Emily Bazelon. Dickerson is also the host of Whistlestop, a Slate podcast about presidential history. Dickerson took over as host of Face the Nation on June 7, 2015. He served as host for 2 1/2 years until signing off on January 21, 2018. Shortly after this, Dickerson was named the new co-anchor of CBS This Morning. He is the author of, most recently, The Hardest Job in the World: The American Presidency. Publishers Weekly described it as an ‚Äúevenhanded and insightful look at the evolution of the American presidency.‚Äù He is also the author of Whistlestop: My Favorite Stories from Presidential Campaign History, published by Twelve, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, on August 2, 2016. In November 2018, John Dickerson contributed a few educational videos to the Khan Academy during the 2018 midterm elections. On May 10, 2019, CBS News President Susan Zirinsky said that Dickerson will fill in for a week (week of May 13, 2019) on the CBS Evening News after current anchor Jeff Glor stepped down. Glor was replaced by Norah O'Donnell on July 15, 2019. CBS News used a rotating series of anchors to staff the broadcast until O'Donnell takes over, Zirinsky said.

CIA leak case  Dickerson co-wrote a July 17, 2003, Time article, \\"A War on Wilson?\\", which attributed the leak of Valerie Plame's CIA identity to senior Bush administration officials. Writing for Slate in February 2006 (\\"Where's My Subpoena?\\"), Dickerson speculated about why Patrick Fitzgerald never called him as a grand jury witness for his \\"bit role\\" in the drama.\\"Where's My Subpoena? Valerie Plame, Scooter Libby, and Me\\", Slate, February 7, 2006.

Another reporter, Tamara Lipper of Newsweek, reportedly walked away before he spoke of Plame. Dickerson has disputed Fleischer's account, claiming that Fleischer urged him to look into who sent Wilson but that he did not mention Plame's name or CIA identity. In a second trial dispatch on the matter, Dickerson revealed a previously- undisclosed excerpt from his email that July afternoon which he said corroborated his account: \\"On background WH officials were dissing Wilson. They suggested he was sent on his mission by a low-level person at the agency.\\"John Dickerson Slate article on Cooper testimony Neither Lipper nor Gregory has commented publicly about what Fleischer told them. On January 31, 2007, former Time reporter Matthew Cooper testified that Dickerson's Africa sources contributed information to the article \\"A War on Wilson?\\" In addition to Ari Fleischer, Dickerson also spoke to White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett while in Africa.  Style  The Washington Post once wrote about his style of asking questions: \\"The master of the game is John Dickerson of Time magazine, who has knocked Bush off script so many times that his colleagues have coined a term for cleverly worded, seemingly harmless, but incisive questions: 'Dickersonian.'\\" :Dickerson (during April 13, 2004 press conference): \\"In the last campaign, you were asked a question about the biggest mistake you'd made in your life, and you used to like to joke that it was trading Sammy Sosa.

On several occasions, if a participant did not agree to a bet, the host would ask if someone else in the audience would do it for a \\"Stolen Bet\\" of the same amount of money offered to the original participant. Several segments were shown per episode, the end of which usually showed the contestant saying \\"I Bet You Will...\\" followed by the name of the stunt or the thing the contestant had to do. Dares Dares used on I Bet You Will included the following: * Eating or drinking a concoction of gross items or rotten food a la Fear Factor (cod liver oil was a staple of the show) * Enduring public humiliation for a fixed period of time, usually involving being covered in a disgusting substance and/or being stripped to nearly naked (such as having to wear a thong with udders, getting painted as a cow, and eating wheat grass) * Having unusual things done to one's hair or body (for example, getting a mullet or having one eyebrow shaved off) * Having a prized possession (such as a wallet, university degree or car) damaged, destroyed, or otherwise irreplaceably taken away - this was sometimes paired with a stunt which if lost meant that the player lost the possession and got nothing in return * Having one's money shredded, placed in a bowl, and mixed with a gross food, which the contestant then had to eat for a bigger payoff * Being blindfolded while receiving tattoos of someone else's choice anywhere on the body * Being waxed in public * Sitting totally nude in public and let random people pour anything they wanted on you *Letting random people on the street take super industrial permanent markers and color your feet including between your toes and soles completely with it up to your belly button and everything in between * Asking for wedgies and getting paid a fixed amount per wedgie * Rolling dice, spinning a wheel, or grabbing a rubber duckie andg the stunt on a fixed bet * Getting someone to stomp guacamole with their feet and having someone else lick it off Occasionally, bonuses were offered if a player could complete or endure a second dare while performing the first one; failure to complete such a dare sometimes caused the player to fail the first one and lose everything. The host also occasionally offered to double the bet on the condition that the contestant ate two or three more things, performed a dare naked or allowed his or her best friend to aid in the humiliation.

Cha was considered to be an avant-garde artist. Cha was fluent in Korean, English, and French. In her works, such as Dictee, Cha took language apart and experimented with it in her writing. Cha's interdisciplinary background was clearly evident in Dictee, which experiments with juxtaposition and hypertext of both print and visual media. Cha's Dictee is taught in contemporary literature classes including women's literature. Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's novel Dictee was published in 1982. She was murdered on November 5, 1982, a week after her novel was published. Early life Cha, a Korean American, was born in Busan, South Korea during the Korean War. She was the middle child of five to Hyung Sang and Hyung Soon Cha. Both of her parents were teachers. Her mother and oldest brother left Korea for Hawaii when Cha was young, in 1962. The rest of her family eventually moved to the United States in 1963, temporarily settling in Hawaii. A year later, in 1964, Cha's family relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco. During her time at Sacred Heart High School, Cha studied French. Cha was fluent in French, English and Korean. Education Theresa Hak Kyung Cha attended a private Catholic high school, Convent of the Sacred Heart High School, in San Francisco. At this school Cha studied Western classics and language. She also studied French, Greek, and Roman classics. During her time at Sacred Heart, she sang in the choir. It is thought that Cha's time at Sacred Heart inspired Dictee. By the time she graduated Cha had earned many scholastic awards. Before committing to Berkeley, Cha attended University of San Francisco for one semester. She transferred to University of California, Berkeley the following year, where she completed her studies in art and writing. There, she also studied ceramics with Peter Voulkos and James Melchert, who encouraged her to work in performance. As a student, she became close friends with Dennis Love, another student, and Bertrand Augst, a professor of French and comparative literature. Her classes with Augst inspired Cha to study comparative literature, in which she later earned degrees. Teachers and friends have stated that Cha enjoyed reading broadly, anything from Korean poetry to European modernist and postmodern literature. Cha received her B.A. in comparative literature in 1973 and a B.A. in art in 1975, both from Berkeley. She worked as a student employee of the Pacific Film Archive for three years between 1974 and 1977 while earning two graduate degrees in art (M.A., 1977; M.F.A., 1978). As a graduate student, she became close friends with Mechert and even became his teaching assistant in 1976. During this time, Cha connected with fellow artists Stephen Laub, Reese Williams, Young Soon Min, and Mark Thompson. As Cha's interest in film grew, she studied at Berkeley under Bertrand Augst, who recalls her interest in poetry written by St√©phane Mallarm√© and plays by Samuel Beckett. According to Augst, Cha felt an affinity with Mallarm√©'s associative and restrained use of language. It is likely these artists introduced her to unconventional typographic design which become a constant feature of her works. Beckett's highly reductive style of theater found echoes in the spare setting of Cha's performances. More than the stylistic influence of Beckett or Mallarm√©, Cha's studies of film theory with Augst had perhaps the greatest effect on her development. Augst taught his students structural and semiological film analysis, frequently using an Athena projector, which can slow a film to a single frame. This frame-by-frame study greatly inspired Cha's own films and use of video stills. In 1976 Cha decided to pursue a degree in film theory at the UC Education Abroad Program, Centre d'Etudes Americain du Cinema, in Paris. During her stay she studied under Jean-Louis Baudry, Raymond Bellour, Monique Wittig, and Christian Metz. Career and personal life Mario Ciampi designed the building (completed in 1970) that was the former home of the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA) on Bancroft Way in Berkeley, California, where Cha worked while attending graduate school. Cha's estate donated her works to BAMPFA in 1991. Cha began her career as a performance artist, producer, director, and writer in 1974. She also worked as an usher and cashier from 1974 to 1977 at the Pacific Film Archive, with friends. In 1979 Cha traveled back to Korea for the first time in seventeen years. She had long expressed great anticipation to return in her book Exil√©e, where she describes the flight in terms of the sixteen time zones that separate San Francisco from Seoul. It was a sorrowful but memorable trip. The excitement of finally returning to her homeland was diminished by the cool reception she received from her own people, to whom she was just another foreigner. \\"...she visited Korea with her brother in the midst of massive student demonstrations, only to learn that she was a stranger at home.\\" Cha performed \\"Other Things Seen, Other Things Heard\\" at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1979, attracting the attention of Robert Atkins, art critic for the San Francisco Bay Guardian. In August 1980, Cha moved to New York City, working as an editor and writer for Tanam Press. Earlier that year, she also traveled to Japan and then back to Korea, this time working on the film White Dust From Mongolia from May to July 1980 with her brother. They were never able to finish the film due to the dangerous political situation in Korea at the time. South Korea President Park Chung Hee had just been assassinated that previous May and restrictive new laws had been declared. Cha and her brother were harassed by South Korean officials who thought they might be North Korean spies. In 1981, Cha began teaching video art at Elizabeth Seton College while working in the design department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was awarded an artist's residence at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1982. While some authors have described Cha's character as ambitious and disciplined, others have described her as undisciplined, tragic, pure, and intelligent. Cha married the photographer Richard Barnes in May 1982; the two had met in a drawing class in 1975, during her time at UC Berkeley. Style =Themes= From 1910 to 1945, the Korean language was forbidden to be communicated in Korea under Japanese rule. Cha linked her own process of learning language - whether that be in her Korean first language, English, French or Latin - to the extraordinary cultural oppression experienced in Korea during this nearly 40-year period.Rinder, Lawrence R. \\"The Plurality of Entrances, the Opening of Networks, the Infinity of Languages\\" (2001) from The Dream of the Audience: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (1951 - 1982) (ed. Lewallen, Constance M.). University of California Press. In the body of Cha's art, language functions as fluid binary systems of contemporaneous displacement and reunification, repression and freedom, detachment and engagement, and the ineffable and communication. The main body of Cha's work is \\"looking for the roots of language before it is born on the tip of the tongue\\". Much of Cha's work demonstrates an interaction and interplay between languages with her primary focus on \\"grammatical structures of a language, syntax, how words and meaning are _constructed_ in the language system itself, by function or usage, and how transformation is brought about through manipulation, processes as changing the syntax, isolation, removing from context, repetition, and reduction to minimal units\\". Since language unified Cha's aesthetic approach, establishing an intimate dialogue with the audience was a deliberate consideration in her art. The audience held a \\"privileged place in that She/He is the receptor and or activator central to an exchange or dialogue\\". For Cha, the audience is the \\"Other\\" whose presence establishes, or completes, any form of communication. As she writes in \\"audience distant relative\\": There was no firm delineation between Cha's visual and linguistic approaches to literature and art. Her visual and performance work often involved words and letters manipulated such as changing the sizes and placement of letters. These words are often imposed on or near images as a form of communication, another theme in Cha's work. Dictee features heavily French language and English, along with others, often together on the same page. Commonly the languages are used in repetitive, \\"broken\\" phrases and frequent code-switching, similar to the communication of an individual learning the languages. According to Hyun Yi Kang, this style causes readers to \\"[reconsider] the arbitrary and ideologically colored prescriptions on language and writing, challenging the requirements of good speech and correct grammar.\\" Other common themes in Cha's work include diaspora, the mother tongue, and the narrative device of stream of consciousness. = Influences = Cha was influenced by a variety of sources. Her friends say that she was inspired by the art activity around her, but there has been little analysis of this aspect of her development as an artist. Cha was inspired by artist Terry Fox, a fellow artist and performer. She met him in 1973, during one of his solo exhibitions at the UAM, now Art, Design & Architecture Museum at UCSB. Cha came to his performances and watched Fox and his brother Larry interact with various materials and objects, such as metal and a mirror. Fox's exhibit involved a variety of media and formats, including performance, sculpture, and drawing. Cha drew her inspiration from Fox's slow, ritualistic performances. The translucent veil employed by Fox to demarcate and isolate his performance space was a device Cha used in her performances ‚Ä≥A Ble Wail‚Ä≥ (1975) and Pause Still (1979; performed with her sister Bernadette). Cha also used props‚Äîcandles, bamboo sticks, flour‚Äîin some of her performance, which Fox had previously used in his own. Cha and Fox have been compared in similar slow, deliberate, almost trance-like paces they employed in their performance work. Fox had witnessed a few of Cha's performances and commented on the way she moved in the space, barefoot, not making a sound. During her time as an usher Cha became interested in the work of Marguerite Duras, Jean- Luc Godard, Alain Resnais, Yasujir≈ç Ozu, and many other film theorists and artists. Carl Dreyer was a particularly recurrent influence, particularly his film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), which was quoted in Cha's super-8 and video installation Exil√©e (1980) among other instances in her work. In the visual arts, her work has been included in the expanded account of conceptual art initiated by the exhibition Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin, 1950s‚Äì1980s, in addition her work usually features in the San Francisco Bay- area accounts of conceptual art, the dates of which are later than the East Coast accounts. Lawrence Rinder notes that San Francisco Bay-area conceptualism of the 1970s also ‚Äòtended to invest conceptual forms with personal and physical qualities.‚Äô  Death  On November 5, 1982, Cha was raped and murdered by security guard and serial rapist Joey Sanza in New York City, in The Puck Building on Lafayette Street in lower Manhattan. She had gone there to meet Barnes, who was documenting the renovation of the building. She died a week after the publication of Dictee. Sanza, who was already imprisoned in Florida for 12 counts of sexual battery committed between January and June 1982 when he was indicted for the rape and murder of Cha in 1983, was convicted on those charges in 1987 after the third trial. Shortly before her death, Cha was working on an artistic piece for a group show at Artists Space in SoHo. The Artists Space exhibit later became a memorial for Cha after her death by exhibiting images and text from Dictee. Additional work left incomplete at the time of her death included another film, a book, a critique of advertising, and a piece on the representation of hands in Western painting. Legacy In 1991, nine years following Cha's murder, her brother and director of the Theresa Hak Kyung Cha Memorial Foundation, John Cha, asked if the University of California Berkeley Art Museum would be able to set up safe-keeping of Cha's videos, artwork, and archives. The gift was accepted by the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA) in 1992. Some of Cha's work is available through the Electronic Arts Intermix (EAI). Today Dictee is widely studied in contemporary literature classes, including classes on avant-garde writing, feminist literature, and Asian American literature. Elvan Zabunyan wrote the first monograph of Cha's work and published it in 2013. =Exhibitions= Cha's first professional exhibition was part of a group show in 1980 at the San Francisco Art Institute Annual. A posthumous showing of Cha's work was organized by her friend Judith Barry and exhibited at Artists Space a month after her death. Her first solo exhibition was held at the Whitney Museum in 1993 with little publicity. Catalogued in the book of the same name, an exhibition of Cha's work entitled The Dream of the Audience: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (1951-1982) was organized and shown in 2001 at the University of California Berkeley Art Museum by senior curator Constance Lewallen. This exhibition, building off the work of two previously organized by former curator Lawrence Rinder, aimed to display lesser known work by Cha including other published works, videos, performances, works on paper, and mail art. The exhibit later went on tour, including stops in Irvine (Beall Center for Art and Technology), New York City (Bronx Museum of the Arts), Illinois (Krannert Art Museum), and Seattle (Henry Art Gallery), with a final stop in Seoul. The exhibition continued to Vienna (Generali Foundation) and Barcelona (Fundaci√≥ Antoni T√†pies). Cha's work was exhibited again in Paris (group exhibition Fais un effort pour te souvenir. Ou, √† d√©faut, invente., at the ) and London (A Portrait in Fragments, sponsored and hosted by The Korean Cultural Centre UK; and with a showing of her films at the Institute of Contemporary Arts) in 2013. In 2018, BAMPFA staged an exhibition based on Cha's book Dictee entitled Theresa Hak Kyung Cha: Avant Dictee, organized by assistant curator Stephanie Cannizzo. The Cleveland Museum of Art also staged Cha's video work in a show entitled Theresa Hak Kyung Cha: Displacements in 2018.

It was created in 1998 during the amalgamation of several other communities in the northern section of Perth County, and the previously incorporated Town of Listowel dissolved with the creation of the Municipality of North Perth. Its population was 7,530 at the Canada 2016 Census in a land area of 6.65 square kilometres; at the time there were 3,159 occupied dwellings. \\"Listowel 2016 Census\\". Statistics Canada History =Settlement and early years= Settler John Binning Purcell arrived in 1852 and was the first to create a permanent residence in the area. Within four years a sawmill and a settlement called Mapleton developed. On June 1, 1856, the name was changed when the post office named Listowel was opened; the population was 200 and a tavern and a general store were already operating. The new name is based on Listowel, Ireland. The majority of early settlers were of Protestant Irish origin. By 1866, the population had increased to 800 and the settlement became an incorporated Village. The first Reeve (1867‚Äì72) was D. D. Hay. By 1871 gravel roads extended in several directions, to Mitchell and to Stratford, but were not adequate for moving products to distant markets. That year a by-law to provide financial aid to expanding a railroad was passed. =Economic expansion= In 1871 the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway extended its line to Listowel. It was joined in 1873 by a second railway, the Stratford and Huron Railway, and Listowel soon became an important shipping point. The arrival of the railway hastened development and Listowel became a Town with a population of 2,054 in 1875 in what is now North Perth in Perth County, Ontario. In 1877, the first elementary school opened; two years later the first high school is opened. In 1880 a gas company was organized, and began supplying lighting to the residents. The Morris, Field, Rogers Company Ltd began to manufacture Morris pianos in Listowel; within a few years it was employing 80 to 100 people. That year an old tannery was expanded into Breithaupt Leather Company. Three years later a manufacturer of agricultural implements opened. Electricity came to Listowel in 1897, and in 1900 the Listowel Furniture Company opened. By 1902 the population had increased to 2,661, and a woolen mill, a planing mill, a flour mill, a brewery and a dairy products exporting company were operating in the town. =Recent history= On February 28, 1959, the Listowel Memorial Arena collapsed, burying a boys' hockey team playing a scrimmage game ‚Äì the worst tragedy in the town's history. Seven young players, along with a referee and recreation director (Reginald Kenneth McLeod), were killed in the tragic collapse.\\"Community bids farewell to Listowel Memorial Arena\\". Dec 13, 2017 by Dan McNee Listowel Banner On March 17, 2011, the local dollar store caught fire and its roof collapsed, killing volunteer firefighters Ray Walter (30) and Ken Rea (56). Listowel mourned the tragic loss, closing major streets and posting black ribbons all over town in honour of the fallen firefighters. Paddyfest festivities continued to honour Kinsman Ray Walter, but in a somber fashion. A community funeral service was held March 24, 2011 at the Listowel Memorial Arena, with a broadcast directly to Elma Community Centre. Over 10,000 were expected to visit Listowel that day and Premier Dalton McGuinty joined emergency responders from across the country to attend the funeral service. A minute of silence was held at the Ontario Legislature earlier in the week and flags were flown at half mast. Firefighters from London, Ontario and Kitchener, Ontario came to help staff the local fire stations so all North Perth firefighters could attend the service. The accident marked the first double firefighter fatality in Ontario since 1978. The Steve Kerr Memorial Complex, a new sports complex and community centre, was opened in late 2018. Education Public education in Listowel is administered by the Avon Maitland District School Board, who manage Listowel District Secondary School and elementary schools Listowel Eastdale Public School and North Perth Westfield Elementary School. North Perth Westfield Elementary School, an amalgamation of Wallace Public School and Listowel Central School, accepted its first cohort of students in September 2016.Avon Maitland Schools Catholic education is managed by the Huron-Perth Catholic District School Board, who have St. Mary's Catholic Elementary School in town. Culture The region is home to many visual artists who are showcased annually as part of the region's Studio Tour. Theatre 311 is a venue for live theatre, drawing on local talent and actors from surrounding cities. Listowel is also represented in the film industry by Dura Mater Productions, an independent film company that has received recognition by film festivals throughout North America and Europe. The Bookery (now the Salvation Army Thrift Store) is located across from Veky's International Cuisine Restaurant. This Celtic-inspired book store stocks about 25,000 books and traditional Celtic, Irish and Scottish jewellery in silver. In addition, they provide gallery space for local artists to display their work. Listowel has also raised musicians from many genres, such as Thirteen O'Clock, Brian Vollmer (lead singer of Helix), Ian Laing, The Bender singers, and In the vein of classical music, the Grammy Award-winning baritone, Kevin McMillan, is from Listowel. =Paddyfest= Listowel has a large Irish festival, called Paddyfest, which is held over the two weeks surrounding St. Patrick's Day. The festival was first started in 1977 from an idea put forth by Dave Murtha to honour the large numbers of persons of Irish ancestry present in the Listowel area and is largely maintained by the Kinsmen and Kinette clubs of Listowel. The official spokesperson for Paddyfest is chosen yearly in the Paddyfest Ambassador Competition. Contestants must perform a speech, impromptu question and interview with the judges and receive the overall highest score to be awarded this position. A separate award of Talent is given out to the contestant with the highest score in the talent competition. Runner-up and Congeniality are also awards which are available. The Paddyfest Ambassador Competition changed its name and official status from being Miss Paddyfest when first created.\\"Brennan crowned 2018 Paddyfest Ambassador\\".

The Campbell Soup Company was a major local employer for 48 years, operating a frozen, foodservice and specialty food plant in Listowel. This relationship ended abruptly with the announcement of the factory's pending closure on April 28, 2008. In 2010 the former Campbell Soup plant was purchased by Erie Meat Products and expected to ship 50-60 million pounds of poultry to world markets on an annual basis. Since 1996 the area around Listowel has attracted new industries, including Listowel Technology, Inc. a manufacturer of injection- moulded automotive parts with a 240,000-square-foot facility employing 500. In 2012, EFS plastics constructed a 40,000 square foot plant in the North Perth Industrial Park. Other businesses in the park include Vision Manufacturing Solutions, Hutchison Precision Inc., Shredall and Energrow. HLA/Horst Welding completed a new 64,000 square foot metal fabrication facility in 2016.

Unlike traditional hot-air balloons, where a single large balloon is equipped with vents enabling altitude control, cluster balloons are multiple, small, readily available and individually sealed balloons. To control flight, arrest a climb or initiate a descent, the pilot incrementally jettisons or deflates balloons. Ballast, e.g., bottled water, can also be jettisoned to facilitate ascent. Famous balloonists In the Lawnchair Larry flight, Larry Walters, without any prior ballooning experience, attached 42 helium-filled weather balloons to a lawn chair and lifted off in 1982. In defending against charges later filed against him by the FAA, he stated that he intended to rise just a few hundred feet (about 100 metres), but underestimated helium's lifting power, causing his tethering strap to break prematurely. Walters quickly rose to nearly , over 50 times his intended maximum altitude. Walters reportedly had planned to control his altitude by using a pellet gun to selectively pop some of the balloons. However, he was initially hesitant to shoot any balloons, as he was concerned about falling out due to a loss of stability. Reaching a high altitude and seeing no other way of getting down, he eventually shot several of the balloons, initiating his descent. John Ninomiya's flights have been featured on The Science Channel, The History Channel, TechTV, TLC, and MTV. The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the highest altitude attained via cluster ballooning to be that achieved by Mike Howard (UK) and Steve Davis (USA), who on August 4, 2001, over Los Lunas, NM, USA, used 400 helium balloons to reach a height of over . Larry Walters is estimated to have reached in 1982. His record is not recognized, however, because he did not carry a proper altimeter.Snopes.com , Up, Up, and Away! On June 8, 2013 Joe Barbera, of La Center, WA launched a lawn chair with cluster balloons and recorded a new altitude record of . This is a pending world record being considered by Guinness Book of World Recordshttps://www.facebook.com/lawnchairpilots?hc_location=timeline Yoshikazu Suzuki departed from Lake Biwa in Japan on 23 November 1992 with 23 helium balloons. He was spotted by a Japanese coast guard aeroplane on 25 November 1992, located about 800 km offshore over the Pacific Ocean, at altitude between 2,500 and 4,000 m, and was never seen again. In April 2008, in Brazil, Roman Catholic priest Adelir Antonio de Carli ascended with 1000 balloons. Ground observers lost track of him when he floated out above the ocean, and he was missing until part of his body was recovered by an offshore oil rig support vessel on 5 July 2008. Carli at one point reached an altitude of 6,000 metres (19,685 ft) before losing contact with authorities; his altitude may have indeed been the record for cluster ballooning, but it cost him his life. Just two months later, in June 2008, FAA licensed pilot Jonathan Trappe attached a cluster of balloons to his standard, unmodified office chair and flew it to an altitude of 14,783 feet. The flight reportedly lasted four hours and covered 50 miles before Trappe returned to earth, retired the chair, and returned it back to his workplace.ClusterBalloon.com, Chairway to Heaven On May 28, 2010, Sky News reported on Trappe's crossing of the English Channel by cluster balloon. Trappe departed near Challock, England, crossed over the White Cliffs of Dover at St. Margarets Bay, and made landfall again over Dunkirk, France. Trappe then tracked inland, and landed safely in a farmer's cabbage patch.Balloon Daredevil Floats Over English Channel , news.sky.com. Three years later, Trappe attempted a trans-Atlantic crossing, but his journey stopped short when he was forced to land in Newfoundland. On September 2, 2020, David Blaine reached 24,900 feet via helium-filled balloons. He carried an oxygen supply. He released himself from the balloons. His parachute automatically opened at 7,000 feet. Other applications Smaller balloon clusters consisting of several toy balloons are sometimes used for creating flying light effects by using them as a carrier for lightsticks or other small light sources. They can be also used for other amateur scientific experiments, such as making aerial photographs or atmospheric measurements. Such toy balloons, with or without helium filling, are more readily available than bigger balloons.

GLEAM originated as a private mailing list during the 1980s. Members of the list successfully campaigned for sexual orientation to be added to Microsoft's anti-discrimination policy in 1989. In 1997, group leaders pointed out that anti-gay actions had occurred, but \\"overt bias is extremely rare.\\" GLEAM also lobbied for Microsoft to offer insurance and other benefits to same-sex domestic partners. Lobbying intensified after Lotus software offered these benefits to its workers. Microsoft added this benefit in 1993. GLEAM became more formally organized in 1993 under Microsoft's Diversity Advisory Council, along with Blacks at Microsoft (BAM), the women's group ‚Äì known as Hoppers ‚Äì and other similar groups. More recently, the group influenced Microsoft to add gender identity and expression to its anti-discrimination policies in April 2005 and, in 2006, to progressively extend health coverage benefits to cover transgender care. Since this time, the Human Rights Campaign has Microsoft's Corporate Equality Index rating ‚Äì a set of metrics to measure a company's compliance with its goals of gender identity neutrality in the workplace ‚Äì to 100%. In 2020, Microsoft employees plan to march in more than 60 cities around the world. Washington state gay rights legislation GLEAM also pushed to secure Microsoft's support of gay rights legislation in Washington state. During legislative hearings on Washington's H.B. 1515 bill, which would extend the state's current anti-discrimination laws to people with alternate sexual orientations, two Microsoft employees testified as private citizens on behalf of the legislation. A conservative religious group took this to mean Microsoft was actively supporting the legislation as an organization and demanded the company reverse its support. In an April 22, 2005 e-mail, company CEO Steve Ballmer explained to Microsoft employees that earlier in the year, the company had decided to focus its lobbying efforts on issues more directly related to its core business (e.g., computer privacy). In the same e-mail, he affirmed the company's commitment to diversity and encouraged individual shareholders to get involved in the issue, but said that no one on either side should represent themselves as speaking for the company. In response, seven days later, the GLEAM board of directors sent an e-mail that proposed, with specific timelines, various steps that Microsoft should take in order to repair its public image and the \\"lack of trust\\" created by the Ballmer e-mail on April 22. Among the proposals was that Microsoft should acknowledge its neutral position was a mistake (including a proposed press release and a seven-day suggested timeframe for the dissemination of the release) and partner with GLEAM as \\"subject matter experts\\" in reaching out to the LGBT community, beginning with a sixty-day \\"intense outreach\\" period. Meanwhile, a petition of employees asking Microsoft to support the bill topped 1700 signatures. The bill was passed in the subsequent legislative session (2006) under the leadership of gay legislator, Rep. Ed Murray (D) of the 43rd legislative district and after the defection of Republican State Senator, Bill Finkbeiner, who subsequently retired and whose seat was captured by Democrat and Microsoft alumnus, Eric Oemig. During the 2006 elections, voters of the 43rd legislative district also elevated Rep. Ed Murray to the Washington State Senate. On September 15, 2009, Microsoft publicly announced its support for Referendum 71 to protect Washington State Domestic Partnerships.

Penny wrote more than 30 plays and 300 poems. Early life Penny was born in Opelika, Alabama, on August 6, 1941. He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Hill District as a toddler, where he was raised. A 1957 graduate of Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Penny had childhood aspirations of joining the priesthood. Academic life Penny was in the first cohort of Black Studies faculty hired in 1968 by Co-directors of the University of Pittsburgh's new Black Studies Program, Jack L. Daniel, Ph.D. and Curtiss E. Porter. Porter and Daniel sought to develop a faculty representative of both academia and community. Porter, in particular, himself a creative, drew on Penny's established reputation as a \\"straight ahead\\" poet, fusing the incantations of Bebop jazz and street lyricism into hard hitting graphic, terse poetics that spoke to street life. Emanating from Pittsburgh's fabled Hill District creative arts core, he was a lead voice of The Centre Ave Poets Writer's Workshop, which included others such as Charlie Williams, Nick Flournoy and August Wilson, who would achieve later fame as America's premier African American playwright. Many considered Penny to be Wilson's mentor in those early days. Penny's hire, along with other non-traditionalists academics, such as the choreographer Bob Johnson were part of the push to infuse the Black Studies curriculum with a wholistic Black Aesthetic to correspond to an advanced exploration of Black academics that Porter, in particular, thought should comprise Black Studies. After Penny began teaching at the University of Pittsburgh , he was promoted to associate professor in 1971 under the leadership of Porter. His tenure established a foothold for the increased production of his art. Penny, moved on to serve as chair of its Africana Studies Department from 1978 to 1984 after Porter's resignation from the Chairmanship. Penny was also a founding member of the Africana Studies Department. Theatrical contributions In 1968, he and his friend August Wilson, a fellow Pittsburgh poet and playwright, were approached by members of Pitt's Black Action Society (BAS), Curtiss E. Porter, Anthony\\"Tony\\" Fountain,E. Philip McKain, who had recently obtained funding, to establish the Black Horizons Theater, which staged performances until the mid-1970s. Dr. Vernell A. Lillie founded the Kuntu Repertory Theatre in 1975 as a way of showcasing Penny's plays. Penny was the playwright-in-residence for the Kuntu Repertory Theatre. Today, the theatre continues to hold performances of Rob's plays. In 1976, he and Wilson co-founded the Kuntu Writers Workshop, which Penny coordinated until his death on March 16, 2003. The Pittsburgh City Council honored Penny by presenting the Penny family with a key to the City of Pittsburgh for his commitment to social activism, dedication to encouraging youth, and contributions to the greater Hill District community.

Umar accepted Suharto's decision to assume command of the Army and supported him in his efforts to crack down on the attempted coup. Towards midday, Umar received a summon from President Sukarno who was suspiciously at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, the place where the six Generals were taken. Suharto was worried that this was an attempt to get Umar to Halim and have him killed. Suharto firmly rejected the order. As Suharto retook control of the situation in Jakarta, Umar further consolidated it. He declared a curfew between 6 pm and 6 am and placed watch on all of the city's newspapers. When blame for the incident was beginning to be put on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), Umar approved of the formation of Union of Action To Exterminate The 30 September Movement (KAP-GESTAPU), leading to the mass killing of an estimated half a million people in 1965‚Äì1966. =New Order= Umar Wirahadikusumah as the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army Although he was not part of Suharto's inner circle, Umar won great trust from Suharto for the assistance and support given in putting down G30S. As Suharto began a rise which would see him end up as President of Indonesia, Umar's career also skyrocketed. In 1965, Suharto entrusted Umar to replace him as Commanderof Kostrad. In 1967, Umar became Deputy Army Chief of Staff before finally becoming the Army Chief of Staff himself in 1969. In 1973, his active military career came to an end and he became the Chairman of the State Audit Board (BPK), a position which he would hold for 10 years. As Chairman of BPK, Umar was responsible for making sure that Government Departments, Ministries, and Agencies were using their money properly. During his tenure as Chairman of BPK, Umar made the grim assessment that not even one Government department was free from corruption. Vice Presidency Other version of Umar's official VP portrait In March 1983, Umar reached the pinnacle of his career. Suharto, who had been elected for a 4th term as President by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) selected Umar to be his Vice President. This was considered to be a rather unexpected choice as Umar's stature in Indonesian politics paled in comparison compared to his two predecessors, Hamengkubuwono IX and Adam Malik. Despite being a low-key personality, Umar had a good reputation and was widely respected. As Vice President, Umar became one of the very few in the Suharto regime who chose to combat corruption. As a religious man, Umar had hoped that religion can be used to turn corruptors to do the right deeds. Umar also conducted surprise inspections (sometimes incognito) to regional towns and villages to monitor how Government policies were affecting the People. During his Vice Presidency, Umar also held prayer services at the Vice Presidential Palace. Umar's term as Vice President ended in March 1988 when he was replaced by Sudharmono. Many were disappointed to see him not continue for a second term as Vice President. It was a testament to his good reputation that Sudharmono wanted to be sure of Umar's acceptance to not continuing as Vice President for another term. Post Vice Presidency In May 1998, on the eve of Suharto's fall, Umar, together with Sudharmono and Try Sutrisno visited Suharto at his residence to discuss possible options. Death Umar died on 21 March 2003 due to heart and lung problems at 7:53 pm. at the Central Army Hospital (RSPAD) Gatot Subroto. Then the body was interred at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, Jakarta. Family Umar married Karlinah Djaja Atmadja on 2 February 1957, with whom he had two daughters. Miscellaneous Umar Wirahadikusumah was the uncle of Agus Wirahadikusumah, a reformist military officer who himself became Commander of Kostrad.

Tyndale House is a Christian publisher in Carol Stream, Illinois.  History  It was founded in 1962 by Kenneth N. Taylor in order to publish his paraphrase of the Epistles, which he had composed while commuting to work at Moody Press in Chicago. Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 703 Ken Walker, \\"Living Bible Creator Dies But Ken Taylor's legacy is even larger\\", 7/13/2005, Christianity Today. The book appeared under the title Living Letters, and received a television endorsement from Billy Graham. This ensured the book's great success, and in 1971 Tyndale published Taylor's complete Living Bible. Taylor named the company after William Tyndale, whose English translation of the New Testament was first printed in 1526. The current president of Tyndale House is Mark D. Taylor. During the first nine years of Tyndale's history, Kenneth N. Taylor continued paraphrasing the text of the Bible. Living Letters was followed by Living Prophecies (1965) and The Living New Testament (1967). Finally, The Living Bible was launched in 1971. According to Publishers Weekly, it was the bestselling book in the United States in the years 1972-74. The Living Bible was published in many different editions and binding styles, including a popular youth edition called The Way and a study edition called The Life Application Study Bible. In 2007, Quiet Strength by Tony Dungy reached No. 1 on the New York Times hardcover, non-fiction list. It spent more than 30 weeks on either the primary or extended list, and has sold well more than one million copies. It is one of the best-selling sports-related titles in history. Subsequent books by Dungy, including Uncommon (2009), The Mentor Leader (2010), and The One Year Uncommon Life Daily Challenge (2011), have all reached the New York Times best sellers list. Tyndale's first non-fiction book to reach No. 1 on the New York Times hardcover, non-fiction list was Let's Roll, by Lisa Beamer. Beamer (born April 10, 1969 in Albany, New York) is the widow of Todd Beamer, a victim of the United Flight 93 crash as part of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. In 1996 Tyndale House released a new English translation of the Bible under the title New Living Translation (NLT). While its predecessor, The Living Bible, was a paraphrase, the NLT is a translation that was created by a team of 90 Hebrew and Greek scholars. The NLT copyright belongs to Tyndale House Foundation. A major revision of the NLT, aimed at making the translation more precise, was finished in 2004, and editions published after this date are known as the NLTse ‚Äî \\"se\\" standing for Second Edition. A third revision in 2007 made minor alterations that had been suggested by the Translation Committee.Tyndale FAQ explaining the revisions Tyndale also developed a British branch, which was named Coverdale House Publishers. Coverdale co-published a British edition of The Living New Testament with Hodder & Stoughton in 1974 and merged with another publisher, Victory Press, in 1977. The British company eventually became Kingsway Publications Ltd, which was sold to Kingsway Trust in 1979, and joined Cook Communications Ministries in 1993. Kingsway Books was one of the most prominent Christian paperback producers in the UK, until it ceased trading in 2013. SaltRiver and Tyndale Momentum are imprints of Tyndale House Publishers.

Artist Herb Roe Chunkey (also known as chunky, chenco, tchung-kee or the hoop and stick game ) is a game of Native American origin. It was played by rolling disc-shaped stones across the ground and throwing spears at them in an attempt to land the spear as close to the stopped stone as possible. It originated around 600 CE in the Cahokia region of what is now the United States (near modern St. Louis, Missouri). Chunkey was played in huge arenas as large as 47 acres (19 ha) that housed great audiences designed to bring people of the region together (i.e. Cahokians, farmers, immigrants, and even visitors). It continued to be played after the fall of the Mississippian culture around 1500 CE. Variations were played throughout North America. Early ethnographer James Adair translated the name to mean \\"running hard labor\\". Gambling was frequently connected with the game, with some players wagering everything they owned on the outcome of the game. Losers were even known to commit suicide.History of the American Indians by James Adair. Graphic representation Chunkey player design taken from an engraved shell gorget, showing motifs The falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player was an important mythological figure from the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Many different representations of the theme have been found all over the American Southeast and Midwest. Throughout the many different centuries of its portrayal, certain distinct motifs are repeated: *stance ‚Äì Many graphic representations of the chunkey player show the participant in the act of tossing the stone roller. *broken stick ‚Äì The chunkey stick is usually shown as a stripped stick, almost always broken. In the mythological cycle, this may signify that the game is over, if not defeat itself. Chunkey sticks are usually not found in archaeological excavations, although a copper sheath found next to chunkey stones at Cahokias Mound 72 may be an exception. *pillbox hat ‚Äì A cylindral shaped hat composed of unknown materials, only seen on chunkey players. *heart/bellows shaped apron ‚Äì Archaeologists theorize that this may be the graphic representation of a human scalp attached to the belt of the figure. This motif seems to echo the beaded forelock, hair style (head shaved except for top-knot) and other attachments (shell, stone and copper ornaments) usually worn by mythological figures on their heads. *Mangum Flounce ‚Äì An oddly shaped motif consisting of looping lines hanging above and below the belt of the chunkey player. Named for a Mississippian copper plate found at the Mangum Mound Site in Claiborne County, Mississippi which includes the motif. Although the figure described as the falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player is not always shown in the act of playing chunkey, the placing of many of the motifs helps identify them as the same figure. Some motifs usually associated with the figure, such as the scalp, severed heads, broken chunkey sticks, and the ethnohistoric record associating it with gambling, seem to indicate the seriousness of the game. The price of defeat in the mythological record may have been the forfeiture of one's life and head. Post-European contact \\"Tchung-kee, a Mandan Game Played with a Ring and Pole\\" by artist George Catlin Many Native Americans continued playing the chunkey game long after European contact, including the Muscogee (Creeks), Chickasaw, Chumash, Choctaw, and the Mandans, as witnessed by the artist George Catlin in 1832, In the early colonial era, it was still the most popular game among American Indians of the Southeast. Muscogee chunkey yards were a large carefully cleared and leveled area, surrounded by embankments on either side, with a pole in the center, and possibly two more at either end. The poles were used for playing another indigenous game, the ball game. The stones, valuable objects in themselves, were owned by the town or clans, not by individuals, and would be carefully preserved. * Cherokees scored their game in terms of how close the stone was to certain marks on the chunkey stick. * Chickasaws scored their game with a point for the person nearest the disc, two if it was touching the disc. * Choctaws played their game on a yard wide by in length. Poles were made of hickory wood, with four notches on the front end, one in the middle, and two at the other end. The score depended on which set of notches was closest to the disc. The game ended when a player had reached twelve points.

While nicknames differ from institution to institution, the most common nicknames for the fraternity are TDX, Thete, Theta Delt, Thumpers, TDC, Thumpty Dumpty Koo,and less commonly referred to as, Teeds. Theta Delta Chi brothers refer to their local organization as charges rather than using the common fraternity nomenclature of chapters. History =Origins and growth= Theta Delta Chi, the eleventh oldest of the college fraternities, was founded in 1847 at Union College in Schenectady, NY by six members of the class of 1849: William G. Akin, Abel Beach, Theodore Brown, Andrew H. Green, William Hyslop, and Samuel F. Wile. In the first Minute book of the Alpha charge, taken in 1848, the names Jesse D. Fonda and Theodore J. Fonda were listed alongside the other six founders. The Fonda brothers seemed to be under the impression that they were founders and the existence of this record led to the mistaken belief that Theta Delta Chi was founded in 1848. On July 14, 1914, Andrew Green wrote a letter clarifying that the fraternity was founded in 1847, and that the Fonda brothers, upon the realization that they were not founding members, lost interest and disassociated from the society. Despite this, many early fraternity records incorrectly show 1848 as the founding year. In 1849, Green and Akin along with Francis Martindale (the first initiate), organized the Beta Charge (later renamed Beta Proteron) at Ballston Law School. However, two years later the school itself moved and the new Charge was disbanded and the members put on Alpha's rolls. During the 1850s Theta Delta Chi spread rapidly, adding Charges at Vermont (1852), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1853), William and Mary (1853), Virginia (1857), Hobart (1857), Wesleyan (1857), Harvard (1856), Brown (1853), Bowdoin (1854), Kenyon (1854), Tufts (1856), Washington and Jefferson (1858), South Carolina (1859), and North Carolina (1856). Few of these remained active for long, although several were later revived. Kappa at Tufts, founded in 1856, presently enjoys the honor of being the oldest active Charge in continuous existence. During the 1860s new Charges, at, among other institutions, Lafayette and Rochester (1867), Hamilton (1868), and Dartmouth (1869), continued to be chartered at a pace that kept slightly ahead of attrition caused by Charges going inactive. The Civil War, however, severely weakened most Charges as men left for military service; many of the earliest Charges went inactive during this period, and expansion in the South ceased for half a century. Only after 1870 did Theta Delta Chi begin to acquire its present configuration. Westward expansion had traditionally been opposed by a large segment of the Fraternity, which worried that supervision and solidarity would suffer if Theta Delta Chi were to stray far from the East. The rise of the large state universities in the West, particularly in the Big Ten, eventually overcame that resistance and Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin welcomed Theta Delta Chi between 1889 and 1895. Further Midwest expansion included Illinois (1908) and Iowa State (1919). Berkeley (1900), Stanford (1903), the University of Washington (1913) and UCLA (1929) brought Theta Delta Chi in strength to the Pacific coast. Expansion in the East during the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s brought Charges to Cornell, Boston University, Wabash, CCNY, Columbia, Lehigh, Amherst, Yale, MIT, Williams, and George Washington. Pennsylvania (1915) was the last Eastern Charge to become active before World War I, although 1904 and 1910 saw the reactivation of the Southern Charges, Epsilon and Nu. Theta Delta Chi became an International Fraternity with charterings at McGill (1901) and Toronto (1912). The Great Depression and the Second World War saw a number of Charges go inactive and brought a halt to expansion. At its Centennial Convention in 1947, Theta Delta Chi stood at 28 Charges, a number that would begin to increase only in the 1950s. =Institutional development= The institutions of the Fraternity slowly took shape during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1867 anti- fraternity sentiment at Union led to the disbanding of the Alpha. As the Mother Charge, Alpha had exercised governing power over the Fraternity, but her demise, although temporary, brought about the creation of the Grand Lodge by action of the eight surviving Charges at the Convention of 1868. The Grand Lodge, originally three and now five officers (of whom two are undergraduates) remains the elected governing body of the Fraternity to this day (Alpha was rechartered in 1923, although executive power has remained with the Grand Lodge). The annual Convention has evolved into a major international assembling of Theta Delts at which all Charges are represented by undergraduate and graduate delegates and at which the major business of the Fraternity is transacted. The 1881 Convention required that the President of the Grand Lodge visit every Charge once a year; Central Fraternity Office staff now performs these duties. In 1869, the first issue of The Shield was produced, qualifying it as the oldest fraternity magazine. Although it lapsed after one issue, The Shield was revived in 1884 and has been published continually since then. The Central Fraternity Office, or CFO, evolved over many decades from a virtually one-man job, filled by a Grand Lodge member, and housed in the now defunct Theta Delta Chi Club in New York City, to a professional staff consisting of an Executive Director, a Director of Development, a Director of Charge Operations, a Director of Expansion, a Director of Charge Development, a Systems Administrator and one or more undergraduate interns, referred to as Member Service Coordinators. The office currently operates from 214 Lewis Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts. The financial health of Theta Delta Chi was ensured through the establishment of two entities, the Founders' Corporation in 1910 and the Educational Foundation in 1944. Any Theta Delt may join the Corporation on payment of $250 and thereby vote at its annual meetings. It also receives bequests and holds and invests all funds for the benefit of the Fraternity. The Educational Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) public charity, receives bequests and owns the property occupied by the CFO and other assets. It funds the educational activities of the Fraternity. =Modern expansion= Between 1951 and 1970 the Fraternity added Charges at Northwestern, Penn State, Arizona State, Rhode Island, Michigan State, Santa Barbara, Calgary, Virginia Tech, and Virginia Commonwealth; Bucknell was rechartered also. Several of these charterings brought into being some of the strongest Charges in the Fraternity, but in the increasingly uncertain climate of those times, with anti-fraternity sentiment gaining strength on a number of campuses, a significant number went inactive. The 1992 rechartering at Wabash continued a pattern of reviving inactive Charges; new charterings in the 1990s and 2000 include Northeastern, Nova Southeastern, UNC Greensboro, SUNY Albany and Merrimack. The Fort Lauderdale, FL and Greensboro, NC Charges marked a significant re-entry into the South. With the start of the new millennium, Theta Delta Chi has worked to revive several of its defunct Charges, while installing Charges on new campuses. The Chi Charge, founded in 1867, and active for most of the time since then was re-chartered in the summer of 2002 at the 155th Annual Convention. Following a brief closure, the Epsilon Charge returned to the active ranks in August 2004. Theta Delta Chi has also worked to increase its presence in the northeast with the installation of the Iota Triton Charge at UMass Dartmouth in 2005. Yet the active Charge roll call remains in flux, as the fraternity has lost several Charges, young and old, since 2001; losing Omicron Triton at URI (2001), Nu Deuteron at Lehigh (2004), Delta Triton at Northeastern (2005), Eta Triton at Nova Southeastern (2005), Mu Deuteron at Amherst (2006), and Rho Triton at VCU (2009). While these losses are disheartening, the Grand Lodge and Central Fraternity Office have worked progressively for the betterment of the fraternity, and Theta Delta Chi enters the future with the most stable foundation it has had in nearly a decade. The last two years have been marked by a significant period of growth for Theta Delta Chi. Following the chartering of the Theta Triton Charge at Binghamton University in 2007, the fraternity chartered four Charges in 2008; reviving the Epsilon Triton Charge at Arizona State University and the Rho Proteron Charge at the University of South Carolina, while chartering the Tau Triton Charge at Marist College and the Lambda Triton Charge at Rutgers University who were also winners of the Victory Cup naming them the best overall charge. In March 2009, the Gamma Deuteron Charge at the University of Michigan returned to the active roles of the fraternity. In February 2010 Psi Deuteron at UCLA was rechartered, as well as at Hobart College [Xi] (xicharge.com). In 2011, the Upsilon Triton charge at Indiana University was established. In 2016, the Psi Tetraton charge was established at the University of Arizona. In 2018 the Rho Triton at Virginia Commonwealth University was rechartered, putting the present roll standing at 29 Charges. Finally, in April 2007, the Grand Lodge hosted the inaugural Preamble Institute for its undergraduate leaders, ever hoping to improve the intellectual, moral and social being of its brotherhood. With other programming initiatives on the horizon, the fraternity seems poised for success in the coming years.

Established in 1994, it commemorates the signing of the 1966 UNESCO/ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers,http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001604/160495e.pdf which is a standard-setting instrument that addresses the status and situations of teachers around the world. This recommendation outlines standards relating to education personnel policy, recruitment, and initial training as well as the continuing education of teachers, their employment, and working conditions. World Teachers' Day aims to focus on \\"appreciating, assessing and improving the educators of the world\\" and to provide an opportunity to consider issues related to teachers and teaching.  Celebration  To celebrate World Teachers' Day, the UNESCO and Education International (EI) mounts a campaign each year to help give the world better understanding of teachers and the role they play in the development of students and society. They partner with the private sector such as media organizations to achieve this purpose. The campaign focus on different themes for every year. For instance, \\"Empowering Teachers‚Äù is the theme for 2017. This was the year World Teachers' Day commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 1997 UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel,http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001604/160495e.pdf bringing the sometimes-neglected area of teaching personnel at Higher Education institutions into the conversation about the status of teachers. For 2018, the UNESCO adopted the theme: \\"The right to education means the right to a qualified teacher.‚Äù It commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and serves as a reminder that the right to education cannot be realized without trained and qualified teachers. The UNESCO cites that everyone can help by celebrating the profession, by generating awareness about teacher issues and by ensuring that teacher respect is part of the natural order of things. Schools and students, for instance, prepare an occasion for teachers during this day. More than 100 countries commemorate World Teachers' Day and each holds its own celebrations such as the case of India, which has been commemorating Teachers' Day every 5th September. As the day usually falls during Australian school holidays, Australian states and territories celebrate on the last Friday of October each year instead.

Harry E. Hubbard was launched on 24 March 1944 by the Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, New York; sponsored by Miss Jean Hubbard, daughter; and commissioned on 22 July 1944, Commander Leonard W. Bailey in command. Service history =World War II= As flagship of Destroyer Squadron 64, Harry E. Hubbard trained precommissioning crews destined for newly constructed warships until sailing for Hawaii on 16 January 1945. She served as a training ship out of Pearl Harbor until 17 April, then departed for combat She arrived off Okinawa on 8 May 1945 to serve as a picket destroyer, guarding against the day and night waves of Japanese aerial raids and runs of kamikazes. Although the American fleet suffered losses and damage, it had come to stay. As with all previous Japanese weapons, even the kamikazes were defeated in their attempt to save this last \\"stepping stone\\" to Japan itself. For nearly two months, Harry E. Hubbard fought off the savage raiders, shooting down four kamikazes that tried to crash into her at various times. When and were badly damaged in their stand against some 50 kamikazes on 11 May 1945, Harry E. Hubbard, first to arrive on the scene, went alongside Evans to render fire- fighting, damage control and medical aid. She gave similar assistance to on 24‚Äì25 May, shooting down two kamikazes as she escorted Barry from picket station into Kerama Retto. One enemy plane was disintegrated by Harry E. Hubbards gunners a bare from the ship. Harry E. Hubbard remained off Okinawa until 24 July 1945, then escorted occupation troops to Jinsen, Korea, and carried the Commander of Destroyer Squadron 64 (DesRon 64) to Chinkai, Korea, to oversee the demilitarization of the former Japanese naval base there. She returned to Jin-sen 7 November 1945, then based out of Tsingtao, China. She performed escort, mail, and communication service for the North China Occupation force until departing 16 March 1946, for the California seaboard. She arrived at San Francisco on 28 March 1946, underwent demobilization overhaul at Oakland, then decommissioned at San Diego on 15 January 1947. She remained in the Pacific Reserve Fleet until recommissioned 14 May 1949 but decommissioned 12 December without having gone to sea. =Korean War= Following the invasion of South Korea, Harry E. Hubbard recommissioned on 27 October 1950, Commander Burres D. Wood in command. After initial shakedown along the coast of California, she departed San Diego on 2 January 1951 for two months of training in Hawaiian waters. She then steamed to assist the United Nations Forces in Korea. Besides helping guard the fast carrier task force making repeated airstrikes against the enemy, she frequently joined in gunstrike missions to bombard coastal rail and communication centers and performed as seagoing artillery to support the advance of land troops. Her bombardment missions were conducted against targets at Yongdae Gap, Wonsan, Songjin, Chingjin, Kyoto, Ohako, Bokuko, Chuminjin, and other enemy strongholds of supply and reinforcement. When was heavily damaged by an underwater explosion off Wonson 11 June 1951, Harry E. Hubbard, with the same skill as off Okinawa in 1945, moved in to render effective medical and damage control assistance. She returned to the California coast in October 1951 for overhaul and completed a similar tour of duty with the 7th Fleet off Korea July to December 1952. She returned to San Diego in January 1953 but again departed on 11 July to guard fast carrier task groups patrolling after the Armistice Agreement was signed in Korea. Intervened by patrol in the Taiwan Straits, this duty continued until 13 January 1954. She returned to San Diego for overhaul and refresher training along the western seaboard. Harry E. Hubbard departed San Diego 11 August 1954 on the first of nine additional Far East tours with the 7th Fleet which were completed by the close of 1966. During this service, she joined the roving 7th Fleet 6 to 13 February 1955 in moving in under Chinese Communist artillery defenses to cover the evacuation of Chinese Nationalist from untenable positions on the Tachen Islands. In May 1955, she participated in \\"Operation WIGWAM\\", an underwater nuclear test approximately 500 miles southwest of San Diego, California. In October to November 1956 she diverted from Australia to the \\"Dewline\\" in the Northern Pacific to serve on picket patrol during the Suez Crisis. She next joined in combined warfare exercises with SEATO Treaty nations to improve readiness in defending freedom in that part of the world. From time to time, she patrolled the Taiwan Straits to insure Taiwan was not threatened from the Communist mainland of China. She was off Guam in June 1960, twice guarding the flight of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's aircraft during his Far East visit. =Vietnam War= During the Gulf of Tonkin Incident of August 1964, Harry E. Hubbard was nearby in the South China Sea screening . The carrier task group struck to destroy North Vietnamese torpedo boats and their supporting facilities. In awarding the Navy Unit Commendation to Ticonderoga and her screen, Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze stated that they had \\"demonstrated the firm intent of the United States to maintain freedom of the seas and to take all necessary measures in defense of peace in Southeast Asia.\\" Harry E. Hubbard returned to Long Beach on 28 October 1964 for a year of warfare readiness operations along the western seaboard. In October 1965, she departed for the coast of South Vietnam. In company with in November and December 1965, she provided gunfire support for two Marine amphibious landings. In the following months, she acted as escort to and during their strike operations in the South China Sea, acting as Harbor Defense ship at Da Nang and fired more than 1,000 rounds of exploding 5-inch shells into Viet Cong strongholds along the South Vietnamese coast. She returned to Long Beach, California, on 7 April 1966. The destroyer had drawn nationwide attention on 10 March 1966 when the ABC Television Network included scenes of one of her shore bombardments along the South Vietnamese coast. Harry E. Hubbard served two more tours in Vietnam from April to August 1967 and from August 1968 to January 1969. Fate Harry E. Hubbard was decommissioned and struck on 17 October 1969.

Tradition holds that this is the valley [val-] where Charlemagne's rear-guard, under the command of Roland, was slaughtered by Vascons at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778. Tradition holds that Charlemagne's troops were returning across the Pyrenees and had become stretched thin. The Vascons, unhappy with the Franks, fell upon the rear-guard and annihilated it. Roland sounded his horn but it was in vain as his horn was split upon a rock near Roncesvalles and he was slain along with his force. This battle at Valcarlos would prove to be Charlemagne's worst, and some say only, defeat in Iberia. Today's Luzaide is a conglomeration of historical family villas and farms. The family homes are traditional with many whitewashed exteriors and family crests or coats of arms on the exterior. Many of the local landowners, such as the owners of Curutzezahar, a family home one kilometre up the hillside from the village center, have turned their homes into bed-and-breakfast style lodgings for the growing rural tourism industry in the Basque Country. Historically, families would be less associated with the town in which they lived and more with the home in which they were raised. Thus, using the prior home name, Curutzezaharreko would denote one who is from the house of Curutzezahar. The local cemetery shows that regional nomenclature on many headstones. The town lies on the Camino de Santiago or Camino Franc√©s pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. There are two routes through the region, one of which passes through the town. There is a modern monument to the pilgrimage road near the city hall representing a recumbent pilgrim. According to the locals, who make no apologies to Roncesvalles, which is located a few kilometres further along the road, Luzaide/Valcarlos is the true jumping off point for pilgrims in Spain who are travelling to Santiago.

Killaloe is a town located in Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada in the township of Killaloe, Hagarty and Richards. Geographically it is located in Eastern Ontario. The shores of Golden Lake are located to the east, which is well known for quality angling and year-round recreation. The present day town is located about north of the former townsite of \\"Old Killaloe\\". In 2001, the town had a population of 660 (all data after that is available only for the overall township). History The name Killaloe (pronounced \\"KILL-a-LOO\\") hails from a community of the same name in Ireland and salutes the Irish heritage of many of the first settlers to this area, who came to Canada in the early 19th century seeking a better life. The early beginnings of this little town centered on the lumber trade. Built in 1849, and rebuilt in 1870 after a devastating fire, the mill at Old Killaloe harnessed waterpower to grind grain for area residents up to 1930, and planed lumber until the 1960s. In those days it was known as Fort McDonnell, but it became known as Killaloe Station circa 1868 when the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway was expanding at a furious pace through the rugged countryside of the Madawaska Valley in response to the demands of the lumber industry. In 1854 the construction of the Opeongo Line brought settlers and the logging industry to this area which originally had been occupied by the Algonquins. The Algonquin in the area still continue an ongoing land claim which covers the entire region. A majority of the settlers were French Canadians and Irish Catholic immigrants but among them were Poles, Kashubians and Germans as well. With the railroad construction essentially finished, and the forestry industry declining many of the people took to farming. Unfortunately the soil was poor. Rocky land and short growing seasons meant that many farms failed. The population went into a steady decline which has only leveled off in the past few decades. Today the lumber industry is still important to the livelihood of many in the surrounding communities. Both large and small logging operations and sawmills still support the local economy even though the railway no longer runs through the village. The last passenger train rolled through in 1962, and in 1968 the train station was torn down. Killaloe still maintains a flavour of the turn of the century in many of the commercial buildings which are more than 100 years old. For years, Killaloe was known across Canada for its radio and weather station, which operated here from 1938 to 1972Killaloe Area History as part of a country-wide chain of sites designed for aircraft communication. The site was a frost pocket with nightly minimum temperatures among the coldest in eastern Canada. A small airstrip operated at the weather station until 1953 before services were moved to neighbouring Bonnechere. In May 2014,Pembroke Observer Article the founders of BeaverTails Grant and Pam Hooker officially titled Killaloe as the birthplace of the BeaverTails. Economy Today, tourism and recreation, power generation, arts and crafts are the regions main sources of employment and revenue. The summer population here is boosted by plenty of freshwater and excellent fishing, most seasonal properties with cottages belong to residents of the Ottawa area. Snowmobiling, snowshoeing, ice fishing and skiing (both crosscountry and downhill) are the prime winter activities. Logging and sawmill operations still exists here, but not to the extent they once did as much of the areas old growth forests have been felled.

The dolls started at 19-20\\" tall,http://dollreference.com/uneeda_dollikin.html although later versions were 12\\" and 6\\". The dolls were manufactured from about 1957 to 1962 to compete with similar 18‚Äì21 inch sized dolls, that were popular through the 1950s and 1960s, such as Madame Alexander's \\"Cissy\\", Ideal's \\"Revlon\\", American Character's \\"Toni\\", Deluxe Reading's \\"Candy\\" Horseman's \\"Sindy\\". Horseman's \\"Wonderkin\\" and Valentine's \\"Mannikin\\" Reference link: There is a Facebook group dedicated to Dollikin and the people who collect and admire her. It can be found by searching, The Dollikin Collective Name The Dollikins name was probably inspired by the Miss Dollikins series of books by Anne Jane Cupples chronicling a doll's adventures, that were published in 1870 by Thomas Nelson & Sons. The books featured woodcut plate illustrations by R. Patterson and others, and the series was known as The Dollikins Library and also as The Story of Miss Dollikins. The first four volumes were titled as follows: #Her Outset in the World, Her Illness, and Recovery #Her Visit to the Seaside and What Came of It #Returns from the Seaside to Her Old Life in the Nursery #Showing How She Learned to Become a Young Lady History Uneeda's original Dollikins doll was 20\\" tall and had sixteen points of articulation. The doll was advertised as the \\"Fabulous, Educational Dollikin - The Original Doll Mannikin - A Miracle of Flexibility. Sixteen flexible joints, virtually duplicating all positions of the human body!\\" and was jointed at the wrists, elbows, biceps, shoulders, waist, hips, knees, and ankles. The bodies were made of hard plastic and the heads were made of vinyl with rooted hair in a variety of colors and styles, and had 'sleep eyes' that opened and closed. There is no information available to indicate what year each of the different versions of the 20\\" Dollikin were being marketed. Uneeda used the same head mold, marked \\"Uneeda 2s\\", on their non-articulated, 18\\" fashion dolls as well. A number of hair colors and styles and face paint that were not available on the 20\\" Dollikin body can be found on the fashion dolls bearing the same head molds. It is not known what years or for how long these straight-legged, hard plastic fashion dolls were produced. Dollikins were also produced in hard vinyl in a smaller, 15\\" size. This version of the Dollikins is rare and advertisements of the time indicate that they were only produced for one year, most likely 1957. The 20\\" and 15\\" Dollikins were manufactured in Uneeda's factory in Brooklyn, New York. The original outfits on all these dolls were sophisticated and the packaging was attractive. Original Uneeda Dollikin clothing can be identified by the large, donut-shaped snaps which are marked with the letters \\"SK LIKITS RAU\\". Unlike manufacturers of many of the popular, similar-sized fashion dolls of that era, Uneeda did not produce additional outfits to be purchased separately for the dolls. From 1969 through the early 1980s, Uneeda produced several versions of the Dollikins as an 11 inch, multi- jointed, fashion doll. The dolls came dressed in brightly colored, one-piece bodysuits with multi-colored flowered sashes and plastic boots. In the UK, the eleven-inch dolls were issued as \\"Action Girl\\", \\"Action Dollikins\\" or \\"Action Donna\\", which were very similar to the US-issued dolls except that on some versions of the doll, the eyes were side-glancing and their hair was styled differently. The US dolls had long, straight hair with piece of hair on either side of the face pulled up into a bow on top of the head. The Action Girl dolls had straight hair with no bows, or a curly, side-ponytail. Uneeda marketed a line of clothing to be purchased separately for both the 11-inch Dollikins, available in the US, and for the \\"Action Dolls\\" distributed in the UK. In the late 1950s, Uneeda also sold a \\"Baby Dollikins\\", a 21\\" tall baby doll with eleven points of articulation. It was an infant doll with the same intricate construction as the fashion dolls. Uneeda used the same head mold for this doll as was used on their \\"Dewdrop\\" or \\"Sweetums\\" doll, and that was also later used on a number of other generic baby dolls of that time period. The doll came with either rooted hair in brown, blonde or red, or molded hair, and was dressed in a one or two-piece pajama set. Uneeda Doll Company also came out with a 6¬Ω\\" version of the Dollikin fashion doll, similar to Topper's \\"Dawn\\" doll called \\"Donna\\" or \\"Triki Miki\\". These dolls had curly hair pulled to one side. Information is scarce on these dolls as the Uneeda Doll Company changed hands and moved its production overseas.

View from the Kings Canyon Gorge at sunset. View of the sandstone domes at Kings Canyon. Kings Canyon is a canyon in the Northern Territory of Australia located at the western end of the George Gill Range about southwest of Alice Springs and about south of Darwin within the Watarrka National Park.  Description  A view from the upper edge of the canyon The walls of Kings Canyon are over 100 metres high, with Kings Creek at the bottom. Part of the gorge is a sacred Aboriginal site and visitors are discouraged from leaving the walking tracks. Three walks exist at Kings Canyon. The two km (return) and approximately one-hour Kings Creek Walk traces the bottom of the gorge. At the end of the walk is a platform, with views of the canyon walls above. The six km (loop) Kings Canyon Rim Walk traces the top of the canyon and takes three to four hours to complete. A steep climb at the beginning of the walk, which locals call \\"Heartbreak Hill\\" (or \\"Heart Attack Hill\\", due to its steepness), takes visitors up to the top, with views of the gorge below and of the surrounding landscape. About half way during the walk, a detour descends to the Garden of Eden, a permanent waterhole surrounded by plant life. The last half of the walk passes through a maze of weathered sandstone domes, reminiscent of the Bungle Bungle. A slow descent brings the visitor back to the starting point. The loop can also be done in reverse (anti-clockwise), but the National Park Rangers encourage visitors to walk in one direction. Access to the walk may be restricted during hot weather. The 22 km Giles Track connects Kings Canyon to Kathleen Springs and is popular with more adventurous hikers. Birds that can be seen on the Kings Canyon Rim walk include spinifex pigeon, zebra finch, grey-headed honeyeater, dusky grasswren, black-breasted buzzard and peregrine falcon. Kings Canyon Solar Power Station was a photovoltaic power station in the Northern Territory, with a generating capacity of 225 kWp and electricity production of 372,000 kWh of electricity per annum. It was the largest single installation of its kind in Australia and began operation in December 2003.Renewable energy It has been shut down since December 2015 due to the local tourist resort installing its own generators.  Geology  According to geologists, the valley was formed more than 400 million years ago. It cuts through a layer of Mereenie Sandstone, which was deposited here 400 million years ago. The sandstone can be viewed in the form of 30-m high cliffs, and as you go deeper, you can witness the softer Carmichael Sandstone, which has been present here for 440 million years. These two layers of sandstone are divided by a thin layer of purple shale or mudstone which depicts the environmental changes between the two formations.

He was born in Elberfeld, now a part of Wuppertal in North Rhine-Westphalia. Abendroth was an important contributor to the constitutional foundation of postwar West Germany. He briefly held a professorship in law in East Germany. As he was opposed to Stalinism, he left for West Germany, where he was appointed professor in political science at Marburg in 1950. Abendroth also served as a senior judge in the state court of Hesse. In the late 1950s, at the University of Marburg, Abendroth oversaw the habilitation in political science of major German philosopher, sociologist, and political theorist J√ºrgen Habermas. Habermas dedicated his habilitation work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society, to Abendroth, in particular because Habermas valued Abendroth's role in re-founding postwar West Germany as a liberal constitutional state and in engaging in vigorous public debate in the spirit of the ideal Habermas laid out in his first major study.Peter Uwe Hohendahl, \\"J√ºrgen Habermas: 'The Public Sphere' (1964),\\" trans. Patricia Russian, New German Critique 3 (Autumn 1974), p. 45-8.  Personal history from birth to end of World War II  According to the biography provided by the German Resistance Memorial Center: \\"Abendroth was born in Elberfeld in 1906 and grew up in a family of Social Democrats. His father was a teacher. He joined the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) at the age of 14. As a result of his agitation for a united front of Social Democrats and Communists, he was expelled from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1928. In 1933, he lost his job as a junior lawyer for political reasons, and went on to provide legal advice for many opponents of the regime. Following his first arrest, Abendroth emigrated to Switzerland, where he gained his PhD. After acting as a courier for some time, he decided to return to Berlin in 1935. There, he was an active member of the resistance until he was imprisoned for several years in 1937. Forcibly drafted into one of the 999th Division‚Äôs ‚Äúprobation units‚Äù in February 1943, he soon deserted to the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). He was taken prisoner by the British, and carried out political education for opponents of the regime in prisoner of war camps in Egypt\\". In one of his books Abendroth, W., Dietrich, B., & Perels, J. (1976). Ein Leben in der Arbeiterbewegung: Gespr√§che. Suhrkamp Abendroth recalled his experience in German-occupied Greece. He was originally stationed in the Greek island of Lemnos where he helped setting up an anti-fascist cell among the soldiers of the German occupation forces in the island. According to Abendroth this anti-fascist cell prevented the destruction of Lemnos's electricity generation unit that was planned by the German forces as part of their retreat in 1944. During the evacuation of the island by the Germans, Abendroth and five other German soldiers, defected to the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) that was active in the island. Subsequently the group were sent to Greek island of Lesvos, where they were used in propaganda aimed at the German occupation forces in that island. According to a brief biography included in his book 'A Short History of the European Working Class'Abendroth, W. (1972), A short history of the European working class, London: NLB Abendroth was imprisoned by the British in 1944 and \\"after being held, with other German anti-fascists, in British internment camps, he returned to Germany in 1946 where he taught at the universities of Leipzig and Jena\\".  Personal history after World War II  In 2017 approximately 100,000 pages of documents were leaked to the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) with information related to the activities of Reinhard Gehlen (1902-1979). Gehlen, who was a prominent Nazi before World War II, became the Head of the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) after the War and the CIA-affiliated, anti-communist, Gehlen Organisation (1946‚Äì56). According to the leaked documents Reinhard Gehlen, personally authorized the conduct of physical surveillance of Prof. Wolfgang Abendroth. According to a report on Gehlen's activities Weber W. (2017) : \\"[t]he archive material includes a carefully composed dossier on the lawyer and political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth, who was banned from working as a legal trainee in 1933 due to his socialist leanings. A few years later, Abendroth was sent into a punishment battalion of the Wehrmacht active in the war in Greece. He deserted from the Army and joined the Greek resistance movement.

Features The tomb is oriented east to west, with the main entrance located on the eastern end. It is a large tomb, with parallel twin galleries to either side of the entrance. There are two western galleries each divided into two chambers by jamb stones. One of the two western galleries is topped with a large capstone. The court space measures approximately 45 ft. This configuration, with two galleries located side by side across from the entrance and looking into a central full court, is considered unusual. A large stone lies in the centre of the court, partially blocking the view of the gallery entrances. The court is marked partly by orthostats and partly by dry- walling, indicating an intermediary state between an open forecourt and a full-court. In front of the left-hand gallery is a gabled lintel-stone. To the left of the entrance, built into the fabric of the (restored) cairn is a subsidiary chamber, with its roofstone propped up against its front. To the right of the entrance is a second chamber with its roofstone almost in place. Next to each of these chambers is a stone with engravings in passage-tomb style ‚Äì a unique occurrence at a court-tomb.

Unproduced Concepts  Concept drawings of additional action figures, playsets and accessories exist. =The Guardians of the Gemstones= A very small quantity of the Dymondia figure was released in Europe. The figure appears to be a repaint of the Rubee figure rather than including any unique molding, which seems to indicate the Dymondia figures may have been prototypes that Galoob was using to sell Series 2 to retailers. The Dymondia figure was in a new blue Series 2 box as opposed to the pink Series 1 box design. None of the other Series 2 Guardians of the Gemstones characters are known to have been produced. *Dymondia - Dymondia's bodice, gauntlets, skirt and boots were white with dark pink accents in a fanned shape. Instead of a cape, she had light pink wings, similar to those of a bird (as opposed to Moth Lady's insect-like wings). Dymondia's hair was white, and looks like it was designed to sparkle. She wore a golden headband with a diamond at the center near her forehead. Dymondia's diamond-shaped shield was white, dark pink and gold and contained a diamond gemstone. Her weapon was a white and gold staff, topped by a diamond. *Coral - Coral's bodice and boots were white, with golden shells embellished on them.

The Route from Usk to Newport is former Milwaukee Road trackage and Newport-Dover is former Great Northern RY trackage. The line used to go to Metaline Falls but was abandoned north of Usk in 2016 History The line was built by the Idaho and Washington Northern Railroad between 1907 and 1911. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (MILW) acquired the line in 1916. The MILW entered financial difficulty in the 1970s and the Newport - Metaline Falls section was sold to Port of Pend Oreille following the company's downsizing. The Port of Pend Oreille established the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad and contracted railroad holding company Kyle Railways to manage the POVA. Freight service began on October 1, 1979, and the Port of Pend Oreille took over the POVA's management from Kyle Railways in 1984. The Newport - Dover section was acquired from BNSF on March 3, 1998. Heritage railroad Beginning in 1981, the North Pend Oreille Valley Lions Club worked with the POVA to operate a seasonal excursion train service on several weekends in the summer and fall. The round trip runs from Ione to Metaline Falls along the spectacular Box Canyon, passing through several tunnels and crossing several bridges and wooden trestles. The passenger cars consisted of 3 standard coaches as well as 3 open-air cars and a caboose with some equipment borrowed from the Inland NW Railway Historical Society. Financial issues hurt the excursion train service, as upkeep and inspections became cost prohibitive. In October 2016, the railroad operated its last excursion.

The title comes from the fifth verse of the 23rd Psalm. The novel depicts a world in which the United States remained isolationist and so did not participate in the Second World War, thus allowing a victory to the Axis powers, which divided the world among themselves. However, some years after the war, the Third World War occurred and featured the Axis powers defeating the United States and Canada. Set in 2010, the novel focuses on Heinrich Gimpel and a small group of Jews who survived the Holocaust by passing as Gentiles. The events occur against a backdrop that parallels the Soviet Union's last days, with characters based upon Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, and others. Plot summary Wehrmacht officer Heinrich Gimpel astonishes his 10-year-old daughter, Alicia, with a secret that has been hidden from her all her life: the family is Jewish. He explains that the Gimpels, their friends Walther and Esther Stutzman, and their extended families all belong to the remnants of Jews who now survive by hiding in plain sight within the very society that wants them dead. Now old enough, by family tradition, to be trusted with this life-or-death deception, Alicia is obliged to hide the truth from her friends, her classmates, and even her younger sisters, even as she is forced to regard her school's racist curriculum from a new perspective that leaves her sick and angry over all the anti-Semitic propaganda that she had always learned and parroted without question. Meanwhile, Heinrich finds himself caught in the marital strife between his co-worker, Willi Dorsch, and Willi's wife, Erika. Willi, doubting Erika's fidelity becais of her constant flirting with Heinrich, begins an extra-marital affair with his secretary. Embittered by her husband's infidelity, Erika wants a retaliatory affair with Heinrich. He resists, which leads to Erika accusing him of being a Jew and Heinrich being arrested by the Sicherheitspolizei. It is only after Erika realizes that her accusation caused Heinrich's children to be taken as well that she confesses her lie and attempts to commit suicide, unaware the entire time that Heinrich and his family actually are Jewish. Esther Stutzman, who works as a receptionist in a doctor's office, also experiences a close call with Nazi policies when her friends Richard and Maria Klein, closeted Jews like herself, bring their ailing eight-month-old baby, Paul, in for a checkup. The diagnosis, Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, is a disease known to be prevalent among Jews. A subsequent investigation into his family background would spell doom for his parents and any names that they might be forced to reveal under torture. Although Esther's husband, Walther, is able to hack into the Reich's computer network and change the Klein's family history, it is the revelation that Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Lothar Pr√ºtzmann has a nephew with Tay-Sachs that brings the investigation to a halt. In the background, the death of the current F√ºhrer, Kurt Haldweim (modelled on the real-life Austrian president Kurt Waldheim), causes him to be replaced by the reform-minded Heinz Buckliger, who relaxes the oppressive laws of the Reich. In a secret speech, with word-of-mouth spreading it to the populace, the new F√ºhrer denounces his predecessors and says that the Reich committed crimes in the past. Reactionary opposition rallies around the SS, and the populist Gauleiter of Berlin, Rolf Stolle, champions accelerates reform. Things come to a head with the announcement of relatively free elections: candidates need not be Nazi Party members though they must be Aryan. Led by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Lothar Pr√ºtzmann, the SS carries out a conservative coup d'√©tat, imprisons the F√ºhrer, and installs former High Commissioner of Ostland Affairs, Odilo Globocnik, as the new F√ºhrer. However, Stolle instigates a people power movement, which the Wehrmacht supports. The coup d'√©tat is defeated after Walther Stutzman salts the country's computer network with the information about Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Pr√ºtzmann's Tay-Sachs afflicted nephew. Soon, Berlin comes to the conclusion that Pr√ºtzmann is a Jew, which definitively turns the tide against the coup. In the aftermath, Pr√ºtzmann kills himself, Globocnik is lynched, and Buckliger is re-enstated as F√ºhrer (albeit harrowed by his detainment and eclipsed by the popular Stolle). At the end of the novel, elections deliver a pro-reform majority to the Reichstag, with Stolle as its speaker, and produces a mandate for the independence of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in a concurrent referendum. Also, the Gimpels and the Stutzmans gather to tell the ten-year-old Francesca that she is a Jew. Viewpoint characters *Heinrich Gimpel, a hidden Jew serving as an officer at the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht in Berlin. Heinrich is careful and meticulous about maintaining his masquerade and originally even from the reader, who does not before nearly a whole chapter learn that Gimpel is a hidden Jew and a leader of a secret Jewish community. Heinrich's specific job is to monitor the American payment of tribute to Germany and to detect the frequent attempts to avoid payment. Gimpel is arrested because a friend's wife denounces him as a Jew although she did not know that he really is one after he resisted her sexual advances. Gimpel is eventually released from custody, with an SS major who escorts him out the door casually remarking to him: \\"You find us in the oddest places.\\" *Lise Gimpel, Heinrich's wife, also a Jew. *Alicia Gimpel, Heinrich and Lise's ten-year-old daughter and oldest of three sisters. At the beginning of the book, she is initiated into the secret that she and other family and friends are Jewish. She is stunned but gradually comes to accept it. *Susanna Weiss, a Medieval English scholar at the Friedrich Wilhelm University. She is also one of the few surviving Jews left in the Reich. *Esther Stutzman, a receptionist at a Berlin area pediatrician's office. She and her husband, Walther, are also hidden Jews. She is a tuckerization of the well-known science-fiction/fantasy author Esther Friesner. *Walther Stutzman, a computer programmer at Zeiss. He has unauthorized access into many of the Reich's databases using codes created by his father, who was involved with transferral of paper records to computer records. He can assign false Aryan pedigrees to Jewish people to allow them to avoid detection by the Reich. Setting =World politics and geography= A map showing the world's borders as described throughout the book. Political alignment The F√ºhrer of the Greater German Reich is the world's most powerful political leader. Besides the Reich itself, the \\"Greater Germanic Empire\\" includes countries that are occupied (but not annexed) and others that are allied. The occupied countries have their own governments but limited sovereignty; the Nazis interfere in their internal affairs, especially in applying racist ideology. The allies, though technically independent, are subject to heavy Nazi influence; most of them represent the local varieties of racist, fascist, and radical nationalist forces. Italy's empire is around the Mediterranean Sea, including the parts of Africa granted by the Reich. The Nazis compel the Italians to carry out large-scale massacres of Arabs in their territories in the Middle East. The nation is controlled by the House of Savoy (headed by King Umberto) and the Duce of the Italian Empire. While much of Africa is divided up among Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, an \\"Aryan- dominated\\" Union of South Africa remains as an independent ally of the German Reich. Spain is mentioned as being governed by a caudillo, but no mention is made about the status of the Spanish monarchy. Although it is less powerful than Germany, Imperial Japan is a nuclear power that keeps the Reich at bay with the implicit threat of mutually assured destruction. Moreover, Japan has its own subordinate rulers (only the Emperor of Manchukuo is mentioned) in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Despite having \\"an ocean of slave labor\\" at its disposal, Japan now concentrates upon developing high technologies. Despite the Germano‚ÄìNipponese alliance, the Nazis consider the Japanese to be racially inferior and lacking in creativity, using propaganda pointing to a perceived decrease in Japan's technological advances as proof. Even so, Japanese tourists, students and restaurants are commonly seen within the Reich. United States and Canada In the 1960s and the 1970s, Germany and the Axis powers defeated the United States and Canada in the Third World War with the nuclear bombs that they had developed. The key American cities of Washington, DC and Philadelphia were destroyed by the bombs, with their environments being rendered uninhabitable for years to come. Other cities such as New York City, St. Louis, and Chicago were damaged by conventional bombing raids. The US capital was moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where a pro-Nazi puppet government was set up, and the Reich maintains Wehrmacht occupation forces in New York City, Chicago, St. Louis, and Omaha itself. Upon conquering the US, the Einsatzkommandos and the American white supremacists systematically kill the country's Jewish and most of its Black populations, with any remaining Black people being used for slave labor by the Reich. The US pays annual tribute, an important income for Germany's economy, despite US hyperinflation and the US dollar's disappearance as a world currency, but whenever possible, the US evades paying the tribute. Other occupied nations Henry IX is the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom (although his lineage is never explained), which has been annexed by the Reich. The British Union of Fascists is the governing party, with Charlie LyntonTony Blair's full name is Anthony Charles Lynton Blair. as Prime Minister; however, it is internally divided over the extent of the Reich's influence in its governance (reminiscent of British euoscepticism) and the selection process for a new F√ºthrer. The Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, and Serbs are killed because they are Untermenschen, and the Arabs for being as \\"Semitic as Jews.\\" Moreover, the Reich, Italian Empire, Portugal, and Spain commit the genocide of the African populations and enslave survivors. South Africa, however, still continues its apartheid and so ironically keeps the Black South Africans from being either killed off or used for slave labor. Any Jews found are immediately killed on sight, and while \\"the surviving Russians were pushed far east of the Urals,\\" there is much guerrilla fighting, which requires forts to protect the German settlers. The Nazis treat the Czechs, Croats, and Bulgarians relatively well although they are Slavs: the Czechs greatly contribute to the Reich's economy, and the Croats and Bulgarians savagely persecute the Serbs by severe racial discrimination, suppressing rebellions, and enslavement or killing of dissidents. Iranians and Indians are classified as \\"Aryan\\" are not persecuted, and some are even invited to study at German universities. =Technology= The level of technology in the novel is much the same as in the actual 21st century. The Wehrmacht uses jet aircraft, panzers, U-boats, armoured personnel carriers, assault rifles, and a variety of naval warships. The \\"Ministry of Air and Space\\" is mentioned as having planted a permanent outpost on the Moon and to be carrying out a manned landing on Mars, and it may be planning a manned mission to the Jovian moons. Orbital weather platforms are also mentioned in the novel. Civilian technology has also advanced similarly to its military counterpart in the 21st century. Jet airliners, televisions (called televisors), computers (although the Internet has not reached the same level as its real-life counterpart for fear of it being a \\"security nightmare\\"), modern cars, microwaves, and dishwashers are used throughout the Reich. The German population enjoys very high living standards at the expense of non- Germans throughout the Reich and occupied nations. =Society= The Reich's society is culturally dominant because of its victories in the Second and the Third World Wars, and German companies and organizations dominate the economies of the allied and occupied nations. Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are thriving, and Zeiss produces the Reich's computers and software. Agfa-Gevaert produces television commercials that encourage Germans to migrate to the Ostland territories, and Lufthansa covers the air. The British Broadcasting Corporation is mentioned throughout the novel, with the Reich's counterpart being the RRG. A RRG newscaster, Horst Witzleben, appears several times in the novel, and his \\"Seven O'clock News\\" is highly influential. The Reich Genealogical Office has online genealogical records, which can define life and death to persons suspected of being Jewish. (The real-life Nazis already used the punchcards developed by IBM to mark out the Jews and eventually arrest them and send them to extermination camps.Review of IBM and the Holocaust) Economy The Reichsmark is the dominant world currency and is legal tender in the Greater German Reich, but most of the Reich's member states, territories, and allies (including the Empire of Japan, Latin America, Britain, and America) have national currencies. Since the Reich dictates favorable exchange rates, the Reichsmark is readily accepted (and apparently welcome) even in places in which it is not legal tender. Britain continues to use its pre-decimal pound sterling currency, but the five-shilling Crown coin is struck in cheap aluminum, not silver, as \\"silver\\" coins were at least partly made of before World War II and briefly afterward. Education School is the way with which the German Reich indoctrinates and controls the citizenry, starting in its youth. Corporal punishment is practiced in schools against actions such as disrespecting a superior, not doing one's school work, and for not knowing the correct answers to teachers' questions in the classroom. The school year occupies most of the calendar year, with the only major holidays being the two-week holiday between Christmas and the New Year, and the week-long break after Easter. The remainder of the year is school work though one-day holidays occur infrequently. The Hitler Jugend and Bund Deutscher M√§del are compulsory for children in the German Reich, the Nazi gender roles having changed little. At the end of the novel, the Hitler Jugend implements changes towards preparing boys into becoming responsible, adult citizens, rather than army conscripts. The Reich education system is only for Germany; allied states and occupied territories control their own education systems. In the US, American children continue to have long summer holidays from school, a fact that German teachers emphasize as one of the reasons for its defeat to the German Reich. German academics have key roles in the processes of racial discrimination and genocide. The German Institute for Racial Studies, part of Friedrich Wilhelm University, is charged with defining the peoples and ethnic groups of the \\"Germanic Empire\\" that are subhuman and so are marked for genocide or slavery. At its side, as the smiling face of the Reich, is the German Institute for Foreigners (founded in 1922), charged with instructing those foreigners who fortunately were classed as \\"Aryans\\", such as Iranians and Indians, in the German language and culture. Academic life is male-dominated. Although it is possible for a woman to have an academic career, the few who do so face great difficulties and must engage in daily, petty struggles to gain privileges that are granted to men. Under Reich sexism, an assertive woman might be accused that she is \\"not a proper National Socialist woman,\\" but such attitudes are regarded as old-fashioned and challenged by younger people. Sports The Reich's sports are the sole province of the Aryans and are controlled by the German Federation of Sport, which favors German sportsmen over sportsmen from other states. It has the power to reserve the right to withdraw from competition with foreign teams and to withhold the rights of foreign teams to tour the Reich when political relations sour. An example is the boycott of Italian sports teams after a riot at a football match in Milan between the home team's fans and the visiting Leipzig team's fans. The deprivation of the right to tour the Reich and of having the Reich's teams visit is financially hurtful. Germany won a recent World Cup but now is challenged by a powerful, multi-racial Brazil, with Negroes and Native Americans, among others. Surviving Jews Although the Jews are considered to be exterminated in 2010, anti-Semitic stereotypes remain strong in popular culture and official propaganda and are an important part of school education. The books of anti-Semitic author Julius Streicher (Trust No Fox in the Green Meadow, No Jew on His Oath, and The Poison Mushroom) are universal reading for German children. The hidden Jews feel obliged to buy them for their children since doing otherwise might arouse suspicion. Jews both are and are not of the society surrounding them. They must constantly play the role of parroting the prevailing anti-Semitic clich√©s. They keep as much of their Jewish identity as can be imparted in secret meetings among themselves, with purely oral lore though some written Hebrew is taught. With the exception of the Bible, which can be kept openly, since Christianity, while not encouraged, is allowed by the Reich, they dare not possess books on Judaism though they still exist. All of the viewpoint characters were born under the Nazis, and maintaining the masquerade is second nature. The greatest danger is when a child is told of his or her true identity, usually at age of ten, which is considered old enough to keep the secret. Children often are shocked, since like all other German children, they grew up exposed to constant anti-Semitism from teachers and children's books. The adults soften the shock by teaching the children to feel privileged to belong to such a secret society. It is mentioned that the hidden Jews regard it as too dangerous to gather on the Major Holidays and fasts of Judaism, such as Passover and Yom Kippur, and so they hold their secret gatherings on Minor Holidays such as Purim. Other minorities German industry uses Slavic, Black, and Arab slave laborers for \\"dirty\\" or dangerous work. In one passage, an industrial accident in the Ruhr is reported on television as having caused the deaths of \\"Twelve Aryans and an unknown number of Untermenschen.\\" Homosexuals are actively persecuted. Unlike Jews, Gypsies, and other \\"inferior races,\\" which are thought to have been wiped out\\" homosexuals continue to arise and are hunted by the security police unless they have political connections to protect them. =Locales= Berlin Much of the story occurs in Berlin. The Reich capital is replete with the monumental architecture of Albert Speer. An important example is the Great Hall, which can house more than 100,000 people and held the funeral of deceased F√ºhrer Kurt Haldweim. With a dome 200 m high and 250 m wide, it is crowned with a massive, gilded German eagle holding a swastika. Nearby is the F√ºhrer's Palace, the F√ºhrer's official residence, which is guarded by soldiers from the Infantry Regiment Gro√üdeutschland, which is barracked near the Palace. Aside from security, it is a ceremonial, dress corps armed with (antique) Gewehr 98 rifles and an arsenal that includes assault rifles and tanks. Next is the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, a grand public square for rallies and such. The Soldier's Hall commemorates the German Reich's military might by exhibiting the radioactive remains of the Liberty Bell (displayed behind lead glass), gliders that were used to invade Britain, the first Panzer IV to enter the Kremlin, and the railroad carriage in which Imperial Germany surrendered to the Allies in 1918, at Compi√®gne, France, and in which France surrendered to Nazi Germany in 1940. The Arch of Triumph is 170 m wide and 1700 m deep although it is modelled on the smaller Arc de Triomphe in Paris; much of the Berlin district's automobile traffic transits through it. Because the city is populous, public transport (rapid transit trains, U-Bahn, and commuter railroads) is well developed; one rail station is the \\"South Station,\\" near government offices. Speer's plans cause the anchoring of the south end of the main boulevard with the most monumental structures. Captured enemy weapons and battle wreckage (a British fighter plane, a Soviet tank, a US submarine conning tower) are displayed outside the station. Berlin also has the headquarters to the key government ministries: Air and Space, Justice, Interior, Transport, Food, Economics, Colonial, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, and the F√ºhrer's Office. The Kurf√ºrstendamm is a commercial district that glitters with neon signs and reflected sun light, but the citizens of Berlin use the street's full name in their daily lives, instead of the abbreviated slang of the native. Berlin is culturally vibrant by offering residents and visitors a wildly successful musical on Churchill and Stalin and cosmopolitan cuisines, but under the Reinheitsgebot, the nation's medieval beer-purity law bans the importation of Japanese beer. American fast food is a rarity because of the American economic collapse after it was defeated in World War III defeat, despite the existence of eateries such as The Greasy Spoon. Culturally, the toy store Ulbright offers pretty \\"Vicki\\" dolls and the \\"Landser Sepp\\" action figures (a boy's doll) to the Reich's children. Vicki dolls are made in the US with slave labour and come in different varieties, but all dolls look perfectly Aryan and so abide to Reich policy. London Parts of the story also take place in London, the capital of Britain. In the novel, the British people are impoverished because of the German occupation. William Shakespeare and his works are more widely known and published in Germany than in his homeland, partly because of Britain's economic collapse. During the war, much of London was destroyed by dive bombers and panzers as well as the last-ditch resistance by Churchill and his supporters. Key British buildings, including the Parliament building, Big Ben and St Paul's Cathedral, have been completely destroyed, with photographs and paintings being their only remaining legacy. Some areas of the city have been in ruins for over 70 years because of both the harsh reparations imposed on the British by the Germans and the partisan uprisings that were completely crushed only by the mid-1970s. German city planners often visit Britain to see how it deals with building from the clean slate that they can never have. The Crown is a hotel that serves as the meeting place of the British Union of Fascists; as its name implies, it is dominated by an enormous crown. The BUF's members have a reputation of being violent thugs, and a fight involving its members takes place outside and within the hotel. A second hotel, the Silver Eagle, hosts the Medieval English Association conference and bears a glass and steel eagle on its top. Both hotels are modern, glass-fronted structures. Literary criticism and significance Gavriel David Rosenfeld, in his work The World Hitler Never Made, notes that unlike other alternate histories that deal with a Nazi victory, In the Presence of Mine Enemies humanizes the Nazis. Rosenfeld stated that would have been impossible in earlier years, when the trend was to show the Nazis in alternate histories as the \\"incarnation of evil.\\" Rosenfeld, however, noted that despite Turtledove's reputation as an acclaimed and skilled writer in alternate history, Turtledove received a lot of criticism for the novel, which made Rosenfeld assume that most American audiences do not wish to humanize the Nazis.Id. 158. Adam-Troy Castro, however, gave a good review of the novel. Though he found that the hidden Jewish characters of the novel weathered their secret life too well and compared others who live secret lives in our society (for examples homosexuals) who sometimes have to deal with incidents of self-loathing, alcoholism, drug abuse and even suicide. In the end Castro was thrilled to see at the end of the novel the main characters standing tall against an oppressive government.

He can be seen at almost all sporting events, wearing the uniform of the team that is playing. In the past, Cosmo's job was a volunteer position, and no scholarship or academic assistance was given. However, scholarships and other benefits are offered today. The mascot is expected to be involved in civic events and university functions. Cosmo was named the Mascot \\"National Champion\\" in the SXM College's Twitter poll in April 2020.https://twitter.com/SXMCollege/status/1251224086514147328 History of Cosmo =Before the costume= This cougar was donated by the class of 1965 and stands outside LaVell Edwards Stadium. =Cosmo comes to life= On October 15, 1953, Cosmo made his first appearance in front of BYU fans. Dwayne Stevenson, the pep chairman of BYU, bought the costume for $73 and persuaded his roommate Daniel T. Gallego to wear it and thus become the first Cosmo. The name Cosmo derives from the word \\"cosmopolitan\\" and was chosen because BYU had recently been selected as a Cosmopolitan school. Cosmo became immediately popular, and since Gallego many people have been Cosmo, including BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson, who once put on the costume at a pep rally. LaVell Edwards, the legendary football coach for the Cougars, wore the Cosmo costume during the final season basketball game against Utah in 1981 for the unveiling of that year's Cosmo, Brian Larney (In Dec. 1980 the Cougars beat SMU in the \\"Miracle Bowl\\" led by Jim McMahon in San Diego) (The Basketball team led by Danny Ainge went on to the NCAA Tourney and beat UCLA and then Notre Dame in the final seconds.) =Cosmo undergoes cosmetic surgery= On September 2, 1997, BYU's Athletic Media Relations announced that while hunting Red Tail Hawks (rival Utah's mascot) in Rock Canyon, Cosmo fell 100 feet. Several students saw the fall, however, and called Utah Valley Search and Rescue, which performed emergency surgery on Cosmo. This included reduction in head size, which allowed Cosmo more range in motion and the ability to perform more daring stunts. Cosmo frequently does flips, walks on stilts, rides motorcycles, and performs slam dunks in order to please the crowd. It was remarked once on ESPN that Cosmo was \\"probably the most athletic mascot in college basketball.\\" =Cosmo today= This van includes a 1600-watt, 12-speaker stereo system, a dance stage on top, a basketball hoop, a variety of specialty lights (on the top), a fog machine, several sirens, and a cordless public address system. Cosmo's workload of performances at more than 450 functions a year necessitates that there be more than one Cosmo at a time. A team of people, Team Cosmo, helps him with his antics.

History The church was completed on July 30, 2000, and was a gift from Norway to Iceland in connection with the millennial anniversary of the conversion of Iceland to Christianity by Olav Tryggvason in the year 1000. Developing from a suggestion by the Icelandic government, the Norwegian state presented Iceland with a replica of the Haltdalen Stave Church (Haltdalen stavkirke), originally from around the 1170s. The first church known on Iceland was a post church and not a stave church. The replica was erected by the harbour of Vestmannaeyjab√¶r in the Vestmannaeyjar, in an area formed by the lava of the 1973 eruption of Eldfell. The replica was undertaken by the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research as a three-year research and reconstruction project from 1998 to 2000 under the leadership of professor Elisabeth Seip, Head of Research at the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research. The church was constructed at Lom from materials deliberately drawn widely from around Norway, including timber from R√∏ros, shingles from Odalen, tar from Skj√•k, wrought iron from V√•g√•, and a doorstep from Holt√•len. A gallery was added around the outside of the building, inspired by other stave churches, to provide the building with extra strength against the stormy weather of the Vestmannaeyjar. The church was built and consecrated in summer 2000, and was completed on 30 July 2000. The project was supported by a Norwegian government grant of 5.5m Norwegian kroner; Icelandic government funding for the redevelopment of the Skansinn area of Vestmannaeyjarb√¶r as a heritage area; and some private sponsorship was also involved, most importantly that the Icelandic company Eimskip shipped the church to Iceland for free.Paul Torvik Nilsen, 'Colourful Middle Ages', Tell'us: Science in Norway (December 2001), 6‚Äì9. The National Church of Norway also gave an altar piece. It is replica of the St Olav frontal, one of the finest surviving medieval Norwegian works of art, undertaken under the leadership of Terje Nordsted.

Retrieved June 18, 2009. Among the 300 albums are the covers of Magical Mystery Tour by the Beatles, Crown of Creation by Jefferson Airplane, Exile on Main Street by the Rolling Stones, and Hotter Than Hell by Kiss. His first major assignment, in 1963, was designing the poster for the surf film The Endless Summer, after which he served as Capitol Records' head of design from 1965 to 1968. During that time, he worked on the artwork for albums by Capitol artists such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys. He also oversaw the design of the psychedelic posters for the Pinnacle Shrine exposition.  Album covers  Among his most notable album covers are: *Magical Mystery Tour by the Beatles *Wild Honey by the Beach Boys *Crown of Creation by Jefferson Airplane *Exile on Main Street by the Rolling Stones * Volume 3: A Child's Guide to Good and Evil by the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band *Vincebus Eruptum by Blue Cheer *Skeletons in the Closet by the Grateful Dead *Hotter Than Hell by Kiss *Eat to the Beat by Blondie *Retro Hash by Asher Roth *Get Hurt by the Gaslight Anthem *Altered State by Altered State *Signs of Life by Billy Squier  Film posters  The Endless Summer film poster, 1966 In 1963, Van Hamersveld was hired by director and filmmaker Bruce Brown to design the iconic Endless Summer movie poster using a photograph taken by Bob Bagley, general manager and camera man for Bruce Brown Films. In the staged photograph originally taken at Salt Creek, Brown is positioned in the foreground with his surfboard on his head and the movie's two stars, Robert August and Mike Hynson, between Brown and the setting sun. He had learned this technique at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where he took night classes, graduating later that year. He converted the photo into an abstract design by reducing each color to a single tone and giving each image a single, hard edge.  Other work  He designed an official poster and 360-foot-long mural for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games; illustrations for Esquire, Rolling Stone, Billboard; and branding and logos for Fatburger, Contempo Casuals, and Broadway Deli.  Later projects  In 1997 Van Hamersveld started his own line of products revisiting his work from 1964 to 1974, which he calls \\"Post-Future\\". With the printmaking of a fine art edition of the Endless Summer poster, he moved his design work into his Coolhous studio in Santa Monica and between analog and digital environments managed to create works such as the posters for the 2005 Cream reunion concert at the Royal Albert Hall. In 2013 he celebrated 50 years in graphic design by producing a vinyl EP sleeve for Liverpool-based blues- rockers Sankofa, in addition to publishing the book John Van Hamersveld‚ÄîCoolhaus Studio: 50 Years of Graphic Design. He continued that line of work in 2014 with two more artworks for records by Asher Roth and the Gaslight Anthem. In April 2018 Van Hamersveld completed a mural on a storage tank near Grand Avenue in El Segundo, California. \\"El Segundo is where my career started, as a surfer and an artist,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times.

Pantell) of Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics (Wiley, 1969), published in English, French, Russian and Chinese. Puthoff published papers on polarizable vacuum (PV) and stochastic electrodynamics topics, which are examples of alternative approaches to general relativity and quantum mechanics. Puthoff took an interest in the Church of Scientology in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top OT VII level by 1971. Puthoff wrote up his \\"wins\\" for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved \\"remote viewing\\" abilities.Puthoff, Hal, Success Story, Scientology Advanced Org Los Angeles (AOLA) special publication, 1971. In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology's Celebrity magazine, stating that Scientology had given him \\"a feeling of absolute fearlessness\\".Celebrity magazine, Minor Issue 9, February 1974. Puthoff severed all connection with Scientology in the late 1970s.Harold Puthoff, \\"Harold Puthoff Responds on Zero-Point Energy,\\" Skeptical Inquirer, September/October1998. In the 1970s and '80s Puthoff directed a CIA/DIA-funded program at SRI International to investigate paranormal abilities, collaborating with Russell Targ in a study of the purported psychic abilities of Uri Geller, Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Joseph McMoneagle and others, as part of the Stargate Project. Both Puthoff and Targ became convinced Geller and Swann had genuine psychic powers.Russell Targ, Harold Puthoff. (2005). Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities. Hampton Roads Publishing Company. However, Geller employed sleight of hand tricks.Ben Harris. (1985). Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect. Calgary: Micky Hades International. In 1985, Puthoff founded a for-profit company, EarthTech International in Austin, Texas. At about the same time, he founded an organization, Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (IASA), also in Austin, Texas, where he is Director.Harold Puthoff at the Parapsychological Association Independent of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, IASA pursues ideas that Puthoff finds interesting specifically related to energy generation and space propulsion, with funding from anonymous donors. Puthoff and EarthTech were granted a US Patent 5,845,220 in 1998 after five years delay. The claims were disputed that information could be transmitted through a distance using a modulated potential with no electric or magnetic field components. The case is used for educational purposes in patent law as an example of a valid patent where \\"The lesson of the Puthoff patent is that in a world where both types of patents are more and more common, even a competent examiner may fail to distinguish innovation from pseudoscience.\\" Assessment of scholarship Uri Geller was studied by Russell Targ and Puthoff at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Targ and Puthoff declared to have demonstrated that Geller had genuine psychic powers, though it was reported that there were flaws with the controls in the experiments and Geller was caught using sleight of hand on many other occasions.James Randi. (1982). The Truth about Uri Geller. Prometheus Books.Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins. Joseph Henry Press. p. 163. \\"In reality, however, Geller, an experienced magician and showman, simply bends the objects when no one is watching. But, you may argue, millions of people were watching him on TV! Geller is a master at an essential tool of the magician: misdirection or distracting peoples' attention. He is quite good at projecting an air of innocence that belies his actions. That he can fool so many people is a tribute to slight-of-hand (sic) artistry, not psychic power.\\" According to Terence Hines: The psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff's remote viewing experiments. In a series of thirty-five studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates.David Marks, Richard Kammann. (1978). Information transmission in remote viewing experiments. Nature 274: 680‚Äì81.David Marks. (1981). Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments. Nature 292: 177. Terence Hines has written: According to Marks, when the cues were eliminated the results fell to a chance level.David Marks, Richard Kammann. (1980). The Psychology of the Psychic. Prometheus Books. James Randi noted that controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.James Randi. (1997). \\"Remote viewing\\" in An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. St. Martin's Griffin. Marks and Kamman concluded: \\"Until remote viewing can be confirmed in conditions which prevent sensory cueing the conclusions of Targ and Puthoff remain an unsubstantiated hypothesis.\\"C. E. M. Hansel. (1980). ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Reevaluation.

Churchill was also a Baptist lay preacher. Early life and Hantsport years Ezra Churchill was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, the son of Ezra Churchill and Elizabeth Trefry. In 1824, Churchill married Ann Davison and subsequently, after Ann‚Äôs death, married Rachel Burgess. His move to the eastern end of the Annapolis Valley came with the purchase of a sixty-six acre lot at Hantsport in 1841 from Robert Barker, son of Edward Baker, the founder of the town. He enlarged his landholdings in the area and over the years sold lots to workmen and their families who are moving to Hantsport for the jobs being created by the shipbuilding boom. Although Hantsport and area had been the location of a number of shipbuilding ventures, Churchill was the catalyst that transformed a small gathering of farms along the confluence of the Halfway and Avon rivers into a major shipbuilding port. Nearly two hundred vessels were built in the Hantsport area shipyards. Churchill became one of the largest shipbuilders and ship investors in Nova Scotia, launching dozens of large sailing vessels from his yards at Hantsport, as well as from Parrsboro, Canning, Newport, etc. Amongst his many vessels was the barque Hamburg, the largest three-masted sailing barque ever built in Canada. Not to be content with ships, Ezra purchased timberlands and built sawmills, producing timber and planking for the construction of his ships and lumber for the export trade. With gypsum deposits located nearby in the Windsor area he invested in the development of mines. The production from his mills and mines certainly became cargos for the outbound sailing of some of his vessels. Owning and operating ships was a risky business and in 1851 he became a founding investor in the Avon Marine Insurance Company. In 1870 or 1871 he operated the Evangeline Hotel, one of five hotels in the booming town of Hantsport. Political life Churchill House, Hantsport His political life began in 1855 when he was elected to represent Falmouth township in the Provincial Assembly holding his seat until the abolishment of the seat in 1859 when new electoral boundary districts were formed. Churchill won and held the new district, North Division of Hants County, from 1859 to 1867. During the debates over the idea of a Canadian confederation, Churchill remained pragmatic. During the contentious debates over the idea of confederation, a number of representatives broached the idea of annexation to the United States. To this Church is said to have stated \\"...what part of the States should we be annexed to - the North or the South? I always regretted that Halifax as well as New Brunswick, gave its sympathy to the South.Robertson, Allen B. Tide & Timber - Hantsport , Nova Scotia, 1795-1995. Lancelot Press, Hantsport, 1995. He eventually backed the idea of a national confederation, supporting Joseph Howe's efforts for better terms before Nova Scotia's accepted Sir John A. Macdonald's plan. In light of his long service to Nova Scotia and to the young Canada, Churchill was appointed on February 3, 1871 to the Senate, representing the Liberal-Conservative Party. Later life and death In 1871 Churchill and his wife moved to Windsor after purchasing Clifton House, the former property of the judge and writer, Thomas Chandler Haliburton. Ezra Churchill was certainly a man of some note and power, so much so that he played host to HRH, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (Edward VII) during his visits to Hantsport in 1860. The Prince's royal yacht Styx docked at Hantsport to transport him to and from New Brunswick. The new railway lines had only been completed to Windsor, therefore Churchill provided his personal carriages to the Prince and his party for the short journey to the railway terminus. He died in office in Ottawa in 1874. His daughter Elizabeth married Douglas Benjamin Woodworth. His daughter Bessie married Judson Burpee Black, Windsor, Nova Scotia. Churchill built a large Italianate mansion in Hantsport for his son John Wiley Churchill which was known as \\"The Cedars\\". The house is preserved today as the Churchill House museum and community centre.

Pellet mills are unlike grinding mills, in that they combine small materials into a larger, homogeneous mass, rather than break large materials into smaller pieces. Types There are many types of pellet mills that can be generally grouped into large-scale and small-scale types. According to the production capacity, pellet mills also can be divided into flat die pellet mill and ring die pellet mill. =Large-scale= Pellet mills There are two common types of large-scale pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is introduced to the top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the die. In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die. Large scale pellet mills are usually used to produce animal feed, wood pellets, and fuel pellets for use in a pellet stove. =Small-scale= A screw-type pellet mill Small-scale mills are usually variations of screw presses or hydraulic presses. The same basic process is used for both types. A die, also known as a mold, holds the uncompressed powder in a shaped pocket. The pocket shape defined the final pellet shape. A platen is attached to the end of the screw (in a screw press) or the ram (in a hydraulic press) which compresses the powder. Some platens are heated to speed up the time it takes and improve the overall structure of the pellet. They may also have water ports for quick cooling between uses.  Applications  One of the more common applications is to produce KBr pellets which are used in infrared spectroscopy applications. Animal feed pellets are usually a mixture of dry powdered feedstock, such as flour, sawdust, or grass, and a wet ingredient, such as molasses or steam. Feedstocks for pellet mills can sometimes break down and then re-form, or polymerize, under the extreme heat and pressure of the pellet mill.

She is a 2-8-0, 'Consolidation' class of steam locomotive built for branch line railways. Originally a coal burner, she was converted to burn oil in 1954, and retired from active duty in 1958. 2141 was sold to the City of Kamloops in 1961, and placed on display in Riverside Park until restoration work began in 1995. The restoration was completed in 2001, and 2141 has been working for KHR from May until December each year since. A second restoration took place from 2013 to 2015, with the engine running again in August 2015. The locomotive was featured in the movie Gold (2013) Tickets for excursions are sold at the ticket office, located at #3-510 Lorne Street, right across from the old Kamloops railway station.

Including Hellstrom, Jennifer Kale, Morbius, Werewolf by Night, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Riders Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze, the team first appeared in Ghost Rider (vol. 3) #28 (August 1992). From December 1993‚ÄìAugust 1994, Marvel branded all stories involving the group with a distinct family imprint and cover treatment. Publication history The Midnight Sons appeared in several 1990s multi-issue crossovers of Marvel's supernatural titles. The first, \\"Rise of the Midnight Sons,\\" launched several books in the Midnight Sons line, including Morbius (Sept. 1992), Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins (Oct. 1992), and Nightstalkers (Nov. 1992). The group appeared in the nine-issue anthology comic book Midnight Sons Unlimited, which ran from April 1993 to May 1995. Their final crossover was the seventeen-part \\"Siege of Darkness\\" which ran from December 1993 to January 1994. It was featured in two consecutive issues of each Midnight Sons title as well as four issues of Marvel Comics Presents (#143-146), and two issues of Doctor Strange, a title that was newly included in the line. It was advertised with an eight-page insert in several comics in October, November, and December 1993. According to the text of the advertisement, written by Jeffrey Lee Simmons, The advertisement also claimed the Midnight Sons was the \\"first distinct family group.\\" \\"Siege of Darkness,\\" however, marked the cancellation of Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins, and the Midnight Sons brand did not last much longer. Nightstalkers only lasted three more issues. A Blade and Blaze series failed to catch interest. The Midnight Sons logo was eventually dropped from the remaining titles, cover- dated September 1994, although Morbius, Blade, Blaze, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider (vol. 3), Marvel Comics Presents and the final three issues of Midnight Sons Unlimited continued on under the normal Marvel logo. The Marvel Edge imprint debuted in 1995, incorporating some of the same ongoing titles as Midnight Sons, including Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme and Ghost Rider. A different incarnation of the team was featured in Marvel Zombies 3 and in Marvel Zombies 4, debuting in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In February 2017, Moon Knight artist Greg Smallwood expressed interest in a revamped version of the Midnight Sons, featuring a team composed of Moon Knight, Blade, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, and Hannibal King. Fictional team biography =Rise of the Midnight Sons= The team was formed by Ghost Riders, Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze after Ghost Rider received a vision in which he learned that Lilith, Mother of All Demons (not Dracula's daughter, another Marvel character of the same name) was being resurrected and posed a great threat. She planned to use her demon children, the Lilin, to take over Earth. Though Lilith had many children, she had four children who were very loyal to her. Their names were Pilgrim, Nakota, Meatmarket, and the most powerful of the four, Blackout, Ghost Rider's old enemy (Blackout was not an actual child of Lilith originally, but rather a grandchild. He was later killed and Lilith gave birth to Blackout along with her other children, thus indeed making him one of her actual children). Though she would have a lot more of her children to help her, the rest had forsaken Lilith. After she was imprisoned, many of the Lilin were either scattered or killed. Those who were scattered forgot the ways of Lilith and moved on with their lives, except Lilith's most faithful servants. The team consisted of the Nightstalkers (Eric Brooks / Blade, Frank Drake and Hannibal King), Morbius, the Living Vampire, the Spirits of Vengeance (Danny Ketch / Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider, and later Michael Badilino / Vengeance), and the Darkhold Redeemers (Sam Buchanan, Victoria Montesi, Louise Hastings, and later Modred the Mystic and Jinx). While secretly assembling the team and the sub-teams within, from behind the scenes, Doctor Strange didn't officially join the team until the Siege of Darkness storyline. =Midnight Massacre= The second major meeting between the Midnight Sons occurred when Blade, with a page from the Darkhold, became the demonic creature Switchblade. He killed most of the Midnight Sons, subsequently taking on the power and weapons of each. He was finally stopped when Louise Hastings used a counter spell from the Darkhold. =Siege of Darkness= The \\"Siege of Darkness\\" consisted of two subsequent stories in which the Midnight Sons fought groups connected with the two major villains, Lilith and Zarathos. In the first story arc, covers were black with vague outlines, and the Midnight Sons fought the Lilin who were invading the earth in a mysterious smoke emanating from Cypress Hills Cemetery. Lilin included in this arc include Bad Timing, Martine Bancroft, Blackout, Dark Legion, Meatmarket, Nakota, Outcast, Pilgrim, Sister Nil, Stonecold, and Bloodthirst, who was possessing Morbius. In the second story arc, covers featured a dripping blood design, and the Midnight Sons fought The Fallen, a group loyal to Zarathos. The Fallen include Atrocity, Embyrre, Metarchus, Patriarch, and Salom√©. The Lilin At the beginning of the story, Ghost Rider and Blaze tell The Nightstalkers, The Darkhold Redeemers, and Morbius that they have killed Lilith and Zarathos. The Nightstalkers, who are skeptical, investigate but find mist containing Lilin now emanating from Cypress Hills Cemetery.Nightstalkers (vol. 1) #14 (Dec. 1993) As the other Midnight Sons join the fight, they discover that, instead of killing Lilith and Zarathos, Ghost Rider and Blaze have opened a portal to Shadowside where the Lilin had been exiled. They split into two groups, one led by Ghost Rider and one led by Morbius. Caretaker, Doctor Strange and Vengeance also join the fight. Caretaker claims Zarathos is more powerful and they must protect the Medallion of Power. Doctor Strange teleports Ghost Rider's group to his Sanctum Sanctorum.Ghost Rider (vol. 2) #44 (Dec. 1993) They find out from some Lilin that Morbius‚Äô team has a traitor.Marvel Comics Presents (vol. 1) #143 (Early December 1993) The team following Morbius, which includes Louise Hastings, hide out in one of Morbius‚Äô old labs. Louise Hastings finds out Morbius has been infected by Lilin blood, and Morbius secretly kills her. Morbius has been taken over by the Lilin Bloodthirst.Darkhold (vol. 1) #15 (Dec. 1993) He then requests entry into Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum. Unaware that Morbius has been possessed, Doctor Strange allows him to enter which allows other Lilin to follow. Doctor Strange convinces Morbius to fight the control of Bloodthirst.Morbius: The Living Vampire (vol. 1) #16 (Dec. 1993) Doctor Strange then casts a spell that causes the Sanctum Sanctorum to explode.Doctor Strange (vol. 3) #60 (Dec. 1993) The Spirits of Vengeance then confront Lilith and Zarathos in Cypress Hills Cemetery and use the Medallion of Power to send Lilith and the Lilin back to Shadowside. The Medallion of Power disappears.Spirits of Vengeance (vol. 1) #17 (Dec. 1993) The Fallen After Lilith is exiled, it appears as if a group called The Fallen, loyal to Zarathos, has returned from exile. The Fallen are an offshoot of The Blood, the group to which Caretaker belongs. The Fallen left The Blood to follow the wizard Zarathos. The Fallen quickly beat the Midnight Sons and take Caretaker captive.Nightstalkers (vol. 1) #15 (Jan. 1994) The Midnight Sons regroup at The Nightclub, and Caretaker sends a message that The Fallen plan to recruit or kill surviving members of The Blood.Ghost Rider (vol. 2) #45 (Jan. 1994) The Midnight Sons then find James Raydar, Patriarch and Truthsayer with varying degrees of success; Patriarch joins Zarathos, Truthsayer is killed by Modred, and James Raydar joins the Midnight Sons along with Embyrre, Raydar's daughter and one of The Fallen who turns against Zarathos when she sees Morbius‚Äô nobility.Darkhold (vol. 1) #16 (Jan. 1994)Morbius: The Living Vampire (vol. 1) #17 (Jan. 1994) Meanwhile, Victoria Montesi finds out that she has been impregnated with Chthon.Marvel Comics Presents (vol. 1) #145 (Early January 1994) Doctor Strange helps her just as he is being attacked by Salom√©, one of The Fallen, who claims she is the rightful Sorceress Supreme. Doctor Strange disappears into another dimension and places Victoria Montesi in a mystical stasis. In his place appears Strange, a mystical construct Doctor Strange based loosely on himself. Strange joins the rest of the Midnight Sons in the fight against The Fallen. Ghost Rider confronts Zarathos one on one, and Ghost Rider is apparently destroyed and his power absorbed into Zarathos.Spirits of Vengeance (vol. 1) #18 (Jan. 1994) The Midnight Sons then fight Patriarch, Metarchus, and Atrocity to a standstill, and the Fallen retreat. Caretaker reveals that there is one more member of The Blood they have not contacted, Foundry. The Midnight Sons track down Foundry who gives them a sword called Justiciar. She claims it must be tempered in her own blood and sacrifices herself. Blade then uses Justiciar to kill Patriarch, Metarchus and Atrocity with the help of the other Midnight Sons. They believe the destruction of The Fallen will weaken Zarathos. They attack Zarathos directly. Embyrre and James Raydar also attack and are killed. Ghost Rider, whose spirit was absorbed by Zarathos, now apparently attacks him from within and Blade stabs Zarathos with Justiciar. Zarathos, with the sword through his chest, turns to stone. Johnny Blaze, Vengeance, Morbius, Blade, Hannibal King, Strange, and Caretaker then go through a ceremony in which they are branded with the symbol of the flaming dagger. Caretaker says they have become the successors to the original 'Order of the Midnight Sons' This brand is placed on the arms of all the members of the new team aside from Frank Drake, a member of the Nightstalkers and a human descendant of Dracula and the Ghost Rider who had apparently been destroyed. Drake was disallowed from taking the brand due to his relative normalcy compared to the other members who were supernaturally afflicted and destined to be outsiders. He was allowed, however, to be an associate member.Midnight Sons Unlimited (vol. 1) #4 (Jan. 1994) =Marvel Zombies= A new Midnight Sons team is sanctioned by A.R.M.O.R., a government agency that monitors and polices alternate realities from Earth-616. The team is chosen by Morbius, who enlists Daimon \\"Hellstorm\\" Hellstrom (aka; the Son of Satan), Jennifer Kale, Man-Thing, and Werewolf by Night to contain the zombie virus outbreak from further spreading into the 616 universe. The team makes a brief appearance at the end of Marvel Zombies 3 and fully appears in Marvel Zombies 4. =Damnation= During the Damnation storyline, Wong and the ghost of Doctor Strange's dog Bats assembled Blade, Doctor Voodoo, Elsa Bloodstone, Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, and Man-Thing to form the latest incarnation of the Midnight Sons so that they could help Doctor Strange fight Mephisto's forces in Las Vegas.Doctor Strange: Damnation #1 (February 14, 2017).

Liardet (1840) Tullamareena (or Tullamarine, Dullamarin) was a senior man of the Wurundjeri, a Koori, (Aboriginal) people of the Melbourne area, at the time of the British settlement in Victoria, Australia, in 1835. He is believed to have been present at the signing of John Batman's land deal in 1835. He was known to have been a resistor to British occupation of Wurundjeri lands. He was described by the Reverend George Langhorne, an early Port Phillip missionary as \\"a steady, industrious man\\". On 25 April 1838 he was arrested for sheep- stealing from John Gardiner's property in Hawthorn. During his imprisonment he escaped and as a consequence burnt down the first Melbourne gaol along with his friends Moonee Moonee and Jin Jin. William Lonsdale, the first Police magistrate of Melbourne wrote in a letter to the colonial secretary on 26 April 1838: > ...I was at first apprehensive that some of the blacks had set the gaol on > fire...for the purpose of liberating the three who were confined, but to > ascertain what I could on this point, I went as soon as I was satisfied that > the stores and prisoners were temporarily disposed of after their being > taken from the buildings, into the different camps of blacks, of which there > were three in the neighbourhood... Describing how the gaol was set fire to, > he says that the other black who was confined with him got a long piece of > reed which he thrust through an opening in the partition between the place > where he was confined in and the guard room, and after lighting the reed by > the guard's candle he drew it back and set fire to the thatch roof. The two > blacks got off but one was afterwards retaken, viz. Jin Jin. This affair is > much to be regretted, keeping up as it undoubtedly will the public alarm and > agitation regarding the blacks. Tullamareena was later recaptured and sent for trial in Sydney by ship. His trial was terminated when it was established he was unable to understand English. He was set free more than 700km from his home and no records indicate further colonial contact. It is told in Sunbury that upon release he walked back all the way home - to the region around Tullamarine / Bulla / Sunbury. He has a Melbourne suburb, its airport and the freeway named after him.

The zhongruan has a straight neck with 24 frets on the fingerboard and 4 strings. It is usually played with a plectrum (guitar pick). It can also be played with fingers (index finger and thumb with acrylic nails), which is similar to the way of playing the pipa (ÁêµÁê∂). The zhongruan is a tenor-ranged instrument in the family of ruan (ÈòÆ). In ancient China, the ruan was called Qin pipa (Qin [Dynasty] pipa, Áß¶ÁêµÁê∂) or Ruan xian (ÈòÆÂí∏). Now the ruan has expanded to different sizes and the zhongruan is the \\"medium\\" one. Zhongruan Use The default tuning of zhongruan is G2-D3-G3-D4. It can also be tuned as G2-D3-A3-E4, A2-D3-D3-D4, and other variants, according to requirements in music scores.‰∏≠ÈòÆÁöÑ‰∏âÁßçÂÆöÂº¶ÊñπÊ≥ï , ‰∫¨ÂâßËÆ∫Âùõ, accessed January 4, 2012 Since the zhongruan has a rounded, calm and rich tone, it is usually played as a lead instrument in small ensembles and used to accompany other instruments in Chinese orchestra.Learning Music - Ruan , Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, accessed October 20, 2009. It can also be played solo. Construction A good quality zhongruan is usually made of rosewood (Á¥ÖÊú®). For the best sound quality and visual appearance, it is made of red sandalwood (Á¥´Ê™ÄÊú®), because red sandalwood is best known for its beautiful wood grain, unique purplish color, hardness and rareness. Therefore, a red sandalwood made zhongruan is heavier and more expensive. The lute head (Áê¥È†≠) is for decoration. Three common decorative patterns are ruyi (Â¶ÇÊÑè, good fortune), peony and dragon. They are usually made of plastic or ivory. Under the lute head is a pegbox (Âº¶Ëª∏ÁÆ±) with tuning pegs (Áê¥Ê†ì) that hold the strings. The pegs are usually made of wood or buffalo horn. Nowadays, most zhongruans have tuning machine heads (Âº¶Èàï) instead of a peg box, since they make it easier to tune. There are some makers that still use the traditional peg box system but coupled with fine tuners at the tailpiece. The strings (Âº¶) were made of silk in the old times. The number of strands of silk determined the thickness of the string. Nowadays, metal wound polymer strings are used.Shen, Sin-Yan (1991). Chinese Music and Orchestration: A Primer on Principles and Practice, p. 107. Chinese Music Society of North America, Woodridge. October 19, 2009. A nut (Â±±Âè£) is placed between the pegbox and the neck to secure the strings. It is usually made of plastic, buffalo bone or ivory. The neck (Áê¥È†∏) connects the lute head and the body. It has a fingerboard (ÊåáÊùø) and 24 frets (ÂìÅ). The frets are usually made of plastic, buffalo bone, wood and metal (copper). For a good quality zhongruan, the frets are made of a combination of plastic and copper, or wood and copper, with the metal part inlaid at the top of each fret. In combining two materials, the frets last without damaging from long-time practice. The circular sound box (ÂÖ±È≥¥ÁÆ±) body is made of a combination of front board, back board and side board.

It features Illinois Caverns which is alternatively known as Mammoth Cave of Illinois (also Burksville Cave, Egyptian Cave, Eckert Cave). Illinois Caverns is the second-largest cave in Illinois and has more than 9.6 km of passages. The cave has a constant temperature of , and portions flood during wet weather. Passages can be high and just as wide. It is located off Illinois Route 3, south of Waterloo, near the unincorporated community of Burksville. History What is now known as Illinois Caverns hosted its first paying customers in March 1901, operated by a Mr. White of East Saint Louis. It is the only cave in Illinois to have been commercially operated, attracting many visitors from St. Louis during the 1904 World's Fair. However the cave was never considered a commercial success (it closed in 1907), and had remained almost completely unimproved, excepting the extant concrete entrance stairs and a single ladder. When the cave and environs were sold to the State of Illinois in 1985, care of the site was entrusted to Armin Krueger, until his death. Geology The cave was, and in fact still is being formed in the Mississippian limestone (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) (or karst common to the region) by water dissolution, and includes cave formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, rimstone dams, flowstone, and soda straws. The cavern is a branchwork type cave, which generally consists of a central cavern and stream with smaller passages and tributaries branching off. Numerous circular, crater-like depressions are evident in the area surrounding the entrance, easily visible from the air or space.\\"satellite view, Google Maps\\" These are typical of both the area and karst topography in general Cave fauna Fauna in the cave includes bats, salamanders, frogs, crickets, amphipods, and isopods. Illinois Caverns is home to the federal endangered species Gammarus acherondytes (a.k.a. Illinois Cave Amphipod). This species of amphipod is found nowhere else in the world except a few neighboring caves located in the southwestern Illinois karst. Visitation The cave has been closed for visitors since early 2010 to stop the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats. Persons desiring to enter the cave need a permit; see official web site below for more information. A minimum of four people per party is needed for entrance into the cave. Each person needs to have a hardhat, boots, sturdy clothing, and three sources of light. At times some portions of the cave may be off-limits, these areas should be clearly marked. To reach Illinois Caverns from the north, take Route 3 south past Waterloo about two miles, make a right on Kaskaskia Road. In Burksville, make a left onto KK Road heading east, then a right on G Road, the entrance is on the right, about two and a quarter miles south of KK Road. From Red Bud, take Route 3 north for about five miles and make a left onto II Road. Bearing left at Sportsmans Road, proceeding through Tipton and bearing right at the Y intersection with R Road, to remain on II Road for about five miles, until it crosses G Road. Make a right and the entrance will be on the left, less than a mile north of II Road.

She is the lead composer at the Akademie Schloss Solitude Sommerakademie, a biannual international academy of composers and resident musicians at the landmark Schlo√ü Solitude, in Stuttgart, Germany. She has also taught at the international summer school Syntethis in Poland. She is a 2011 Guggenheim Fellow. Education and early career Czernowin was born and raised in Haifa, Israel. She studied composition at the Rubin Academy of Music at Tel-Aviv University with Abel Ehrlich and Izhak Sadai, and at the age of 25 went to study in Berlin on a DAAD Scholarship with Dieter Schnebel. In 1986 she moved to the United States to study at Bard College with Eli Yarden and Joan Tower. She received her PhD at the University of California San Diego studying with Roger Reynolds (dissertation advisor) and Brian Ferneyhough. Upon completing her formal education, Czernowin undertook a period of travel and composition in Japan 1993-5 (Asahi Shimbun Fellowship, NEA Scholarship) and Germany (1996, Akademie Schlo√ü Solitude). Czernowin describes this period of travel as being seminal in the development of her compositional language. Czernowin considers teaching to be an important aspect of her continued compositional development. She was Professor of Composition at the University of California San Diego from 1997 to 2006, a professor at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna from 2006 to 2009, and in 2009 was appointed Walter Bigelow Rosen Professor of Music at Harvard University. She has been a guest professor in a number of institutions, and has taught at the International Summer Course for New Music at Darmstadt since 1990. In 2003 Czernowin founded a course for young composers at the Akademie Schloss Solitude near Stuttgart with her husband, composer Steven Kazuo Takasugi, and Jean Baptiste Joly, as well as a course in Israel at the festival Tzlil Meudcan along with Yaron Deutsch. Musical work Czernowin's output includes chamber and orchestral music, with and without electronics. Her works have been regularly played in most of the contemporary music festivals in Europe, as well as in Japan, Korea, Australia, the US and Canada. =Opera= Czernowin has composed three large scale works for the stage: Pnima ... ins Innere (2000), Adama (2004-05), and Infinite now (2016‚Äì17). All three carry strong political content. A fourth work, Heart Chamber, is set to premiere in late 2019. Pnima ... ins Innere was commissioned by the Munich Biennale and chosen as best premiere of the year by Opernwelt's annual critic survey. It was also winner of the coveted Bayerischer Theaterpreis. Pnima deals with the transmission of a traumatic experience as a vital part of the present, demanding real and active engagement rather than allowing the trauma to become a self-important, rarefied and frozen memorial. Adama was commissioned for Mozart's 250th birthday by the Salzburg Festival. With her second opera, Czernowin was asked to respond to Mozart's Za√Øde by creating a counterpoint piece. Adama, which is intertwined with Za√Øde, deals with the impact that a political situation has on the individual and the limited freedom one has when trying to escape this impact. Infinite now was commissioned by Vlaamse opera Antwerp and Ghent, Belgium, Mannheim Stadttheater, Germany, and IRCAM Paris. It was directed by Luk Perceval, staged by Phillip Bussmann, and conducted by Titus Engel. IRCAM and Carlo Laurenzi were in collaboration with Czernowin for the electronics. The opera uses two texts, Homecoming by Chinese writer Can Xue, and Front by Luk Perceval (a play based on Erich Maria Remarque's All is Quiet on the Western Front, as well as the letters of soldiers from the first world war). A two-and-a-half hour, 6 act work, Infinite Now moves beyond the topics of Homecoming and Front and into the greater sphere of existence here and now. The nature and destiny of survival, as well as the vitality involved in it, are overarching themes of the opera. Heart Chamber for Deutsche Oper Berlin ‚Äî like Infinite Now ‚Äî features vocalists, instrumental soloists (saxophone, guitar, keyboard, percussion, double bass), orchestra, electronics, and with the addition of a 16-piece choir. The opera follows two protagonists (soprano and baritone), and according to the composer 'zooms in and follows the beginning of love'. The opera is directed by Claus Guth while Czernowin provides the text. Structurally, Heart Chamber presents Czernowin's exploration of a new 'fluid form (fluid identity)'. =Chamber and orchestral works=  1990s  Similarly to the political rebelliousness of the operas, Czernowin's chamber music enacts an impatience with known and accepted assumptions. Her early chamber pieces from the 1990s explore the possibilities of temporal and formal divergence. In both Afatsim (1996) and String Quartet (1995), a game is made of changing the identity of the instruments by creating \\"meta instruments\\" ‚Äì combining a few instruments into one identity and then separating them. By doing so the ensemble is able to change its identity within the piece. The unfolding of the piece is further fractured by cutting and displacing parts of the continuity into a forest of chaotic utterances. The Wintersongs series uses the same septet material reinterpreted five times, becoming an entirely different musical experience with each iteration.  2000s  Maim (2001‚Äì07), for a large orchestra and a group of soloists, and other works from the 2000s including the electronic works of the experimental studio, speculate about the physicality and motion of material. They touch on a strange and unfamiliar kind of \\"physics\\", which toys with our expectations.  2010s  The exploration of time and form on the one hand, and of material, its nature and physicality on the other, find a new expression in HIDDEN (2013‚Äì14) for string quartet and electronics, where a slowed down experience of time is coupled with distorted reflections of material, showing a glimpse into a world of unfamiliarity.  Awards  Czernowin has received numerous awards for her compositions, including the Kranichsteiner Musikpreis (1992), Asahi Shimbun Fellowship Prize (1993), the Schlo√ü Solitude Fellowship (1996), the IRCAM Reading Panel (1998), the Composer's Prize by the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation (2003), the Rockefeller Foundation Prize (2004), the Fromm Foundation Award (2008), a nomination of the Berlin Wissenschaftskolleg (2008), the Guggenheim Fellowship Award (2011) and the Heidelberger K√ºnstlerinnenpreis (2016). She was Artist in Residence with the Salzburg Festival in 2005/06 and with the Lucerne Festival, Switzerland in 2013.

It has spread and become well-established in many other places, including North America, South America (Argentina and Chile), Australia, and New Zealand. German wasps are part of the family Vespidae and are sometimes mistakenly referred to as paper wasps because they build grey paper nests, although strictly speaking, paper wasps are part of the subfamily Polistinae. In North America, they are also known as yellowjackets. Taxonomy and phylogeny Vespula germanica belongs to the genus Vespula, which includes various species of social wasps that are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, these wasps are most commonly known as yellowjackets, but this name also applies to species within the sister genus Dolichovespula. Members of Vespula are often confused with other genera, especially the paper wasp Polistes dominula. Colonies of V. germanica share many characteristics with those of V. vulgaris (common wasp) and V. pensylvanica (western yellowjacket), so they are very often studied together. Description and identification The German wasp is about 13 mm (0.5 in) long, has a mass of 74.1 ¬± 9.6 mg, and has typical wasp colours of black and yellow. It is very similar to the common wasp (V. vulgaris), but unlike the common wasp, has three tiny black dots on the clypeus. To further complicate the issue this only applies to workers. It is best practice to first work out if your wasp is a worker, queen or drone before separating it into vulgaris vs germanica. German wasps also have black dots on their abdomens, while the common wasp's analogous markings are fused with the black rings above them, forming a different pattern. However, the identification of a wasp as V. vulgaris may be difficult because the normally unbroken black mark on its clypeus can sometimes appear broken, making it look extremely similar to V. germanica. Distribution and habitat V. germanica originated in Europe, Asia, and North Africa and can now be found in sections of every continent but Antarctica. It has established populations in North America, South America, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. German yellowjackets are known to be especially successful and destructive invaders of new territories. These wasps are polyphagous predators which feed on native arthropods, and because they are able to outdo many other animals for food, they have caused considerable harm to the indigenous wildlife of areas which they have invaded. For a given year, V. germanica disperses at distances of no more than 1000 m, so that their rapid dispersal is likely to be aided by accidental human transport of hibernating queens. This normally leads to a bottleneck effect during the establishment of new populations, which explains the significant genetic differentiation often found among geographically distant populations. The nest is made from chewed plant fibres, mixed with saliva. The majority of nests are found in the soil below ground. A significant portion of nests are found in artificial structures such as attics, and a small portion are found above ground. Colony cycle German wasp rasping wood with which to build its nest Macrophotography of queen of V. germanica in hibernation, awaiting spring to establish a new insect colony A single queen initiates a nest in the spring by constructing an embryonic nest, which contains a series of hexagonal cells. These cells are used to house one wasp through the immature stages of life: egg, larval instar, and pupa. The colony grows rapidly during the summer with a huge increase in worker numbers and nest size. By the end of summer, the rate of growth slows considerably and more males are produced than workers, and the focus is shifted from building small cells to building cells that are 30-40 percent larger. These new cells house the new queens and males. In the fall, the new queens begin hibernation, while the old queens die off and the colony collapses. In some cases, the nests may survive through the winter and reach the next season. If this occurs, the nest will become polygynous and reach a much larger size than in the previous year. V. germanica nests are strongly affected by climate. Average colonies in Australia contain over 9500 small workers and 3600 large queen and male cells. By the end of May, colonies in Australia have 15,000 wasps emerging from small cells and 2500 wasps emerging from the large cells. By comparison, nests in the British Isles only have 6100‚Äì6500 small cells and 1500 large cells on average, in roughly eight combs. Additionally, a significant number of nests in Australia are able to survive the winter, whereas in England none of the nests survive. This demonstrates how V. germanica nests can reach a substantial size in appropriate climate conditions. Behavior =Worker specialization= High variation in the sequence and diversity of tasks performed by V. germanica workers suggests limited temporal polyethism exists within the species. Temporal polyethism is a mechanism in which workers specialize on tasks in a sequential order throughout their lives, instead of performing numerous tasks concurrently. The typical order of tasks in V. germanica is nest work, pulp foraging, carbohydrate foraging and protein foraging. Approximately 61 percent of the wasps observed perform more than two of these tasks during their lifetimes. Additionally, about 40 percent of the wasps specialize on only one task per day, but these individuals varied with respect to age and sequence of task performance. The schedule of temporal polyethism found in V. germanica is highly accelerated when compared to other Hymenoptera, which is likely related to worker lifespan. Vespula workers may not live long enough to benefit from a strict system of worker specialization, in which workers repeatedly perform one task. =Mating behavior= Queen V. germanica and drone mating Vespula germanica queens are typically polyandrous. The queens mate with a moderate number of males, usually between one and seven, with no optimal number of mates. In addition, mating events are independent of each other, which discredits the hypothesis that queens terminate mating behavior after mating with a male that possesses an optimal set of attributes. V. germanica workers are unable to mate and so incapable of producing diploid offspring. In some nests, however, the workers produce male offspring. Worker reproduction has been documented in other Vespula wasp colonies, but usually only after the death of the queen. However, workers of V. germanica have been found reproducing in the presence of a queen. =Foraging behavior= Vespula germanica workers are known to be opportunistic predators and scavengers. They are efficient at hunting for small, live food sources and at collecting from large stationary sources. It is believed that the flexibility in V. germanica's foraging behavior is a key factor in their ability to rapidly colonize new areas in a variety of ecological environments. As scavengers, V. germanica are forced to make numerous trips between the location of the food source and the nest, where the larvae are kept and fed. This calls for V. germanica foragers to be adept at relocating earlier food sources. =Cognitive plasticity= The ability to relocate previously discovered food sources is only one example of the diverse cognitive mechanisms at play within V. germanica's behaviors. V. germanica foragers continue to visit a feeder after food removal, but are able to rapidly remove associations that no longer provide a reward. The amount of time that the foragers continue to search these sites depends on the number of times they had visited it in the past. The choices made by V. germanica take into account both current and past experiences. These abilities imply that these wasps have important learning and memory capacities which enable them to memorize various resource characteristics, including the route to resources, as well as specific spatial location with respect to local landmarks. In addition, V. germanica wasps have been shown to have sensorimotor learning capacities which allow them to associate visual stimuli with certain motor responses. This reported high cognitive plasticity enables V. germanica wasps to inhabit a variety of regions. Its flexibility in nesting and diet habits in conjunction with its foraging capabilities may help explain the success with which V. germanica has invaded so many different ecological areas. Kin selection Vespula germanica nest (illustration by Des Helmore) =Genetic relatedness within colonies= V. germanica queens are typically polyandrous. Because the queen mates with multiple males, the workers are more closely related to the queen's sons than to sons of other workers. These asymmetries in relatedness are believed to be a factor leading to worker policing within colonies. =Male skew= Male reproductive skew within V. germanica indicates that males do not contribute equally to the production of offspring when compared to females. The level of skew observed was higher among males in nests with queens that mated with multiple males. Reproductive skew may be linked to patterns of sex allocation, but sex ratio data for Vespula colonies suggest that a split-sex ratio is not produced. This contradicts the theory that the reproductive skew seen in V. germanica is part of an evolutionary strategy of males due to asymmetries in relatedness. =Worker policing= Workers at the nest entrance Worker policing is selected for when it benefits the colony. The benefits are gained through various measures, such as increasing colony efficiency and establishing a female-based sex-allocation ratio. Worker policing is especially common in colonies where queens mate with multiple males. Thus on average, the workers are more closely related to sons of the queen than to those of other workers. In the past, V. germanica was thought to be an exception to the general pattern that high mating frequency led to low levels of worker reproduction. However, recent studies indicate that while worker reproduction occurs at a considerable rate, worker policing keeps these worker-laid eggs from reaching adulthood. This is demonstrated by a study carried out in Belgium, showing that while an estimated 58.4 percent of male eggs were laid by workers, only 0.44 percent of adult males were workers' sons. The numbers indicate the efficiency with which worker policing is carried out. Policing by aggression, which prevents workers from laying eggs in the first place, leads to increases in colony productivity, while policing by eating the eggs of workers is more likely to result in sex-ratio benefits. Diet V. germanica on Dornfelder grapes Two V. germanica eating jam from a spoon V. germanica wasps have a diverse diet. They are known to eat carrion, live arthropods, fruit, honeydew, and processed human food and garbage. They are opportunistic scavengers and hunters able to obtain food from a variety of different sources. For example, many Vespula species have been observed feeding on dead honey bees (Apis mellifera) found outside the beehive entrance in the late summer. This flexibility in diet is beneficial, as V. germanica must often compete for resources with native biota in areas it invades. Parasites Female bee moths (Aphomia sociella) have been known to lay eggs in the nests of V. germanica. Hatched larvae will then feed on the eggs, larvae, and pupae left unprotected by the wasp, sometimes destroying large parts of the nest as they tunnel throughout looking for food. Pest status Adult foraging on flowers The species is considered a pest in most areas outside its native range, although its long residency in North America means it is not treated with any level of urgency there, unlike in areas such as South America, where the introduction is more recent and the impacts more dramatic.percent20et percent20al percent202001.pdf Successful Removal of German Yellow Jackets by Toxic Baiting.

Retrieved 7 January 2007 Wasp numbers reach their greatest densities in beech forest of the South Island, due to the abundant honeydew produced by the beech-scale insect there. It has a serious effect on forest ecology, as less honeydew remains available for native birds. However, German wasps were quickly succeeded in much of the South Island and its beech forests by the common wasp introduced in the 1970s.

The vast property is located between the cities of Woodland, Davis, and West Sacramento in a triangle formed by State Route 113, Interstate 5, and Interstate 80.  Background  Conaway Ranch is a property that sits to the east of both Davis and Woodland and west of Sacramento. Two-thirds of the property sits in the Yolo Bypass (the 'causeway'), the sink of Cache Creek, or the Green Zone between County Road 27 and County Road 29. Most of the ranch is currently protected by Williamson Act contracts. All of the land is zoned for agriculture or agriculture preserve and is leased to more than 40 farmers and various waterfowl and hunting groups. Also, there are three different 500 acre (2 km¬≤) wetlands on the ranch. Prior to 2001 the property was owned by a subsidiary of PG&E;, called PG&E; Properties. When PG&E; Properties went bankrupt, it was acquired by National Energy and Gas Transmission, NEGT. In 2004, the Yolo County Board of Supervisors announced plans to acquire Conaway Ranch from NEGT, which itself was now bankrupt. By order of the bankruptcy court, the property had to be sold in a closed-bid auction. By state law, Yolo County could not participate in that auction. The land was purchased in that auction for about $60 million by the Conaway Preservation Group. The Conaway Preservation Group is owned by a group of local businessmen, including Kyriakos Tsakopoulos who was named President & CEO of AKT Development Group. The land was the subject of an eminent domain action initiated by Yolo County. The ranch holds valuable water rights, among other natural resources. The county claimed that it had an interest in the land not being developed. Yolo County officials were attempting to seize the land for what they described as the public purpose of maintaining the status quo. The county claimed that it proposed transferring long-term management authority for the ranch to a Joint Powers Authority or similar consortium of entities such as Yolo County, municipalities within the county, the Yolo County Flood Control District, University of California at Davis, and possibly the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians. The Conaway Preservation Group opposed the action, arguing that the county did not need to condemn the ranch to fully protect the ranch's resources, which were already protected through local zoning, existing state law and local ordinances. The Conaway Preservation Group claimed it had no plans for development on the property, and made no requests to the county for any of the land to be rezoned. \\"The primary goal of the Conaway Preservation Group is to maintain private ownership while allowing for easements and other mechanisms to be placed on the ranch to protect the property's water resources, agricultural land, wildlife, and flood control benefits,\\" asserted former president Steve Giardo. The county planned to borrow all of the money for the acquisition from the Rumsey tribe. A price had not yet been determined, nor was any rate of interest publicly disclosed. The county contended that it estimated the price (which would be set by a jury) at $60 million. In September 2006 the county entered into a settlement agreement with the Conaway Preservation Group and abandoned the eminent domain action.

The group, which includes Anthony Smernes and current owner Steve Gidaro, proposed a housing and commercial development on the property‚Äôs northwest corner, next to the City of Woodland. The city government ultimately denied the plan, deciding to grow in a different direction 1991‚Äì1992: Conaway Conservancy Group sells $6.5 million worth of water to state Drought Water Bank. Yolo County Board of Supervisors, including current Supervisor Helen Thomson, vote to support water transfer on a 4-1 vote. December 1994: PG&E; buys interests of local landowners, including ownership share held by Steve Gidaro, John Reynen, and Anthony Smernes. Both Steve and John plan to re-purchase the property at some point in the future. 1996: PG&E; drops development plans, places Conaway Ranch on the market for $68.5 million. Gidaro and Reynen consider re-purchasing the property. Local elected officials discuss forming a Joint Powers Authority to secure funding to purchase Conaway. PG&E; Properties pulls property off the market. 2001: Property is transferred from PG&E; to National Energy and Gas Transmission (NEGT) as part of PG&E; restructuring during bankruptcy proceedings. March 2004: NEGT announces it will sell the property. Sets up closed bidding process to sell ranch. Steve and John request bid package and begin process of putting investment group together. Local elected officials form Joint Powers Authority in an attempt to secure financing to bid for the Ranch. May 2004: Yolo County supervisors decide to not participate in closed bidding process and, instead, start eminent domain proceedings to acquire property. July 8, 2004: Yolo County supervisors vote 4-0 to adopt eminent domain resolution to acquire property. December 15, 2004: After NEGT‚Äôs bid process closes, Conaway Preservation Group, LLC, awarded ownership of Conaway Ranch. Ownership includes Steve Gidaro, John Reynen and other prominent investors/developers in Sacramento. CPG conducts outreach to County supervisors to reach compromise that would keep property in private ownership but place greater public controls on land and water. February 2005: CPG offers to conduct tours of property with County supervisors. Yolo County suspends public Joint Powers Authority meetings. May 2005: Yolo County officials announce ‚Äòstringless deal‚Äô agreement with Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians who agree to provide financing for condemnation action. November 30, 2005: Yolo County Superior Court Judge Timothy Fall rules that the county can use its power of eminent domain to take the ranch, despite CPG‚Äôs argument that the county did not adequately specify what it intended to do with the property. September 7, 2006: Yolo County and Conaway Preservation Group agree to a settlement and the eminent domain action is dropped. December 2010: Developer Angelo K. Tsakopoulos assumes controlling interest in Conaway Ranch through a purchase under his Tri-City Water and Farm LLC Conaway's Future June 13, 2006: A Yolo County Superior Court jury is scheduled to begin hearing evidence of how much the county will have to pay for the property. Estimates range from $50 million to more than $389 million.

It is a sequel to Cannery Row and set in the years after the end of World War II. According to the author, \\"Sweet Thursday\\" is the day between Lousy Wednesday and Waiting Friday.  Plot summary  Doc returns to a failed Western Biological Laboratories and a changed Cannery Row after serving in the army during World War II. Mack and the Boys are still living in the Palace Flophouse, but Lee Chong has sold his general store to Joseph and Mary Rivas. Since the death of its original owner Dora, the local brothel, The Bear Flag Restaurant, is now being run by Dora's older sister Fauna, a former mission worker previously known as Flora. Under Fauna, the girls of the Bear Flag study etiquette and posture with the goal of joining Fauna's list of \\"gold stars,\\" former employees of the Bear Flag who have married and left their employ there. As Doc tries to rebuild his neglected business, the latest Bear Flag resident Suzy is causing trouble. Fauna knows Suzy isn't cut out to be a working girl, but her soft heart always causes her to fall for a hard luck story. Deciding to make Suzy one of her gold star girls, Fauna plots to throw Suzy into the arms of an unwitting Doc and enlists the aid of Mack and the Boys. After a disastrous party hosted by Mack and the Boys, Suzy leaves the Bear Flag, but not to marry Doc. Choosing to live alone, Suzy moves into an empty boiler in a vacant lot and takes a job at the local diner, the Golden Poppy. While Cannery Row is stunned over Suzy's actions and Doc wrestles with a critical project, Hazel, one of the Boys living in the Palace Flophouse, struggles with his own demons. Having been told by Fauna in an astrological reading he will become President of the United States, Hazel fights destiny. To practice for high office, Hazel understands that he must learn to make difficult decisions ‚Äî one of which is breaking Doc's arm, for he‚Äôs realized that this, arousing Suzy's sympathy, is the only way to bring the couple together.

Fielding's Dissertation What do HTTP URIs Identify?, by Tim Berners-Lee Resources are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers.RFC 1738 Uniform Resource Locators (URL) In the Semantic Web, web resources and their semantic properties are described using the Resource Description Framework.RDF Current Status History The concept of a web resource has evolved during the Web's history, from the early notion of static addressable documents or files, to a more generic and abstract definition, now encompassing every \\"thing\\" or entity that can be identified, named, addressed or handled, in any way whatsoever, in the web at large, or in any networked information system. The declarative aspects of a resource (identification and naming) and its functional aspects (addressing and technical handling) were not clearly distinct in the early specifications of the web, and the very definition of the concept has been the subject of long and still open debate involving difficult, and often arcane, technical, social, linguistic and philosophical issues. =From documents and files to web resources= In the early specifications of the web (1990‚Äì1994), the term resource is barely used at all. The web is designed as a network of more or less static addressable objects, basically files and documents, linked using uniform resource locators (URLs). A web resource is implicitly defined as something which can be identified. The identification serves two distinct purposes: naming and addressing; the latter only depends on a protocol. It is notable that RFC 1630 does not attempt to define at all the notion of resource; actually it barely uses the term besides its occurrence in URI, URL and URN, and still speaks about \\"Objects of the Network\\". RFC 1738 (December 1994) further specifies URLs, the term \\"Universal\\" being changed to \\"Uniform\\". The document is making a more systematic use of resource to refer to objects which are \\"available\\", or \\"can be located and accessed\\" through the internet. There again, the term resource itself is not explicitly defined. =From web resources to abstract resources= The first explicit definition of resource is found in RFC 2396, in August 1998: Although examples in this document were still limited to physical entities, the definition opened the door to more abstract resources. Providing a concept is given an identity, and this identity is expressed by a well-formed URI (uniform resource identifier, a superset of URLs), then a concept can be a resource as well. In January 2005, RFC 3986 makes this extension of the definition completely explicit: '‚Ä¶abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship (e.g., \\"parent\\" or \\"employee\\"), or numeric values (e.g., zero, one, and infinity).' Resources in RDF and the Semantic Web First released in 1999, RDF was first intended to describe resources, in other words to declare metadata of resources in a standard way. A RDF description of a resource is a set of triples (subject, predicate, object), where subject represents the resource to be described, predicate a type of property relevant to this resource, and object can be data or another resource. The predicate itself is considered as a resource and identified by a URI. Hence, properties like \\"title\\", \\"author\\" are represented in RDF as resources, which can be used, in a recursive way, as the subject of other triples. Building on this recursive principle, RDF vocabularies, such as RDFS, OWL, and SKOS will pile up definitions of abstract resources such as classes, properties, concepts, all identified by URIs. RDF also specifies the definition of anonymous resources or blank nodes, which are not absolutely identified by URIs. =Using HTTP URIs to identify abstract resources= URLs, particularly HTTP URIs, are frequently used to identify abstract resources, such as classes, properties or other kind of concepts. Examples can be found in RDFS or OWL ontologies. Since such URIs are associated with the HTTP protocol, the question arose of which kind of representation, if any, should one get for such resources through this protocol, typically using a web browser, and if the syntax of the URI itself could help to differentiate \\"abstract\\" resources from \\"information\\" resources. The URI specifications such as RFC 3986 left to the protocol specification the task of defining actions performed on the resources and they don't provide any answer to this question. It had been suggested that an HTTP URI identifying a resource in the original sense, such as a file, document, or any kind of so-called information resource, should be \\"slash\\" URIs ‚Äî in other words, should not contain a fragment identifier, whereas a URI used to identify a concept or abstract resource should be a \\"hash\\" URI using a fragment identifier. For example: \`http://www.example.org/catalogue/widgets.html\` would both identify and locate a web page (maybe providing some human-readable description of the widgets sold by Silly Widgets, Inc.) whereas \`http://www.example.org/ontology#Widget\` would identify the abstract concept or class \\"Widget\\" in this company ontology, and would not necessarily retrieve any physical resource through HTTP protocol. But it has been answered that such a distinction is impossible to enforce in practice, and famous standard vocabularies provide counter- examples widely used. For example, the Dublin Core concepts such as \\"title\\", \\"publisher\\", \\"creator\\" are identified by \\"slash\\" URIs like \`http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title\`. The general question of which kind of resources HTTP URI should or should not identify has been formerly known in W3C as the httpRange-14 issue, following its name on the list defined by the (TAG). The TAG delivered in 2005 a final answer to this issue, making the distinction between an \\"information resource\\" and a \\"non-information\\" resource dependent on the type of answer given by the server to a \\"GET\\" request: * 2xx Success indicates resource is an information resource. * 303 See Other indicates the resource could be informational or abstract; the redirection target could tell you. * 4xx Client Error provides no information at all. This allows vocabularies (like Dublin Core, FOAF, and Wordnet) to continue to use slash instead of hash for pragmatic reasons. While this compromise seems to have met a consensus in the Semantic Web community, some of its prominent members such as Pat Hayes have expressed concerns both on its technical feasibility and conceptual foundation. According to Patrick Hayes' viewpoint, the very distinction between \\"information resource\\" and \\"other resource\\" is impossible to find and should better not be specified at all, and ambiguity of the referent resource is inherent to URIs like to any naming mechanism. =Resource ownership, intellectual property and trust= In RDF, \\"anybody can declare anything about anything\\". Resources are defined by formal descriptions which anyone can publish, copy, modify and publish over the web. If the content of a web resource in the classical sense (a web page or on-line file) is clearly owned by its publisher, who can claim intellectual property on it, an abstract resource can be defined by an accumulation of RDF descriptions, not necessarily controlled by a unique publisher, and not necessarily consistent with each other. It's an open issue to know if a resource should have an authoritative definition with clear and trustable ownership, and in this case, how to make this description technically distinct from other descriptions. A parallel issue is how intellectual property may apply to such descriptions.

Cunningham; findagrave.com Retrieved June 18, 2017 was an American aviator and a United States Marine Corps officer who became the first Marine Corps aviator and the first director of Marine Corps Aviation. His military career included service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I, and U.S. operations in the Caribbean during the 1920s. Early life and career Cunningham was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His interest in aviation began in 1903 when he watched a balloon ascend one afternoon. The next time the balloon went up he was in it and from then on he was considered himself a \\"confirmed aeronautical enthusiast\\". He enlisted in the 3rd Georgia Volunteer Infantry regiment during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and served a tour of occupation duty in Cuba. He spent the next decade selling real estate in Atlanta. During this time evinced an interest in aeronautics, making a balloon ascent in 1903. At the age of twenty-seven, he returned to the military life, mostly because he thought that he would be given the opportunity to fly. He was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on 25 January 1909. Supporter of Marine Corps aviation As a lieutenant, Alfred Cunningham retained an interest in aeronautics, he found at Philadelphia a likewise avid group of civilians and off-duty military men who harbored an interest in the same thing. He rented an airplane and gained permission from the commandant of the Navy Yard to use an open field at the Philadelphia Navy Yard for test flights. He also joined the Aero Club of Philadelphia, and commenced \\"selling\\" Marine Corps aviation to members of the Aero Club, who, through their Washington connections, began to pressure a number of officials, including Major General Commandant William P. Biddle, himself a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Cunningham was an avid supporter in the new conceptual Advanced Base Force and thought he saw a role for aircraft, requesting assignment to the Navy's flying school at Annapolis. Cunningham served in the Marine guards of New Jersey (BB-16) and North Dakota (BB-29), and the receiving ship , over the next two years. 1stLt Alfred A. Cunningham, first Marine Corps aviator August 1912 FAI Hydraeroplane Certificate # 2, 11 June 1913 for Alfred A. Cunningham In 1911, while he was stationed at the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia Navy Yard, he developed the inspiration to fly. Leasing a plane from a civilian aviator only $25 a month, he experimented in the airplane, nicknamed the \\"Noisy Nan\\". He was promoted to the rank and grade of 1st lieutenant in September 1911. Although the plane never left the ground, his profound faith and love of flying was rewarded. On 16 May 1912, Cunningham received orders and stood detached from duty at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, and was ordered to the aviation camp the Navy had set up at United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, to learn to fly. He reported six days later, on 22 May 1912, which is recognized as the birthday of Marine Corps aviation. Actual flight training was given at the Burgess Plant at Marblehead, Massachusetts, because only the builders of planes could fly in those days and after two hours and forty minutes of instruction, Cunningham soloed on 20 August 1912. He flew the Curtiss seaplane and became Naval Aviator No. 5, and Smith became Naval Aviator No. 6. File ZGU, Subject File, 1911‚Äì1927, RG 45. Between October 1912 and July 1913, Cunningham made some 400 flights in the Curtiss B-1, conducting training and testing tactics and aircraft capabilities. In August 1913, Cunningham sought detachment from aviation duty, on the grounds that his fianc√©e would not marry him unless he gave up flying. Although assigned duty as assistant quartermaster at the Marine barracks at the Washington Navy Yard, the first Marine aviator continued to advocate Marine Corps aviation and contribute significantly to its growth. By November 1913, the Navy Department had assigned Cunningham (and Smith) to return to the Advanced Base School with the understanding that they would create an aviation section for the force. Cunningham performed important reconnaissance roles for the force, which was fully functionable by 1914. Later, he served on a board, headed by Captain Washington I. Chambers, USN, tasked with drawing up a comprehensive plan for the organization of a naval aeronautical service. It was upon the recommendation of that board that the Naval Aeronautical Station at Pensacola, Florida, was established in 1914. The following February, Cunningham was assigned duty at the Washington Navy Yard, assisting Naval Constructor Holden C. Richardson in working on the D-2 flying boat. Ordered to Pensacola for instruction in April 1915 (his wife apparently having relented in allowing her husband to fly), Cunningham was designated Naval Aviator No. 5 on 17 September 1915. World War I service After heading the motor erecting shop at Pensacola, he underwent instruction at the Army Signal Corps Aviation School at San Diego, whence he was assigned to the Commission on Navy Yards and Naval Stations. Cunningham received orders on 26 February 1917, to organize the Aviation Company for the Advanced Base Force, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Designated as the commander of this unit, Cunningham soon emerged as de facto director of Marine Corps aviation. He sought, and got, enthusiastic volunteers to become pilots, and soon embarked on a determined campaign to define a mission for land-based marine air. In addition, he served on a joint Army-Navy board that selected sites for naval air stations in seven naval districts and on the east and gulf coasts. Detailed to Europe to obtain information on British and French aviation practices, he participated in a variety of missions over German lines. Returning to the United States in January 1918, he presented a plan to use Marine aircraft to operate against submarines off the Belgian coast and against submarine bases at Zeebrugge, Ostend, and Bruges. The Northern Bombing Group emerged from these plans‚Äîfour landplane squadrons equipped and trained in five months' time. On 12 July 1918, 72 planes, 176 officers and 1,030 enlisted men sailed for France on board the transport DeKalb, arriving at Brest on 30 July 1918. The Marines were sent to the fields at Oye, Le Fresne, and St. Pol, France; and at Hoondschoote, Ghietelles, Varsennaire and Knesselaere, Belgium. Despite shortages of planes, spare parts, and tools, the Marines participated in 43 raids with British and French units, as well as 14 independent raids, and shot down eight enemy aircraft. Planes of the group also dropped 52,000 pounds of bombs, and supplied 2,650 pounds of food in five food-dropping missions to encircled French troops. For his service in organizing and training the first Marine aviation force, Cunningham was awarded the Navy Cross. =Navy Cross citation= Citation: > The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting > the Navy Cross to Major Alfred Austell Cunningham (MCSN: 0-211), United > States Marine Corps, for distinguished service in the line of his profession > in connection with the organization and training of the First Marine > Aviation Force in the United States, and as Commanding Officer of this > Aviation force in France, where it served against the enemy and rendered > valuable service as part of the Northern Bombing Group (USN). Post-war activities After World War I, Cunningham returned to the United States to become officer-in-charge of Marine Corps aviation, a billet in which he remained until 26 December 1920, when he was detailed to command the First Air Squadron in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Ordered thence to general duty at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Major Cunningham then served as assistant adjutant and inspector, and then division Marine officer and aide on the staff of commander, Battleship Division 3. On temporary detached duty in Nicaragua from June 1928, he served with the 2nd Brigade of Marines as executive officer of the Western Area at Leon, Nicaragua. Retirement and last years Subsequently, becoming executive officer and registrar of the Marine Corps Institute from 1929 to 1931, Cunningham finished up his career as assistant quartermaster at the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia. His health failing, Cunningham retired on 1 August 1935. Promoted to lieutenant colonel while on the retired list, he died at Sarasota, Florida, on 27 May 1939. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Honors U.S.S. Alfred A. Cunningham (DD-752) Plaque of Cunningham at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame The destroyer USS Alfred A. Cunningham (DD-752) was named in his honor, it was commissioned in 1944, decommissioned in 1971, and deliberately sunk in 1979. In 1965, Cunningham was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1991 he was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame.

Members of the Lakota, a part of them \\"Ankpapat\\", were the first Native Americans to fight in the American Indian Wars alongside US forces west of the Missouri.Robinson, Doane: Official Correspondence Pertaining to the Leavenworth Expedition into South Dakota in 1823 for the Conquest of the Ree Indians.

They may have formed as a tribe within the Lakota relatively recently, as the first mention of the Hunkpapa in European-American historical records was from a treaty of 1825. By signing the 1825 treaty, the Hunkpapa and the United States committed themselves to keep up the \\"friendship which has heretofore existed\\". With their x-mark, the chiefs also recognized the supremacy of the United States.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904, Vol.2, p.235. It is not certain whether they really understood the text in the document. The US representatives gave a medal to Little White Bear, who they understood was the principal Hunkpapa chief; they did not realize how decentralized Native American authority was.Jensen, Richard E. & James S. Hutchins: Wheel Boats on the Missouri. The Journals and Documents of the Atkinson-O'Fallon Expedition, 1824-26. Helena and Lincoln, 2001, p.128. With the Vaccination Act of 1832, the United States assumed responsibility for the inoculation of the Indians against smallpox. Some visiting Hunkpapa may have benefitted from Dr. M. Martin's vaccination of about 900 southern Lakota (no divisions named) at the head of Medicine Creek that autumn.Trimble, Michael K.: \\"The 1832 Inoculation Program on the Missouri River\\". In Verano, John W. and D.H. Ubelaker (eds): Disease and Demography in the Americas. Washington and London, 1992, pp. 257-264. When smallpox struck in 1837, it hit the Hunkpapa as the northernmost Lakota division. The loss, however, may have been fewer than one hundred people.Bray, Kingsley M.: \\"Teton Sioux Population History, 1655-1881\\". Nebraska History, Summer 1994, Vol. 75, No. 2, p. 178, column II. Overall, the Hunkpapa seem to have suffered less from new diseases than many other tribes did.Bray (1994), \\"Teton Sioux Population History, 1655-1881\\", p.184, column II. The boundaries for the Lakota Indian territory were defined in the general peace treaty negotiated near Fort Laramie in the summer of 1851. Leaders of eight different tribes, often at odds with each other and each claiming large territories, signed the treaty. The United States was a ninth party to it. The Crow Indian territory included a tract of land north of the Yellowstone, while the Little Bighorn River ran through the heartland of the Crow country (now Montana). The treaty defines the land of the Arikara, the Hidatsa and the Mandan as a mutual area north of Heart River, partly encircled by the Missouri (now North Dakota).Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, p. 594. http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/sio0594.htm Soon enough the Hunkpapa and other Sioux attacked the Arikara and the two other so- called village tribes, just as they had done in the past. By 1854, these three smallpox-devastated tribes called for protection from the U.S. Army, and they would repeatedly do so almost to the end of inter-tribal warfare.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 106. Eventually the Hunkpapa and other Lakota took control of the three tribes' area north of Heart River, forcing the village people to live in Like a Fishhook Village outside their treaty land. The Lakota were largely in control of the occupied area to 1876-1877.Meyer (1977), The Village Indians, pp. 110-133. The United States Army General Warren estimated the population of the Hunkpapa Lakota at about 2920 in 1855. He described their territory as ranging \\"from the Big Cheyenne up to the Yellowstone, and west to the Black Hills. He states that they formerly intermarried extensively with the Cheyenne.\\" He noted that they raided settlers along the Platte River. In addition to dealing with warfare, they suffered considerable losses due to contact with Europeans and contracting of Eurasian infectious diseases to which they had no immunity. The Hunkpapa gave some of their remote relatives among the Santee Sioux armed support during a large-scale battle near Killdeer Mountain in 1864 with U.S. troops led by General A. Sully.Larson, Robert W.: \\"Galls Last Stand\\", The Quarterly Journal of Military History, Autumn 2009, 22, 2, p. 46. Scott, Kim Allen and Ken Kempcke: \\"A Journey to the Heart of Darkness. John W. Wright and the War against the Sioux, 1863-1865\\", Montana, The Magazine of the West, Vol. 50, No. 4 (Winter 2000), pp.2-17. The Great Sioux Reservation was established with a new treaty in 1868.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, pp. 998-1003. The Lakota agreed to the construction of \\"any railroad\\" outside their reservation. The United States recognized that \\"the country north of the North Platte River and east of the summits of the Big Horn Mountains\\" was unsold or unceded Indian territory.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, p. 1002. These hunting grounds in the south and in the west of the new Lakota domain were used mainly by the Sicangu (Brule-Sioux) and the Oglala, living nearby. The \\"free bands\\" of Hunkpapa favored campsites outside the unsold areas. They took a leading part in the westward enlargement of the range used by the Lakota in the late 1860s and the early 1870s at the expense of other tribes. In search for buffalo, Lakota regularly occupied the eastern part of the Crow Indian Reservation as far west as the Bighorn River, sometimes even raiding the Crow Agency, as they did in 1873.Linderman, Frank B.: Plenty Coups.

That was in 1873, notably one year before the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, but the US government did not take action on this concept until three years later. The Hunkpapa were among the victors in the Battle of Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian Reservation in July 1876.Hoxie, Frederick E.: Parading Through History.

Lincoln and London, 1982, p. 113. Since the 1880s, most Hunkpapa have lived in the Standing Rock Indian Reservation (in North and South Dakota). It comprises land along the Grand River which had been used by the Arikara Indians in 1823; the Hunkpapa \\"won the west\\" half a century before the whites.White, Richard: \\"The Winning of the West: The Expansion of the Western Sioux in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\\". The Journal of American History, Vol. 65, No. 2 (Sep. 1978), pp. 319-343. During the 1870s, when the Native Americans of the Great Plains were fighting the United States, the Hunkpapa were led by Sitting Bull in the fighting, together with the Oglala Lakota. They were among the last of the tribes to go to the reservations. By 1891, the majority of Hunkpapa Lakota, about 571 people, resided in the Standing Rock Indian Reservation of North and South Dakota. Since then they have not been counted separately from the rest of the Lakota.  Population in the 19th century  The Hunkpapa population was estimated to be around 1,600 men, women and children in 1805, corresponding to 160 tipis. Shihasapa and Sans Arc migration to Hunkpapa camps in the 1840s had doubled their number of tipis in 1849. From a height in 1855 with 360 lodges, the next decades were marked by a small decline. The decline was higher in percentage of the total Lakota population. In 1855, the total number of lodges were nearly 2,000. Fifteen years later only 315 tipis out of 2,400 were set up in Hunkpapa camps.Bray, Kingsley M.: Teton Sioux Population History, 1655-1881. Nebraska History, Summer 1994, Vol. 75, No. 2, pp. 165-188.

Overview Split across two 12\\" EPs, the second released eight weeks after the first and each limited to 1000 pressings, the records marked a significant change in sound from previous AFX and Aphex Twin releases. Moving away from the analogue sounds of the previous releases, Donkey Rhubarb and ...I Care Because You Do, the tracks show James experimenting with computer-arranged Breakbeat programming and timestretched samples, and thus can be seen as a precursor to Richard D.

The records are influenced by the early EPs of fellow Cornish producer Plug (Luke Vibert), as well as other drum and bass movements of the day. The CD compilation cover is by The Designers Republic.

Cunningham (DD-752), an , is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Alfred Austell Cunningham, a USMC officer and aviator. Alfred A. Cunningham (DD-752) was laid down on 23 February 1944 at Staten Island, New York, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 3 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Alfred A. Cunningham, the widow of Lieutenant Colonel Cunningham; and commissioned on 23 November 1944, Commander Floyd B. T. Myhre in command. Service history =World War II= Following shakedown training out of Bermuda, Alfred A. Cunningham returned to New York on 17 January 1945 for post-shakedown availability. Proceeding to Norfolk soon thereafter, the destroyer spent the next three months operating in the Chesapeake Bay area as a training ship for prospective destroyer crews. Here the ship introduced hundreds of trainees to life on board a destroyer, engaging in gunnery exercises, damage control drills, and maneuvering practice. Following a brief availability for repairs and alterations at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Cunningham got underway on 7 May, and rendezvoused with the new heavy cruiser off Brown Shoals, Delaware Bay, and proceeded with that ship to Chesapeake Bay for gunnery exercises. The two warships then steamed to Guantanamo Bay, then Panama, transiting the canal on 18 May, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 May. Over the next two weeks, Cunningham remained in Hawaiian waters, undergoing an availability alongside the and carrying out training. On 13 June, the destroyer joined Task Group (TG) 12.4 and sailed for the western Pacific. A week later, while en route, Cunningham screened carriers launching air strikes on Japanese-held Wake Island. The group arrived at Leyte on 26 June. Cunningham got underway the following day for Okinawa, and while en route to her destination conducted a depth charge attack on what she evaluated as a \\"good\\" submarine contact, but with negative results. Shortly after arriving at Okinawa on 29 June, she served on radar picket duty off the island's southwest coast. From 1 July until the end of hostilities she served on patrol, escort, and screening duty in waters surrounding the Ryukyus. Following Japan's capitulation, Cunningham remained in the Far East, operating off the coast of China between the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea. She performed escort services and served on an antismuggling patrol between Korea and Japan. The destroyer returned to the United States on 28 March 1946, went into reserve at San Diego on 12 May 1947, and was decommissioned in August 1949. =Korea= During the buildup of the fleet in the wake of the North Korean invasion of South Korea in late June 1950, Alfred A. Cunningham was recommissioned on 5 October 1950, Commander L. P. Spear in command, and joined the Pacific Fleet. Following training exercises, the destroyer got underway for the western Pacific (WestPac) on 2 January 1951. Cunningham was involved in a variety of operations, principally serving with Task Force (TF) 77, the fast carrier task force, off the coast of Korea. Early in this deployment, on 18 February 1951, the ship was released from her \\"Bird Dog\\" station (plane guard) with TF 77 to carry out a night shore bombardment mission on \\"targets of opportunity\\" near Tanchon, on the east coast of Korea. Cunningham arrived on station at 2130 and opened fire, conducting harassing and interdictory fire; her targets included railroad tracks, two grade crossings, a tunnel, and lights on the road leading south. After expending 90 rounds of 5-inch, the destroyer ceased fire at 0605 on the 19th. Returning to San Diego on 4 September 1951, Cunningham again sailed for the Far East in March 1952. As before, she steamed with the fast carrier task force off Korea and performed shore bombardment missions. On 19 September, the destroyer was operating in Task Element 95.22 (the \\"Songjin Element\\") to prevent the movement of trains along the railroad at that point by preventing clearance of the roadbed and repair during the day, and destroying trains at night. Patrolling some 6,000 yards off the beach at about 1340, Cunningham fired on enemy workers she had seen in the vicinity. A little over an hour later, detecting the workers at a tunnel, the destroyer stood in toward the shoreline, turning slowly to starboard to take a northeasterly course to fire on the enemy at the tunnel mouth. At that point, at least three enemy guns opened fire on the ship. The first salvo was a direct hit, on the main deck, starboard side; several pieces of shrapnel penetrated the shield of mount 51 and wounded three of the mount's crew. Two air bursts followed in quick succession, one on either side of the bridge. Within two minutes time, the North Korean guns had registered four more direct hits and at least seven air bursts near the ship. One shell penetrated into the forward fire room, destroying a forced-draft blower; shrapnel holed a nearby bulkhead. Another shell struck a depth charge on the forward K-gun, blowing the charge apart and scattering burning TNT as far aft as the fantail; shrapnel from this hit set another depth charge afire, and ruptured four others. The fourth hit on the starboard side, two feet below the main deck; shrapnel from this hit caused extensive damage to the motor whaleboat. The last shell to hit struck about two feet below the waterline, but did not penetrate. The air bursts near the bridge rendered the SG radar inoperative. Immediately, one of the ship's 3-inch mounts opened up to return the shore battery's fire, expending both hoppers full (ten rounds); these rounds landed in the target area but did not slow the enemy's rate of fire. With Cunningham under fire, Lieutenant Frederick F. Palmer, USNR, the officer of the deck, sounded the general alarm, ordered the rudder shifted to left full, rang up the port engine back emergency full, starboard engine ahead flank, in order to come left and open the range. Although mount 53 had reported a fire on the starboard K-guns, the blast from the guns of that mount and the nearby 3-inch mount, 34, prevented a repair party from approaching the blaze from that angle. Men from another damage control party got to the fire and battled the blaze, while as the ship sped to seaward, weaving but keeping at least one main battery mount bearing on the target guns at all times. As the ship opened the range to 9,000 yards and worked up to 26.5 knots, Ensign Charles E. Dennis, USNR; Chief Torpedoman William J. Bohrman; and Electrician's Mate 2nd Class Victor J. Leonard manhandled one burning depth charge over the side, performing this task at great personal risk while the fire on the K-guns was being brought under control. All three men were later recommended for the award of the Bronze Star. Having suffered 13 men wounded, principally to shrapnel, Cunningham pulled out of range and stood down from general quarters, steering toward Yang Do Island to receive medical assistance from . After emergency repairs, Cunningham was able to continue her combat operations. Cunningham ultimately returned to the United States and reached her new home port, Long Beach, California, on 6 November. Cunningham operated in the southern California area through the first five months of 1953 before getting underway on 13 June for another WestPac deployment. During her five months in the Far East, Cunningham operated twice with TF 77. The first of these periods saw her escorting the heavy cruiser . On 29 and 30 July 1953, Cunningham participated, with Bremerton and other United States Navy ships, in the search and rescue effort to recover the crew of a Boeing RB-50 that had crashed in the Sea of Japan. The searching ships managed to recover only the co-pilot. The destroyer also participated in intensive antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises with TG 96.7 and joined in operations near Taiwan with other ships of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 131. She returned to Long Beach on 20 December 1953. A regular overhaul kept her at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard from February through April 1954. Then, after two months of training, Cunningham got underway for WestPac on 10 August. En route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor for gunnery and antisubmarine exercises and then continued on to Yokosuka, Japan. Cunningham joined TG 70.2 for maneuvers and division exercises and made two brief port visits to Manila. Next she operated with TF 72 as a part of a patrol in the Taiwan Strait. Cunningham then escorted to Hong Kong and on to Manila, where she spent the holiday season. Cunningham continued her work as plane guard for Yorktown into 1955, and returned to Long Beach on 6 February. After a leave and upkeep period, she resumed operations off the California coast. On 11 May, the destroyer took part in Operation \\"WigWam.\\" Following five months of preparation, Cunningham departed the west coast on 11 October, bound for Japan. She made fuel stops at Pearl Harbor and Midway en route to Yokosuka. Upon completion of voyage repairs, the destroyer joined TF 77 for three weeks of duty, broken once by a port call at Kobe, Japan. Cunningham spent the Christmas holidays at Yokosuka. =1956‚Äì1965= Antisubmarine exercises were her first assignment of 1956 before she proceeded, via Subic Bay, to join the Taiwan Strait patrol for a fortnight. Then the destroyer visited Hong Kong and stopped briefly in Yokosuka for repairs before sailing for home. After arriving at Long Beach on 31 March, she entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in May for an overhaul which was followed by two months of underway training out of San Diego. On 6 November, Alfred A. Cunningham got underway to escort Bremerton to Melbourne, Australia, where the ships participated in festivities surrounding the XVI Olympic Games. After 10 days in that port, the destroyer sailed for Yokosuka. In January 1957, Cunningham took part in exercises near Chinhae, Korea, with ships of the Republic of Korea Navy (ROK). She then joined TF 77 in the South China Sea for plane-guard duty. This work was followed by another stint with the Taiwan Strait patrol. Cunningham made stops at Subic Bay, Hong Kong, and Yokosuka before sailing for the United States. She arrived at Long Beach on 12 May and devoted the next few months to air defense, hunter/killer operations, and shore bombardment exercises along the California coast. In December, the destroyer entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an availability. On 13 January 1958, Cunningham sailed for another Far East tour. Following stops at Pearl Harbor; Pago Pago, American Samoa; and Wellington, New Zealand, the destroyer arrived at Hobart, Tasmania, on 7 February. There, the members of her crew were graciously entertained by officials of the Royal Hobart Regatta. On 12 February, Cunningham got underway for Guam, where she received two weeks of repair work. The destroyer then shifted to Yokosuka, arriving on 1 April. During the following months, the ship took part in numerous exercises, escorting and screening and other warships. During the cruise, she visited Hong Kong; Subic Bay; and Buckner Bay, Okinawa, before arriving back at Long Beach on 21 July. In early September, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for overhaul. She left drydock in early December and spent the holidays in leave and upkeep. The destroyer held refresher training during the first three months of 1959, departed Long Beach on 28 March, and steamed to Yokosuka. On 15 April, she left that port in company with to take part in Exercise \\"Sea Turtle\\", off the coast of Korea. Late in May, Cunningham assisted in Exercise \\"Granite Creek.\\" After a visit to Hong Kong, she returned to Yokosuka for an availability to prepare for the voyage home where she arrived on 27 August. The ship spent the rest of the year participating in gunnery exercises, ASW exercises, and acting as a school ship for Fleet Training Group, Pacific. In January 1960, Cunningham, took part in STRIKEX 30-60. On 1 February, she became a unit of DesDiv 132 and was assigned to TG 14.7, a hunter/killer group. From 1 February to 7 May, the destroyer trained with that unit in the eastern Pacific. Leaving Long Beach on 17 May with Destroyer Squadron 13 and , Cunningham proceeded to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 23 May. The force remained in Hawaiian waters conducting ASW exercises until their departure on 5 July. The destroyer reached Kobe, Japan, on 16 July and began an upkeep period. She next sailed for ASW operations in the area off Okinawa, conducting these until 29 August, when the ship entered Subic Bay. Except for two brief visits to Hong Kong, she remained in the Subic Bay area until 3 December, when she sailed for Yokosuka. After a brief upkeep period, the ship left on a return voyage to the west coast, arriving at Long Beach on 18 December. In late January 1961, the ship entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul. She held sea trials in July and August and resumed operations on 22 September. On 9 October, she sailed for Seattle. The ship conducted sound trials in Puget Sound from 12 to 20 October and then returned to Long Beach, whence she held refresher training in San Diego waters with the fleet training group from 30 October through 8 December. Throughout the first five months of 1962, Cunningham alternated periods at sea with upkeep in her home port. On 7 June, she departed the west coast for a six- month WestPac cruise. Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 13 June, the destroyer conducted ASW operations off Oahu before proceeding on to Yokosuka. In August, the destroyer took part in combined operations with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and made port calls at Kure, Kobe, and Sasebo, before returning to Yokosuka on 31 October. She got underway again on 3 November for patrol duty in the Strait of Tsushima and, after completing this task on 14 November, sailed via Hong Kong to Subic Bay. On 2 December, the ship participated in a weapons demonstration, then began her voyage back to the United States, arriving at Long Beach on 21 December. The destroyer spent the first three months of 1963 in local operations, including its participation in the filming of the Warner Brothers family film The Incredible Mr. Limpet, starring Don Knotts and Carole Cook. On 1 April, she became a part of DesDiv 232 and spent April and May in availability at San Diego. Putting to sea in early June, she began a series of intensive ASW training exercises. In August, Cunningham sailed north with Carrier Division 19 on a goodwill and training cruise to Seattle, and the Alaskan ports of Skagway and Dutch Harbor. After a month back at Long Beach, the destroyer got underway for Pearl Harbor and several weeks of ASW operations. She returned to Long Beach in December for leave and upkeep. On 20 February 1964, the ship left Long Beach in company with the other ships of DesDiv 232 for a six-month WestPac tour. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 28 February, Cunningham operated locally until sailing for the Far East on 23 March. Soon after leaving Hawaii, the destroyer took part in Operation \\"Crazy Horse\\", off the coast of Okinawa. On 7 April, the ship began a week of upkeep in Yokosuka. Other ports of call during this deployment included Kure, Sasebo, and Hong Kong. From 9 June to 4 July, the ship operated out of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on the Taiwan Strait patrol. Alfred A. Cunningham. then steamed to the Sea of Japan for Operation \\"Crossed Tee\\", a joint operation with ships of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Then, following stops at Hakodate and Yokosuka, Japan, the destroyer arrived back in Long Beach on 11 August for leave, upkeep, and local operations. On 15 November, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. Upon completion of this renewal effort on 15 March 1965, the ship departed Long Beach for seven weeks of refresher training in San Diego waters. Early in June, she embarked 30 midshipmen for a two-week training cruise in the Puget Sound area. On 12 August, Cunningham got underway for her 13th WestPac cruise. The ship stopped at Pearl Harbor for a two-week ASW operation held southwest of Molokai. A fortnight's upkeep at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard ensued before the destroyer continued on to Yokosuka. =Vietnam= In October, Alfred A. Cunningham joined TF 77 for patrol and surveillance duties off the coast of North Vietnam and in the Gulf of Tonkin. Following a week of recreation in Hong Kong, the destroyer got underway on 10 November to steam to Kaohsiung, and operated out of that port on patrol in the Taiwan Strait. On 5 December, she proceeded through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan for a joint ASW exercise with ships of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Navy before returning to Sasebo for the Christmas holidays. In January 1966, Cunningham again patrolled off the Vietnamese coast and provided naval gunfire support in the area of Quang Ngai, South Vietnam. The final weeks of her patrol were spent on radar picket station south of Hainan Island. After a brief respite at Yokosuka, the ship sailed back to the United States, reaching Long Beach on 3 March. For the next seven months, she held numerous training operations and availability periods but was underway west again on 4 November, bound for Oahu on the first leg of her deployment. Once in Hawaiian waters, the destroyer held exercises with combined American and Canadian forces and then continued on to Yokosuka for a brief upkeep period before sailing to the Taiwan Strait for patrol duty. Alfred A. Cunningham underway, circa 1969. Cunningham proceeded to the Gulf of Tonkin early in January 1967 to serve as a plane guard for to assist in recovering downed aviators. In February, the ship was assigned to Operation \\"Sea Dragon\\", a logistics interdiction effort in the coastal waters of North Vietnam, and continued this duty into April. Another stint of service in the Taiwan Strait followed, lasting from 6 to 12 April. On the 28th of that month, the destroyer sailed for home where she spent one and a half months preparing for an overhaul. She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 14 July and underwent extensive repairs and alterations. Upon completion of the yard work in November, Cunningham spent a month in independent steaming and undergoing tender availability. The destroyer began 1968 with refresher training in San Diego and then was deployed once more to southeast Asian waters. She repeated her former pattern of plane guard and search and rescue operations off the Vietnamese coast. On 23 October, the ship set course for home, made fueling stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, and arrived back in Long Beach on 9 November. On 2 January 1969, Cunningham took part in Operation \\"Quickstart\\", and plane guarded for . The destroyer maintained a full schedule of exercises and availability periods until 1 July, when a shaft bearing casualty caused her to enter the Todd Shipyard at San Pedro, California, for repairs. Emerging from drydock on 6 September, Cunningham began an intensive one-month period of preparations for deployment. The destroyer left Long Beach in early October and sailed to Pearl Harbor for refueling; she then conducted port calls at Yokosuka, Buckner Bay, and Subic Bay. On 14 November, the destroyer stood out of Subic Bay for duty off Vietnam. From 19 November until 4 December, she supported forces ashore with fire from her 5-inch guns. On 5 December, she joined Hancock on \\"Yankee Station\\" and remained there until the 20th when she headed for Sasebo for the holidays. Cunningham began the year of 1970 with ASW and flight operations in Okinawan waters which were followed by a five-day visit to Hong Kong. On 17 January, she sailed to join Constellation on \\"Yankee Station\\" and remained on this assignment until 21 February when the ship paid a brief visit to Kaohsiung. The destroyer sailed on 21 March to return to Long Beach. Upon her arrival on 9 April, she began a leave and upkeep period and then resumed operations in the southern California area in May. She spent the early summer months in training exercises and a midshipman training cruise, sailing from Long Beach to San Francisco, Victoria (Canada), Pearl Harbor, and then back to Long Beach. On 7 August, slated for inactivation, Cunningham unloaded all her ammunition at Seal Beach, California (USA). Fate and awards Decommissioned on 24 February 1971, Alfred A. Cunningham was placed in reserve. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1974. Utilized as a target for weapons tests off the coast of Southern California, she was sunk after being hit with five laser-guided bombs on 12 October 1979. Cunningham earned one battle star for World War II service, six for Korea, and seven for Vietnam. In 2007, World War II crewman Walter Hart was awarded Eagle Scout, which he had completed before joining the Navy and serving on Cunningham. References * External links *navsource.org: USS Alfred A.

It was one of a series of offensives, known as the Kaiserschlacht, launched by the Germans in the spring and summer of 1918. Background The massive surprise attack (named Bl√ºcher-Yorck after two Prussian generals of the Napoleonic Wars) lasted from 27 May until 4 June 1918 and was the first full-scale German offensive following the Lys Offensive in Flanders in April. The Germans held the Chemin des Dames Ridge from the First Battle of the Aisne in September 1914 to 1917, when General Mangin captured it during the Second Battle of the Aisne (in the Nivelle Offensive). Operation Bl√ºcher-Yorck was planned primarily by General Erich Ludendorff, the First Quartermaster-General of the German Army, who was certain that success at the Aisne would lead the German armies to within striking distance of Paris. Ludendorff, who saw the British Expeditionary Force as the main threat, believed that this, in turn, would cause the Allies to move forces from Flanders to help defend the French capital, allowing the Germans to continue their planned Flanders offensive (Hagen) with greater ease. Thus, the Aisne drive was to be essentially a large diversionary attack. The defense of the Aisne area was in the hands of General Denis Auguste Duch√™ne, commander of the French Sixth Army. In addition, four divisions of the British IX Corps, led by Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon, held the Chemin des Dames Ridge; they had been posted there to rest and refit after surviving the \\"Michael\\" battle.'' Battle Men of the Worcestershire Regiment holding the southern bank of the River Aisne at Maizy, 27 May 1918. On the morning of 27 May 1918, the Germans began a bombardment (Feuerwalze) of the Allied front lines with over 4,000 artillery pieces. The British suffered heavy losses, because Duchene was reluctant to abandon the Chemin des Dames ridge, after it had been captured at such cost the previous year, and had ordered them to mass together in the front trenches, in defiance of instructions from the French Commander-in-Chief Henri-Philippe Petain. Huddled together, they made easy artillery targets.Hart 2008, pp 266‚Äì8 The bombardment was followed by a poison gas drop. Once the gas had lifted, the main infantry assault by 17 German Sturmtruppen divisions commenced, part of an Army Group nominally commanded by Crown Prince Wilhelm, the eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser came to inspect the progress of the battle. He interviewed captured British Brigadier-General Hubert Rees (GOC 150th Brigade, part of 50th Division). The Kaiser was amused to learn that he was Welsh, the same nationality as Lloyd George.Hart 2008, pp 283 Taken completely by surprise and with their defences spread thin, the Allies were unable to stop the attack and the German army advanced through a gap in the Allied lines. Reaching the Aisne in under six hours, the Germans smashed through eight Allied divisions on a line between Reims and Soissons, pushing the Allies back to the river Vesle and gaining an extra 15 km of territory by nightfall. The rapid advance resulted in the capture of just over 50,000 Allied soldiers and over 800 guns by 30 May 1918, prompting Ludendorff to change the operational objective from merely drawing away the enemy forces from the right wing of the German Army to advancing the attack of the Seventh Army. This had never been the intention of the operation, and having come within of Paris on 3 June, the German armies were beset by numerous problems, including heavy casualties, a lack of reserves, fatigue and supply shortages.David Zabecki in The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study in The Operational Level of War, p.286 Ultimately, following many Allied counter- attacks, the German advance came to a halt three days later. Aftermath Despite penetrating Allied lines by approximately 34 miles and coming closer to Paris than any time since 1914, the Germans were successfully halted by the Allies at the Marne on 6 June 1918. By the battle's end, the Germans had suffered 130,000 casualties while the combined total of the Allies reached up to 137,000. Marix Evans, p.105 For his poor handling of the British and French troops, Duchene was sacked by French Commander-in-Chief Philippe Petain and replaced as commander of the Sixth Army by Jean Degoutte. The battle also marked one of the first instances where an appreciable numbers of American troops participated and had proven themselves in combat. Ludendorff, encouraged by the gains of Bl√ºcher-Yorck, launched further offensives culminating in the Second Battle of the Marne.

It was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS- DOS, Macintosh, and ZX Spectrum. Instead of the wireframe graphics of the original, Starglider 2 uses flat shaded polygons. Plot and gameplay The game features open, continuous gameplay without levels or loading screens after the game had started, despite taking place across an entire planetary system. The player can fly through space, enter a planet's atmosphere, explore the surface, and penetrate tunnels in one seamless movement. The goal of Starglider 2 is to destroy an enemy space station with a neutron bomb, and the majority of the gameplay consists of collecting parts for the bomb, or fulfilling other prerequisites (e.g. finding the nuclear professor capable of constructing the bomb, or trade goods for the bombs necessary to destroy the shield generators protecting the space station), while fighting off enemy spacecraft, and delivering collected items to depots inside planetary tunnel systems. The various objects needed to complete the game are distributed across the many planets of the solar system, as well as in the intervening space (e.g. asteroids and space pirates), or even in the atmosphere of the gas giant planet. Screenshot of Starglider 2 for the Amiga The flight model is arcade-style as opposed to realistic, as the game features no inertia; the spacecraft banks like an aircraft to turn, in air, outer space, and underground; and it is possible to hover. In addition, the game features many graphic display options, including the ability to eliminate roll, or view the game from outside the cockpit from a non-chase-camera, making it difficult to fly but allowing the player to view the polygonal model of the spacecraft. The construction of the shield generators and the space station itself progresses continuously over the course of the game, and failure to destroy the space station before construction was complete will result in loss of the game (the space station would be used to destroy the player's home planet). Successfully destroying the space station will not end the game, despite treating the player to a spectacular explosion and congratulatory text; instead, it will simply reset the construction of the space station, and the player can again begin attempting to gain possession of another neutron bomb with which to destroy the station. Atari ST and Amiga versions The Atari ST version is one of the few action games that could run on that machine's mono display. The Atari ST and Amiga versions use Argonaut's \\"Argonaut Dual Loading System\\", a system whereby the disks are supposed to be interchangeable; the Atari ST disk can be used to load the game onto an Amiga and vice versa.http://birdsanctuary.co.uk/adls/ The Bird Sanctuary's article on ADLS This was supposed to save money, by allowing publishers to produce a single boxed version of the game for both formats. In practice, the system was unreliable, and after Starglider 2 it was abandoned. Reception A review in Computer Gaming World praised the game for being a vast improvement over the original, saying the game had \\"no real weak points\\". Minor criticisms were levelled at the game's joystick controls (preferring to control the game with a mouse) and at the game's philosophy of leaving players no clue as to how to succeed. Compute! cited the game's dual-booting feature as \\"just one of the achievements\\" of the developers, praising the addition of solid graphics without losing its predecessor's speed. Zzap!64 called the game \\"A perfect demonstration just what an Amiga can do,\\" and concluded, \\"An (sic) unanimous decision in the ZZAP! office: the best Amiga game yet, and gave an overall score of 98%.

As a choral conductor he directed the Columbia University Collegium Musicum. He played the viola da gamba with the Aulos Ensemble from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. Taruskin received his B.A. magna cum laude (1965), M.A. (1968) and Ph.D. in historical musicology (1976) from Columbia University. Career Taruskin's extensive 1996 study Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works through Mavra shows that Igor Stravinsky drew more heavily on Russian folk material than has previously been recognized, and analyzes the historical trends that caused Stravinsky not to be forthcoming about some of these borrowings. Taruskin has also written extensively for lay readers, including numerous articles in The New York Times, many of which have been collected in Text and Act (in which he is an influential critic of the premises of the \\"historically informed performance\\" movement in classical music), The Danger of Music and Other Anti-Utopian Essays, and On Russian Music.

Between 1895 and 1906 he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Austria-Hungary. He was responsible for a period of d√©tente in Austrian relations with Imperial Russia, harmed due to the Austrian and Russian struggle for control of the Bosporus. From 1907 he headed the Polish Group in the House of Lords, the higher chamber of the Austrian parliament. Early life He was a son of Count Agenor Go≈Çuchowski, who descended from an old and noble Polish family, was governor of Galicia. His brother, Adam Go≈Çuchowski, was also an MP and Marshal of Galicia. Entering the diplomatic service, the son was in 1872 appointed attach√© to the Austrian embassy in Berlin, where he became secretary of legation, and thence he was transferred to Paris. After rising to the rank of counsellor of legation, he was in 1887 made minister at Bucharest, where he remained until 1893. Career Go≈Çuchowski at his desk, 1901. Portrait of Go≈Çuchowski, by Kazimierz Pochwalski. In these positions he acquired a great reputation as a firm and skilful diplomatist, and on the retirement of Count K√°lnoky in May 1895 was chosen to succeed him as Austro-Hungarian minister for foreign affairs. The appointment of a Pole caused some surprise in view of the importance of Austrian relations with Russia (then rather strained) and Germany, but the choice was justified by events. In his speech of that year to the delegations he declared the maintenance of the Triple Alliance, and in particular the closest intimacy with Germany, to be the keystone of Austrian policy; at the same time he dwelt on the traditional friendship between Austria and Great Britain and expressed his desire for a good understanding with all the powers. In pursuance of this policy he effected an understanding with Russia, by which neither power was to exert any separate influence in the Balkan peninsula, and thus removed a long-standing cause of friction. This understanding was formally ratified during a visit to Saint Petersburg, on which he accompanied the emperor in April 1897. He took the lead in establishing the European concert during the Armenian massacres of 1896, and again resisted isolated action on the part of any of the great powers during the Cretan troubles and the Greco-Turkish War. In November 1897, when the Austro-Hungarian flag was insulted at Mersina, he threatened to bombard the town if instant reparation were not made, and by his firm attitude greatly enhanced Austrian prestige in the East. In his speech to the delegations in 1898 he dwelt on the necessity of expanding Austria's mercantile marine, and of raising the fleet to a strength which, while not vying with the fleets of the great naval powers, would ensure respect for the Austrian flag wherever her interests needed protection. He also hinted at the necessity for European combination to resist American competition. The understanding with Russia in the matter of the Balkan states temporarily endangered friendly relations with Italy, who thought her interests threatened, until Go≈Çuchowski guaranteed in 1898 the existing order. He further encouraged a good understanding with Italy by personal conferences with the Italian foreign minister, Tommaso Tittoni, in 1904 and 1905. Count Lamsdorff visited Vienna in December 1902, when arrangements were made for concerted action in imposing on the sultan reforms in the government of Macedonia. Further steps were taken (the M√ºrzsteg reforms) after Go≈Çuchowski's interview with the tsar at M√ºrzsteg in 1903, and two civil agents representing the countries were appointed for two years to ensure the execution of the promised reforms. This period was extended in 1905, when Go≈Çuchowski was the chief mover in forcing the Porte, by an international naval demonstration at Mitylene, to accept financial control by the powers in Macedonia. At the Algeciras Conference assembled to settle the First Moroccan Crisis, Austria supported the German position, and after the close of the conferences the emperor Wilhelm II of Germany telegraphed to Go≈Çuchowski: \\"You have proved yourself a brilliant second on the duelling ground and you may feel certain of like services from me in similar circumstances\\". This pledge was redeemed in 1908, when Germany's support of Austria in the Balkan crisis proved conclusive. By the Hungarians, however, Go≈Çuchowski was hated; he was suspected of having inspired the emperor's opposition to the use of Magyar in the Hungarian army, and was made responsible for the slight offered to the Magyar deputation by Franz Joseph I of Austria in September 1905. So long as he remained in office there was no hope of arriving at a settlement of a matter which threatened the disruption of the Dual Monarchy, and on the 11 October 1906 he was forced to resign. From 1895, he was also a conservative member of the Herrenhaus (House of Lords) of the Imperial Parliament in Vienna, and from 1907 was chairman of the influential ‚ÄúPoland Block,‚Äù the group of Polish members. Once Congress Poland had been conquered in the First World War, he supported the ‚ÄòAustrian solution', that is joining Congress Poland to Austria, thus marinating the ‚Äòdual‚Äô (Austria and Hungary) monarchy, as opposed to the ‚Äòtripartite‚Äô solution of uniting Congress Poland with Austrian Galicia as a third constituent part of a Triple Monarchy (Austria, Hungary, and Poland).Heinz Lemke: Allianz und Rivalit√§t.

The teacher uses the interactive writing session to model reading and writing strategies as he or she engages children in creating text. Interactive writing was also included by Fountas & Pinnell as part of their balanced literacy framework. Similar to shared writing, interactive writing allows a teacher and students to literally \\"share the pen\\" to create a joint sentence or message. Typically used in the primary grades, interactive writing is a powerful instructional medium for teaching phonics, spelling principles, rimes, writing conventions, and other key early writing skills. This form of interactive writing is thoroughly explained and detailed in the book Interactive Writing: How Language & Literacy Come Together, K-2 by Andrea McCarrier, Gay Su Pinnell, and Irene Fountas. Others have described interactive writing differently as a method used in literacy teaching, especially for young children, whereby the students have the opportunity to practice their reading, studying and writing skills in a safe and creative environment. In this method the teacher(s) and students write to each other, by means of letters, dialogue journals or a message board. The students are free to choose the topic and the length of their writings. The teachers respond without correcting or criticising the spelling, grammar or writing style, but rather modelling more appropriate forms of writing. The aim of this method is to allow children to see literacy as something meaningful and enjoyable, rather than a mind-numbing school activity. The focus is on fluency rather than accuracy. The principle behind it is 'write to learn, not learn to write'. As such it relates to the learner- centered whole language approach. The interactive writing method has been described in books such as: Peyton, Joy Kreeft (ed.) (1990) Students and Teachers Writing Together: Perspectives on Journal Writing. Robinson, A., L. Crawford & N. Hall (1990) some day you will no all about me: Young Children's Explorations in the World of Letter Writing. Reference Swartz, Stanley L. et al., (2001).

This was done in an attempt to protect themselves from the conflict between Samsam al-Dawla and Sharaf al-Dawla. Nevertheless, after a few years Sharaf al-Dawla invaded and occupied Khuzestan and Basra, causing the two princes to flee to Fakhr al-Dawla's territory. There they found refuge in Ray. Neither of the two brothers managed to found any lasting line; consequently their role in Buyid politics was short.

(The New York Times, June 14, 1962) Written by Norman Krasna, based on Krasna's story of the same name, the film was produced and copyrighted in 1961 by MacLaine's then-husband Steve Parker The world premiere was at the Plaza Theatre in London's West End on January 18, 1962.The Times online archive 18/1/1962, Page 2  Plot  Paul Robaix (Montand), a famous director, wants to film the Puccini opera on location in Japan under the title Madame Butterfly, with the dialogue spoken in English and the score sung in Italian. His wife, Lucy Dell (MacLaine), has been the leading lady in all of his greatest films, and she is more famous. He feels that she overshadows him and he would like to achieve success independent of her. By choosing to film Madam Butterfly, he can select a different leading lady without hurting her feelings, because she, as a blue eyed, red headed woman, would not be suitable to play a Japanese woman. As a surprise, she visits him in Japan while he's searching for a leading lady. To surprise him further, she disguises herself as a geisha at a dinner party, planning to unveil her identity during the meal. But she is delighted to discover that everyone at the dinner party, including her husband, believes her to be a Japanese woman. When she learns that the studio has decided to only give her husband enough funds to film the movie in black and white because there are no big stars in the film, she decides that she will audition for the role of Butterfly, without telling her husband, but that the studio will know and therefore give him the budget he needs to make the film he wants. She gets the part and is wonderful. Through the course of the film, Lucy Dell begins to become concerned that Yoko will steal her husband's affections, though he never does develop feelings for the invented character. When viewing the film's negatives, with the colors reversed, he figures out her duplicity and, thinking she is doing it to steal credit from him so that once again he will not get the artistic praise he deserves, he becomes furious. To retaliate, he decides to proposition Yoko. Greatly distressed, she flees. Paul then entertains the idea of divorce for what he sees as him being betrayed by his wife. Their \\"reunion\\" before the premiere is cold, Paul believing she will expose her identity there for betraying him, and Lucy believing that Paul was trying to sleep with Yoko. Her original plan was, at the end of the premiere, to reveal Yoko's true identity, which will astound Hollywood and practically guarantee her an Oscar. Instead, her then trusted friend, Kazumi, gives her a present of a fan that was owned by a very popular geisha. The fan was inscribed with the saying: \\"No one before you, my husband, not even I.\\" So, she takes off her geisha makeup, appears as herself, tells everyone that Yoko went into a convent and will no longer be performing, and keeps her identity secret. She and her husband reconcile when he informs Lucy that he knew she was Yoko.Duncan, Chuck. \\"My Geisha is a politically incorrect product of its time\\" (ClicqueClack, July 10, 2014)  Cast  *Shirley MacLaine as Lucy Dell *Yves Montand as Paul Robaix *Edward G.

It was generally a crossroads between eastern and western segments of Northern Africa, from the time of Carthage to the end of the Byzantine Empire from the continent.  History  Saldae was first inhabited by Numidian Berbers. A minor port in Carthaginian and in early Roman times, it was a border town between Rome and Juba, located to the east of the ancient Berber kingdoms. = Roman era = It was made officially a Roman colony -named Civitas Salditana- during the reign of Roman emperor Octavianus Augustus. It is mentioned in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia.Pliny the Elder: Natural History \\"Rusazus, a colony of Augustus, Saldae, a colony of the same, Igilgili likewise; the town of Zucca, situated on the sea and the river Ampsaga.\\" The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites reports: Roman \\"cippus\\" and inscribed tablets to Nonius Datus Roman vaulted cistern roof at the foot of the Toudja aqueduct The city grew in size with new buildings and the emperor Vespasian settled the city with many Roman veterans, increasing its population and importance in the province of Mauretania Caesariensis, and when that was divided, in the new Late Roman province of Mauretania Sitifensis. The city was under the Roman ius (law) and its citizens were endowed with full civil rights. Saldae was a center of a Mauretania Caesariensis area fully Romanised, that in the late third century was even fully Christian. In the 3rd century AD, Gaius Cornelius Peregrinus, a decurion (town councillor) of Saldae, was a tribunus (military tribune, a commander at cohort level) of the auxiliary garrison at Alauna Carvetiorum, in northern Britain. An altar dedicated by him was discovered shortly before 1587 in the north-west corner of the fort, where it had probably been re-used in a late-Roman building (British Museum, Description of the altar). Ancient arch = Vandal, Byzantine and modern era = In the 5th century, Saldae became the capital of the short-lived Vandal Kingdom of the Germanic Vandals, which ended in about 533 with the Byzantine conquest, which established an African prefecture and later the Exarchate of Carthage. After the 7th-century Arab conquest, Saldae declined and had practically disappeared by the end of the first millennium. In the 11th century, it was refounded as B√©ja√Øa (v.) by the Berber Hammadid dynasty, which made it their capital, and it became an important port and centre of culture.  Ecclesiastical history  With the spread of Christianity, Saldae became a bishopric. Its bishop Paschasius was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to the Council of Carthage (484) and then exiled. Christianity survived the Arab conquest, the disappearance of the old city of Saldae, and the founding of the new city of B√©ja√Øa. A letter of Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì1085) exists, addressed to clero et populo Buzee (the clergy and people of B√©ja√Øa), in which he writes of the consecration of a bishop named Servandus for Christian north Africa.Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, Brescia 1816, p. 269H.

The Duke of York's Picture House is an art house cinema in Brighton, England, which lays claim to being the oldest cinema in continuous use in Britain.Duke of York's Cinema: A Brief History According to cinema historian Allen Eyles, the cinema \\"deserves to be named Britain's oldest cinema\\".Eyles, Allen, Picturehouse Magazine Autumn 2000 'The Oldest Cinema?' In 2012 it was voted best Cinema in the UK. The Duke of York's cinema was built at the cost of ¬£3000 by actress-manager Violet Melnotte-Wyatt. It opened on 22 September 1910 and was one of Brighton's first picture palaces and also one of the first cinemas in the world. It was built on the site of the Amber Ale Brewery, the walls of which still form the rear part of the auditorium. The architects were Clayton & Black. The building remains largely unaltered, it even retains one of its boxes in the balcony area. The original colour scheme was red and cream. The Duke of York's was always a quality cinema for the more discerning patron, its marketing tag-line for many years was \\"Bring her to the Duke's, it is fit for a Duchess.\\" The name came from the West End theatre which its first proprietor Mrs Melnotte- Wyatt was also associated with. Being slightly outside the town centre, the Duke's catered for its local audience and this has been its saving grace. While other cinemas in Brighton came and went, The Duke of York's has remained in continuous operation. The cinema has operated as an arts cinema since 1981 and has passed through several owners and hosted illegal punk rock concerts. The cinema was in a shabby state when it was purchased in 1994 by Picturehouse Cinemas who have invested in the building and returned it to its former glory. Detail on an exterior pillar. It houses one single screen with 278 seats, including a luxury balcony. It originally seated over 800, but modifications have been made to the inside of the building to create the caf√©/bar upstairs, a concession space downstairs, and to allow for greater comfort. In 1991, a 20 ft pair of can-can dancer's legs were acquired from the recently closed Not The Moulin Rouge Theatre in Oxford, and were installed onto the outside front balcony. These were later moved to their current position on the roof during a refurbishment in 1995. Opening day, 22 September 1910 The building is a Grade II listed building. In 2007, it launched an appeal to replace its leaking roof. Over ¬£25,000 was raised from public donations, benefit concerts (from local band The Go! Team), benefit screenings and 'sponsor-a-seat' programme. The roof was replaced in April 2008. The balcony was remodelled at the same time to create luxury sofas and armchairs. It plays host to the Brighton Film Festival each year, CineCity, organised between The Duke of York's and the University of Brighton. It counts as patrons Brighton residents Nick Cave and filmmaker John Hillcoat, as well as actor/comedian Steve Coogan. Between 2006 and 2016, The Duke of York's was home to Picturehouse Cinema's monthly online magazine programme Flick's Flicks. The 10-minute show highlighted up-and- coming films and events at Picturehouse venues across the country and was presented by Felicity Beckett - the Duke of York's associate manager at the time. Originally hosted on ITVLocal.com, it then moved to Picturehouse's own website and social network pages. Famous faces to have been interviewed on the show include Kristin Scott Thomas and John Hurt. The cinema regularly hosts events such as fancy-dress film premieres, all night Lord of the Rings marathons and late night cult screenings. In 2009, then manager Jon Barrenechea and staff member Robert Breames started a monthly film review podcast recorded in the cinema projection room called Splendor Cinema, which counted Ben Wheatley and Mark Kermode among its guests. When Jon left his position as general manager in late 2013, this was replaced by a new show called Live at the Essoldo Cinema Podcast, named after a defunct Brighton cinema, which Breames co-hosts with marketing manager Toby King.Live At the Essoldo Cinema Podcast, In December 2012, despite becoming part of Cineworld, the general manager Jon Barrenechea promised it would remain an arthouse cinema.John Keenan, Brighton Cinema will stay true to arthouse roots, The Argus, 7 December 2012 That same month, a sister venue called Dukes at Komedia was opened across town in the North Laine, above the Komedia comedy club.

In 1988, Madhavan gained a scholarship to represent India as a cultural ambassador from Rajaram College, Kolhapur and spent a year in Stettler, Alberta, Canada as part of an exchange programme with Rotary International. He returned to Kolhapur and completed his education, graduating with a BSc in Electronics. During his college years, Madhavan became actively involved in extra-curricular military training and at 22, he was recognised as amongst the leading NCC cadets in Maharashtra, which allowed him to make a trip with seven others as NCC cadets to England. As a result of this opportunity, he received training with the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, which he had, at a point, considered joining. However he missed the age cut-off by six months and was subsequently unable to join the programme. After he lost out on the place, he began teaching courses on public speaking and personality development skills in Kolhapur and the satisfaction he gained through teaching, prompted him to pursue a post-graduation in public speaking at Kishinchand Chellaram College in Bombay (present-day Mumbai). During the period, he also won the Indian Championship for Public Speaking and subsequently represented India at the Young Businessmen Conference in Tokyo, Japan in 1992. During his stint in Mumbai, he opted to create a portfolio and submit it to a modelling agency. Acting career =Early work= In early 1996, Madhavan worked on a sandalwood talc advertisement directed by Santosh Sivan, who later recommended him to Mani Ratnam to take part in a screen test for a role in Iruvar (1997). Madhavan was auditioned for the leading role of Tamizhselvan amongst several other more established actors, but Mani Ratnam eventually left him out of the project citing that he thought his \\"eyes looked too young\\" for a senior role. Prior to his film audition, Madhavan was spotted by a television executive while out walking in Lokhandwala in Mumbai, and was recruited to feature in Hindi television serials, appearing as a crook in his first venture Yule Love Stories. He appeared in leading roles in Zee TV's Banegi Apni Baat and Ghar Jamai, while he gained further popularity portraying the character of Shekhar in Saaya. He also went on to act as Lt. Shammi in Aarohan (The Ascent), as a ship's captain in Sea Hawks, as a convict in Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum and worked as a television anchor in Tol Mol Ke Bol amongst other television appearances. His first appearance in a feature film role came through a small role in Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin (1996), where he portrayed a singer in a bar. In 1997, Madhavan appeared in a supporting role as an Indian police officer in Fred Olen Ray's English film, Inferno, which was shot in India. His first chance in Indian cinema came in the form of Shanti Shanti Shanti (1998), a Kannada film, in which he appeared as a carefree youngster alongside actor Abbas. However, the film failed to make an impact and went unnoticed at the box office. During the period, Hindi film director Vinod Pandey launched Madhavan as a Bollywood hero, with a project titled Akeli, however the film was shelved before the production process had been completed. = 1999‚Äì2001: Breakthrough = In 1999, leading Indian director Mani Ratnam selected Madhavan to feature in the leading role of his Tamil romantic film, Alaipayuthey (2000) and the film's subsequent critical and commercial success gave Madhavan his breakthrough as an actor. Portraying the character of Karthik Varadharajan, a young husband experiencing difficulties with his marriage. Madhavan revealed that he studied the technical aspects of film-making from the director and learned the entire script of the film, irrespective of whether he was in the scene or not. He became the first debutant actor to be cast by Mani Ratnam in the lead role of a film, and revealed that when he found out that he was set to work with the director he was overcome with a \\"mixture of excitement, awe, fear and expectations\\". Featuring alongside actress Shalini, Madhavan's performance was well received by critics and the film's success led to it developing \\"classic\\" status. A critic from The Hindu, described that Madhavan \\"sails through the litmus test with ease\\", whilst another review cited that Madhavan was a \\"promising debutant\\" into the film industry. After the success of his first Tamil film, the producers of his previous Kannada film, Shanti Shanti Shanti, dubbed the film into Tamil and released it as Relax, to capitalise on Madhavan's new-found success. Madhavan's next film, Ennavale (2000), garnered mixed reviews although Madhavan's portrayal was praised as the \\"mainstay\\" of the film, with claims that the film for him was a \\"merely a prosaic exercise\\". Madhavan's first release of 2001, Gautham Menon's directorial debut Minnale, opened to critical and commercial acclaim. Featuring a popular soundtrack by Harris Jayaraj and marketed as a Valentine's Day release, Minnale further built on the actor's image as a romantic hero and was later listed as a \\"classic romantic film\\" from the Tamil film industry. He then collaborated with Mani Ratnam for the second time by appearing in the director's production venture, the romantic comedy Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001), alongside Jyothika. Appearing as an unhappy groom trying to halt his wedding, the film won positive acclaim and became a commercial success, with Madhavan establishing himself as a bankable actor in South India. Madhavan then again appeared as a husband in a tumultuous marriage in Parthale Paravasam (2001), the hundredth venture of veteran director K. Balachander. Despite featuring amongst an ensemble cast and being highly anticipated prior to release, the film failed at the box-office, with critics citing that Madhavan looked \\"rather bored\\" with the proceedings. Similarly his first lead role in a Hindi film, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein (2001), a remake of his Minnale, was also unsuccessful at the box office, with the film and Madhavan's performance receiving mixed reviews. However, the film belatedly gained popularity through screenings on television and subsequently developed a cult following amongst young audiences. = 2002‚Äì2004: Critical acclaim = In 2002, Madhavan played the role of a novelist in Mani Ratnam's Kannathil Muthamittal alongside actresses Keerthana, Simran and Nandita Das. In the film, he was shown as the role of the father of an adopted child, who wishes to return to her native homeland amidst the Sri Lankan civil war. The film received widespread critical acclaim and went on to win six National Awards as well as over ten awards at various International Film Festivals. Madhavan gained acclaim for his portrayal with a critic citing \\"he lived the role of the character he portrays\\", with the film seeing him move away from the romantic hero image for the first time into a more serious, performance-orientated role. The good performance of the film internationally also helped him develop an overseas market for his films. Madhavan's next large success came with Run, a film recognised for its screenplay, with Madhavan appearing in an action film for the first time in his career. In regard to his performance, The Hindu's critic noted \\"he manages to portray action with √©lan in Run and actually looks fit and comfortable in the role\\", with the film helping him make a breakthrough as an action hero. Despite another unsuccessful Hindi venture with the musical, Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002), the success of his previous films helped him secure the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for 2002, being jointly recognised for both films. Madhavan was cast alongside Kamal Haasan in Anbe Sivam (2003), which told the story of an unexpected journey from Bhubaneswar to Chennai of two men who are polar opposites. Madhavan revealed his elation at working with an experienced actor like Kamal Haasan, while noting that a human drama film like Anbe Sivam was important for his career as an actor as it came after a successful masala film in Run. Portraying a young frustrated filmmaker with capitalist beliefs who travels with a handicapped communist played by Kamal Haasan, Madhavan's performance was described as a \\"milestone in his career\\" and that \\"his portrayal will remain with the viewer for long\\" by a critic from The Hindu. The film opened in January 2003 to positive reviews, but became a surprise box-office failure. Post-release, the film has garnered belated critical acclaim from critics and television audiences and is considered as one of the \\"cult classics\\" of Tamil cinema. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote that the film \\"was leagues ahead of the average Tamil and Indian film\\", though felt that \\"the masses were unwilling to accept the experimental nature of the film\\", while talking about the film's box office failure. Post-filming, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was impressed with Madhavan's enthusiasm and concentration during the making of the film and thus subsequently signed him on to appear in his production venture, Nala Damayanthi (2003), where he played a Brahmin cook lost in Australia. In 2003, the actor also appeared in Vikraman's family drama Priyamana Thozhi as a budding cricketer, Saran's romantic comedy Jay Jay and made a guest appearance in Priyadarshan's Lesa Lesa as a jailed teacher. The three films made average returns at the box office, though Madhavan's performances were appreciated by critics. Madhavan played an imposter gangster in K. S. Ravikumar's comedy Aethiree (2004) before being selected to feature in his fourth Mani Ratnam production, Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004), which featured him in an ensemble cast including Suriya, Siddharth, Meera Jasmine, Esha Deol and Trisha. Madhavan portrayed the character of Inba Sekhar, a hitman living in the slums of Chennai, whose path crosses with the characters portrayed by Suriya and Siddharth. His role also featured him in a struggling marriage, where his wife desperately tries to claw him away from his profession. Madhavan bulked up and sported a shaven look for the first time in his career to resemble the character of a ruffian and shot for the film through the sync sound technique. He received widespread praise for his depiction, with Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu claiming that Madhavan outplayed Abhishek Bachchan's interpretation of the character in the Hindi version of the bilingual, Yuva. Madhavan went on to win the Filmfare Award for the Best Tamil Supporting Actor, whilst another critic from The Hindu cited that he \\"sparkles as an anti-hero\\" and that the \\"character ought to find a very special place in his repertoire\\". Similarly, a critic from Indiaglitz.com stated \\"Madhavan's daring decision to play a negative character, who gets beaten up black and blue at the end, putting his 'hero' image in peril, has paid off, as he walks away with top honours\\", while a reviewer from Sify.com labelled him as \\"terrific\\". In late 2004, Madhavan worked on Rajiv Anchal's English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing But Life (2005) and completed his work in a single schedule across Las Vegas and Albuquerque. Portraying an orphaned youth with suicidal tendencies being treated by a Malayali psychiatrist in the USA, the film and his portrayal opened to mixed reviews. =2005‚Äì2008: Increased work in Hindi films= Madhavan appeared in another marriage drama film, Priyasakhi (2005) co-starring Sadha ‚Äì with the pair playing an estranged husband and wife. The film received praise for the lead pair's performances with Madhavan being praised as \\"top class\\", while it also became the first Tamil film to be dubbed into Zulu. From 2005 onwards, Madhavan increased his work in Hindi films and starred and wrote the Hindi dialogues for the comedy Ramji Londonwaley (2005), a remake of his earlier film Nala Damayanthi. Critics described his performance as \\"a master stroke\\", though the film fared averagely at the box office due to the release of other big budget films during the period. He experienced box office success in Hindi films for the first time through his role in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Rang De Basanti (2006). Featuring in an ensemble cast led by Aamir Khan, Madhavan essayed the guest role of flight lieutenant, whose death triggers a revolutionary movement against corruption. The film was subsequently nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2006 BAFTA Awards, while it was also chosen as India's official entry for the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards for the Best Foreign Language Film category. Madhavan then collaborated with Mani Ratnam for the fifth time in the biopic Guru (2007), co-starring Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Vidya Balan. His role of Shyam Saxena was inspired from the life of real-life journalist S. Gurumurthy, who was a challenger to the business tycoon, Dhirubhai Ambani, whose life drew allusions with Bachchan's role. The film became a blockbuster and also received critical acclaim, with a reviewer citing that Madhavan acts with \\"extreme, believable sincerity\\" dubbing him as \\"truly a poster boy for India\\", whilst another claimed he performed \\"a weak role with √©lan\\". His Tamil film, Thambi (2006) directed by Seeman, had a delayed release but became a profitable venture in town and village centres. Madhavan's portrayal of a rustic do-gooder, received positive reviews from critics though a reviewer from The Hindu claimed the actor was \\"unable to shed off his classy looks\\". He then appeared in Sundar C's comedy film Rendu (2006), where he played dual roles for the first time and in the long-delayed romantic comedy Aarya (2007), appearing as a medical student. Madhavan wrote the dialogues, produced and featured in the lead role in Nishikanth Kamat's Evano Oruvan (2007), playing a middle class bank employee who becomes so disgusted with the corruption he faces in his day-to- day life that he becomes a vigilante. After setting up a production studio, Leukos Films, he helped promote the film in international film festivals before the theatrical release in December 2007. Critics called the film a \\"must watch\\" and a reviewer from The Hindu stated that the film was \\"Madhavan's best performance to date\\", while he also went on to win the ITFA Best Actor Award for his depiction. However Evano Oruvan and his subsequent release, Seeman's Vaazhthukal (2008) did not perform well at the box office, while another completed film titled Naan Aval Adhu failed to have a theatrical release. Madhavan's final release of the year was the docudrama Mumbai Meri Jaan, based upon the 2006 Mumbai Bombings. The film, which featured him alongside Soha Ali Khan, Irrfan Khan and Kay Kay Menon became critically acclaimed with Madhavan's portrayal of a man with a post-traumatic stress disorder being appreciated by reviewers. =2009‚Äì2015: Further success and sabbatical= Madhavan with co-star Kangana Ranaut at a promotional event for Tanu Weds Manu, 2011 Madhavan won positive acclaim for playing the lead role of an engineer experiencing eerie events in Vikram Kumar's bilingual horror film, Yavarum Nalam (2009). The film, which became a commercial and critical success, prompted a reviewer from the Times of India to suggest \\"he carried the film on his shoulders\\" while he was also nominated in the Best Actor category at the Vijay Awards. His following two films, the romantic comedy Guru En Aalu (2009) and the action film Sikandar (2009) in which he played a supporting role of an army officer, both fetched mixed reviews. Madhavan then portrayed one of three leading roles in Rajkumar Hirani's coming of age comedy-drama film, 3 Idiots (2009), alongside Aamir Khan and Sharman Joshi. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and went on to become the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, before being overtaken in 2013. Madhavan's portrayal as a young engineer with a passion for photography earned him nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor and for the IIFA Best Supporting Actor Award during 2010. Film critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama described the actor's performance as \\"incredible\\", while Madhavan claimed that the film changed how he was viewed as an actor in Hindi films for the better. He later turned down an offer of reprising the same role in the Tamil remake of the film helmed by Shankar. In 2010, Madhavan appeared alongside actors Amitabh Bachchan and Ben Kingsley in Teen Patti (2010) as a young professor, with Adarsh again rating his performance as \\"excellent\\", but the film failed at the box office. His two guest appearances in the year also received mixed feedback with his performance in the Telugu anthology film Om Shanti (2010) being praised, whilst a role in the John Abraham-starrer Jhootha Hi Sahi (2010) drew him criticism. Madhavan then collaborated again with Kamal Haasan and K. S. Ravikumar in the romantic comedy, Manmadan Ambu (2010), playing a wealthy businessman who hires a spy to follow his actress girlfriend on a European cruise tour. The film opened to positive reviews with Madhavan's performance being described by Rediff.com as \\"excellent\\", while Sify.com labelled him the \\"scene stealer\\". His only release in 2011 was the romantic drama film, Tanu Weds Manu alongside Kangana Ranaut, which saw him play the role of a sensible doctor hoping to get an arranged marriage with a girl, who has a dramatically diverse personality to him. Prior to release, the film's promotional campaign created anticipation and upon release, the film became a large success at the box office. Madhavan's portrayal of Manoj Kumar Sharma aka Manu won positive acclaim, with a reviewer citing that his performance was \\"real, restrained, yet forceful\\" and another claiming he was \\"perfectly cast\\". Madhavan next appeared as a police officer in Linguswamy's Tamil film Vettai (2012), an action entertainer featuring an ensemble cast of Arya, Amala Paul and Sameera Reddy.

In 2012, Madhavan took a sabbatical and was based in Chicago resting his knee, which he injured during the making of Vettai, causing him to suffer from chondromalacia patellae. During the period, he felt he had to \\"reinvent himself\\" and had to work on films which would appeal to the \\"new generation of audiences\\", so took a decision to work on a single film at a time.

Prior to the film's release, Madhavan stated that the \\"content of the film was more important than the stars\\" and acknowledged that the popularity of Kangana Ranaut would help the film gain a good opening at the box office. Reprising his role as Manu, Madhavan won acclaim for his restrained performance and the film went on to become a critical and commercial success. The critic from Bollywood Hungama wrote \\"Madhavan excels in his role despite it being a restrained one, which was anyways the call of his character\\" and added \\"he is very endearing who never tries to overshadow anyone and emerges a winner\\", while Sify.com stated he gives a \\"subtle and restrained performance\\". Tanu Weds Manu Returns earned worldwide at the end of its theatrical run, to become one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films in 2015. =2016‚Äì2017: Resurgence= During his sabbatical, Madhavan also worked extensively on the pre-production of the bilingual sports film, Irudhi Suttru (2016) directed by Sudha Kongara. After being impressed with Sudha's script, he helped find the project producers in Tamil and chose to produce the film in Hindi alongside Sashikanth and Rajkumar Hirani. Madhavan also met and convinced mixed martial artist Ritika Singh to act in the film after contacting her through Raj Kundra, while he was also credited for contributing as an additional screenplay writer. He also went through a body conditioning regime in Los Angeles prior to joining the film's set and learnt boxing to essay the role of a former boxer. For dubbing purposes, Madhavan wore metal braces inside his teeth, to create the effect of having a lisp that most boxers have from sporting injuries.

Jha stating \\"this is Madhavan's career-defining performance, he sinks so deep into his role both physically and emotionally, that the actor becomes one with the act\\". He next featured in Vikram Vedha (2017), an action thriller film directed by duo Pushkar-Gayathri and produced by Sashikanth. Telling the tale of an encounter cop and his pursuit of a gangster played by Vijay Sethupathi, Pushkar-Gayathri scripted the film with inspiration from the Vikramathithan Vedhalam folk tale, with the characterisation of both lead roles derived from that plot. For his role, Madhavan underwent arms training and met people involved with the police and defence forces.

For Breathe, Madhavan studied his own experience as a father besides researching the complexities surrounding organ donation. In the series, he played Danny Mascarenhas, a soccer coach and the father of a young boy with cystic fibrosis, who will die in six months unless he has a lung transplant. Madhavan received positive reviews for his portrayal, with film critic Subhash K. Jha writing \\"As Danny, Madhavan expresses grief, rage, frustration, guilt, repentance and self-destruction with measured excellence\\" and that \\"this is a showcase for an actor at the peak of his power\\" and \\"boy, does Madhavan embrace the opportunity\\". Similarly, a critic from the New Indian Express wrote \\"Madhavan is in form in a potentially compelling thriller\\", and a reviewer from the International Business Times wrote he \\"shows a range of emotions\\" in \\"a smooth, beautiful way\\".

In October 2007, Madhavan founded the production company, Leukos Films, and consequently bought the rights of his film, Evano Oruvan, from producers Abbas-Mustan and K. Sera Sera. Securing sponsorship deals with HSBC and Santoor, Madhavan premi√®red the film across North America and the Middle East before its Indian theatrical release, with the promotion method being used for the first time in Tamil cinema. However, since the relative box office failure of the project, Madhavan downplayed future involvement in production ventures. The film, which Madhavan referred to as a \\"part of his life\\" during 2007, also saw him write the dialogues for the film along with Seeman by translating lines from the project's original version in the Marathi language. Madhavan then chose to become actively involved in the production of his 2016 bilingual films, Irudhi Suttru in Tamil and Saala Khadoos in Hindi, to ensure the film completed filming and had a theatrical release. Impressed by the strength of Sudha Kongara's script for the Tamil film, Madhavan felt that the story had pan-Indian appeal and took the film's script to Rajkumar Hirani, who agreed to produce and supervise work on the film's Hindi version. Madhavan co-produced the Hindi version of the film through his new production house, Tricolor Films, while leading the film's pan-Indian marketing campaign.

However, Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the show in January 2006 claiming he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had made it clear that he would continue with his South Indian film assignments, and as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep traveling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. Madhavan added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue. Mandira Bedi subsequently replaced Madhavan as the anchor in February for Series 2 of the game show.

In the other game titled Madhavan, the player had to help the actor get to the premi√®re of his latest movie evading the paparazzi. In 2007, prominent entrepreneur N. R. Narayana Murthy requested Madhavan to be his interviewer at the India- Singapore Exposition and Madhavan went on to claim that the experience was \\"unforgettable\\" as Murthy was an idol to him. Madhavan has attended conferences as a motivational speaker, talking about issues including situational awareness and confidence, with a speech delivered at Damodaran Academy of Management, Coimbatore going viral online. Madhavan also took part and delivered speeches as a part of the annual India Conference at Harvard University during 2017. Personal life After completing the degree, he went on to teach communication and public speaking at workshops around India. At the Maharashtra workshop, he encountered his wife Sarita Birje for the first time in 1991, when she attended his class on the recommendation of her cousins. Sarita was able to use the skills she had learned from Madhavan's classes to pass an interview to become an air hostess and after completing the course, the pair began dating. They married in 1999, before Madhavan entered mainstream films. The pair's marriage has been covered by the media, with Madhavan citing that advice from his mentor Mani Ratnam was useful. Sarita has worked as a costume designer in a few of Madhavan's films, most notably for Guru En Aalu (2009), when she worked along with Erum Ali, the wife of Madhavan's co-star, Abbas, for their respective husbands. Their son, Vedaant, was born in August 2005, which eventually led to relocating to the boat-club area in Chennai from Kilpauk, where Madhavan's parents lived with him as well as his parents-in-law. In 2009, he relocated to Kandivali, Mumbai, with his wife and son, as he pursued a career in Hindi films ahead of films in the South Indian industries. Madhavan has maintained close links with fellow actors and has described actor Suriya as his best friend in the film industry. The actor also is close friends with actresses Shilpa Shetty and Bipasha Basu, as well as actors Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan. He is closely associated with actor Kamal Haasan, after their appearance together in Anbe Sivam, and has revealed that he considers the actor as his inspiration. He has also collaborated multiple times with directors Mani Ratnam, Rajkumar Hirani and Aanand Rai, citing that the film makers \\"understand him well\\" and share a good \\"comfort level\\". He has also helped out actresses Reemma Sen, Sadha and Nisha Kothari by signing them on for roles in his films, when they were going through a barren spell. Madhavan announced a sabbatical from films in late 2010 citing he would take the time off to visit London, lose weight, play golf, take treatment for his knee injury and spend time with family. Though he kept away from starting new projects, during the period he was involved in the promotional activity of two of his releases, Manmadan Ambu and Tanu Weds Manu. He later made a comeback, earlier than anticipated, after director Linguswamy convinced him to work on Vettai. The actor later took an extended sabbatical from 2012 onwards to work on his fitness and get into shape for his role as a retired boxer in Irudhi Suttru. Madhavan is a keen golf player, having played for pleasure alongside actor Amitabh Bachchan and director Mani Ratnam, while also appearing in a celebrity charity event in 2007. In 2017, he won the qualification round of the Mumbai leg of the Mercedes Trophy golf meet and subsequently qualified for the National Finals.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/actor-madhavn-qualifies-national- finals-mercedes-trophy-golf-meet-74616 He also made an appearance for Chennai Rhinos in the 2011 Celebrity Cricket League, playing against Karnataka Bulldozers. His experiences flying Cessna planes when he was with National Cadet Corps, also led to a passion for aero-modelling, with the actor stating it \\"justified his decision\\" to pursue a degree in electronics.

Ringer (born 1938) is an American entrepreneur, motivational and political speaker, and author of several best-selling personal-development and political books.

It became a #1 bestseller, spending 36 weeks at the top of The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2002, Ringer revised and updated the book and republished it with a new title: To Be or Not to Be Intimidated?: That is the Question. Ringer says that the change in the title was made to clarify his aim in these books, which is not so much to turn people into intimidators, but rather to give people the tools to keep others from intimidating them. Ringer also self-published his second book, Looking Out for#1, in 1977, which, like his first book, became a New York Times #1 bestseller. Ringer's recurring themes of actions based on rational thought, conceding and in fact adhering to the inherent objective human nature of self-interest, and avoiding people who are irrational (which he labelled either neurotics or \\"weeds\\") was expounded on, among other things. Ringer's first political/ideological work, Restoring the American Dream (1979), reached #3 on The New York Times Bestseller List in 1979, and was revised, updated, and republished in 2010. The premise of the book is that liberty must be given a higher priority than all other objectives and that a laissez-faire free market is the clear solution to America's economic troubles. In addition to his own bestselling books, Ringer has published a number of other authors‚Äô works, and at one time had a string of four New York Times bestsellers in a row.

She gave birth to his son Liu Zhao (ÂäâËÇá) in 79, but her son was adopted by Emperor Zhang's wife Empress Dou and would not know his birth mother's identity until a long time later, after he became emperor (as Emperor He). Life Consort Liang was a daughter of Liang Song (Ê¢ÅÁ´¶), the son of one of Emperor Guangwu's officials, Liang Tong (Ê¢ÅÁµ±). When she was 15, in 77, both she and her older sister became consort to Emperor Zhang (who was then 20). At the time Consort Liang's son Prince Zhao was adopted by Empress Dou, Emperor Zhang had already created his son Liu Qing (ÂäâÊÖ∂), by another favorite, Consort Song, crown prince. Empress Dou made false accusations against Consort Song and her sister (also an imperial consort), however, and the Consorts Song were forced to commit suicide in 82. Crown Prince Qing was deposed, and Prince Zhao was created crown prince in his stead. The Liang clan did not dare to celebrate openly, but they were happy about that development. Empress Dou and her clan were not pleased, and, wanting to make sure that the Liangs would not step in and exert influence on the young prince, they also made false accusations against Liang Song, and he was arrested and died in prison in 83. His family was exiled to modern northern Vietnam. Consort Liang and her sister died in sadness, probably in 83 as well. Her son would succeed to the throne in 88, believing that Empress Dowager Dou was his mother. After Empress Dowager Dou died in 97, officials revealed to Emperor He that Consort Liang was actually his birth mother. While Emperor He rejected a recommendation to posthumously demote Empress Dowager Dou, he reburied his mother and aunt with great honors (but not with his father -- that honor was reserved for Empress Dowager Dou, as his father's wife). He also posthumously rewarded his mother the title of empress.Empresses and Consorts: Selections from Chen Shou's Records of the Three States with Pei Songzhi's Commentary, translated by Robert Joe Cutter and William Gordon Crowell (University of Hawaii Press, 1999), p. 116.

It was built in 1910‚Äì12 by architect Edwin Lutyens, who combined an existing mid-15th century house on the site with a similar structure brought from Benenden, Kent, together with his own additions. It is a Grade I listed building. The garden, widely known for its continuous tradition of sophisticated plantsmanship, is Grade I listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.  House  The long border within the garden The original Northiam house, known as Dixter, dating from the mid-15th century, was acquired by a businessman named Nathaniel Lloyd in 1909. He had a 16th-century house in a similar style moved from Kent and the two were combined with new work by Lutyens to create a much larger house, which was rechristened Great Dixter. It is a romantic recreation of a medieval manor house, complete with great hall, parlour, solar and yeoman's hall.Information from free Great Dixter leaflet  Garden  Lloyd and Lutyens began the garden at Great Dixter, but it was Lloyd's son Christopher Lloyd, a well known garden writer and television personality, who made it famous. The garden is in the arts and crafts style, and features topiary, a long border, an orchard and a wild flower meadow. The planting is profuse, yet structured, and has featured many bold experiments of form, colour and combination. The garden is currently managed by Fergus Garrett, who worked closely with Lloyd up until his death in 2006 as Head Gardener and introduced a number of innovations into the planting scheme. In the grounds of Great Dixter are three 18th-century oast houses, under a common roof, and a 15th-century barn. These are Grade II* listed.

Names The common name 'guelder rose' relates to the Dutch province of Gelderland, where a popular cultivar, the snowball tree, supposedly originated.The Reader's Digest Field Guide to the Trees and Shrubs of Britain p.143. Other common names include water elder, cramp bark, snowball tree, common snowball, and European cranberrybush, though this plant is not closely related to the cranberry. Some botanists also include the North American species Viburnum trilobum as V. opulus var. americanum Ait., or as V. opulus subsp. trilobum (Marshall) Clausen. Phylogeny The guelder rose is a member of the Viburnum genus which contains 160-170 species. It is classified in the subsection Opulus which usually contains 5 species. Phylogenetic anlyses suggest the following relationship between those species: Description Flowers (left) and fruit Viburnum opulus is a deciduous shrub growing to tall. The leaves are opposite, three-lobed, long and broad, with a rounded base and coarsely serrated margins; they are superficially similar to the leaves of some maples, most easily distinguished by their somewhat wrinkled surface with impressed leaf venation. The leaf buds are green, with valvate bud scales. The hermaphrodite flowers are white, produced in corymbs in diameter at the top of the stems; each corymb comprises a ring of outer sterile flowers 1.5‚Äì2 cm in diameter with conspicuous petals, surrounding a center of small (5 mm), fertile flowers; the flowers are produced in early summer, and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose bright red drupe 7‚Äì10 mm diameter, containing a single seed. The seeds are dispersed by birds. Cultivation 'Roseum', syn. 'Snowball' Viburnum opulus berries in Novosibirsk, Siberian Russia Viburnum opulus is grown as an ornamental plant for its flowers and berries, growing best on moist, moderately alkaline soils, though tolerating most soil types well. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Roseum' (synonym 'Sterile', 'Snowball'), in which all the flowers are only of the larger sterile type, with globular flower heads. There is some confusion, as there are a few other plants, including other members of the genus Viburnum, also referred to as \\"snowball bush\\". The shrub is also cultivated as a component of hedgerows, cover plantings, and as part of other naturalistic plantings in its native regions. It is naturalised in North America, where it is called \\"European cranberrybush\\" (although it is not a cranberry). The cultivars 'Notcutt‚Äôs Variety', 'Roseum' and 'Xanthocarpum' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Uses= The fruit is edible in small quantities, with a very acidic taste; it can be used to make jelly. It is however mildly toxic, and may cause vomiting or diarrhea if eaten in large amounts. The term cramp bark is related to the properties of the bark's ability to reduce smooth muscle tightness. It is called cramp bark as relieving this type of muscle tightness is most often associated with relieving women's menstrual (period) cramps. However, this can also be used during pregnancy for cramps or pain and general muscle cramping. Cultural meaning Eastern Slavic cultures viburnum opulus or kalyna often represents the beauty of a young lady. Mentions of the viburnum can be found throughout Ukrainian folklore such as songs, decorative art, Ukrainian embroidery, and poetry. Its symbolic roots can be traced to the Slavic paganism of millennia ago. According to a legend, kalyna was associated with the birth of the Universe, the so-called Fire Trinity: the Sun, the Moon, and the Star.Lady of Prykarpattia Ukrainian embroidery Its berries symbolize one's home and native land, blood, and family roots. Kalyna is often depicted on Ukrainian embroidery: ritual cloths and shirts. In Slavic paganism kalyna also represents the beauty of a young lady, which rhymes well in the Ukrainian language: ka-ly-na ‚Äî div-chy-na.Doctor Bozhko, Agrarian Sciences. Trees in culture by folk. Doctor Kuzmenko, Philological Sciences. The symbolics of guilder rose in Ukrainian songs of the 20th century national liberating movements. The song Chervona Kalyna was the anthem of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, and a berry cluster is today an insignia of the Ukrainian Army. Viburnum opulus (kalina) is also one of the national symbols of Russia.Peacebuilding with Women in Ukraine: Using Narrative to Envision a Common Future by Maureen Flaherty, Lexington Books, 2012, (page 172) In Russia the Viburnum fruit is called kalina (–∫–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞) and is considered a national symbol. Kalina derived in Russian language from kalit' or raskalyat', which means \\"to make red-hot\\". The red fiery color of the berries represents beauty in Russian culture and together with sweet raspberries it symbolises the passionate love of a beautiful maiden, since berries were always an erotic symbol in Russia. The bitter side of the red fruit also symbolizes love separation in Russian folk culture. The name of the Russian song Kalinka is a diminutive of Kalina. Viburnum opulus is also an important symbol of the Russian national ornamental wood painting handicraft style called Khokhloma. In Romanian, which has been influenced by East Slavic culture, Viburnum opulus is called cƒÉlin. CƒÉlin is also used as both a given name and a surname.

The making of the \\"Rape of Nanking\\". 2006, page 64 Since that time, the historicity of the event has been hotly contested, often by Japanese nationalists or negationist historians who seek to invalidate the historiography of the Nanjing Massacre.Fogel, Joshua A. The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography. 2000, page 82 The issue first emerged from a series of wartime Japanese newspaper articles, which celebrated the \\"heroic\\" killing of the Chinese by two Japanese officers, who were engaged in a competition to see who could kill the most first. The issue was revived in the 1970s, which sparked a larger controversy over Japanese war crimes in China, in particular, the Nanjing Massacre. The original accounts printed in the newspaper described the killings as hand-to-hand combat; however, historians have suggested that they were most likely another part of the widespread mass killings of defenceless Chinese prisoners. Wartime accounts The December 13, 1937 article in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun's Contest to kill 100 people using a sword series. Mukai (left) and Noda (right). The bold headline reads, 'Incredible Record' - Mukai 106 ‚Äì 105 Noda‚ÄîBoth 2nd Lieutenants Go Into Extra Innings\\" In 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and its sister newspaper, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun covered a contest between two Japanese officers, and , in which the two men were described as vying with one another to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword. The competition supposedly took place en route to Nanking, prior to the infamous Nanking Massacre, and was covered in four articles from November 30, 1937, to December 13, 1937; the last two being translated in the Japan Advertiser. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it difficult to determine which officer had actually won the contest. Therefore (according to the journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun of December 13), they decided to begin another contest with the goal of 150 kills.. The Nichi Nichi headline of the story of December 13 read Incredible Record' [in the Contest to] Behead 100 People‚ÄîMukai 106 ‚Äì 105 Noda‚ÄîBoth 2nd Lieutenants Go Into Extra Innings\\". Other soldiers and historians have noted the unlikelihood of the lieutenants' alleged heroics, which entailed killing enemy after enemy in fierce hand-to- hand combat. Noda himself, on returning to his hometown, admitted this during a speech. > \\"Actually, I didn't kill more than four or five people in hand-to-hand > combat ... We'd face an enemy trench that we'd captured, and when we called > out, \\"Ni, Lai-Lai!\\" (You, come here!), the Chinese soldiers were so stupid, > they'd rush toward us all at once. Then we'd line them up and cut them down, > from one end of the line to the other. I was praised for having killed a > hundred people, but actually, almost all of them were killed in this way. > The two of us did have a contest, but afterwards. I was often asked whether > it was a big deal, and I said it was no big deal ...\\" Trial and execution After the war, a written record of the contest found its way into the documents of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Soon after, the two soldiers were extradited to China, tried by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal, convicted of atrocities committed during the Battle of Nanking, and the subsequent massacre. On January 28th, 1948, both soldiers were executed at the Yuhuatai execution chamber by the Chinese government. Postwar accounts In Japan, the contest was lost to the obscurity of history until 1967, when Tomio Hora (a professor of history at Waseda University) published a 118-page document pertaining to the events of Nanking. The story was unreported by the Japanese press until 1971, when Japanese journalist Katsuichi Honda brought the issue to the attention of the public with a series of articles written for Asahi Shimbun, which focused on interviews with Chinese survivors of the World War II occupation and massacres. In Japan, the articles sparked fierce debate about the Nanking Massacre, with the veracity of the killing contest a particularly contentious point of debate.Fogel, Joshua A. The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography. 2000, page 81-2 Over the following years, many authors have argued over whether the Nanking Massacre even occurred, with viewpoints on the subject also being a predictor for whether they believed the contest was a fabrication. The Sankei Shimbun and Japanese politician Tomomi Inada have publicly demanded that the Asahi and Mainichi media companies retract their wartime reporting of the contest.Schreiber, Mark, \\"U.S. sea patrols fuel war of words in print \\", Japan Times, 1 November 2015, p. 18 In a later work, Katsuichi Honda placed the account of the killing contest into the context of its effect on Imperial Japanese forces in China. In one instance, Honda notes Japanese veteran Shintaro Uno's autobiographical description of the effect on his sword after consecutively beheading nine prisoners. Uno compares his experiences with those of the two lieutenants from the killing contest. Although he had believed the inspirational tales of hand-to-hand combat in his youth, after his own experience in the war he came to believe the killings were more likely executions. Shintaro adds, > \\"Whatever you say, it's silly to argue about whether it happened this way or > that way when the situation is clear. There were hundreds and thousands of > soldiers like Mukai and Noda, including me, during those fifty years of war > between Japan and China. At any rate, it was nothing more than a commonplace > occurrence during the so-called Chinese Disturbance.\\"Katsuichi Honda, ed. > Frank Gibney. The Nanjing massacre: a Japanese journalist confronts Japan's > national shame. 1999, page 128-132, M.E. Sharpe, In 2000, Bob Wakabayashi wrote that \\"the killing contest itself was a fabrication\\", but the controversy it created \\"Increased the Japanese people's knowledge of the atrocity and raised their awareness of being victimizers in a war of imperialist aggression despite efforts to the contrary by conservative revisionists.\\". Joshua Fogel has stated that to accept the newspaper account \\"as true and accurate requires a leap of faith that no balanced historian can make.\\"Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, The Nanking Atrocity 1937-1938 (Berghahn Books, 2007), pp. 280 The Nanking Massacre Memorial in China includes a display on the contest among its many exhibits. A Japan Times article has suggested that its presence allows revisionists to \\"sow seeds of doubt\\" about the accuracy of the entire collection.. One of the swords allegedly used in the contest is on display at the Republic of China Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan. The contest is depicted in the 1994 film Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre, as well as the 2009 film, John Rabe. Lawsuit In April 2003, the families of Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda filed a defamation suit against Katsuichi Honda, Kashiwa Shob≈ç, the Asahi Shimbun, and the Mainichi Shimbun, requesting ¬•36,000,000 in compensation. On 23 August 2005, Tokyo District Court Judge Akio Doi dismissed the suit on the grounds that \\"The contest did occur, and was not fabricated by the media\\". The judge stated that, although the original newspaper article included \\"False elements\\", the officers admitted that they had raced to kill 100 people and \\"It is difficult to say it was fiction.\\" Some evidence of killing Chinese POWs (not hand-to-hand fighting) were shown by the defendants, and the court admitted the possibilities of killing POWs by sword.

History The Chidlow townsite was originally known variously as Chidlow's Flat, Chidlow's Springs or Chidlow's Well after a well and stockyard on the old Mahogany Creek to Northam road. The well was sunk by William Chidlow, a pioneer of the Northam district, who originally established the Northam road. Chidlow arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1831. Settlement began in 1883 when it became known that Chidlow's Well was to be the terminus of the second section of the Eastern Railway, which was opened in March 1884. Chidlow's Well railway station and townsite were renamed Chidlow in 1920. The railway station and yard were of significance in the operation of the Eastern Railway from the 1880s to the 1960s. Lake Leschenaultia was originally constructed to provide water for the steam trains. Various proposals have been put forward to rebuild the railway to Midland especially due to the restricted nature of public transport to the Chidlow area. Nowadays, the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail retraces the 70 kilometres of the old Eastern Railway which was constructed from Fremantle to York in the 1880s. Military history During World War II Chidlow was the location of a significant Army camp on the Old Northam Road near Haigh and Forge Roads. Erection of camp buildings at Chidlow was completed in March 1943. Designated a brigade camp with three battalions, Chidlow's Army Camp was constructed to accommodate up to 1,000 troops in some 15 camp areas.McKenzie- Smith, G (1994), The ebb and flow of the Australian Army in Western Australia, 1941 to 1945, Grimwade Publications, Attractions Since the closure of the railway the Chidlow community has adjusted from being an important transport location to more of a rural retreat location. The Railway Reserve Heritage Trail has become one of the major recreational facilities in the Shire of Mundaring, and is suitable for walking, cycling and horse riding. The Chidlow Tavern sits opposite the park where the Chidlow's Wells Station once stood. Lake Leschenaultia is popular with both locals and visitors and provides safe swimming, canoe hire, walking trails and camping.

Biography Marvuglia received his first training in his native Palermo. This was followed by a stay in Rome from 1747 to 1759. By the end of his time there, a handful of progressive young architects and designers in the circuit of the French Academy in Rome were moving away from the ornate Baroque towards a simpler, more classical form of architecture under the influence of the antiquarian and architect Winckelmann, a prot√©g√© of Cardinal Alessandro Albani. Marvuglia's design of a town square won the second prize in a contest organised by the Accademia San Luca. His entry had, at its centre, a circular domed building reminiscent of the Pantheon in Rome, but with Baroque features in its columns and statuary. Following his return to Sicily, he worked on the rebuilding of the monastery of San Martino delle Scale, in the mountains near Palermo; however, while Marvuglia's basic design was Baroque in style, the straight clean lines in the plan, as opposed to the curved facades and broken rooflines of typical Sicilian Baroque, are evidence that the tide of fashion was flowing towards Neoclassicism. Though much of Marvuglia's work was in municipal architecture, two churches are credited to him. One, at the very start of his independent career, is San Filippo Neri (1769), rather than in high Baroque, it is built with a facade divided into three square divisions decorated with panels of bas-relief. The pilasters are flat and plain. The pediments are unbroken. The interior of the church has a gilded barrel vaulted ceiling, supported by great marble columns. What is unusual in the Sicilian Baroque tradition here is that the columns do not support an arcade, but a flat entablature. This church, which 18th-century English visitors much preferred to the ornate Sicilian Baroque, clearly shows the emerging migration from Baroque decoration towards a more sober order. In his design for the church of San Francesco di Sales, located in Corso Calatafimi of Palermo (1772‚Äì76, consecrated 8 May 1818), Marvuglia interpreted a classicizing Palladian program of paired pilasters in the piers of an abbreviated arcade giving onto two pairs of side chapels, supporting an uninterrupted cornice carried entirely round the space, integrating the sober pedimented tabernacle of the high altar, all in a restrained tonality of white and cream that to an early viewer was \\"semplice e senza ornamenti\\" (\\"simple and without ornaments\\") as indeed it was in the context of Late Baroque Palermo. As an architect, Marvuglia showed great understanding of proportion and mass. His Palazzo Constantino, a project he took over in 1787, shows a fusion of both the Neoclassical and Palladian. He had the palace decorated by Giuseppe Velasquez. His Palazzo Belmonte Riso (completed in 1784) clearly shows better than any other in Sicily the final days of Sicilian Baroque as it was transformed into Neoclassicism; the unbroken skyline and the plain almost severe pillars and unbroken window pediments, far outweigh the Baroque sentiments in internal arcaded courtyard. Marvuglia designed two villas at the newly fashionable aristocratic enclave of Bagheria. The Villa Villarosa, while neoclassical in spirit is clearly influenced by the h√¥tels by Gabriel on the Place Louis XV in Paris. For Ferdinand I of Naples, forced into temporary residence in Sicily by the republican revolution and the Napoleonic occupation, he designed a whimsical Casina Cinese in the royal park of La Favorita outside Palermo and at Ficuzza a long unbroken block of a severely classical villa with very little relief and an unbroken cornice. As a teacher of architecture Marvuglia strongly supported the study of Sicily's Greek temples, however, in spite of his later reputation as a Neoclassical architect he never applied to his own work the strict rules and proportions he found in his studies of ancient Greek architecture. He died in Palermo in 1814.

Retrieved December 15, 2009. History =Formation= MUFG Bank is the product of three bank mergers that occurred between 1996 and 2006. Mitsubishi Bank was founded in 1880 by a former samurai, Iwasaki Yatar≈ç, and was a core member of the Mitsubishi Group of companies. It merged with The Bank of Tokyo in 1996 to form , which at that point was the world's largest bank in terms of total assets. In 1998, upon merger of the then second and third largest Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, the newly created UBS AG became the second largest in the world at the time, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.2 of the Big 3 Swiss Banks To Join to Seek Global Heft . The New York Times, December 9, 1997 The Bank of Tokyo had historically focused on foreign exchange business since its foundation as the Yokohama Specie Bank in 1880, while Mitsubishi had had a stronger focus on domestic corporate and retail banking. Both banks were relatively healthy in the wake of the Japanese asset price bubble. Until the Tokyo-Mitsubishi merger took place in 1996, Sanwa Bank, which was based in Osaka and was the anchor of the Sanwa Group keiretsu, had been considered the strongest bank in Japan, and it had aimed to be the world's largest bank during the \\"bubble era\\". By 2000, however, Sanwa was the fourth largest bank in Japan. It entered into merger talks with two other large banks, Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank, to create the world's third- largest bank by assets. Asahi (now part of Resona Holdings) pulled out of these talks later that year. By 2001, The Toyo Trust & Banking Co. had been added to the merger group and the combined company was to be called United Financial Holdings of Japan. The merger was completed in 2002 and the new bank was officially named . UFJ was headquartered in Nagoya, the historical headquarters of Tokai Bank. During its short life, it was plagued by bad debt problems and by infighting between the employees of its predecessor companies. The holding companies of BTM and UFJ agreed to merge in 2005, forming Japan's largest bank by assets and market capitalization. This led to litigation between BTM and Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which had previously agreed to an alliance with UFJ under which it would take over UFJ's trust banking operations. BTM and UFJ settled their dispute for 2.5 billion yen in late 2006. The merger of the two bank holding companies was completed on October 1, 2005, creating the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The core banking units of MTFG and UFJ Holdings, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. and UFJ Bank Ltd., respectively, continued to operate separately until January 1, 2006, when the two units combined to form The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU) =Post-merger operations= Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank of Tokyo each had significant banking subsidiaries in California (Bank of California and Union Bank respectively) before their merger. At the time of the merger, these U.S. banks also merged to form UnionBanCal Corporation. BTM listed UnionBanCal on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999. In 2008, BTMU purchased all of the outstanding shares of UnionBanCal. BTMU moved its New York-based banking operations to Union Bank and renamed the company MUFG Union Bank in 2014. BTMU was investigated by New York banking regulators over its role in routing payments for Iranian customers through its New York branch in violation of U.S. sanctions. BTMU settled with the state for $250 million in 2013. A second settlement was reached for $315 million in 2014 after it was found that PricewaterhouseCoopers had altered an investigation report on the issue; PwC itself was fined $25 million in relation to the matter. On April 1, 2018, the bank was renamed to . This name change aligned the bank name with the holding company name, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), removing \\"Tokyo\\" from the name.

It allowed users to download all of their mail and messages, read and edit them offline, and then upload any replies. This reduced the amount of time they spent on line. The name \\"Blue Wave\\" originally referred to the client software, but as new clients were written that supported the same file format, the name came to refer primarily to the format itself. History Blue Wave developed after Fred Rappuhn and George Hatchew met at a picnic arranged for local area sysops. The two developed the concept at the picnic and started development immediately. Rappuhn concentrated on the offline reader, while Hatchew concentrated on the BBS door program that would convert the BBS message system to a Blue Wave format. The first version was released to the public 20 September 1990, marketed via their company, Blue Wave Software. Doors for most PC BBS systems were made available over time. Another offline mail packet format called QWK was created in 1987, but only ran on the commercial PCBoard system. It remained less widely used than Blue Wave until new QWK doors appeared covering many of the same BBS systems. The Blue Wave client software was then adapted to allow it to read and write QWK as well as Blue Wave files. Rappuhn was hired as a programmer by Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in September 1991 and was unable to continue development for Blue Wave Software. Blue Wave Software dissolved and Hatchew started Cutting Edge Computing to continue development. Hatchew was later involved in a serious car accident, and was unable to continue development of the system past 1993. Description Like QWK, Blue Wave message files consisted of a selection of seemingly randomly named files. Messages themselves were stored in the main \`.DAT\` file, supported by an information file and a file containing the headers for each message, and a pointer to the body in the DAT. The Blue Wave packet format has also been supported by other offline mail readers such as BlueMail, MultiMail, and Wolverine. A tool called bwave2mbox is also available to convert Blue Wave packets to mbox files. Y2K The Y2K date problem hit Blue Wave, like so many other programs. The Blue Wave Reader that the end users use to read their mail exhibited the problem by the addition of a numerical digit leading the TO: name in the header. The Blue Wave Door on the BBS' exhibited the problem by creating three digit years where there should have been a two digit year. Several fixes not directly related to Blue Wave were created but they worked on the actual messages after they had been imported into the local message bases. In October 1999, Dale Shipp created a fix called BWREPFIX that corrects the problem on the users end. This solution uses a batch file in the archiver section rather than calling the archiver directly. In the batch file, the outbound message dates are fixed and then the batch file calls the archiver which then packs the messages for transmitting to the BBS. Another Y2K fix was created and released in October 2005. This fix is a patch to the binary date library provided by the Borland International C++ libraries that the Blue Wave Door and Reader programs are compiled with. This fix is considered to be a cleaner solution to the problem because the actual library is repaired internally which means that this method doesn't require any external tools to perform the fixing of the dates.

He also admired formal linguistic approaches to cognition, and explored the possibility of formulating a formal grammar to capture the structure of stories. Biography Rumelhart was born in Mitchell, South Dakota on June 12, 1942. His parents were Everett Leroy and Thelma Theora (Ballard) Rumelhart. He began his college education at the University of South Dakota, receiving a B.A. in psychology and mathematics in 1963. He studied mathematical psychology at Stanford University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1967. From 1967 to 1987 he served on the faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. In 1987 he moved to Stanford University, serving as Professor there until 1998. Rumelhart was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1991 and received many prizes, including a MacArthur Fellowship in July 1987, the Warren Medal of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, and the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award. Rumelhart, co-recipient with James McClelland, won the 2002 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Psychology. Rumelhart became disabled by Pick's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and at the end of his life lived with his brother in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He died in Chelsea, Michigan. He is survived by two sons. Work Rumelhart was the first author of a highly cited paper from 1986 (co-authored by Geoffrey Hinton and Ronald J. Williams) that applied the back-propagation algorithm (also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa in 1970) to multi-layer neural networks. This work showed through experiments that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data. The approach has been widely used for basic cognition researches (e.g., memory, visual recognition) and practical applications. This paper, however, does not cite earlier work of the backpropagation method, such as the 1974 dissertation of Paul Werbos. In the same year, Rumelhart also published Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition with James McClelland, which described their creation of computer simulations of perceptron, giving to computer scientists their first testable models of neural processing, and which is now regarded as a central text in the field of cognitive science. Rumelhart's models of semantic cognition and specific knowledge in a diversity of learned domains using initially non-hierarchical neuron-like processing units continue to interest scientists in the fields of artificial intelligence, anthropology, information science, and decision science. In his honor, in 2000 the Robert J. Glushko and Pamela Samuelson Foundation created the David E. Rumelhart Prize for Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Rumelhart as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth. References External links * David E.

QWK was originally developed by Mark \\"Sparky\\" Herring in 1987 for systems running the popular PCBoard bulletin board system, but it was later adapted for other platforms. During the height of bulletin board system popularity, several dozen offline mail readers supported the QWK format. Description Like other offline readers, QWK gathered up messages for a particular user using BBS-side QWK software, compressed them using an application such as PKZIP, and then transferred them to the user. This is usually accomplished via a \\"BBS door\\" program running on the BBS system. In the case of QWK, the messages were placed in a single large file that was then bundled with several control files and then compressed into a single archive with the file extension, and typically the BBS's \\"id\\" name as the base filename in the form . The file was normally sent to the user automatically using the self-starting feature of the ZModem protocol, although most QWK doors allowed a choice of other protocols. Once the resulting file has been received by the user, the steps are reversed to extract the files from the archive and then open them in a client-side reader. Again, these individual steps are typically automated to a degree, meaning that the user simply has to invoke the door software on the BBS, wait for the download to complete, and then run the client. The various intermediary steps are automated. QWK originally did not include any functionality for uploading replies, but this was quickly addressed as QWK became more popular. QWK placed replies in a file (again, typically with the BBS's \\"id\\" as the name) that was exchanged automatically the next time the user called in. QWK clients varied widely in functionality, but all of them offered basic e-mail and public forum support. Prior to the introduction of QWK and similar systems, it was not uncommon for users with large message volumes to set up their own FidoNet node to quickly gather their mail, but QWK dramatically reduced the required setup, and greatly increased the number of users of offline mail. Architecture As QWK was originally designed to work with PCBoard, the system bears many marks of PCBoard's layout for message and forum files. For instance, QWK uses one file to contain the messages, and another that is used to index their headers. QWK was essentially a way to collect messages from PCBoard's internal files and re-package them into a single file. QWK was later modified to include extended fields that broke out of the original PCBoard limitations. The new format, known as Extended QWK but written as QWKE (pronounced quick-ee), added a series of kludge lines outside the header line of the message that allowed free-form text. For instance, if the SUBJECT header was longer than 25 characters, it was clipped to 25 characters in the header and then repeated in complete form in the message body. QWKE-aware reader software would notice the kludge fields and place them in the header display; non-aware software simply left the text in the body. More minor changes included small information packets travelling between the BBS and user.Peter Rocca, QWKE Specifications 1.02, 1997 See also *Blue Wave, another offline format very similar to QWK *SOUP, essentially the same idea as QWK but supporting UseNet rather than BBS systems *ZipNews,What is ZipNews? used on BBS systems, but most similar to SOUP References  External links  Email Bulletin board systems Offline mail readers ","title":"QWK (file format)"},{"id":"2823131","text":"Fran√ßois Xavier Bon de Saint-Hilaire c.1713 by Jean Ranc Fran√ßois Xavier Bon de Saint Hilaire (1678‚Äì1761), president of the Court of Auditors of Montpellier, demonstrated in 1709 that he could make fabric from spider silk.

A 3-manifold which has such a finite cover is said to virtually fiber. If M is a Seifert fiber space, then M virtually fibers if and only if the rational Euler number of the Seifert fibration or the (orbifold) Euler characteristic of the base space is zero. The hypotheses of the conjecture are satisfied by hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In fact, given that the geometrization conjecture is now settled, the only case needed to be proven for the virtually fibered conjecture is that of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The original interest in the virtually fibered conjecture (as well as its weaker cousins, such as the virtually Haken conjecture) stemmed from the fact that any of these conjectures, combined with Thurston's hyperbolization theorem, would imply the geometrization conjecture. However, in practice all known attacks on the \\"virtual\\" conjecture take geometrization as a hypothesis, and rely on the geometric and group-theoretic properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The virtually fibered conjecture was not actually conjectured by Thurston. Rather, he posed it as a question and has stated that it was intended as a challenge and not meant to indicate he believed it, although he wrote that \\"[t]his dubious-sounding question seems to have a definite chance for a positive answer\\". The conjecture was finally settled in the affirmative in a series of papers from 2009 to 2012. In a posting on the ArXiv on 25 Aug 2009, Daniel Wise implicitly implied (by referring to a then-unpublished longer manuscript) that he had proven the conjecture for the case where the 3-manifold is closed, hyperbolic, and Haken. This was followed by a survey article in Electronic Research Announcements in Mathematical Sciences. have followed, including the aforementioned longer manuscript by Wise. In March 2012, during a conference at Institut Henri Poincar√© in Paris, Ian Agol announced he could prove the virtually Haken conjecture for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds . Taken together with Daniel Wise's results, this implies the virtually fibered conjecture for all closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Notes References * *D.

They are generally carved out of a hillside or excavated horizontally from a central \\"sunken courtyard\\". The earth that surrounds the indoor space serves as an effective insulator keeping the inside of the structure warm in cold seasons and cool in hot seasons. Consequently, very little heating is required in winter, and in summer, it is as cool as an air-conditioned room. The history of yaodongs goes back centuries, and they continue to be used. In 2006, an estimated 40 million people in northern China lived in yaodongs.Lloyd, J & Mitchinson, J: \\"The Book of General Ignorance\\". Faber & Faber, 2006. In the last decade, yaodongs have been brought to the attention of scientists and researchers. These traditional dwellings have been regarded as an example of sustainable design.  Types  Cave dwelling ‚Äì courtyard The landscape of the Loess Plateau terrain is very complicated with valleys, slopes, ridges, and monticules. In order to avoid the wind and utilize sunlight and water, most yaodongs are distributed along the sides of the cliffs and valleys to conform to the terrain, in principle, forming three types of Yaodong. * Cliffside Yaodong () Cliffside yaodongs are the most common among all types. People dig caves in the cliff on the edge of the loess slopes with the floor rectangular and the top arched. In front of the cave is an open space for lighting and ventilation, so that the user does not feel the space to be depressive. According to the number of cave holes, the yaodongs can be further classified into three-hole type, two-hole type, and single hole type. A typical example is the city of Yan'an. * Sunken Yaodong () Those dug around an excavation conducted at the surface, serving as interior courtyard, called yaodong-well or sunken courtyard (photo cons). In the Loess Plateau, without hillsides and ravines available, peasants skillfully use loess's features (wall stability) to dig a square pit on the spot and then dig the cave horizontally on the four walls to form the underground courtyard. In most parts of western Henan, this form of caves is called the \\"pit yard‚Äù. Sunken yaodong has two types according to the form of entrance: slope-entrance and flat-entrance. Both are excavations of pits in the flat ground. First, if the yaodong is surrounded by flat ground, slope can be used for entering and leaving the pits. This is called the ‚Äúdikenyuan‚Äù or the ‚Äú pit yard‚Äù. Second, if there is a cliff or a steep slope next to the yaodong, it can be used to excavate the corridor through the cliff or slope to reach the horizontal entrance of the courtyard. This type of Sunken yaodong, which is also called the well-courtyard or the well-yaodong, is the majority in the area. * Hoop Yaodong () The Hoop yaogong, also called independent yaodong, is the most valuable type considering its construction techniques. In the traditional residential areas in western Henan, the Hoop Yaogongs appear in the places where there are no condition for excavations of cave dwellings, such as the loess layer is thin, the slopes are gentle, the height of the soil cliffs is insufficient, or the bedrock is exposed. A hoop yaodong is usually built wholly or partially outdoors, with an arched structure inspired by the underground dwellings. This arch-shaped form, not only reflects the Chinese traditional thinking of a Round sky and Square earth, more importantly, the high arch of the cave plus high windows allows the sun to further penetrate inside the cave in winter, therefore making full use of solar radiation. This new vaulted homes of this type are now common among farmers in the area.  Origins  The first type of yaodong were underground dwellings that date back to the 2nd millennium BC, China's Bronze Age, and according to Chinese tradition, the Xia Dynasty. Chinese scholars generally believe that this type of habitat has developed mainly from the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD), along with a progressive improvement of construction techniques to the dynasties Sui (581 to 618) and Tang (618 to 907). But it is during the dynasties Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) that the pace of construction reached its peak.  Geographic distribution  The Loess Plateau in northern China (hatched area) and the valley of the Yellow River The yaodong homes are common on the Loess Plateau of China in the North and are found mainly in four provinces: Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, and the Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia. In the Qingyang region especially, the ratio of cave dwellers to non-cave dwellers is the highest found anywhere in China. The death toll of approximately 810,000 from the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake was in part because it was centered on the Loess Plateau, and collapsed many yaodongs.  Construction  More elaborate yaodongs may have a fa√ßade built with stones with fine patterns carved on the surface. Yaodongs can also be constructed with stones or bricks as stand-alone structures. The inside walls are usually plastered with lime to make them white. The construction processes of different types of yaodong are slightly different. # For the cliffside yaodong, the main structure of it is the soil wall, and the interior is reinforced with wooden piles. In addition, the beams and columns bear the load, forming a structure that guarantee the cave will not collapse. The common method of this construction process is to use rock as wall base and the clay as the top tile. In order to reinforce the cave and reduce costs, the wall is made of clay inside and stones outside. # Building a hoop yaodong needs wood frame mold for building construction. Because the wood mold can be reused and the wood consumed is limited, the overall cost can be lower than that of most housing. Moreover, because its space volume is 1/3 smaller than that of a regular house, the hoop yaodong has a strong advantage in energy conservation. #* The first step in the construction of a hoop yaodong is to dig the foundation after determining the orientation. Then, the entrance position and the height and thickness of the wall is determined based on the orientation. A hoop yaodong usually has three or five caves. #* The second step is to excavate the cave. Because a hoop yaodong is built on the flat ground, the excavation only uses the existing brick wall to make the arch structure, forming the basic spatial form of each cave. The yaodong is covered with at least two meters of soil mud to ensure the thermal insulation of the cave. Based on the main body of the yaodong, the top of the cave should be covered with a normal house and capped. #* The third step is to build the fence and install doors.  Notable examples  Cave city in Yan'an, Shaanxi, Mao Zedong's headquarters from 1935 to 1948 The most famous yaodongs in China are perhaps those in Yan'an. The communists led by Mao Zedong headquartered there in 1935‚Äì1948 and lived in yaodongs. Edgar Snow visited Mao and his party in Yan'an and wrote Red Star Over China.

New Brunswick Museum, Saint John, N.B. (accession number: 1962.94). John Howe (October 14, 1754 ‚Äì December 27, 1835) was a loyalist printer during the American Revolution, a printer and Postmaster in Halifax, the father of the famous Joseph Howe, a spy prior to the War of 1812, and eventually a Magistrate of the Colony of Nova Scotia. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts Bay colony, the son of Joseph Howe, a tin plate worker of Puritan ancestry, and Rebeccah Hart.Punch, Terrance M. and Marble, Allan E. \\"The Family of John Howe, Loyalist and King's Printer\\" in the Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly, Vol. 6 (September, 1976), p. 317.Grant, John N. \\"John Howe, Senior: Printer, Publisher, Postmaster, Spy,\\" pp.24-57, in Eleven Exiles: Accounts of Loyalists of the American Revolution, Phyllis R. Blakeley and John N. Grant, eds. (Toronto and Charlottetown: Dundurn Press Ltd., 1982).  Early years  John Howe was born October 14th in 1754, the same year that the French and Indian War or Seven Years' War (1754‚Äì1763) began. It was the consequences of this conflict that required the British to demand greater taxes from, and assert greater control over, their American colonies and it was the consequences of this conflict that raised and disappointed the English-American colonists' expectations about their opportunities for expansion, all of which contributed to the colonists' determination to revolt against an increasingly costly, authoritarian, and obstructive British rule. John Howe was eight years old at the end of this war on September 7, 1763, so he grew to maturity influenced by the events that followed, such as colonial resistance to the Stamp Act (1765‚Äì66), when he was 11, and the violence of the Boston Massacre (1770), when he was 16, in which British troops opened fire on a mob of Bostonians who were brawling with the troops. John Howe's family were converts to a religious sect called the Sandemanians, whose best-known member was Michael Faraday, the famous scientist. The sect began when the Rev. John Glas (1695‚Äì1773), who had been the Presbyterian minister at Tealing, Perthshire, Scotland, sought a return to a \\"New Testament Christianity\\" that included Agapƒìs, pacifism, good works, charity, communal property, as well as a strong opposition to state control over the church. These views led to his suspension from the Church of Scotland in 1728. With the help of his son-in-law, Robert Sandeman, the sect grew to several churches in Scotland and England. Sandeman first moved to London in 1760 and then, in 1764, to New England. He arrived in Boston, where he helped his nephew get established as a bookseller, and then moved to Danbury, Connecticut, where he lived until his death in April, 1771.Thomas, Isaiah, The History of Printing In America: with a Biography of Printers & an Account of Newspapers (New York: Weathervane Press, 1970), pp.151, 210, and 290. Sandeman's teachings to live a more purely Christian life appealed to New England's Puritan descendants and, with the rising tensions between the colonists and royal rule, Sandman's command to \\"Fear God and honour the King\\" and \\"if it be possible... live peacefully with all men\\" found a receptive audience amongst the loyalists. A Joseph Howe is listed as a member of the Boston Sandemanians; this was probably John's father, but it might have been John's elder brother.Beck, J. Murray. Joseph Howe, Vol. I, Conservative Reformer, 1804-1848 (Kingston and Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1982), pp.7-8, . John Howe's Sandemanian beliefs likely contributed to his loyalist stance, and definitely contributed to his lifelong pacifism. John Howe probably began his apprenticeship as a printer to Richard Draper in either 1766 or 1767.That John Howe apprenticed under Richard Draper, and that he became a partner almost immediately after he had completed his apprenticeship, is drawn from Grant, John N. (1982), p.27. That his completion of his apprenticeship and his entry into partnership with Margaret Draper occurred in October, 1775, is indicated by the date of the first issue that bears his name, October 13, 1775, and it is consistent with the practice of indenturing apprentices until they reached 21 years of age. The start date is more open to conjecture. Rorabaugh, W. J. (1986), , pp.7-8, indicates that Benjamin Franklin began his printer's apprenticeship in Boston at the age of 12, and Beck, J. Murray. (1982), Vol. I, p. 17, indicates that Joseph Howe, John Howe's youngest son, began his apprenticeship under his father at 13, so a start at 12 or 13 for John Howe would be consistent with the starting ages of an older contemporary and with John Howe's training of his own son. Richard Draper was the King's printer in Massachusetts and the publisher of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, the oldest English newspaper in the Americas. As Richard Draper was known to be a frail and sickly man,Thomas, Isaiah (1970), pp.143-45. and as he was Draper's apprentice, John Howe probably witnessed and wrote the article about the Boston Tea Party that appeared in the December 23, 1773, issue. Less than six months after the report on the Boston Tea Party, Richard Draper, owner of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, died on June 5 or 6, 1774, leaving the paper in the hands of his widow, Margaret Draper. Richard Draper may have anticipated his demise, as he formed a partnership with John Boyle in May, the month before his death. However, Margaret Draper soon ended this partnership (between August 4 and 11, 1774) as Boyle did not share her loyalist sympathies. Margaret Draper published the paper by herself from August 11, 1774.Thomas, Isaiah (1970), pp.175-76.  A Loyalist printer in the American Revolution  On April 19, 1775, the opening battle of the American Revolution occurred when the British forces raided inland from Boston to Concord \\"to destroy a Magazine of Military Stores deposited there.\\" When the raid broke into a firefight, the \\"Troops had above Fifty killed, and many more wounded\\". In the April 20, 1775, issue of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter a short article appeared that briefly described the battle, and‚Äîa day or more later‚Äîa broadside was published that reported on the Battle of Lexington and Concord at greater length. Both were quite likely written and printed by John Howe, who would have been just a few months short of his 21st birthday. After the Battle of Lexington and Concord news of the event quickly spread to the other colonies and American patriots came in great numbers to lay siege to Boston. On June 17, 1775, the American forces seized a hill across the Charles river to the north of Boston in Charlestown and began building fortifications upon it from which they would be able to fire upon the town and harbour. In the morning light, a British ship in the harbour, seeing the fortifications being constructed on the hill, began firing on the hill. Soon, British troops were ferried from Boston to Charlestown, where they charged up and took the hill, although at an enormous cost in lives. John Howe witnessed, wrote, and printed the broadside describing the Battle of Bunker Hill. In later years, he described his experiences at the battle to his youngest son, Joseph, in which he watched as General Sir William Howe led the final bayonet charge up the hill \\"with the bullets flying through the tails of his coat.\\" After the battle, John told of aiding \\"a young officer whose leg had been amputated and who he cured of a raging fever by letting him drink a bucket of cold water.\\" Shortly after the battle, John Howe proposed to Martha Minns, who accepted and became his fianc√©e.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 29. Battle of Lexington and Concord & Siege of Boston map Margaret Draper continued to print the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter until September 7, 1775, when she appears to have had some trouble as no issues were published (or at least no issues have been found) from September 14 to October 6, 1775. John Howe, although he was just completing his apprenticeship, became Margaret Draper's new partner, and he was listed as the publisher from October 13, 1775 (the day before his 21st birthday, the time at which apprenticeships were completed in the practice of the time) to the paper's final issue on February 22, 1776.This is drawn from the mastheads of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter (microfilm), as well as notes in the lists of available issues in library catalogs, such as On March 5, 1776, American forces seized control of Dorchester Heights, a hill to the south of Boston, with a commanding view of Boston harbour. Meanwhile, Henry Knox brought the cannon seized from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston. Realizing that taking the hill would be too costly, and that the Americans would soon have cannon in place, the British decided to evacuate the town of all of their forces and the loyalists. The two sides agreed upon an informal cease-fire proposed and negotiated by those in Boston who were staying: the Americans agreed because they feared the British would set fire to Boston as they left, the British agreed because they didn't want to suffer the costs of evacuating Boston under fire.Ward, Christopher, The War of the Revolution (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1952), vol. 1, pp. 129-30. On March 17, 1776, the last troops and loyalists boarded ships in Boston harbour and set sail for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Margaret Draper, John's partner in the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, is listed as being amongst the loyalists evacuated from Boston to Halifax, and she was accompanied by John Howe. Margaret Draper then moved to England, where she lived on a pension from the British government.Thomas, Isaiah (1970), pp.176. In mid-1776, the British assembled troops on Staten Island. On August 22, they crossed over to Long Island, and on August 27, they engaged and defeated the Americans at the Battle of Long Island. A series of battles continued the New York Campaign, which was concluded with the British victory of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. On November 26, General Clinton and 6,000 troops were sent to take Newport, RI, which they succeeded in doing on December 1. After this victory, the British offered John Howe the position of Printer for the Provincial Forces.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 30. John Howe moved to Newport, RI, along with his fianc√©e, Martha Minns, and her brother, William Minns.That William Minns was also in Newport is drawn from advertisements for things he had for sale in the Newport Gazette (from the microfilm of that paper). He printed the first issue of the Newport Gazette on January 16, 1777, and he continued printing that newspaper until the final issue of October 6, 1779. During their stay in Newport, John Howe married Martha Minns on June 7, 1778. John Howe was named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778, possibly as a result of his work as printer for the British forces in Newport, Rhode Island. During this period, John Howe took on John Ryan, a native of Newport, as his apprentice, who later became the printer of the first newspaper in New Brunswick and then the King's Printer in Newfoundland. Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online: http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=3644. On October 26, 1779, the British evacuated their troops and the loyalists from Newport, RI, to New York. On Christmas Day, 1779, John and Martha Howe's first child, Martha Howe, was born in New York.Punch, Terrance M. and Marble, Allan E. (1976), p. 318. Sometime during 1780, John Howe and his young family, along with his brother-in-law William Minns, quit New York for Halifax, Nova Scotia. John Ryan remained in New York until 1783, becoming a partner with William Lewis in the New-York Mercury and General Advertiser.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online: http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=3644.  Building a life in Halifax  On his return to Halifax, John Howe, published the first issue of the Halifax Journal on December 28, 1780. The paper remained in the Howe family until about 1819 and continued to be printed until about 1870. About half of the Halifax Journal was dedicated to foreign news and essays reprinted from European publications, there was a short Halifax section that covered shipping news and local events, and it reported on issues debated in the Assembly as well as laws and proclamations that were not covered in the Nova Scotia Royal Gazette. John Howe's printing was notable for its quality. The type was carefully composed, the illustrations were well done, and the layout of stories and advertisements changed with each issue rather than filling the same preset layout. This set a superior standard for newspapers in the maritime colonies. In addition to the Halifax Journal, John Howe also did general printing such as pamphlets and sermons, and he printed an annual Almanack. In 1789, he began printing the monthly Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature, Politics, and News. John Howe began to serve as the magazine's editor in July 1790. In 1792, the Nova Scotia Magazine failed due to low subscriptions. Grant, John N. (1976), pp. 32-4. During this period, John Howe's and Martha (Minns) Howe's family grew and suffered losses. On September 2, 1782, their second child, Sarah Howe, was born, but she died at the age of 10 months on June 23, 1783. On September 8, 1784, John Howe, Jr., their third child, was born; in 1786 their fourth child, William Howe, was born; and in 1788, Jane Howe, their fifth child was born. On November 10, 1790, David Howe, John and Martha's sixth child was born, but Martha (Minns) Howe died of complications from the birth on November 25, 1790. On December 25, 1797, John and Martha (Minns) Howe's first child, Martha Howe, married Edward Sentell.Punch, Terrance M. and Marble, Allan E. (1976), p. 318-20. On October 25, 1798, John Howe married his second wife, Mary (Ede) Austen, the widow of Henry Austen. Only a few months later, on January 19, 1799, Martha (Howe) Sentell, the first child of John and Martha (Minns) Howe died in childbirth. But happier events followed with the birth of Sarah Foster Howe in 1800, John Howe's seventh child and his first with Mary (Ede Austen) Howe. On December 4, 1804, his last and best-known child, Joseph Howe, was born.Punch, Terrance M. and Marble, Allan E. (1976), pp. 318 and 322. Meanwhile, after the death of Anthony Henry (printer), John was appointed King's Printer in 1801, responsible for printing the Nova Scotia Royal Gazette and the Debates of the House of Assembly. In the same year, he was also appointed Postmaster of Halifax and \\"agent manager and director of His Majesty's Packet boats in Halifax,\\" a position that was extended to Deputy Postmaster-General of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and the Bermudas in 1803. The postmaster positions included expanding and improving delivery routes and establishing way stations as required.Grant, John N. (1976), pp. 35-6.  John Howe volunteers as a spy  Note other spying claims regarding a John Howe, denied in Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online: http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=3644., \\"Although he was not, as one writer states, the John Howe who acted as a spy for Lieutenant- General Thomas Gage behind the rebel lines in 1775...\\" In 1803, as part of the British blockade of trade with the continent, which was part of the struggle against Napoleon's bid to conquer all of Europe, Britain ignored and violated American sovereignty by searching American ships trading with continental Europe (and therefore Napoleon's regime) and forcefully pressing American sailors into British service. In June, 1807, HMS Leopard fired several shots on when the American ship resisted a search and impressment attempt. Fearing that these events presaged war, Sir George Prevost, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, arranged for a spy to tour the New England states and \\"observe whatever may be agitating.\\" The man he chose for his spy was John Howe.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 39. Howe traveled through the American seaboard states, arriving in Boston on April 22, 1808, under the guise of visiting family and friends. He travelled from Boston to Washington, Norfolk, and New York. He reported on the political situation, predicted that Madison would be the next President, stated that there were French emissaries throughout the country, commented on the anti-British sentiment of the Irish in New York, and assessed the state of military preparedness.Grant, John N. (1976), pp. 39-42. John Howe subsequently made a trip to the United States from November 10, 1808 to January 5, 1809, but this visit was under the more official guise of \\"bearer of Dispatches to the British Minister\\", that minister being David Montagu, Baron Erskine of Restormel Castle, the British Envoy at Washington from 1806 to 1810. This mission included accompanying Baron Erskine to interviews with President Thomas Jefferson and President-elect James Madison. John Howe concluded that war with the United States could be avoided if the British blockade and tariff on ships entering French ports (which was having a devastating effect on the American economy) were rescinded, but if they were not, war was probably unavoidable and attacks on the British North American colonies were likely.Grant, John N. (1976), pp. 42-44. When Madison declared war on Britain, beginning the War of 1812, he cited the British Orders in Council which established the blockade and tariff, just as John Howe had predicted, and attacks on the British North American colonies (later Canada) did occur. For these services, Joseph Howe said ruefully, his father \\"never received a farthing.\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online: http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=3644.  John Howe's later years  John and Mary Howe, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) After his brief stint as a volunteer spy, John returned to his usual work as printer, loyalist writer and postmaster in Halifax. On October 16, 1808, John Howe's eldest son, John Howe, Jr., married Henrietta Hians. In 1810, John Howe was appointed Justice of the Peace and Justice of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. On October 9, 1813, his sixth and youngest child from his first marriage, David Howe, married Elizabeth M. Gethens.Punch, Terrance M. and Marble, Allan E. (1976), p. 322. In 1815, John Howe was given a special commission as Justice \\"for the better and more effective administration of the office of Justice of the Peace and for the establishment of an active, vigorous and effectual Police.\\" John Howe played a role in the establishment of a \\"House of Correction\\" and improving the police in Halifax by having \\"the daily attendance of one Magistrate in some Public Office in Halifax, for managing the Police of the Town.\\"Grant, John N. (1976), pp. 45-6. With his growing duties as a Magistrate and possibly due to a minor stroke, John Howe retired from his offices as King's Printer and Postmaster in 1818, appointments that were then awarded to his son, John Howe, Jr.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 48. As mentioned, John Howe was a religious man and a convert to the Sandemanian church. In Halifax, John served as an elder of the Sandemanian church, he served as a lay preacher to the community of 2000 blacks that fled the United States during the War of 1812 and settled in Halifax, and he made regular Sunday visits to the prison to preach to the inmates. He was a practicing pacifist, yet on at least one occasion he knocked together the heads of two young men who were fighting on the Sabbath.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 47. After his retirement from his offices of King's Printer and Postmaster, John Howe continued to be active, serving as a magistrate. In 1822, Sarah Foster Howe, John's seventh child, married Daniel Langshaw, but in 1824, Sarah Foster (Howe) Langshaw died aboard ship on her way from Liverpool, England, to Lima, Peru, where she was planning to move with her husband. In 1826, John Howe's sixth child, David Howe, also died. But another family event followed on February 2, 1828, when Joseph Howe, John Howe's youngest child, married Catherine Susan Ann McNab.Punch, Terrance M. and Marble, Allan E. (1976), p. 322. After this marriage, John Howe helped to produce his son's, Joseph Howe's, newspaper together with Joseph's wife, particularly when Joseph traveled.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 49. Howe was a serving magistrate when his youngest son, Joseph Howe, was charged with criminal libel for printing an anonymous letter that charged that the police and magistrates had embezzled ¬£30,000 from the people of Halifax. Joseph Howe made it clear that his father was not one of the corrupt magistrates when he argued his own defense. Joseph won an acquittal in the case on March 3, 1835, in a victory that was popularly seen as a triumph of freedom of the press and a blow to the corrupt governance of some of the magistrates. Just over eight months after Joseph won his case, but before Joseph had begun his political career, John Howe died in his sleep on December 27, 1835, at 81 years of age.Grant, John N. (1976), p. 54. He is buried in the Old Burying Ground. See also * C.D. Howe - distant relation to Howe  Notes   References  * Beck, J. Murray.

It is formed by 135 deputies (diputats/deputats/diputados), who are elected every four years or after extraordinary dissolution, chosen by universal suffrage in lists with four constituencies, the Catalan provinces. The Parliament building is located in Ciutadella Park, Barcelona. The most recent parliamentary elections were held on 21 December 2017. Following the 2015 Catalan regional election and the disputed October 1st independence referendum results, the Parliament of Catalonia unilaterally declared independence from Spain on 27 October 2017 with a vote of 70‚Äì10, and purported to form the Catalan Republic. The remaining 55 members abstained or boycotted the vote, disagreeing with the independence movement. In response, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Parliament and called for a snap regional election. History =Catalan Courts= The first representative and legislative bodies in Catalonia were the Peace and Truce of God Assemblies (assemblees de pau i treva), of which the earliest record dates from 1027. These were originally ad hoc, local meetings convened by the clergy (Oliba, Bishop of Vic, who died in 1046, was a notable instigator) but progressively became subsumed into the court of the Counts of Barcelona. The first Catalan legal code, the Usatges de Barcelona, was promulgated by Count Ramon Berenguer I based on the decisions of these assemblies. Although the Counts of Barcelona, had greatly extended the territory under their control, their financial and military power was quite limited, partly because of their former status as vassals of the Carolingian dynasty. Their personal resources were particularly insufficient in periods of economic crisis or military expansion, of which they were many from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. The need to secure troops and revenue led to the steady expansion of the royal court and a formalisation of its procedures. It came to be referred to as the Cort General de Catalunya or Corts catalanes (Catalan Courts), and was endowed with formal procedures, effectively a written constitution, by King Peter III of Aragon in 1283, making this institution the policemaking and legislative body of the Principality of Catalonia. The Corts Catalanes were composed of Three Estates (Tres Bra√ßos), representing the clergy, the feudal nobles and the citizens of Royal towns such as Barcelona or Girona. Inhabitants of feudal towns (such as Cardona) were not represented, except by their overlords. The main function of the Corts was legislative, either in approving laws proposed by the King Peter III of Aragon (Constitucions) or at their own initiative (cap√≠tols de cort). Although the Corts met at irregular intervals, it also formally approved the acts of the between the King and their sessions (known as pragm√†tiques) and, from 1359, established a permanent delegation to oversee the Crown (the Deputation of the General, forerunner of the Generalitat de Catalunya). The Catalan Courts, as well as the use of Catalan as the official language, were abolished by the Nueva Planta decrees in 1716 after the House of Bourbon, supported by the Crown of Castille, defeated the Habsburg pretender to throne, which was backed by the remnants of the Crown of Aragon in the War of the Spanish Succession. =Modern history= There were attempts in the early 20th century to institute an autonomous system of representation for Catalonia. The Commonwealth of Catalonia (1914‚Äì25) was an assembly without legislative powers of the provincial delegations of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona, disbanded and outlawed by Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in 1925. Following an abortive declaration of the Catalan Republic on 14 April 1931, a separate Parliament of Catalonia was established under the first Statute of Autonomy approved by the Parliament of the new Spanish Republic, and was elected on 20 November 1932. This first legislature was controlled by the Republican Left of Catalonia, the winning party of the election, while the conservative Regionalist League, almost hegemonic in Catalonia during the reign of Alfonso XIII, reached the second place but far from the Republican Left.* 1932 Parliament of Catalonia election in Historia Electoral The Parliament approved a large number of progressive legislation in different areas, such as health, culture and civil law, but the institution was suspended between 1934 and 1936 when the Government of Catalonia attempted to create a Catalan State after, among other reasons, a bill to change the taxing of farmers was rejected by the Constitutional Court. The unilateral declaration of independence lasted 10 hours. The Statute of Autonomy was restored in February 1936 after the victory of Popular Front in the Spanish election, and abolished again by Generalissimo Francisco Franco in 1938 during the Spanish Civil War. The Parliament of Catalonia, like the rest of the institutions of the Generalitat, went to exile in 1939. After the death of Franco in 1975 and the Spanish transition to democracy, the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979 recognized the restoration of the Parliament. The first legislature of the current Parliament of Catalonia was elected on 20 March 1980, 48 years after the first election in 1932.

United States debit card holders are guaranteed reversal rights by Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Similar rights extend globally, pursuant to the rules established by the corresponding card association or bank network. A consumer may initiate a chargeback by contacting their issuing bank and filing a substantiated complaint regarding one or more debit items on their statement. The threat of forced reversal of funds provides merchants with an incentive to provide quality products, helpful customer service, and timely refunds as appropriate. Chargebacks also provide a means for reversal of unauthorized transfers due to identity theft. Chargebacks can also occur as a result of friendly fraud, where the transaction was authorized by the consumer but the consumer later attempts to fraudulently reverse the charges. Card association chargeback rules are available online for public inspection and review. They comprise a system for adjudicating transaction disputes between cardholders and merchants, primarily where the issues can be resolved based on documentary evidence incident to the transaction. The rules provide for arbitration of issues by the card association. This may occur where the card issuer generates a second (or \\"arbitration\\") chargeback against the merchant, after receiving the merchant's response to the initial chargeback. Normally this would require the cardholder to rebut elements of the merchant's response. The second chargeback results in a second crediting of the cardholder's account for the disputed funds, after having been credited back to the merchant with its response to the initial chargeback. The merchant's only recourse after the second chargeback is to initiate arbitration of the dispute by the card association. The fee for this is on the order of $250, and the arbitration loser is then obligated to pay the costs of the arbitration.  Reason codes  With each chargeback the issuer selects and submits a numeric reason code. This feedback may help the merchant and acquirer diagnose errors and improve customer satisfaction. Reason codes vary by bank network, but fall in four general categories: * Technical: Expired authorization, non-sufficient funds, or bank processing error. * Clerical: Duplicate billing, incorrect amount billed, or refund never issued. * Quality: Consumer claims to have never received the goods as promised at the time of purchase. * Fraud: Consumer claims they did not authorize the purchase or was a victim of identity theft. One of the most common reasons for a chargeback is a fraudulent transaction. In this case, a credit card is used without the consent or proper authorization of the card holder. In some cases, a merchant is responsible for charges fraudulently imposed on a customer. Fraudulent card transactions often originate with criminals who gain access to secure payment card data and set up schemes to exploit the data. In cases of card not present transactions the merchant is usually responsible for the chargeback and associated fees. After the adoption of EMV (cards with a chip in them), merchants who have not upgraded to EMV technology usually become liable for chargebacks received (unless others in the payment chain have also not upgraded) even in cases where prior to EMV adoption the merchant would not have been liable. Chargebacks can also result from a customer dispute over statement credits. For example, a customer may have returned merchandise to a merchant in return for credit, but credit was never posted to the account. A dispute may also arise if a customer does not receive items they have paid for or if the items were not what they expected. In these examples, the merchant is responsible for issuing credit to its customer, and would be subject to a chargeback. Other types of chargebacks are related to technical problems between the merchant and the issuing bank, for example when a customer was charged twice for a single transaction. Other chargebacks are related to the authorization process of a credit card transaction, for example, if a transaction is declined by its issuing bank but the account is still charged.  Merchant recourse  For transactions where the original invoice was signed by the consumer, the merchant may dispute a chargeback with the assistance of the merchant's acquiring bank. The acquirer and issuer mediate in the dispute process, following rules set forth by the corresponding bank network or card association. If the acquirer prevails in the dispute, the funds are returned to the acquirer, and then to the merchant. Only 21% of chargebacks lodged globally are decided in favour of the merchant. The 2014 Cybersource Fraud Benchmark Report found that only 60% of chargebacks are disputed by merchants, and that merchants have a success rate of about 41% with those they do re-present. To address these more effectively, technology companies have written code and built algorithms that help merchants determine if chargebacks are legitimate or fraudulent.  Merchant penalties  The merchant's acquiring bank accepts the risk that the merchant will remain solvent over time as during chargeback it has to return the funds to the cardholder, and that sum then has to be received back from the merchant, and thus has an incentive to take a keen interest in the merchant's products and business practices. Reducing consumer chargebacks is crucial to this endeavor. To encourage compliance, acquirers may charge merchants a penalty for each chargeback received. Payment service providers, such as PayPal, have a similar policy.PayPal user agreement Section 4.5 lists chargeback info. Section 8 lists chargeback fees. PayPal Merchant charges $20 for each chargeback, when the transaction isn't covered by seller protection (regardless of whether or not it is the first) plus it will retain the original transaction fee.PayPal Merchant Fees - Current Rates for All Merchant Products, retrieved June 2012 In addition, Visa and MasterCard may levy severe penalties against acquiring banks that retain merchants with high chargeback frequency. Acquirers typically pass such fines directly to the merchant. Merchants whose ratios stray too far out of compliance may trigger card association fines of $100 or more per chargeback.  Other types  Accounts may also incur credit reversals in other forms. ATM reversals occur when an ATM deposit envelope is found to have fewer funds than represented by the depositor. A chargeback is made to correct the error. This could result due to a counting error or intentional fraud by the account holder, or the envelope or its contents could have been lost or stolen. Chargebacks also occur when a bank error credits an account with more funds than intended. The bank makes a chargeback to correct the error. If an overdraft results and it cannot be covered in time, the bank could sue or press criminal charges. When a direct deposit is made to the wrong account holder or in a greater amount than intended a chargeback is made to correct the error. Finally, chargebacks occur when an account holder deposits a check or money order and the deposited item is returned due to non- sufficient funds, a closed account, or being discovered to be counterfeit, stolen, altered, or forged. Banks may sue account holders or press criminal charges when chargebacks are required due to fraudulent activity and insufficient funds are in the account to cover the chargebacks.  Negative database  Merchants sometimes maintain a record of customers who chargeback regularly, in a \\"negative database\\".https://www.merchantconnect.com/CWRWeb/pdf/Avoiding_Chargebacks.pdf  See also  * Card security code * Chargeback insurance  References  Merchant services nl:Storno zh:ÈÄÄÂçïÊãí‰ªò ","title":"Chargeback"},{"id":"2823221","text":"Cen Changqian (; died November 7, 691ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ), briefly known as Wu Changqian (Ê≠¶Èï∑ÂÄ©) during the reign of Wu Zetian, formally the Duke of Deng (ÈÑßÂÖ¨), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, serving as chancellor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong That dominated by Empress Wu, as well as Wu Zetian's reign and her earlier regency over her sons Emperor Zhongzong and Emperor Ruizong. In 691, he offended Wu Zetian by opposing the movement to declare her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince (thus displacing the former Emperor Ruizong, whom she demoted to crown prince status in 690 after taking the throne herself), and he, along with his fellow chancellors Ge Fuyuan and Ouyang Tong, were accused of treason and executed.  Background  It is not known when Cen Changqian was born. His father was Cen Wenshu (Â≤ëÊñáÂèî), an older brother of Cen Wenben, who served as chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang. Cen Wenshu died early, so Cen Wenben raised Cen Changqian as his own son.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  As of 682, late in the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Cen Changqian was serving as the deputy minister of defense, when he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto.  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  Emperor Gaozong died in 683, and while his son Li Zhe succeeded him (as Emperor Zhongzong), his very powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) took over all power as regent and empress dowager. In spring 684, when Emperor Zhongzong displayed signs of independence, Empress Dowager Wu by official order deposed him and replaced him with his younger brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). However, Empress Dowager Wu held onto power even more firmly thereafter. in 686, Cen, who was by that point minister of defense, was made Neishi (ÂÖßÂè≤) -- the head of the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Feng Ge) and a post considered one for a chancellor; he also continued to serve as minister of defense. In 688, when Emperor Gaozong's brother Li Zhen, the Prince of Yue, and Li Zhen's son Li Chong (ÊùéÊ≤ñ), the Prince of Langye, suspecting that Empress Dowager Wu was set on seizing the throne herself, rose in rebellion, Cen was one of the generals that Empress Dowager Wu sent against Li Zhen. Li Zhen was quickly defeated, and it is not clear whether Cen participated in Li Zhen's defeat. In 690, Cen was made Wenchang Youxiang (ÊñáÊòåÂè≥Áõ∏), one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai), and also carried the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ), signifying that he was still a chancellor.  During Wu Zetian's reign  Later in 690, Empress Dowager Wu took the throne herself (and was thereafter known as Wu Zetian) and took the title of \\"emperor,\\" demoting Emperor Ruizong to be crown prince, but with the unusual title of Huang Si (ÁöáÂó£) rather than the usual title of Huang Taizi (ÁöáÂ§™Â≠ê), and she changed the name of the state from Tang to Zhou (Âë®). She encouraged people to submit signs of fortune and of Zhou's rise, and it was said that Cen Changqian, apprehensive of his situation, submitted a proposal to have Crown Prince Dan's surname changed from Li to Wu, which Wu Zetian accepted. To reward Cen, she created him the Duke of Deng, and further bestowed on him the surname of Wu as well as the honorific title Tejin (ÁâπÈÄ≤). However, Cen would soon offend Wu Zetian and her Wu clan members. There had been a movement started by the official Zhang Jiafu and the commoner Wang Qingzhi (ÁéãÊÖ∂‰πã) to have Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Chengsi made crown prince‚Äîunder the theory that given that Wu Zetian was now emperor, she should be succeeded by a member of the Wu clan rather than her husband's Li clan. They circulated a petition among officials, and Cen refused to sign‚Äîand further suggested to Wu Zetian that, as Wu Dan was already crown prince, this proposal should be firmly rejected and that the group of people that Zhang and Wang had gathered before the palace to petition Wu Zetian should be disbanded. He was supported in this by fellow chancellor Ge Fuyuan. Cen and Ge's actions offended both Wu Zetian and her Wu clan members. At that time Buddhist monks from He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui) submitted a sutra, the Dayun Sutra (Â§ßÈõ≤Á∂ì), which purportedly foretold Wu Zetian's rise to power. Wu Zetian issued an edict that this find be commemorated by the construction of the impressive Dayun Temple (Â§ßÈõ≤ÂØ∫). Cen opposed this as well, further drawing her displeasure. To remove Cen from the capital Luoyang, in late 690, she ordered him lead an army against the Tufan, but even before his army could reach the front, she recalled him to Luoyang and imprisoned him. One of Wu Zetian's favored secret police officials, Lai Junchen, then tortured Cen's son who was serving as Magistrate of Lingyuan (ÈùàÊ∫ê) and obtained a confession implicating Ge and fellow chancellor Ouyang Tong, as well as a large group of other officials. In winter 691, Cen Changqian, Ge, and Ouyang were all executed. Cen Changqian's five sons were forced to commit suicide, and his ancestral tombs were destroyed. Dozens upon dozens of officials and their relatives (including Cen's) were executed, exiled, or fled to Southern China during the reign of Wu Zetian. After Emperor Ruizong was eventually restored to the throne in 710, he restored Cen's titles and reburied him with honor. His nephew (actually son of his cousin i.e. a grandson of Cen Wenben) Cen Xi later also served as a chancellor during Emperor Ruizong's and Emperor Xuanzong's reigns.

The Greek Theatre hosts The Berkeley Jazz Festival, pop, rock, and world music concerts, UC Berkeley graduation ceremonies, occasional addresses by noted speakers, and other events. Past speakers include President Theodore Roosevelt, William Randolph Hearst, and the Dalai Lama. History The Hearst Greek Theater was built in 1903 on the site of a rough outdoor bowl already in use as an amphitheater since 1894 known as \\"Ben Weed's Amphitheater\\". The project was championed by University of California president Benjamin Ide Wheeler and was the first University building designed by John Galen Howard.http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/online_exhibits/romapacifica/partv_jgeda293.html Its construction was financed by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, after whom it was named. The design of the theater is based directly on the ancient Greek theater of Epidaurus. It officially opened on September 24, 1903 with a student production of The Birds by Aristophanes. However, while still under construction in May 1903, the theatre hosted a graduation ceremony with an address by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a friend of Wheeler's from New York. In 1957, a basement backstage area was added, which was designed by Ernest Born. It includes a large plaza flanked by two stage-level constructions. In 1967 The Grateful Dead played the Greek for the first time, and went on to play 29 total concerts here by 1989. https://www.setlists.net/?search=true&venue;=Greek+Theater&city;=&state;=&month;=&day;=&year;=&songs;=&submit;=Search It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Background  Little is known about Wang Benli's career before his brief stint as chancellor; atypical for a chancellor, he did not have a biography in either the Old Book of Tang or the New Book of Tang.See the Table of Contents for the Old Book of Tang and the Table of Contents for the New Book of Tang. Further, it is not known where his family was from, as he was not listed among any branch of the Wang clan in the table of chancellors' family trees.See New Book of Tang, vol. 72, part 2 The first reference to him in historical accounts was in 679, when he was serving as a secretary at the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). He was said to be favored by Emperor Gaozong and, on account of that favor, was committing many illegal deeds and intimidating other officials. The censor, Di Renjie, accused him of crimes, and initially, Emperor Gaozong was set to pardon him. At Di's insistence--pointing out that the empire did not lack people with Wang's talent--Emperor Gaozong relented and allowed Wang to be punished. By 683, Wang was serving as the commandant at Sheng Prefecture (ÂãùÂ∑û, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), when Eastern Tujue's khan Ashina Gudulu attacked the nearby Chanyu Protector General headquarters (ÂñÆ‰∫éÁ∏ΩÁù£Â∫ú, also in modern Hohhot), capturing and killing the official Zhang Xingshi (ÂºµË°åÂ∏´). Emperor Gaozong sent Wang, along with Li Chongyi (ÊùéÂ¥áÁæ©) the commandant at Xia Prefecture (Â§èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi), to defend against the Eastern Tujue attack, but historical accounts did not indicate what the results were.  During Empress dowager's Wu regency  Emperor Gaozong died later in 683 and was succeeded by his son Li Zhe the Crown Prince (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. In spring 684, after he showed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with his younger brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong), but thereafter wielded power even more firmly. In 687, when her trusted advisor, the chancellor Liu Yizhi was accused of accepting bribes from the Khitan chieftain Sun Wanrong and conducting an affair with a concubine of the deceased chancellor Xu Jingzong. (Historical accounts imply heavily that the real reason why Liu was accused was because Empress Dowager Wu had received reports that he favored that she return imperial authority to Emperor Ruizong, which she saw as a betrayal.) Empress Dowager Wu ordered Wang Benli, who was then serving as the prefect of Su Prefecture (ËÇÖÂ∑û, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu), to investigate. When Wang went to Liu's mansion to read Empress Dowager Wu's edict to Liu, Liu responded, \\"How can it be called an edict if it was not issued through the legislative and examination bureaus?\\" When Wang reported this comment back to Empress Dowager Wu, she became incensed and ordered Liu to commit suicide. By 688, Wang was serving as the deputy minister of defense (Â§èÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Xiaguan Shilang), when he was given the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. In 689, his chancellor designation was elevated to the more honored Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ). By spring 690, he was referred to as chancellor and imperial censor reviewing central government affairs (Â∑¶ËÇÖÊîøÂ§ßÂ§´, Zuo Suzheng Daifu), when he was removed as a chancellor and made the minister of treasury (Âú∞ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Diguan Shangsu).

She was Emperor He's second wife, and after his death \\"ruled the Empire for the next decade and a half with conspicuous competence.\\" As empress dowager, she served as regent for Emperor He's son Emperor Shang and nephew Emperor An in 106-121, and she was regarded as an able and diligent administrator. She is also considered responsible for the world's first official adoption of paper, and was a patron of the arts. During her regency, she cut palace expenses, provided relief for the poor, was able to meet the challenge of natural disasters including crippling floods, droughts and hailstorms in several parts of the empire, as well as largely quelling wars with Xiongnu and Qiang. She was praised for her attention to criminal justice. Well educated, Empress Deng created new positions for scholars, encouraged original thinking, and was responsible for the standardization of the five classics.Monro, Alexander, The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention (Vintage Books, 2017) She called 70 members of the imperial families to study the classics and oversaw their examinations herself.Monro, Alexander, The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention (Vintage Books, 2017) She is seen as the last effective ruler of the Han Empire, as the later Emperors and Empress Dowagers are pulled into internal power struggles and corruption, leading to the fall of the Empire. Family background and early life Deng Sui was born in 81 AD in Nanyang. Her father Deng Xun (ÈÑßË®ì) was the sixth son of Emperor Guangwu's prime minister Deng Yu. Her mother, Lady Yin, was a daughter of a cousin of Emperor Guangwu's wife Empress Yin Lihua. She had a noted interest in studying, being able to read historical texts at age six and being able to recite the shujing and lunyu when she was twelve.Bennet Peterson, Barbara (2000). p. 115. She was selected to be in the palace in 95. She became a consort to Emperor He in 96, when she was 15, and he was 17. Imperial consort and empress When Deng Sui became an imperial consort, Emperor He had already created Empress Yin empress. Empress Yin was described as beautiful but short and clumsy, and she was also known for jealousy. Consort Deng tried to foster a proper relationship with her by being humble, and was described as constantly trying to cover Empress Yin's mistakes. This, however, only drew Empress Yin's jealousy, as Emperor He became impressed with her and considered her one of his favorites. Empress Yin was also not pleased that Consort Deng, concerned that Emperor He was constantly losing sons in childhood, often recommended other consorts for him to have sexual relations with. Once, when Emperor He was ill, Empress Yin made the remark that if she became empress dowager, the Dengs would be slaughtered‚Äîand upon hearing that remark, Consort Deng considered committing suicide, and one of her ladies in waiting saved her by falsely telling her that the emperor had recovered. However, the emperor did soon recover, so Consort Deng and her family escaped a terrible fate. In 102, Empress Yin and her grandmother, Deng Zhu (ÈÑßÊú±), were accused of using witchcraft to curse imperial consorts (probably including Consort Deng). She was deposed and died of sorrow, probably in 102 as well. Emperor He created Consort Deng empress to replace her. As empress, Empress Deng was described as diligent and humble, and she resisted offers by Emperor He to promote her relatives. She was taught by Ban Zhao, whom she made a Lady-in-Waiting.Bennet Peterson. Barbara (2000). p. 102. She also prohibited the commanderies and principalities from offering her tributes‚Äîwhich had been customary for empresses to receive. As Empress, she refused all tributes from abroad, insisting on receiving annual gifts of paper and ink instead. Monro, Alexander, The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention (Vintage Books, 2017)  Regent for Emperor Shang  In 106, with China facing a financial crisis, Emperor He died, creating a succession crisis. Empress Deng and all of the imperial consorts had been without sons for a long time. (Emperor He was described as having had a number of sons who died in young age; it is unclear whether Empresses Yin or Deng ever gave birth, but it appears that they did not.) Late in Emperor He's reign, he had two sons‚Äîwhose mothers were not mentioned in history‚ÄîLiu Sheng and Liu Long. Under the superstition of the time, it was thought that they might survive better if they grew up outside the palace in light of their other brothers' early deaths, so both were given to foster parents. At the time Emperor He died, Liu Sheng, the older son, was still young (but actual age is not recorded in history) and believed to be constantly ill. The younger, Liu Long, was only 100 days old. Both were welcomed back to the palace, and Empress Deng created Liu Long crown prince, believing that he would be healthier, and then that night he was proclaimed emperor, as Emperor Shang. Power was in Empress Dowager Deng's hands, as regent for the infant emperor, and her brother Deng Zhi (ÈÑßÈ®≠) quickly became the most powerful official at court. She also sought the advice of Ban Zhao, until her death in 116. She issued a general pardon, which benefitted the people who had rights stripped from them for associating with the family of Empress Dou, whose family had been powerful during the early reign of Emperor He but had been toppled in a coup d'√©tat. Late in 106, the young emperor died, creating yet another succession crisis. By this time, the officials had realized that Prince Sheng (then Prince of Pingyuan) was not as ill as initially thought, and they generally wanted him to be emperor. However, Empress Dowager Deng, concerned that Prince Sheng would bear a grudge for not having been made emperor first, had other ideas. She insisted on making Emperor Shang's cousin Prince Hu, who was seen by some as the rightful heir, emperor instead. He took the throne as Emperor An, at age 12. As regent for Emperor An When Emperor An ascended the throne, his father Liu Qing was still alive, as was his wife Consort Geng‚Äîwho had remained in the capital Luoyang with him until his ascension. (Emperor An's mother Consort Zuo Xiao'e (Â∑¶Â∞èÂ®•), Liu Qing's concubine, had died sometime earlier.) However, Deng Sui was able to ensure exclusive control over the young emperor still, as empress dowager, by sending Consort Geng to join her husband Liu Qing in his Principality of Qinghe. Deng Sui showed herself to be an able regent who did not tolerate corruption, even by her own family members. She also carried out criminal law reforms. For example, in 107, she issued an edict that extended the period for death penalty appeals. She cut the expenses of the royal court, like the making of expensive handicrafts such as jade and ivory carvings and sent home palace attendants with superfluous functions. She also demanded less tribute from the provinces.Bennet Peterson, Barbara (2000). p. 116. While Empress, she twice opened the imperial granaries to feed the hungry; forced the reduction of income landlords received from the land they rented out; she repaired waterways and cut court rituals and banquets.Monro, Alexander, The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention (Vintage Books, 2017) In 107, however, there would be major problems on the borders. First, kingdoms of the Western Regions (or Xiyu, modern Xinjiang and Central Asia), which had submitted to Han suzerainty during the times of the great general Ban Chao, had been resisting Ban's successors for some time due to their harsh regulations, and in 107, Empress Dowager Deng finally decreed that Xiyu be abandoned. That same year, Qiang tribes, who had been oppressed by Han officials for more than a decade and fearful that they would be ordered to quell Xiyu rebellions, rebelled themselves. This was a major rebellion, affecting a wide region over modern Shaanxi, Gansu, and northern Sichuan, and Qiang forces even made incursions into modern Shanxi and threatened the capital at one point. The situation became so severe that Deng Zhi considered abandoning Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, roughly modern Gansu), a proposal that Empress Dowager Deng wisely rejected. The rebellion would not be put down until 118, by which point the western empire was in shambles. Also, in 107 to 109, there were many natural disasters‚Äîfloods, droughts, and hail, in different parts of the empire. Empress Dowager Deng was largely effective in organizing disaster relief efforts. In 109, South Xiongnu, which had been a loyal vassal up to this point, rebelled as well, believing that Han had been so weakened by Qiang rebellions that it would be easy target. However, after Han made a strong show of force, South Xiongnu submitted again and would not become a trouble spot for the rest of Han Dynasty. In 110, Empress Dowager Deng's mother Lady Yin died. Her brothers resigned their posts to observe a period of mourning for three years, and after initially not approving the request, she eventually did, under female scholar Ban Zhao's suggestion. Even though they were without major government posts, however, they remained powerful advisors. As the years went by, Empress Dowager Deng's original humble nature appeared to entirely wear away as she hung onto power, and when some of her relatives and close associates suggested that she transfer the authorities to Emperor An, she became angry at them and would not do so. In 121, Empress Dowager Deng died and was buried with her husband Emperor He with full honors. Emperor An finally took power at age 28. His wet nurse Wang Sheng (ÁéãËÅñ) and trusted eunuchs Li Run (ÊùéÈñè) and Jiang Jing (Ê±ü‰∫¨), who had waited for years to have power, falsely accused Empress Dowager Deng of having considered deposing Emperor An and replacing him with his cousin, Liu Yi (ÂäâÁøº) the Prince of Hejian. In anger, Emperor An removed all of Empress Dowager Deng's relatives from government and forced many of them to commit suicide. Later that year, however, he partially reversed his orders, and some of Empress Dowager Deng's relatives were allowed to return, but the clan had been decimated by then. Notes It is said that the Deng (depending on dialect, the word could be spelled as (Tang, Teng, Thean, Thian, Thien).

On Holocaust Memorial Day observed in the Jewish calendar (Yom HaShoah), thousands of participants march silently from Auschwitz to Birkenau, the largest Nazi concentration camp complex built during World War II. History The program was established in 1988 and takes place annually for two weeks around April and May, immediately following Passover. Marchers have come from over 50 countries, as diverse as United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, Estonia, Panama, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, and Turkey. The Israeli founders of the March of the Living were Avraham Hirschson and Dr. Shmuel Rosenman. They were assisted in the early years by Jewish communal leaders and philanthropists from the United States (Alvin Schiff, Gene Greenzweig and Joseph Wilf, the first North American Chair of the March of the Living), and Canada (Walter Hess, Shlomo Shimon, Rabbi Irwin Witty, and Eli Rubenstein).  Commemoration of World War II death marches  The climax of the program is the March, which is designed to contrast with the death marches which occurred towards the end of World War II. When Nazi Germany withdrew its soldiers from forced-labour camps, inmates ‚Äì most already starving and stricken by oppressive work ‚Äì were forced to march hundreds of miles further west, while those who lagged behind or fell were shot or left to freeze to death in the winter climate. The March of the Living, in contrast to the death marches, serves to illustrate the continued existence of the Jewish people despite Nazi attempts at their obliteration. After spending a week in Poland visiting other sites of Nazi Germany's persecution, such as Majdanek, Treblinka, and the Warsaw Ghetto, and former sites of Jewish life and culture, various Synagogues, many of the participants in the March also travel on to Israel where they observe Yom Hazikaron (Israel's Remembrance Day) and celebrate Yom Haatzmaut (Israel's Independence Day).  Educational value  The March of the Living is mainly aimed at Jewish high school students and its goals are both universal (fighting indifference, racism and injustice) and particular (opposing anti-semitism, and strengthening their sense of Jewish identity).13 Goals of the March of the Living A key element of the program is the participation of Holocaust survivors who share the memories of their war-time experiences with the students, while they are still well enough to participate in this challenging two-week trip of the young. Though the vast majority of participants in the March of the Living are Jewish high school students from different countries including Israel, there are many non-Jewish groups in attendance, along with adult groups such as the Polish Friends of Israel, Japan's Bridges for Peace and others. One of the largest groups are students from Polish schools, with over 1,000 attending annually in recent years.  Exhibit  In mid January 2014 a new exhibit on the March of the Living opened at the United Nations, which housed the exhibit until the end of March 2014.March of the Living Exhibit Opening at the United Nations videos. Titled \\"When you Listen to a Witness, You Become a Witness\\", the exhibit includes photographs, documents and writings devoted to the 25-year history of the March of the Living. The exhibit tells the stories of the aging survivors and their young students who, hand in hand, embark on a life-changing journey and return profoundly transformed. It also contains archival photos of deportation and mass murder from the Holocaust period.

Holocaust exhibit at UN stresses memory and hope The Times of Israel 2014. On March 10, 2014, a group of students from New York's Pine Bush High School - part of a district where there have been press reports alleging widespread anti-Semitism - visited the UN Exhibit. They were addressed by Holocaust survivors Judy Weissenberg Cohen and Fanya Heller, as well as by Rick Carrier, a World War II Liberator. In November 2015, the Exhibit was mounted at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. The UN Exhibit became the basis of a book published in the fall of 2015, titled, Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations. The book has a unique interactive feature where the survivors, World War II liberators, and Righteous Among the Nations featured in the book, include an invisible link embedded on their image. When their image is accessed with a smart phone or other device, the reader is taken to an excerpt of their video testimony on USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education (created by Steven Spielberg) or March of the Living Digital Archive Project websites. Translations in several other languages are already in the works. President of Poland Andrzej Duda with Aharon Tamir, Deputy Chairman, March of the Living In recent years the March of the Living (MOTL) has attempted to broaden its focus from only concentrating on the Holocaust, and include other program content in the Poland portion of the trip. These elements include: celebrating Jewish life before the war, establishing dialogue with Polish students, meeting with Polish Righteous among the Nations, and connecting with the contemporary Polish Jewish community. In April 2017, in a speech to the March of the Living program at Auschwitz for Holocaust Remembrance Day, Elisha Wiesel said that the United States and European countries had not learned the lessons of the Holocaust, because many in those countries had turned away Syrian refugees fleeing chemical warfare. Wiesel added: \\"Will you stand by when African-Americans have reason to be terrified of a routine traffic stop, when Christians are slaughtered in Egypt because they are labelled infidels, when girls in Chad, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are threatened, raped, or shot for pursuing an education, when homosexuality in Iran is a crime that carries the death penalty?\\"Naomi Zeveloff (April 25, 2017). \\"Elie Wiesel's Son; Holocaust Lessons Unheeded in Syria Disaster,\\" The Forward.Elisha Wiesel (April 24, 2017). \\"Elisha Wiesel‚Äôs speech urges Jews not to be silent observers of injustice,\\" The Canadian Jewish NewsElisha Wiesel (April 25, 2017). \\"My father was a witness, and now I will be a witness (op-ed),\\" Ynet.  Supplementary programs  The March of Remembrance and Hope (MRH) is a program designed for university/college students of all religions and backgrounds. This program, founded in 2001, takes place in May, and in recent years, has included a 2-day trip to Germany, before the 5 day Poland portion of the trip. The purpose of the March of Remembrance and Hope is to teach students of various religious and ethnic backgrounds about the dangers of intolerance through the study of the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, and to promote better relations among people of diverse cultures. Holocaust survivors also participate in the March of Remembrance and Hope program. Since its inception, students of a wide variety of religions and ethnicities have taken part.  Cultural impact  In 2009 two different documentaries featured March of the Living participants or students on similar experiences during their time on the trip. The documentary Defamation, by filmmaker Yoav Shamir, includes a group of Israeli students during their time at Poland sites, including the stop at Auschwitz. Director Jessica Sanders made a documentary titled March of the Living, which focuses entirely on the program and participants. Late 2015 saw the release of Blind Love, a documentary film about blind Israelis traveling to Poland with the help of their guide dogs on the March of the Living to learn about the Holocaust. The film, Blind Love: A Holocaust Journey Through Poland with Man's Best Friend, premiered during Holocaust Education Week in Toronto, with the co-sponsorship of the Toronto Jewish Film Festival. It was also broadcast on the CBC's Canadian speciality channel Documentary in late 2015 and then again in 2017 on Holocaust Remembrance Day, as well as in Israel on its main station Channel 10 (Israel) on the same day.  2020 cancellation  For the first time since its inception in 1988, the March of the Living program to Poland and Israel was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting thousands of prospective participants ‚Äì including students, survivors, educators and dignitaries from around the world. In response, the March of the Living created 3 initiatives. The March of the Living Virtual Plaque Project continued the March of the Living tradition of placing messages of peace, hope and remembrance, on wooden plaques on the train tracks of Auschwitz-Birkenau on Holocaust Remembrance Day. March of the Living offered a digital option of submitting virtual plaques with personal messages, which would be featured on the March of the Living website in the days leading to Holocaust Remembrance Day and beyond. The first plaque was submitted by Israeli President, Reuven Rivlin, followed by other well-known figures including Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and Mayim Bialik. On the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, a number of plaques were projected onto the guard tower and gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The current number of completed plaques is approaching 18,000. In place of the actual March of the Living walk and ceremony in Auschwitz-Birkenau on Holocaust Remembrance Day, a March of the Living Virtual Ceremony was held on Holocaust Remembrance Day. The program featured Israeli President Rivlin, USC Shoah Foundation Founder Steven Spielberg, survivor testimony, speeches from student Alumni and Holocaust educators, and performances from past March of the Living singers and musicians. A student led virtual candle lighting ceremony mirroring the torch lighting ceremony that would conclude the ceremony on Auschwitz-Birkenau was also held. The virtual ceremony was sponsored by The Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience at Rutgers University, with the participation of the USC Shoah Foundation, whose 360 Degree survivor testimony interviews ‚Äì utilizing the testimony of March of the Living survivor testimony in situ - was highlighted during the ceremony. The ceremony was broadcast live on Facebook, on Jewish Broadcasting Service Television as well as on Reuters Europe.ceremony ‚ÄúThis year, for the first time in 32 years, we are not able to march in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but that will not stop us. We will continue to educate the next generation with the values we have been teaching for three decades.‚ÄùDr. Shmuel Rosenman, March of the Living Chairman, ‚Äú ‚ÄúWe were bitterly disappointed to have to postpone this year‚Äôs March of the Living.

Reuven Rivlin, President of Israel, who was the honoured with filling out the initial plaque, stated: ‚Äú75 years after the Holocaust the terrible tragedy of our people as antisemitism raises its ugly head once again across the world the nations of the world must stand together.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 1992. In this episode, Homer gets a heart attack due to his very poor health and diet. Dr. Hibbert tells Homer that he needs a triple bypass, but the Simpson family resorts to a discount surgeon after learning how expensive the operation would be in a regular hospital. The episode was written by Gary Apple and Michael Carrington and directed by David Silverman. Plot After Marge warns him about eating too much fatty foods, Homer starts to feel chest pains in the next morning. He chooses breakfast from bacon and eggs, instead of oatmeal for breakfast. During his travel to work, he feels his heart thumping, but he believes that is a malfunction in the gearbox. He stops at a gas station, where the mechanic tells him that is probably his heart. At work, Mr. Burns yells at Homer for poor performance and threatens him with dismissal. Homer has a heart attack, but regains consciousness after Burns tells Smithers to send a ham to the widow. Upon learning that he is alive, Burns cancels the package, to the chagrin of Homer. Homer is sent to the hospital, Dr. Hibbert informs him and Marge that he needs a coronary artery bypass surgery, which will cost him $30,000. Hearing this, Homer has another heart attack, increasing the price to $40,000. Without any health insurance from work, Homer figures out a way to pay for the operation. He goes to The Merry Widow Insurance Company, but is denied when he has another heart attack before signing the policy. Marge and Homer then see a commercial for Dr. Nick Riviera, an incompetent surgeon who will perform any operation for $129.95. With no other options, Homer goes for the cheaper service. Dr. Nick, unfamiliar with the procedure, rents an instructional video, but the important steps of the procedure have been taped over. During Homer's operation, he realizes he does not know what to do. Lisa, watching the operation in the amphitheatre, uses her knowledge of cardiology to guide Dr. Nick. The surgery is successful and Homer makes a full recovery. Production James L. Brooks had the initial idea for the episode, but the subject matter made some writers uncomfortable. The idea for \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\" came from James L. Brooks, who pitched the idea of Homer having a heart attack. However, the writers disagreed with such a heavy topic as this. The episode was not written by a member of the show's regular staff, but was instead scripted by freelance writers Gary Apple and Michael Carrington, who were hired by Brooks due to the show suffering from a depleted writing team after the third season ended, and because the remaining members did not bother to do the episode. Carrington would provide voice work for later episodes, such as \\"I Love Lisa\\" (as Sideshow Raheem), \\"Homer and Apu\\" (as a comedian), and \\"Simpson Tide\\" (as Homer's drill instructor). Apple and Carrington decided to have a scene where Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were unsure of how to do it, so they approached Brooks, who made up the entire scene on the spot. Originally, the surgery was supposed to be performed by Dr. Hibbert, but it was later changed to Dr. Nick. In the original airing of the episode, Dr. Nick's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic, whose lawyers made them change it to 1-600-DOCTORB. The episode's production staff decided that David Silverman would be able to make the episode funny, so he was selected to direct it. He went \\"all out\\" and did his best to make Homer's grimaces as humorous as possible, to keep the episode at least somewhat lighter in tone. Silverman added some special touches: for example, when Homer has an out of body experience, his foot was still touching his body to signify that he was not dead. A doctor acted as a medical consultant for the episode. The episode was to have concluded with Homer eating a pizza in his hospital bed following the operation, and with Marge asking a nurse where the pizza had come from. This reflects the earlier flashback scene where Grampa Simpson watches Homer as an infant, chewing on a slice of pizza in the hospital. The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care. Cultural references The opening sequence of the episode is a parody of American television show COPS; it was not in the original animatic and added later because the episode was too short to fit in its required 22-minute length. When Homer is performing a sock-puppet show to Lisa and Bart, he uses Akbar and Jeff, both of whom are characters from Matt Groening's weekly comic strip Life in Hell. Homer follows behind the house that was the birthplace of Edgar Allan Poe, which was placed in the episode by David Silverman. During this scene Homer starts to hear a heartbeat, a reference to Poe's \\"The Telltale Heart\\". The scene where Homer sings in a church as a boy is based on the film Empire of the Sun. When Homer tries to allay his children's concern over his forthcoming heart operation by telling them only bad people die, Bart then asks about Abraham Lincoln, to which Homer incorrectly tells him that he sold poisoned milk to schoolchildren, which is a reference to Abraham Lincoln's mother Nancy who died of milk sickness, an illness that is caused by drinking the milk of cows that have eaten the poisonous herb white snakeroot. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\" finished 16th in ratings for the week of December 14‚Äì20, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.3, equivalent to approximately 13.2 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, called it \\"a cautionary tale that gives Dr Nick his biggest chance to shine.\\" They also praised the \\"cloud goes up, cloud goes down\\" line.

The program aired on the Independent Film Channel with Favreau the co-executive producer with Peter Billingsley.  Format  The show format was a spontaneous, open forum for people in the entertainment community. The idea, originally conceived by Favreau, originated from a time when he went out to dinner with colleagues on a film location and exchanged filming anecdotes. Favreau said, \\"I thought it would be interesting to show people that side of the business\\". He did not want to present them in a \\"sensationalized way [that] they're presented in the press, but as normal people\\". The format featured Favreau and four guests from the entertainment industry in a restaurant with no other diners. They ordered actual food from real menus and were served by authentic waiters. There were no cue cards or previous research on the participants that would have allowed him to orchestrate the conversation and the guests were allowed to talk about whatever they wanted. The show used five cameras with the operators using long lenses so that they could be at least ten feet away from the table and not intrude on the conversation or make the guests self-conscious. The conversations lasted until the film ran out. A 25-minutes episode would be edited from the two-hour dinner. The one exception to the standard format was Favreau having a conversation with Martin Scorsese, done in a more traditional interview style. The show was canceled by IFC in favor of The Henry Rollins Show because the network felt that \\"four years in, we needed to make a change, and we needed to make a bold statement.\\" Netflix and the Independent Film Channel produced a special 50th episode of Dinner for Five, which premiered on IFC February 1, 2008 and is available on Netflix starting February 4, 2008. The 50th episode features Favreau and Vaughn, as well as Peter Billingsley, Justin Long and Keir O'Donnell, who appear in Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show.

Introduced in a 1949 paper Embedding Theorems for Groups by Graham Higman, Bernhard Neumann, and Hanna Neumann, it embeds a given group G into another group G' , in such a way that two given isomorphic subgroups of G are conjugate (through a given isomorphism) in G' . Construction Let G be a group with presentation G = langle S mid Rrangle , and let alphacolon H to K be an isomorphism between two subgroups of G. Let t be a new symbol not in S, and define :G*_{alpha} = left langle S,t mid R, tht^{-1}=alpha(h), forall hin H right rangle. The group G*_{alpha} is called the HNN extension of G relative to Œ±. The original group G is called the base group for the construction, while the subgroups H and K are the associated subgroups. The new generator t is called the stable letter. Key properties Since the presentation for G*_{alpha} contains all the generators and relations from the presentation for G, there is a natural homomorphism, induced by the identification of generators, which takes G to G*_{alpha}. Higman, Neumann, and Neumann proved that this morphism is injective, that is, an embedding of G into G*_{alpha}. A consequence is that two isomorphic subgroups of a given group are always conjugate in some overgroup; the desire to show this was the original motivation for the construction. =Britton's Lemma= A key property of HNN-extensions is a normal form theorem known as Britton's Lemma.Roger C. Lyndon and Paul E. Schupp. Combinatorial Group Theory. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001. \\"Classics in Mathematics\\" series, reprint of the 1977 edition. ; Ch. IV. Free Products and HNN Extensions. Let G*_{alpha} be as above and let w be the following product in G*_{alpha}: :w=g_0 t^{varepsilon_1} g_1 t^{varepsilon_2} cdots g_{n-1} t^{varepsilon_n}g_n, qquad g_i in G, varepsilon_i = pm 1. Then Britton's Lemma can be stated as follows: > Britton's Lemma. If w = 1 in G‚àóŒ± then *either n = 0 and g0 = 1 in G *or n > > 0 and for some i ‚àà {1, ..., n‚àí1} one of the following holds: #Œµi = 1, Œµi+1 = > ‚àí1, gi ‚àà H, #Œµi = ‚àí1, Œµi+1 = 1, gi ‚àà K. In contrapositive terms, Britton's Lemma takes the following form: > Britton's Lemma (alternate form). If w is such that *either n = 0 and g0 ‚â† 1 > ‚àà G, *or n > 0 and the product w does not contain substrings of the form > tht‚àí1, where h ‚àà H and of the form t‚àí1kt where k ‚àà K, then w e 1 in > G*_{alpha}. =Consequences of Britton's Lemma= Most basic properties of HNN-extensions follow from Britton's Lemma. These consequences include the following facts: *The natural homomorphism from G to G*_{alpha} is injective, so that we can think of G*_{alpha} as containing G as a subgroup. *Every element of finite order in G*_{alpha} is conjugate to an element of G. *Every finite subgroup of G*_{alpha} is conjugate to a finite subgroup of G. *If H eq G and K eq G then G*_{alpha} contains a subgroup isomorphic to a free group of rank two. Applications In terms of the fundamental group in algebraic topology, the HNN extension is the construction required to understand the fundamental group of a topological space X that has been 'glued back' on itself by a mapping f (see e.g. Surface bundle over the circle). That is, HNN extensions stand in relation of that aspect of the fundamental group, as free products with amalgamation do with respect to the Seifert-van Kampen theorem for gluing spaces X and Y along a connected common subspace. Between the two constructions essentially any geometric gluing can be described, from the point of view of the fundamental group. HNN-extensions play a key role in Higman's proof of the Higman embedding theorem which states that every finitely generated recursively presented group can be homomorphically embedded in a finitely presented group. Most modern proofs of the Novikov‚ÄìBoone theorem about the existence of a finitely presented group with algorithmically undecidable word problem also substantially use HNN-extensions. Both HNN- extensions and amalgamated free products are basic building blocks in the Bass‚ÄìSerre theory of groups acting on trees. The idea of HNN extension has been extended to other parts of abstract algebra, including Lie algebra theory. Generalizations HNN extensions are elementary examples of fundamental groups of graphs of groups, and as such are of central importance in Bass‚ÄìSerre theory.

The murals date from around 1800 to 1835, and are among the best-preserved examples anywhere of Porter's work. Although it is believed that about 160 Porter murals once existed in homes throughout New England, most have subsequently been destroyed by wallpapering or fading due to sunlight. The two-story, federal-style house was built circa 1809 for Oliver Reed Jr., and inhabited by four generations of the Reed family. In 1973 it was purchased by the Townsend Historical Society. Nearly everything inside is original, from the wide pine floors to the crown glass windows to the mammy bench in the kitchen. Some modernization has taken place (e.g. electricity was installed in the 1920s) but the house retains much of its nineteenth century flavor. In addition to the murals, the house contains a clothing collection and many original furnishings. Today, the home is a nonprofit house museum operated by the Townsend Historical Society.

The plot concerns a virus that kills off all forms of grass, including rice and wheat. Its publication in The Saturday Evening Post provoked considerable reaction amongst its readers on account of its portrayal of government's response to the unfolding worldwide crisis. The Death of Grass was the first of several post-apocalyptic novels written by Christopher. The novel was written in a matter of weeks and liberated Youd from his day job. It was retitled No Blade of Grass for the US edition, as supposedly the US publisher thought the original title \\"sounded like something out of a gardening catalogue\\".Robert Macfarlane, \\"Introduction\\" in The film rights were sold to MGM.John Christopher's life and works Plot A new virus strain has infected rice crops in East Asia causing massive famine; the virus is also revealed to be found in the UK but because of its selectivity does not affect the country's agriculture. After the introduction of a new pesticide, developed in preference to breeding resistant crops, a mutated virus appears and infects the staple crops of West Asia and Europe such as wheat and barley‚Äîall of the grasses (thus the novel's title). It threatens a famine engulfing the whole of the Old World, while Australasia and the Americas attempt to impose rigorous quarantine to keep the virus out. The novel follows the struggles of engineer John Custance and his friend, civil servant Roger Buckley, as, along with their families, they make their way across an England which is rapidly descending into anarchy, hoping to reach the safety of John's brother's potato farm in an isolated Westmorland valley. Buckley, having advance warning of the government's plot to hydrogen bomb major cities, alerts Custance to evacuate. Picking up a travelling companion in a gun shop owner named Pirrie after an attempt to procure arms, they find they must sacrifice many of their morals in order to stay alive. At one point, when their food supply runs out, they kill a family to take their bread. The protagonist justifies this with the belief that \\"it was them or us.\\" By the time they reach the valley, they have accumulated a considerable entourage as a result of their encounters with other groups of survivors along the way. They find that John's brother is unable to let them all in to the heavily defended valley. Pirrie prevents John from taking only his immediate family into the valley; instead, the group takes the valley by force. Pirrie and John's brother are killed; John takes possession of the valley.

It is situated north from Bourne, and south-east from Grantham. According to the 2011 Census the parish had a population of 2,406. History The village is in two parts, one each side of the fen-edge road, the A15. To the fenward side is Morton and to the upland side is Hanthorpe. The earlier name is that of Morton which will come from the acid peat land which the Anglian settlers found in the fen in around the year 500. The name therefore indicates that the fen was to a significant extent better called the bog in modern terminology. They were Germanic speakers so they called it a moor. Hanthorpe is a name indicating a subsidiary settlement established in the period of the Danish settlements, probably in the tenth century. The church and the later signs of the manorial centre are in Morton. The church is built in the Early English and Perpendicular styles, and was restored in 1860 and 1951. A baptist chapel was built in 1875, and still serves the village today. In the late 19th century Morton Road railway station opened in 1872 and finally closed in 1964. A gazetteer of the 19th century said: George Hussey Packe, the 19th-century South Lincolnshire Member of Parliament and chairman of the Great Northern Railway, was born at Hanthorpe Hall in 1796.Sylvanus, Urban; The Gentleman's Magazine (1837), volume 7, p.656Howard, Joseph Jackson, Crisp, Frederick Arthur (1899); Visitations of England and Wales, volume 7, p.167. Geography Morton lies on the western margin of The Fens on three sorts of land, the upland, the fen edge and the fen. The parish was laid out in an elongated form so as to provide access to each of these. At the highest edge, in the west, the geology is chalky till (boulder clay) but most of the upland is Jurassic, including a little Oxford Clay but mostly Kellaways Sand and some Cornbrash and Kellaways Clay. The fen edge consists of First Terrace Gravel with a little Glacial Gravel. The landward part of the fen was black soil, composed largely of peat. Over the two and half centuries since the land was drained, this has largely oxidized away leaving the underlying First Terrace gravel and the mainly clays of the Barroway Drove Beds. These beds form the central part of the fen as well, as they do at the eastern end of the parish. However, there, there is a broad ridge of the Terrington Beds, the remains of a huge marine creek which was not laid down until the Bronze Age and was still active when the Romans diverted Bourne Eau into it by means of what is called by archaeologists 'the Bourne-Morton Canal'. Our medieval ancestors knew it as the Old Ea. Community The parish has 921 households in Morton and 74 in Hanthorpe. Morton Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. The ecclesiastical parish is Morton (Bourne), part of the Ringstone and Aveland group of the deanery of Beltisloe, Diocese of Lincoln.

The Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II was part of an effort by the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) to strike at the United Kingdom and its overseas empire throughout the Middle East during World War II.  Background  On 10 June 1940, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on the French Republic and the United Kingdom. The Italian invasion of France was short- lived and the French signed an armistice with the Italians on 25 June, three days after France's armistice with Germany. This left the British and the forces of the Commonwealth of Nations for the Italians to contend with in the Middle East. The Italian air force wanted to hit the British controlled areas of the Middle East: the refineries and ports of Palestine were the first chosen. Successively on 19 October 1940, four Italian SM.82s bombers attacked American-operated oil refineries in the British Protectorate of Bahrain, damaging the local refineries.Air Raid! A Sequel Aramco World Magazine, Volume 27, Number 4, July/August 1976. The raid also struck Dhahran in Saudi Arabia, but caused little damage.  Bombing campaign  Starting in July 1940, the Italian bombings in the British Mandate of Palestine were primarily centered on Tel Aviv and Haifa. However, many other coastal towns such as Acre and Jaffa also suffered. The last Italian bombing on the territories of the British Mandate of Palestine occurred in June 1941. Haifa and Tel Aviv where hit, but with little damage and few casualties. = Bombing of Haifa = Haifa was hit many times by the Italians, because of the port and refinery, starting in June 1940. The 29 July 1940 issue of Time reported a bombing at Haifa by SM82 bombers during the previous week, with a dozen casualties. According to Time magazine, the Italians claimed a huge success which the British did not deny. Where the British oil pipeline from Mosul reaches tidewater, \\"Ten big Italian bombers, flying at great altitude from the Dodecanese Islands, giving the British bases at Cyprus a wide berth, dropped 50 bombs on the Haifa oil terminal and refinery.\\" The bombing started fires which burned for many days afterwards, and the refinery's production was blocked for nearly one month. British fighters from a base on Mt. Carmel were too late to overtake the Italians returning to their base in Italian Dodecanese. = Bombing of Tel Aviv = On 9 September 1940, a bombing raid on Tel Aviv caused 137 deaths. There was another raid on Tel Aviv on 12 June 1941 with 13 deaths, done by the Italians or by the French, based in Syria. Historian Alberto Rosselli pinpointed that the bombing of Tel Aviv that killed 137 people was because the Italian bombers were on their way to the strategic port and refineries of Haifa, but were intercepted by British aircraft. Forced to go back, the Italians received orders to drop their bombs on the port of Tel Aviv, but in attempting to avoid the attacking British planes they dropped the bombs by mistake on a civilian area near the port.

The senior Spaulding started construction of a third leatherboard mill at North Rochester, New Hampshire. It began production in 1900 shortly after his death. The three Spaulding sons were successful and acquired the Spaulding Brothers mill in Townsend Harbor in 1902, making it part of J. Spaulding and Sons. They later moved their corporate offices to Rochester, New Hampshire. The three brothers continued to expand the business, building a vulcanized fibre mill in Tonawanda, New York in 1911, and a fourth leatherboard mill at a second location in Milton in 1913. They continued the company as J. Spaulding and Sons until about 1924, when they changed its name to the Spaulding Fibre Company to reflect its product. The corporate offices were moved to Tonawanda, New York, as that plant became the biggest operation. It reached its peak of production and employment in the 1960s, after having added product lines in Spauldite (a competitor for Bakelite) and a fiberglass tube. Operation of the leatherboard mill at Townsend Harbor ceased in 1957, after the last two surviving siblings, Huntley Spaulding and his married sister Marion S. Potter, died.

On December 18, 1996, however, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the sentence (but not the conviction) because a prospective juror had been erroneously dismissed. The appeals court ordered a new punishment trial, which took place on January 26, 1999; the new trial again sentenced Howard to death. This new sentence was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 19, 2001. On March 30, 2005 after appealing to the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the District Court for the Southern District of Texas his execution date was set as October 6. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, Howard continued to regret his actions and worked to stop at-risk youth following his lead. Death Howard was executed by lethal injection on October 6, 2005 in Huntsville, Texas. When asked by the warden if he had a final statement, he looked at the family of Davidson and said: \\"Yes sir, I do. To the victim's family, I hope it helps a little. I do not know how, but I hope it helps.\\" He then looked at his family and friends and said: \\"I love you all, all of you. You know I love you. Thank you for bringing my children back to my life. Thank you. I love you all. I love you all very much. Thank you very much.\\" Howard was pronounced dead at 6:24 pm.

Jute plants (Corchorus olitorius). Jute is one of the important natural fibers after cotton in terms of cultivation and usage. Cultivation is dependent on the climate, season, and soil. Almost 85% of the world's jute cultivation is concentrated in the Ganges Delta. This fertile geographic region is shared by both Bangladesh and India (mainly West Bengal). China also has a dominating place in jute cultivation. On a smaller scale, Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), Pakistan, Nepal, and Bhutan also cultivate jute. Cultivation To grow jute, farmers scatter the seeds on cultivated soil. When the plants are about 15‚Äì20 cm tall, they are thinned out. About four months after planting, harvesting begins. The plants are usually harvested after they flower, before the flowers go to seed. The stalks are cut off close to the ground. The stalks are tied into bundles and soaked in water for about 20 days. This process softens the tissues and breaks the hard [pectin] bond between the bast and [Jute hurd] (inner woody fiber stick) and the process permits the fibres to be separated. The fibres are then stripped from the stalks in long strands and washed in clear, running water. Then they are hung up or spread on thatched roofs to dry. After 2‚Äì3 days of drying, the fibres are tied into bundles. The suitable climate for growing jute is a warm and wet climate, which is offered by the monsoon climate during the fall season, immediately followed by summer. Temperatures ranging to more than 25 ¬∞C and relative humidity of 70%‚Äì90% are favorable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 160‚Äì200 cm of rainfall weekly with extra needed during the sowing period. River basins or alluvial or loamy soils are best for jute cultivation. Jute cultivation in red soils may require high dose of manure and pH range between 4.8-5.8 is best for its cultivation. Plain land or gentle slope or low land is ideal for jute cultivation. Since the jute seeds are small in size, land should be prepared to fine tilling, which can be done by careful ploughing. Retting Jute fiber is being dehydrated in sunlight after natural or microbial retting Retting is the process of extracting fibers from the long lasting life stem or bast of the bast fiber plants. The available retting processes are: mechanical retting (hammering), chemical retting (boiling & applying chemicals), steam/vapor/dew retting, and water or microbial retting. Among them, the water or microbial retting is a century old but the most popular process in extracting fine bast fibers. However, selection of these retting processes depends on the availability of water and the cost of retting process. To extract fine fibers from jute plant, a small stalk is harvested for pre-retting. Usually, this small stalk is brought before 2 weeks of harvesting time. If the fiber can easily be removed from the Jute hurd or core, then the crop is ready for harvesting. After harvesting, the jute stalks are tied into bundles and submerged in soft running water. The stalk stays submerged in water for 20 days. However, the retting process may require less time if the quality of the jute is better. In most cases, the fiber extraction process of bast fibers in water retting is done by the farmers while standing under water. When the jute stalk is well retted, the stalk is grabbed in bundles and hit with a long wooden hammer to make the fiber loose from the jute hurd or core. After loosing the fiber, the fiber is washed with water and squeezed for dehydration. The extracted fibers is further washed with fresh water and allowed to dry on bamboo poles. Finally, they are tied into small bundles to be sold into the primary market. Major producers  The Ganges delta contributes more than 80% of the jute production in the world. The Ganges delta can be sub-divided into the following geo- graphical regions in terms of jute cultivation: * Jat Area (Brahmaputra Alluvium): This comprises part of the districts of Dhaka, Mymensingh, Tangail, and Comilla of Bangladesh. The area annually receives fresh deposit of silts carried down by the flood water. Soils are acidic in, the texture varies from sand loam to clay loam. According to commercial quality, the best quality jute, the Jat type, grows in this area. * District Area (Ganges Alluvium): This comprises part of the districts of Kushtia, Jessore, Khulna, Rajshahi, Pabna, and Dhaka of Bangladesh and major portion of West Bengal of India. This area has soil of slight alkaline clay loam to light loam in gray to dark gray color. The type of jute grown in this area is known as District Jute, which is next to Jat Jute in order of quality. The jute fibre grown in this region is further divided into two major varieties, such as: Hard District Jute and Soft District Jute. * Northern Area (Teesta Silt): This comprises part of Dinajpur, Rangpur districts, East Bogra, and Sirajganj of Bangladesh and some parts of North Bihar Purnea and West Bengal of India. The region has sandy soil with low moisture retention capacity. Soil retention is slightly acidic. Northern type of Jute is inferior quality of the three commercial types. =Strengths of major jute producing countries= Jute :- Also gold Golden Fiber India, Bangladesh is second largest [producer followed by china are the three major producers in the cultivation or production of jute fiber. *India has taken advantage of recent improvements in the cultivation of jute to become the largest producer or cultivator of jute in the world. Using advanced production techniques, India also has dominance over the worldwide jute products market. Due to national law to use jute as packaging materials, India is the largest consumer of jute in the world. India is largest producer as well as consumer of Jute. It produced in Alluvial Soil, required High Temperature, high rainfall and humid climate. Jute producing states in India are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya, Assam and Orissa. *Bangladesh is currently the second largest producer of jute fiber, now over taken by India. The Jat Area, popular for highest quality of jute fiber is located in Bangladesh. Therefore, Bangladesh is able to supply the highest quality of jute fiber in the world. However, Bangladesh falls behind its other competitors in applying recent technological advancements. In terms of world export of jute fiber, Bangladesh's share is more than 70%, which makes Bangladesh the largest exporter of jute fiber in the world. *China is the third largest in terms of jute cultivation. Due to China's huge population, the Chinese are not emphasizing the cultivation of jute, as it competes with other necessary crops. Due to modern effective agriculture, they have the highest yield of jute fiber in the world. History In classical antiquity, Pliny recorded that jute plants were used as food in Ancient Egypt. It may have also been cultivated by the Jews in the Near East, which gives the plant its name. For centuries, jute has been an integral part of the culture of East Bengal and some parts of West Bengal, precisely in the southwest of Bangladesh. Since the seventeenth century, the British started trading in jute. During the reign of the British Empire jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and also exported to the southern United States region to bag cotton. It was used in the fishing, construction, art and the arms industry. Initially, due to its texture, it could only be processed by hand until it was discovered in Dundee that by treating it with whale oil, it could be treated by machine. References External links .

It was designed and produced before World War II by Poland's Cipher Bureau for prospective wartime use by Polish military higher commands. History The machine's name derived from the surname initials of Gwido Langer, Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki and Ludomir Danilewicz and / or his younger brother, Leonard Danilewicz.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma (1984), p. 134. It was built in Warsaw, to the Cipher Bureau's specifications, by the AVA Radio Company.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma (1984), p. 212. In anticipation of war, prior to the September 1939 invasion of Poland, two LCDs were sent to France. From spring 1941, an LCD was used by the Polish Team Z at the Polish-, Spanish- and French-manned Cadix radio-intelligence and decryption center at Uz√®s, near France's Mediterranean coast.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma (1984), p. 119. Prior to the machine's production, it had never been subjected to rigorous decryption attempts. Now it was decided to remedy this oversight. In early July 1941, Polish cryptologists Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski received LCD-enciphered messages that had earlier been transmitted to the staff of the Polish Commander-in-Chief, based in London. Breaking the first message, given to the two cryptologists on July 3, took them only a couple of hours. Further tests yielded similar results.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma (1984), pp. 134‚Äì35. Colonel Langer suspended the use of LCD at Cadix. In 1974, Rejewski explained that the LCD had two serious flaws. It lacked a commutator (\\"plugboard\\"), which was one of the strong points of the German military Enigma machine. The LCD's other weakness involved the reflector and wiring. These shortcomings did not imply that the LCD, somewhat larger than the Enigma and more complicated (e.g., it had a switch for resetting to deciphering), was easy to solve. Indeed, the likelihood of its being broken by the German E-Dienst was judged slight. Theoretically it did exist, however.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma (1984), p. 135.

It is situated at the foot of the South Downs. Its neighbours are Storrington, West Chiltington and Arundel. The village is noted for its thatched cottages. A house named \\"The Thatched House\\" is one of the village's few non-thatched houses. One of the attractions is Amberley Working Museum. Amberley has a railway station on the Arun Valley Line, with regular services to Bognor Regis, Portsmouth and London. To the north of the village is the tidal plain of the River Arun, known as Amberley Wild Brooks. The wetland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest which floods in winter and is known for its wildfowl. Amberley Castle is now a hotel. The castle was a fortified manor house next to which is the Norman St Michael's Church. Cultural links William Champion Streatfeild, who became Bishop of Lewes was vicar of Amberley with Houghton from 1897 to 1902. His daughter, the children's novelist Noel Streatfeild, spent part of her childhood there.Bull, Angela. (1984) Noel Streatfeild. London: William Collins Sons & Co Ltd. These may have been the happiest years of her childhood. Arnold Bennett's stay in the village for eight weeks in 1926 is documented in his journals.Hepburn, J. Arnold Bennett and Amberley. Smoke Tree Press (2002) During May‚ÄìJune 1926, he wrote the last two thirds of The Vanguard in 44 days, noting I have never worked more easily than in the last six weeks. He also met John Cowper Powys who walked over the Downs from Burpham to visit him.The Journals, Arnold Bennett ed. F. Swinnerton Penguin Books p.510-514 Frank Swinnerton lived in Cranleigh and had links with Bennett, subsequently selecting and editing his journals. Swinnerton's 1914 novel On the Staircase has a character named Amberley. Arthur Rackham is commemorated in a wall plaque in the churchyard. The lettercutting is by John Skelton. Rackham and his artist wife Edyth lived at Houghton House on the other side of the valley throughout the 1920s. In 1932, the film The Man from Toronto starring Jessie Matthews and Ian Hunter was filmed here. There is a memorial in the churchyard to Edward Stott RA who lived in Amberley from 1889 until he died in 1918. He is noted for his rural scenes, many sketched close to Amberley. His monument has a bust on top carved by the sculptor Francis Derwent Wood. Wood's grave is marked with one of his own works, a pieta in bronze. Inside the church is a semi-circular stained glass window to Stott, designed by Robert Anning Bell. Other windows have inscriptions by Eric Gill and his assistant Joseph Cribb. In the church, south of the chancel arch are 12th or 13th century wall-paintings, depicting scenes from the Passion Cycle. Amberley Working Museum was used as a set location for the James Bond film A View to a Kill as \\"Mainstrike Mine\\". The village's name was Michael Jupp's inspiration for that of the character Amberley in his TV series The Dreamstone. Local history The Pepper Papers (1899‚Äì1978) give an insight into Amberley's history as a producer of Lime, with 1904 correspondence between Peppers and companies interested in shipping Amberley chalk to North America. In 1929-35, a campaign tried to prevent the despoliation of Amberley by the erection of pylons and overhead power cables, looking at the financing of the alternative scheme of laying low tension underground cables.

The same term is also used to describe the plants on which the bananas grow. They include commercially important cultivars like 'Dwarf Cavendish' (1888) and 'Grand Nain' (the \\"Chiquita banana\\"). Since the 1950s, these cultivars have been the most internationally traded bananas. They replaced the Gros Michel banana (commonly known as Kampala banana in Kenya and Bogoya in Uganda) after it was devastated by Panama disease.  History of cultivation  The 'Super Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar Cavendish bananasDeveloping fruits of a Cavendish banana Cavendish bananas were named after William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. Though they were not the first known banana specimens in Europe, in around 1834 Cavendish received a shipment of bananas (from Mauritius) courtesy of the chaplain of Alton Towers (then the seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury). His head gardener and friend, Sir Joseph Paxton, cultivated them in the greenhouses of Chatsworth House. The plants were botanically described by Paxton as Musa cavendishii, after the Duke. For his work Paxton won a medal at the 1835 Royal Horticultural Society show. The Chatsworth bananas were shipped off to various places in the Pacific around the 1850s. It is believed that some of them may have ended up in the Canary Islands, though other authors believe that the bananas in the Canary Islands had been there since the fifteenth century and had been introduced through other means, namely by early Portuguese explorers who obtained them from West Africa and were later responsible for spreading them to the Caribbean. African bananas in turn were introduced from Southeast Asia into Madagascar by early Austronesian sailors. In 1888, bananas from the Canary Islands were imported into England by Thomas Fyffe. These bananas are now known to belong to the Dwarf Cavendish cultivar. Cavendish bananas entered mass commercial production in 1903 but did not gain prominence until later when Panama disease attacked the dominant Gros Michel (\\"Big Mike\\") variety in the 1950s. Because they were successfully grown in the same soils as previously affected Gros Michel plants, many assumed the Cavendish cultivars were more resistant to Panama disease. Contrary to this notion, in mid-2008, reports from Sumatra and Malaysia suggested that Panama disease had started attacking Cavendish cultivars. After years of attempting to keep it out of the Americas, in mid-2019, Panama disease Tropical Race 4 (TR4), was discovered on banana farms in the coastal Caribbean region. With no fungicide effective against TR4, the Cavendish may meet the same fate as the Gros Michel.  Taxonomy and nomenclature  Cavendish bananas are a subgroup of the triploid (AAA) group cultivars of Musa acuminata. Cavendish cultivars are distinguished by the height of the plant and features of the fruits, and different cultivars may be recognized as distinct by different authorities. The most important clones for fruit production include: 'Dwarf Cavendish', 'Grande Naine', 'Lacatan' (bungulan), 'Poyo', 'Val√©ry', and 'Williams' under one system of cultivar classification. Another classification includes: 'Double', 'Dwarf Cavendish', 'Extra Dwarf Cavendish', 'Grande Naine', 'Pisang Masak Hijau' (syn 'Lacatan'), and 'Giant Cavendish' as a group of several difficult to distinguish cultivars (including 'Poyo', 'Robusta', 'Val√©ry', & 'Williams'). 'Grande Naine' is the most important clone in international trade, while 'Dwarf Cavendish' is the most widely grown clone. 'Grande Naine' is also known as Chiquita banana.  Uses  Cavendish bananas accounted for 47% of global banana production between 1998 and 2000, and the vast majority of bananas entering international trade. The fruits of the Cavendish bananas are eaten raw, used in baking, fruit salads, and to complement foods. The outer skin is partially green when bananas are sold in food markets, and turns yellow when the fruit ripens. As it ripens the starch is converted to sugars turning the fruit sweet. When it reaches its final stage (stage 7), brown/black \\"sugar spots\\" develop. When overripe, the skin turns black and the flesh becomes mushy. Bananas ripen naturally or through an induced process. Once picked they can turn yellow on their own provided that they are fully mature by the time they are being harvested, or can be exposed to ethylene gas to induce ripening. Bananas which are turning yellow emit natural ethylene which is characterized by the emission of sweet scented Esters. Most retailers sell bananas in stages 3‚Äì6, with stage 5‚Äì7 being the most ideal for immediate consumption. The PLUs used for Cavendish bananas are 4011 (yellow) and 4186 (small yellow). Organic Cavendish bananas are assigned PLU 94011. Due to their phallic shape, they are sometimes used in sexual education classes to demonstrate the correct usage of a condom.Wight, Daniel, and Charles Abraham. \\"From psycho-social theory to sustainable classroom practice: developing a research-based teacher-delivered sex education programme.\\" Health education research 15.1 (2000): 25-38.  Diseases  Cultivated bananas are parthenocarpic and reproduce through conventional vegetative reproduction rather than through sexual reproduction. Development of disease resistance depends on mutations occurring in the propagation units, and hence evolves more slowly than in seed-propagated crops. The development of resistant varieties has therefore been the only alternative to protect the fruit trees from tropical and subtropical diseases like bacterial wilt and Fusarium wilt, commonly known as Panama disease.

The A283 road runs directly through the village and connects Storrington to Steyning in the east and Pulborough in the west. History Storrington is listed in the Domesday Book as \\"Estorchestone\\", meaning a place well known for storks. A charter to hold a regular market on Wednesdays was granted by Henry IV in 1400, together with permissions for three fairs during the year, on Mayday, Wednesday of Whit week and the Feast of Martin on 11November.Gazetteer of markets and fairs in England and Wales to 1516 Tanning and blacksmithing were also important industries and only in the 20th century did these roles fade away. Rabbit breeding was another significant industry reflected in a number of local place names including 'The Warren', 'Warren Hill', 'Sullington Warren' and 'Warren Croft'. This working/small industry background has however, left little behind architecturally. Nikolaus Pevsner, noted only the small door in Browns Lane, the church, and the Dominican convent known as the Abbey to be historically significant. Community Since 1945 Storrington has expanded with a variety of housing projects which enlarged the village. It is possible to be in open countryside in a few minutes from the town centre when walking towards the downs or one of the commons. Storrington's main supermarket is Waitrose. There are a variety of shops including delicatessens, charity shops, butchers, clothes shops, coffee shops, hardware stores, estate agencies, two banks, restaurants, a museum and a post office and three public houses: The Moon, the Anchor Inn and the White Horse Inn. The nearest large town is Worthing, approximately to the south, followed by Horsham, approximately to the north. Mainline train services are from Pulborough or Amberley. Trains to London take an hour and a quarter and terminate at Victoria. Trains to Gatwick Airport take about 25 minutes. From the village centre there is walking access to the 100-mile-long trail, the South Downs Way. From Chantry Hill or Kithurst Hill there are views across the English Channel to the south and opposite, to the North Downs. On a clear day you can see the Isle of Wight. Kithurst Hill which rises steeply above the village is marked at the summit by a trig point, 699 feet (213m) above sea level. =Sport and leisure= Trig Point Kithurst Hill Sport and leisure facilities include a recreation ground with football and cricket pitches and a leisure centre.

","title":"Caroline Thompson"},{"id":"2823416","text":"Roy Kilner (17 October 1890 ‚Äì 5 April 1928) was an English professional cricketer who played nine Test matches for England between 1924 and 1926. An all-rounder, he played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1911 and 1927. In all first-class matches, he scored 14,707 runs at an average of 30.01 and took 1,003 wickets at an average of 18.45. Kilner scored 1,000 runs in a season ten times and took 100 wickets in a season five times. On four occasions, he completed the double: scoring 1,000 runs and taking 100 wickets in the same season, recognised as a sign of a quality all-rounder. Kilner first played for Yorkshire as a batsman before the First World War, establishing a regular place in the side. After being wounded in the war, he returned in 1919 to a Yorkshire side which was short of bowlers. As a result, Kilner began to practise his bowling to the point where he became highly regarded as a slow left-arm bowler. His aggressive batting and warm personality made him a popular player with both cricketers and spectators. His form brought selection by England in 1924 and a visit to Australia for the Ashes tour of 1924‚Äì25. Although the second most successful bowler of the tour, his bowling subsequently declined in effectiveness, and did not trouble batsmen on good pitches. He was selected during the 1926 Ashes but dropped for the final Test. Kilner went on several coaching trips to India during English winters, and on one of these, in 1928, he contracted an illness; on his return to England, he died aged 37. His funeral was attended by over 100,000 people and there was widespread sadness at his death. Early life Kilner was born on 17 October 1890 in Wombwell, Barnsley, Yorkshire, England, the second son and one of eleven children of Seth Kilner and Mary Alice Washington.Pope, p. 2. His brother Norman also played cricket, representing Yorkshire and Warwickshire. The Kilners attended Wombwell Parish Church and the boys were members of the Church Lads' Brigade.Pope, p. 4. His father and his uncle, Irving Washington, the former Yorkshire player, encouraged him to play cricket from an early age. He showed enough ability to join the local colliery team, Mitchell Main. At the age of 14 in 1904, Kilner reached the Mitchell Main first team. Although selected regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently.Pope, p. 6. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.Pope, pp. 6‚Äì7. First years at Yorkshire =Debut for Yorkshire= After scoring a second century for Mitchell Main at the start of the 1910 season, Kilner was chosen to play for Yorkshire Second XI. In his first season, he took three wickets and had a batting average of 12.50 but continued to do well for Mitchell Main.Pope, pp. 8‚Äì9. For 1911, Yorkshire sent Kilner to play for Harrogate Cricket Club which provided a higher standard of cricket than Mitchell Main: the county had a system whereby promising young players were sent to gain experience in competitive matches for local clubs. Kilner began to record good batting and bowling performances. Although his form for Yorkshire Second XI was more inconsistent, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire that season against Somerset in the County Championship. He scored 0 and 14 and did not bowl. In a further six matches for Yorkshire in 1911, his highest innings was 18 runs, his average with the bat was just 6.66 in ten innings and he did not take any wickets. For Harrogate, he was more successful, with 519 runs and 28 wickets.Pope, p. 10. =Yorkshire regular= Kilner made a good start to 1912 for Yorkshire Second XI, scoring centuries in two consecutive games; in the second he also took twelve wickets for 75 runs.Pope, p. 12. These performances, coupled with continued good form for Harrogate, led to Kilner's recall to the Yorkshire first team in June. He replaced the injured all- rounder George Hirst for a match against Nottinghamshire.Pope, p. 11. On the first morning, Kilner was used as the sixth bowler and proved successful; he finished with four wickets for 66 runs. Although failing to score in the first innings, he came in to bat in the second innings with Yorkshire 133 for four, needing 249 for victory. He shared a partnership of 113 for the fifth wicket and scored 83 not out to take Yorkshire to a five wicket win. This performance kept Kilner in the team for the remainder of the season, even after Hirst's return. He played 23 times for Yorkshire.Pope, p. 14. He scored 570 runs at an average of 22.80 and took 16 wickets at an average of 22.12, figures regarded as respectable for a first full season. Yorkshire won the County Championship that season. Apart from one game in the 1913 season, he ceased playing for Harrogate. In his years there, he scored 967 runs, averaging 38.68, and took 71 wickets at an average of less than ten runs per wicket. In the 1913 season, Kilner scored 1,586 runs at an average of 34.47, which remained his highest seasonal aggregate of runs and placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages. He also took 18 wickets at 25.22. At the end of May and beginning of June, Kilner took part in century partnerships in four consecutive matches, culminating in his maiden first-class century against Leicestershire. During his innings of 104, he hit 18 fours and shared a partnership of 184 in under two hours with his close friend Major Booth, rescuing Yorkshire from 58 for five and taking the score to 300. Throughout the season, he played several valuable innings when Yorkshire were under pressure. His batting was always adventurous and attacking although he often made uncertain starts to his innings and showed impatience. The strength and variety of the Yorkshire bowling attack meant his left-arm spin was not often required.Pope, p. 17. Even so, Yorkshire dropped to second in the Championship. An illness during the winter of 1913‚Äì14 took its toll on Kilner at the start of the 1914 season.Pope, pp. 18‚Äì19. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his uncertain form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages.Pope, p. 21. His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship. First World War The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, while Kilner was playing in that season's Roses Match at Old Trafford. Initially the government requested that cricket should continue, though several cricketers with military obligations, including Yorkshire's captain, Sir Archibald White, were called up immediately. As the fighting started, and casualties began to mount, public opinion turned against the continuation of the season, and Yorkshire's match against Sussex at Hove, which concluded on 1 September, was the last County Championship match until 1919. The newspaper Cricket reported \\"The men's hearts were barely in the game, and the match was given up as a draw at tea.\\" With the suspension of the championship, Kilner and Major Booth enlisted in the army together, joining the Leeds and Bradford \\"Pals\\" in the West Yorkshire Regiment. Kilner trained as a mechanic before being stationed at Colsterdale in North Yorkshire as a corporal.Pope, pp. 21‚Äì22. While on leave in November 1914, Kilner married Annie Campbelljohn‚Äîthe daughter of James Campbelljohn, an engineer‚Äîat Wombwell Parish Church; Booth served as best man. During the war, Annie gave birth to the couple's first child, Roy junior. Kilner was posted with his battalion to Egypt but was forced home with an injury. When he recovered, he was sent to the Western Front in France.Pope, p. 22. During the Battle of the Somme, he was wounded shortly before his battalion engaged in the fighting, receiving a shrapnel wound in the wrist; later in the same action, Booth was killed. Kilner recovered in a military hospital near Blackpool before being assigned to Preston Garrison as a mechanic. Kilner suffered a second loss when his brother Bernard was killed at Ypres in 1917. Having previously played football for Mitchell Main in the winter of 1912‚Äì13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took their place in the First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is unclear how often he represented the club.Pope, p. 25. First-class career after the war =From batsman to bowler= When cricket resumed after the war in 1919, County Championship matches were reduced from three days to two in a one-season experiment. Following the deaths of Booth in the war and Alonzo Drake from illness, as well as the decline in the bowling of the aging George Hirst, Yorkshire lacked an effective attack. Subsequently, Kilner was asked to deliver more overs, although not to the extent of a main bowler.Pope, pp. 26‚Äì27. He took 45 wickets, more than his entire first-class wicket aggregate before the war, at an average of 18.12. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat he scored three centuries and reached 1,135 runs at 29.10. His performances earned him a place in the Gentlemen v Players match at the end of season during the Scarborough Festival, although he neither took a wicket nor scored. Kilner's brother Norman also played for Yorkshire in 1919, although he was ultimately unable to secure a permanent place in the team. alt=A close up of a man in an MCC cap Kilner began the 1920 season with an innings of 206 not out in his first match, against Derbyshire, and the effort remained the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two sixes. He could have been caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his driving and pulling being particularly effective.Pope, p. 28. Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season Scarborough Festival, he played for CI Thornton's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side which visited Australia in the winter‚Äîat the time, the MCC administered English cricket, and the England team toured under its name. In total, he scored 1,316 runs at an average of 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages. With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high.Pope, p. 29. The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners. Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main slow left-arm spinner. Conscious of his increasing age, the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the best option and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin. Consequently, during the winter, Kilner practised bowling in the yard of the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord. Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.Pope, pp. 29‚Äì30. Kilner's bowling had greater success in 1921, helping Yorkshire to rise to third in the Championship. Used more regularly, he took 61 wickets (average 18.80), including his first five-wicket hauls in an innings , against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire. He scored 1,137 runs at an average of 27.73. He made centuries in the two matches against Northamptonshire, sharing big partnerships in both games: 276 with Rhodes in the first and 299 with Percy Holmes in the second.Pope, p. 30. His overall performance left him sixth in the Yorkshire batting averages, and fourth in the bowling averages.The placings for Yorkshire bowling averages include only bowlers who took ten wickets or more and batsmen who played ten innings. Through the winter, he continued to develop his bowling. =Established all-rounder= By 1922, Kilner's bowling had improved to the point where he passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, taking 122 at an average of 14.72, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship. Wisden recognised this was the first season when he was a front-line bowler, \\"[leaving] his previous form far behind.\\" In the first five games of the campaign, he took 21 wickets for 142 runs.Pope, p. 32. In the match against Essex, he claimed ten wickets in a match for the first time, taking eleven for 51 runs. Against Hampshire, he took ten wickets for 90 runs, including six for 13 in the second innings as Hampshire were bowled out for 44. At the same time, he maintained his batting form, having a similar record to the previous season. He scored 1,198 runs at 27.22 and scored two centuries. This meant he completed the double‚Äîregarded as the sign of a quality all-round cricketer‚Äîfor the first time.Pope, p. 33. Kilner was fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages and fourth in the bowling averages. At the end of the season, he was again selected for CI Thornton's XI, as well as in two games at Eastbourne. Over the English winter, Kilner accepted a job coaching for the Maharaja of Patiala in India. He played in several first-class matches, and enjoyed himself enough to return the following winter. Statistically, Kilner's peak as a bowler came in the 1923 season, when he took 158 wickets at an average of 12.90 and finished second in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat, he failed to score a hundred for the first time since 1912, but still made 1,401 runs at 34.17 and including nine scores over fifty. This placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages, his contributions helping his team to retain the County Championship. He made a very effective start to the season, taking 27 wickets in the first four matches for just 157 runs,Pope, p. 34. including the best figures of his career, eight for 26 against Glamorgan, and six for 14 against Middlesex. Later that season against Surrey, he performed what was regarded by Wisden as one of his best bowling feats. Surrey needed 184 runs to win and seemed certain winners when they had scored 127 for two. After Emmott Robinson took a wicket, Kilner took the last five for only 15 runs in a match-winning performance. He finished with bowling figures of six for 22 and took ten wickets in the match. He had been under the impression that Surrey had only needed seven runs (rather than the 27 they required) to win at the end, and his teammates remembered he was pale with effort and concentration. In the same season, Kilner was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's Cricket Ground, the most prestigious such fixture at the time, where he scored eight in his only innings and took three wickets.Pope, p. 35. Wisden commented that he seemed certain to be picked for the England Test match side shortly (there were no Tests played that summer). He took a step towards this when he was selected for a Test trial match, scoring 26 and 11 not out, but only bowling 18 overs in the match to take two wickets. He also made another appearance for the Players, this time at Scarborough. His performances in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden's Bowlers of the Year. Test match career =Test debut= After another winter coaching in India and practising his bowling,Pope, p. 38. Kilner took 145 first-class wickets at 13.28 during the 1924 English summer, placing him second in the national averages behind his teammate George Macaulay.Pope, p. 40. His batting suffered a decline; he scored 731 runs at 20.88, the lowest aggregate of his career and his first sub-1,000 total since 1912. Kilner took 33 wickets in the first six matches of the season, and his form earned selection for a Test trial match.Pope, p. 39. In this game, he took three for 49 in the first innings and a further wicket in the second but only scored 20 runs in two innings. After 19 wickets in his next three matches, including seven in the match against the South African touring side, he was awarded a place in the England team for the first Test. In his maiden Test, he scored 59 out of a large total, batting at number seven. South Africa were dismissed for 30 runs in the first innings before Kilner had an opportunity to bowl. In the second innings, he delivered 22 overs without taking a wicket and commentators were not impressed by his bowling. The selectors left Kilner out of the next two Tests, all-rounder J. W. Hearne taking his place, but he played in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. He scored a rapid 113‚Äîhis only century of the season‚Äîfor the Players. By lunch on the last day, the Gentlemen had followed-on but were well placed to secure a draw with the score at 112 for three. Kilner settled the match by taking quick wickets and ending the innings with figures of six for 20 as the Players won by an innings.Pope, pp. 39‚Äì40. Kilner was recalled for Hearne in the fourth Test, but rain prevented all play after the first day. He bowled 12 wicketless overs, meaning he had not dismissed anyone in his first two Tests and he did not play in the last Test as Hearne returned. For Yorkshire, he had a more successful time, three times taking ten wickets in a match, including twelve for 55 in the final championship match of the season, which Yorkshire had to win to have a chance of winning the title. Yorkshire's opponents, Sussex, were bowled out twice for less than 100, and when other results went Yorkshire's way, the club were crowned champions for the third successive year. Kilner was chosen for the Players again in an end of season match at Scarborough. Although his poor batting meant his form as an all-rounder was disappointing, he had a very good season as a bowler. Nevertheless, his selection to tour Australia that winter with the MCC team surprised commentators. =Tour of Australia= alt=A cricketer bowling Playing for MCC under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan, Kilner made 103 against Western Australia on his maiden first-class appearance in Australia. He continued to show good all-round form in the less important, non first-class matches, but in first-class matches leading up to the Tests he was less successful. Kilner passed fifty runs just once after his century and with the ball took one wicket in 81 overs during seven innings. He did not play in the first two Test matches, both of which were lost by England, but was selected for the third when the selectors altered the bowling attack. During the match, a series of injuries to colleagues left Kilner with a heavy workload. Australia batted first and scored 489, a total which looked unlikely when they lost three wickets for 22 and later six wickets for 119. England's pace bowlers, Gilligan and Maurice Tate, had to leave the field injured, allowing Australia to recover; later the spinner Tich Freeman hurt his wrist and could not bowl. The only fit front-line bowlers remaining were Kilner and Frank Woolley. England fielded for nearly nine hours, and Kilner bowled 56 eight-ball overs to take four for 127, his first wicket in Test matches being Arthur Richardson. Given the injuries, Gilligan later said Kilner gave \\"a truly great performance\\".Pope, p. 41. England could not match Australia's total, scoring only 365, but when the hosts batted again, rain fell and affected the pitch, making it responsive to spin bowling. Australia lost their last seven wickets for 39 runs in an hour and Kilner took four for 14 in his final spell of bowling to end with four for 51. Needing 375 to win, Kilner scored 24 but England fell just short to lose by 11 runs. Consequently, Australia took an unbeatable 3‚Äì0 series lead. Between the third and fourth matches in the series, Kilner recorded good bowling performances, with five for 35 against Tasmania and match figures of ten for 66 against Victoria, and kept his place for the final two Tests. In the fourth Test, which England won comfortably, Kilner scored 79, his highest Test score, adding 133 with Dodger Whysall, the largest partnership of the match. When Australia batted, Kilner took five wickets in the match and stood out as one of the best bowlers. In the final Test, Kilner took four for 97 in Australia's first innings, but could not prevent the home team's fourth victory of the series. Kilner finished the series with 129 runs and averaged 29.80, batting mainly at number eight in the order, and Wisden noted he scored runs when they were needed. In the Tests, he captured 17 wickets at an average of 23.47. Wisden noted that no-one but Kilner could take wickets to support Tate, the most successful bowler. Apart from these two, no other bowler could manage more than 11 wickets and the other main bowlers averaged around 50. In all first-class matches, Kilner scored 488 runs at 24.88 and took 40 wickets at 25.17. Final seasons =Decline as a bowler= During 1925, Kilner was awarded a benefit match and had an improved batting record for the season but critics began to notice a decline in his bowling. He was effective on pitches which favoured spin bowlers, but not on the flatter pitches prevalent in the dry summer of 1925.Woodhouse, p. 338. Cricket journals, such as The Cricketer, criticised his tendency to bowl leg theory‚Äîa tactic regarded as negative and overly defensive‚Äîwhen confronted with batting-friendly conditions.Pope, p. 43. He took 131 wickets at 17.92, finishing second in the Yorkshire averages and helping his team to their fourth successive County Championship. He scored 1,068 runs at an average of 30.51 with two centuries. This gave him the third double of his career. Kilner's popularity with the crowds peaked in 1925, when over three days, 71,000 people attended his benefit match against Middlesex. It raised ¬£4,106 (the equivalent of around ¬£175,000 in 2008), to set a new record for benefit proceeds.Pope, p. 45. There were no Test matches in 1925, but Kilner was once again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, scoring 59 in his only innings and taking five wickets in the match, as well as some end of season matches for the MCC's team from the previous winter. In the winter of 1925‚Äì26, Kilner was selected for the MCC tour of the West Indies, during which no Test matches were played. It was not personally successful for him and he recorded few effective performances. He scored 249 runs in first-class matches at 22.63, with just one score over fifty, and took 34 wickets at 29.50. Yorkshire's run of success ended in 1926 as fierce rivals Lancashire relegated them into second place. Kilner had some successful matches in the season and achieved at a consistent level, but his performance showed signs of deteriorating.Pope, p. 47. He scored 1,187 runs at 37.09, the highest seasonal average of his career. He completed the double for the fourth and final time by taking 107 wickets, but his bowling average of 22.52 was his worst since 1920, before he became a regular bowler. He finished sixth in the Yorkshire batting and third in the bowling averages. He played for the Players for the final time at Lord's, scoring 72, but failed to take a wicket. His final first-class century came against Middlesex, when he compiled 150 out of a total of 415, dominating the scoring while he was at the crease. During the summer's Ashes series, he was selected for the first four Tests. He only batted twice with a highest score of 36. With the ball, he took seven wickets at 39.42, but the editor of Wisden criticised much of the English bowling; he described Kilner's only notable achievement as quickly ending Australia's innings in the second Test at Lord's. For the final Test, Kilner was dropped in favour of 48-year-old Wilfred Rhodes. According to the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, Rhodes was recalled because of the lack of an effective alternative left-arm spinner. Rhodes had a successful match and England defeated Australia to win the Ashes for the first time since 1912, but Kilner had played his last Test. In nine Tests, he scored 233 runs at an average of 33.28 and took 24 wickets at 30.58. Over the winter of 1926‚Äì27, Kilner declined an invitation to tour India by the MCC.Pope, p. 48. The 1927 season, which proved to be Kilner's last, was his least effective for several years and a disappointing summer for Yorkshire. The county fell to third in the Championship behind Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He failed to achieve a century, scoring 1,004 runs (average 33.46), and did not reach 100 wickets for the first time since 1921, taking just 86 wickets at an average of 23.68. Wisden said his bowling had lost its effectiveness and was no longer dangerous even when the pitch was helpful to spinners. In the Yorkshire averages, he finished fifth in both batting and bowling. In Kilner's final County Championship match, he scored 91 not out and took eight wickets, including five for 21 in the second innings, helping Yorkshire to a nine wicket victory. In his final first-class match, for Yorkshire against MCC, Kilner scored an unbeaten 51 to guide Yorkshire to an eight wicket win. He ended his first- class career with 14,707 runs at an average of 30.01 and 1,003 wickets at an average of 18.45. =Death= The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to play and coach in India in the winter of 1927‚Äì28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very reluctant to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting.Pope, p. 50. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire teammates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed.Pope, pp. 51‚Äì52 He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in the first few days of April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.Pope, p. 52. The town of Wombwell expressed enormous sympathy and tributes came from around the world. When Kilner's funeral took place on 10 April, the streets were packed with mourners. Many came from outside the town, and according to contemporary estimates 100,000 people were present to pay tribute to Kilner; there may have been more.Pope, p. 54. Over a thousand people were at the cemetery for the burial, and Yorkshire cricketers carried the coffin.Pope, pp. 54‚Äì55 Two years later, the Australian team which toured England in 1930 visited Kilner's grave in Wombwell to lay a wreath.Pope, pp. xiii, 57. The rector at the funeral said in his tribute: \\"A Yorkshire wicket has fallen and one of Yorkshire's best men is out; and we lament his loss; not merely because it is the loss of a great cricketer, but because it is the loss of such a cricketer as Roy Kilner was.\\" Style and personality alt=A cricketer hitting the ball Kilner first came into the Yorkshire side as a batsman. He was considered a good, reliable batsman when he began, although his style was regarded by Yorkshire critics as unorthodox to the point where they disapproved of some of his unusual, eccentric shots.Hodgson, p. 92. For Yorkshire, he appeared high in the order, but batted between number seven and number nine for England. If the circumstances of the game demanded it, he was able to play slowly and defensively and restrain his naturally aggressive style. He was particularly effective while playing the drive and pull shot. For most of his career, his effectiveness as a batsman was not compromised by his improvement and increasing workload as a bowler. In terms of bowling, Kilner was an effective performer on rain affected pitches. His accuracy also enabled him to bowl on good pitches without the batsmen being able to score too many runs. In 1923, journalist Alfred Pullin said Kilner spun the ball more than any other English bowler. He noted, as did Wisden, how Kilner often bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets, unusual for a left-arm spinner in this period. This established a contrast with his fellow left-arm spinner, Wilfred Rhodes, and increased their effectiveness. Furthermore, it allowed him to surprise batsmen with a different delivery, such as one which did not turn.Pope, pp. 35‚Äì36. Kilner's Wisden portrait also credited him with the gift of imagination, describing how he always tried to think of new ways to beat and dismiss batsmen. He would experiment with his bowling, for example altering his pace slightly, if conditions were unfavourable towards bowlers. Kilner delivered left-arm wrist spin at times, constantly practising it in the cricket nets. His brother Norman believed Roy was the person who coined the term \\"chinaman\\" to describe such a style, although other players have also claimed to originate the phrase. At a time when the Yorkshire team was successful but exhibited a grim and determined attitude, Kilner was very popular with spectators. They liked him for his cheerfulness and desire to entertain, an attitude not shared by all of his teammates. He had many friends in the game at a time when Yorkshire were not always welcome in other counties due to their on-field attitude. When he was chosen as a Bowler of the Year in 1924, Wisden remarked that he was devoted to the game, possessed a cheery temperament and stood out among players for his personality, while his obituary described him as modest and generous. His Times obituary described him as \\"not only a notable exponent of the game, but a man of rare charm. Few modern professionals commanded such a measure of esteem and kindly regard from his own immediate colleagues and his opponents in the cricket field as did Roy Kilner\\". Kilner was a favourite of cricket writer Neville Cardus, who attributed several sayings to him in his prose. For example, Cardus described Kilner as saying about Yorkshire and Lancashire matches at the time: \\"What we want is no umpires and fair cheating all round\\", and \\"We say good morning and after that all we say is 'Howzat?'\\"Hodgson, p. 93. Also, when asked about contemporary problems in the game, in particular the negative attitude of some teams, he replied the game was fine, it was \\"t'crowd that wants educating up to it.\\" Notes References Bibliography  External links 1890 births 1928 deaths England Test cricketers Wisden Cricketers of the Year Yorkshire cricketers Europeans cricketers People from Wombwell English cricketers Players cricketers Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers North v South cricketers Deaths from typhoid fever English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 C.

He served as a chancellor of the Tang dynasty for about 13 years during the reign of Emperor Taizong. He was also the lead editor of the official history of the Sui dynasty, the Book of Sui, which was composed in 636. Wei Zheng was born to a poor family in modern Hebei, and joined Li Mi's rebellion against the Sui dynasty in his youth. After Li Mi's submission to the Tang Empire, Wei Zheng became a Tang official and eventually served on the staff of Li Jiancheng, the Crown Prince and eldest son of Emperor Gaozu, the Tang dynasty's founding emperor. As such, he served against the interests of Li Jiancheng's younger brother, Li Shimin (the Prince of Qin), with whom Li Jiancheng was locked in an intense rivalry. In 626, Li Shimin ambushed and killed Li Jiancheng, and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him. Rather than punishing Wei Zheng, however, he was impressed with Wei's faithfulness to Li Jiancheng, and he made Wei an important official, eventually a chancellor. Wei Zheng's promotion to this position gave him far broader freedom to criticise others, particularly the emperor, than other officers of the court. He emphasized propriety and opposed overextending the state. His advice and criticism were not always accepted, but in accordance with Confucian etiquette, the emperor would concede to his suggestions with some regularity. After Wei Zheng's death in 643, the emperor commented that he was a mirror to show the mistakes of the court, and built an elaborate tomb for him near his own imperial tomb and betrothed one of his daughters, Princess Hengshan, to Wei Shuyu (), Wei Zheng's son. Subsequently, as a result of false accusations made by others in the court, the stone monument that Emperor Taizong had built for Wei Zheng was destroyed, and Emperor Taizong cancelled the planned marriage between Princess Hengshan and Wei Shuyu. However, after the failure of the campaign against Goguryeo in 646, Emperor Taizong, believing that Wei Zheng would have stopped him from going on the campaign had he lived longer, restored the stone monument. Wei Zheng's effect and influence has been examined by many historians long after his death. Wei Zheng is also revered as a minor god of doorways in parts of Taiwan.  Background  Wei Zheng was born in 580, shortly before the founding of Sui Dynasty in 581. His family was from Julu Commandery (ÈâÖÈπø, roughly modern Xingtai, Hebei). His father Wei Changxian () was a county magistrate during Northern Qi. Wei lost his father early in life and was poor, but had great expectations, not caring about making wealth. At one point, he became a Taoist monk. He favored studying, and as he saw that the rule of Emperor Yang of Sui was beginning to make Sui fall into a state of confusion, he particularly paid attention to strategic works.  Service under Li Mi  At the end of Emperor Yang's reign, there were many rebellions against Sui rule. One of the major ones was led by Li Mi the Duke of Wei. In 617, the secretary general of Wuyang Commandery (Ê≠¶ÈôΩ, part of modern Handan, Hebei), Yuan Baozang (), rebelled against Sui as well and submitted to Li Mi. He invited Wei Zheng to serve on his staff, as his secretary. Wei subsequently drafted submissions from Yuan to Li Mi, suggesting that Li Mi attack and seize nearby Wei Commandery (È≠èÈÉ°, also part of modern Handan) and a large food storage that Emperor Yang built, Liyang Storage (ÈªéÈôΩÂÄâ, in modern Hebi, Henan). Li Mi was impressed, and when he found out that Wei wrote the submissions, he requested Yuan send Wei to him. He subsequently made Wei his secretary. In 618, Li Mi was ready for a major confrontation with the Sui general Wang Shichong, who had seized power at the eastern capital Luoyang as the regent to Sui's last emperor Yang Tong (Emperor Yang's grandson). Wei spoke with Li Mi's secretary general Zheng Ting (), advocating that Li Mi take a defensive stance, refusing to engage Wang and draining Wang's food supplies. Zheng rejected the proposal, and the proposal apparently was never submitted to Li Mi. Subsequently, when Li Mi engaged Wang, Wang defeated him. Believing that he could no longer hold out against Wang, Li Mi fled to Tang Dynasty territory and surrendered to Emperor Gaozu of Tang. Wei followed him to Tang territory. Subsequently, with Li Mi's major general Xu Shiji (later known as Li Shiji) still holding the Liyang region, Wei requested that Emperor Gaozu send him to Liyang to persuade Xu to submit to Tang as well. Xu did so.  Emperor Gaozu's reign  In spring 619, with Yuan Baozang being attacked by Yuwen Huaji the Emperor of Xu (who had led the coup that killed Emperor Yang in 618), Wei went to Yuan to persuade him to submit to Tang. Yuan did so. Wei apparently subsequently went back to Liyang. In winter 619, when Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, one of Tang's major rivals, attacked and captured Liyang, Wei was among the people captured by Dou, along with Emperor Gaozu's cousin Li Shentong () the Prince of Huai'an, Emperor Gaozu's sister Princess Tong'an, and Li Shiji's father Li Gai (). (Li Shiji was not captured, but several days later felt compelled to surrender to Dou as well, as his father had become a captive.) Dou made Wei his secretary. In 621, Dou, while trying to aid Wang, under siege at Luoyang by the Tang general Li Shimin the Prince of Qin (Emperor Gaozu's son), was defeated and captured by Li Shimin. The Xia officials initially fled back to the Xia capital Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan as well) subsequently decided to surrender, and Wei followed Pei Ju back to the Tang capital Chang'an. Emperor Gaozu's oldest son Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince had long heard of Wei's talents, and he invited Wei to serve as his librarian. In 622, with Dou's general Liu Heita having risen against Tang and captured most of former Xia territory, Wei and another staff member, Wang Gui, suggested to Li Jiancheng that due to Li Shimin's accomplishments and fame, he posed a threat to Li Jiancheng, and that Li Jiancheng needed some victories of his own‚Äîindicating that he should volunteer to attack Liu. Li Jiancheng agreed, and later in 622 crushed Liu's forces. (Liu was betrayed by his own subordinate Zhuge Dewei () in early 623 and turned over to Li Jiancheng; Li Jiancheng killed him.) As the brothers' rivalry intensified over the year, Wei repeatedly suggested to Li Jiancheng that he must act first and kill Li Shimin. Li Jiancheng could not resolve to do so. In 626, however, Li Shimin, believing that Li Jiancheng would kill him, ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, at Xuanwu Gate, killing them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince. He summoned Wei and rebuked him, \\"Why did you alienate us brothers?\\" Wei's colleagues were all fearful for him, but Wei, instead of begging for forgiveness, stated boldly, \\"If the Crown Prince had listened to my words, he would not have suffered this disaster.\\" Li Shimin, who had been impressed with Wei himself, was further impressed by the answer, and he changed his attitude and treated Wei with respect, inviting Wei to serve on his own staff. Subsequently, when he sent Wei on a mission to pacify the eastern prefectures, Wei, believing that no one would believe Li Shimin's words that Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's staff members would be spared if some of them, then under arrest, were not released, ordered them released‚Äîan act that Li Shimin was pleased with and impressed by. Later in 626, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin (as Emperor Taizong). Wei continued to serve in the imperial administration.  Emperor Taizong's reign  After Emperor Taizong took the throne, he created Wei the Baron of Julu. Later in 626, when Emperor Taizong buried Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji with honors due imperial princes, Wei Zheng and Wang Gui requested permission to attend the funeral procession. Emperor Taizong agreed, and further ordered that all officials who served on Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's staffs to attend the funeral procession. It was said that when Emperor Taizong first took the throne, he was looking for ways to improve his reign. As he believed that Wei had great abilities in governance, he often invited Wei into his own bedroom to converse with him. Wei had the fortitude to speak up for what he saw to be right, and Emperor Taizong often gladly accepted his suggestions. In 627, when it was rumored that Feng Ang (), a former Sui official who had submitted to Tang several years prior, had started a rebellion, and Emperor Taizong wanted to send forces to attack Feng, Wei advised against it, pointing out that Feng did not advance outside his own territories and appeared to be simply fearful that he had been accused of treason. Under Wei's suggestion, Emperor Taizong sent the official Li Gongyan () to comfort Feng; Feng then showed his submission by sending his son Feng Zhidai () to follow Li Gongyan to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Taizong. Pleased, Emperor Taizong stated, \\"Wei had me send a messenger, and as a result the Lingnan region was pacified, better than if 100,000 men were sent. He must receive an award.\\" He awarded Wei with silk. Around that time, he also made Wei a deputy head of the Department of State Affairs. Later that year, Wei was accused of nepotism. Emperor Taizong had the imperial censor Wen Yanbo investigate, and Wen found no evidence of wrongdoing. Wen nevertheless stated to Emperor Taizong, \\"Wei did not care about public perception or appearance of conflict of interest. Even though he had no wrongful intent, he should still be rebuked.\\" Emperor Taizong agreed and rebuked Wei, but Wei bluntly refused to accept the rebuke, and Emperor Taizong later retracted the rebuke after concluding that Wei was correct. Throughout the rest of Wei's career, this became a pattern‚Äîthat Wei would dare to speak against the emperor's opinions or acts despite Emperor Taizong's anger, and while Emperor Taizong did not accept everything that Wei said, he always treated Wei with respect. In 629, Emperor Taizong made Wei the head of the Palace Library, but gave him the additional designation Canyu Chaozheng (), making him a de facto chancellor. Later that year, when the assistant censor Quan Wanji () accused the chancellors Fang Xuanling and Wang Gui of improper selection of officials, Emperor Taizong initially ordered Hou Junji to investigate. Wei, however, pointed out that both Fang and Wang were trusted officials who should be given free rein and not have the details of their acts be picked on. Emperor Taizong agreed and cancelled the investigations. In 630, the general Li Jing had inflicted a heavy blow to the forces of Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi, and later that year, after Ashina Duobi was captured, Eastern Tujue chieftains submitted to Tang. Emperor Taizong requested opinions on what to do with Eastern Tujue's people. There were many different opinions, but the two opinions that Emperor Taizong appeared to consider the most were the ones by Wen and Wei, who debated extensively before Emperor Taizong. Wen argued that, pursuant to precedents of what Eastern Han Dynasty did with the Xiongnu, the Eastern Tujue people should be placed within Tang borders but organized in tribal form, to serve as a defense perimeter on the northern border. Wei advocated that the Eastern Tujue people be placed north of Tang borders, believing that they would pose a threat if placed within Tang borders. Wen, however, argued that the Eastern Tujue people could eventually be assimilated and become an asset to the Tang state, and Emperor Taizong agreed with Wen. He established 10 prefectures to settle the Eastern Tujue people and made the major chieftains the prefects, while inviting a number of Eastern Tujue nobles to serve as generals at Chang'an. Late in 630, Qu Wentai (), the king of Gaochang, was set to arrive at Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Taizong. When the other Xiyu states heard this, they wanted to send emissaries as well, and Emperor Taizong initially ordered Qu's official Yanda Gegan () back to Gaochang to gather the emissaries to lead them to Chang'an. Wei advised against doing so‚Äîpointing out that if that happened, Tang would become deeply involved in Xiyu matters, and that the Tang state was not yet in a position of doing so. Emperor Taizong agreed and ordered Yanda to stop. In 631, despite Wei's advice against it, Emperor Taizong began setting up a feudal scheme where the great contributors to Tang rule would be granted posts as prefectural prefects, to be inherited by their descendants. (Subsequently, however, due to other officials' opposition‚Äîthe strongest of which came from Emperor Taizong's brother-in-law Zhangsun Wuji‚ÄîEmperor Taizong cancelled the feudal scheme.) In 632, at the urgings of many officials who believed that he should go to Mount Tai to pay homage to heaven and earth (known as Fengshan), Emperor Taizong considered doing so, but Wei opposed, and this led to a famous conversation between them, which showcased Wei's personal philosophy against overextending the state: > Emperor Taizong asked, \\"You oppose my conducting of Fengshan. Is it that my > accomplishments were not great enough?\\" Wei responded, \\"They are great > enough.\\" Emperor Taizong asked, \\"Is it that my virtues were not great > enough?\\" Wei responded, \\"They are great enough.\\" Emperor Taizong asked, \\"Is > it that China is not pacified enough?\\" Wei responded, \\"It is pacified > enough.\\" Emperor Taizong asked, \\"Is it that the barbaric nations have not > submitted to me?\\" Wei responded, \\"They have.\\" Emperor Taizong asked, \\"Is it > that we have not had good harvests?\\" Wei responded, \\"We have had good > harvests.\\" Emperor Taizong asked, \\"Is it that signs of blessings have not > occurred?\\" Wei responded, \\"They have.\\" Emperor Taizong asked, \\"Then, why is > it that I still cannot conduct Fengshan?\\" > Wei responded, \\"Even though Your Imperial Majesty has accomplished these six > achievements, we are still inheriting the state left after the great > confusion at the end of Sui rule. The population is greatly reduced and has > not recovered. The food stores are still empty. When Your Imperial Majesty > heads east [to Mount Tai], the thousands of horses and wagons require > supplies everywhere they go, and it is difficult for the local government to > do so. In addition, at Fengshan, the rulers and chiefs of the nations should > all attend you. However, from the Yi and Luo Rivers to the Sea and Mount Dai > [(Â≤±Â±±, another name for Mount Tai)], there are still few villages and few > people. The weeds grow thickly without end, and this would be inviting > barbarians to our abdomen and showing them our weaknesses. Further, even if > we greatly reward them, they would not necessarily be pleased, having come > from afar. Even if you exempt the people from taxes for many years, you > still cannot compensate them for their losses. Why would Your Imperial > Majesty want to simply hold a great Fengshan ceremony but receive real > detriments?\\" Incidentally, at that time, many prefectures around the Yellow River were suffering floods, so Emperor Taizong gave up the idea. Around the same time, there was an incident when Emperor Taizong visited his summer palace Jiucheng Palace (‰πùÊàêÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). He sent some of his servants back to Chang'an, and they were staying at the official lodges at Weichuan County (ÊπãÂ∑ù, also in modern Baoji), when the chancellors Li Jing and Wang Gui arrived. The county officials displaced the imperial servants to house Li and Wang. When Emperor Taizong heard this, he felt disrespected, and initially were going to punish the county officials. Wei disagreed, pointing out that Li and Wang were far more important and honored than the imperial servants. Emperor Taizong relented and did not punish the county officials, Li, or Wang. Emperor Taizong was about to marry the Princess Changle to Zhangsun Wuji's son Zhangsun Chong (). As the princess was born of Empress Zhangsun and was his favorite daughter, Emperor Taizong ordered that her dowry had to exceed that for his sister, the Princess Yongjia. Wei advised against it, pointing out that this was contrary to Emperor Ming of Han's observation that his sons should not be as honored as his brothers. Emperor Taizong agreed and also informed Empress Zhangsun, who was greatly impressed with Wei's honest advice, and therefore, after receiving permission from Emperor Taizong, she had her eunuchs send rewards of money and silk to Wei, praising him for his honesty. On another occasion, after Emperor Taizong returned from an imperial gathering, he was angry and yelled, \\"Let me find a chance to kill this farmer!\\" Empress Zhangsun asked whom he was referring to, and he replied, \\"I am referring to Wei Zheng. He always find a way to insult me in front of everyone in the imperial hall!\\" Empress Zhangsun retreated to her bedchambers and put on the official empress gown; standing solemnly, she prepared to bow to Emperor Taizong. He was surprised, and asked her what the reason was. She responded, \\"I have heard that only a most able emperor will have subordinates who have integrity. Wei shows this much integrity because you are an able emperor. How can I not congratulate you?\\" Emperor Taizong's anger turned to happiness, and he did not punish Wei. Soon, Wei was created a duke. Later that year, there was an occasion when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, \\"Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before. I did not know at the time that we would get the chance to feast together.\\" Emperor Taizong responded, \\"Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. Why?\\" Wei responded, \\"I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. That is why I spoke no further.\\" Emperor Taizong responded, \\"You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. What harm is there?\\" Wei responded, \\"It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. That is not how Houji (ÂêéÁ®∑) and Ziqi (Â≠êÊ£Ñ, both legendary great officials during Emperor Shun's reign) served Emperor Shun.\\" Emperor Taizong laughed and stated, \\"Everyone says that Wei is arrogant and careless, but I call him 'delicate'; this shows it.\\" In 633, after Wang was accused of leaking palace secrets, Emperor Taizong made Wei Shizhong () -- the head of the examination bureau of government and a chancellor post‚Äîto replace Wang. At that time, there were also a large backlog of legal matters being handled by the executive bureau, and Emperor Taizong temporarily assigned Wei to handle them. It was said that while Wei did not study law, he reasoned logically, and he was able to make proper decisions. In 634, when Emperor Taizong wanted to send officials to visit the circuits to see how the people were doing in the provinces, Li Jing recommended Wei. Emperor Taizong, however, responded, \\"Wei needs to point out my faults, and I cannot let him go.\\" Instead, he sent 13 officials, including Li Jing and Xiao Yu, out to the circuits for this mission. Emperor Taizong had commissioned the compilation of several official histories of Tang's predecessor dynasties‚Äîcommissioning Linghu Defen and Cen Wenben to compile the Book of Zhou (Northern Zhou's history); Kong Yingda and Xu Jingzong to compile the Book of Sui (Sui Dynasty's history); Yao Silian to compile the Book of Liang (Liang Dynasty's history) and Book of Chen (Chen Dynasty's history); and Li Baiyao to compile the Book of Northern Qi (Northern Qi's history). Wei was in charge of writing commentaries on a number of important persons whose biographies were contained in these histories, and after the histories were completed around 636, Emperor Taizong awarded him silk and upgraded his title to Duke of Zheng. (For reasons unclear, Wei was given credit as the lead editor of the Book of Sui, but not the other works.) Also in 636, Wei tried to resign on account of eye illnesses. Emperor Taizong relieved him from his post as Shizhong and gave him the honorific post of Tejin (), but still gave him full authority as if he were still Shizhong. He also continued to designate him Canyi Deshi (), keeping him as a de facto chancellor. By this point, Emperor Taizong had begun to favor his son Li Tai over his oldest son and crown prince Li Chengqian. When accusations were made that the high-level officials were disrespectful to Li Tai, Emperor Taizong was initially angry, rebuking the high-level officials. However, Wei responded that those high- level officials should, in fact, be more honored than the imperial princes, as the state's key personnel, and Emperor Taizong, seeing that Wei was correct, apologized. In 637, a new code of rites, coauthored by Wei and Fang, was completed. Also in 637, Wei submitted a petition containing a number of advice for Emperor Taizong to continuously examine himself. This petition was later titled the Petition on Ten Thoughts ()Petition on Ten Thoughts. and became a famous document often held up as examples of how officials should advise the emperor. In 638, there was yet another incident where Wang, by then the minister of ceremonies, suggested that high-level officials should not have to yield to imperial princes when their processions meet. Emperor Taizong initially saw this as an insult to the imperial princes‚Äîparticularly Li Tai, whom he was secretly considering replacing Li Chengqian with‚Äîand he made the statement, \\"Life is uncertain. If the Crown Prince should die early, how do you know that one of the princes would not be your lord in the future. How can you disrespect them?\\" Wei, seeing what was happening, spoke bluntly, \\"Ever since Zhou Dynasty, succession is always from father to son, not to brothers, to prevent plotting by younger sons and stop infighting at their origin. This is what the rulers need to be careful about.\\" Emperor Taizong thereafter approved Wang's proposal. In 638, Emperor Taizong, celebrating the birth of a grandson, held a feast for imperial officials, at which he made the comment: > Before I took the throne, it was by Fang Xuangling's assistance that I was > able to seize power. After I took the throne, it was by Wei Zheng's > assistance that I was able to have my errors corrected. He then awarded both Fang and Wei an imperial sword. Also around that time, Wei advised him to be cognizant that he was not accepting adverse advice from others as he had previously. Emperor Taizong agreed to examine himself more carefully. In 639, after Ashina Duobi's nephew Ashina Jiesheshuai formed a plot to ambush Emperor Taizong, but his plot was discovered and destroyed, Emperor Taizong created a Tujue prince who had served him faithfully, Li Simo (n√© Ashina Simo) the Prince of Huaihua, as the khan of a newly recreated Eastern Tujue state (as Qilibi Khan), and had him take the Eastern Tujue people outside of Tang territory, to be settled between Tang and Xueyantuo. At that time, Emperor Taizong made the comment that he nearly suffered because he did not listen to Wei's suggestion in 630. In 640, after a number of years during which Qu Wentai, initially submissive to Tang, became hostile to Tang interests and had allied himself with Western Tujue, Emperor Taizong sent Hou Junji to conquer Gaochang. Qu Wentai died from illness during the siege, and his son Qu Zhisheng () surrendered. Wei advised that Emperor Taizong should keep Qu on the throne, as an ally‚Äîa suggestion that Chu Suiliang also spoke of‚Äîbut Emperor Taizong disagreed and annexed Gaochang directly. (Emperor Taizong would later regret this in 642, when the need to station soldiers at Gaochang became more and more expensive in monetary and human costs.) When Hou's lieutenant Xue Wanjun () was subsequently accused of raping Gaochang women, Emperor Taizong was going to hold cross-examination sessions between Xue and the alleged victims, but on Wei's urging‚Äîthat whatever the results were, the empire would be harmed‚ÄîEmperor Taizong cancelled the investigation. In 641, Fang and Gao Shilian drew rebuke from Emperor Taizong when they inquired of the deputy imperial architect, Dou Desu () of imperial construction projects ‚Äî which Emperor Taizong saw as an encroachment on his liberty. However, Wei pointed out that chancellors were supposed to be responsible for all affairs of state, and Emperor Taizong, realizing that he had erred, was humbled. In 642, Wei was ill, and Emperor Taizong and he exchanged letters with each other expressing how they missed each other, and in Wei's letters, he continued to give adverse advice to Emperor Taizong. Meanwhile, as Wei's mansion had no large halls, Emperor Taizong diverted the construction material that he was going to use for an imperial hall and constructed a hall for Wei in five days, and further awarded him with folding screens, bedding, a small table, and canes, hoping to comfort him. When Wei wrote to thank him, Emperor Taizong wrote back, stating, \\"I honor you for the people and the state, not for you. Why thank me?\\" Meanwhile, Chu, himself by now developing a reputation for offering adverse advice, was pointing out that Emperor Taizong's favors for Li Tai were creating uncertainties for officials, and Emperor Taizong, trying to stem the rumors that Li Tai would displace Li Chengqian, appointed Wei as a senior advisor to Li Chengqian. When Wei grew better, he personally went to the palace to decline, but Emperor Taizong pointed out the symbolic importance of having someone as important as himself serve as Li Chengqian's advisor, stating that even if Wei could only lie on the bed, his being named a senior advisor to Li Chengqian would help clarify the situation. Wei relented and accepted. In spring 643, Wei was gravely ill. Emperor Taizong sent numerous messengers to attend to Wei's illness, and further had the official Li Anyan () stay at Wei's mansion to oversee Wei's care. He also personally visited Wei, with Li Chengqian, and he pointed at his daughter Princess Hengshan and promised to give her to Wei's son Wei Shuyu in marriage. Wei died soon thereafter, and Emperor Taizong buried Wei with great honors and luxurious funeral supplies, although Wei's wife Lady Pei, pointing out that Wei was himself frugal in living, declined most of the luxuries. Wei was buried near the tomb of Empress Zhangsun (who died in 636), where Emperor Taizong would eventually himself be buried. He also commissioned a stone monument for Wei, and personally wrote the text of the monument. He missed Wei greatly and stated: > Using copper as a mirror allows one to keep his clothes neat. Using history > as a mirror allows one to see the future trends. Using a person as a mirror > allows one to see what is right and what is wrong. When Wei Zheng died, I > lost a mirror. Later that year, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Wei's was one of the portraits commissioned. Later in 643, however, Li Chengqian was found to have plotted with Hou to overthrow Emperor Taizong, as he was apprehensive that Emperor Taizong would displace him with Li Tai. Emperor Taizong executed Hou and the other coconspirators, while deposing and exiling Li Chengqian (although he also blamed Li Tai's machinations for Li Chengqian's downfall and exiled him as well, creating their younger brother Li Zhi crown prince instead). As Wei had previously repeatedly recommended Hou and Du Zhenglun, a key advisor to Li Chengqian who was also exiled, as chancellor material, Emperor Taizong suspected Wei of factionalism. Also, it was discovered at the time that Wei had recorded his adverse advice to Emperor Taizong and given them to Chu, who was the imperial historian as well, displeasing Emperor Taizong further. He therefore cancelled the planned marriage between Princess Hengshan and Wei Shuyu and destroyed the stone monument that he had commissioned for Wei. In 645, after Emperor Taizong carried out a failed attempt to conquer Goguryeo, he regretted the campaign and stated, \\"If Wei Zheng were still alive, he would not have allowed me to go on this campaign.\\" He sent imperial messengers to make sacrifices to Wei and restore the stone monument, and he also summoned Wei's wife and children, greatly awarding them. Veneration Wei Zheng is venerated as a door god in some Chinese and Taoist temples, usually in partnership with Li Shiji.

He was also among the generals sent against Satibarzanes, whom he slew in battle with his own hand. In 329 BC, together with Craterus and Hephaestion, and with the assistance of Aristander, a soothsayer, he endeavoured to dissuade Alexander from crossing the Jaxartes river against the Scythians. In 328 BC he fell in a battle against the Bactrian fugitives.

It is sometimes known as the European wasp, but the same name is used for the species Vespula germanica, which is also known as the German wasp. Another name for Vespula vulgaris is the common yellow-jacket. In 2010, wasps in North America thought to be Vespula vulgaris were found to be a different species, Vespula alascensis. Basic features Vespula vulgaris is a eusocial vespid that builds its tan paper nest in or on a structure capable of supporting it. A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6‚Äì11 months and each colony cycle produces around 3000‚Äì8000 larvae. The extraordinary adaptation skills of V. vulgaris enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as V. germanica, has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans. Taxonomy The name Vespula vulgaris comes from the origin of the word vulgaris, which means \\"common\\" in Latin, therefore giving the name, the common wasp. This species has many synonyms such as the \\"common wasp\\", \\"European wasp\\", Paravespula vulgaris, or the \\"common yellow jacket\\". However, a study from 2010 revealed that V. vulgaris and the American common yellow jacket are actually two different species, the latter now known as V. alascensis. It is closely related to another wasp species, V. austriaca, and is considered a sister taxon. Common wasps are colloquially called \\"jaspers\\" in some English regions (Dorset, Lincolnshire, and elsewhere in the English Midlands); whether this comes from the Latin vespa or from the abdomen resembling the striped mineral jasper, is not clear. Description and identification Adult workers of V. vulgaris measure about from head to abdomen, and weigh 84.1 ¬± 19.0 mg, whereas the queen is about long. It has aposematic colors of black and yellow; yellow pronotal bands which are almost parallel to each other and black dots and rings on its abdomen. The queens and females appear very similar to Vespula germanica, except when they are seen head on, as the V. vulgaris face lacks the three black dots of V. germanica. Instead, each has only one black mark on its clypeus, which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its clypeus can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to V. germanica. Still more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of V. vulgaris males is to seek the distinct aedeagus tip shapes and lateral processes of their genitalia. Distribution and habitat V. vulgaris is a Palearctic species. It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia. Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as V. vulgaris in North America were Vespula alascensis, which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species. V. vulgaris has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its foraging activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 ¬∞C). Northern Hemisphere colony cycle Five distinguishable stages occur in V. vulgaris colony cycle in the temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30‚Äì35 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 larvae up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200‚Äì300 eggs per day for 24 days. *Stage 1 ‚Äì solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers. *Stage 2 ‚Äì rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population. *Stage 3 ‚Äì slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2. *Stage 4 ‚Äì climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, as do unmated queens, and foraging rate per worker increases. Drones and queens mate, and the queens hibernate to emerge in the spring, when the cycle repeats with stage 1. *Stage 5 ‚Äì decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic. Brood production The general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to cannibalism, scavenging or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days). The first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage. Nest foundation by the queen After coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \\"perfect\\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area. (Please see 'behavior' section for more detailed description of the queen's movement.) After she has fixed the position of the nest, she begins to build it. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20‚Äì30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides. When the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly. After the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as gynes and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods. To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker- laid eggs in a process known as worker policing. When the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when cannibalism occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation. Nest Nest composed of chewed wood fibers A V. vulgaris nest is made from chewed wood fibers mixed with worker saliva. It is generally made of brittle tan coloured paper. It has open cells and a cylindrical column known as a petiole attaching the nest to the substrate. The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants and secrete it around the base of the petiole, to avoid ant predation. Many variations are seen in the characteristics of the nests within the species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32 ¬∞C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down. V. vulgaris wasps recognize their nests by making pheromone trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging. Those \\"footprints\\" are not colony specific, but species specific. Although many other insects such as ants produce such pheromone trails as well, Vespula vulgaris generate pheromone either by special abdominal glands or from the gut. Although the two species Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica have extremely similar biological features, characteristics of their nests are distinctive. Vespula germanica nests generally survive the winter, while those of Vespula vulgaris do not. This difference is due mainly to the variation in prey. Vespula vulgaris food sources are greatly affected by temperature, while those of Vespula germanica are not, providing them with a higher chance of survival even during the winter. Because many Vespula germanica are able to overwinter and most Vespula vulgaris are not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of the two species. Vespula germanica generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500‚Äì9000 larvae in one colony cycle) than Vespula vulgaris (3000‚Äì8000 larvae in one colony cycle). Behaviors =Dance-like wing movement of queen= When the queen has found the appropriate nesting site, she orients in a similar way as the workers and flies back out of the hole. She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \\"8\\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen Vespula vulgaris marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site. =Defensive behaviors= Only wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture ‚Äì they rise onto the tips of their tarsi, put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks. However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the Vespula vulgaris workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, Vespula vulgaris can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior. Research indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes. Vespula vulgaris wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect Ultracoelostoma brittini in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests. =Over-wintering behaviors= After mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the German wasp. Venom The painful, though rarely life-threatening sting involves the injection of a complex venom containing amines (histamine, tyramine, serotonin, and catecholamines), peptides, and proteins, including many hydrolases, but quite different in nature from those in bee venom. Factors affecting foraging The foraging activity of Vespula vulgaris is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2¬∞ C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2¬∞ C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be ‚Äì i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage. The foraging activities of Vespula vulgaris are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because dews and nectars are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae. Generally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid. The average life span of an adult Vespula vulgaris is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker Vespula vulgaris and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest. Diet Similarly to other Vespulas, Vespula vulgaris feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and carbohydrates, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements. Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as Hymenoptera, lepidopteran larvae and Diptera and spiders. Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey. Although the types of prey Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica forage are almost the same, that of Vespula germanica are generally 2‚Äì3.5 times bigger and heavier than that of Vespula vulgaris. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the Vespula germanica foragers are bigger in morphology than those of Vespula vulgaris, and they both transport the prey by carrying them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey. Caste system In the early stage of the colony founding, the queen Vespula vulgaris does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests. Queen One possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female ‚Äì the queen. As mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female Vespula vulgaris is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the hierarchy of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \\"higher\\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring. In order for the Vespula vulgaris queen to dominate all the workers ‚Äì usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony ‚Äìshe possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne pheromone from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance. Pest status Along with the German wasp and three species of Polistes (all invasive species), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it directly predates native insects and competes with endemic species for food, such as insects and honeydew. In some South Island beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world. It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds. Predators Vespula vulgaris is subject to predation by the honey buzzard, which excavates the nests to obtain the larvae. The hoverfly Volucella pellucens and some of its relatives lay their eggs in a wasp nest, and their larvae feed on the wasps' young and dead adults. Larvae of the ripiphorid beetle Metoecus paradoxus are a parasitoid of V. vulgaris larvae. Robber fly and spiders are other predators of this and many other species. A species of parasitic mite, Varroa destructor jacobsoni, was found on larvae of this species in Poland in 1988.

Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 30. ), with the purpose of elevating the work of \\"artists\\", which included painters, sculptors and architects, above that of mere craftsmen. Other founders included Girolamo Muziano and Pietro Olivieri. The Academy was named after Saint Luke the evangelist who, legend has it, made a portrait of the Virgin Mary, and thus became the patron saint of painters' guilds. From the late 16th century until it moved to its present location at the Palazzo Carpegna, it was based in an urban block by the Roman Forum and although these buildings no longer survive, the Academy church of Santi Luca e Martina, does. Designed by the Baroque architect, Pietro da Cortona, its main facade overlooks the Forum.  History  The Academy's predecessor was the Compagnia di San Luca, a guild of painters and miniaturists, which had its statutes and privileges renewed at the much earlier date of 17 December 1478 by Pope Sixtus IV. Included among its founding members, was the famous painter Melozzo da Forl√¨, as he was the pictor papalis in that period. In 1605, Pope Paul V granted the Academy the right to pardon a condemned man on the feast of St. Luke. In the 1620s, Urban VIII extended its rights to decide who was considered an artist in Rome and it came under the patronage of his nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini. In 1633, Urban VIII gave it the right to tax all artists as well as art-dealers, and monopolize all public commissions. These latter measures raised strong opposition and apparently were poorly enforced. Over the early years, the papal authorities exerted a large degree of control over the leadership of the institution. Some modern critics have stated \\"with the ostensible purpose of giving artists a higher education and the real one of asserting the Church's control over art,\\".according to Peter Robb, biographer of the Baroque artist Caravaggio The pr√¨ncipi (directors) of the institution have included some of the pre-eminent painters of the 17th century, including Domenichino, Bernini, Cortona and Romanelli. However, many prominent artists never joined or were admitted to the academy.  The Cortona-Sacchi Debate and other artistic issues  Artistic issues debated within the Academy included the Cortona-Sacchi controversy (see Andrea Sacchi for further details of this debate) about the number of figures in a painting. Disdain was expressed by many academicians for the Bamboccianti. Giovanni Bellori gave famous lectures on painting in the Academy. In the early 18th century, the painter Marco Benefial was inducted, and then expelled for criticizing the academy as an insider.  Recent times  The Academy is still active; the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca is its modern descendant. From the very beginning, the statutes of the Academy directed that each candidate- academician was to donate a work of his art in perpetual memory and, later, a portrait. Thus the Academy, in its current premises in the 16th-century Palazzo Carpegna, located in the Piazza dell'Accademia di San Luca, has accumulated a unique collection of paintings and sculptures, including about 500 portraits, as well as an outstanding collection of drawings.  Principi  Prominent artists to become Principe of the academy over the first 200 years include: Claude Lorrain was a member but declined the offer of being principi. The Academy can also boast modern members, including sculptors Ernesto Biondi and Piccirilli Brothers.

He was Empress Zhangsun's brother, which made him a brother-in-law of Emperor Taizong (Li Shimin) and a maternal uncle of Emperor Gaozong (Li Zhi). He was an important advisor to Li Shimin when the latter was still the Prince of Qin during the reign of his father, Emperor Gaozu. He helped Li Shimin overcome his brothers Li Jiancheng (the Crown Prince) and Li Yuanji (the Prince of Qi) in a succession struggle at the Xuanwu Gate Incident, eventually enabling Li Shimin to become the heir apparent and later the emperor. He was also instrumental in Emperor Taizong's selection of Li Zhi as the Crown Prince, and was exceedingly powerful after Li Zhi took the throne as Emperor Gaozong. However, he gradually fell out of his nephew's favour by failing to support Emperor Gaozong's decision to depose his first wife, Empress Wang, and replacing her with Empress Wu, especially after the beginning of the new year 657 with the power of Empress Wu fell more. In 659, Zhangsun Wuji was falsely accused of treason by Empress Wu's political ally, Xu Jingzong, and eventually ordered to be sent into exile by Emperor Gaozong. Xu Jingzong subsequently sent the official Yuan Gongyu (Ë¢ÅÂÖ¨Áëú) to force Zhangsun Wuji to commit suicide on his way to exile. Early life It is not known when Zhangsun Wuji was born, but what is known is that he was older than his sister, the future Empress Zhangsun, who was born in 601. It was written that his ancestors traced their origin to the Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei's founding emperor Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei's 17th generation ancestor Tuoba Kuaili (ÊãìÊãîÂÑàÁ´ã) ‚Äî that their ancestor was Tuoba Kuali's third son, who took the surname Baba (ÊãîÊãî), eventually changed to Zhangsun when Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei changed Xianbei surnames to Han surnames in 496.Zhangsun Wuji's biography in the Old Book of Tang actually wrote that the Zhangsuns traced their ancestry to the \\"third older brother of Emperor Xianwen of Northern Wei.\\" See Old Book of Tang, vol. 65. However, this appeared to be in error, as Emperor Xianwen was the oldest son of his father, Emperor Wencheng of Northern Wei, and thus could not have had a third older brother. Based on the Book of Wei, the reference appeared to be intended to \\"the third older brother of Emperor Xian of Northern Wei,\\" Emperor Xian being the posthumous honor conferred by Emperor Taiwu on Tuoba Kuali's son and successor Tuoba Linli (ÊãìÊãîÈÑ∞Á´ã). See Book of Wei, vols. 1, 113. His father was the Sui Dynasty general Zhangsun Sheng (), and his mother was Zhangsun Sheng's wife Lady Gao, the daughter of the official Gao Jingde (È´òÊï¨Âæ∑).While historical records clearly state that Lady Gao was Zhangsun Sheng's wife, she might have not been his first wife, as while it was possible that Zhangsun Wuji's older brother Zhangsun Anye, who was said to have expelled Zhangsun Wuji and Empress Zhangsun from the Zhangsun household, could have done so merely on pure strength, he might not have otherwise had the authority to do so had his mother not also have been a wife (i.e., a wife who died prior to Zhangsun Sheng's marriage to Lady Gao) rather than a concubine. He had at least three older brothers‚ÄîZhangsun Sheng's oldest son Zhangsun Xingbu (Èï∑Â≠´Ë°åÂ∏É, who was killed in 604 while resisting the rebellion of Emperor Yang of Sui's brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han), Zhangsun Heng'an (Èï∑Â≠´ÊÅÜÂÆâ), and Zhangsun Anye (Èï∑Â≠´ÂÆâÊ•≠). (Empress Zhangsun was also born of Lady Gao, while Zhangsun Anye was not; who Zhangsun Xingbu's and Zhangsun Heng'an's mothers were was not recorded in history.) Zhangsun Sheng died in 609, and Zhangsun Anye, instead of raising his younger brother and sister, expelled them, as well as his stepmother Lady Gao, from the Zhangsun household and sent them back to Lady Gao's brother Gao Shilian, and Gao Shilian raised them. It was said that Zhangsun Wuji was studious, and that he was both intelligent and full of strategies. When his sister later married Li Shimin, the second son of the general Li Yuan, he and Li Shimin became great friends. When Li Yuan, at Li Shimin's instigation, rose against the rule of Emperor Yang of Sui in 617 and attacked the capital Chang'an, Zhangsun Wuji went to meet Li Shimin, then serving as a major general of his father's, and he began to serve on Li Shimin's staff, often following Li Shimin on various campaigns.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Li Yuan captured Chang'an in winter 617 and declared Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong), taking power himself as regent. After he received news in spring 618 that Emperor Yang had been killed at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji, he had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. Li Shimin was created the Prince of Qin and thereafter became the main general in charge of his father's campaigns to reunify China under Tang rule, which was largely complete by 623, when the last major rival to Tang, Liu Heita the Prince of Handong, was captured and killed by Li Shimin's older brother, Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince. For Zhangsun Wuji's contributions to Li Shimin's campaigns, he was created the Duke of Shangdang. =Incident at Xuanwu Gate= By 623, however, Li Shimin was locked into an intense rivalry with Li Jiancheng, who was supported by another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi. For the next several years, the rivalry further intensified. By 626, Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, apprehensive that Li Shimin might act against them, had falsely accused Li Shimin's staff strategists Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui and military officer Yuchi Gong and had them removed from Li Shimin's staff. It was said that by that time, of Li Shimin's closest confidants, only Zhangsun remained, and that Zhangsun, his uncle Gao Shilian, Hou Junji, and Yuchi advocated acting first against Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji. They persuaded Li Shimin to take action. Li Shimin thereafter set up an ambush for Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, killing them at Xuanwu Gate, and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince. Zhangsun was thereafter made the minister of civil service affairs. Two months later, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin, who took the throne as Emperor Taizong.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Late in 626, when Emperor Taizong personally ranked the contributions of the generals and officials in order to grant them fiefs, Emperor Taizong ranked five of them‚ÄîZhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Yuchi Gong, and Hou Junji to be contributors of the highest grade, and Zhangsun was created the Duke of Qi. As Zhangsun was both a great contributor to his victory and a close relative, Emperor Taizong was particularly close to him, allowing Zhangsun to enter the palace frequently. In spring 627, when the general Li Yi, an associate of Li Jiancheng's, rebelled at Bin Prefecture (Ë±≥Â∑û, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Emperor Taizong sent Zhangsun to engage Li Yi, although before Zhangsun could arrive, Li Yi had been defeated by his own subordinates and killed in flight. In fall 627, Emperor Taizong, despite opposition from Empress Zhangsun (who feared that the Zhangsun clan was becoming overly honored and would become a target of attack), Emperor Taizong made Zhangsun Wuji Puye (ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the heads of the important executive bureau of the government and a post considered one for a chancellor. Later that year, when Emperor Taizong heard that Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi, who had made a deep incursion to Chang'an when Emperor Taizong first took the throne in 626, was having internal problems with his subordinates, he consulted Zhangsun and Xiao Yu, asking for their opinions. Xiao advocated an attack on Eastern Tujue, but Zhangsun pointed out that the peace treaty between the two states should not be breached, and Emperor Taizong accepted his suggestion. Many officials were critical of Zhangsun Wuji's ascension to a chancellor post, and there were secret accusations made to Emperor Taizong that Zhangsun was monopolizing power. Emperor Taizong publicly declared confidence in Zhangsun, but he himself feared that he was a target of resentment. He repeatedly offered to resign, both directly and through Empress Zhangsun, and in spring 628, Emperor Taizong accepted the resignation, although he conferred on Zhangsun the honorific position of Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏) and continued to consult Zhangsun on many important matters. In 633, Emperor Taizong conferred on Zhangsun the even greater honor of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫): one of the Three Excellencies. In 637, a major revision of the Sui penal laws, led by Fang but assisted by Zhangsun, was completed, with 500 sections dividing the punishments into 20 grades. About 1,600 sections of regulations to implement the laws were also written. Also in 637, as part of Emperor Taizong's scheme to bestow prefectures on his relatives and great generals and officials as their permanent domains, Zhangsun's title was changed to Duke of Zhao, and he was given the post of prefect of Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, roughly modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), to be inherited by his heirs. Many officials opposed the plan, with the strongest opposition coming from Zhangsun, who also had his daughter-in- law, Princess Changle (Emperor Taizong's daughter) submit oppositions on his behalf as well, and Emperor Taizong cancelled the scheme, although Zhangsun's title remained Duke of Zhao. In 642, Emperor Taizong changed Zhangsun's honorific from Sikong to Situ (Âè∏Âæí). In 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Zhangsun's was one of the portraits commissioned‚Äîindeed, Zhangsun's portraits was ranked first. =Succession dispute= Later in 643, Li Chengqian the Crown Prince (the oldest son of Emperor Taizong and Empress Zhangsun, who had died in 636), locked into an intense rivalry with his younger brother Li Tai the Prince of Wei, who was also born of Empress Zhangsun and was Emperor Taizong's favorite son, was discovered to have plotted to overthrow Emperor Taizong, along with Hou Junji and Emperor Taizong's sons-in-law Zhao Jie (Ë∂ôÁØÄ) and Du He (ÊùúËç∑, Du Ruhui's son). Emperor Taizong put the investigation in the hands of Zhangsun, Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, Li Shiji, and the officials in charge of the supreme court and the legislative and examination bureaus of government, and they determined that, indeed, Li Chengqian had plotted to overthrow Emperor Taizong. Li Chengqian was deposed, while his coconspirators were executed. A succession question immediately arose. Li Tai was Emperor Taizong's favorite son, and Emperor Taizong almost immediately promised to him that he would be created crown prince, an idea concurred by the chancellors Cen Wenben and Liu Ji. However, Zhangsun did not concur, and instead recommended that Emperor Taizong make his ninth son Li Zhi, also by Empress Zhangsun, crown prince instead; Zhangsun was supported in this suggestion by Chu Suiliang. Further, when Emperor Taizong interrogated Li Chengqian personally, Li Chengqian admitted guilt but blamed Li Tai's machinations for leading him to fear for his own safety and thus plot rebellion. Emperor Taizong thereafter resolved to create Li Zhi crown prince‚Äîa decision that he initially secretly informed only Zhangsun, Fang, Li Shiji, and Chu, in addition to Li Zhi himself‚Äîand he exiled both Li Chengqian and Li Tai. Subsequently, Zhangsun, along with Fang and Xiao, were made senior advisors to the new crown prince. Thereafter, however, Emperor Taizong began to doubt whether his decision was correct‚Äîbelieving that while Li Zhi was kind, he was also weak in personality, and unsure whether he would be fit to be emperor. He discussed with Zhangsun the possibility of making another son, Li Ke the Prince of Wu (by his concubine Consort Yang, a daughter of Sui's Emperor Yang), who was older than Li Zhi and considered more capable, crown prince instead. Zhangsun strenuously opposed this idea, and Emperor Taizong did not carry it out. Zhangsun further often praised Li Zhi's kindness. Thereafter, a deep enmity developed between Zhangsun and Li Ke. In 644, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, stated to his key officials their strengths and weaknesses, he spoke, with regard to Zhangsun: :Zhangsun Wuji is overly worried about appearance of conflict of interest. He is dexterious and decisive beyond the wisdom of the ancients, but commanding an army in the battlefield is not his strength. =Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War= Later in 644, when Emperor Taizong launched a major attack against Goguryeo, he had the generals Li Shiji and Li Daozong lead the forward forces, while commanding the main forces himself, assisted by Zhangsun, Cen, and Yang Shidao. In summer 645, at a major battle against the main Goguryeo forces commanded by the generals Go Yeonsu () and Go Hyezin () engaged Tang forces, Emperor Taizong had Li Shiji command 15,000 men to serve as decoy, and when Goguryeo forces attacked Li Shiji, Zhangsun Wuji attacked them from behind with 11,000 men, and Li Shiji and Zhangsun, as well as Emperor Taizong himself, defeated Goguryeo forces, forcing their surrender. He then considered directly attacking Goguryeo's capital Pyongyang itself, but Li Shiji believed that if Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) was not captured first, the general in command of Ansi (a capable general known in Korean popular legends as Yang Manchun, although whether that was his real name is unknown), might attack Tang forces from the rear. Emperor Taizong agreed, and therefore put Ansi under siege again. However, the commander at Ansi was a capable defender, and the resolve of the defenders was strengthened when Li Shiji, in anger, declared that after the fall of the city all residents would be slaughtered. With the Tang forces bogged down in sieging Ansi, a number of officials suggested skipping past Ansi and attacking Ogol (, in modern Dandong, Liaoning) and then head toward Pyongyang. Zhangsun opposed, believing the strategy to be too risky without first capturing Ansi and Geonan (, in modern Yingkou, Liaoning) first. Emperor Taizong agreed and continued sieging Ansi, but still could not capture it. In fall 645, with winter approaching, Emperor Taizong was forced to withdraw. (The Song Dynasty historian Hu Sanxing, the commentator to the Zizhi Tongjian, commented that overcautiousness was what cost Emperor Taizong the victory, indirectly blaming Zhangsun for opposing the strategy to attack Pyongyang directly.) As the army retreated, Zhangsun was responsible for building a temporary bridge over the Liao River to allow the army to cross. In 647, when Zhangsun's uncle Gao Shilian died, Emperor Taizong, who had just recently himself recovered from an illness, wanted to attend Gao's wake, but Zhangsun lay down in the path of his horse, blocking him, reasoning that as someone who had recently recovered, it was inappropriate for Emperor Taizong to attend the wake. Emperor Taizong, due to Zhangsun's opposition, relented. In summer 647, Emperor Taizong made Zhangsun the commandant at Yang Prefecture (i.e., Jiangdu), but did not actually send him to Yang Prefecture. In fall 647, when a commoner named Duan Zhichong () submitted a petition to Emperor Taizong, asking him to yield the throne to Li Zhi, Li Zhi became concerned that Emperor Taizong would suspect that the proposal came from him, and Zhangsun requested that Duan be executed. Emperor Taizong, however, was unfazed, and took no actions against Duan. In spring 648, Emperor Taizong made Zhangsun the acting head of the legislative bureau‚Äîalso a chancellor post‚Äîand further gave instructions that he also be in charge of the other two main bureaus of government, the executive and the examination bureaus, effectively putting Zhangsun in command of all of the government. In summer 649, Emperor Taizong was seriously ill, while at the summer palace Cuiwei Palace (). He summoned Zhangsun and Chu to his bedside and entrusted Li Zhi to them. He soon died, and by Zhangsun's orders, his death was kept a secret until his casket, accompanied by Li Zhi, was returned to Chang'an. Li Zhi then took the throne (as Emperor Gaozong).  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  After Emperor Gaozong took the throne, he changed Zhangsun's honorific title to Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â), also one of the Three Excellencies, and ordered that he continued to be in charge of all three bureaus, although Zhangsun declined the responsibility over the executive bureau. Emperor Gaozong also gave him the chancellor de facto designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ). Early in Emperor Gaozong's reign, it was said that, while there were other men with chancellor designations, Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang controlled the government, but that they served faithfully and were extending the efficient governance that Emperor Taizong instituted during his \\"Reign of Zhen'guan.\\" However, perhaps challenging Zhangsun's authority and/or faithfulness, the Tufan king Songts√§n Gampo wrote a letter to Zhangsun, stating, \\"The Son of Heaven has just taken the throne. If there are unfaithful subjects among the officials, I will lead an army to the capital to destroy them.\\" However, Emperor Gaozong trusted both Zhangsun and Chu greatly, and in 650, when a commoner named Li Hongtai (ÊùéÂºòÊ≥∞) accused Zhangsun of treason, Emperor Gaozong had Li Hongtai immediately beheaded. In 651, another revision of the laws, with Zhangsun in charge, was completed, and was promulgated by Emperor Gaozong. In 652, with Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wang being sonless, her uncle Liu Shi, also a chancellor, suggested to her that she propose that Emperor Gaozong's oldest son, Li Zhong, whose mother Consort Liu was of low birth, be made crown prince, believing that Li Zhong would be grateful to her. Liu Shi also lobbied Zhangsun to make the request for her. Emperor Gaozong agreed, and in fall 652 created Li Zhong crown prince. Late in 652, there was a major dispute between Fang Xuanling's oldest son and heir Fang Yizhi (ÊàøÈÅ∫Áõ¥) and his younger brother Fang Yi'ai (ÊàøÈÅ∫ÊÑõ), as well as Fang Yi'ai's wife, Emperor Taizong's daughter Princess Gaoyang. Princess Gaoyang accused Fang Yizhi of assaulting her, while Fang Yizhi accused Fang Yi'ai and Princess Gaoyang of treason. Emperor Gaozong ordered Zhangsun to investigate, and Zhangsun discovered that Fang Yi'ai, Princess Gaoyang, the general Xue Wanche (ËñõËê¨Âæπ), and another brother-in-law of Emperor Gaozong's, Chai Lingwu (Êü¥‰ª§Ê≠¶), had considered to support Emperor Taizong's younger brother Li Yuanjing (ÊùéÂÖÉÊôØ) the Prince of Jing as emperor. Fang Yi'ai, knowing that Zhangsun had long wanted to kill Li Ke, whom he viewed as a threat to Emperor Gaozong's throne, falsely implicated Li Ke in the plot as well, hoping that Zhangsun would spare him. Zhangsun, however, used this opportunity to carry out a purge‚Äîand in spring 653, Zhangsun persuaded Emperor Gaozong to issue an edict executing Fang Yi'ai, Xue, and Chai, while ordering Li Yuanjing, Li Ke, and Princesses Gaoyang and Baling (Chai's wife) to commit suicide. Further, Zhangsun also had the chancellor Yuwen Jie (a friend of Fang Yi'ai's), Li Daozong (who had long had a rivalry with Zhangsun and Chu), and the general Zhishi Sili (Âü∑Â§±ÊÄùÂäõ), Xue's brother Xue Wanbei (ËñõËê¨ÂÇô) as well as Li Ke's mother Consort Yang and Consort Yang's younger son Li Yin, reduced to commoner rank and exiled. (For these actions, he was heavily criticized by Liu Xu, the lead editor of the Old Book of Tang, who commented that perhaps it was karmic that eventually Zhangsun himself would be falsely accused.Old Book of Tang, vol. 65. Indeed, when Li Ke died, he cursed Zhangsun, stating: \\"Zhangsun Wuji has stolen imperial power and falsely accused the faithful. The imperial ancestral spirits are watching. Soon your own clan will be slaughtered.\\") =Downfall= By 654, Emperor Gaozong had become enamored with Consort Wu‚Äîwhom he had, against Confucian definitions of incest, taken as a concubine even though she had been a concubine of Emperor Taizong's. (Empress Wang, who had been jealous of Emperor Gaozong's then- favorite concubine Consort Xiao, had suggested that he take Consort Wu as a concubine, in order to divide Consort Xiao's favors, but as Emperor Gaozong's favors became exclusively concentrated on Consort Wu, she turned to ally with Consort Xiao against Consort Wu, to no avail.) In 654, after Consort Wu's infant daughter died, Emperor Gaozong began considering deposing Empress Wang and replacing her with Consort Wu. (Historians have suggested that Consort Wu murdered her own daughter in order to frame the Empress, however there is no evidence that the infant was actually murdered, and could have died from natural causes). However, Gaozong feared opposition from the high level officials. He visited Zhangsun's mansion along with Consort Wu, bestowing lavish gifts on Zhangsun and making Zhangsun's three sons mid-level officials, and used the opportunity to bring up the topic of replacing Empress Wang with Consort Wu. Zhangsun pretended not to understand and took no actions to endorse Consort Wu, and persisted in this stand despite later lobbying by both Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and fellow chancellor Xu Jingzong. However, soon, Xu, Li Yifu (who became chancellor over his overt support for Consort Wu), as well as other key officials Cui Yixuan (Â¥îÁæ©ÁéÑ) and Yuan Gongyu, formed an alliance in support of Consort Wu. In fall 655, after an imperial gathering, Emperor Gaozong summoned Zhangsun, Li Ji (i.e., Li Shiji‚Äîhe had dropped the character \\"Shi\\" by this point by Emperor Gaozong's orders that naming taboo was to be observed as to the characters Shi and Min, not just the sequence \\"Shimin\\" as Emperor Taizong had ordered), Chu, and Yu Zhining to the palace‚Äîan order that Chu correctly guessed that was intended to call them into a meeting in which he would try to persuade them to agree with his desire to replace Empress Wang with Consort Wu. Li Ji declined to enter. When Zhangsun, Chu, and Yu attended the meeting, Emperor Gaozong did indeed propose to replace Empress Wang with Consort Wu. Chu objected strenuously, while Zhangsun and Yu did not speak but showed no approval. Later, fellow chancellors Han Yuan and Lai Ji also showed opposition, but when Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji, Li Ji responded, \\"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\\" Emperor Gaozong, after demoting Chu to a commandant post at Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), deposed Empress Wang and Consort Xiao to commoner rank and created Consort Wu as empress to replace Empress Wang. (Soon, by Empress Wu's orders, the former Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were tortured and killed.) =Death= By the beginning of 657, the power of Empress Wu and her allies was so great that they began to retaliate hard against the authorities who opposed them. By 659, Empress Wu's position was secure, and she resented how Zhangsun and Yu had shown implicit disapproval of her ascension‚Äîand Xu, who had been repeatedly rebuked by Zhangsun over this matter, also resented Zhangsun. Xu thereafter, when investigating a report of factionalism by the low level officials Wei Jifang (ÈüãÂ≠£Êñπ) and Li Chao (ÊùéÂ∑¢), manufactured evidence that Zhangsun had plotted treason with them. Emperor Gaozong wanted to interrogate Zhangsun personally, but at Xu's suggestion‚Äîpointing out that Zhangsun had been experienced at quick reactions as demonstrated by his achievements‚Äîin summer 659, suddenly stripped Zhangsun's posts and fief, and while he officially gave Zhangsun the title of commandant at Yang Prefecture, he instead exiled Zhangsun to Qian Prefecture (ÈªîÂ∑û, modern southeastern Chongqing) under house arrest. Zhangsun's sons were also exiled. In fall 659, Emperor Gaozong further reopened the investigations, putting Li Ji, Xu, Xin Maojiang, Ren Yaxiang, and Lu Chengqing in charge of investigating the alleged plot. Xu took this opportunity to send Yuan Gongyu to Qian Prefecture, where Yuan by order of Empress Wu forced Zhangsun to commit suicide. His wealth was confiscated. (As part of the same reprisal transactions, Empress Wang's uncle Liu Shi was also executed in exile. Members of the Zhangsun and Liu households, as well as those of Han's, were forced to hard labor, while several relatives of Zhangsun's were also executed.) Later in Emperor Gaozong's reign, in 674, Emperor Gaozong restored Zhangsun's titles posthumously and allowed Zhangsun's great-grandson Zhangsun Yi (Èï∑Â≠´Áøº) to inherit the title of Duke of Zhao. He also had Zhangsun's casket returned to Chang'an, to be buried near Emperor Taizong's tomb.

The first Europeans recorded as visiting the area were the exploratory party of Hamilton Hume in 1821. The name of the town is believed to derive either from an Aboriginal word meaning \\"under the hills, surrounded by hills, or towards a high place\\" or from Bennelong, the name of a noted Aborigine. = European settlement = Binalong lay beyond the border of the Nineteen Counties which was the formal legal extent of European settlement in New South Wales. However, squatters settled in the district prior to the formal establishment of squatting districts in 1839. From 1847 there was a court of petty sessions. The same year a local entrepreneur applied successfully to the Commissioner of Police for a grant to build an inn to provide accommodation and victuals for the visiting magistrate and police witnesses, and the Swan Inn was established close to the courthouse. The town was gazetted in 1850. In 1853, Cobb and Co was established in Melbourne as a coaching company, and upon eventually expanding their operations into New South Wales, entered into an agreement with the Swan Inn to provide staging services for coaches, drivers and passengers travelling along the adjacent road to the goldfields at Lambing Flat or Young. The town flourished as a coaching stop. The Swan Inn became known as \\"The Cobb and Co\\". = Consolidation = The public school was established in 1861. The original railway station opened in 1875 and was replaced by the current structure on an island platform when the railway was deviated and duplicated in 1916. The 1916 signal box is now closed. The original station remains as a private house on the road to Yass. The Swan Inn closed following the building of the railway and the establishment of other hostelries closer to the railway station. It reopened in the mid-1980s as a restaurant and continues under the name The Black Swan. A motel was built on the adjoining block of land.

It is still a busy railway centre with Canadian and international freight traffic. Cranbrook was incorporated as a city in 1905 when Cranbrook boomed into the major economic, and commercial centre of the Kootenays.

It emphasizes deluxe railway passenger cars design in various eras (1886, 1907, 1929, 1936) as well as deluxe railway hotel architecture. The museum is an outgrowth of the Cranbrook Archives, Museum and Landmark Foundation, founded in 1976 with the initial goal of converting an out of service rail car into a local art gallery. The group then discovered that they had unknowingly purchased a dining car from the short-lived Trans-Canada Limited luxury rail line (1929-1931), and the focus of the project shifted to more extensive rail rehabilitation efforts.

Instead of the usual mechanical and technological focus that most railway museums employ, the museum emphasizes the social aspects of the railway through travel and design. It located downtown next to the busy rail yards of the CPR, on Highway 3/95, a major east-west Canadian arterial highway, and a major north-south route linking Banff and Japser National Parks with the Pacific North-West of the USA. Cranbrook is about 50 miles (80 km) north of the Idaho and Montana border with Canada and British Columbia.

He was praised for his quick thinking but criticized by historians for his being overly attentive to the emperors' desires.  Background  Feng Deyi was born in 568, when his grandfather Feng Longzhi (Â∞ÅÈöÜ‰πã) was a high level official for Northern Qi. His father Feng Zixiu (Â∞ÅÂ≠êÁπ°) served as a provincial governor for Northern Zhou, but was captured by the Chen Dynasty general Wu Mingche in a battle, probably in 573, during Wu's main offensive against Northern Qi. Sometime after Northern Qi was destroyed by Northern Zhou in 577, Feng Zixiu fled back north, and was made a provincial governor by Emperor Wen of Sui, whose Sui Dynasty succeeded Northern Zhou in 581. Feng Deyi's mother Lady Lu was the sister of the official Lu Sidao. In Feng Deyi's youth, Lu Sidao often said, with regard to Feng Deyi, \\"This child is more intelligent than other people, and one day will surely be a highly-ranked official, even chancellor.\\"  During Emperor Wen's reign  In 589, Emperor Wen's forces destroyed Chen, reuniting China. In 590, with people in the Chen territory unaccustomed and aggrieved by Sui law, there were agrarian rebellions in much of former Chen territory, and Emperor Wen sent the major general Yang Su to quell the rebellions. Yang Su made Feng Deyi a secretary of his, and was impressed by Feng's calmness, particularly after an accident in which Feng was almost drowned but remained calm after the incident. Later, after he quelled the revolts, he was made chancellor, and he retained Feng on staff. In 593, Emperor Wen put Yang Su in charge of constructing his summer palace Renshou Palace (‰ªÅÂ£ΩÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Yang Su made Feng his assistant, and they constructed a magnificent palace, at much human and material cost. After the palace was completed in 595, the frugal Emperor Wen visited the palace and was initially displeased at its magnificence and human cost, rebuking Yang Su. Yang Su was fearful that Emperor Wen would punish him, but Feng correctly predicted that when Emperor Wen's wife Empress Dugu arrived at the palace, Yang Su would not only not receive punishment, but would be rewarded. That indeed happened, and when Yang Su, impressed with Feng's prediction, asked him the reason, Feng responded: :The emperor is frugal by nature, and therefore he was angry when he first saw the palace. But he is attentive to the empress' words. The empress, being a woman, favored beautiful things, and I knew that once this palace pleased the empress, she would change the emperor's mind. Yang Su was impressed with Feng's analysis and praised him. Further, while Yang Su was proud of his own abilities and often found ways to insult others, he respected Feng and often requested Feng's opinions on the matters he needed to resolve as chancellor. He often touched his seat and stated, \\"One day Master Feng will have this seat,\\" and he recommended Feng to Emperor Wen, who made Feng a mid-level official, Neishi Sheren (ÂÖßÂè≤Ëàç‰∫∫), within the legislative bureau of his government (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng).  During Emperor Yang's reign  In 604, Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yang. Emperor Yang, in 605, put Feng and Yuwen Kai (ÂÆáÊñáÊÑ∑) in charge of constructing the main palace at the eastern capital Luoyang, Xianren Palace (È°Ø‰ªÅÂÆÆ), and they constructed a magnificent palace. Despite this, Feng was not promoted, and was still Neishi Sheren as of 617. In or around 617, Feng became a trusted advisor to the chancellor Yu Shiji. As Yu was unfamiliar with civil service, Feng effectively handled the civil service matters, and the edicts that he drafted were calculated to please Emperor Yang; he would also block the submissions made by officials who had different opinions than Emperor Yang. He was harsh in his application of laws, and often reduced rewards to officials with contributions. He was therefore blamed by the Old Book of Tang for Emperor Yang's increasing favors for Yu and the deteriorating state of Sui governance.Old Book of Tang, vol. 63 . In spring 618, with the Sui state embroiled in agrarian rebellions, Emperor Yang was at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), when the general Yuwen Huaji led a coup against Emperor Yang. After Yuwen's soldiers trapped Emperor Yang in the palace, Yuwen ordered Feng to publicly denounce Emperor Yang for his crimes. Emperor Yang told Feng, \\"You are well-learned. Why are you doing this?\\" Feng, in shame, withdrew from Emperor Yang's presence. Yuwen subsequently killed Emperor Yang and declared Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Yuwen Huaji subsequently abandoned Jiangdu, leading the elite Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú) back north. He made Feng the head of the legislative bureau (ÂÖßÂè≤‰ª§, Neishi Ling), a position that Feng continued to hold after Yuwen poisoned Yang Hao and declared himself the emperor of a new Xu state at Liaocheng (ËÅäÂüé, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong). Feng, seeing that Yuwen Huaji, who was repeatedly defeated by other rebel leaders, including Li Mi the Duke of Wei, Li Shentong (ÊùéÁ•ûÈÄö) the cousin of Li Yuan (who, also in 618, established Tang Dynasty at Chang'an as its Emperor Gaozu), and Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, was being weakened by the losses, befriended Yuwen Huaji's brother Yuwen Shiji, and suggested to Yuwen Shiji that he request permission from Yuwen Huaji to leave Liaocheng to collect food supplies for the army. Yuwen Huaji agreed, and Yuwen Shiji and Feng both left Liaocheng. After Liaocheng fell to Dou in 619, Yuwen Huaji was killed. Yuwen Shiji and Feng then fled to Tang territory. Emperor Gaozu, as he respected Feng as a Sui official, made him Neishi Sheren again, and soon promoted him to Neishi Shilang (ÂÖßÂè≤‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau. The chancellor Xiao Yu, impressed with Feng, recommended Feng, and Emperor Gaozu, in 620, made Feng Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) -- a new title for the head of the legislative bureau, which Emperor Gaozu had changed the name of by this point to Zhongshu Sheng (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ). As Zhongshu Ling, Feng was considered a chancellor as well. Later in 620, Emperor Gaozu sent his son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin to attack Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng, whose capital was at Luoyang. Feng accompanied Li Shimin as one of his strategists. In 621, Dou came to Wang's aid, and Emperor Gaozu, initially believing that Li Shimin could not prevail under those circumstances, secretly ordered retreat. Instead of retreating, Li Shimin sent Feng back to Chang'an to analyze to Emperor Gaozu that Wang was in desperate straits, but that if allowed to survive, could regroup and become a serious threat later. Emperor Gaozu was persuaded and allowed Li Shimin to remain. Li Shimin subsequently defeated and captured Dou, and Wang surrendered, allowing Tang to defeat two major enemies simultaneously. Pleased, Emperor Gaozu praised Feng, comparing his advice to that of the Jin Dynasty official Zhang Hua, whose advice had permitted Emperor Wu of Jin to destroy Eastern Wu. For his contributions, Feng was created the Duke of Pingyuan and continued to serve as Li Shimin's assistant. Meanwhile, an intense rivalry was developing between Li Shimin and his older brother Li Jiancheng, who, as Emperor Gaozu's oldest son, was created crown prince. During Feng's service as Li Shimin's assistant, he was often suggesting Li Shimin various ways of seizing the position of crown prince from Li Jiancheng, but at the same time was developing a relationship with Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, another son of Emperor Gaozu who supported Li Jiancheng, thus playing both sides of the rivalry without either side knowing the extent of his involvement. In 623, Feng, in addition to his other posts, also became acting minister of civil service matters. He was praised for his efficiency in the post. In 624, when Li Jiancheng was found to have improperly requisitioned soldiers to serve in his guard corps, and his guard commander Yang Wen'gan (Ê•äÊñáÂππ) then rebelled in fear, Emperor Gaozu considered deposing Li Jiancheng and replacing him with Li Shimin, but Feng made a secret submission arguing against such a move, and at least partly because of Feng's intercession, Emperor Gaozu did not depose Li Jiancheng. In 625, Feng was created the greater title of Duke of Dao, a title soon changed to Duke of Mi.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 626, Li Shimin, fearing that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him, ambushed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to first create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). He reorganized his government, and as part of the reorganization, Xiao Yu and Feng Deyi were made co-heads of the important executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), with the title of Shangshu Pushe (Â∞öÊõ∏ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ). They soon came in conflict, however, as Feng would often agree with Xiao on important matters, and then change his recommendations once they were before Emperor Taizong. Xiao, later in 626, became sufficiently angry at Feng that he wrote a submission to Emperor Taizong, denouncing Feng using unartful language. Emperor Taizong, who was already displeased with Xiao, who was also conflicting with his other chancellors Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui, soon removed Xiao from his post. In 627, Feng became ill while handling official matters at the executive bureau, and Emperor Taizong visited him personally, and then used an imperial wagon to take him back to his mansion. Feng soon died, and Emperor Taizong posthumously honored him with the high title Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫), giving him the posthumous name Ming (Êòé, meaning \\"understanding\\"). When Feng died, Emperor Taizong had not known that Feng was in fact associating with both him and Li Jiancheng, but as he reviewed imperial archives several years later, he began to realize this. In 643, with Feng's involvement in both camps becoming clear, the official Tang Lin (ÂîêËá®) submitted a posthumous indictment, requesting that Feng's honors be posthumously stripped. Emperor Taizong accepted the advice of another official, Tang Jian (ÂîêÂÑâ), who pointed out that Feng had contributions while he was alive and that the offices should not be stripped but suggested that the posthumous honors be stripped. However, he also changed Feng's posthumous name from Ming to Miao (ÁπÜ, meaning \\"inconsistent\\").

The idea of an organ scholarship is to provide the holder with playing, directing and administrative experience. It is an important part of music-making in Christian worship and is strongly associated with, but is not limited to, Anglican church music in the United Kingdom, Australia and the USA. Organ scholars may sometimes be found at a cathedral or a collegiate church. Many colleges at Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin universities, as well as other universities, offer organ scholarships to undergraduates. At some institutions (for example, Christ Church, Oxford, New College, Oxford, Trinity College, Dublin or King's College, Cambridge), the organ scholar(s) work under the direction of a full-time professional Director of Music. At other institutions, the organ scholar is in charge of running the choir. One of the first organ scholarships in the University of Cambridge was set up by Queens' College, Cambridge. An early scholar there was the composer Charles Villiers Stanford, who took up his position there in 1870. Many organ scholars have gone on to notable careers in music and in other fields. Two notable ex-organ scholars who went on to achieve fame in other fields are Edward Heath, who read Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Balliol College, Oxford and later served as British Prime Minister 1970‚Äì1974; and Dudley Moore, who read music at Magdalen College, Oxford and went on to a career in acting.

The central theme of the myth holds that there were four other cycles of creation and destruction that preceded the Fifth World. The creation story is taken largely from the mythological, cosmological, and eschatological beliefs and traditions of earlier Mesoamerican cultures. Aztec mythology According to Aztec mythology the present world is a product of four cycles of birth, death, and reincarnation. When each world is destroyed it is reborn through the sacrifice of a god. The god‚Äôs sacrifice creates a new sun, which creates a new world. The myth is sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúLegend of Five Suns.‚Äù Jaguars, a hurricane, fire rain, and a flood destroyed the first four suns. After the fourth sun was destroyed the gods gathered to choose a god to become the new sun. , a boastful and proud god, offered himself up for sacrifice. However, the rest of gods favored , the smallest and humblest god. The gods built a grand fire, but at the last second refused to jump into the fire because he was too afraid of the pain. Instead, jumped in the fire. Embarrassed by ‚Äôs sacrifice, followed him into the fire. The two suns rose in the sky, but they were too bright. The gods threw a rabbit at to dim his light, and he turned into the moon. This is the reason why the Aztec people say there is a rabbit that lives on the moon. Still however, the sun remained motionless in the sky, burning the ground below. The gods then recognized they all must be sacrificed so that the people could survive. The god helped offering them up. The sacrifices made the sun move through the sky, energizing earth instead of burning it. = Human sacrifice = In the Aztec tradition, the Fifth World is the last one and after this one the earth will not be recreated. This is why the Aztecs practised human sacrifice. The gods would only keep the sun alive as long as the Aztecs continued providing them with blood. Their worldview held a deep sense of indebtedness. Blood sacrifice was an often-used form of or debt-payment. Franciscan Friar wrote in his ethnography of Mesoamerica that the victim was someone who \\"gave his service.‚Äù  Navajo mythology  The Navajo, who were neighbors of the Hopi in the southwest, borrow elements of the Pueblo people‚Äôs emergence myths in their creation stories. The Navajo creation story has parallels to the Biblical book of Genesis. The early Judaic-Christian concept of the world is similar to the Navajo concept of the world. This world is one where the earth is an area of land floating in an ocean covered by a domed heaven. The domed heaven fits the land and ocean like a lid with its edges on the horizon. The Navajo creation story traces the evolution of life through four previous worlds until the people reach the fifth and present world. As the humans passed through each of the previous four worlds, they went through evolution. They started out as insects and various animals until they became humans in the Fourth World. Upon arriving in the Fourth World the First Man was not satisfied. The land was barren. He planted a reed and it grew to the roof of the Fourth World. First Man sent the badger up the reed, but water began to drip before he could reach top so he returned. Next a locust climbed the reed. The locust made a headband with two crossed arrows on his forehead. With the help of all the gods the locust reached the Fifth World. When he pushed through mud he reached water and saw a black water bird swimming towards him. The bird told the locust that he could only stay if he could make magic. The locust took the arrows from his headband and pulled them through his body, between his shell and his heart. The black bird was convinced that the locust possessed great medicine, and he swam away taking the water with him. The locust returned to the lower world. Now two days had passed and there was no sun. First Man sent the badger up to the Fifth World again. The badger returned covered with mud from a flood. First Man collected turquoise chips to offer to the five Chiefs of the Winds. They were satisfied with the gift, and they dried the Fifth World. When the badger returned he said that he had come out on dry earth. So First Man led the rest of people to the upper world. So with the explicit help of the gods the people reached the Fifth World similar to the Aztec creation story. Now after all the people had arrived from the lower worlds First Man and First Woman placed the mountain lion on one side and the wolf on the other. They divided the people into two groups. The first group chose the wolf for their chief. The mountain lion was the chief for the other side. The people who had the mountain lion chief turned were to be the people of the Earth. The people with the wolf chief became the animals. Navajo medicine men say there are two worlds above the Fifth World. The first is the World of the Spirits of Living Things and the second is the Place of Melting into One. The Navajo legends are an oral account that is passed down from generation to generation. There are various versions of the story ‚Äî as there are in any oral account ‚Äî but the variations are slight.  Hopi mythology  The Hopi‚Äôs creation myth is slightly different than the creation myths of the Aztecs and Navajo. The Hopi believe we are currently living in the Fourth World, but are on the threshold of the Fifth World. In each of the three previous worlds, humanity was destroyed by destructive practices and wars. In the most common version of the story the Spider Grandmother () caused a reed to grow into the sky, and it emerged in the Fourth World at the , a small tunnel or inter-dimensional passage.

Their goal is to ensure that The Spirit of Alberta remains in full and complete operating condition for the enjoyment of steam rail fans. Society structure and team members The Rocky Mountain Rail Society operates under a board of directors and a varying number of directors. The key mechanical positions that make up the Mechanical Committee are chief mechanical officer, assistant to the chief mechanical officer and rolling stock operations officer. All planning for repairs, modifications and maintenance of any RMRS equipment must be done in consultation with and under the approval of the Mechanical Committee. A volunteer coordinator is also appointed to manage all volunteer resources and scheduling. =Team member roles= * Chief Mechanical Officer ‚Äì Responsible for the planning, scheduling and expenditure of all repairs and maintenance.

Reports to the Board of Directors. * Volunteer Coordinator ‚Äì responsible for managing volunteer resources with respect to training and scheduling. * Volunteer Workers ‚Äì responsible for conducting work on the locomotives and rolling stock under the direction of the Mechanical Committee and Volunteer Coordinator. Society operation The Society's excursions consist of providing 6060 as steam power to a number of runs of Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions (APRE) tourist trains which are operated on a regular weekend schedule from mid-May to mid-October. (Special event runs also occur at other dates in the year). The railway normally uses its own steam locomotive, number 41, or a diesel for these runs but on 12 days each summer RMRS provides 6060 as power. The trips occur along old rail lines of the Canadian Northern Railway between Stettler and Big Valley in Alberta, Canada. The length of this run is 48 miles round trip. As there is no capacity to turn locomotives at the Big Valley end point, 6060 runs in reverse to that location, and then returns in a forward direction to Stettler. History of CNR 6060 6060 (affectionately known as Bullet-nosed Betty) was assembled in Canada's Montreal Locomotive Works in October 1944 under builder's number 72757. In 1959, 6060 was retired from active service and was subsequently placed on static display in Jasper, Alberta in 1962. Ten years later, Canadian National Railway restored 6060 to operating condition, and used her to haul steam excursions out of Toronto, Ontario. In 1980, to commemorate the Province of Alberta's 75th anniversary, 6060 was presented to the people of Alberta as a gift. After more than five years of retirement, she was restored a second time with the help of the Province of Alberta and, most notably, volunteers from the Rocky Mountain Rail Society. 6060 travelled under her own power to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1986 to participate in the Steam Expo, part of the World's Fair. After several years of storage at the Alberta Railway Museum near Edmonton, she was moved to Stettler in 1998 to operate regularly in the service of Alberta Prairie Steam Tours. More than a decade later, she continues to transport thousands of excursion passengers every summer. This impressive mountain-type engine is considered to be one of the best remaining examples of a modern steam locomotive, and, in addition to being Canada's largest operating steamer, is currently North America's only operating mountain-type engine. 6060's design is an extension of CNR Northern U-2-g design (4-8-4) which was able to run through divisional points where other engines would need to be serviced, and established performance records. One such locomotive ran 18,353 miles in one month, and it was typical for the design to run without change from Montreal, Quebec, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, for a total of 841 miles. As a result of being constructed during World War II when the need for more locomotives was high but the ready supply of iron was low, the U-1-f class of 4-8-2s, of which 6060 was the first, were lighter and more versatile locomotives than the U-2 Northerns. 6060 rolled off the erecting floor at Montreal Locomotive Works early in October 1944. In spite of being 20 tons lighter than the U-2s, the performance of the U-1-f class was undiminished and they quickly took over prestigious passenger runs, capable of easily maintaining speeds of 75 mph. 6078, a classmate of 6060, made the run from Toronto to Sarnia, Ontario in two hours and fifty-eight minutes at an average speed (including water stops) of 58.7 mph. This entire sub-class of engine remained in service until the end of steam on the CNR.Excerpts from RMRS policy manual authored by Rich Graydon, R.M.R.S.

She is the first female silversmith to have become internationally noted. Among her most important works are the watch \\"Vivianna,\\" the bracelet \\"Mobius,\\" and the earrings and necklaces \\"Dew Drop.\\" Early life Torun grew up in Malm√∂ with her sculptor mother, town planner father and three older siblings. Her entire family was creative: a sister became a poet and her brother and other sister grew up to become architects. Torun began making jewelry as a teenager. She attended the Stockholm university of arts, crafts and design Konstfackskolan (later renamed Konstfack). She staged her first exhibition at the age of 21. In 1948 she traveled to Paris and Cannes, where she met painters Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Henri Matisse. A few years later she opened her own studio, which made her the first female silversmith in Sweden with her own workshop. Personal life Torun had her first child, Pia, at the age of 18. She later married Pia‚Äôs father, a Danish journalism student, but the marriage was short-lived. In 1948, Torun married her second husband, a French architect, with whom she had a second child, Claude. In 1956 they divorced, and Torun lost custody of Claude to his father. She then remarried and moved to Paris with her third husband, the African-American painter Walter Coleman, with whom she later had two children, Ira and Marcia. In 1958 the family moved to Biot in the south of France to avoid the political problems they were encountering in Paris as a result of the war in Algeria. In 1965 Torun's marriage to Coleman broke up. After the breakup of her third marriage, Torun become a member of the Subud international spiritual movement, and in 1968 she moved to Germany to be nearer to a Subud community. She later moved to Jakarta in Indonesia, where Subud was founded. In 2002, after being diagnosed with leukemia, she left Indonesia to live with her daughter Marcia in Denmark until her death in 2004 at the age of 76. Work and awards Vivianna watch, created 1962 Throughout her career, Torun worked in Sweden, France, Germany and Indonesia. In 1948, saying that she didn't want to design jewelry for the wives of wealthy men to keep locked up in private, Torun began making what she called \\"anti-status jewelry\\" out of twisted silver wire embellished with crystals and stones. In 1959, she designed the Mobius necklace, which included a lead crystal drop to be draped over the shoulder of the wearer. It was described by Barbara Cartlidge, author of the reference book Twentieth Century Jewelry, as a \\"milestone in the history of modern jewelry.\\" In 1962, Torun designed a stainless steel bangle-style wristwatch for an exhibition at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris. It later became the first wristwatch to be produced by the world-renowned Danish silver company Georg Jensen. In 1960, Torun was awarded a gold medal at the 1960 Milan Triennale and also won the American Lunning Prize for design, given annually to innovative Scandinavian designers in their thirties. She then met the Danish silversmith Georg Jensen, for whom she began designing exclusively in 1969. Torun is the designer behind some of the most famous Georg Jensen jewelry designs, including 'Mobius', 'The Vivianna / Open Watch', 'Beans', 'Forget me knot' and 'Hidden Heart'. She is the second most famous Georg Jensen designer, behind Jensen himself. In 1992 she was awarded the Prince Eugen medal by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden for outstanding artistic achievement. Also in 1992, the Georg Jensen form held an exhibition honouring 25 years of its association with Torun, 45 years of her work with silver and her 65th birthday. In the same year, the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in the Louvre held a 45-year retrospective of Torun's work. Torun's jewelry was inspired by natural shapes such as flowers, leaves, swirls and the flow of water. It is described as sober, minimalist and simple. Torun has been praised for her ability to shape solid materials into seemingly flexible forms, so that metal flows like water around the wearer's neck and shoulders. She did not use valuable stones, preferring instead pebbles, granite, rock crystal, moonstone and quartz. Torun's jewelry has been worn by celebrities including Billie Holiday, Ingrid Bergman, and Brigitte Bardot, and her customers included Pablo Picasso and Duke Ellington. Her work can be seen in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm, the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Montreal, the Louvre in Paris, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London, and in the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich. Her jewelry and housewares are sold today by retailers such as Georg Jensen, Bed Bath & Beyond and Amazon.

In the sidesurf position, a straight line can be drawn through both heels and toes with the toes pointing away from each other. The motion is similar to being on a snow board however the toes are both turned outwards. Another term used for sidesurfing is \\"crabbing,\\" as this is similar to the perpendicular style in which a crab moves. Sidesurfing may be done while skating down hills, just like snowboarding, finding natural side hits because gravity naturally accelerates the skater. However, sidesurfers can learn to propel themselves forwards by rotating their hips from side to side while pushing their skates perpendicular to their direction of motion. It is also used in a variety of other roller skating sports, ranging from roller derby to vertical (aggressive and park) skating. Initially, sidesurfing is quite hard and a lot of practice is required, starting with groin stretches. A more advanced version of the sidesurf is called the Sidesurf Royale also known as the Heel-heel side Surf. This is a modification of the sidesurf move where the blader sidesurfs with his or her toes off the ground. There are claims that sidesurf stance was used for slalom cone skating in the early 70's, and that Kenny Means was the first to popularize the style of skating.

In 330 BC, Alexander the Great, marching through the borders of Aria on his way from Hyrcania against the Parthians, was met at a city named Susia by Satibarzanes, who made submission to him, and was rewarded for it by the restoration of his satrapy. In order to prevent the commission of any hostilities against the Arians by the Macedonian troops which were following from the west, Alexander left behind with Satibarzanes forty horse- dartmen, under the command of Anaxippus. These, however, together with their commander, were soon after murdered by the satrap, who excited the Arians to rebellion, and gathered his forces together at the city of Artacoana. On the approach of Alexander, he fled to join the traitor Bessus; and the city, after a short siege, was captured by the Macedonians. Towards the end of the same year (330 BC), Alexander, heard that Satibarzanes had again entered Aria with 2000 horses, supplied by Bessus, and had excited the Arians to another revolt. According to Arrian, upon this, he sent a force against him, led by Artabazus, Erigyius, Caranus, and Andronicus of Olynthus. In a battle which ensued, and of which the issue was yet doubtful, Satibarzanes came forward and defied any one of the enemy's generals to single combat. The challenge was accepted by Erigyius, and Satibarzanes was slain.

The \\"newly formed\\" counties are marked, as are the inland expeditions made 1817‚Äì1840. The Nineteen Counties were the limits of location in the colony of New South Wales, Australia. Settlers were permitted to take up land only within the counties due to the dangers in the wilderness. They were defined by the Governor of New South Wales Ralph Darling in 1826 in accordance with a government order from Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State. Counties had been used since the first year of settlement, with Cumberland County being proclaimed on 6 June 1788. Several others were later proclaimed around the Sydney area. A further order of 1829 extended these boundaries of the settlement to an area defined as the Nineteen Counties. From 1831 the granting of free land ceased and the only land that was to be made available for sale was within the Nineteen Counties. The area covered by the limit extended to Taree in the north, Batemans Bay in the south and Wellington to the West. The Nineteen Counties were mapped by the Surveyor General Major Thomas Mitchell in 1834. The scale of the map that Mitchell produced was determined by the amount of ship's copper available in Sydney to engrave the map.Canberra's Engineering Heritage, William Charles Andrews, Institution of Engineers, Canberra, 1990, p. 3 Despite the uncertainty of land tenure, squatters ran large numbers of sheep and cattle beyond the boundaries. From 1836 they could legally do so, paying ¬£10 per year for the right. From 1847 leases in the unsettled areas were allowed for up to 14 years. The Robertson Land Acts of 1861 allowed unlimited selection and sale of agricultural crown land in designated unsettled areas at ¬£1 per acre, making the limits of location of the nineteen counties redundant. The counties continue to be used for cadastral division purposes, and the rest of New South Wales was likewise divided into counties, totaling 141 by the end of the 19th century.

The map also shows the routes taken by Mitchell's expedition and camps. In January 1819, John Bigge was appointed a special commissioner to examine the government of the colony of New South Wales. Bigge arrived in Sydney in September 1819 gathering evidence until February 1821 when he returned to England. Bigge's first report was published in June 1822 and his second and third reports in 1823. His third report dealt with agriculture and trade. In 1824, Governor Brisbane approved the sale of crown land in accordance with one of Bigge's recommendations. Previously only a nominal quit rent was required for grants by the crown. In 1825, Secretary of State Lord Bathurst instructed Governor Brisbane to survey the territory to allow for more planned settlement. During the survey one seventh of the land in each county was to be set a side for the Church of England and an educational system under the control of the church. Income from this land was to be managed under the Church and Schools Corporation. When Governor Darling was commissioned in July 1825, his commission extended the New South Wales boundary six degrees to the west compared with the commissions issued to previous governors. In September 1826, Darling announced the boundaries within which the survey instructed by Bathurst in 1825 was to be conducted. The boundaries were the Manning River to the north, the Lachlan river to the west and the Moruya river to the south. Settlement beyond these boundaries was not to take place. The survey would allow the allocation of land grants and the boundaries, known as the limits of location, were used for other administrative purposes including police administration. Darling proclaimed the division of the settlement into nineteen countiesGovernment Order, No 50, published in the Sydney Gazette, 17 October 1829. in the Sydney Gazette of 17 October 1829.

See Chancellor of Tang Dynasty for more information. of the Tang dynasty. He initially served as an official of the Sui dynasty and was one of the driving forces in persuading the general Li Yuan to rebel against Emperor Yang of Sui. He eventually assisted Li Yuan in founding the Tang dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu and was greatly honored in Emperor Gaozu's reign. After Emperor Gaozu's son Emperor Taizong became emperor in 626, Pei began to be accused of corruption and associations with witchcraft and was exiled. Emperor Taizong soon remembered Pei's contributions to Tang's founding and tried to recall him, but Pei died before he could do so.  Background  Pei Ji was from Pu Province (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), under Northern Zhou rule during the time of his birth. He was from \\"The Western Juan Pei\\" of the prominent Pei clan of Hedong. His father died early, and he was raised by his older brother. When he was 13, he began serving as the secretary to a commandery governor. He was described to be handsome and having a working knowledge of literature. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui, he became an officer in the guard corps, but was said to be so poor that, in order to report to the capital Chang'an for duty, he had to walk there. During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, he served successively as the census officer of Qi Province (ÈΩäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jinan, Shandong), personal secretary to Emperor Yang, and then the deputy head of the household at Emperor Yang's secondary palace at Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). He had already been friendly with Li Yuan the Duke of Tang, the general in charge at Taiyuan (i.e., Jinyang) previously, and when they were both posted to Taiyuan, Pei and Li became particularly close, often feasting together. He also allowed Li Yuan to, against strict laws, have sexual relations with some of the ladies in waiting at Jinyang Palace, assumed by some historians as the main reason to rebel against Sui dynasty due to fear of severe punishment from the Emperor.  Participation in Li Yuan's rebellion  Meanwhile, Li Yuan's son Li Shimin and Liu Wenjing, the Jinyang County magistrate, were plotting to rebel against Sui rule, but initially neither dared to discuss the matter with Li Yuan. They saw that Pei was closest to Li Yuan, and therefore had their confederate Gao Binlian (È´òÊñåÂªâ) gamble with Pei and intentionally lose to him. After Gao got sufficiently close to Pei, he informed Pei of Li Shimin's and Liu's plot, and managed to persuade Pei to join. Pei, in turn, persuaded Li Yuan that he had to rebel against Emperor Yang. Li Yuan agreed, and did so in summer 617. Once he did, Pei, who had considerably personal wealth and further had control of the storage facility, offered a large supply of rice, silk, and armor, as well as 500 ladies in waiting, to Li Yuan. On Li Yuan's subsequent march toward Chang'an, Pei served as Li Yuan's secretary, and Li Yuan created him the Duke of Wenxi. Later in 617, Li Yuan was attacking Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, in modern Yuncheng) but could not capture it quickly, and there were rumors that Eastern Tujue and a rebel ruler it supported, Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, would attack Taiyuan. At that time, Pei advocated withdrawing back to Taiyuan and defend it. Li Shimin and another son of Li Yuan, Li Jiancheng, however believed that retreat would lead to inevitable defeat and therefore successfully persuaded Li Yuan not to retreat. Instead, per Pei's suggestions, after Li Yuan subsequently defeated Sui forces at Huoyi (ÈúçÈÇë, also in modern Yuncheng), he left part of his army to siege Hedong, while himself crossing the Yellow River into Guanzhong (i.e., the Chang'an region). After Li Yuan captured Chang'an later that year and declared Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai emperor (as Emperor Gong), he himself served as regent, and he awarded Pei with fields, a mansion, and the title of Duke of Wei.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  In 618, Emperor Yang was killed in a coup at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When news of Emperor Yang's death reached Chang'an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. When he took the throne, he stated to Pei Ji, \\"The person who brought me here is you, Duke.\\" He made Pei the Right Shangshu Puye (Â∞öÊõ∏ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the two deputy heads of the executive bureau of the government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) -- a post that (at least in later times) was considered a post for a chancellor, and bestowed Pei with great treasures. He also commissioned Pei and Liu Wenjing to revise the Sui laws. Soon, however, Pei and Liu, who were previously friends, became enemies over their conflicting suggestions, and Liu was dissatisfied that he was ranked below Pei. Subsequently, Liu was accused of using witchcraft to try to change his situation, and while Li Shimin and the officials Xiao Yu and Li Gang (ÊùéÁ∂±) all argued that Liu was not committing treason and should be spared, Emperor Gaozu, at Pei's suggestion, nevertheless executed Liu. In 619, Liu Wuzhou captured Taiyuan, forcing Emperor Gaozu's son Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi to flee. Liu then advanced south deep into Tang territory. Pei volunteered to lead the army against Liu. However, when he engaged Liu's general Song Jin'gang (ÂÆãÈáëÂâõ) at Dusuo Plain (Â∫¶Á¥¢Âéü, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), Song cut off his water supplies and then defeated him, and he lost most of his soldiers. He had to flee to Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). He sent a submission to Emperor Gaozu, requesting to be punished, but Emperor Gaozu did not punish him and continued to keep him in command of the forces in the region. However, Pei, who was described to be fearful and not a capable general, was reduced to ordering the people into fortified cities, leaving the countryside for Liu to control and causing the dissatisfied people to rebel against Tang. The situation became sufficiently severe that Emperor Gaozu considered abandoning the entire modern Shanxi region. Li Shimin, however, argued that was inadvisable, and he led an army against Liu and Song, gradually fighting back and defeating Liu in 620, forcing Liu to flee to Eastern Tujue. Meanwhile, Emperor Gaozu summoned Pei back to Chang'an and put him under arrest briefly, but soon released him and continued to honor him. When Emperor Gaozu was away from Chang'an, he often had Pei in charge of the capital in his absence. In 621, when Emperor Gaozu began minting new coins, he bestowed one mint press on Pei, allowing Pei to mint his own money, and he also took a daughter of Pei's to be the wife and princess of his son Li Yuanjing (ÊùéÂÖÉÊôØ) the Prince of Zhao. (Li Shimin and Li Yuanji, who were each granted three presses, were the only other individuals permitted to mint their own money.) During the years, Pei offered several times to retire, and in 626, Emperor Gaozu granted him the honorific title of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫) and allowed him to effectively retire, but further continued to set up rotations of junior officials from the executive bureau who would attend to Pei on a daily basis.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 626, Li Shimin, then locked in an intense rivalry with Li Jiancheng (who, as the older brother, was crown prince), feared that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him, and ambushed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji (who supported Li Jiancheng) at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). Although Pei Ji appeared to have supported Li Jiancheng in the struggle, Emperor Taizong initially continued to honor him, and on one occasion, when Emperor Taizong was offering sacrifices to heaven outside the capital, he requested Pei and Zhangsun Wuji to ride with him in the imperial wagon, a great honor at the time. In 629, however, when the Buddhist monk Faya (Ê≥ïÈõÖ) was accused to have spread false teachings (probably treasonous teachings) to the people and was executed, Pei was accused of having heard of the false teachings but not reported it, and therefore was removed from his honorific title of Sikong and ordered to retire to his home in Pu Prefecture. When Pei requested to stay at Chang'an, Emperor Taizong rebuked him: :Duke, your contributions were not commensurate with your position; you only rose to this honored position due to your relationship with Taishang Huang [(i.e., Emperor Gaozu, now retired emperor)]. There were times during the reign of Wude [(Ê≠¶Âæ∑, Emperor Gaozu's era name)] when the government was corrupt and poorly run, and it was your fault. Now I am allowing you to return to your home. Why do you complain? Once Pei returned to Pu Prefecture, an insane man named Xin Xing (‰ø°Ë°å) stated to one of Pei's servants that he believed that Pei would be emperor. When Pei's servant reported this to the head servant, and the head servant in turn informed Pei, Pei, fearful, had Xin and the junior servant killed. Subsequently, the head servant embezzled money from Pei and feared punishment, and therefore reported the incident to Emperor Taizong. In anger, Emperor Taizong stated: :Pei Ji has four deadly crimes. One, even though he was one of the Three Excellencies, he associated with witches. Second, after he was removed from his post, he angrily stated that the empire rose only because of him. Third, he failed to disclose the wicked words. Four, he killed people to stop them from speaking. I have reasons to execute him. Many people spoke on Pei's behalf, and Emperor Taizong did not execute him, but exiled him to Jing Prefecture (ÈùúÂ∑û, roughly modern Heishui county in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan - see Jiu Tang Shu Ch Ch 45). At that time, the Qiang tribesmen in the region rebelled, and rumor arrived at Chang'an that they had taken Pei to be their leader. Emperor Taizong responded, \\"I have spared Pei, and he will surely not do this.\\" Soon, news arrived that Pei had led his servants in defeating the Qiang. Emperor Taizong, remembering Pei's contributions, issued an order recalling him to the capital, but before he could do so, Pei died. Emperor Taizong granted him a number of posthumous honors, including the title of Duke of Hedong.

Porter (May 1, 1792 ‚Äì August 13, 1884) was an American painter, inventor, and founder of Scientific American magazine.Obituary in Scientific American, November 8, 1884 (text reproduced in full on Talk page) Famous family Rufus Porter descended from an old colonial New England family. The family's first immigrants to the US were Mary and John Porter (-1676) who emigrated from Dorset, England to Salem, Massachusetts in the early 17th century. When John died in 1676 he was the largest landowner around, owning property that included the modern cities of Salem, Danvers, Wenham, Beverly, Topsfield and Boxford, Massachusetts. Later descendants included Benjamin Porter, who was Rufus' great-grandfather. Benjamin moved to West Boxford in 1716 and became the wealthiest man there. His descendants include ministers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, an army colonel, a ship's captain, a professor of mathematics and several legislative members. He was related by marriage to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the Honorable Rufus King (minister to England) and Harriet Porter Beecher, stepmother of Harriet Beecher Stowe. The family farm descended to Abigail and Tyler Porter, parents of Rufus Porter. Birth and education Porter was born in West Boxford, Massachusetts. He was one of six children. His father was Tyler Porter and his mother was Abigail Johnson. Rufus started school at age 4. The family farm was sold in 1801 and the family moved to Maine when Rufus was 9 years old. They lived in Pleasant Mountain Gore, now part of Bridgton. At age 12 Rufus attended the Fryeburg Academy for six months. In 1807 he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Marriage In 1815 Rufus married Eunice Twombly (-1848) of Portland, Maine, and they had ten children together, including: Stephen Twombly Porter (1816-1850); Rufus King Porter (1820-1903); Sylvanus Frederick Porter (1823-?); John Randolph Porter (1825-?); Edward Leroy Porter (1827-?); Nancy Adams Porter (1829-1877); Ellen Augusta Porter (1831-?); and Washington Irving Porter (1834-1836). Travel By 1816 Porter was living in New Haven, Connecticut, where he had a dancing school and began painting portraits. In 1818‚Äì1819 he made a trading voyage to the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii, and in 1819 Porter had returned to painting. He traveled by coach and on foot, painting portraits throughout New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. He became a prolific muralist between 1825 and 1845, decorating some 160 houses and inns in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and as far south as Virginia. From simple silhouettes to scenes of entire towns or harbors, Porter spread his art throughout New England. His murals were generally executed in a large scale on dry plaster walls by a combination of freehand painting and stenciling. Some murals were in full color, others in monochrome, with the foliage sometimes stamped in with a cork stopper instead of being painted with a brush. Often he would do portraits of the principal household members where he was doing the murals. Second marriage In 1849 he married Emma Tallman Edgar (1820-?) of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and fathered an additional six children. All the children died in infancy except Rufus Frank Porter (1859-?), also known as Frank Rufus Porter. Inventor During much of this time, and afterwards, Porter was a prolific inventor. His obituary described his \\"long career of usefulness as an inventor of turbine water wheels, windmills, flying ships, rotary engines, and sundry contrivances for abolishing as far as possible agricultural labor.\\" During 1825-1826 he published four editions of A Select Collection of Valuable and Curious Arts, and Interesting Experiments. He built a portable camera obscura that let him make silhouette portraits in less than 15 minutes. (He charged 20 cents apiece for them.) He experimented with a wind-powered gristmill, a washing machine, a corn sheller, a fire alarm, a rope-making machine, and a camera. He invented clocks, railway signals, churns, a distance measuring appliance, a horsepower mechanism, a churn, a life preserver, a cheese press, and a revolving rifle. Porter was noted as missing opportunities to turn his inventions into commercial success. He invented the revolving rifle but sold the rights to Samuel Colt for $100, and the design was permanently shelved. Scientific American In 1841 he bought an interest in the New York mechanic, which he published and edited in New York. The first issue of this magazine was published on 1841-01-02, and was subtitled the advocate of industry and enterprise, and journal of mechanical, and other scientific improvements. After 23 weekly issues Porter moved the magazine to Boston and renamed it American mechanic, with the same sub-title. In this journal he published his plans for the rotary plow, hot air ventilation system, and advertised his general patent agency run in connection with the paper. The magazine survived through 106 issues, the last known one being on 1843-01-21.Union list of serials..., third edition, New York, H. W. Wilson, 1965, vol. 1, p. 278Frederick Converse Beach, editor, The Americana, 1904-1906, at vol. 12, under \\"Porter, Rufus\\" In 1845 he started a new weekly, Scientific American, but 10 months later sold it to Orson Desaix Munn and Alfred Ely Beach.

Airship In 1849 Porter planned to build an 800-foot steam-powered airship with accommodations for 50 to 100 passengers, aiming to convey miners to the California Gold Rush. He had already built and flown several scale models in Boston and New York. He advertised New York-to-California service, asking a $50 down payment for a $200 fare, and began building immediately. His first \\"aeroport\\" was 240 feet long; it was destroyed by a tornado. Later that year, he began a 700-foot version with new backers, but during a showing of the almost-complete dirigible on Thanksgiving Day, rowdy visitors tore the hydrogen bag and destroyed it. In 1854 his third attempt ended with technical troubles. Death and legacy Porter died on August 13, 1884 at the home of his son, Rufus Frank Porter (1859-?), in West Haven, Connecticut. He was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, West Haven, Connecticut. Porter's obituary in the Scientific American described his remarkable life and \\"abnormally busy career\\", which had seen 21 American Presidents take office. The magazine pronounced \\"he has gone to the grave leaving a name 'writ in water,' we still think that in the world of invention his name will be fully blazoned as a material benefactor to his fellow men... We may add in conclusion that although he has not in any sense attained the fame and eminence of Morse, a Howe, or Edison, Rufus Porter will live as one of the best and brightest examples of the versatility of American invention.\\"  Writings  *1825 A Select Collection of Valuable and Curious Arts, and Interesting Experiments *1849 Aerial Navigation: The Practicality of Traveling Pleasantly and Safely from New York to California in Three Days  Murals by Porter  * Birchwood Inn, Temple, New Hampshire * Daniel Carr House, North Haverhill, New Hampshire * Benjamin Cleaves House, Bridgton, Maine (Rufus Porter Museum) * Eaton House, Bradford, New Hampshire * Hancock Inn, Hancock, New Hampshire * Kent House, Lyme, New Hampshire * Prescott Homestead, Jaffrey, New Hampshire * Reed Homestead, Townsend, Massachusetts * Walter Russell House, Ashburnham, Massachusetts; part of the Cambridge Grant Historic District * Mural House, Greene, Maine * Damon Tavern, North Reading, Massachusetts References Further reading * Lipman, Jean, Rufus Porter Rediscovered; Clarkson W.

History  The name Wallumbilla was the name of a pastoral run leased by Charles Coxen, The name is presumed to come from the indigenous Mandandanji language and reportedly means wallu=plenty and billa=jew fish. Wallumbilla Provisional School opened on 25 October 1893, becoming Wallumbilla State School on 1 September 1894. At the , Wallumbilla had a population of 285. In the 2011 census, Wallumbilla had a population of 262 people. Wallumbilla, March 2010, looking to the nor-nor- east.

Economy  Traditionally Wallumbilla's main industries were dairy and beef cattle, now the main industries are cropping and beef cattle. The main crops include sorghum and wheat. Locals believe that if not for the discovery of gas at nearby hub Roma, Wallumbilla would have flourished into a similar hub, as the discovery of gas in 1908 near Roma preluded the Wallumbilla cattle sale yards (a thriving business according to local history) to move up to Roma, accentuating its growth. A major gas hub is in preparation for Wallumbilla, planned to start operation in 2014.

It is the historical military centre of Macau. The fort forms part of the \\"Historic Centre of Macau\\" and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort was built between 1617 and 1626 on the 52 metres tall Mount Hill, located directly east of the Ruins of St. Paul's. It was constructed to protect the properties of the Jesuits (mainly Portuguese Jesuits) in Macau, especially from pirates. Later, the fort was taken over by the Portuguese colonial governor and the relevant authorities for the defence of Macau. The fort occupies an area of roughly 8,000 square metres. 32 muzzle-loading cannons were placed around the fort's walls and the two corners of the southeastern fort wall have small watchtowers. The fort proved crucial in successfully holding off the attempted Dutch invasion of Macau in 1622. The fort remained a restricted military area until 1965 when the barracks in the fort were converted into a weather observatory and was opened to the public. The observatory ceased its function and was relocated to Taipa in 1996 before it was demolished to make way for the Museum of Macau, which was officially opened on 19 April 1998. The tree- covered park at the top of the fort has a panoramic view of the mainland area of Macau. Apart from being a fortress, it has served various functions: * The first residence of the Governors of Macau (in 1623 and in 1740). * The base for two companies of the Portuguese Prince Regent Battalion to act as a police force from 1810 to 1841. * A weather observatory of the Meteorological Department of Portuguese Macau (from 1966 to 1996). * The Museum of Macau (1998 to present-day).

History The founder was Thomas Clark, who had a Free Church of Scotland background and the company was originally concerned with law and foreign literature. In the 1830s, it began to develop a theology list, taking a progressive Evangelical stance and at times, publishing books that were not likely to make a profit. Its most substantial projects were the English translation of the Ante-Nicene Fathers and the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics. These were only viable because of the existence of a large American market; however, in the 1880s the firm got into a dispute with the Fleming H. Revell Company, over the American firm's copyright violation of some of T&T; Clark's titles. The Ante-Nicene Library was bootlegged by the Christian Literature Publishing Company, based in New York City, New York. However, this did not prevent T&T; Clark from doing business with them. In 1965, the company began to publish Concilium, an academic journal of Roman Catholic theology. In 2003, the three religious academic imprints of Sheffield Academic Press, Trinity Press International and T&T; Clark were united under one imprint.

The club colours are orange and black and the team currently plays in the Belgian First Division B, the second division of Belgian football, having won promotion from the Belgian First Amateur Division in 2020. Their home stadium is the 7,515-capacity Burgemeester Van de Wiele Stadion. History The club was founded on 12 March 1926. On 20 March, the recognition of the Belgian Football Association was received, the club was assigned SK number 818 as SK Deinze. Some important figures during the foundation were children's car manufacturer Emile Torck, his son Georges Torck and garage owner Albert Van Den Poel. They played on a site near Astenedreef. In the following years Deinze almost always played in the higher provincial series. In 1940 the activities were interrupted, the site had been transformed into a junkyard. During the Second World War, the association was further expanded under President Georges Torck and Vice President Achiel De Clercq, as well as hockey, swimming and table tennis. From 1946 it was kept with football again. In the following years, the club's rise continued, playing in the national promotion series or in the highest provincial series. In 1978 the team moved to the new Burgemeester Van de Wiele Stadium in De Brielmeersen, laid out by the city council. In 1982 Deinze last played in the provincial departments, that year another promotion to promotion was enforced. In 1988, Georges Torck retired as chairman, CEO Marc Hoste succeeded him. In 1992 and 1993, Deinze celebrated two consecutive championship titles, making it second national. In 1997, the club reached the final round under the leadership of trainer Eddy Mestdagh, but a promotion to first class did not work. In 2001 Deinze only through additional sports grounds could ensure conservation in second class, when KFC Turnhout (become the second was) received a license from the Belgian FA and relegated. At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Deinze relegated to third division, where it spent six seasons. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Deinze was allowed to participate in the final round for promotion, but lost to ROC de Charleroi-Marchienne. Three years later, Deinze also fought for promotion via the final round. The club had only finished thirteenth that season, but had won a period title. In the final round was lost to KRC Mechelen. A year later (season 2013‚Äì14) Deinze took part in the final round again, but lost to Union Saint-Gilloise. A year later, the promotion to second class finally followed.

It should not be confused with false pregnancy, where a person mistakenly believes that they are pregnant.  Techniques  People who wish to look pregnant, generally for social, sexual, entertainment, or psychological purposes, have the option of body suits and the like to wear under their clothes. It can be done by using pillows or pads, or light- weighing, small balls with a round shape to simulate a pregnant abdomen. A common practice is to place a form replicating a belly (rolled up clothes, deflated ball, etc.) under a skin colored, tight bodysuit. This creates a realistic color and shape.  Reasons  The reasons for a person to desire a simulated pregnancy vary greatly from one individual to another. It could be an intellectual curiosity, a cosmetic effect or social experiment, an erotic or sexual experience, or part of a larger psychological issue. A simulated pregnancy may in some cases be a manifestation of factitious disorder.

Treyarnon Bay Treyarnon has a car park (often full at busy times), toilet facilities and a useful shop (Treyarnon Bay Beach Store). It is a popular spot for bodyboarding, where most surfers go to the beach next door, Constantine Bay. Dogs are allowed all year around and there is lifeguard cover in the summer. The beach has a very dangerous left hand side. The tide comes in very quickly around the island on the left hand side, often leaving people cut off from the mainland. It has a partially constructed rockpool which acts as a swimming pool for older children at low tide. The headland at the end of the beach features an island (Trethias Island) which is completely separated from the mainland by a steep, deep gulley. The gulley can be easily explored at low tide and there are plenty of jumping opportunities. At the end of the gulley on the left, there is an opening which leads to a large cave, this cave extends through the entire headland and emerges into the cove adjacent to Treyarnon. It is only accessible at low tide however and is extremely dangerous otherwise. Many clifftop benches are dedicated to relatives of locals and visitors 'who loved this place'. 'Lark song and sea sound in the air, and splendour, splendour everywhere' is one inscription on a bench between Treyarnon and Constantine Bays.

It was founded by James Burns in 1835, originally as a bookseller. Burns was of Presbyterian background and he gained a reputation as a High Church publisher, producing works by the Tractarians. In 1847 his business was put in jeopardy when he converted to Catholicism, but the firm was fortunate to receive the support of John Henry Newman, who chose the firm to publish many of his works. There is a story that Newman's novel Loss and Gain was written specifically to assist Burns. After a while trading as Burns, James Burns took a partner, renaming the company Burns & Lambert. In 1866 they were joined by a younger man, William Wilfred Oates, making the company Burns, Lambert & Oates and later Burns & Oates. Oates was another Catholic convert, and had previously co-founded the publishing house of Austin & Oates based in Bristol. Burns & Oates passed to his son Wilfred Oates, whose sister Mother Mary Salome became one of the firm‚Äôs most successful authors. The company was designated ‚ÄòPublishers to the Holy See‚Äô by Pope Leo XIII. In the USA the company's agent was The Catholic Publications Society of New York.

In other words, tonicity is the relative concentration of solutes dissolved in solution which determine the direction and extent of diffusion. It is commonly used when describing the response of cells immersed in an external solution. Unlike osmotic pressure, tonicity is influenced only by solutes that cannot cross the membrane, as only these exert an effective osmotic pressure. Solutes able to freely cross the membrane do not affect tonicity because they will always equilibrate with equal concentrations on both sides of the membrane without net solvent movement. It is also a factor affecting imbibition. There are three classifications of tonicity that one solution can have relative to another: hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic. Hypertonic solution A red blood cell in a hypertonic solution, causing water to move out of the cell. A hypertonic solution has a greater concentration of solutes than another solution. In biology, the tonicity of a solution usually refers to its solute concentration relative to that of another solution on the opposite side of a cell membrane; a solution outside of a cell is called hypertonic if it has a greater concentration of solutes than the cytosol inside the cell. When a cell is immersed in a hypertonic solution, osmotic pressure tends to force water to flow out of the cell in order to balance the concentrations of the solutes on either side of the cell membrane. The cytosol is conversely categorized as hypotonic, opposite of the outer solution. When plant cells are in a hypertonic solution, the flexible cell membrane pulls away from the rigid cell wall, but remains joined to the cell wall at points called plasmodesmata. The cells often take on the appearance of a pincushion, and the plasmodesmata almost cease to function because they become constricted, a condition known as plasmolysis. In plant cells the terms isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic cannot strictly be used accurately because the pressure exerted by the cell wall significantly affects the osmotic equilibrium point. Some organisms have evolved intricate methods of circumventing hypertonicity. For example, saltwater is hypertonic to the fish that live in it. Because the fish need a large surface area in their gills in contact with seawater for gas exchange, they lose water osmotically to the sea from gill cells. They respond to the loss by drinking large amounts of saltwater, and actively excreting the excess salt. This process is called osmoregulation. Hypotonic solution A red blood cell in a hypotonic solution, causing water to move into the cell. A hypotonic solution has a lower concentration of solutes than another solution. In biology, a solution outside of a cell is called hypotonic if it has a lower concentration of solutes relative to the cytosol. Due to osmotic pressure, water diffuses into the cell, and the cell often appears turgid, or bloated. For cells without a cell wall such as animal cells, if the gradient is large enough, the uptake of excess water can produce enough pressure to induce cytolysis, or rupturing of the cell. When plant cells are in a hypotonic solution, the central vacuole takes on extra water and pushes the cell membrane against the cell wall. Due to the rigidity of the cell wall, it pushes back, preventing the cell from bursting. This is called turgor pressure. Isotonicity Depiction of a red blood cell in an isotonic solution. A solution is isotonic when its effective osmole concentration is the same as that of another solution. In biology, the solutions on either side of a cell membrane are isotonic if the concentration of solutes outside the cell is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cell. In this case the cell neither swells nor shrinks because there is no concentration gradient to induce the diffusion of large amounts of water across the cell membrane. Water molecules freely diffuse through the plasma membrane in both directions, and as the rate of water diffusion is the same in each direction, the cell will neither gain nor lose water. An iso-osmolar solution can be hypotonic if the solute is able to penetrate the cell membrane. For example, an iso-osmolar urea solution is hypotonic to red blood cells, causing their lysis. This is due to urea entering the cell down its concentration gradient, followed by water. The osmolarity of normal saline, 9 grams NaCl dissolved in water to a total volume of one liter, is a close approximation to the osmolarity of NaCl in blood (about 290 mOsm/L). Thus, normal saline is almost isotonic to blood plasma. Neither sodium nor chloride ions can freely pass through the plasma membrane, unlike urea.

The village is comprised to a large extent of second homes, and is quiet for much of the year. The Gold Lunulae of Harlyn Gunver Head In 1865 a labourer found two wafer-thin crescents of gold known as lunulae at Harlyn Bay. They probably date from the early Bronze Age, and were probably deposited as grave goods, as there are several prehistoric burial mounds nearby. The shape of these lunulae indicates a symbolic meaning. They represent the crescent horns of the moon, and may thus have been objects of great ritual and ceremonial significance.Golden treasures from Cornwall‚Äôs past; by Cheryl Straffon The site of the finds was above Onjohn Cove, a small cove between Harlyn Bay and Cataclews Point at .

Daughters of a monarch are actually referred to by other terms, e.g. , literally king's daughter, even though Hime can be used to address ≈åjo. The word Hime initially referred to any beautiful female. In some languages, the word also means a sound that a girl makes when in distress. The antonym of Hime is Shikome (ÈÜúÂ•≥), literally ugly female, though it is archaic and rarely used. Hime may also indicate feminine or simply small when used together with other words, such as Hime-gaki (a low line of hedge). Hime is commonly seen as part of a Japanese female divinity's name, such as Toyotama-hime. The Kanji applied to transliterate Hime are ÊØîÂ£≤ or ÊØòÂ£≤ rather than Âß´. The masculine counterpart of Hime is Hiko (ÂΩ¶, ÊØîÂè§ or ÊØòÂè§,) which is seen as part of Japanese male gods' names, such as Saruta-hiko. Unlike Hime, Hiko is neutral, non-archaic and still commonly used as a modern Japanese male given name, for example Nobuhiko Takada. Proverb *Ichi hime ni taro \\"First baby, a girl. Second baby, a boy\\": It originally meant that having a girl first, and a boy second was easier on the mother as she gained experience before nurturing a boy. However, with each household having fewer children, this is commonly confused as having \\"one girl and two boys\\", or three children. This is because \\"ichi\\" means \\"one\\" in Japanese and \\"ni\\" means \\"two\\" in Japanese, and therefore could be read as, \\"One girl, two boys.\\" Usage While many use the name Hime to address those of a higher or more noble birth, there are a few who use it as a girl's name. Thus some names either incorporate the word Hime or the giver simply will name said girl Hime.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 2, 1991. In the episode, Homer gets drunk at a dinner party and embarrasses Marge, so she enrolls them in marriage counseling at a lakeside retreat with Reverend Lovejoy. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mark Kirkland. It was the last episode Kirkland directed during his first year on the show. Although not named until season three's \\"Black Widower\\", the character Snake Jailbird appeared for the first time in this episode. \\"The War of the Simpsons\\" features songs such as Tom Jones's \\"It's Not Unusual\\", Dusty Springfield's \\"The Look of Love\\", KC and the Sunshine Band's \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\", and Glen Campbell's \\"Wichita Lineman\\". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.6 and was the second highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. Plot During a party at the Simpsons' house, Homer humiliates himself by getting drunk, insulting guests, and leering at Maude Flanders' cleavage. At church the next day, Marge signs up for marriage counseling at a weekend retreat hosted by Reverend Lovejoy and his wife Helen. When Homer learns the retreat will be held at Catfish Lake, he packs his fishing equipment, but Marge tells him they are only attending to resolve their marital problems. On the way to the retreat, Homer stops at a bait shop and learns of the legendary catfish General Sherman. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to fish, but Marge is upset that he would choose fishing over their marriage. Instead of returning to bed, Homer takes a walk and finds an abandoned fishing pole on a dock. As he grabs the pole with General Sherman on the line, the fish yanks him from the pier into a small rowboat and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge grows angry watching Homer battle General Sherman. Marge attends the marriage workshops alone while Homer triumphantly docks with General Sherman aboard the boat. When Homer returns, Marge tells him their marriage is in serious trouble if he values fishing more than his wife. To prove his love for her, Homer releases the fish, which swims away. While Marge and Homer are away, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their grandfather into letting them throw a party. After the party ends, the house is a total mess. When Grampa cries, they fear their mess will land him in trouble with their parents, so they frantically clean the house. Once home, Marge praises Grampa for the house's cleanliness. He reveals his secret is \\"pretending to cry\\" to con his grandchildren into cleaning it. Bart and Lisa realize they were tricked as Grampa leaves while laughing at them. Production This episode was written by John Swartzwelder. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and it was the last episode Mark Kirkland directed during his first year on the show. Kirkland and his animation team were relatively new to animation when they began working on the show, and to make the animation in this episode the best they had ever done, they incorporated all the techniques they had learned during their first year into it. Kirkland said animating Homer drunk was a challenge for him as he had to analyze how people behave when they are intoxicated by alcohol. He said of the animation: \\"I shifted [Homer's] eyes open and close, they're not working in sync. And of course Homer can't keep his balance so that's why he's shifting back and forth.\\" Kirkland was raised in New York in an environment similar to the one where the marriage retreat was held. He therefore enjoyed drawing and overseeing the scenery for the episode, and the bait shop was based on the bait shops he visited when he grew up. Snake Jailbird, Springfield's resident recidivist felon, appeared for the first time on the show in this episode, though he was not named until season three's \\"Black Widower\\". He appears at Bart and Lisa's wild house party. A woman named Gloria who seeks marriage counseling at the retreat was voiced by Julie Kavner. It is one of the few times in the history of the show that Kavner has voiced a character other than Marge and her relatives. Gloria's hair was based on Kirkland's assistant director Susie Dietter's. The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss said on the episode's DVD audio commentary that while the episode was \\"full of funny moments\\", it caused \\"nothing but trouble\\" for the staff. One of those troubles was that after the episode had been written by Swartzwelder, an unsolicited writer sent them a script containing a virtually identical story. To avoid a lawsuit, the staff paid him US$3000 and went forward with theirs. Material cut from the episode's script included many couples who were supposed to be at the retreat instead of the Flanders family, such as Mr. Burns and his mail-order bride, and Mrs. Krabappel trying to reunite with her estranged husband Ken Krabappel. Reiss said the scene played out \\"horribly badly\\", and it appeared as if Mr. Burns's mail-order bride was a prostitute. The Ken Krabappel character was supposed to be based on singer Dean Martin, but somehow he ended up with a southern accent that made him sound like a hick. The whole scene was rewritten with help from producer James L. Brooks and it was completed after several hours. A scene in which Moe asked Dr. Hibbert to cure his discolored feces was also removed during the first reading of the script after a complaint by Brooks. Series creator Matt Groening later expressed an objection to the ending, which sees General Sherman jumping out of the water and winking at the camera, believing it to be overly cartoony. Cultural references Tom Cruise's bartending stunts in Cocktail are referenced in the episode. The way Ned Flanders prepares the cocktails at the party is similar to actor Tom Cruise's bartending stunts in the 1988 film Cocktail. p. 55. Songs heard at the party include Tom Jones's \\"It's Not Unusual\\" (1965), Dusty Springfield's \\"The Look of Love\\" (1967), KC and the Sunshine Band's \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\" (1975), and Glen Campbell's \\"Wichita Lineman\\" (1968). Homer's false memory of the party the following day (in which he imagines himself as being erudite and witty instead of drunk) is a reference to the Algonquin Round Table, a group of New York City writers, critics, actors, and wits. The \\"Mexican Hat Dance\\" song is heard when Marge turns on the radio in the car to mute the conversation between herself and Homer so the children cannot hear them fight. When Homer comes into the church late, while looking for his chair, a character who strikes a resemblance to Adolf Hitler is seen. In a flashback sequence, Bart remembers chasing away a screaming babysitter with the car as a toddler. This sequence and the music in it are references to a scene in the 1976 film The Omen, in which the Devil's child Damien makes animals shriek in terror as Damien approaches. The picture of General Sherman at the bait shop is a reference to the famous hoax picture of the Loch Ness Monster. John and Gloria are a reference to George and Martha from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Homer's attempt at catching General Sherman, his bludgeoning of the fish and the line \\"I love you but I have to kill you\\" are all based on Santiago's fight with the marlin in Ernest Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea. The battle between Homer and General Sherman is also reminiscent of Captain Ahab's battle with the white whale Moby-Dick in the novel Moby-Dick. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The War of the Simpsons\\" finished fortieth in the ratings for the week of April 29 to May 5, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 11.6, equivalent to approximately 10.8 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on Fox that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the twelfth best episode of the show with a sports theme (sport fishing). The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the Homer vs. Marge plot was \\"good on its own\\", but it was also \\"Grampa's big moment. His final revelation to Bart and Lisa is inspired.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the main concern with the episode \\"stemmed from its start. The scenes at the party were so terrific that the episode could have tanked after that. Happily, it didn't, as the show provided a consistently high level of entertainment. Between Homer's excesses at marriage camp and the kids' antics while Grampa watches them, the program packed in a ton of great gags.\\" In a review of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said \\"The War of the Simpsons\\" felt \\"a bit flat\\", but \\"even in [its] lowest points, humor is easy to find\\". Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said it was \\"another great episode, featuring first, a new level of Homer's debauchery after drinking way too much at a party the Simpsons host, Reverend Lovejoy's marital retreat, and an epic battle with a legendary fish named General Sherman. Each of these portions of the episode are filled with laughs, perhaps the funniest being Homer's distorted high-society recollection of the previous night's events in which he is hailed as charming and a jolly good fellow.\\" References External links *\\"The War of the Simpsons\\" at The Simpsons.com  1991 American television episodes The Simpsons (season 2) episodes Television shows written by John Swartzwelder ","title":"The War of the Simpsons"},{"id":"2823835","text":"Arnprior Water Aerodrome, , is located south of the community and is open from May until November.

The railway operates excursion trains over a route between the historic towns of Stouffville and Uxbridge. The round trip takes approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes. The railway runs on the tracks of the former Toronto and Nipissing Railway. Metrolinx owns and operates the line south from Stouffville GO Station as the Stouffville line. Operations The York‚ÄìDurham Heritage Railway operates non-stop between the Uxbridge Station on the Metrolinx Uxbridge Subdivision and Stouffville GO Station. Between Lincolnville GO Station and Stouffville, trains operate over the same tracks as the GO Transit Stouffville line commuter rail service. The railway runs on occasion between the Old Unionville Station and the Markham GO Station, as it did in June 2018. Neither station serves this run with the former's platform fenced off from the tracks. Trains are scheduled on weekends from June through mid-October, and are pulled by an Alco RS-11 diesel locomotive, #3612, which was built for the Duluth, Winnipeg & Pacific Railway in 1956. Coaches include both vintage heavyweights built in the 1910s and 1920s, and lightweight cars from 1954. The railway cars are stored at an open rail yard on Railway Street/King Street West in Uxbridge, Ontario. Several railway sheds are on the yard. The most significant is the Uxbridge Station, built in 1904.http://www.realontario.ca/index.php/ontario-tourism-listing?pid=11668 The YDHR is operated entirely by volunteers of the York‚ÄìDurham Heritage Railway Association. Railway History The Uxbridge Subdivision was built in 1871 as the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, a narrow-gauge line. The line was converted to shortly after being acquired by the Midland Railway in 1882. Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, the line became part of the Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1923. In the 1980s, CN began to abandon the line. Tracks north of Uxbridge were lifted, but the line south of Uxbridge was purchased by GO Transit (now Metrolinx) to preserve it for possible Uxbridge - Toronto commuter rail service. Until such a service is introduced, the York- Durham Railway is the sole operator north of Lincolnville station.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 9, 1991. In the episode, Bart sees the rare first issue of Radioactive Man for sale at a comic book convention. Unable to afford it, he convinces Martin and Milhouse to pool their money to buy the valuable comic, only to see it destroyed by their selfishness and inability to share. This episode contains the first appearance of the Android's Dungeon and its owner, Comic Book Guy. The episode was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Wes Archer. It features cultural references to comic book characters such as Richie Rich and Casper the Friendly Ghost. Several new characters make their first appearance on the show in the episode, including Comic Book Guy, Radioactive Man, and Mrs. Glick. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics for its use of parodies and cultural references. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.9, and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" marks the first appearance of Comic Book Guy, voiced by Hank Azaria. Plot While attending a comic book convention dressed as his superhero alter ego Bartman, Bart sees the first issue of Radioactive Man for $100 at Comic Book Guy's Android's Dungeon. Since he does not have enough money to buy it, he decides to get a job. Bart performs back-breaking labor for Mrs. Glick, who gives him only fifty cents for all of his hard work. When Bart sees Milhouse and Martin at the Android's Dungeon, he persuades them to pool their money and buy the comic book. Since none of them is willing to let the comic book out of his sight, they spend the night together in Bart's tree house. They get progressively more paranoid and Bart grows convinced Martin and Milhouse are conspiring against him as a thunderstorm approaches. When Martin gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, Bart thinks he plans to steal the comic and ties him up. Milhouse tries to alert Marge that Bart has gone crazy, but Bart thinks he is making a move for the comic and tackles him. Milhouse falls over the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic, Bart is forced to decide between grabbing it and rescuing Milhouse. After Bart pulls Milhouse to safety, the comic blows out the door and onto the ground, where it is shredded by Santa's Little Helper and struck by lightning. The next morning, the three boys muse how their inability to share led to the comic's destruction. Production This episode was written by Jeff Martin (pictured) and directed by Wes Archer. The episode was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Wes Archer. Characters making their first appearances on the show are Comic Book Guy, Mrs. Glick, Radioactive Man, Fallout Boy, and Bartman. Although many suggestions state that Comic Book Guy was inspired by the show's creator Matt Groening, Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok book shop who, according to Simpsons writer George Meyer, often \\"[sat] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce\\". Matt Groening noted: \\"I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and said, 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'\\" Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name \\"F\\" and lived in the room next door at his college.Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. According to Simpsons writer Mike Reiss, the writers \\"settled\\" on naming his store \\"The Android's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop\\" after a late-night writing session, figuring they wouldn't see it after this episode. Mrs. Glick was based on an old lady Martin and his brother used to do chores for when they were kids. Martin said they got to \\"pull weeds until [their] hands would bleed\\", and yet they were paid only two quarters for several hours of work. American actress Cloris Leachman provided the voice of Mrs. Glick in the episode. The episode features a parody of The Wonder Years, in which Bart stares into the distance after realizing he has to get his first job, and an older version of Bart's voice is heard saying \\"I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away forever.\\" Daniel Stern guest starred as the voice of the adult Bart, just like he did for the adult voice of the character Kevin in the television show The Wonder Years (he had also featured with Yeardley Smith in the movie City Slickers around the time this episode was produced). Reiss stated Stern was a \\"pleasure\\" to work with and it took him only a few minutes to record his lines. Stern's younger brother David M. Stern worked as a writer on both The Simpsons and The Wonder Years, so he helped the writers get the idioms and the wording of the parody right. When a rerun of this episode aired in 1992, a brief tribute to The Cosby Show aired following the end credits. The Cosby Show ended on April 30, 1992, and the tribute featured Bart and Homer discussing the quality of the show, and its importance to Bill Cosby. Cultural references Homer makes a reference to the Italian painter Michelangelo. At the beginning of the episode, Lisa reveals that she collects Casper the Friendly Ghost and Richie Rich comics, and Homer makes reference to Wonder Woman. Radioactive Man's origin is nearly identical to the Marvel Comics character The Incredible Hulk, as they each had gained superpowers from absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation during an experiment. The warning from the convention MC not to ask questions about the death of Radioactive Man's actor Dirk Richter is a reference to the mysterious death of Superman's actor George Reeves, although the addition of bordello could also be a reference to the unsolved 1978 murder of Bob Crane. When Bart asks Homer for money to buy the comic book, Homer replies: \\"One hundred bucks? For a comic book?! Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?\\" This is a reference to the Italian painter and sculptor Michelangelo, whose name Homer cannot pronounce. Bart's inner monologue in the diner scene is a parody of the narration in the coming- of-age comedy-drama series The Wonder Years and was voiced by Wonder Years actor Daniel Stern. Milhouse initially goes into the comic store to buy a 1973 Topps card of the former Boston Red Sox player, Carl Yastrzemski, \\"when he had the big sideburns\\". When the boys first unwrap the comic book, Martin describes it as \\"[T]he stuff dreams are made of\\", which is how Bogart's character describes the Maltese Falcon at the end of the movie, The Maltese Falcon. The Radioactive Man commercial for Laramie cigarettes is a takeoff on The Flintstones characters' starring in Winston commercials in the 1960s. When Bart begs Mrs. Glick not to apply iodine to his wounded arm, she grabs his arm and the scene shifts to their silhouettes as Bart screams, mirroring a scene in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind. The accusation and suspicion that grows between the boys is similar to the plot of the film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. When Martin makes a squealing noise while falling in the treehouse, Bart calls him \\"Piggy\\" and threatens to stuff an apple into his mouth, resembling a similar quote from the book Lord of the Flies (1954), by William Golding. Bart trying to save Milhouse from falling from the treehouse is a reference to a scene in the film from Alfred Hitchcock from 1942, Saboteur. The title of the episode is a reference to the 1987 comedy film Three Men and a Baby in which three men have to take delicate care of a baby. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" finished twenty-third in the ratings for the week of May 6‚Äì12, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 12.9, equivalent to twelve million viewing households. The episode was the highest- rated show on Fox that week. It was the first time The Simpsons beat The Cosby Show in the ratings. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson lauded it for its use of new characters, commenting that \\"of all season two's Bart- focused episodes, only 'Bart the Daredevil' offers competition with 'Comic' as the best of the bunch. It's a tough call, but I'll take 'Comic' in a squeaker. The show melds the series' deft satirical tone with exceptional character development. Bart seems to grow especially strongly, and his psychological meltdown in the third act is hilarious.\\" \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" was named the best episode of the season by IGN. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, commented that unless you have a \\"passing understanding of comic books and their buyers' behaviour, some of the jokes will pass you by\\". Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, criticized the episode for not being inspired enough, and added that the Wonder Years parody \\"seems pointless\\". \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" is Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend's favorite episode of the season. Wilson praised the episode for its cultural references, calling them \\"true greatness\\". Surrey Now's Michael Roberds praised the Treasure of the Sierra Madre parody, saying it is \\"one of the more clever film parodies hidden within a typical Simpsons plot\\". Colin Kennedy of Empire called the Treasure of the Sierra Madre parody the ninth best film parody of the show, commenting that \\"Bart turns [into] a perfect Bogart ‚Äì grizzled, paranoid and sleep-deprived. With lighting and camera angles half inched from Huston, this priceless gag is joyfully pitched over the heads of 90 percent of the audience.\\"Colin Kennedy. \\"The Ten Best Movie Gags In The Simpsons\\", Empire, September 2004, pp. 77 The episode's reference to Saboteur was named the 25th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film's Nathan Ditum.

History  = Early history = The firm has its origins in the 1840s, with Matthew Hodder's employment, aged 14, with Messrs Jackson and Walford, the official publisher for the Congregational Union. In 1861 the firm became Jackson, Walford and Hodder; but in 1868 Jackson and Walford retired, and Thomas Wilberforce Stoughton joined the firm, creating Hodder & Stoughton. Hodder & Stoughton published both religious and secular works, and its religious list contained some progressive titles. These included George Adam Smith's Isaiah for its Expositor‚Äôs Bible series, which was one of the earliest texts to identify multiple authorship in the Book of Isaiah. There was also a sympathetic Life of St Francis by Paul Sabatier, a French Protestant pastor. Matthew Hodder made frequent visits to North America, meeting with the Moody Press and making links with Scribners and Fleming H. Revell. The secular list only gradually accepted fiction, and it was still subject to \\"moral censorship\\" in the early part of the 20th century. Matthew Hodder was doubtful about the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and the company refused Michael Arlen's The Green Hat, a novel published by Collins in 1924. In 1922, Hodder and Stoughton published an edition of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which was likely very controversial at the time given the fantastical nature of the work. The 1920s brought an explosion of commercial fiction at keen prices - Hodder's \\"Yellow jackets\\" series were the precursors of the first paperbacks, and included bestsellers from John Buchan, Edgar Wallace, Dornford Yates and Sapper's Bulldog Drummond. In 1928, the company became the exclusive British hardback publisher of Leslie Charteris's adventure novel series, The Saint, publishing all 50 UK first editions of the series until 1983. In this decade they also took over ownership of the medical journal, The Lancet. Hodder & Stoughton were also the originators of the Teach Yourself line of self-instruction books, which are still published through Hodder Headline's educational division. As the company expanded at home and overseas, Hodder & Stoughton's list swelled to include the real-life adventures in Peary's North Pole and several works by Winston Churchill. During the war, Ralph Hodder Williams set up the Brockhampton Book Co. to sell off overstocks of theological works. The manager, Ernest Roker, had an interest in children's books and managed to persuade author Enid Blyton to write a series of books for them about four children and a dog. In 1942, the Famous Five series was born with Five on a Treasure Island. In 1962, Brockhampton took over the children's writer Elinor Lyon, whose novels the parent company had introduced in 1948. Hodder & Stoughton also published the Biggles books by Captain W. E. Johns, after he moved publishers from the Oxford University Press during the Second World War. Hodder & Stoughton published their first original Biggles book in 1942 with Biggles Sweeps the Desert around September/October of that year (they had previously published a reprint of Biggles Flies East in May 1942) and the Brockhampton Press published Johns' Gimlet books from 1947. From 1953, Brockhampton Press would also publish Biggles books, alternating with Hodder & Stoughton and Captain W. E. Johns remained with them until his death in 1968, with the last Hodder & Stoughton Biggles book appearing in August 1965 and the last Brockhampton Press Biggles book appearing in July 1970. Hodder & Stoughton also published some of Johns' Worrals books. Hodder & Stoughton eventually published 35 Biggles first editions and Brockhampton Press published a further 29 Biggles first editions. = Post-war years = In 1953 they published Sir John Hunt's successful The Ascent of Everest, and began their long association with thriller writer John Creasey. In the 1970s, they brought the Knight and Coronet imprints into common use. The latter is particularly memorable for David Niven's much-celebrated autobiography The Moon's a Balloon. In the 1960s the Hodder and Stoughton fiction list broadened to include many quality commercial authors, including Mary Stewart whose works included Madam, Will You Talk? and sold millions of copies worldwide. The non-fiction publishing included Anthony Sampson's era-defining The Anatomy of Britain in 1962. Another notable title in the children's sphere was the 1969 Brockhampton Press publication of Asterix the Gaul by Goscinny and Uderzo. In 1974, John le Carr√©‚Äôs Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy was published to much critical acclaim, earning him a Literary Guild Choice. The following year, previous employee John Attenborough published A Living Memory of Hodder. In 1981, the company acquired the New English Library, an imprint created by the American Times Mirror Company that published works from several genres including fantasy, science fiction and suspense and included books by James Herbert and Stephen King. In 1986, Hodder & Stoughton introduced Sceptre as a literary imprint to sit alongside mass-market imprints Coronet and NEL. Originally publishing in paperback only, early books on the Sceptre list included Thomas Keneally‚Äôs Schindler's Ark which had won the Booker Prize in 1982. Hodder & Stoughton also won the Booker Prize in 1985 with the publication of Keri Hulme‚Äôs The Bone People, originally acquired from its New Zealand office. Other notable books on the Hodder & Stoughton list in this decade include Rosamunde Pilcher‚Äôs The Shell Seekers, Elizabeth George‚Äôs A Great Deliverance and the first novel in Jean M. Auel‚Äôs prehistoric fiction series Earth‚Äôs Children¬Æ The Clan of the Cave Bear, which was an international success and the series, completed with the publication of The Land of Painted Caves in 2011, has sold more than 45 million copies worldwide. In 1993, Headline bought Hodder & Stoughton and the company became a division of Hodder Headline Ltd. In 1997 Sceptre published Charles Frazier‚Äôs Cold Mountain and the following year Hodder & Stoughton released Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs much-lauded autobiography Managing My Life. In 1999, Hodder Headline was acquired by W H Smith. Also in 1999, Hodder acquired the children's publisher Wayland Publishers from Wolters Kluwer. = 21st century = In 2002 Hodder Headline Ltd acquired John Murray and two years later Hodder Headline was bought by Hachette Livre, which already owned British publishers Orion and Octopus. When Hachette also acquired Time Warner Book Group (now Little, Brown) it became the UK‚Äôs lead publisher. The Hodder & Stoughton fiction list is now home to John Connolly, Jeffery Deaver, John Grisham, Sophie Hannah, Stephen King, Jodi Picoult, Peter Robinson and Robyn Young. The 2009 publication of David Nicholls‚Äô One Day heralded another international success. David wrote the screenplay for the 2011 film adaptation, directed by Lone Scherfig and the book has sold more than two million copies worldwide. On 7 July 2010 they released Stephen King's Under the Dome with four cover versions.Four Covers for Under the Dome's UK Paperback Release. In 2011, Jeffery Deaver continued the James Bond literary franchise with his 007 novel Carte Blanche. In 2014, Hodder acquired the independent publisher Quercus.Hodder buys Quercus  Non-fiction and imprints  The non-fiction list covers many areas including biography, memoir, sport, humour, health, cookery and lifestyle. Notable publications of recent years include James Bowen's A Street Cat named Bob\\" & its Second Book \\"the World According to Bob\\" and its Third Book in the works, Michael Parkinson‚Äôs Parky, Michael Caine‚Äôs The Elephant to Hollywood, Peter Kay's The Book That‚Äôs More Than Just a Book-Book and Lady Gaga‚Äôs first official book Gaga in 2011. Sceptre continues to add to its literary heritage, publishing authors such as Melvyn Bragg, Chris Cleave, author of The Other Hand, Jill Dawson, Siri Hustvedt, Thomas Keneally, Andrew Miller and David Mitchell. In 2010 Hodder & Stoughton launched the lifestyle imprint Saltyard and brought Coronet back into use. In 2011, Hodder and Stoughton launched the imprints Two Roads Books and Mulholland Books. Hodder Faith is the UK's leading Christian publisher, home to authors Philip Yancey, Joyce Meyer and R. T. Kendall, among others. They continue to publish the NIV Bible in its various formats and to break new ground with books like Wm. Paul Young‚Äôs The Shack (2008). = Flipback = In 2011, Hodder launched a wholly new print format for books, the flipback.

Operating excursions since 1992, it is the oldest operating steam heritage railway in Ontario and features the second oldest operating steam locomotive in Canada. Operations and rolling stock Excursions last about 50 minutes over of track from Tottenham through the scenic Beeton Creek valley to Beeton and back. Although the trains stop in Beeton, passengers cannot disembark, as there is not a station there. The railway has plans to add a Beeton station, but as is common with many heritage railways, this sort of project is highly dependent on fundraising. The railway has two ex-Canadian Pacific steam locomotives, the best known being an 1883 4-4-0 A2m #136, which was used in the 1970s CBC television series The National Dream. #136 helped build the transcontinental railroad, the Canadian Pacific, across Canada in the 1880s. The railway also owns a 1912 4-6-0 D10h, ex-CPR #1057, and two road-capable diesel locomotives, (ex-Canadian Pacific D-T-C #22 and ex-Norfolk Southern GE 70-ton diesel-electric #703). Rounding out the collection is a diesel-electric yard switcher, Ruston-Hornsby 165DE #10. The excursion train is made up of restored 1920s era coaches, previously owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National Railway, Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The railway's equipment collection also includes rolling stock not used on the excursions, including a former Ontario Northland Railway business car #200, a combination passenger/baggage coach used as a museum, two wooden cabooses, one steel wide- vision ex-CPR caboose, a ballast car, various boxcars, flat cars, and steam generator cars. Regular excursions operate from the May long weekend through to the weekend after Thanksgiving. Excursions feature the conductor's commentary on the scenery, the history of the line, and the place of the railways in Canadian history. Special events during the year include the Easter Express, Halloween Adventure and the Santa Claus Express at Christmas, which have a holiday focus. The PBS series Shining Time Station was shot here and at Union Station. Organization Volunteers The driving force behind the South Simcoe Railway is Eric Smith, who is the organization's President, Operations Manager and Chief Mechanical Officer. He oversees all aspects of the operation of the railway and its volunteer members. The excursion trains are operated by volunteers who have taken their training regarding all aspects of railway operation, and qualified as flagmen, trainmen, conductors, firemen or locomotive engineers. All volunteers with operational qualifications haven written their Canadian Rail Operating Rules examination and GOI examination, and are required to regularly re-qualify. Maintenance and restoration activities are also carried out by volunteers. This includes track, right-of- way, site and property maintenance, locomotive maintenance and repair, and coach maintenance, cleaning and repair. Operational and restoration activities are managed and supervised by volunteer foremen, department managers and the Board of Directors; in all cases, these managers and directors are also active volunteers who take on roles in the day-to-day operation of the Railway. Restoration Engine #136 was returned to service in August 2011 after extensive restoration work by the organization's volunteers.. As of 2020, the South Simcoe Railway operates excursion trains behind either diesel locomotive #703 or steam locomotive #136. Engine #1057, which had hauled excursion trains since the 2001 season, has been out of service since 2007 awaiting maintenance.

These titles are principally used in the United Kingdom and Australia. In the United States, and Canada, fare inspectors are transit police officers who audit transit passengers for proper payment of fare; in addition in some cases, regular police officers are authorized to conduct fare inspections on some systems.  United Kingdom  Revenue control inspectors and police officers at a bus stop in London Revenue inspectors and officers mostly work at railway stations checking passengers' tickets as they board and alight trains, but can also be found on bus services. Inspectors may begin an investigation if they believe a passenger is travelling without a valid ticket, such as an adult travelling on a child ticket, an out of date ticket, or if the passenger has travelled beyond the destination printed on their ticket, with the intent to avoid their correct rail or bus fare. If the revenue inspector or officer believes there was intent to avoid payment, a penalty fare may be issued, or the passenger may be reported for prosecution. Inspectors usually wear a uniform provided by their employer.. In some areas, penalty fare schemes operate with a minimum charge of ¬£20, or double the single fare to the next station stop - whichever is the greater. In other areas, the penalty is ¬£80. These penalty fare areas are clearly advertised with large yellow station posters. If the journey is to be continued, the fare for the remaining portion is also taken into account. Inspectors can caution potential fare evaders before interviewing them for the purpose of reporting the offender for possible prosecution. If found guilty, offenders can currently face a maximum of a ¬£1,000 fine or three months in prison.Section 5, Regulation of Railways Act 1889 East Midlands Railway, Merseyrail, Northern, Govia Thameslink Railway, South Western Railway, West Midland Railway, London Overground, Southeastern, c2c, Abellio Greater Anglia,TransPennine Express, Chiltern Railways and Great Western Railway are some of the train operating companies that participate in the penalty fare scheme.

They were introduced in a bid to curb fare evasion after conductors were taken away from the trams. Replacement of conductors with ticket machines as the point of sale method has also resulted in thousands of commuters evading fares on Melbourne trams. Many people view RPIs and RPOs negatively, and in the discharge of their duties, they regularly face being verbally abused and sometimes even physically assaulted. It is believed that an estimated 1,500 people are reported each week on services. In New South Wales, revenue protection on its rail network is primarily the responsibility of transit officers. Like their Victorian counterparts, these transit officers also carry out security patrols on trains and railway stations, with the power of issuing on-the-spot fines for minor offences, and even to use \\"reasonable force\\" to make arrests. Revenue protection on the NSW state government-owned Sydney Buses & Sydney Ferries is done by state transit revenue protection officers. In Queensland, Queensland Rail, G:Link and TransLink employ authorised officers and senior network officers to patrol bus, train, ferry and tram services. Revenue protection personnel in Victoria have a strict weekly quota they must meet. They operate by asking a suspect to pay a $75 penalty fare on-the-spot, or, if the suspect is not offered this option or refuses to pay on the spot, they instead request for the suspect's name, address and proof of identity to submit a report to the Department of Transport, in which case the fine can increase to $212. The former option does not allow an appeal or refund, but a suspect's contact details are not required. The latter option allows the suspect to challenge the penalty in court, request for an appeal, request for a payment plan or apply for a work and development permit.https://static.ptv.vic.gov.au/siteassets/PDFs/Ticketing/PTV_Penalty- Fare_2015.pdf If the suspect elects to request a review, the Department can either proceed with a financial penalty, withdraw and refer the matter to the court, withdraw and issue a caution to the suspect, withdraw and take no further action or reduce the fees payable. However, the on-the-spot system was abolished and replaced with a $240 penalty as of 2017. Western Australia Public Transport Authority, There are three different static officer's that operate on the Western Australia metro network and only two that train ride the system. = Powers = Railway employees in Australia generally have the same power to detain suspects as those in the United Kingdom: * They can check a commuter's ticket and/or evidence of concession, even after the passenger has left the vehicle or station * They can retain a ticket for use as evidence unless the commuter has an electronic ticket * They can request a suspect's name, address and evidence of identification (for example driver license, learner permit, proof of age, or Keypass) * They can report the suspect to the Department of Transport * They can detain any suspects who refuse to comply until the police arrives. However, this is only implemented in Victoria, and in other states, such as Sydney, it is possible to run away from a ticket inspector without ramifications, unless there is a member, or members, of the police force in the general vicinity.

It is defined as a hypersensitivity to psychological material (imagery, ideation, affect, and perception) originating in (a) the unconscious, and/or (b) the external environment (Thalbourne & Maltby, 2008). High degrees of this trait have been shown by Thalbourne to be associated with increased tendency to mystical experience, greater creativity, and greater belief in the paranormal, but Thalbourne has also found evidence that transliminality may be positively correlated with psychoticism. He has published articles on transliminality in journals on parapsychology and psychology. Measurement and correlates The original transliminality scale had 29 items. A revised version with 17 items was developed to eliminate bias associated with age and gender differences. The revised version of the transliminality scale includes items assessing magical ideation, mystical experience, absorption, hyperaesthesia, manic experience, dream interpretation, and fantasy proneness. =Dreaming= The revised scale was found to be positively correlated with seven types of dream experiences: * lucid dreams * archetypal dreams - dreams \\"carrying a sense of awe and fascination and/or encounters with strange and unusual beings\\" * fantastic nightmares - upsetting and very vivid memorable dreams, involving a range of negative emotions * prelucid dreams - where one questions whether one is dreaming but cannot decide * control dreams - control not possible in waking life is exercised in the dream * posttraumatic nightmares - a traumatic real event is relived * night terrors - awakening in terror with no recall of dream content =Personality= Transliminality is positively correlated with openness to experience and negatively correlated with tough-mindedness and self-control from the 16PF Questionnaire. Some of the item content assesses absorption and the scale is therefore correlated with the Tellegen Absorption Scale. Transliminality is conceptually similar to Ernest Hartmann's concept of \\"boundaries of the mind\\" and accordingly is correlated with the Boundary Questionnaire.

Early years  Crill attended Victoria College, Jersey between 1932 and 1943. He started work, during the German occupation of Jersey, for the law firm Crill and Benest, where his father was a partner. As a young man, he was one of the few people who successfully escaped from German-occupied Jersey during the Second World War. With two friends he retrieved the family‚Äôs dinghy from store, hiding it while it was made seaworthy. They set out at 8.15pm at the end of the first week in November 1944, choosing a place where they knew the nearest German guard was at least away (there were some 13,000 German troops garrisoning 26,000 islanders). The danger was that if they failed to get far enough out to sea, they would simply be carried round the island by the tide and spotted at daylight. Rowing out through a heavy swell till they could safely start the engine, they soon had to stop, to go to the aid of a second boat behind them. When the engine would not restart, they put up a small sail, but lost the compass in a squall an hour later. With the sea too rough to sail, they allowed the boat to drift, feeling thoroughly seasick after years ashore. Soon after dawn, the tide began to carry them away from land. Finally, they restarted the motor and landed safely at Agon-Coutainville near Coutances.Anon, 'Sir Peter Crill', The Times 3 November 2005 From France, Crill crossed to England. He later wrote of the escape 'With hindsight we achieved very little except to confirm through the memorandum of the then Bailiff, Mr A.M. Coutanche, the state of the Island as regards food and heating. Coutanche had prepared a memorandum about the problems facing the Island and had handed it to the German authorities. It contained courageously a hint that if they failed to fulfil their obligations under the Geneva Convention that might be something to be levelled against them after the war'. He read modern history at Exeter College, Oxford and in 1949 was called to the bar in Jersey.Antonia Windsor, 'Sir Peter Crill', The Guardian 27 January 2006  Politics  At the age of 26, he was elected to the States of Jersey as a Deputy for St Clement from 1951 to 1958. During this period he was President of the Legislation Committee and was responsible for introducing examinations for candidates seeking to become Jersey advocates and solicitors. In 1960, he was elected as a Senator.  Career as a Crown Officer  In 1962, Crill resigned from elected office to take up the post of HM Solicitor General. He became HM Attorney General in 1969, and led the prosecution of Edward Paisnel. He was appointed Deputy Bailiff in 1974 and then succeed Sir Frank Ereaut as Bailiff of Jersey in January 1986.'Jersey Bailiff sworn in', The Times, 9 January 1986. Among the trials he presided over in the Royal Court was that of the murders of Nicholas and Elizabeth Newell. As Bailiff of Jersey, he was ex officio a member of the Guernsey Court of Appeal. As a judge of that court in 1996, his comment that 'A conscientious mason will, if anything, bring to the office of jurat another degree of probity that will enhance not detract from that office' was reported in the national press.Chris Blackhurst, 'Masons make better jurors, say judges', The Independent, 15 October 1996, p 3. He was said to have 'enjoyed the theatricality of the part of bailiff‚Äîthe elaborate costumes, the steely gaze‚Äîand was often seen as a little grandiose and distant'.Antonia Windsor, 'Sir Peter Crill', obituary in The Guardian, 27 January 2006 A senior Jersey politician said 'He was always very dignified in office, a great traditionalist'. Another that 'A man who appeared to have a tough exterior, Sir Peter also had a great capacity to be hurt as he was on several occasions during his time as Bailiff'. = The Tomes affair = In the early 1990s, Crill faced one of the toughest challenges of his career in handling 'the Tomes affair', which ultimately led to the United Kingdom Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke removing the Deputy Bailiff Vernon Tomes from office in 1992. Sir Peter received complaints from lawyers and the Jersey Law Society about Tomes' delays in producing reserved judgments. Prior to their appointments as Crown Officers, Crill and Tomes had been partners in the same legal practice. In 1990, the then Home Secretary David Waddington gave Mr Tomes six months to clear a backlog in judgment writing and in October 1991, Kenneth Baker gave him a further three months to rectify the delays.Richard Ford, 'Ultimatum to Jersey judge is lifted', The Times 27 March 1992. In March 1992, a senior home office official gave Tomes seven days to resign, prompting a delegation of Jersey politicians to travel to the Home Office to protest and a reversal of that ultimatum.Anon, 'Home Office agrees to review judge's sacking', The Independent 3 April 1992 In May 1992, however, Tomes was finally told he would be removed from office with effect on 1 July 1992, provoking a demonstration of 1,000 people in his support.Clare Dyer, 'Dismissal of \\"slow\\" Judge angers Jersey',The Guardian 13 May 1992; Nick Cohen, 'Jersey in revolt after Clarke sacks judge', The Independent, 13 May 1992; Nick Cohen, 'Jersey to review constitutional links with UK', The Independent 14 May 1992 Tomes was reported as saying that 'Sir Peter Crill has been the sole instigator behind this. I have warned him he will have no rest while he remains in office because I am determined now to enter the States and change the constitution'.Nick Cohen, 'Jersey in revolt after Clarke sacks judge', The Independent, 13 May 1992; Nick Cohen, 'Jersey to review constitutional links with UK', The Independent 14 May 1992 Sir Peter \\"called for the people of Jersey to consider the situation calmly\\".Madeleine Bunting, 'Jersey acclaims sacked judge's pledge on constitutional reform', The Guardian 14 May 1992. In 1993, Tomes successfully stood for elected office as a Senator in the States of Jersey but failed to bring about any constitutional reforms. = Social conservatism = Sir Peter's outlook was socially conservative. While serving as Bailiff, he wrote letters in a personal capacity to The Times expressing disquiet about aspects of the changing world, including the campaign to admit women members to the Oxford and Cambridge Club in LondonPeter Crill, letter to the editor, The Times, 21 January 1995 (in which he lamented about 'the blight of political correctness has descended upon some Oxbridge senior common rooms') and proposals to give degree-awarding powers to polytechnics.Peter Crill, 'Risks in the dawn of the polyversity', The Times, 1 June 1991. As Bailiff, Sir Peter, with the assistance of an advisory panel, exercised powers to license public entertainment in the island. He refused permission for a visiting amateur theatre group to perform Howard Brenton's play Christie in LoveMarianne MacDonald, 'Jersey's censors ban Christie play', The Independent, 28 August 1993, p 3. and required changes to the staging of a production of Shakespeare's Coriolanus by the Tricycle Theatre Company to prevent an actor's naked buttocks being visible to the audience. On several occasions, however, 'he suggested that the role of chief censor should not lie with him, but should be at taken on by the elected members of the States'.  Honours  Crill was knighted in 1987 and made KBE in 1995. In 1994, the refurbished wing of the former nurses' home in Gloucester Street, St Helier was renamed 'Peter Crill House'.'A new beginning', Jersey Evening Post, 1 November 1994 In 1997, he was awarded an honorary LLD degree by the University of Buckingham.The Times, 25 April 1997, p 32.  Private life  Crill married Gail Dodd, a doctor, in 1953. They had three daughters. His pastimes included amateur dramatics, yachting and supporting Jersey's draghunt. Following his retirement in 1995, he was active in organizations promoting the culture of Jersey, including the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise and the Jersey Arts Centre. A practising Christian, from 1957 he sang in St Helier Church Chior and later Trinity Church. He was received into the Catholic Church in July 1995. His activities in latter years were curtailed by the onset of motor neurone disease. An autobiography entitled A Little Brief Authority: A MemoirCappella Archive (UK), was privately published shortly after his death, causing some controversy.

Each entry of the interrupt vector table, called an interrupt vector, is the address of an interrupt handler. While the concept is common across processor architectures, IVTs may be implemented in architecture-specific fashions. For example, a dispatch table is one method of implementing an interrupt vector table. Background Most processors have an interrupt vector table, including chips from Intel, AMD, Infineon, Microchip\\"dsPIC33F Family Reference Manual\\" section 29.1.1 Interrupt Vector Table Atmel,\\"AVR Libc User Manual\\" section: Introduction to avr-libc's interrupt handling NXP, ARM etc. Interrupt handlers =Handling methods= An interrupt vector table is used in the three most popular methods of finding the starting address of the interrupt service routine: \\"Predefined\\" The \\"predefined\\" method loads the program counter (PC) directly with the address of some entry inside the interrupt vector table. The jump table itself contains executable code. While in principle an extremely short interrupt handler could be stored entirely inside the interrupt vector table, in practice the code at each entry is a single jump instruction that jumps to the full interrupt service routine (ISR) for that interrupt.

This has usually been a blotting paper impregnated with cobalt(II) chloride base; Less toxic alternatives include other chemicals such as cobalt-free chloride base and special plastic films. Humidity indicators are an inexpensive way to indicate or quantify moisture content inside sealed packaging. They are available in many configurations and used in many applications, especially military and semiconductor. The most common humidity indicator cards change color from blue (less than indicated RH level) to pink (greater than indicated RH level). History The need for an easily read humidity indicator that could not be damaged by vibration was identified during World War II. Rear Admiral Welford C. Blinn, at that time the Commander of the USS Pope, became concerned about the poor condition of the weapons and ammunition arriving in the Pacific Theater. High humidity in the South Pacific, coupled with poor packaging methods, was causing corrosion and moisture damage. A significant amount of ordnance was arriving in an unstable, and sometimes dangerous, condition. Following the end of the war Rear Admiral Blinn was assigned to Washington, D.C., where he had the use of a research lab. There he developed the concept for the first color change humidity indicator, a simple Go/no go method of monitoring humidity. In the late 1940s, Relative Humidity in the range of 30-35% was the concern because this is when corrosion can begin. For 50 years, industrial and military applications for color change humidity indicators were the primary market for these products. R. Admiral Blinn founded Humidial Corporation in 1948 Acquired by S√ºd-Chemie, Inc., in 1989 to commercialize humidity indicators, later acquired by Clariant In the mid-1980s descendants of R. Admiral Blinn began working with manufactures of semiconductors to identify and resolve the problem of ‚Äúpop corning‚Äù. It was determined that the solder mounting of semiconductors, also known as devices, onto boards can cause \\"pop corning\\" of certain types of surface mount packages if they have been improperly stored or handled. This package delamination occurs as excessive moisture within the package expands as a result of the rapid thermal changes experienced during solder mount operations. As a result, an industry wide standard for packaging of semiconductors was released in 1989. This standard, EIA 583, called for the use of humidity indicator card that would indicate as low as 10%. Adherence to proper storage and handling methods immediately reduced the number of failures in the semiconductors, but over the years it became apparent that even humidity levels under 10% were detrimental to the devices. Once again, the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC), now the standards body for semiconductor packaging, went to the descendants of R. Admiral Blinn to determine the feasibility of making a 5% color change humidity indicator. In April 1999, J-STD-033 was released with a 5, 10, 15% color change indicator card specified. Humidity indicator cards are also present on many small electronic devices, ranging from cellular phones to laptop computers, for the purpose of alerting the manufacturer that the device has been exposed to high levels of moisture. In many cases this voids or changes the terms of warranty coverage for the device. Motorola Limited Warranty The previous United States Military Specification Mil-I-8835A was the governing specification for a humidity indicator card. The humidity indicator card is also specified for use in J-STD-033, which is the standard for handling, packing, shipping and use of moisture/reflow sensitive surface-mount devices. This is a joint standard developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council and IPC and is used in semiconductor packaging. Cobalt-free humidity indicator cards Cobalt Free Humidity Indicator Card Several cobalt-free systems have been developed. Cobalt-free brown to azure (copper(II) chloride base) HICs can be found on the market. In 1998, the European Community (EC) issued a directive which classifies items containing cobalt(II) chloride of 0.01 to 1% w/w as T (Toxic), with the corresponding R phrase of R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled). As a consequence, new cobalt-free humidity indicator cards have been developed by some companies. Although the EC issued this directive, it did not ban humidity indicators that contain cobalt(II) chloride. The only effect the EC directive has on a humidity indicator card that contains cobalt(II) chloride is setting labeling requirement thresholds. There are two ways to consider the EC directive: # The cobalt based HIC producers says that if a humidity indicator is considered an article in the EC definition and therefore has no labeling requirements if the content of cobalt(II) chloride by weight is <0.25%. The T (toxic) and R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled) is not applicable because a humidity indicator cannot be inhaled. # On the other hand, if you consider HIC as a chemical (indicating spot) on a paper card (indicator) the consequence is that it should be considered as a preparation, the concentration limit changes to 0.01% weight of cobalt(II) chloride, and it should be labeled as T (toxic) and R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled). Moreover, it is clear that the HIC can not be inhaled, but the regulation is about the content of substances and is a warning for users: e.g. if they know that there are harmful substances in the HIC, they will not dispose of them by burning. HICs in semiconductor packaging For semiconductor packaging, HICs are packed inside a moisture-sensitive bag, along with the desiccant, to aid in determining the level of moisture to which the moisture-sensitive devices have been subjected. Moisture sensitivity levels are indicated with a number as in the MSL list. JEDEC is the leading developer of standards for the solid- state industry and sets the standards for semiconductor packaging. The latest JEDEC standard, the Joint Industry Standard for the ‚ÄúHandling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices‚Äù J-STD-033B, sets forth the use and testing of humidity indicator cards in the dry packaging of semiconductors. HICs are used to ensure that the humidity within dry packed barrier bags remains at safe levels for surface mount devices. In the past, HICs for the semiconductor industry have indicated relative humidity (RH) levels of 5, 10 and 15 percent. However, JEDEC and IPC released JSTD-033B in 2005, which requires the use of an HIC that indicates RH levels of 5, 10 and 60 percent. The standard includes the use and testing of humidity indicator (HI) cards in the dry packaging of semiconductors. The methods outlined in the standard are prescribed by JEDEC and IPC to avoid damage‚Äîlike cracks and delamination‚Äîfrom moisture absorption and exposure to solder reflow temperatures that can result in yield and reliability degradation. The stipulations of J-STD-003B state: # HICs must adhere to a standard, minimal color-change quality level to ensure accuracy and readability between dry and humid states: The Color Meter Test Method quantitatively determines the accuracy of color-change HICs. The levels, as outlined in the J-STD-033B revision, require a ‚Äúsignificant, perceptible change in color‚Äù between noted humidity levels. Manufacturers are required to test their cards for accuracy using a colorimeter device and be required to provide a test report to the customer certifying that the HIC meets quality requirements. # HICs must indicate humidity levels for MSL 2 Parts, in addition to MSL 2a to 5a: Whereas previous cards used a 5-, 10- and 15-percent relative-humidity spot system to indicate humidity exposure levels for moisture-sensitive components, the new HIC will now feature spots indicating 5, 10 and 60 percent. The change means that cards will now indicate humidity exposure for Level 2 MSL devices. Additionally, a positive reading on the 60-percent spot indicates that cards should not be re-used, as the high levels of humidity to which the card has been exposed will jeopardize the accuracy of low (5% RH) readings. The 5-, 10-, 60-percent cards are complaint with European Community Council Directive 67/548/EEC as long as they do not contain more than the applicable amount of cobalt chloride. The full standard can be downloaded from JEDEC. Maximum Irreversible Humidity Indicator Cards Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards are specially designed cards that monitor relative humidity levels in cargo applications. Each level of humidity is represented by a blue crystal that dissolves to create a large blue spot that clearly indicates the highest relative humidity level that has been reached. Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards are irreversible, thus indicating the highest level of humidity experienced by cargo during its voyage, regardless of current (potentially lower) humidity levels. Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards provide a clear, unmistakable means of determining if goods have been exposed to damaging humidity levels during their journey. If the card indicates high levels of humidity, users know to check their products for possible damage or modify their packaging regimen accordingly. Several technologies are available.

The Federation works closely with Sport Singapore, on various fronts and adheres to the various rules and regulations required by Sport Singapore for NSAs. SingaporeSailing stewards the sailing industry in the country in partnership with various clubs and affiliates around the island state and works closely with the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) on the high performance front. The Federation is currently headed by Dr. Lincoln Chee and it is headquartered at the National Sailing Centre in East Coast Park. History The Singapore Yacht Club was formed in 1826 with William Montgomerie as its head.\\"William Montgomerie arrives in Singapore\\", HistorySG, Singapore Government, retrieved 25 November 2018. =Starting out= The history of sailing in Singapore dates back all the way to 1956 when members of the Republic of Singapore Yacht Club competed in the Melbourne Olympics. Singapore was still a British crown colony then, but it already had a nascent self-Government with a partially elected Legislative Assembly. Singapore citizenship did not exist but there were many British nationals and subjects who had residential and other rights in the colonies. These British citizens and subjects in Singapore could represent the colony in international sporting events. The late Jack Snowden (1923 - 2000) was one of Singapore's first five Olympic sailors. He also competed in the Melbourne Olympic Games in 1956. In 1965, Snowden founded the Singapore Yachting Association (now known as the Singapore Sailing Federation) and he served as the organisation's first President. The success of sailing at the major Games over the years prompted the Government to reward the sailing fraternity with its own training premise and ground by building the National Sailing Centre (NSC) in East Coast Park. NSC was slated to be established as a base for Singaporeans to enjoy sailing as well as to nurture existing sailors to become international champions. The ground breaking ceremony of the NSC in 1997 was officiated by Ng Ser Miang, then Chairman of the Singapore Sports Council. NSC was officially opened by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1999. In 2000, the Singapore Yachting Association adopted the name of Singapore Sailing Federation, also known as SingaporeSailing. This marked the beginning of the corporatising and professionalising of the sport of sailing in Singapore. =Formalised sailing in schools= The National Optimist Sailing Scheme (NOSS), set up in 1987, actively roped in primary schools in the East Coast and Marine Parade area and devised structured sailing programmes for students with sailing as their Extra-Curricular Activity (ECA). In 1999, the rapidly growing Singapore Optimist Fleet formed a National Optimist Sailing Squad comprising 20 sailors and two coaches. This squad was to be reviewed every six months. In mid-2005 the 420 pair of Teo Wee Chin and Terence Koh won the ISAF Youth Sailing World Championships, the first Asian team to get the gold medal in the championships since its inception 35 years before. = The Constitution = In accordance with the Constitution, the Finance Committee, Audit Committee, and Regatta Committee have also been actively involved with the various initiatives under their charge. Additionally, the Board of Trustees for the Sailors‚Äô Fund has been serving as an enhancement in Corporate Governance.  Organisation  In September 2010, Federation revealed a strategic blueprint called The Next Leg. It seeks to steer the development of sailing in the next decade via 10 Strategic Thrusts. These thrusts guide the Federation's efforts as it continues to forge ahead.

It allows firmware updates to be delivered to the on-chip memory of microcontrollers and related processors without requiring specialist programming circuitry on the circuit board, and simplifies design work.Designing Embedded Hardware, 2nd Edition by John Catsoulis There are several mutually-incompatible in-system programming protocols for programming microcontroller devices, including PIC microcontrollers, AVRs, and the Parallax Propeller. ICSP has been primarily implemented by Microchip Technology for programming PIC and dsPIC devices. The primary advantage of this feature is that it allows manufacturers of electronic devices to integrate programming and testing into a single production phase, and save money, rather than requiring a separate programming stage prior to assembling the system. This may allow manufacturers to program the chips in their own system's production line instead of buying preprogrammed chips from a manufacturer or distributor, making it feasible to apply code or design changes in the middle of a production run. Microcontrollers are typically soldered directly to a printed circuit board and usually do not have the circuitry or space for a large external programming cable to another computer. Typically, chips supporting ISP have internal circuitry to generate any necessary programming voltage from the system's normal supply voltage, and communicate with the programmer via a serial protocol. Most programmable logic devices use a variant of the JTAG protocol for ISP, in order to facilitate easier integration with automated testing procedures. Other devices usually use proprietary protocols or protocols defined by older standards. In systems complex enough to require moderately large glue logic, designers may implement a JTAG-controlled programming subsystem for non-JTAG devices such as flash memory and microcontrollers, allowing the entire programming and test procedure to be accomplished under the control of a single protocol.  History  Starting from the early ‚Äò90s we witnessed an important technological evolution in the architecture of the microcontrollers. At first, they were realized in two possible solutions: with OTP (One Time Programmable) or with EPROM memories. In these technologies, memory-erasing process requires the chip to be exposed to ultraviolet light through a specific window above the package. In 1993 Microchip Technology introduced the first microcontroller with EEPROM memory: the PIC16C84. EEPROM memories can be electrically erased. This feature allowed to lower the realization costs by removing the erasing window above the package and initiate In-System Programming technology. With ISP flashing process can be performed directly on the board at the end of the production process. This evolution gave the possibility to unify the programming and functional test phase and in production environments and to start the preliminary production of the boards even if the firmware development has not yet been completed. This way it was possible to correct bugs or to make changes at a later time. In the same year, Atmel developed the first microcontroller with Flash memory, easier and faster to program and with much longer life cycle compared to EEPROM memories. Microcontrollers that support ISP are usually provided with pins used by the serial communication peripheral to interface with the programmer, a Flash/EEPROM memory and the circuitry used to supply the voltage necessary to program the microcontroller. The communication peripheral is in turn connected to a programming peripheral which provides commands to operate on the Flash or EEPROM memory. When designing electronic boards for ISP programming it‚Äôs necessary to take into account some guidelines to have a programming phase as reliable as possible. Some microcontrollers with a low number of pins share the programming lines with the I/O lines. This could be a problem if the necessary precautions are not taken into account in the design of the board; the device can suffer the damage of the I/O components during the programming. Moreover, it‚Äôs important to connect the ISP lines to high impedance circuitry both to avoid a damage of the components by the programmer and because the microcontroller often cannot supply enough current to pilot the line. Many microcontrollers need a dedicated RESET line to enter in the Programming Mode. It is necessary to pay attention to current supplied for line driving and to check for presence of watchdogs connected to the RESET line that can generate an unwanted reset and, so, to lead a programming failure. Moreover, some microcontrollers need a higher voltage to enter in Programming Mode and, hence, it‚Äôs necessary to check that this value it‚Äôs not attenuated and that this voltage is not forwarded to others components on the board.  Industrial application  In- System Programming process takes place during the final stage of production of the product and it can be performed in two different ways based on the production volumes. In the first method, a connector is manually connected to the programmer. This solution expects the human participation to the programming process that has to connect the programmer to the electronic board with the cable. Hence, this solution is meant for low production volumes. The second method uses test points on the board. These are specific areas placed on the printed board, or PCB, that are electrically connected to some of the electronic components on the board. Test points are used to perform functional tests for components mounted on board and, since they are connected directly to some microcontroller pins, they are very effective for ISP. For medium and high production volumes using test points is the best solution since it allows to integrate the programming phase in an assembly line. In production lines, boards are placed on a bed of nails called fixture. The latter are integrated, based on the production volumes, in semiautomatic or automatic test systems called ATE ‚Äì Automatic Test Equipment. Fixtures are specifically designed for each board - or at most for few models similar to the board they were designed for ‚Äì therefore these are interchangeable in the system environment where they are integrated. The test system, once the board and the fixture are placed in position, has a mechanism to put in contact the needles of the fixture with the Test Points on the board to test. The system it‚Äôs connected to, or has directly integrated inside, an ISP programmer. This one has to program the device or devices mounted on the board: for example, a microcontroller and/or a serial memory.  Microchip ICSP  For most Microchip microcontrollers, ICSP programming is performed using two pins, clock (PGC) and data (PGD), while a high voltage (12 V) is present on the Vpp/MCLR pin. Low voltage programming (5 V or 3.3 V) dispenses with the high voltage, but reserves exclusive use of an I/O pin. However, for newer microcontrollers, specifically PIC18F6XJXX/8XJXX microcontrollers families, entering into ICSP modes is a bit different.http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39644l.pdf Entering ICSP Program/Verify mode requires the following three steps: # Voltage is briefly applied to the MCLR (master clear) pin. # A 32-bit key sequence is presented on PGD. # Voltage is reapplied to MCLR. Microchip PICkit ICSP programmer A separate piece of hardware, called a programmer is required to connect to an I/O port of a PC on one side and to the PIC on the other side. A list of the features for each major programming type are: # Parallel port - large bulky cable, most computers have only one port and it may be inconvenient to swap the programming cable with an attached printer. Most laptops newer than 2010 do not support this port. Parallel port programming is very fast. # Serial port (COM port) - At one time the most popular method. Serial ports usually lack adequate circuit programming supply voltage. Most computers and laptops newer than 2010 lack support for this port. # Socket (in or out of circuit) - the CPU must be either removed from circuit board, or a clamp must be attached to the chip-making access an issue. # USB cable - Small and light weight, has support for voltage source and most computers have extra ports available. The distance between the circuit to be programmed and the computer is limited by the length of USB cable - it must usually be less than 180 cm. This can make programming devices deep in machinery or cabinets a problem. ICSP programmers have many advantages, with size, computer port availability, and power source being major features. Due to variations in the interconnect scheme and the target circuit surrounding a micro-controller, there is no programmer that works with all possible target circuits or interconnects. Microchip provides a detailed ICSP programming guideww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/30277d.pdf ICSP programming guide, Microchip Many sites provide programming and circuit examples. PICs are programmed using five signals (a sixth pin 'aux' is provided but not used). The data is transferred using a two-wire synchronous serial scheme, three more wires provide programming and chip power. The clock signal is always controlled by the programmer. Typical programming communication = Signals and pinout = thumb Typical chip connections * Vpp - Programming mode voltage. This must be connected to the MCLR pin, or the Vpp pin of the optional ICSP port available on some large-pin-count PICs. To put the PIC into programming mode, this line must be in a specified range that varies from PIC to PIC. For 5V PICs, this is always some amount above Vdd, and can be as high as 13.5 V. The 3.3 V only PICs like the 18FJ, 24H, and 33F series use a special signature to enter programming mode and Vpp is a digital signal that is either at ground or Vdd. There is no one Vpp voltage that is within the valid Vpp range of all PICs. In fact, the minimum required Vpp level for some PICs can damage other PICs. * Vdd - This is the positive power input to the PIC. Some programmers require this to be provided by the circuit (circuit must be at least partially powered up), some programmers expect to drive this line themselves and require the circuit to be off, while others can be configured either way (like the Microchip ICD2). The Embed Inc programmers expect to drive the Vdd line themselves and require the target circuit to be off during programming. * Vss - Negative power input to the PIC and the zero volts reference for the remaining signals. Voltages of the other signals are implicitly with respect to Vss. * ICSPCLK - Clock line of the serial data interface. This line swings from GND to Vdd and is always driven by the programmer. Data is transferred on the falling edge. * ICSPDAT - Serial data line. The serial interface is bi-directional, so this line can be driven by either the programmer or the PIC depending on the current operation. In either case this line swings from GND to Vdd. A bit is transferred on the falling edge of PGC. * AUX/PGM - Newer PIC controllers use this pin to enable low voltage programming (LVP). By holding PGM high, the micro-controller will enter LVP mode. PIC micro-controllers are shipped with LVP enabled - so if you use a brand new chip you can use it in LVP mode. The only way to change the mode is by using a high voltage programmer. If you program the micro controller with no connection to this pin, the mode is left unchanged. = RJ11 pinout = An industry standard for using RJ11 sockets with an ICSP programmer is supported by Microchip. The illustration represents information provided in their data sheets. However, there is room for confusion. The PIC data sheets show an inverted socket and do not provide a pictorial view of pinouts so it is unclear what side of the socket Pin 1 is located on. The illustration provided here is untested but uses the phone industry standard pinout (the RJ11 plug/socket was original developed for wired desktop phones).

He is also fictionalised as one of the primary antagonists in Water Margin, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. Life Cai Jing was from Xianyou, Xinghua (present-day Putian, Fujian). In 1070, he participated in the imperial examination and was a jinshi (a successful candidate). He served as a civil official in Qiantang before moving on to work in the Grand Secretary's office. In 1086, Cai Jing was posted to the administrative office in Kaifeng, the capital. He supported the conservative faction in the imperial court, headed by Sima Guang, and won the praise of Sima. In 1094, Cai Jing became the Minister for Revenue. He helped Zhang Dun () revive the New Policies of reformist chancellor Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially conservative enemies, thereby probably also purging much of Shen Kuo's written work.Sivin, Nathan (1995). Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections. Brookfield, Vermont: VARIORUM, Ashgate Publishing. III, 44. During the reign of Emperor Huizong, Cai Jing was impeached and ordered to retire in Hangzhou. Cai Jing collaborated with the eunuch-general Tong Guan to win back his place in the imperial court. After rising to prominence in politics and becoming chancellor at one point, Cai Jing introduced the policy of huashigang (), for officials to focus on offering precious gifts and tribute to the emperor. In 1102 and 1113, he introduced reforms to the taxation laws on tea and salt trading, as well as increasing human labour. Cai Jing's policies were unpopular among the common people and led to corruption in the government. Cai Jing and Tong Guan were two of the officials Emperor Huizong asked in 1115 to evaluate the proposal that the Song ally themselves with the Jurchen against the Liao. Huizong was not interested at first, and continued \\"to get mixed reports from his officials... [In 1118], Tong Guan, in a memorial that has not been preserved, proposed taking advantage of the disorder in Liao to regain Yan and Yun [two former Song territories]....Huizong wanted Cai Jing's opinion of Tong Guan's proposal and several times sent a eunuch to ask Cai Jing what he thought of it. It was not until Huizong kept Cai Jing after an audience and asked him directly, however that Cai Jing was willing to express his opinion. He told Huizong that he did not have confidence in Tong Guan.\\"Ebrey, Patricia Buckley. Emperor Huizong. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2014, p. 382 Despite other warnings, Huizong disregarded Cai Jing's concerns. \\"Not long afterwards, in 1120/6, Cai Jing retired, quite possibly because Huizong was tired of his resistance to the new alliance [between the Song and the Jurchen, who later betrayed their Song allies].\\"Ebrey, p. 385. In 1125, Imperial Academy official Chen Dong submitted a report to Emperor Huizong, denouncing six \\"traitors\\" in the imperial court, deemed responsible for the government's decline. The six were Cai Jing, Wang Fu (), Tong Guan (), Zhu Mian (), Li Yan (), and Liang Shicheng (), with Cai as the group's leader. Cai Jing was stripped of his official post and banished to Lingnan (present-day Guangdong) after Emperor Qinzong came to the throne. Song Scholar Ebrey devotes an appendix in her biography of Huizong reporting how it \\"is not uncommon to find modern historians who portray Cai Jing as a strong supporter of the alliance\\"Ebrey, p. 523 and hence a traitor. She concludes, however, that this was untrue and the result of An Yaochen's 1118 memorial directed against Tong Guan and Cai Jing. Later, \\"Huizong told the eunuch Liang Shicheng that Cai Jing was the only one who consistently had argued against the northern campaign.\\"Ebrey, p. 525 Cai Jing starved to death along the journey at Tanzhou (present-day Changsha, Hunan) \\"as merchants reportedly refused to sell him food.

Full-time learning assistants provide support in the classrooms from Pre-Kinder to 3rd grade, with additional assistants supporting Numeracy and Literacy in the 4th and 5th grade. Throughout the Primary School, lessons are based on the English National Curriculum and the International Primary Curriculum. Swimming, Physical Education and Music are integral parts of the curriculum. Theatrical productions, fairs and student assemblies, are also an important part of school life. All subjects are taught in English, with the exception of Physical Education and Spanish. The Lower Primary (ages 3‚Äì7 years) consists of the Pre-Kinder, Kinder, Preparatoria and 1st Grade classes, with class sizes varying between 25 and 28 students. The generous staffing allows children in the Lower Primary to be taught for a significant part of their day in half groups. The youngest children follow the Foundation Stage Curriculum of England within a Reggio Emilia learning philosophy. There is a clear emphasis on hands-on, multi-sensory activities based on the students' own experiences. As the students begin to develop an awareness of the world around them, they are also introduced to the concepts of reading, writing and numbers. Students also follow a separate Spanish curriculum. The Upper Primary part of the school comprises 2nd grade through to 5th grade and also provides the students with an education based on the English National Curriculum and the International Primary Curriculum. Class sizes vary between 23 and 28 students with some of the lessons taught in half classes and smaller groups. Students in Upper Primary continue to follow a cross-curricular approach to learning incorporating Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Citizenship and 'Life Skills\\" (Personal, Social and Health Education or PSHE) together with lessons on major Salvadoran environmental and historical issues, which are included in the educational programme. Students in the Upper Primary section also follow a separate Spanish curriculum, although many of the concepts which are taught in Science, Mathematics and Humanities, are also covered in Spanish. In this way, important concepts are reinforced and students learn much of the vocabulary in both languages. = Secondary school = The Secondary School is led by the Head of Secondary, the Deputy Head and a Secondary Leadership Team. The Secondary Section has over 60 members of staff including teachers and support staff and is organised into curriculum areas which are coordinated by Heads of Department. The school achieves relatively high academic standards. Grades 6 to 8: for teaching purposes, each grade is divided into five classes with approximately 20 students per class. Generally, students are taught in mixed ability groups although there is some setting in Mathematics and Science. All students study a broad and balanced core of subjects: English, Mathematics, Science, Spanish, History, Geography, Art/Technology, Music, Drama, ICT, French and Physical Education. As far as is practical, the school follows the requirements of the English National Curriculum with adaptations for local conditions and opportunities. Grades 9 and 10: students follow a 2-year course leading to the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) from the University of Cambridge. As well as studying the English Language, and Literature, Spanish Language and Literature, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology students have the option of studying History, Geography, Economics, Computer Studies, Music, Art, French or Drama. One of these is expected to be a humanities option. Grade 11 and 12: students follow the 2-year International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. In addition to studying English, Spanish, Mathematics, a Science subject (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) and a Humanities subject (Psychology, Geography, History, Economics, Business Management, Information Technology in a Global Society). Students are also able to choose a sixth subject from French, Art & Design, Film Studies, Theatre Studies, Computer Science, a second Science subject or a second Humanities subject. Three subjects are studied at Higher Level and three at Standard Level. Students undertake a Theory of Knowledge Course, write an extended essay, and undertake community service. In addition to the IGCSE and IB examinations, the school also facilitates TOEFL, PSAT and SAT examinations and offers vocational tests. All graduating Salvadoran students also sit for the national PAES examination which, together with their studies for IB, allows them to gain the Salvadoran Bachillerato (school leaving certificate). Students who are not achieving their full potential may be referred to the Learning Support Unit (LSU), staffed by qualified educational psychologists, who help the teachers and students through a diagnosis of problems and the design of individualised teaching and learning strategies. For pastoral and many extra-curricular purposes the Secondary School is \\"Tribally\\" based. There are Heads of Year in charge of their respective year group and tutor teams. There is a tutor period to deal with pastoral matters at the start of each school day. Extracurricular activities: a full programme of extra-curricular activities is offered ranging from sports to the arts. The school has a Tribal (i.e. \\"House\\") system of internal school competitions. The school also prepares students to compete within various national and international competitions under the Team Sports Programme. The school has a Prefect body (including Head students) and also an elected Student Council. There is an ‚Äòin-house'-produced school magazine. The school actively supports the local community through its many student-led charitable projects. This takes the form of fundraising efforts to actual hands-on work in local old people's and children's homes. Students gain credit for this in the International Baccalaureate's Creativity, Action and Service programme (CAS). School graduates: on average, 80 ‚Äì 90 students graduate from the ABC each academic year. Of these, 45‚Äì50% graduate with Honours, and around 90% obtain the IB Bilingual Diploma, with the remaining students obtaining individual IB subject certificates. The exact numbers vary from Class to class but following graduation generally, up to half of the students go on to study at universities within the United States or Canada, some go to the United Kingdom and other European countries, others go to other Latin American universities including Costa Rica and Mexico while the remainder enter local Salvadoran Universities.

Native to Australia, it is distributed along the west coast of Western Australia as far north as Jurien Bay, and along the south coast into South Australia. The Noongar peoples of Western Australia know the plant as wilyawa or woolya wah. Description It is found in locations exposed to coastal winds, red-eyed wattle grows as a dense, dome shaped shrub; this helps protect against salt spray, sand-blast and erosion of soil at the roots. When sheltered from the wind, it tends to grow as a small tree typically to a height of but can reach as high as . Like many other Acacia species, red-eyed wattle has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The phyllodes range from four to eight centimetres long, and from six to twelve millimetres wide. Its flower heads are bright yellow spherical clusters. Very few flower heads are produced at a time, but flowering occurs over a long period, from early spring to late summer, between September and May. This is unusual for Acacia species, which normally flower in one brief but impressive display. Both the common and species names refer to the appearance of the pods when first open in late spring: each shiny black seed is encircled by a thick orange-red stalk, resembling a bloodshot eye. Red-eyed wattle can be used to help stabilise coastal sands. It was introduced into Africa for this purpose, but it has spread rapidly and is now a serious pest in southern Africa, where it is known as rooikrans (in Afrikaans, \\"red garland\\") . The introduction of the gall-forming cecidomyiid Dasineura dielsi as a biological control has had limited success in the effective control of this weed. The green seed pods may be used as a natural soap, by crushing them and using the pods with water to wash with. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist George Don in 1832 in the work A General History of Dichlamydeous Plants. It was reclassified as Racosperma eglandulosum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley and transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. Many synonyms of the species are known including Acacia cyclopis, Acacia mirbeli and Acacia eglandulosa. It is thought to be related to Acacia redolens and is quite similar to Acacia veronica. It is about as drought tolerant as Acacia saligna but also able to tolerate sea spray. The specific epithet is taken from the large black seed which is enclosed in bright red tissue. Distribution It is found along coastal areas in the Mid West, Wheatbelt, Peel, South West, Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia from Geraldton in the north, to Augusta in the south and east to the South Australian border. It is found in limestone areas and on and around sand dunes growing in sandy soils. In South Australia it is also found to have a discontinuous distribution from the border eastwards to around Yorketown and Yorke Peninsula and on Kangaroo Island. It is often part of coastal heath or scrubland communities in sandy or loamy soils. A. cyclops has invaded similar habitat in other areas within Australia, mostly semi-arid regions of inland south-eastern South Australia where it is considered a problem. It is also found in parts of South Africa along roadsides and waterways as well as parts of California in wetland habitats and among riparian communities. In South Africa it is considered to be one of the most widespread alien invasive species, though the roots are susceptible to attack by various species of Ganoderma fungi. A. cyclops is problematic in coastal and lowland parts of the Cape Provinces. The species was introduced in the 1830s where it was used as a dune stabiliser and by 1975 it occupied around of coastal lowlands, and sandy river valleys of inland areas forming dense thickets. Uses Indigenous Australians grind the seeds into a flour to make damper, the seeds are a good source of carbohydrates, fats and protein. The seeds pods are also crushed while still green to make an insect repellent and sunscreen that is also used to treat eczema. The pods can also be used to make a soap solution. The edible gum exuded from the trunk can be used as chewing gum or to make a glue. The wood is used to make a variety of tools and the rotten wood is a good source of witchetty grubs.

Biography Fitzherbert was the sixth son of Ralph Fitzherbert of Norbury, Derbyshire, and Elizabeth Marshall. His brothers died young so he succeeded his father as Lord of the manor of Norbury, an estate granted to the family in 1125. Wood states that he was educated at Oxford, but no evidence of this exists; nor is it known at which of the inns of court he received his legal training, though he is included in a list of Gray's Inn readers.Douthwaite, Gray's Inn, p. 46. Fitzherbert was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law, 18 November 1510, and six years later he was appointed king's serjeant. In 1514 he published La Graunde Abridgement, described below. In 1522 he was made a judge of common pleas and was knighted; but his new honours did not check his literary activity and in the following year (1523) he published three works: one on law, Diversit√© de courtz et leur jurisdictions (tr. by Hughes in 1646); one on agriculture, The Boke of Husbandrie; and one of law and agriculture combined, The Boke of Surveyinge and Improvements. All three were frequently reprinted and though Sir Anthony's authorship of the Boke of Husbandrie was formerly questioned it is now regarded as established. Meanwhile, his integrity and ability caused much business to be entrusted to him. In 1524 Fitzherbert was sent on a royal commission to Ireland; Archbishop Warham appointed him by will sole arbitrator in the administration of his estate; and in 1529 when Wolsey fell, he was made a commissioner to hear chancery causes in place of the chancellor, and he subsequently signed the articles of impeachment against him. As one of the judges he unwillingly took part in the trials of the martyrs Fisher, More, and Haile, but he strongly disapproved of the king's ecclesiastical policy, particularly the suppression of the monasteries and he bound his children under oath never to accept or purchase any abbey lands. In 1534 he published La Novelle Natura Brevium, and his last works L'Office et Auctoryt√© des justices de peas (1538), the first complete treatise on the subject, and The Offices of Sheryffes, Bailliffes, Escheatours, Constables, and Coroners. Sir Anthony was twice married, first to Dorothy Willoughby who died without issue, and secondly to Matilda Cotton by whom he had a large family. His descendants have remained Catholic and still own his estate of Norbury as well as the family seat at Swynnerton.  Work  = La Graunde Abridgement, 1514 = 1577 edition of La Graunde Abridgement, 1518 Fitzherbert in 1514 published La Graunde Abridgement, a collection of cases compiled out of the Year Books. This was the first systematic attempt to provide a summary of English law. It was known as La Graunde Abridgement and has often been reprinted, both entire and in epitomes, besides forming the foundation of all subsequent abridgments. He also brought out an edition of \\"Magna charta cum diversis aliis statutis\\" (1519). It was held by Fitzherbert J, as early as 1536 (YB 27 Hy VIII Mich pl 10) that a member of the public could sue for a common or public nuisance if he could show that he had suffered particular damage over and above the ordinary damage suffered by the public at large. To the present day, causing a public nuisance has been treated as both a crime and a tort, the ingredients of each being the same.R. v Rimmington (2005) UKHL 63, per Lord Bingham Attributed in Year Book 26 Hen 8 TT, p 4 c 15 (ed 1679) to Fitzherbert J: \\"for one can create common appurtenant at this day, and one can alienate it, and sever it from the land to which it is appurtenant ...\\" The author comments, at p 273, that \\"the passage ... must be understood as applying only to common appurtenant for a certain number\\".Bettison v. Langton (2001) UKHL 24, per Lord Scott =La Novelle Natura Brevium, 1534= La Novelle Natura Brevium was a treatise on English law by Fitzherbert, described as \\"that exact work, exquisitely penned\\",Coke, Reports X, Pref. It is often cited in judgments today across the common law world, and represents an important tract on the rules of common law in the 16th century. It remained one of the classical English law books until the end of the 18th century. Fitzherbert, in his new Natura Brevium (1534) 94D, says that:\\"If a smith prick my horse with a nail, I shall have my action on the case against him, without any warranty by the smith to do it well\\"; and he supports it with an excellent reason: \\"for it is the duty of every artificer to exercise his art rightly and truly as he ought\\".Per Denning LJ, Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co [1951] 2 K.B. 164, 180 = Boke of Husbandry, 1523/34 = Title page of the 1882 reprint of edition of 1534. Fitzherbert's Boke of Husbandry, published in 1523/34, is one of the classics of English agriculture, and justly, for it is full of shrewd observation and deliberate wisdom expressed in a virile style, with agreeable leaven of piety and humour. Fitzherbert anticipated a modern poet, Henley, in one of his most happy phrases: Ryght so euery man is capitayne of his owne soule.A Virginia Farmer Roman Farm Management. New York: The Macmillan Company. p. 36 The book contains directions for draining, clearing, and enclosing a farm; and for enriching and reducing the soil to tillage. Lime, marl, and fallowing are strongly recommended. The landlords are advised to grant leases to farmers who will surround their farms, and divide them by hedges into proper enclosures; by which operation, he says, :If an acre of land be worth sixpence before it is enclosed, it will be worth eightpence when it is enclosed, by reason of the compost and dunging of the cattle. Another reason is, that it will preserve the corn without the expense of a herdsman. From the time of the appearance of this work, in 1534, Harte dates the revival of husbandry in England.John Claudius Loudon (1825) An Encyclop√¶dia of Agriculture. Part 1. History of Archiculture. p. 41 The author does not speak of husbandry only, but of other points. The other points are the breeding of horses (not a necessary part of a farmer's business), the selling of wood and timber, grafting of trees, a long discourse upon prodigality, remarks upon gaming, a discussion of \\"what is riches,\\" and a treatise upon practical religion, illustrated by Latin quotations from the fathers, and occupying no small portion of the work. This is not the work of a practical farmer, in the narrow acceptation of the term, meaning thereby one who farms to live ; but it is clearly the work of a country gentleman, rich in horses and in timber, acquainted with the extravagant mode of life often adopted by the wealthy, and at the same time given to scholarly pursuits and to learned and devout reading.Walter W. Skeat in: Introduction to The book of husbandry by Master Fitzherbert ; reprinted from the edition of 1534, and edited with an introduction, notes, and glossarial index, by Walter W. Skeat.. 1882 p. ix = The Boke of Surveying and Improvements, 1523/39 = Boke of Surveying engraving from 1523 title page While The Boke of Husbandry gave a clear and minute description of the rural practices of that period, from The Boke of Surveying and Improvements, may be learned a good deal of the economy of the feudal system in its decline. The first 1523 editions of the books are very rare. The 1523 edition of the Boke of Husbandry is remarkable for the engraving upon the title page, representing two oxen drawing a plough with drivers. The author writes from his own experience of more than forty years; and, if we except his biblical allusions, and some vestiges of the superstition of the Roman writers about the influence of the moon. Early 19th century John Claudius Loudon explained: > There is very little of his work that should be omitted, and not a great > deal of subsequent science that need be added, with regard to the culture of > corn, in a manual of husbandry adapted to the present time. It may surprise > some of the agriculturists of the present day, an eminent agricultural > writer remarks, to be told that, after the lapse of almost three centuries, > Fitzherbert's practice, in some material branches, has not been improved > upon; and that in several districts abuses still exist, which were as > clearly pointed out by him at that early period, as by any writer of the > present age. His remarks on sheep are so accurate, that one might imagine > they came from a storemaster of the present day: those on horses, cattle, > etc., are not less interesting; and there is a very good account of the > diseases of each species, and some just observations on the advantage of > mixing different kinds in the same pasture. Swine and bees conclude this > branch of the work. The book further points out the great advantages of enclosures; recommends \\"quycksettynge, dychynge, and hedgyng;\\" and gives particular directions about the settes, and the method of training a hedge, as well as concerning the planting and management of trees. We have then a short information \\"for a yonge gentylman that intendeth to thryve,\\" and a \\"prolouge for the wive's occupation,\\" in some instances. Among other things, she is to \\"make her husband and herself some clothes;\\" and \\"she may have the lockes of the shepe, either to make blankettes and coverlettes, or both.\\" This is not so much amiss; but what follows, according to Loudon (1825) will bring our learned judge into disrepute, even with our most industrious housewives: : \\"... It is a wive's occupation to wynowe all manner of cornes, to make malte, to washe and wrynge, to make heye, shere corne, and, in time of nede, to helpe her husbande to fyll the muckewayne or dounge carte, drive the ploughe, to loade heye, corne, and suche other. And to go or ride to the market, to sel butter, chese, mylke, egges, chekyns, capons, hennes, pygges, gese, and all manner of cornes.\\" The rest of the book contains some useful advice about diligence and economy; and concludes, after the manner of the age, with many pious exhortations.  Reception  Fitzherbert's treatise on English law, particularly La Novelle Natura Brevium, remained classical English law books until the end of the 18th century. His last works L'Office et Auctoryt√© des justices de peas (1538), and L'Office de Viconts Bailiffes, Escheators, Constables, Coroners, were the constantly reprinted. = Agriculture = In the late 18th century Walter Harte (1764) observed, that from the multitude of books published on the subject of cultivating the earth, one would have imagined the art to have been more studied than it really has been. Since upon the whole it continued in a sort of declining condition from the days of Virgil and Columella till the time of Constantine IV, and then lay in a kind of dormant state till about the middle of Henry VIIIth's reign, when it was rather revived than improved.Walter Harte. Essays on Husbandry. 1764. About the time Anthony Fitzherbert in England published his Natura Brevium, authors as Agostino Gallo, Camillo Tarello, Francesco Sansovino and others in Italy, published several considerable books in agriculture. These Italian writers on husbandry, made the ancients of their country their text and model, and are looked upon to be excellent in language, and no ways defective in experience and knowledge. But Fitzherbert was the first, if we except Crescenzio dell Agricoltura (whose fine performance was printed at Florence in 1478) and Pier Marino, the translator of Palladius de Re Rustica, who made his work public in the year 1528. Fitzherbert's books on agriculture soon raised a spirit of emulation in his countrymen, and many treatises of the same kind successively appeared.The complete Farmer: or, a general Dictionary of Husbandry. T. Longman, 1793 p. ARG. The two treaties on husbandry were republished in 1534 and 1539, and many times beyond, but these versions became the most known. Over time the authorship of the \\"Boke of Husbandry\\" and the \\"Boke of Surveying\\" have been questioned, whether it was Anthony Fitzherbert or his eldest brother, John Fitzherbert of Norbury, Derbyshire. In the 1882 reprint by the English Dialectic Society the editor professor Walter W. Skeat clearly argued in favour of the former.Reginald H. C.

The book was written by Timothy Zahn, and was followed in 2011 with Choices of One. Story The story is set just after Star Wars: Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope. The book's subject is, according to Zahn, \\"...three different people and groups with allegiance issues.\\" Synopsis The story was told in three parallel threads which eventually intertwined in the later part of the book. Five members of the Imperial Stormtroopers attached to the Imperial Star Destroyer Reprisal began to have doubt about their work after being made to participate in massacre of innocents on planet Teardrop. The planet had a rebel base, but evacuated just moments before the Reprisal arrived. The Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) officers in charge of the operations had the innocent people killed anyway. Back on board the Star Destroyer, the ISB Major Dreflin made a mistake of pushing the stormtrooper too far and ended up killed by his own weapon. The five stormtroopers aboard realized official channels would get them nowhere, and managed to escape on board the ship Suwantek. While on the run, their sense of honor and duty led them to seemingly unrelated incidents where they rescued local populace, and subsequently pursued a link to a pirate group named the Bloodscars operating in the Shelsha Sector. Leia was dispatched to the Shelsha Sector to meet three local representatives of the Rebellion. Luke, Han and Chewbacca went along as her escorts. They separated to pursue different leads, the men to investigate pirate attacks on the Rebel supply line, and Leia to a negotiation that the governor of Shelsha sector was going to declare independence and join the Rebellion. Mara Jade was investigating corrupt Imperial moffs, and clues from stolen valuable artworks led her to the Shelsha Sector. It was indicated in the original Thrawn Trilogy novels that Rebels (Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa) met Mara Jade for the first time during the events of that same trilogy. As such, despite being in the same place at the same time on more than one occasion, the Rebels and Mara Jade did not actually see each other. Continuity * The book includes a cameo appearance of a character based on Stacey, the heroine of the Pink Five series of fanfilms, marking the first time a fan-created Star Wars character has ever crossed into the Expanded Universe. * The first hardcover printing has the time period mislabeled as taking place during the Rise of the Empire/Prequel Trilogy period instead of the correct time period, Rebellion Era/Classic Trilogy. Sequel Choices of One is a Star Wars novel written by Zahn, released by Del Rey on July 19, 2011. The sequel to Zahn's 2007 novel Allegiance, it is set between the events of the films Star Wars: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back and features Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Mara Jade, and the villain Nuso Esva.

Government of El Salvador\\"  Education levels  *One or two years of Preschool Education (called kinder, short for kindergarten), which is not part of the State's educational system. *Nine years of Basic Education divided into three cycles of three grades each: **1st Cycle: from 1st to 3rd grades **2nd Cycle: from 4th to 6th grades **3rd Cycle: from 7th to 9th grades; which is a transition to secondary education (e.g. specialized teachers for each assignment). *Two (or an optional three years technical program) of Middle Education, called bachillerato: **Two year General Bachelor's Degree **Three year Technical Bachelor's Degree (e.g. Accounting, Secretariat, Electronics and Computer Science, etc.) *Five years (minimum) of Higher Education, consisting of university education or other tertiary education.  Current education situation and statistics  According to statistics, only 82% of children make it to 9th grade. 6% of the children in El Salvador, do not attend school at all. Children who have finished 9th grade can go to secondary school, but only 33% will. The distribution of literacy is 79% men and 73% women. El Salvador has a very high crime rate and high gang violence, 300,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 have no jobs and do not attend university to study. According to the El Salvador Constitution (1983), every child is entitled to free education at the age of 4-6 years. Since most families live from less than $ 1 a day, it is normal in El Salvador that children under the age of 7 drop out of school to support their parents by working on a coffee plantation or helping in the household, because the parents can not afford education for the children. About 1.8 million minors between the ages of 5 and 17 work. In rural areas, about 62% of all children work, to support their families.  Complications and improvement  The Minister of Education is responsible for education in El Salvador. Former President, Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n, who used to be a primary school teacher, co-supervised the Education Department from 2009 to 2012. The improvement of the Salvadoran school and university system is in need of improvement compared to other Latin American countries. The biggest problem is the elementary and middle school education. Although the government creates incentives through teaching materials, distribution of school uniforms and free meals in schools, El Salvador still remains in the rear in terms of education. Strong deficits are the condition of the different schools, the schools themselves are underfunded. Teachers‚Äô wages are too low and according to recent research, 3,000 schools in 262 communities are in need of repair. The current president announced an increase in the education budget from 3% to 6% by the end of his term in office (2019), but instead, the education budget has been cut. In the meantime, 88% of the population is dominated by reading and writing, which is a great step forward. In 1992, after the end of the civil war, only 74% of them knew how to read and write. Spanish is spoken in El Salvador and English dominates as the first foreign language. In 1992 the Minister of Education Cecilia Gallardo de Cano embarked on a reform program of basic education. In 2017, the literacy rate was 88% for adults who were 15 years old and above. The national educational system is not the only one available. Pre-university education is not free. The State provides public education for which a fee is paid if the person paying can afford it and only one payment per family is made (i.e. siblings pay only one fee). Public education is inconsistent in quality, being extremely poor in rural areas and dubiously efficient in urban areas, becoming one of the State's greatest challenges. The private schools have also made progress in El Salvador, there are also German, French, British and US schools in El Salvador, which offer a recognized high level of education. According to the World Bank, access to primary education in El Salvador has increased in recent years, as mentioned earlier, the literacy rate has also increased. Mainly the urban areas have developed. Nevertheless, a big challenge remains the early school leavers.  Impact of education on poverty  The average income in El Salvador is approximately 851$, about 40% of the population live below the poverty line. At the moment, efforts are being made to reduce unemployment by boosting economic growth. Due to poverty, many young people tend to violence, which is why they put less focus on education. El Salvador is one of the most violent countries in Latin America. Between 1980 and 1992 there was a civil war, which cost more than 75,000 lives. Since 1992, more than 50,000 people have been murdered, reflecting the level of violence that has barely declined since the Civil War. 81% of the murdered were between 18 and 39 years of age, 82% of whom were men. Another strong deficit in education is that many children are not given the opportunity to attend school. Many children have to work on sugar or coffee plantations at a young age or help in the household. As already mentioned, more than 40% of the people in El Salvador are living below the poverty line. It is common for children in poor families to start working after the age of six. As mentioned, very few students are able to obtain a university degree. For young people and adults who have achieved little or no education, it is difficult to earn a decent salary in El Salvador. The minimum salary is $ 185 and people who have no secondary education need to work for less than the minimum salary.  Higher education  The University of El Salvador (UES) is the largest (and only) public university in the country. However, classes are constantly stopped for protests. The University of El Salvador has one main campus in San Salvador and three more campuses in Santa Ana, San Miguel and San Vicente. There are also many private universities as alternatives to UES. In Dec. 2014, the government of El Salvador entered into partnership with the United States Agency for International Development, in hopes of improving institutions of higher learning within the country with updated curricula and faculty training.

It is said that once a Chief Minister of Karnataka stood in a queue to have masala dosa at this restaurant.An article on the changes in the MTR Foods division is provided by The restaurant building comprises two floors. It is recommended to reserve a table for lunch since unreserved customers have to wait in a waiting room, sometimes for up to an hour. The food served at the MTR is a regular, wholesome Karnataka Brahmin food. The decor is outdated, as more attention is paid to cleanliness and food quality than ambiance. For many years, the customers entered the restaurant through the kitchen so that they would be able to satisfy themselves about the restaurant's cleanliness before they ate there.MTR's history and its success in creating a frozen dosa is mentioned by During World War II, MTR found it difficult to make idlis since rice was in short supply. According to MTR, they experimented with semolina instead of rice and thus invented the very popular breakfast item of Rava idli. MTR also holds a record of being the first fast food restaurant in the world to serve 21,000 customers in seven hours. MTR restaurant is currently headed by Hemamalini Maiya, Vikram Maiya and Arvind Maiya (grand children of Yajnanarayana Maiya). One uniqueness of this restaurant is that silver tumblers are used to serve beverages. This restaurant was closed in the period of Indian emergency (mid 1970s) when the Food Control Act made it non-profitable to serve food items until it was reopened in 1984.A detailed article on MTR is provided by To save the jobs during the time it was closed, MTR started selling spices and roasted flour mixes. That was the beginning of its entry into the convenience and instant food business and in a sense, a turning point. MTR Foods MTR Foods was headed by Sadanand Maiya (son of Yajnanarayana Maiya) until it was sold to Orkla, a Norwegian company for $80 Million in March 2007.Sale of MTR Foods to Orkla is mentioned by It produces packaged foods in different ranges - spices, instant mixes, ready-to-eat foods, vermicelli, Beverages, ready-to- cook gravies, range of frozen products, papads, pickles, chips, snacks and ice creams.

Karimli was born in the Saatli region of southeastern Azerbaijan. After military service in the Soviet army in 1985, he studied law at the Baku State University. During his studies he established and headed the Yurd (Homeland) movement which supported democratic reforms. In November 1988, Yurd, supported by intellectuals, organized student meetings in Baku to protest the communist regime. Special units of the security services were used to suppress the demonstrations. Like other Azerbaijani nationalists, Karimov changed his name erasing the Russian ending -ov and became ∆èli K…ôrimli. In July 1989 Karimli led Yurd into the newly created Popular Front of Azerbaijan (PFA) movement. He headed a party cell at his university and participated in the creation of the movement's charter. In 1991, after receiving his diploma, he started working as a teacher in the Baku State University Law Department. At the same time, Karimli worked as a correspondent with the independent Azadlƒ±q (Freedom) newspaper. In January 1992, he was elected the deputy chairman of the PFA Supreme Council. In April 1993, the head of the PFA and the President of Azerbaijan Abulfaz Elchibey (Azerbaijan's first elected President after the breakup of the Soviet Union) appointed Karimli as Secretary of State. After the coup d'etat in the summer of 1993 which brought Heyd…ôr ∆èliyev to power, Karimli submitted his resignation. In 1995, the PFA was renamed as the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP), with Elchibey remaining as its chairman. From 1995 till 2000 Karimli was Elchibey's first assistant. In the parliamentary elections of 1995 and 2000, he was also elected as a member of parliament. In 2000, after Elchibey's death, the APFP broke up into \\"conservative\\" and \\"reformist\\" wings. Karimli became the head of the \\"reformists\\", which was mostly made up of former activists of the Yurd. Since 2003, Karimli has been calling for creation of a bloc of opposition parties. In spring 2005, under Karimli's initiative, the Freedom (Azadƒ±q) bloc of three parties was created, comprising the APFP-reformists, the Equality Party (M√ºsavat) and the Democratic party. As another attempt against opposition rights his international passport was confiscated, making Ali Karimli one of the few opposition leaders of the world without a valid international passport. Karimli is active in organizing protests that have rattled Baku since March 2011, part of a regional wave of unrest. He was interrogated for eight hours by the office of Attorney General Zakir Qaralov on 16 April in connection with the protests. In April 2016, after Kerimli criticized the Azerbaijani government over its actions during the 2016 Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani clashes, he became a subject of a series of protests (the latest one held on 12 April in front of Karimli's house), allegedly organized by the authorities. The protesters also demanded to exile him from the country. According to the human rights lawyer Intigam Aliyev, attacks against Karimli are simply diverting attention from truly important issues and testing technologies to distract people's justified anger caused by the serious consequences of wrong decisions.Danger of attacks against Ali Karimli. Meydan TV, 14 April 2016  Criticism  Razi Nurullayev, former Deputy Chairman of Azerbaijani Popular Front Party, accused Ali Karimli instructing party members to create hundreds of fake Facebook profiles and demanded from Ali Karimli to disclose the source of financial support for his son's education at Bristol University. His son Turkel Karimli is criticized in local media to have a luxurious and careless life in expensive London clubs.

His mother moved the family to Perth where he attended South Perth Primary School and Perth Modern School. He completed degrees in Arts at the University of Western Australia and (as Rhodes Scholar for 1931) at Balliol College, Oxford before joining the Economics Departments at Adelaide (from 1935) and Sydney (1940-49). In 1950 La Nauze became Foundation Professor of Economic History in the University of Melbourne, moving to the newly created Ernest Scott Chair in the Department of History in 1956. In 1966 he succeeded Sir Keith Hancock as Professor of History in the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University. On his retirement in 1977 he became the first Professor of Australian Studies at Harvard in 1978. In the Melbourne History Department he introduced courses in Later British History ‚Äì which he believed essential to an understanding of Australian History ‚Äî and fostered research in both fields.

The White Sox, by virtue of having the best record in the AL during the 2005 season, had the home-field advantage. The White Sox won the series four games to one to become the American League champions, and faced the Houston Astros in the 2005 World Series, in which the White Sox swept the Astros in four games to win their first World Series championship in 88 years; as a result of the 2005 All-Star Game played in Detroit, Michigan at Comerica Park on July 12, the White Sox had home-field advantage in the World Series. The series was notable both for a controversial call in Game 2 of the series, and the outstanding pitching and durability of Chicago's starting rotation, pitching four consecutive complete games; the of an inning Neal Cotts pitched in the first game was the only work the White Sox bullpen saw the entire series. The White Sox and Angels were victorious in the AL Division Series (ALDS), with the White Sox defeating the defending World Champion and wild card qualifier Boston Red Sox three games to none, and the Angels defeating the Eastern Division champion New York Yankees three games to two. It was the first ALCS since 2002 not to feature the Red Sox or the Yankees. Summary =Chicago White Sox vs. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= Game summaries =Game 1= Tuesday, October 11, 2005 at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, Illinois In the series opener, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim won 3‚Äì2 in their third game in as many nights and as many cities. The Angels took the lead in the second inning on a Garret Anderson leadoff home run. Next inning, Steve Finley and Adam Kennedy hit back-to-back leadoff singles and advanced one base each on Chone Figgins's sacrifice bunt. Orlando Cabrera's single and Vladimir Guerrero's groundout scored a run each. White Sox starter Jos√© Contreras allowed no more runs, going innings. In the bottom of the inning, Joe Crede's home run off of Paul Byrd put the Sox on the board. Next inning, Chicago's Carl Everett singled with one out, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on A. J. Pierzynski's single to make it a one-run game. However, neither team would score for the rest of the game. It was the first time in six tries that the Angels won a Game 1 under manager Mike Scioscia, despite having won the World Series in 2002. This turned out to be the only game the White Sox would lose in the entire postseason. =Game 2= Wednesday, October 12, 2005 at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, Illinois Then-Senator and future President of the United States Barack Obama threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Behind a complete game from Mark Buehrle and a now infamous strikeout in the bottom of the ninth, the White Sox evened the series at a game apiece. In the bottom of the first, Scott Podsednik reached second on an error, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Jermaine Dye's ground out. Jarrod Washburn and two relievers held the Sox scoreless over the next seven innings while Robb Quinlan's fifth inning home run tied the game. It remained tied until the bottom of the ninth. With two strikes, A. J. Pierzynski swung and missed at a low pitch from Angels pitcher Kelvim Escobar for strike three. Josh Paul, the Angels catcher, rolled the ball to the mound and left the infield. Pierzynski realized strike three had been called, so he ran to first base in case the umpire ruled that the catcher had not legally caught the strike-three pitch (see Uncaught third strike rule). In a controversial call, home-plate umpire Doug Eddings ruled that the ball hit the ground before going into the catcher's glove despite signalling out, so the pitch was considered uncaught and Pierzynski was safe at first. A pinch- runner, Pablo Ozuna, stole second base. Third baseman Joe Crede delivered a base hit three pitches later, scoring Ozuna for the winning run. =Game 3= Friday, October 14, 2005 at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California Chicago jumped to a 3‚àí0 lead in the first inning off of John Lackey as the series moved west to Anaheim. Scott Podsednik hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and came home on Jermaine Dye's single before Paul Konerko's two-run home run capped the scoring. Tadahito Iguchi singled to lead off the third, moved to second on a walk, and scored on Carl Everett's single. Two innings later, Iguchi doubled with one out and scored on Konerko's two-out single to put Chicago up 5‚àí0. A two-run home run by Orlando Cabrera in the sixth cut the lead to 5‚àí2, but it would not be enough as the White Sox took the series lead, two games to one, with Jon Garland pitching a complete game. =Game 4= Saturday, October 15, 2005 at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California The visitors again jumped to a 3‚àí0 lead in the first. Angel starter Ervin Santana walked Scott Podsednik and hit Tadahito Iguchi before Paul Konerko, after a disputed check swing on a 2‚Äì2 pitch, homered for the second straight game. The Angels cut it to 3‚àí1 in the second when Darin Erstad walked with one out, moved to third on Casey Kotchman's single and White Sox pitcher Freddy Garcia's throwing error to first, then scored on Bengie Molina's single. With men on first and third, Steve Finley hit a ground ball to second for an inning-ending double play, but argued that Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski had interfered with his swing. Chicago got that run back when Jermaine Dye reached on shortstop Orlando Cabrera's throwing error to first, stole second, and scored on Carl Everett's base hit. Pierzynski's home run next inning made it 5‚àí1. In the bottom of the inning, Angel Garret Anderson singled with one out and scored on Coachman's two-out double, but in the fifth, Podsednik drew a leadoff walk and after Scot Shields relieved Santana, stole second and scored on Everett's single. Esteban Yan walked Everett to lead off the eighth, allowed a subsequent double to Aaron Rowand followed by Joe Crede's two-run single to put the Sox up 8‚àí2. Garc√≠a pitched the White Sox's third straight complete game, helping put them one win from their first World Series visit since 1959. =Game 5= Sunday, October 16, 2005 at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California Still on the road, Chicago struck first in Game 5 when Aaron Rowand hit a leadoff ground-rule double in the third off of Paul Byrd, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, then scored on Joe Crede's sacrifice fly. But the Angels tied it in the third when Juan Rivera hit a leadoff double, moved to third on pitcher Jose Contreras's pickoff attempt error, and scored on Adam Kennedy's single. In the top of the fifth, Juan Uribe doubled and scored on Jermaine Dye's single, but in the bottom of the inning, Kennedy hit a leadoff single and scored on Chone Figgins's double. Figgins scored on a Garret Anderson sacrifice fly to put the Angels up 3‚àí2. Crede's leadoff home run in the seventh off of Kelvim Escobar tied the game. Next inning, Escobar walked Rowand with two outs and an error moved him to second. Francisco Rodriguez relieved Escobar and Crede greeted him with an RBI single to put the White Sox up 4‚àí3. They got two insurance runs in the ninth when Paul Konerko's double after back-to-back walks and Rowand's sacrifice fly scored a run each. Contreras delivered the fourth consecutive complete game by a White Sox pitcher, retiring the Angels in order in the ninth. Chicago captured its first American League pennant since 1959. This marked the first time in 77 years that a team threw four straight complete-game victories in the playoffs, becoming the first time it was done by four different pitchers since the Chicago Cubs did it in the 1907 World Series. Konerko was named the ALCS MVP. He finished the series batting .286, with two home runs and seven RBIs. His two home runs came in the first innings of Games 3 and 4; he became only the third player in Major League history to hit homers in the first inning of consecutive playoff games, the other two having been Dan Ford during the 1979 ALCS and Carlos Beltr√°n during the 2004 NLCS.

In the universe of the book, the fourth planet from the Sun, in the orbit occupied by Mars in our reality, is named Minerva, which is similar in size and makeup to Earth. Plot summary When the Viking 1 space probe lands on Minerva in 1976 it takes a picture of a native Minervan wielding a primitive tool, thus proving the existence of intelligent life on other worlds. The main action of the story involves separate American and Soviet missions, who both pay lip service to non-interference with Minervan society, but in the course of their research, the teams' respective political ideologies inevitably come to the fore. This leads the teams and their commanders back home to use the Minervans in a transparent analogy to Third World/Cold War proxy conflicts on Earth. One of the Americans saves the life of a female Minervan after she gives birth. Eventually Minervans get their hands on high tech items like steel hatchets, rubber rafts, and finally AK-74s, which severely disrupt their way of life. The planet Minerva Minerva has an atmosphere similar to Earth's and breathable by humans, and liquid water exists in significant quantities on the surface. The planet's mean atmospheric temperature is lower than Earth's due to the greater distance from the sun, although the greenhouse effect of its thicker atmosphere means that it is not as cold as our universe's Mars. The ancient astronomers of the novel name the bright blue/gray planet Minerva after the goddess of wisdom. Minervan biology and society Minervan animals (including the sentient Minervans) are hexameristically radially symmetrical. This means that they have six eyes spaced equally all around, see in all directions and have no \\"back\\" where somebody could sneak on them unnoticed. The different way that Minervans perceive their environment, and its major influence on their culture and way of life, is a significant plot element ‚Äì especially important in the battle scenes towards the end. Females (referred to as \\"mates\\" by the Minervans) give birth to litters that consist of one male and five females, and the \\"mates\\" always die after reproducing because of torrential bleeding from the places where the six fetuses were attached; this gives a population multiplication of 5 per generation if all females live to adolescence and reproduce. Females reach puberty while still hardly out of childhood, and typically experience sex only once in the lifetime ‚Äì leading to pregnancy and death at birth-giving. Thus, in Minervan society male dominance seems truly determined by a biological imperative ‚Äì though it takes different forms in various Minervan societies: in some females are considered expendable and traded as property, in other they are cherished and their tragic fate mourned ‚Äì but still their dependant status is taken for granted. The American women arriving on Minerva and discovering this situation consider it intolerable; a major plot element is their efforts, using the resources of Earth medical science, to find a way of saving the Minervan females and let them survive birth-giving. At the end, they do manage to save a particularly sympathetic Minervan female ‚Äì potentially opening the way for a complete upheaval in Minervan society. Technically, the Minervans can be said to be living in a neolithic society, since they use stone tools. However, though using no metals, their society is actually feudal and comparable to late Middle Ages Europe, and actually one of the Minervan societies depicted ‚Äì the one contacted by the Soviets ‚Äì shows the beginnings of mercantile capitalism (which is directly related to its being the more aggressive and predatory one). It is this nascent capitalist society which the Soviets decide to support in its effort to invade and conquer its feudal rival. This raises some eyebrows among the cosmonauts; however, as the resident ideologue explains to his bemused comrades, it is quite sound Marxist doctrine, based on Marx's theory of history: Capitalism is more progressive than Feudalism; therefore, helping it win will help prepare Minervan society to get to Socialism some centuries hence. Earth In addition to the existence of Minerva the book alludes to a variety of subtle differences between its history and ours. The fact that the fourth planet was blue rather than red as in our universe, and named for a different deity of the Classical pantheon, did not significantly change life on Earth. Galileo is mentioned as having seen Minerva in his telescope and made the first drawing of its surface; this did not, however, make his general career significantly different from in our timeline. However, fundamental differences seem to have started to develop since the mid-1970s. Following the discovery of intelligent life on Minerva, both superpowers engaged energetically on efforts to launch a manned spacecraft there. This evidently had an effect of exacerbating tensions on Earth, with American and Soviet planes engaging three times in direct aerial combat over Beirut ‚Äì presumably drawn, after the Israeli Invasion of Lebanon in 1982, into a far deeper involvement than in our history. An escalation into all-out nuclear war was avoided only with difficulty, and though things have calmed down a bit by 1989 when the plot takes place, the Cold War is still very much on, and the Soviet Union is still very much a dictatorship keeping its citizens (even cosmonauts millions of miles from home) on a short leash. Mikhail Gorbachev had led for only nine months, and barely got started on Glasnost, before dying from a stroke (though there are rumors of a secret assassination, which Soviet characters prudently avoid discussing too loudly). Allusions to other works The Georgian member of the Soviet crew, who has some frictions with his Russian crewmates due to cultural differences, is named \\"Shota Rustaveli\\" after the 12th century poet Shota Rustaveli.

The E engines were the first multi-valve engines from Toyota designed with economy, practicality and everyday use in mind (rather than performance). Like many other Toyota engines from the era, the E engine series features a cast iron block, along with an aluminium cylinder head. E engines are lighter than earlier Toyota engines, due to the hollow crankshaft, thinned casting of the cylinder block, and several other reductions in auxiliaries as well as in the engine itself. Carbureted versions include a newly designed, variable-venturi carburetor. All of these changes improved economy and emissions. The members of the E engine family, range from 1.0 L to 1.5 L. The E family supplanted the K engines in most applications. A large number of parts in the E engine series are interchangeable between each other. 1E The 1E is a carbureted 12-valve SOHC engine.

The most common problems affecting these engines are premature valve stem seal (nitrile rubber) failure, carbon buildup on the intake valves, and collapse of the oil control ring on the piston. Any of these conditions can lead to rough idling, stalling, and fouled spark plugs, and therefore need to be differentially diagnosed. The valve stem seals, at least, can be replaced with silicone or Viton-based seals which last much longer.Tercel online message board 4E The 4E is a DOHC version. Bore and stroke is . Output ranges from at 6,400 rpm to at 6,600 rpm with of torque at 3,600 rpm to of torque at 4,000 rpm. It appeared in 1989, and was discontinued after 1998. The 4E engines appeared in fuel-injected applications. ;Applications: * Toyota Starlet EP82, EP85, EP91, EP95 * Toyota Tercel * Toyota Corolla * Toyota Paseo * Toyota Cynos =First generation 4E-FE= The first generation of 4E engines found in the Starlet GI, Soleil and Corolla models were produced from 1989 until 1996. The engine found in these two models produces at 6,600 rpm and at 5,200 rpm. This engine has more in common with the 4E-FTE, sharing the same throttle body, and slightly larger fuel injectors. ;Specs: * Bore x stroke * 9.6:1 compression ratio =Second generation 4E-FE= The second generation of the 4E-FE was introduced in 1996 producing less peak power: at 5,500 rpm, but with a slight increase in peak torque at 4,400 rpm. The second generation of the 4E-FE is essentially the same engine as the first but the intake and exhaust manifolds were changed along with a slight alteration of the ECU meant to reduce exhaust emissions. ;Specs: * Bore x stroke * 9.6:1 compression ratio =Third generation 4E-FE= In 1997 the intake manifold was changed again along with the ECU and the result was for the Corolla and for the Starlet. This engine was discontinued in 1999. =4E-FTE= The first generation of the 4E-FE was the basis of the 4E-FTE in 1989, which is a turbocharged engine producing at 6,400 rpm with of torque at 4,800 rpm. The 4E-FTE is the most powerful of the E series engines ever produced. It was produced exclusively for the Toyota Starlet GT Turbo (Japan Only) and its successor, the Toyota Glanza V (Japan only). However the 4E-FTE was a very popular conversion engine by enthusiasts for many small Toyota cars such as the Corolla, Tercel, Paseo and Sera which it fit into with standard Toyota parts. The 4E-FTE differs internally from the 4E-FE with its stronger connecting rods, lower compression pistons (reduced from 9.6:1 to 8.5:1) and stronger crankshaft. The cylinder head and valve train are identical to the 4E-FE. The 4E-FTE also features a harmonic damper instead of a normal crankshaft pulley. The turbocharger fitted to the 4E-FTE was Toyota's own CT9 model, which features an internal waste gate and has two modes: low and high boost. The low boost mode is electronically controlled by a solenoid valve and the ECU and the high boost is controlled by an actuator connected to the turbocharger. The 4E-FTE also has a top-mounted, air-cooled intercooler. The 4E-FTE is mated to the Toyota C52 transmission (for the EP82 Starlet GT) and the C56 transmission (for the EP91 Glanza V). ;Specs: * Bore x stroke * 8.5:1 compression ratio 5E The 5E is a DOHC 16-valve version. Output ranges from at 5,400 rpm to at 6,400 rpm with of torque at 3,200 rpm to of torque at 4,000 rpm. It was introduced in 1990 and discontinued in 1998. All 5E engines are fuel-injected. In 1995 Toyota changed the ignition system to a distributor-less (DIS), coil-on-plug design, switched from OBD to OBD-II and began using flat topped pistons. This ignition design uses two coils. Each coil mounts on top of a spark plug, but also has a cable run to another cylinder's spark plug. This is known as a \\"wasted spark design\\". It is electrically similar to engines that have a coil pack. The spark plug fires in both directions (center-to-side, and side-to-center). Double platinum plugs are used with this engine to prevent premature side electrode wear. A much thinner head gasket is used to increase compression after the piston domes were removed, and dual electrode spark plugs were installed on California emission models. In 1996 the connecting rods changed to the same thinner ones used in the second generation 4E-FE. In 1997 a return-less fuel system was added. ;Specs: * Bore x stroke * 9.4:1 compression ratio ;Applications: * Toyota Paseo * Toyota Sera * Toyota Tercel * Toyota Raum * Toyota Corolla * Toyota Corsa * Toyota Caldina * Toyota Corolla II * Toyota Cynos * Toyota Vios =5E-FHE= Maximum power was increased to . The maximum engine speed was increased to 7,200 rpm in the first generation, and 7,900 for the second generation. It uses the harmonic damper from the 4E-FTE, more aggressive intake and exhaust cams, some versions (not the Sera) have the ACIS intake, high compression pistons, 4-2-1 exhaust headers, and stronger internals (i.e. the \\"fat\\" connecting rods found in the first generation 5E-FE).

In the fifth, Brad Ausmus hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Roy Oswalt's sacrifice bunt and scored on Craig Biggio's ground out. Albert Pujols's leadoff home run off of Oswalt in the sixth put the Cardinals on the board, but they would get nothing more. The Astros scored two insurance runs in the eighth off of Juli√°n Tav√°rez on Chris Burke's RBI single that scored Lance Berkman from third. followed by Adam Everett's RBI triple. Brad Lidge pitched two shutout innings for the save as the Astros' 4‚àí1 win tied the series at 1‚àí1 heading to Houston. =Game 3= Saturday, October 15, 2005 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas In Game 3, Cardinals' starter Matt Morris pitched three shutout innings before walking Morgan Ensberg to lead off the fourth, then Mike Lamb's home run put the Astros up 2‚àí0. In the fifth, the Astros' Roger Clemens allowed back-to-back leadoff singles to Yadier Molina and Abraham Nunez. Morris's sacrifice bunt moved them up one base each before David Eckstein's sacrifice fly put the Cardinals on the board. Clemens again allowed back-to-back leadoff singles next inning to Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds before Larry Walker's sacrifice fly tied the game. In the bottom of the inning, Lamb hit a one-out double and scored on Jason Lane's single. After Brad Ausmus singled, Brad Thompson relieved Morris and Adam Everett hit into a fielder's choice that allowed Lane to score to put the Astros up 4‚àí2. Chad Qualls pitched two hitless innings before Brad Lidge retired the first two batters in the ninth and walked John Rodriguez. Rodriguez then moved to second on defensive indifference before scoring on John Mabry's double. This is the first run Lidge allowed against the Cardinals since May 29, 2003, but held on for the save to give the Astros a 2‚Äì1 series lead. It was Clemens' 12th career postseason win, fifth in League Championship Series games. =Game 4= Sunday, October 16, 2005 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas Brandon Backe provided a strong outing, and the Astro bullpen continued its strong performance. The Cardinals struck first in the fourth when David Eckstein drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on Jim Edmonds's double, and scored on Albert Pujols's sacrifice fly, but the Astros tied in the bottom of the inning on Jason Lane's home run off of Jeff Suppan. The Astros loaded the bases in the seventh off of Jason Marquis on two walks and an error when Morgan Ensberg's sacrifice fly put them up 2‚àí1. Tony La Russa and Jim Edmonds were both ejected for arguing balls and strikes on separate instances‚ÄîLaRussa in the bottom of the seventh, Edmonds in the top of the eighth, at a key moment. Edmonds's ejection came with a 3‚Äì2 count, two outs, and a runner on base. Edmonds was replaced by pinch hitter John Rodr√≠guez, who flied out to deep center field to end the scoring threat. The Cardinals once again had an opportunity to tie the game or take the lead in the ninth inning against closer Brad Lidge. Albert Pujols and Larry Walker led off the inning with back-to-back singles, putting runners at first and third base with no outs. Reggie Sanders grounded to third; Pujols went home on contact and was thrown out at the plate. Larry Walker advanced to third when the Astros failed to call timeout after the play at the plate. John Mabry ended the threat by grounding into a double play. La Russa's ejection marked the first time a manager was ejected from a postseason game since 1998, when Mike Hargrove was thrown out of a game between his Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees. Houston was one game away from the franchise's first visit to the World Series after a 2‚Äì1 Game 4 win. =Game 5= Monday, October 17, 2005 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas The Astros struck first in Game 5 on Craig Biggio's RBI single in the second off of starter Chris Carpenter, but the Cardinals loaded the bases on two hits and a walk off of Andy Pettitte when Mark Grudzielanek's two-run single put them up 2‚Äì1. Lance Berkman gave excited Astros fans a 4‚Äì2 lead with one swing on a pitch from Carpenter in the bottom of the seventh inning. The Astros were one strike away from claiming their first NL Pennant and trip to the Fall Classic before David Eckstein singled with no one on base, Jim Edmonds walked, and Albert Pujols hit a dramatic, towering three-run home run off Astros closer Brad Lidge that bounced off the side of the closed Minute Maid Park roof before landing on the railroad tracks in left field, stunning the crowd into silence. The home run gave the Cardinals a 5‚Äì4 lead in the top of the ninth inning. Jason Isringhausen retired the Astros in order in the bottom of the inning. The Cardinals guaranteed that another game would be played at historic Busch Stadium (II). The win also broke the Cardinals' seven-game losing streak in road NLCS games. The Astros' series lead was trimmed to 3-2. =Game 6= Wednesday, October 19, 2005 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The Astros shook off the effects of their Game 5 loss, and rolled to win their first National League pennant in 44 seasons of existence with a decisive 5‚Äì1 win over the Cardinals. The Astros scored a run in the third when the Cardinals' Mark Mulder threw a wild pitch to Craig Biggio with runners on second and third, then Biggio's RBI single scored another. Jason Lane's home run in the fourth put them up 3‚àí0. Roy Oswalt pitched seven strong innings, allowing only a sacrifice fly to John Rodriguez in the fifth. The Astros scored one run in the sixth on Adam Everett's sacrifice bunt off of Jason Marquis and another in the seventh on Morgan Ensberg's RBI single off of Juli√°n Tav√°rez. This was the final game at Busch Stadium (II). This would also be the Astros' last postseason win as a member of the NL, as they would get swept in the World Series, move to the AL in 2013, and would not win another postseason game until the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. Roy Oswalt was named the series MVP. In two starts, he went 2‚Äì0 with a 1.29 ERA in 14 innings.

Boundaries and Formation Blackbird Hundred is that portion of New Castle County that lies south of Blackbird Creek and Cypress Creek, a tributary of the Chester River. Very small portions of the towns of Smyrna and Clayton, both primarily in Kent County, are the only towns or named communities in Blackbird Hundred. It was formed from Appoquinimink Hundred in 1875 and was named for Blackbird Creek that flows along its northern boundary. Development Blackbird Hundred remains mostly rural. Geography Important geographical features, in addition to Blackbird Creek, include the Delaware River, which forms its eastern boundary, the Smyrna River, formerly known as Duck Creek, which forms its southern boundary, and the North West Branch of the Smyrna River. It is entirely in the coastal plain region on the Delmarva Peninsula. Transportation Important roads include portions of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway (Delaware Route 1), the DuPont Highway (U.S. Route 13), and the Thoroughfare Neck Road (Delaware Route 9).

Details of the operations can be found by reviewing the schedules.Schedule Private Charters, School Programs and Engineer for a Day are also available.Charters History Initiated in 1970 by The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc., the first operations were in July, 1970. From 1970‚Äì1974, the train operated out of Charleswood on the now-abandoned Canadian National Cabot Subdivision. From 1975 to 1996 the train operated out of St. James, immediately west of Polo Park on a now abandoned Canadian National Railways line. In 1999 the station, now a Federal Heritage Site, was moved to its present location at Inkster Junction in Rosser.Inkster Junction The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. purchased the former Oak Point Subdivision from Canadian National Railways in 1999. Originally constructed between 1905 and 1910 by Mackenzie & Mann for the Canadian Northern Railway, it became part of the cross-Canada Canadian National Railways system in 1923. The subdivision is connected to Canadian Pacific Railway‚Äôs east-west main line and the portion of the former subdivision used by the Prairie Dog Central extends to about north of Warren. The remainder of the original line has now been abandoned. Locomotives and Rolling Stock Locomotive No. 3 is a 4-4-0 built in 1882 by D√ºbs and Company in Glasgow, Scotland, for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and later for the City of Winnipeg Hydro. From 2001 to 2009, it underwent a complete frame-off overhaul, including the manufacture of a new boiler. No. 3 is the oldest operating steam locomotive in Canada. Locomotive 4138 is a classic EMD GP9 diesel locomotive which was built in November 1958 by Electro-Motive Division of General Motors at La Grange, Illinois for the Grand Trunk Western. A GP9 model, it has . Locomotive 1685fact sheet sent by private email from a representative of the Prairie Dog Central is also an EMD GP9 diesel locomotive. It was built for the Midland Railway Company of Manitoba by General Motors at their Electromotive Division plant in London, Ontario. Completed in March 1957 with builders number A1091, it was sent directly to Winnipeg to replace Midland Railway Engine Number 1. 1685 served all of its time out of Winnipeg, and only went to the U.S. for heavy maintenance. Locally, 1685 switched in and around Winnipeg on the Midland trackage which served the fruit warehouses while they were serviced by rail. During the years that 1685 ventured beyond Winnipeg, it regularly traveled to Emerson on the daily freight until that was discontinued. At times it assisted with the former Great Northern passenger train which ran between Minneapolis and Winnipeg. As built, 1685 originally had a steam generator for that purpose. 1685 was not substantially modified over the years. Other than carrying the Burlington Northern paint scheme when BN took over the Midland, and then again when she became BNSF 1685 in 1999, the only major modification was the removal of the steam generator. According to motive power rosters, 1685 was the last GP-9 owned by BNSF. A boiler used by the Prairie Dog Central Railway Coach 103teacher handbook was built in 1908 by the Pullman Company of Chicago, Illinois for the Keweenaw Central Railway of Calumet, Michigan. Ceasing operations a few years later it was purchased by the Winnipeg Light and Power Co. in 1920. It has remained the property of that organization, its successor City of Winnipeg Hydro (now Manitoba Hydro) and is leased to The Vintage Locomotive Society for use with the Prairie Dog Central Railway. A \\"Combination Coach\\" has an area intended for baggage and the remainder is equipped with passenger seats. The baggage area is used for the train crew, and to accommodate special equipment required for operation. This coach is always located immediately behind the locomotive in the train because Canadian federal operating regulations require that there be a buffer between a steam engine/tender and passenger area. The baggage compartment area satisfies this regulation. It has been completely restored to its original condition featuring oak paneling, opaque vent windows, pot bellied stove, and lavatory. A coach of this type was often used in mixed trains along with boxcars serving the freight and transportation needs of prairie villages. Coach 103 has a maximum seating capacity of 36 passengers and has been named \\"Gordon Younger\\" in honor of a founding member of The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. Coach 104 was built in 1906 by the Crossen Coach Company of Cobourg, Ontario for the Canadian Northern Railway, it remained in service until it was sold to the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway (GWWD) in 1954. The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. purchased it from GWWD in 1970. This coach has been fully restored and features oak and mahogany panel interior, leaded windows, ‚Äúpinch gas‚Äù light fixtures suspended from the ceiling, separate men's and women's lavatories, a coal stove and a smoking compartment. Built in 1901 by the Barney and Smith Car Company of Dayton, Ohio for the Canadian Northern Railway, Coach 105 is the oldest of the Prairie Dog Central Railway‚Äôs passenger equipment. It has been fully restored and features an arched interior clerestory roof, inlaid mahogany paneling, a distinctive smoking compartment, separate men's and women's lavatories, and a pot bellied coal stove. Coach 106 was constructed in 1913 by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Angus Shops, Quebec. The Vintage Locomotive Society acquired it from the GWWD in 1969 and placed it into service in 1974. This wooden coach features mahogany paneling with oak accessories, a continuous brass rack above the seats, original stained glass in the vent windows and slider window blinds. Built in 1911 by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Angus Shops, Quebec, Coach 107 was sold to the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway (GWWD) in 1956, and became the property of the Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. in 1970 through an equipment trade with the GWWD and was placed in service in 1972. Featuring mahogany and oak paneling, suspended ‚Äúpinch gas‚Äù lamps, brass match striker plates at every seat, separate men's and women's lavatories and a pot bellied coal stove, it is always the last coach primarily because it has a full width enclosed vestibule with windows looking back on the track. This area is useful for the Conductor and Trainman when the train is being operated in reverse as it permits a vantage point for safe backward movement under their control and in communication with the Locomotive Engineer.

Early history In the mid-90s Bramwell recorded his first album with the band Luminous, produced and released by Shimmy-Disc‚Äôs maverick producer Kramer , before going solo in 2000 and forming Oddfellow‚Äôs Casino. Early releases on Leicester‚Äôs Pickled Egg Records included Yellow-Bellied Wonderland and Winter Creatures , drawing comparisons with Robert Wyatt, The Beta Band, Red House Painters and late-period Talk Talk. For the band‚Äôs third album, 2012‚Äôs The Raven‚Äôs Empire, Bramwell teamed up with producer and composer Andrew Philipps to create a record that was altogether bigger, darker and more orchestrated than what had come before. Reviews acknowledged a change in direction citing 'bubbling synths and ornate productions.' (Happening Magazine) and 'occult incantation' (Drowned in Sound) . The single, Winter in a Strange Town was picked up by BBC 6Music‚Äôs Gideon Coe, Lauren Laverne and Cerys Matthews.

In 1929, editor Louis Jaffe received the Virginian-Pilot's first Pulitzer Prize, for \\"An Unspeakable Act of Savagery\\", an editorial which condemned lynching. Jaffe mentored the paper's next editor, Lenoir Chambers, who in 1960 received the paper's second Pulitzer for his editorials on desegregation. The paper was one of the few in Virginia to publicly support the end of Jim Crow. In 1985, Thomas Turcol was awarded a Pulitzer for his coverage of corruption in Chesapeake. Reporters at The Pilot have also finished as Pulitzer finalists three times since 2007. History The Virginian-Pilot and its sister afternoon edition, the Ledger-Star (which ceased publication in 1995) were created by Samuel L. Slover as the result of several mergers of papers dating back to 1865.Hays, Jakon, and Maureen Watts, \\"Pilot Media History\\". Retrieved 2017-04-03.

He expanded the Virginian-Pilot's parent company, which soon evolved into Landmark Communications and later Landmark Media Enterprises, by acquiring other newspapers and radio and television stations and by creating The Weather Channel, now owned by a group of investors led by NBC Universal. In Norfolk, on September 1, 1923, the company founded Virginia's first radio station, WTAR. In 1950 it added Channel 4 WTAR-TV (now Channel 3 WTKR) and in 1961, it signed on 95.7 WTAR-FM (now WVKL). The paper was among the first available online as a part of the Compuserve experiment in early 1980s where the paper and 10 others around the country transmitted text versions of stories daily to Compuserve's host computers in Ohio. Frank Batten Jr. became publisher in 1991 and expanded on digitizing the paper. In 1993 The Virginian-Pilot was one of the first newspapers in the country to launch a sister website, Pilotonline.com.

Life She was born in Bucharest in 1828 as a member of the Ghica family and was the daughter of Mihai Ghica and the niece of the reigning Prince of Wallachia Grigore IV Ghica. She received a thorough education that was continued abroad ‚Äì first in Dresden, then in Vienna, then in Venice, and finally in Berlin where she gave a sample of her mastery of Ancient Greek to Alexander Von Humboldt. D'Istria returned to her home country in 1849 and married the Russian duke Alexander Koltsov-Massalski making her the duchess Helena Koltsova-Massalskaya. They lived for several years in Russia, mostly in Saint Petersburg, but Dora never cherished the Russian nationalist views of her husband or the Eastern Orthodox bigotry of the Court of the Despotic Emperor Nicholas I. As her health decayed in the Russian climate, she took her husband's advice and travelled to Central Europe. She first went to Switzerland for several years and then journeyed through Greece and Anatolia. Finally, she returned to Italy and lived in a villa in Florence, while occasionally traveling to France, Ireland and the United States. As a writer she was first noticed in 1855 while she was writing mostly in French under the name d'Istria. She published a number of works that not only showed her proficiency in Romanian, Italian, German, French, Latin, Ancient and Modern Greek, and Russian, but also her knowledge of scientific topics, her liberal views on religious and political topics, as well as a talent for presenting her points. Her general world view was cosmopolitan, but she also worked hard to bring the resources and technologies available in Western Europe to Eastern Europe, and worked towards the emancipation of her gender. She died in Florence on 17 November 1888. In culture Lithographed portrait of Dora d'Istria. Her first work was La vie monastique dans l'√âglise orientale (\\"Monastical Life in the Eastern Church\\") (Brussels 1855; 2.ed., Paris 1858), in which she called for the abolishment of monastic orders. It was followed by La Suisse allemande (\\"German Switzerland\\") (Geneva 1856, 4 vols.; German, 2. ed., Z√ºrich 1860, 3 vols.), a description of Switzerland and its people with a passage describing a climb up the M√∂nch. In the tract Les femmes en Orient (\\"Women in the Orient\\") (Z√ºrich 1859, 2 vols.) she spoke out for the emancipation of women in the Levant; in Des femmes, par une femme (\\"About Women, by a Woman\\") (2. ed., Brussels 1869, 2 vols.) she compared the situation of women in Latin Europe with that in Germany and demanded with strong words the equal treatment of men and women. Before this volume, Excursions en Roum√©lie et en Mor√©e (\\"Excursions in Rumelia and Morea\\") (Z√ºrich 1863, 2 vols.) was published, in which she tried to show that 19th-century Germany had the same civilizing task as Ancient Greece. She also published the narrative Au bord des lacs helv√©tiques (\\"Sailing the Swiss Lakes\\") (Geneva 1861), the novels Fyl√©tia e Arbenor√© pr√®j Kanekate laoshima (Livorno 1867) and Gli Albanesi in Rumenia, a history of her own family the dukes of Ghica from the 17th to the 19th century (2. ed., Florence 1873), and La po√©sie des Ottomans (2. ed., Paris 1877), as well as numerous writings on literary history, poetics, political social and religious questions, history, art and more in renowned journals including the French Revue des Deux Mondes, the Belgian Libre Recherche, and the Italian Diritto, Antologia nuova, Rivista europea and more, as well as various Swiss, Greek, Romanian, and American journals. D'Istria was also a painter. She was a member of several scholarly societies, such as the Italian academy; she was also named honorary citizen by the Greek parliament and many Italian cities.Bartolomeo Cecchetti, Bibliografia della Principessa Elena Ghika, Dora d'Istria, Venezia, 1868, p. 20 She was also a mountaineer, making an early female ascent of Mont Blanc on 1 June 1860. As noted, she wrote a description of her climb of M√∂nch in La Suisse allemande. =The Albanian cause= Her family's history and fame, as well as its putative Albanian origins, are mostly known to the Western readers from Princess Elena Ghica's memoirs Gli Albanesi in Rumenia. Storia dei principi Ghika (\\"The Albanians in Romania. The history of the Ghica Princes\\"). For Dora d'Istria (Elena Ghica's nom de plume), the crumbly theory of the Albanian origin of the family's founder, resurrected after several centuries of latent existence, proved to be very lucrative; it gave a new reason for her Romantic involvement in the Balkan people's emancipation struggle (she had previously adopted ‚Äì and later abandon ‚Äì a Hellenophile attitude courtesy of her Greek maternal ancestry and the influence of her Greek tutor Gregorios Pappadopoulos), as well as in her anti-establishment attitude generated by the entrenching of the Hohenzollern in the Romanian Principality to the detriment of her family who had high hopes for a return on the throne.Liviu Borda»ô, Dor de DunƒÉre ≈üi alte nostalgii cosmopolite ‚Äì Pre≈£ul cosmopolitismului, in Observator Cultural, No. 437, August 2008. She started learning Albanian history and in 1866 she became the main advocate in Western Europe for the Albanian cause, despite the fact that she never learned the Albanian language. Her book \\"Gli Albanesi in Rumenia\\" was preceded by a series of articles on the nationalities from South-Eastern Europe and their struggle for independence. After articles on the Romanian (1859), Greek (1860) and Serbian (1865) ethnic identities came out, Dora d'Istria published in 1866 an article entitled The Albanian nationality according to folksongs. The study was translated into Albanian in 1867 by the Italo-Albanian patriot Dhimit√´r Kamarda,Paul Cernovodeanu et al., Elena Ghica ‚Äì Dora d'Istria. Online at Ghyka.net and was prefaced by a revolutionary poem written by an Albanian author and addressed to his countrymen urging Albanians to rise up against the Ottomans.Nathalie Clayer, Origins of Albanian nationalism, Karthala, Paris, 2007, p.209, apud Paul Cernovodeanu et al., Elena Ghica ‚Äì Dora d'Istria. Online at Ghyka.net Henceforth Dora d'Istria became known in Albanians nationalist circles that used her name to gain support for their cause. This situation was mutual and nurtured her writings (most notably her correspondence), and she cultivated relationships with notable Albanian patriots such as Kamarda and Jeronim de Rada. After the publication of Gli Albanesi in Romania... the Albanian nationalists in Italy declared Elena Ghica as the uncrowned queen of Albania. These speculations were tacitly entertained by Elena Ghica; soon other members of the family were drawn into this Albanian nationalistic tradition. At the end of the century another member of her family, Romanian writer and socialite Albert Ghica, would likewise encourage vocal demands for the Albanian throne. Ghika is an Albanian name Gjika is used today in Albania.

He lived in Roanoke, Alabama. At age 69, he died of smoke inhalation when his house burned down during the early morning hours of Friday, July 29, 1989. Clark is the subject of a self- published biography, written by his only offspring, Charlotte A. Clark- Frieson, entitled Chief Cook & Bottle-Washer: The Unconquerable Soul of Wilkie Clark. Wilkie Clark In this biography, Clark-Frieson posthumously claims for her father the historical remembrance and distinction that she believes he rightfully deserves as an Alabama Champion for Civil and Human Rights. Thus, she writes him into history, through her book. As a result of the publication of the biography, on February 19, 2005, Clark posthumously received historical distinction by resolution of the Randolph County Commission, The Roanoke City Council, and the Mayor of the City of Five Points, Alabama. Clark's biography tells the story of a dirt-poor boy who grew up under the oppressive conditions of Jim Crow in the South, and emerged from raw racial oppression to become a self-made, and self-taught entrepreneur. As a young man, he accepted the position of President of the County's NAACP, a challenge very few black men of that day were willing to accept, for with it came the threat of being lynched, or ambushed by vindictive whites, who at that time, felt free to do to black civil rights workers, whatever they pleased. As NAACP president, and with limited help from other blacks Clark pressed forward, implementing every NAACP initiative he could‚Äîchallenging the racial conditions of unpaved streets, inadequate school facilities, and books, desegregation, voter registration, and after desegregation, served as a staunch advocate for the children attending schools in Randolph County, Alabama. During the 1970s he became the first black to run for a seat on the County's Board of Education, with whom he had battled for a number of years over unfair discipline at the Randolph County High School. Aided by many other black activists who later came on the scene, Clark was instrumental in facilitating the filing of litigation creating single member voting districts, making it possible for many \\"firsts\\" to be elected to public offices in Randolph County, Alabama. His own daughter, Charlotte A. Clark-Frieson was among those elected to public office, as a result of this litigation. As a means of strengthening her claim of historical distinction, Clark-Frieson has founded and established a Randolph County-based grass-roots organization named for Clark, called The Wilkie Clark Memorial Foundation, Inc. She uses her father's life and courageous community works as the philosophical pillars upon which the foundation's missions are established. Its purposes include: black economic empowerment, historical preservation of black history throughout East Alabama and West Georgia, community education, etc. As a means of promoting the missions of the Clark Memorial Foundation, Inc., the organization publishes a black weekly newspaper, The Peoples Voice. The Peoples Voice was inaugurated July 22, 2005, and has been in continuous publication since. The paper is distributed throughout the nation, with it major new focus on East Alabama and West Georgia. References *Clark-Frieson, Charlotte A.

He lived at the same time as his cousin Henry Doubleday (1808-1875) the entomologist and ornithologist. Doubleday had a wide range of interests, in 1851 he won a bronze medal for lace designs made in Coggeshall and shown at the Great Exhibition. He gained the contract with De La Rue for the supply of gum arabic for postage stamps. Gum arabic is made from imported extracts from the acacia tree: in his efforts to find a suitable material which could be grown in England he experimented with imported varieties of comfrey, though the gum produced proved to be unsuitable. The value of his work was recognised and he was elected a member of the Royal Horticultural Society, however his membership was never registered as he was unable to afford the fee. The full extent of his work may never be known, as his notes were burnt by his family after his death aged 92 in Coggeshall. The work was also recognised by Lawrence D Hills, a horticulturalist who named the Henry Doubleday Research Association after him.

The character's first appearance was in 1985 in Batman & the Outsiders #25. Looker made her first live appearance in the second season of Black Lightning played by actress Sofia Vassilieva. Publication history Looker made her first appearance in Batman & the Outsiders #25 (Sept 1985) and was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo. Fictional character biography =Emily Briggs= Emily Briggs was a mousy bank teller who lived a quiet life with her husband in Gotham City. That all changed when she was kidnapped by people from the underground civilization known as Abyssia. The Outsiders set out to rescue Emily. After a battle with the people of Abyssia, Emily's heritage was revealed to her, and as Halley's Comet passed by the Earth, she gained her super powers, which also had the effect of making her very attractive physically. =Joining the Outsiders= Outsiders #31. After leaving Abyssia to its people, Emily returned with the Outsiders and an astonished husband. She soon took on the name \\"Lia\\" as well as a more confident, yet self-centered, personality. Emily's first outing as Looker occurred after the Outsiders had been captured by the Masters of Disaster. After defeating the Masters of Disaster, she freed the Outsiders and was welcomed into their ranks.Adventures of the Outsiders #34 June 1986 Her first tenure with the Outsiders showed how much the mousy Emily Briggs had changed, as she became obsessed with her beauty, something that usually created some tension between her and Katana. The tension was only heightened with the budding friendship between Looker and Halo, where the more free- spirited Looker was in sharp contrast with Halo's stricter legal guardian, Katana. Looker shows a deep current of intelligence, when she defeats an intelligent virus inhabiting her then-friend Dr. Helga Jace. The sentient virus, believing that Looker was injecting Jace with a vaccine to which Jace was allergic, fled the body and died upon contact with the air. The vaccine was in fact, harmless glucose and Looker herself was already immune because she was not allergic. Unfortunately, Jace would later go on to willingly betray the Outsiders to the alien Manhunters. Looker's role as somewhat of an outsider amongst Outsiders continued to worsen, especially when Windfall joined, a former Master of Disaster and peer of Halo, and the two were constantly involved in a rivalry of sorts. On top of that, Looker started a short affair with the team-leader Geo-Force during a time that they were stranded on an island but which continued when they returned. Eventually though, there came a mutual decision to call it quits, it being unfair not only to Gregg (Looker's husband) but also to Denise (Geo-Force's girlfriend). Some time later, Looker received a call for help from Abyssia. Traveling to the underground city, Looker discovered that Abyssia had been taken over. Looker invoked a challenge on the despot, and in the course of the battle, she was stripped of her beauty and much of her power. Shortly afterwards, Geo- Force disbanded the Outsiders, and Lia returned to her previous life in Gotham City. Through unknown circumstances, Looker would regain her powers and be targeted by the Mud Pack, a group of various villains using the Clayface name, including a female Clayface whom Looker fought while a member of the Outsiders. Lady Clayface duplicated Looker's form and powers in order to attempt to drive Batman insane but Looker was able to undo the damage, in the process seeing into Bruce's mind and learning of his inner turmoil. She ultimately helped Batman defeat the group and parted ways again.Detective Comics #604-607 =Becoming a vampire= Outsiders (vol. 2) #1. When Geo- Force's homeland Markovia was overrun with vampires, Emily's powers returned, and Looker was back in action alongside the Outsiders. An attempt by Queen Ilona to kill Geo-Force leads to Looker running into their leader, Roderick. Instantly enamoured by her, Roderick transforms Lia into a vampire in the hopes of Lia becoming his bride. After the transformation into a vampire, Looker's existing powers were joined by some new abilities. Her metahuman physiology suppresses some of the traditional vampiric weaknesses such as vulnerability to sunlight. The Outsiders are forced to become fugitives after Roderick frames Geo-Force for the murder of Queen Ilona. Looker helps the team face many adversaries, including the new Batman, the Eradicator, Halo's alien relatives and Islamic super-terrorists. Once the vampires were defeated and the Outsiders reputation is restored, the team \\"unofficially\\" disbands. They now work solely out of Markovia, now ruled by Geo-Force. Served with divorce papers and now living under the vampiric curse, Lia has apparently broken all ties with her past life. =Retirement= Lia at some point after this may have cut her ties with her vampire coven; she also became more independent in her choice of actions. She eventually became one of the hosts of the television program The Scene, similar to The View. Her co-hosts included Vicki Vale, Tawny Young, and Linda Park. Two episodes were shown in which they interviewed Wonder Woman on her career, which were shown in that title comic. During taping, Lia would wear a scarf around her neck to hide the vampire bite wounds.Wonder Woman (Vol. 2) #170 and #188 =Infinite Crisis and World War III= Looker later shows up in the Infinite Crisis storyline.Infinite Crisis #7 She is part of the army of super-heroes gathered by Oracle to defend the city of Metropolis against the super-villain army of Alexander Luthor during the Battle of Metropolis. At the climax of the battle, the insane super- villain Superboy-Prime abandoned the fight to try to destroy the entire universe via destroying the planet Oa. Looker was one of many super-heroes with flight power who attempted to stop Superboy-Prime from leaving Earth. During the mid-air battle that ensued, Superboy-Prime destroyed the containment suit of radioactive super-hero Breach. Both Looker and fellow Outsider Technocrat were near Breach when the hero exploded. However, her telekinetic aura protected her from the explosion. Looker later reappeared during the events of \\"World War III\\", to help fight Black Adam.World War III #4 She was shown alongside Halo and Black Lightning, in the moments before the final battle with Adam. =Later Outsiders ties= Looker resurfaced at the request of Batman to help him read the mind of an informant.Batman and the Outsiders Vol. 2 #9 (July 2008) In this instance Looker is still depicted as a vampire, but it is implied she is no longer immune to sunlight or is at least weakened in its presence. While scanning the informant's mind she is shown to be able to scan his misplaced thought patterns which were shifted off planet, displaying a power range over quite some distance. Lia now lives alone in a large, elaborately decorated mansion in Gotham City filled with framed photos of herself taken during her previous modeling days. Lia reappears later where it is revealed she has been publicly moonlighting in her modeling career while secretly killing members of a powerful vampire clan. The clan retaliates by hiring a vampire hunter to assassinate her.The Outsiders (vol. 4) #29 The assassin is unsuccessful as Lia was able to destroy him before booking a flight to Markovia in order to help Geo-Force and her teammates. When she arrives in Markovia, she helps her former team fight an invading country. Looker's New 52 look. Textless cover to National Comics: Looker #1. Art by Guillem March. She later joins up with the new team of Outsiders sanctioned by Batman Incorporated, but the entire team is supposedly killed in a satellite explosion orchestrated by Talia al Ghul. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Looker is introduced once again as an agent of Batman Incorporated alongside Halo and Metamorpho. It is revealed the Outsiders had survived the explosion but were assumed dead, and now do undercover jobs for Batman.Batman Incorporated (vol. 2) #1. However, the character is portrayed in the same fashion as she was prior to the events of Flashpoint An alternate continuity version of Looker appears in National Comics: Looker. Discarding her previous origin, here Looker is introduced as an attractive supermodel who became a vampire after a one-night stand turns her. Unable to continue being a model because of her vampirism (since she can not be photographed), Emily Briggs opens her own modeling agency, LOOKER, and uses her vampire powers to protect models from the evil elements of the fashion industry. She wears a red costume as opposed to the classic costume she wears in the pages of Batman Incorporated. Powers and abilities Looker possesses the full spectrum of psionic abilities: telepathy, telekinesis, psychometry, enhanced metabolism, mind-control, psionic energy blasts, levitation, the creation of force shields, remote vision, and enhanced healing. Due to her vampiric nature, Looker can turn into vapor, but only at night. She also has the vampiric ability to mentally command vermin such as bugs. Her psionic powers suppress the vampire weakness to sunlight; however, she still requires blood as other vampires do. Changes in The New 52 continuity have left her as susceptible to sunlight as other vampires. In her earlier appearances, Looker is also a lucid dreamer.Detective Comics #604 Her original costume was manufactured from a material unique to Abyssia; \\"one way fabric\\", which was invisible from one side. This allowed her to keep her costume handy but not visible. She would turn the clothing inside out to make it visible. In other media =Television= * A villainous version of Looker appears in Black Lightning portrayed by Sofia Vassilieva. This version is a white supremacist who can control people with a silver metallic substance. Settling in the rural area of South Freeland 30 years ago, she uses her ability to control the Sange (white) population of South Freeland while reducing the Perdi (black) population to a form of slavery. The original version of Looker was mentioned as a potential cosplay idea for Anissa Pierce in the episode \\"LaWanda: The Book of Burial\\". Looker makes her debut in the second season episode of the series titled \\"The Book of Blood: Chapter Two: The Perdi\\". * A teenage version of Lia Briggs appears in Young Justice: Outsiders episode \\"Elder Wisdom\\", voiced by Grey Griffin. She is portrayed as Scottish in this version and is a resident at the Meta-Human Youth Center after being rescued from the League of Shadows by the Outsiders. =Film= Model Citizen from the 2010 film Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths A parallel-Earth version of Looker named Model Citizen appears in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, voiced by Kari W√ºhrer. She is a member of Owlman's team, which consists of alternate versions of the Outsiders and Justice League Detroit, and a part of the wider Crime Syndicate of America. Model Citizen does battle against the Justice League when they first arrive on their Earth, and uses her powers to try to manipulate Flash into joining her before ultimately being knocked out by Wonder Woman.

First owned locally, then employee-owned, it became a Copley Press entity in 1996. In 2007, the paper was sold to Fairport, New York-based GateHouse Media. History The oldest ancestor of the Journal Star, the Peoria Daily Transcript, was founded by N.C. Nason and first published on December 17, 1855. The Peoria Journal founded as an afternoon paper by Eugene F. Baldwin, the owner of the El Paso Journal and a former editor of the Daily Transcript, and J. B. Barnes, and first publisher on December 3, 1877. Henry Means Pindell started the Peoria Herald in 1889; and soon bought out the Daily Transcript, forming the Herald-Transcript. Baldwin, who had since left the Journal, started the Peoria Star, with Charles M. Powell on November 7, 1897. Pindell bought the Journal in 1900, sold the Herald-Transcript in 1902, and, after that newspaper had become the Transcript, bought it back in 1916 and merged it with the Journal, creating the Peoria Journal-Transcript, with the Transcript in the morning and the Journal in the afternoon. In 1944, the Journal and Transcript and their rival Star combined presses as Peoria Newspapers Inc. with the Star as a morning paper and the Journal-Transcript as an afternoon paper, but retained their competition in journalism until 1954, when a full merger was agreed to. Once the agreement was reached, both the morning and afternoon papers immediately changed their names to the Journal Star. To hold the merged newspaper, the current newspaper headquarters were built near War Memorial Drive (U.S. Route 150) and the McClugage Bridge; the first edition from the new presses was on November 14, 1955. During a newspaper strike in 1958, members of the Newspaper Guild printed a temporary paper, The Peoria Citizen. In the 1980 presidential election, the Journal Star endorsed Libertarian candidate Ed Clark.Doherty, Brian. Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement, pg. 414 Between 1984 and 1990, the Journal Star Employee Stock Ownership Plan bought about 83 percent of the company, making it effectively employee-owned. It company also bought the Galesburg Register-Mail of Galesburg, Illinois, in 1989. However, the success for the employees had the opposite effect for the company itself, as it had to buy back stock of large numbers of early retirees. The paper was sold to Copley Press, owned by Helen Copley, in 1996; Copley also owned the downstate Illinois papers the State Journal-Register in Springfield, Illinois and the Lincoln Courier. When Copley purchased the paper in 1996, the daily circulation was 75,000+. According to a Knight Foundation report in 2005, the Journal Star circulation is now 65,126. The Journal Star is the highest-circulation newspaper in downstate Illinois and the fourth-highest circulation Illinois newspaper.

Hundreds were once used as a basis for representation in the Delaware General Assembly, and while their names still appear on all real estate transactions, they presently have no meaningful use or purpose except as a geographical point of reference. Boundaries and formation Appoquinimink Hundred is that portion of New Castle County that lies south of Appoquinimink Creek, extended generally westward from its headwaters to the Maryland state line, and north of Blackbird Creek and Cypress Creek, a tributary of the Chester River. It was one of the original hundreds in Delaware created in 1682 and was named for Appoquinimink Creek that flows along its northern boundary. When created it included the area now in Blackbird Hundred, which was split off in 1875. Originally, the default boundary of Delaware and Maryland was the vague height of land between the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay drainage basins and Appoquinimink Hundred extended only to that point. With the running of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line in 1767, the western boundary of Delaware was established in its present location and became Appoquinimink Hundred‚Äôs western boundary. The town of Townsend and a portion of the town of Middletown are in the hundred. Development Appoquinimink Hundred remains largely rural and agricultural, but there is significant development beginning around Townsend and Middletown. Geography The important geographical features of the hundred, in addition to Appoquinimink Creek and Blackbird Creek, include the Delaware River, which forms its eastern boundary, Noxontown Pond, and the headwaters of the Sassafras River. It is entirely in the coastal plain region on the Delmarva Peninsula. Transportation Important roads include portions of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway (Delaware Route 1), the DuPont Highway (U.S. Route 13), the Townsend Road (Delaware Route 71), Augustine Beach Road and Taylor‚Äôs Bridge Road (Delaware Route 9). A portion of the old Delaware Railroad, subsequently the Delmarva branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, now the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision, runs north-south through Townsend, and Middletown, and a portion of the Maryland & Delaware Railroad's Northern Line runs west from Townsend.

It was laid down in the shallows of the Jurassic sea and is part of the more widely defined Great Oolite Group. It was previously known as the Great Oolite Limestone, White Limestone and the Snitterby Limestone Formation. It is the lateral equivalent of the White Limestone Formation From the Jurassic ridge it extends eastwards below the later deposits and in the North Sea terminology, it is part of the West Sole Group. (Cameron p. 74) Formation The Blisworth limestone lies above the Upper Estuarine Series of strata. The latter was formed close to the coast where rivers flowed from the London-Brabant Island. The land sank a little in relation to the sea so the site lay a little further offshore. In the hot, shallow sea, the water partially evaporated so that the dissolved calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was precipitated onto minute nuclei to form tiny spheres which together resemble hard fish roe. This is composed of eggs; hence the name o√∂lite. The process goes on today in the seas off the Bahamas (Kirkaldy p. 59). Much of it also contains marine shells, notably of oyster. Subsequently, the site was submerged less deeply so that the overlying Blisworth Clay was deposited in brackish conditions. (Gallois p. 20) The stratum is known as Blisworth Limestone because it was first studied at Blisworth in Northamptonshire when the Blisworth tunnel was being dug for what is now called the Grand Union Canal. The tunnel finally opened in 1805. Occurrence Blisworth limestone is a generally thin but widely spread deposit in eastern England. It becomes thicker as one progresses southward from north Lincolnshire or westward from Norfolk. In the King's Lynn district, it is a shelly oolitic limestone 1 to 2 m thick. At Wiggenhall it is around 190m below mean sea level (OD) and at Tydd St Mary, around 140m. (Gallois) At Bourne, Lincolnshire, at the eastern edge of the Jurassic ridge, it is around 15m below OD. (BGS sheet 144) It is exposed at the surface around the valleys of the East and West Glen rivers (River Glen, Lincolnshire) in which vicinity it is 2.4 to 4.8 metres thick. (BGS sheet 143). Its exposure continues southward in a similar relationship to the Jurassic ridge, to the west of Peterborough. (BGS sheet 157) Around Towcester it reaches a thickness of 9m. (Hains & Horton p. 85) Application Blisworth limestone is used as a building material, in particular as blocks of stone. Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire is made from Blisworth limestone.

Johann Ludwig Christian Carl Gravenhorst (November 14, 1777 ‚Äì January 14, 1857), sometimes Jean Louis Charles or Carl, was a German entomologist, herpetologist, and zoologist. Life Gravenhorst was born in Braunschweig. His early interest in insects was encouraged by two of his professors, both amateur entomologists. He entered the University of Helmstedt to study law in 1797. However, the death of his father two years later left him a great fortune; so he was able to change his direction. He enrolled at the University of G√∂ttingen where he followed the courses of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. He returned to present his thesis to Helmst√§dt on a subject of entomology. He went to Paris in 1802 and there met Georges Cuvier, Pierre Andr√© Latreille, and Alexandre Brongniart. Parallel to his studies, he assembled, thanks to his financial means, a very important natural history collection. In 1805, he obtained a professorial chair in G√∂ttingen and published the following year Monographie Coleopterorum. Among his work, Gravenhorst's studies of the parasitic wasps is especially important, but he also worked in herpetology. He settled in Frankfurt (Oder) in 1810, teaching natural history at the university of the city. The following year, the university was transferred to Breslau. There he became director of the Breslau Natural History Museum and installed his own collections there. He started to suffer from mental disorders after 1825, stopping all scientific work in the year 1840, and withdrawing completely into himself in 1856. He died in Breslau. Achievements Gravenhorst was a specialist in Staphylinidae and Ichneumonidae describing many new species. He was also one of the first frog specialists.

Cooper performed in both the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the American Basketball Association (ABA) with the Baltimore Bullets, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets and the Indiana Pacers. Early years Cooper played basketball in high school at Mount Saint Joseph in Baltimore. In the locker room, he performed impersonations of Elvis Presley. One night, he was tricked by his friends to go on stage at a dance, where he performed \\"Hound Dog\\". His photo was placed in the school's yearbook with the caption: \\"Mt.

Dancing career Dancing Harry first started dancing at basketball games around 1969. The Baltimore crowd was dead, and he had been drinking a few beers when his friends convinced him to dance. While performing in Baltimore, he befriended Monroe. When Monroe moved to play for the Knicks, Cooper followed and brought his act to New York. Late in the 1971‚Äì72 season, Cooper asked the Knicks for permission to dance at their games, but he was denied. He went to a Knicks game anyway, arriving at halftime in a game that the Boston Celtics led by 20. The Knicks Willis Reed asked Cooper why he was not dancing. Cooper told him the front office did not approve. \\"The hell with the front office, Harry. Do something!'\\", Reed said. Cooper started dancing, the crowd cheered, and the Knicks eventually won the game. Dancing Harry became a celebrity. He donned outlandish outfits with a black cap, a floppy cap or hat, and often had platform shoes. His hexes excited the crowd and distracted opponents, adding to the Knicks' already formidable home-court advantage. He never received any compensation from the Knicks. In 1973, the Knicks won an NBA championship, but rumors circulated during the playoffs that the Knicks front office was not crazy with Harry. Their owner, Ned Irish, was a traditionalist. When Cooper arrived for 1973‚Äì74 season, ushers at the Knicks home at Madison Square Garden told Cooper he could not dance, and he was ejected when he tried anyway. Cooper took his act to Nassau Coliseum, where he was welcomed by the New Jersey Nets. With Dancing Harry performing, the Nets with star Julius Erving won the 1974 ABA championship. Harry also danced at some New York Yankees home games in 1974 at Shea Stadium while Yankee Stadium was undergoing renovations.Audio tape of 9/25/74 Yankees radio broadcast. Harry danced for another decade, including a move to Indianapolis, where he became the Indiana Pacers' first mascot and was paid nightly. The New York Daily News called Harry a \\"trailblazer of sorts\\", even though he never danced for Portland, as nearly every NBA team by 2003 had a paid squad of dancers, providing entertainment other than basketball as part of the game experience. He also inspired Dancing Barry, who debuted at a Houston Rockets game against the Knicks in the 1975 NBA Playoffs. Later years Cooper returned to Baltimore in the mid-1980s to care for his ailing mother. As of 2003, he worked as a skycap at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.

Caranus (Greek: ; died 329 BC), a Macedonian member of the elite cavalry body known as the hetairoi (Greek:·ºëœÑŒ±·øñœÅŒøŒπ) , was one of the generals sent by Alexander the Great against Satibarzanes when, for a second time, he had encouraged Aria to revolt. Caranus and his colleagues were successful in achieving their objective by defeating and slaying Satibarzanes in the winter of 330 BC. In 329 BC, Caranus was appointed, together with Andromachus and Menedemus, under the command of the Lycian Pharnuches, to act against Spitamenes, the revolted satrap of Sogdiana. Their approach compelled him to raise the siege of Maracanda; but, in a battle which ensued, he defeated them with the help of a body of Scythian cavalry, and forced them to fall back on the river Polytimetus, the wooded banks of which promised shelter. The rashness however or cowardice of Caranus led him to attempt the passage of the river with the cavalry under his command, and the rest of the troops plunging in after him in haste and disorder, they were all destroyed by the enemy.

WNTP is owned by Salem Media Group and broadcasts a conservative talk radio format. The station's studios and transmitter facilities are shared with co-owned WFIL (560 AM) in Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania. History For many years, 990 was known as WIBG, and had great success in the ratings playing Top 40 music in the 1950s and early 1960s with popular hosts including Joe \\"The Rockin' Bird\\" Niagara, Hy Lit, Billy Wright Sr., Frank X. Feller, and others. Beginning in 1945, the Wanamaker Organ was broadcast live from the Philadelphia department store each Monday through Saturday from 10:05 to 10:30 am. The original call letters stood for \\"I Believe in God\\" for the station's original religious format when founded in the 1920s by St. Paul's Episcopal Church, though as \\"Wibbage\\", the call became best known for, and most associated with, rock 'n' roll programming. In September 1966, WFIL moved to a Top 40 format and before long passed Wibbage (hampered by a poor suburban nighttime signal) in the ratings. WIBG soldiered on as a Top 40 station through most of the first half of the 1970s, including radio greats John Records Landecker, and Johnny \\"Long John\\" Wade, although they tried progressive rock for a time early in the decade. At mid-decade, the station tried a more adult contemporary approach, with sports talk at night for a time and even one year (1976) as the flagship station for Philadelphia Phillies baseball. In 1977, management decided that the WIBG image was no longer an asset; after a highly publicized final week featuring many of the personalities from the station's peak years, the call letters were changed to WZZD. WIBG and overnight talk show host Don Cannon were featured in the famous \\"egg yolk drinking\\" scene in the movie Rocky playing in the background while the Philadelphia fighter played by Sylvester Stallone cracks 6 raw eggs into a glass and chugs them down.http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/08/22/don-cannon- philadelphia-radio-legend-passed/ The station began to call itself \\"The All New Wizzard 100\\", and adopted a heavily researched Top 40 format. Listeners did not respond, and the format was changed to disco, which did not fare much better. In 1980, the station was sold to Christian broadcaster Communicom, which began airing contemporary Christian music and Christian teaching and features similar to sister station (and another former top 40 station) 970 WWDJ in Hackensack, New Jersey. But by then, the call letters WIBG had already been reassigned and the WZZD calls was retained. WZZD played music about half the day and Christian programs and features during the other half of the day. The WZZD antenna was redesigned in 1986 to reduce the number of towersFrom 5 to 4; the 5th tower's footing, which is northwest of the present Tower 1, can be seen on aerial views. and greatly improve coverage to the north and west, a change that if it had been made in the 1960s may have improved the success of WIBG in its battle with WFIL. In 1994, Communicom sold WZZD to Salem Media. Under Salem, WZZD kept the Christian music and teaching format initially. But by the late 1990s, music was cut back to a couple of hours a day. By 2002, WZZD ran nearly all teaching and almost no music at all. In 2004, WZZD and WFIL's features and programs were merged onto WFIL as WZZD dropped the Christian format in favor of conservative news-talk, changing its call letters to WNTP. Beginning in 2006, WNTP became the flagship station for the Saint Joseph's University Hawks college basketball radio network, as well as airing college sports of Penn State University, Drexel University, and the University of Pennsylvania for the Philadelphia audience. In 2007,WNTP again redesigned and modified its daytime antenna, which has even further improved its signal in the suburban counties of Pennsylvania.

It runs through the Spanish Pyrenees, passing only briefly into France near Candanchu. From West to East, the trail starts at Cape Higuer (Basque Country), crosses Navarre and Aragon and finishes at Cap de Creus (Catalonia.) Its exact distance is difficult to measure, roughly 840 km (522 miles) and a total elevation change of 39,000 m (128,000 ft). The route is separated into 45 sections. At the end of each section there is normally a useful stopping point (camping spot, town, hostel or refuge) but in general, supplies have to be carried for 3‚Äì4 days. Because most rivers flow perpendicular to the trail, the GR 11 passes over many valleys affording beautiful vistas but also many ascents and descents - some days as much as 1600 m (5250 ft) ascent (with equivalent descent). The trail can be walked in either direction - the deciding factors being the steepness of the terrain and the Sun. In the eastern (Catalan Pyrenees) and central part of the route (Aragonese Pyrenees), days are hotter and the profile more steep, which can prove physically challenging, especially for individuals who are less physically fit. The heat is much better tackled when the body has acclimated and physical conditioning has improved toward the end of the trip. Although walking East might provide a more comfortable start, it implies facing the Sun during the morning. Fit walkers normally manage to complete it in about 44 days, although some people have been known to complete it in 24 days or less. The GR 10 is a similar route but on the French side of the border while the Haute Randonn√©e Pyr√©n√©enne (HRP) follows a generally higher route through the Pyrenees, frequently crossing the French-Spanish border.

CIRUS was supplied by Canada in 1954, but used heavy water (deuterium oxide) supplied by the United States. It was the second nuclear reactor to be built in India. It was modeled on the Canadian Chalk River National Research X-perimental (NRX) reactor. The 40 MW reactor used natural uranium fuel, while using heavy water as a moderator. It is a tank reactor type with a core size of 3.14 m (H) √ó 2.67 m (D). It first went critical July 10, 1960. The reactor was not under IAEA safeguards (which did not exist when the reactor was sold), although Canada stipulated, and the U.S. supply contract for the heavy water explicitly specified, that it only be used for peaceful purposes. Nonetheless, CIRUS produced some of India's initial weapons-grade plutonium stockpile,Exporting Disaster ~ The Cost of Selling CANDU Reactors (3). Ccnr.org.

History Phoenix CC is the oldest cricket club in Ireland, founded in 1830, by John Parnell, the father of Charles Stewart Parnell. The younger Parnell, famous for bringing Irish home rule to the forefront of the political agenda, was a member for a short time. It was founded about five years before Dublin University Cricket Club The club has been based in Dublin's Phoenix Park for nearly its entire history, apart from 1835-1853. During those years, Phoenix played their home games in fields near the current site of the Grand Canal, by Upper Baggot Street. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1970s, Phoenix was the dominant club in Leinster cricket. =Early years= Prior to 1834, the club members met and practised in the Phoenix Park, but in 1835 the club moved out of the Park and played in matches in the open fields south of the canal. Two of the prestigious early members of the club, Lord Dunloe and Lord Clonbrock, were also on the 1833 members list at the MCC. Together with V.E. Alcock, they were mainly responsible for the club expanding and developing over its first 20 years until it reached its zenith as the \\"Premier Club of Ireland,\\" a contemporaneous description by the newspapers. All the founder-members were later given \\"Life Membership\\" in recognition of their service to the club. In February 1853, the club relocated to the Phoenix Park. As the club continued to prosper, the membership increased each year and 20 to 25 matches were played annually. However, in 1846 the road through the Phoenix Park was widened and the club had to move again. A new ground in an adjacent area was recommended, and in view of the expense already incurred by the Club the move was financed by the \\"Board of Works,\\" at a cost of ¬£73 and Phoenix has been at its present ground since 1847. =International cricket= The first Irish tour to North America was in 1879. Of the thirteen games played against the Philadelphia cricket club, ten were won, two were drawn and one was lost. South Africa made its second visit to Ireland in 1901. At this time, a dispute arose over the method of selecting the Irish team, and as a result, two of the leading Dublin clubs withdrew their names from selection, as did the Northern clubs. The Irish team eventually selected had ten Phoenix men and Bill Harrington of Leinster. (Though Leinster was a party to the dispute, Harrington was also a member of the County Kildare Club, which had kept out of the dispute). Disputes were no uncommon at the time, a few years earlier six Phoenix men had withdrawn from an Irish team because of insufficient Phoenix representation. By 1902, the quarrel over selecting the Irish team was over, and a squad was selected to play a trial match at the Phoenix ground in May 1902. This was selected for a short tour in England. The first match was against W. G. Grace's London County side, and the Irish team won. The third match was at Oxford, with the Irish team losing by 62 runs. The last match was against Cambridge, and Ireland won by 58 runs. =Leinster Senior League= The Leinster Senior League was formed in 1919 and, while Phoenix had a considerably reduced membership due to the Troubles, the Phoenix team was still up to par. The subconscious policy of being a club for officers and gentlemen still persisted, while the practice of electing a captain on a match-to-match basis continued up until 1932 when W. R. Allen became the first captain appointed for a whole season. =Centenary celebrations= The Phoenix centenary was celebrated without too much pomp and fuss with a match against R. H. Lambert's selected XI, though the game was rain-affected. =Later years= The years 1950‚Äì1970 were without the glory of the previous years due to an aging team. Despite 2 cups in the 1950s, the next decade was without a major trophy during the whole of that decade. In the latter part of the 1960s one of the most cohesive and formidable teams in the history of Leinster cricket began to emerge. After 22 years, Phoenix won the John Player Senior cup in 1973. In 1974 the team won the inaugural Wiggins Teape League and the following year accomplished the Grand Slam winning all three of Leinster senior trophies. For an entire decade the Phoenix 1st XI fielded no more than fifteen players during which time it won: 1973: John Player Senior Cup 1974: Wiggins Teape Competition 1975: Leinster Senior League / John Player Senior Cup / Wiggins Teape Competition 1976: John Player Senior Cup 1977: John Player Senior Cup 1978: Leinster Senior League / John Player Senior Cup 1979: Leinster Senior League / John Player Senior Cup By 1980, when Phoenix C.C. celebrated its 150 years jubilee, the club fielded 4 teams in Leinster men's cricket, 2 schoolboys XIs (under 13s and under 15s) and 2 Ladies XIs. In the early years of the 21st century, Phoenix C.C. has looked to the challenge of fostering the endless fascination and joy of cricket in a new generation of players, to follow in the tradition and the legacy of Ireland's oldest cricket club. Fans are affectionately known as \\"The Flamers\\". In recent years they've adopted a reworded version of \\"Eternal Flame\\" by The Bangles as a club anthem.

Hundreds were once used as a basis for representation in the Delaware General Assembly, and while their names still appear on all real estate transactions, they presently have no meaningful use or purpose except as a geographical point of reference. Boundaries and formation St. Georges Hundred is that portion of New Castle County that lies south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the small remaining portion of St. Georges Creek, and north of Appoquinimink Creek, extended generally westward from its headwaters to the Maryland state line, excepting a small area south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, west of Summit Bridge and north of Back Creek. It was one of the original hundreds in Delaware created in 1682 and was named for St. Georges Creek that once flowed along its northern boundary. Today most of the bed of St. Georges Creek has been used by the route of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which has effectively replaced it. Originally, the default boundary of Delaware and Maryland was the vague height of land between the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay drainage basins and St. Georges Hundred extended only to that point. With the running of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line in 1767, the western boundary of Delaware was established in its present location and became a portion of St. Georges Hundred‚Äôs western boundary. The towns of Middletown and Odessa and the community of Port Penn are in St. Georges Hundred. Development St. Georges Hundred is rural and agricultural in places, but there has been considerable residential and commercial development in the 1980s and 1990s which continues to this day.

Publication Under Warhammer experts Rick Priestly and Andy Jones and author Marc Gascoigne, the idea for the Black Library slowly evolved and produced the magazine Inferno! as a result beginning in July 1997. Inferno! was launched with a trial \\"issue zero\\" as a section in the Games Workshop house magazine White Dwarf (issue 210). Issue 1 of the actual magazine was launched shortly afterwards under the editorship of Games Workshop staffer Andy Jones. The magazine settled into a standard format of two fantasy and two science fiction stories per issue, with ancillary features such as standalone artwork, comics, cutaway diagrams of fictional machines from the stories, maps of fictional battles, and mocked-up books, dossiers, or correspondence by characters in the settings. With the exception of one early comic series, Inferno! published individual, complete stories, not serials. Creators Inferno! had a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions and publishing new authors. Many writers who went on to publish novels for Black Library, such as C.L. Werner and Ben Counter, began their professional writing careers with short stories in Inferno! The magazine also published stories by established science fiction authors such as Barrington J. Bayley and Brian Stableford. Warhammer Monthly The success of Inferno!, along with the lessons learned and the contacts made during its early days, led to a spin-off comic, Warhammer Monthly. This produced longer comic stories in an anthology format common in British comics like 2000 AD (with whom it shared a lot of creators). As Marc Gascoigne puts it \\"It became obvious very quickly that the occasional comic strip in Inferno! along with the short stories was OK, but very soon what we needed to do was a proper comic, so about a year after Inferno! kicked in, Warhammer Monthly made its debut.\\" Novels Black Library's novel range also started life in Inferno!, \\"we had stories that were immediately thought of, at least internally by us, as pilots, tasters for a novel range\\" Cancellation Inferno! was cancelled in November 2004 after publishing 46 issues. Relaunch In 2018, Black Library relaunched Inferno! as a quarterly anthology series. The new Inferno! runs 300-400 pages and features serial and one-off short stories from both veteran Black Library authors and new writers. Each new volume has been accompanied by a limited time reprinting of issues of the original magazine: Issues 1-5 with Volume 1, 6-10 with Volume 2, 11-15 with Volume 3, and 16-25 with volume 4.

Miers On October 3, 2005, Harriet Miers was nominated for Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by President George W. Bush to replace retired Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Miers was, at the time, White House Counsel, and had previously served in several roles both during Bush's tenure as Governor of Texas and President. The nomination almost immediately drew criticism, much of it from within the President's own party: David Frum castigated an \\"unforced error\\", and Robert Bork denounced it a \\"disaster\\" and \\"a slap in the face to the conservatives who've been building up a conservative legal movement for the last 20 years.\\" Hearings before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee had been scheduled to begin on November 7, and members of the Republican leadership had stated before the nomination that they aimed to have the nominee confirmed before Thanksgiving (November 24). Miers withdrew her nomination on October 27, 2005, and Bush nominated Samuel Alito four days later. Selection process Bush with Miers during the announcement of her nomination On July 1, 2005, Sandra Day O'Connor announced her plan to retire as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, effective as of the date that her replacement was confirmed by the United States Senate. Bush appointed Miers as head of the search committee for candidates to replace O'Connor. On July 19, Bush announced that he had chosen John Roberts as O'Connor's replacement. After William Rehnquist died of complications from thyroid cancer on September 3, Bush withdrew this nomination and renominated Roberts for Chief Justice, to which he was confirmed. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) recommended Miers as O'Connor's successor.\\"I had recommended that the President consider nominating Ms. Miers because I was impressed with her record of achievement as the managing partner of a major Texas law firm and the first woman president of the Texas Bar Association. In those roles she was a strong supporter of law firm diversity policies and a leader in promoting legal services for the poor. \\"\\"I like Harriet Miers. As White House Counsel, she has worked with me in a courteous and professional manner. I am also impressed with the fact that she was a trailblazer for women as managing partner of a major Dallas law firm and as the first woman president of the Texas Bar Association. In my view, the Supreme Court would benefit from the addition of a justice who has real experience as a practicing lawyer. The current justices have all been chosen from the lower federal courts. A nominee with relevant non-judicial experience would bring a different and useful perspective to the Court. \\"\\"I continue to believe that Harriet Miers received a raw deal. She is an accomplished lawyer, a trailblazer for women and a strong advocate of legal services for the poor. Not only was she denied the up-down vote that my Republican colleagues say every nominee deserves, but she was never even afforded the chance to make her case to the Judiciary Committee.\\" Bush agreed with Reid's suggestion, factoring comments by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Pennsylvania) and ranking member Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) that Bush's nominees should be outside of the appellate court system. First Lady Laura Bush and Senator Hillary Clinton had also both publicly expressed hope that he would nominate a woman. On October 3, Bush nominated Miers to succeed O'Connor. Miers's background =Education= Miers attended Southern Methodist University, where she received a bachelor's degree in mathematics (1967) and a Juris Doctor degree (1970). However, Miers' education would later prove troublesome during her nomination process. Her academic background went against a tradition that had gained momentum since the late 1970s of appointing justices who had received their collegiate, legal, and other graduate education at elite institutions. At the time of her nomination, all sitting justices hailed from the leading \\"Top 14\\" law schools (specifically Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Northwestern). Consequently, as the nomination process developed, individuals across the partisan spectrum came to both denigrate Miers on account of her degrees as well as to paint them as a non-issue. Addressing her education, conservative columnist and Harvard- trained psychiatrist Charles Krauthammer contended that \\"the Supreme Court is an elite institution. It is not one of the 'popular' branches of government\\"; conversely, Harry Reid (a graduate of George Washington University Law School's part-time program) stated he did not feel an Ivy League pedigree was a necessary criterion for placement on the court. However, in the long run, discussion over Miers' academic credentials was overshadowed by the focus placed on her career history and ties to the Bush administration, with fears of \\"snobbery\\" calls quieting discussion. =Professional experience= Miers had clerked for the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, but had never served as a judge. She had neither taught nor written to any substantial extent on law. In private practice, as a corporate litigator at the law firm Locke Lord, Miers had courtroom experience, but a scant and undistinguished track record of litigating in federal court (almost none litigating constitutional issues), and had never argued a case before the Supreme Court. Speaking to Miers's lack of credentials, the White House quickly advanced the defense that 41 of the 110 Supreme Court Justices appointed to date had never served as a judge prior to their nomination. Some examples during the 20th century include Louis Brandeis (appointed 1916), Felix Frankfurter (1939), William O. Douglas (1939), Robert Jackson (1941), Earl Warren (1953), Abe Fortas (1965), Lewis Powell (1972), and William Rehnquist (1972). The White House's attempt to use this to placate opposition was at best ineffectual, and at worst, backfired: offering the comparison to Fortas or particularly Warren further inflamed opposition among conservatives, who do not look upon either as a great exemplar of the kind of Supreme Court justice desired. The White House also argued that 10 of the 34 Justices appointed since 1933 were appointed from positions within the President's administration (as was the case with Miers). These Justices include the aforementioned Powell, Warren, Frankfurter, and Douglas, as well as Arthur Goldberg and Tom C. Clark. Reid, who had previously floated Miers as an example of an acceptable nominee (further inflaming conservative hostility),http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/10/3/112632.shtml issued a statement: :In my view, the Supreme Court would benefit from the addition of a justice who has real experience as a practicing lawyer. The current justices have all been chosen from the lower federal courts. A nominee with relevant non-judicial experience would bring a different and useful perspective to the Court. Nomination issues Because little was known about Miers' position on divisive issues, and because she had no prior experience as a judge, her nomination was subject to debate on both sides. Many critics were concerned that her inner-circle relationship with the president and his staff could lead to conflicts of interests in court cases. Republican Senator Sam Brownback stated on Good Morning America that \\"[t]here's precious little to go on and a deep concern that this would be a Souter-type candidate.\\"; in reference to David Souter having been appointed by George H. W. Bush, yet Souter turned out to be considered a mostly liberal justice. =Positions on issues that might have come before the court= Abortion The subject of Roe v. Wade, among other abortion-related Supreme Court precedents, was highly topical in this nomination, in part because O'Connor had voted to overturn a number of state restrictions on abortion, often in narrowly divided 5‚Äì4 decisions. As the confirmation process proceeded, more became known about Miers' personal/judicial views on abortion. In 1989, when Miers was running for the Dallas City Council, she allegedly filled out a survey for the anti-abortion group Texas United for Life.Note that the document referenced does not contain her signature. The questionnaire sought to gauge candidates' feelings on the use of constitutional amendments or state laws to ban abortions in the event the Supreme Court overturned a 1973 ruling that established abortion rights. The questionnaire asked \\"If Congress passes a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution that would prohibit abortion except when it was necessary to prevent the death of the mother, would you actively support its ratification by the Texas Legislature.\\" Miers answered \\"yes\\" to this question and all others listed. Miers said in 1992 that she felt Supreme Court nominees should not be asked about how they would rule on abortion issues. In 1993, when the American Bar Association (ABA) opted to take a stance in favor of legal access to abortion, Miers fought to have the full membership of the ABA vote on the topic: \\"If we were going to take a position on this divisive issue, the members should have been able to vote.\\" It is not clear what impact, if any, her personal views would have had on her judicial rulings. The religious beliefs of nominees on abortion and other controversial social issues have been a significant part of confirmation hearings for nominees thought to have traditional religious beliefs. Some civil rights activists (notably the Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights, Notre Dame law professor Charles Rice in the National Review, the civil rights group the Center for Jewish Values and the conservative Catholic group Fidelis) consider such interrogation by senators to be a violation of the constitutional prohibition of any religious tests for federal office. Senator Brownback, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said there was a \\"good chance\\" he would vote against Miers if she testified that Roe v. Wade was \\"settled law\\". Miers withdrew her nomination shortly after an awkward dispute she had in a private talk with Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At issue was what she had said during their private talk about the right to privacy, a major underpinning of Roe v. Wade. Affirmative action As President of the Texas State Bar, Miers supported affirmative action, going so far as to continue a quota system for women and ethnic minorities practicing law in the state. Bob Dunn, the outgoing president of the organization, described Miers as \\"certainly one of the leaders\\" in supporting the quota system. The right to keep and bear arms Miers included the \\"right to keep and bear arms\\" in a list of \\"precious liberties\\" contained in a commentary she authored in 1992. Gay rights Although Miers did not make her position clear on gay rights, she hinted at her views in answering a questionnaire submitted to her by a Texas gay rights group during her 1989 campaign for a Dallas City Council position. Miers indicated on the questionnaire that she supported civil rights for homosexuals, but opposed the repeal of the sodomy laws that were ultimately overturned by a 6‚Äì3 decision (with Justice O'Connor in the majority) in Lawrence v. Texas. Miers was mistakenly thought to have served on the board of the ex-gay organization Exodus International; she had actually served on the board of Exodus Ministries, a former prisoner rehabilitation organization. Balance of powers As President of the Texas State Bar, Miers fought legislation that would curtail the power of the Texas Supreme Court to limit attorneys fees in tort lawsuits. Some commentators have asked whether this portends a lack of respect for the proper role of the courts. For example, conservative activist Mark Levin responded to this information by saying, \\"[i]f there is a bias toward judicial supremacy, it's best that we know this now, in advance of a confirmation vote.\\" Miers' rationale for withdrawing her nomination‚Äîthat she feared the Senate's demand for information about her White House work would force a breach of Executive Branch secrecy‚Äîmay indicate that she supported expansive presidential powers. =Other potential controversies: the Texas Lottery Commission= From 1995 to 2000, Miers chaired the Texas Lottery Commission (having been appointed by Bush when he was Governor of Texas). In 1997, the Commission hired Lawrence Littwin as the lottery's executive director; five months later, he was fired. Littwin brought suit over his firing, alleging that the lottery contractor, GTech Corporation, had influenced the Commission to fire him for improper reasons. GTech settled the case by paying him $300,000, with Littwin agreeing not to discuss the case or the settlement. Reactions to her nomination Miers' nomination drew criticism from both political parties. Principal complaints focused on her credentials, which critics charged were insufficient for the position. Liberals and many conservatives also charged that her nomination was the result of political cronyism. Since her legal experience did not compare to that of other possible candidates, like federal appellate judges Edith Jones, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown, it was deemed likely that President Bush nominated Miers for her personal loyalty to him rather than for her qualifications. In letters to then-Governor Bush dating from 1997, she wrote, \\"You are the best governor ever - deserving of great respect,\\" called Bush \\"cool,\\" and wrote that he and his wife, Laura, were \\"the greatest!\\" She was compared to Michael Brown, a Bush appointee alleged to have gotten his position based on loyalty rather than experience. Brown had resigned as chief of FEMA exactly three weeks prior to Miers' nomination, amidst nearly universal condemnation of how he and his agency handled Hurricane Katrina. Conservatives complained that there was no written record to demonstrate that she was either a strict constructionist or originalist in her approach to constitutional interpretation. Notable conservative commentators expressing these or other concerns included newspaper columnists Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, Charles Krauthammer, William Kristol, Rush Limbaugh, Ramesh Ponnuru, and George Will; former Bush speechwriter David Frum; and constitutional scholar Randy Barnett. Finally, Robert Bork, one of the premier advocates of originalism and a Supreme Court nominee under President Reagan who was eventually rejected by the Senate, proclaimed that the nomination was \\"a disaster on every level,\\" and a \\"slap in the face\\" to conservatives. In addition to the initial positive comments from Democratic Senator Harry Reid, some prominent Republican conservatives were supportive of Miers, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich,Topic Galleries - baltimoresun.com Focus on the Family founder James Dobson (who later suggested he would have recanted his endorsement if she had not withdrawn), Senator John Cornyn of Texas, columnist Mark Steyn, and former Indiana Senator Dan Coats,Topic Galleries - Courant.com who became the Bush administration's appointed guide for Miers through the confirmation process. In mid-October, the Senate Judiciary Committee requested Miers resubmit her judicial questionnaire after members complained her answers were \\"inadequate,\\" \\"insufficient,\\" and \\"insulting.\\" Reports that the administration had told party activists that Miers would oppose abortion rights led the Judicial Committee to ask Miers if she had ever disclosed to anyone how she might rule from the bench. In the same question, it also requested information about \\"all communications by the Bush administration or individuals acting on behalf of the administration to any individuals or interest groups with respect to how you would rule.\\" Miers wrote just one word in response: \\"No.\\" Robert Schenck had access to Harriet Miers during her brief Supreme Court nomination and took exception that she was attending St. John's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C. rather than a local chapter of the more fundamentalist Church of Christ as she had done back in Texas. The news of the nomination and Bush's support of Miers' nomination in part inspired satirist Stephen Colbert to create the term \\"Truthiness,\\" meaning to know things intuitively without regard for evidence. Colbert said in the guise of his character on The Colbert Report: Following the October 3 nomination of Miers for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court by President George W. Bush; then Ohio Senator Mike DeWine stated that \\"I think the fact she doesn't have judicial experience will add to the diversity of the Supreme Court. There is no reason everyone has to have that same [judicial] background.\\" Withdrawal President George W. Bush withdrew his nomination of Harriet Miers shortly after an awkward dispute she had with Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At issue was what she had said during their private talk about the right to privacy, an underpinning of the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing abortion rights. Bush stated that Miers asked to withdraw her nomination on October 27, 2005, and he acceded to her wishes. The narrative where Miers jumped rather than being pushed was accepted at first, but has since been challenged. Most prominently, Jan Crawford Greenburg reported that Miers' abysmal performance in murder boards before the hearings made clear to White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and Deputy White House Counsel William K. Kelley that the game was up, at which point, they demanded Miers withdraw. After initial resistance, she acquiesced.See Jan Crawford Greenburg, SUPREME CONFLICT 282-4 (2007). Bush and Miers attributed her withdrawal to requests from the Judiciary Committee for the release of internal White House documents that the administration had insisted were protected by executive privilege. Both Republican and Democratic senators denied that they were attempting to obtain privileged documents. Most observers instead believed this rationale was a way for the Bush administration to pull her nomination and still \\"save face,\\" by avoiding a direct acknowledgment of the lack of support for her nomination. The claim of executive privilege had been publicly recommended as an \\"exit strategy\\" by commentators such as Charles Krauthammer, and reports indicated that White House advisors had considered that as a tactic. Samuel Alito, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, was nominated four days after her withdrawal and subsequently confirmed. References George W.

It is the administrative seat of the province of Rieti and see of the diocese of Rieti, as well as the modern capital of the Sabina region. The town centre stands on a small hilltop, commanding from the southern edge the wide Rieti valley, at the bottom of the Sabine hills and of monti Reatini, including mount Terminillo. The plain was once a large lake, drained by the ancient Romans, and is now the fertile basin of the Velino River. Only the small Ripasottile and Lungo lakes remain of the larger original. History Map showing the extension of the ancient lake which once occupied the Rieti valley; in darker blue, modern date rivers and lakes. =Prehistory= According to the legend, Reate was founded by Rea, a divinity (that would be the origin of the town name). It was founded at the beginning of the Iron Age (9th‚Äì8th century BC). Probably in earlier times the lands around Rieti were inhabited by Umbri, then by Aborigines and later on by Sabines, who reached the lands sited in the nearby of Tevere river. =Ancient era= Reate was originally a major site of the Sabine nation well before the foundation of Rome. According to the legend, when Romulus founded Rome, Romans kidnapped Sabine women in order to populate the town (The Rape of the Sabine Women) and this led to a war between Romans and Sabines. The battle of the Lacus Curtius came to an end only when the women threw themselves between the armies, begging the men who were by then their relatives to stop fighting. Romulus and Titus Tatius relented and a collaboration between the two people started. According to an account more based on history, Sabines settled on the Quirinale because of their continuous need for grazing-lands. After the final Roman conquest, carried out by Manius Curius Dentatus in the early 3rd century BC (290 BC), the village became a strategic point in the early Italian road network, dominating the \\"salt\\" track (Via Salaria) that linked Rome to the Adriatic Sea through the Apennines. Many lands of Reate and Amiternum were confiscated and allocated to Romans. From the outset, Sabines were offered Roman citizenship but without voting rights, until in 268 BC they gained full citizenship, and were incorporated into two new tribes (Velina and Quirina). Remains of the Roman bridge (3rd century BC) Curius Dentatus drained a large portion of the lake by diverting the Velino river into the Nera (thus giving birth to Marmore Falls). The wide area once occupied by the lake turned into a fertile plain (the Rieti Valley). Following Roman customs, the land was split into characteristic square allotments. The town itself underwent significant development, being re-organised according to typical Roman urban standards (e.g., two crossed roads make up the settlement's backbone), and was fortified with strong walls. A stone bridge was laid across the Velino river, and a large viaduct was built to bring goods from the Via Salaria directly to Rieti's southern gate. Roman Reate receives a number of mentions in Latin literature, thanks to its flourishing soil, its valued assets, and some peculiarities of the surroundings (such as wandering islands and hollow- subsurfaced fields). Cicero, for instance, describes the tensions between Reate and Interamna (Terni) following the lake drainage, and refers to the country houses (villae) that his friend Q. Axius owned in the plain. One of the most important Sabine families that gained success in Rome was the Gens Flavia, from which Emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus (who started the building of the Colosseum, also known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium) descended. The Reatin poet and writer Marcus Terentius Varro was born in 116 BC and he is usually referred to as the father of Roman erudition. =Middle Ages= The medieval walls After the fall of the Western Roman Empire Rieti suffered destruction by Barbarians, but never ceased to be an important gastaldate during the Lombard domination, as part of the Duchy of Spoleto. Under the Franks, it was the county capital. It was sacked by the Saracens in the 9th and 10th century and by the Norman king Roger II of Sicily in 1149. The city was rebuilt with the help of the Roman comune, and from 1198 was also a free commune, of Guelph orientation, with a podest√† of its own. St. Mary Cathedral As a favourite Papal seat, Rieti was the place of important historical events: Constance of Hauteville married here by proxy Emperor Henry VI (1185). Charles I of Anjou was crowned King of Apulia, Sicily and Jerusalem by Pope Nicholas I in 1289. Pope Gregory IX celebrated canonized St. Dominic in Rieti (1234). =Late Middle Ages and modern era= After the Papal seat had been moved to Avignon, Rieti was conquered by the King of Naples, while inner struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines broke out. In 1354 it was won back by Cardinal Albornoz, and it later became a feudal seigneury of the Alfani family within the Papal States. More of the surrounding plain was drained in the following century, but this led to confrontation with the neighboring Terni. Rieti was province capital of the Papal States from 1816 to 1860. After the unification of Italy, it was initially part of Umbria, being annexed to Lazio in 1923. It became the provincial capital on January 2, 1927. Climate Rieti has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csb), which in contrast to most of dry-summer Italy, which mostly has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa). Government Main sights Fontana dei delfini. Loggia and gardens of Palazzo Vicentini. San Rufo church, in the square considered the centre of Italy. St. Augustine church. Mount Terminillo in summer. The ancient Sabine and Roman city was crowded with buildings, including baths (thermae). Only scarce remains were found during excavations in 19th and 20th century: the foundations of a large temple, the stone floor of the main square (forum), walls from private houses, concrete vaults, statues and pottery items. The most striking remains are the stone bridge across the Velino river and the viaduct. Piazza San Rufo is traditionally considered to be the exact centre of Italy (Latin Umbilicus Italiae). Other sights include: *Rieti Cathedral: Construction started in 1109 over a pre-existing basilica, was consecrated in 1225 and almost entirely rebuilt in 1639.

The interior, on Latin cross plan with one nave and two aisles, has mainly Baroque decorations, including a St. Barbara sculpted by Giannantonio Mari (1657), probably designed by Bernini. Antoniazzo Romano contributed a fresco. It also houses canvases from 16th and 17th centuries. The crypt corresponds to the most ancient part of the church, consecrated in 1157. The Baptistery has an elegant 15th-century baptismal font. *Palazzo Vescovile (\\"Bishops Palace\\" or \\"Papal Palace\\"): Construction begun in 1283. Noteworthy are the loggia and eight Renaissance-style windows from 1532. The lower floor is occupied by the so-called \\"Volte del Vescovado\\", a great portico with two naves of Gothic arcades. The Grand Hall houses the Diocese Gallery. Vaults of Palazzo Vescovile, also known as the Papal Palace. *Palazzo Comunale (\\"Town Hall\\", 13th century, rebuilt in the 18th century), facing Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, a square corresponding to the ancient Roman forum.

The most important road link is strada statale 4 Via Salaria, which connects Rieti with Rome at south and with Ascoli Piceno and the Adriatic sea at north, just like the ancient Via Salaria Roman road. Other major roads include the strada statale 79 Ternana, which connects Rieti with Terni and with the Orte gate of Autostrada A1; strada statale 17, which branches from strada statale 4 in Antrodoco, connects Rieti with L'Aquila; strada statale 578 Salto Cicolana, which connects Rieti with Avezzano and with the Salto valley gate of A24 and A25 autostradas. Rieti's railway station Rieti's railway station is located on the regional, low traffic Terni‚ÄìSulmona railway, with trains to Terni and L'Aquila.Trains departing from the station of Rieti There is no direct railway link between Rieti and Rome, as the construction of such railway has been subject of a long debate but never took place; Rome can be reached by bus or by catching a train to the Terni station, where direct trains to Rome can be found.Trains departing from the station of Terni The Rieti Airport is mainly used by small private planes and for gliding.

The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s‚Äì40s, peaked in the reign of Poland's last king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (second half of the 18th century), went into decline with the Third Partition of Poland (1795) ‚Äì a national tragedy inspiring a short period of sentimental writing ‚Äì and ended in 1822, replaced by Romanticism.Jerzy Snopek, \\"The Polish Literature of the Enlightenment.\\" (PDF 122 KB) Poland.pl. History Polish Enlightenment, while sharing many common qualities with the classical Enlightenment movements of Western Europe, also differed from them in many important aspects. Much of the thought of the Western Enlightenment evolved under the oppressive absolute monarchies and was dedicated towards fighting for more freedom. Western thinkers desired Montesquieu's separation and balance of powers to restrict the nearly unlimited power of their monarchs. Polish Enlightenment, however, developed in a very different background. The Polish political system was almost the opposite of the absolute monarchy: Polish kings were elected and their position was very weak, with most of the powers in the hands of the parliament (Sejm). Polish reforms desired the elimination of laws that transformed their system into a near-anarchy, resulting from abuse of consensus voting in Sejm (liberum veto) that paralyzed the Commonwealth, especially during the times of the Wettin dynasty, reducing Poland from a major European player to the puppet of its neighbours. Thus, while men of the Enlightenment in France and Prussia wrote about the need for more checks and balances on their kings, Polish Enlightenment was geared towards fighting the abuses stemming from too many checks and balances. Portrait of the Prozor Family by Franciszek Smuglewicz, 1789 The differences did not end there. Townsfolk and bourgeoisie dominated Western Enlightenment movement, while in the Commonwealth most of the reformers came from szlachta (nobility). Commonwealth szlachta (forming the 10% of its population) considered the idea of equality to be one of the foundations of its culture, and reformers fought to expand it towards other social classes. Religious tolerance, was an ideal of the szlachta. =Constitution of 1791= Ideas of that period led eventually to the Constitution of May 3, 1791 and other reforms (like the creation of the Commission of National Education, first ministry of education in the world) which attempted to transform the Commonwealth into a modern constitutional monarchy. Although attempts of political reform were thwarted by the civil war (Targowica Confederation) and military intervention of the Commonwealth neighbour, ending in the partitions of Poland, the cultural impact of that period persevered Polish culture for many years. Za≈Çuski Library, the first public library in Poland, under construction. 1801 watercolor by Zygmunt Vogel. National Museum, Warsaw The ideas of the Polish Enlightenment had also significant impact abroad. From the Bar Confederation (1768) through the period of the Great Sejm and until the aftermath of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, Poland experienced a large output of political, particularly constitutional, writing. Important institutions of the Enlightenment included the National Theatre founded in 1765 in Warsaw by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski; and in the field of advanced learning: the Commission of National Education established by the Sejm in 1773; the Society for Elementary Books; as well as the Corps of Cadets (Knight's military school) among others. In expanding the field of knowledge, there was the Society of Friends of Science set up in 1800 soon after the Partitions.

The mall's anchor stores are Von Maur, Mattress Firm, JCPenney, and Boot Barn. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Younkers. History Frederick Watson, a developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota, first unveiled plans for Valley West Mall in 1971. The Meredith Corporation initially objected to the mall since it was right next to a site where Meredith planned to build its new corporate headquarters, but Meredith withdrew its plan to relocate there in June 1971. A dispute with Dayton Hudson Corporation over plans to put a Dayton's department store at Valley West Mall also delayed construction. After Davenport-based Petersen Harned Von Maur signed a lease agreement to anchor the mall in mid-1974, Dayton Hudson unsuccessfully sued Watson, claiming it was promised a spot in the mall. The legal battle against Dayton Hudson also led to a delay in signing a third anchor store after Von Maur and Omaha-based Brandeis, as JCPenney refused to sign a lease agreement until the suit was settled. Valley West Mall opened August 4, 1975, with about 20 stores and its first anchor, Brandeis. The mall's grand opening ceremony was held on July 28, 1976, with the opening of the second anchor, Petersen Harned Von Maur, and an additional 40 specialty stores. JCPenney, the third anchor, opened in March 1977 to complete the mall. Brandeis was acquired by Younkers in 1987. Petersen Harned Von Maur changed its name to Von Maur in 1989. By 2000, Valley West was the Des Moines area's most-visited mall with an average of 40,000 shoppers per day. Plans for a fourth anchor store at Valley West Mall were announced on two separate occasions but never materialized. In March 1999, Dillard's signed a letter of intent with Watson Centers to build a $30 million store and parking ramp, but the letter of intent expired in August 2000, and Dillard's located in the new Jordan Creek Town Center instead. In May 2001, Galyan's (now Dick's Sporting Goods) announced a plan to build an anchor store, but by January 2003, it backed out of its plan to enter the Des Moines market. While Jordan Creek was under construction, Valley West underwent an interior renovation that was completed in August 2003. A food court joined the mall in 1998, replacing a vacated Dunham's Sports. =Legal issues= On December 24, 1998, a group of activists passed out handbills outside of Valley West Mall's JCPenney store that accused Phillips-Van Heusen, whose clothing line was sold at JCPenney, of promoting sweatshop conditions. The activists were removed by West Des Moines police and arrested for trespassing. Two of them sued the city of West Des Moines and took their case to the Iowa Supreme Court, arguing that malls like Valley West had become large public gathering places where they had the right to freedom of speech. West Des Moines, on the other hand, argued that Valley West was a private property and the owners would lose control of their property if handbill distribution was allowed. On April 3, 2002, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of West Des Moines. Valley West Mall and Merle Hay Mall were plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the city of West Des Moines over the construction of Jordan Creek Town Center. The suit, which claimed that West Des Moines was illegally using tax increment financing money to improve the infrastructure around Jordan Creek, was dismissed by the Iowa Supreme Court on February 27, 2002. On April 18, 2018 it was announced that Younkers would be closing as the parent, Bon-Ton Stores, was going out of business. The store closed on August 29, 2018.

Hundreds were once used as a basis for representation in the Delaware General Assembly, and while their names still appear on all real estate transactions, they presently have no meaningful use or purpose except as a geographical point of reference. It is named after Pencader, Carmarthenshire, Wales. Boundaries and Formation Pencader Hundred is that portion of western New Castle County that lies south and west of the Christiana River, north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and generally west of Salem Church Road and Red Lion Road (DE Route 71). It also includes a large area north and east of the Christiana River generally from the old Pennsylvania Railroad tracks to Cooch‚Äôs Bridge, as well as another small area south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, west of Summit Bridge and north of Back Creek. Finally, it excludes the small area west of the Christiana River immediately west of Newark. It was formed from portions of New Castle Hundred, Christiana Hundred and Red Lion Hundred in 1710. Originally, the default boundary of Delaware and Maryland was the vague height of land between the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay drainage basins and Pencader Hundred extended only to that point. With the running the Mason‚ÄìDixon line in 1767, the western boundary of Delaware was established in its present location and became Pencader Hundred‚Äôs western boundary. A portion of the city of Newark and the Glasgow Census Designated Place (CDP) is in Pencader Hundred. Development Pencader Hundred is rural and agricultural in places, but there has been considerable residential and commercial development in the 1980s and 1990s which continues to this day. This area is among the fastest growing parts of Delaware. Geography Important geographical features, in addition to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, Christiana River, and Back Creek, include Five Mile Run, Chestnut Hill and Iron Hill. It is mostly in the coastal plain region on the Delmarva Peninsula, but an extension of the piedmont in the northwest corner provides a couple of prominent hills to the area. Transportation Important roads include portions of Interstate 95, the Pulaski Highway (U.S. Route 40), Summit Bridge Road (Delaware Route 896), and the old main highway between Wilmington and Baltimore, now Old Baltimore Pike. A portion of the old Delaware Railroad, subsequently the Delmarva branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad runs north-south at the eastern edge.

Proposed uses include excavation for the building of canals and harbours, electrical generation, the use of nuclear explosions to drive spacecraft, and as a form of wide-area fracking. PNEs were an area of some research from the late 1950s into the 1980s, primarily in the United States and Soviet Union. In the U.S., a series of tests were carried out under Project Plowshare. Some of the ideas considered included blasting a new Panama Canal, the use of underground explosions to create electricity, and a variety of geological studies. The largest of the excavation tests was carried out in the Sedan nuclear test in 1962, which released large amounts of radioactive gas into the air. By the late 1960s, public opposition to Plowshare was increasing, and a 1970s study of the economics of the concepts suggested they had no practical use. Plowshare saw decreasing interest from the 1960s, and was officially cancelled in 1977. The Soviet program started a few years after the U.S. efforts and explored many of the same concepts under their Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy program. The program was more extensive, eventually conducting 239 nuclear explosions. Some of these tests also released radioactivity, including a significant release of plutonium into the groundwater and the polluting of an area near the Volga River. A major part of the program in the 1970s and 80s was the use of very small bombs to produce shock waves as a seismic measuring tool, and as part of these experiments, two bombs were successfully used to seal blown-out oil wells. The program officially ended in 1988. As part of ongoing arms control efforts, both programs came to be controlled by a variety of agreements. Most notable among these is the 1976 Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes (PNE Treaty). The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 prohibits all nuclear explosions, regardless of whether they are for peaceful purposes or not. Since that time the topic has been raised several times, often as a method of asteroid impact avoidance. Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty In the PNE Treaty, the signatories agreed: not to carry out any individual nuclear explosions having a yield exceeding 150 kilotons TNT equivalent; not to carry out any group explosion (consisting of a number of individual explosions) having an aggregate yield exceeding 1,500 kilotons; and not to carry out any group explosion having an aggregate yield exceeding 150 kilotons unless the individual explosions in the group could be identified and measured by agreed verification procedures. The parties also reaffirmed their obligations to comply fully with the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963. The parties reserve the right to carry out nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes in the territory of another country if requested to do so, but only in full compliance with the yield limitations and other provisions of the PNE Treaty and in accord with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Articles IV and V of the PNE Treaty set forth the agreed verification arrangements. In addition to the use of national technical means, the treaty states that information and access to sites of explosions will be provided by each side, and includes a commitment not to interfere with verification means and procedures. The protocol to the PNE Treaty sets forth the specific agreed arrangements for ensuring that no weapon-related benefits precluded by the Threshold Test Ban Treaty are derived by carrying out a nuclear explosion used for peaceful purposes, including provisions for use of the hydrodynamic yield measurement method, seismic monitoring, and on-site inspection. The agreed statement that accompanies the treaty specifies that a \\"peaceful application\\" of an underground nuclear explosion would not include the developmental testing of any nuclear explosive. United States: Operation Plowshare One of the Chariot schemes involved chaining five thermonuclear devices to create the artificial harbor. Operation Plowshare was the name of the U.S. program for the development of techniques to use nuclear explosives for peaceful purposes. The name was coined in 1961, taken from Micah 4:3 (\\"And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\\"). Twenty-eight nuclear blasts were detonated between 1961 and 1973. One of the first U.S. proposals for peaceful nuclear explosions that came close to being carried out was Project Chariot, which would have used several hydrogen bombs to create an artificial harbor at Cape Thompson, Alaska. It was never carried out due to concerns for the native populations and the fact that there was little potential use for the harbor to justify its risk and expense. There was also talk of using nuclear explosions to excavate a second Panama Canal. The largest excavation experiment took place in 1962 at the Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. The Sedan nuclear test carried out as part of Operation Storax displaced 12 million tons of earth, creating the largest man-made crater in the world, generating a large nuclear fallout over Nevada and Utah. Three tests were conducted in order to stimulate natural gas production, but the effort was abandoned as impractical because of cost and radioactive contamination of the gas.. There were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare's 27 nuclear explosions. For example, the Project Gasbuggy site, located 55 miles east of Farmington, New Mexico, still contains nuclear contamination from a single subsurface blast in 1967. Other consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, due in large part to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.. Soviet Union: Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy The Soviet Union conducted a much more vigorous program of 239 nuclear tests, some with multiple devices, between 1965 and 1988 under the auspices of Program No. 6‚ÄîEmployment of Nuclear Explosive Technologies in the Interests of National Economy and Program No. 7‚ÄîNuclear Explosions for the National Economy. The initial program was patterned on the U.S. version, with the same basic concepts being studied. One test, Chagan test in January 1965, has been described as a \\"near clone\\" of the U.S. Sedan shot. Like Sedan, Chagan also resulted in a massive plume of radioactive material being blown high into the atmosphere, with an estimated 20% of the fission products with it. Detection of the plume over Japan led to accusations by the U.S. that the Soviets had carried out an above-ground test in violation of the Partial Test Ban Treaty, but these charges were later dropped. The later, and more extensive, \\"Deep Seismic Sounding\\" Program focused on the use of much smaller explosions for various geological uses. Some of these tests are considered to be operational, not purely experimental. These included the use of peaceful nuclear explosions to create deep seismic profiles. Compared to the usage of conventional explosives or mechanical methods, nuclear explosions allow the collection of longer seismic profiles (up to several thousand kilometres).. There are proponents for continuing the PNE programs in modern Russia. They state that the program already paid for itself, saved the USSR billions of rubles and could save more if continued. They also say that it is the only feasible way to put out large gushers and fires on natural gas deposits and the safest and most economically viable way to destroy chemical weapons. Their opponents, including the discredited\\"Nuclear opponents have a moral duty to get their facts straight \\"...report by Alexey Yablokov, Vassily Nesterenko and Alexey Nesterenko, which claims that 980,000 people died as a result of Chernobyl. As its critics have pointed out, this figure cannot possibly be correct...\\", Alexey Yablokov, state that all PNE technologies have non-nuclear alternatives and that many PNEs actually caused nuclear disasters. Reports on the successful Soviet use of nuclear explosions in extinguishing out-of-control gas well fires were widely cited in United States policy discussions of options for stopping the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Other nations Germany at one time considered manufacturing nuclear explosives for civil engineering purposes. In the early 1970s a feasibility study was conducted for a project to build a canal from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara Depression in the Western Desert of Egypt using nuclear demolition. This project proposed to use 213 devices, with yields of 1‚Äì1.5 megatons, detonated at depths of 100‚Äì500 m to build this canal for the purpose of producing hydroelectric power. The Smiling Buddha, India's first explosive nuclear device, was described by the Indian Government as a peaceful nuclear explosion. In Australia, nuclear blasting was proposed as a way of mining iron ore in the Pilbara.. Civil engineering and energy production The 1962 Sedan nuclear test formed a crater 100m (330 ft) deep with a diameter of about 390m (1,300 ft) as a means of investigating the possibilities of using peaceful nuclear explosions for large-scale earth moving. If this test was conducted in 1965, when improvements in device design were realized, a 100-fold reduction in radiation release was considered feasible.Declassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #35 c. 29:30 minutes The 140kt Soviet Chagan (nuclear test), comparable in yield to the Sedan test of 104kt, formed Lake Chagan, reportedly used as a watering hole for cattle and human swimming. Apart from their use as weapons, nuclear explosives have been tested and used, in a similar manner to chemical high explosives, for various non-military uses. These have included large-scale earth moving, isotope production and the stimulation and closing-off of the flow of natural gas. At the peak of the Atomic Age, the United States initiated Operation Plowshare, involving \\"peaceful nuclear explosions\\". The United States Atomic Energy Commission chairman announced that the Plowshare project was intended to \\"highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests\\".\\"semiannual report to Congress in January 1958\\".

The Operation Plowshare program included 27 nuclear tests designed towards investigating these non-weapon uses from 1961 through 1973. Due to the inability of the U.S. physicists to reduce the fission fraction of low-yield (approximately 1 kiloton) nuclear devices that would have been required for many civil engineering projects, when long-term health and clean-up costs from fission products were included in the cost, there was virtually no economic advantage over conventional explosives except for potentially the very largest projects.Declassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #35 c. 12:00 minutes Map of all proposed routes for a tunnel and/or canal route from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara Depression. No route was shorter than 55 kilometers in length. Canal-cutting investigations began with the buggy salvo shot of Operation Crosstie in 1967. The Qattara Depression Project was developed by Professor Friedrich Bassler during his appointment to the West German ministry of economics in 1968. He put forth a plan to create a Saharan lake and hydroelectric power station by blasting a tunnel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Qattara Depression in Egypt, an area that lies below sea level. The core problem of the entire project was the water supply to the depression. Calculations by Bassler showed that digging a canal or tunnel would be too expensive, therefore Bassler determined that the use of nuclear explosive devices, to excavate the canal or tunnel, would be the most economical. The Egyptian government declined to pursue the idea. The Soviet Union conducted a much more exhaustive program than Plowshare, with 239 nuclear tests between 1965 and 1988. Furthermore, many of the \\"tests\\" were considered economic applications, not tests, in the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy program. These included a 30 kilotons explosion being used to close the Uzbekistani Urtabulak gas well in 1966 that had been blowing since 1963, and a few months later a 47 kilotons explosive was used to seal a higher-pressure blowout at the nearby Pamuk gas field. U. S. Department of Energy contract no.: W-7405-Eng48. (For more details, see Blowout (well drilling)#Use of nuclear explosions.) Devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion-only reactions are possibly the Taiga Soviet peaceful nuclear explosions of the 1970s. Their public records indicate 98% of their 15 kiloton explosive yield was derived from fusion reactions, so only 0.3 kiloton was derived from fission.Disturbing the Universe ‚Äì Freeman DysonThe Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions by Milo D. Nordyke. Science & Global Security, 1998, Volume 7, pp. 1‚Äì117. See test shot \\"Taiga\\". The repeated detonation of nuclear devices underground in salt domes, in a somewhat analogous manner to the explosions that power a car‚Äôs internal combustion engine (in that it would be a heat engine), has also been proposed as a means of fusion power in what is termed PACER.John Nuckolls, \\"Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)\\", LLNL, June 12, 1998Ralph Moir, PACER development Other investigated uses for low- yield peaceful nuclear explosions were underground detonations to stimulate, by a process analogous to fracking, the flow of petroleum and natural gas in tight formations; this was developed most in the Soviet Union, with an increase in the production of many well heads being reported. =Terraforming= In 2015, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk popularized an approach in which the cold planet Mars could be terraformed by the detonation of high-fusion-yielding thermonuclear devices over the mostly dry-ice icecaps on the planet.Sorry, Elon Musk: One Does Not Simply Nuke Mars Into Habitability ‚ÄúIt is silly to expect Mars to become easily habitable.‚Äù Musk's specific plan would not be very feasible within the energy limitations of historically manufactured nuclear devices (ranging in mt), therefore requiring major advancement for it to be considered. In part due to these problems, the physicist Michio Kaku (who initially put forward the concept) instead suggests using nuclear reactors in the typical land-based district heating manner to make isolated tropical biomes on the Martian surface. Comet \\"Siding Spring\\" made a close approach to the planet Mars in October 2014. Alternatively, as nuclear detonations are presently somewhat limited in terms of demonstrated achievable yield, the use of an off-the-shelf nuclear explosive device could be employed to \\"nudge\\" a Martian-grazing comet toward a pole of the planet. Impact would be a much more efficient scheme to deliver the required energy, water vapor, greenhouse gases, and other biologically significant volatiles that could begin to quickly terraform Mars. One such opportunity for this occurred in October 2014 when a \\"once-in-a-million-years\\" comet (designated as C/2013 A1, also known as comet \\"Siding Spring\\") came within of the Martian atmosphere.Comet Siding Spring will pass by Mars only 139,500 km away--which would be like a comet passing about 1/3 of the distance between Earth and the Moon.Comet Grazes by Mars' Atmosphere in 'Once-In-A-Lifetime' Event By Luminary Daily Physics The element einsteinium was first discovered, in minute quantities, following the analysis of the fallout from the first thermonuclear atmospheric test.EINSTEINIUM AND FERMIUM, ALBERT GHIORSO, LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY The discovery and synthesis of new chemical elements by nuclear transmutation, and their production in the necessary quantities to allow study of their properties, was carried out in nuclear explosive device testing. For example, the discovery of the short- lived einsteinium and fermium, both created under the intense neutron flux environment within thermonuclear explosions, followed the first Teller-Ulam thermonuclear device test‚ÄîIvy Mike. The rapid capture of so many neutrons required in the synthesis of einsteinium would provide the needed direct experimental confirmation of the so-called r-process, the multiple neutron absorptions needed to explain the cosmic nucleosynthesis (production) of all chemical elements heavier than nickel on the periodic table in supernova explosions, before beta decay, with the r-process explaining the existence of many stable elements in the universe.Byrne, J. Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter, Dover Publications, Mineola, NY, 2011, (pbk.) pp. 267. The worldwide presence of new isotopes from atmospheric testing beginning in the 1950s led to the 2008 development of a reliable way to detect art forgeries. Paintings created after that period may contain traces of caesium-137 and strontium-90, isotopes that did not exist in nature before 1945. (Fission products were produced in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo about 1.7 billion years ago, but these decayed away before the earliest known human painting.) Both climatology and particularly aerosol science, a subfield of atmospheric science, were largely created to answer the question of how far and wide fallout would travel. Similar to radioactive tracers used in hydrology and materials testing, fallout and the neutron activation of nitrogen gas served as a radioactive tracer that was used to measure and then help model global circulations in the atmosphere by following the movements of fallout aerosols.Entangled histories: Climate science and nuclear weapons research After the Van Allen Belts surrounding Earth were discovered about in 1958, James Van Allen suggested that a nuclear detonation would be one way of probing the magnetic phenomenon, data obtained from the August 1958 Project Argus test shots, a high-altitude nuclear explosion investigation, were vital to the early understanding of Earth's magnetosphere. An artist's conception of the NASA reference design for the Project Orion spacecraft powered by nuclear pulse propulsion. Soviet nuclear physicist and Nobel peace prize recipient Andrei Sakharov also proposed the idea that earthquakes could be mitigated and particle accelerators could be made by utilizing nuclear explosions,Viktor Adamsky and Yuri Smirnov. 1994. \\"Moscow's Biggest Bomb: the 50-Megaton Test of October 1961\\" Cold War International History Project Bulletin, Issue 4, Fall 1994 with the latter created by connecting a nuclear explosive device with another of his inventions, the explosively pumped flux compression generator, to accelerate protons to collide with each other to probe their inner workings, an endeavor that is now done at much lower energy levels with non- explosive superconducting magnets in CERN. Sakharov suggested to replace the copper coil in his MK generators by a big superconductor solenoid to magnetically compress and focus underground nuclear explosions into a shaped charge effect. He theorized this could focus 1023 positively charged protons per second on a 1 mm2 surface, then envisaged making two such beams collide in the form of a supercollider. Underground nuclear explosive data from peaceful nuclear explosion test shots have been used to investigate the composition of Earth's mantle, analogous to the exploration geophysics practice of mineral prospecting with chemical explosives in \\"deep seismic sounding\\" reflection seismology. Project A119, proposed in the 1960s, which as Apollo scientist Gary Latham explained, would have been the detonating of a \\"smallish\\" nuclear device on the Moon in order to facilitate research into its geologic make-up. Analogous in concept to the comparatively low yield explosion created by the water prospecting (LCROSS) Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission, which launched in 2009 and released the \\"Centaur\\" kinetic energy impactor, an impactor with a mass of 2,305 kg (5,081 lb), and an impact velocity of about , releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ). A nuclear shaped charge design that was to provide nuclear pulse propulsion to the Project Orion vehicle. Propulsion use The first preliminary examination of the effects of nuclear detonations upon various metal and non-metal materials, occurred in 1955 with Operation Teapot, were a chain of approximately basketball sized spheres of material, were arrayed at fixed aerial distances, descending from the shot tower.Declassified video 0800017 - Operation Teapot, Military Effects Studies - 1954. circa 19 mins In what was then a surprising experimental observation, all but the spheres directly within the shot tower survived, with the greatest ablation noted on the aluminum sphere located 60 feet from the detonation point, with slightly over 1 inch of surface material absent upon recovery. These spheres are often referred to as \\"Lew Allen's balls\\", after the project manager during the experiments.Project Orion: the true story of the atomic spaceship 2002 The ablation data collected for various materials and the distances the spheres were propelled, serve as the bedrock for the nuclear pulse propulsion study, Project Orion. The direct use of nuclear explosives, by using the impact of ablated propellant plasma from a nuclear shaped charge acting on the rear pusher plate of a ship, was and continues to be seriously studied as a potential propulsion mechanism. Although likely never achieving orbit due to aerodynamic drag, the first macroscopic object to obtain Earth orbital velocity was a \\"900kg manhole cover\\" propelled by the somewhat focused detonation of test shot Pascal-B in August 1957. The use of a subterranean shaft and nuclear device to propel an object to escape velocity has since been termed a \\"thunder well\\". The bright spikes extending below the initial fireball of one of 1952's Operation Tumbler‚ÄìSnapper test shots, are known as the \\"rope trick effect\\". They are caused by the intense flash of X-rays released by the explosion heating the tower holding guy-wires white hot. Project Excalibur intended to focus these x-rays to allow attacks over long distances. In the 1970s Edward Teller, in the United States, popularized the concept of using a nuclear detonation to power an explosively pumped soft X-ray laser as a component of a ballistic missile defense shield known as Project Excalibur. This created dozens of highly focused X-ray beams that would cause the missile to break up due to laser ablation. Laser ablation is one of the damage mechanisms of a laser weapon, but it is also one of the researched methods behind pulsed laser propulsion intended for spacecraft, though usually powered by means of conventionally pumped, laser arrays. For example, ground flight testing by Professor Leik Myrabo, using a non-nuclear, conventionally powered pulsed laser test-bed, successfully lifted a lightcraft 72 meters in altitude by a method similar to ablative laser propulsion in 2000. A powerful solar system based soft X-ray, to ultraviolet, laser system has been calculated to be capable of propelling an interstellar spacecraft, by the light sail principle, to 11% of the speed of light. In 1972 it was also calculated that a 1 Terawatt, 1-km diameter x-ray laser with 1 angstrom wavelength impinging on a 1-km diameter sail, could propel a spacecraft to Alpha Centauri in 10 years.

The 1994 Comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 impacts on planet Jupiter, the Tunguska and Chelyabinsk asteroid‚ÄìEarth collisions of 1908 and 2013 respectively, have served as an impetus for the analysis of technologies that could prevent the destruction of human life by impact events. Asteroid impact avoidance A proposed means of averting an asteroid impacting with Earth, assuming short lead times between detection and Earth impact, is to detonate one, or a series, of nuclear explosive devices, on, in, or in a stand-off proximity orientation with the asteroid, with the latter method occurring far enough away from the incoming threat to prevent the potential fracturing of the near- Earth object, but still close enough to generate a high thrust laser ablation effect. A 2007 NASA analysis of impact avoidance strategies using various technologies stated: > Nuclear stand-off explosions are assessed to be 10‚Äì100 times more effective > than the non-nuclear alternatives analyzed in this study. Other techniques > involving the surface or subsurface use of nuclear explosives may be more > efficient, but they run an increased risk of fracturing the target near- > Earth object. They also carry higher development and operations risks.

It was set in the year 8162. Dragon's Claws first appeared in Dragon's Claws #1 (June 1988), and were created by Simon Furman and Geoff Senior. Prior to their career as law enforcers, the Claws had been \\"the greatest Game players in the world\\" - the Game was a violent team sport, immensely popular and funded by the governing World Development Council, who had used it to distract the population and reduce civil unrest. Many of the villains appearing in the series also have their roots in the Game. Publication history The regular series began in June 1988, intended as the flagship title for a line of American-format, monthly comics from Marvel UK. It was written by Simon Furman and drawn by Geoff Senior, Furman's first choice for artist and a collaborator on Marvel UK's Transformers. Original marketing for the comic in other Marvel UK comics called the team and comic Dragon's Teeth, but an independent comic already had the title. Shots of the cover to the first issue reflected this. The series was promoted with the tagline \\"Earth, 8162. Not a nice place to live...\\" The UK market was never big enough to support the series, which was cancelled due to low sales at #10. It was exported to America in limited numbers. Furman has said one reason for the failure was the size of the comic: the US monthly format was smaller than the standard A4 size of UK comics, meaning newsagents weren't sure where to place it and it was \\"lost\\" when placed with the A4 comics. The comic was also \\"quite explicitly brutal... boys love that kind of stuff\\", but this meant that it was quite likely \\"the parents of Transformers and Thundercats readers drew the line at Dragon‚Äôs Claws.‚Äù Starburst retrospective interview with Furman Furman has said that the behind- the-scenes politics and sports-as-panacea plot of Rollerball, the costumed gangs of The Warriors, and the future dystopias of 2000 AD all had a strong influence on Claws, and \\"even the NURSE/Matron thing is an affectionate nod to Hattie Jacques and the Carry On movies I grew up with.\\" Live Aid had a mark too, leaving \\"so the concept of starvation on a global scale... indelibly printed on my brain.\\" Plot The story took place in 8162, and followed a team of former game players, the Claws, led by Dragon. The exact nature of the game is only hinted at, but it basically involves team members trying to get to a certain part of various ruined cityscapes, with the opposing team members trying absolutely anything to stop them. It was used as an opiate for the masses, to ease unrest about global concerns as the Earth moves closer to the sun. At the start of the series, the game has been banned for the levels of violence involved, but Dragon, one of the most successful players, is having trouble adapting to civilian life with his wife, Tanya, who he lives with on a farm. He is contacted by Deller, an agent of N.U.R.S.E [National Union of Retired Sports Experts], who offers him, and his old team, the Claws, a role as government enforcers. Dragon initially declines, but when the farm is attacked by another former team, The Wildcats, he changes his mind. Unknown to him, the Wildcats has been hired by Deller for this purpose. A sub-plot dealt with the brother of a deceased Wildcat seeking vengeance against Deller, which resulted in Dragon's family being kidnapped when they were mistaken for Deller's family. Dragon is reunited with the other Claws ‚Äì Mercy (an ex- vigilante), Steel (a samurai honour-bound to Dragon since the latter saved his life in the Tokyo Riots of 8156), Digit (who had a computerised brain) and Scavenger (to quote, \\"No-one quite knows who or what Scavenger really is...\\"), and they are given a brief to stop the many former game teams who are causing trouble. Among these were The Vanishing Ladies, Split Infinity and the Jones Boys, but the recurring threat was the Evil Dead, led by Dragon's old nemesis Slaughterhouse. Other adversaries were the mechanoid freelance peace-keeping agent Death's Head, who was hired by the surviving members of the Evil Dead, and was heavily damaged when he clashed with Dragon, leading to his redesign and leading into the launch of his own title, and a future take on the vigilante Scourge. The main plotline concerns N.U.R.S.E's manipulation of the Claws, who were revealed to be involved in corrupt dealings and had actually reformed the Claws as \\"bully-boys\\" to take out and intimidate any gang that challenged N.U.R.S.E.. They deliberately kept Dragon from his family so he won't question his orders, eventually sending Deller to kill Dragon's wife; he was unable to do it, but his presence led to the family being abducted by another rogue Game team (who believed they were Deller's family and who had a grudge against him). Dragon eventually teamed up with Slaughterhouse and Deller in overcoming N.U.R.S.E's corrupt kingpin Matron in #9. With N.U.R.S.E. closed down and the Claws directly under the control of the World Development Council, Dragon elects to stay on leading the Claws, with Deller now as part of the team. The final issue, #10, left several plot threads dangling. Dragon is still unaware of much of Deller's part in the N.U.R.S.E. conspiracy (or that Deller has murdered a villain who knew the truth), while the fate of his wife, Tanya, last seen in a burning building, is unknown. For the 2004 edition of the charity project Just One Page, Furman and artist Paul Ridgon created an epilogue/teaser for Dragon's Claws, which was later recoloured and reprinted in the 2008 trade paperback. It featured Dragon holding a defeated Slaughterhouse at gunpoint, after a battle where Slaughterhouse was responsible for leading an army in sacking whole cities and killed two of the Claws. Dragon debated whether or not to simply kill his nemesis and end the conflict forever, or \\"play it by the book one last time\\" and live up to what the Claws are meant to represent. It was not revealed what decision he took. Characters The members of Dragon's Claws are: *Dragon, team leader - raised in an orphanage and showing great athletic and combat promise, Dragon was drawn to the Game. A tragedy involving his first team, the Courtland Rangers, caused Dragon to quit and led ex-mercenaries in war-torn Sudan. Injured and subsequently rehabilitated, he returned to the Game to form his own team, Dragon's Claws. The team were top of the league within six years, before they quit in 8156, due to escalating violence in the Game. He has a wife Tanya and an adopted son Michael, although his family are estranged as a consequence of Dragon's return to the Claws.\\"N.U.R.S.E.

Denman strongly challenged modern materialism and prejudice by exemplifying and teaching a simple life, and by personally relating to all people, regardless of race, gender, or economic means. His personal property was very limited; for example he usually had only one pair of shoes and refused to wear a watch, preferring to ask for the time as a way of starting a conversation. Articles that were given to him were generally given away to the needy. He was a close friend of another well-known evangelist, Billy Graham who called Denman \\"one of the great mentors for evangelism.\\"Prophetic Evangelist : The living legacy of Harry Denman foreword by Billy Graham He was born September 26, 1893 in Birmingham, Alabama of Hattie Leonard and William Harry Denman, who immigrated from Gloucestershire, England. He earned a bachelor's degree from Birmingham-Southern College in 1921, and a master's degree in social work in 1930. In 1936 he received an honorary doctorate from Athens State University in Alabama. In 1915, Denman became secretary of the Birmingham Sunday School Association, a post which he held until 1919, when he became church manager of the First Methodist Church in Birmingham. In 1938 he was elected secretary for the Department of Evangelism in the Board of Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Then, in 1939, he became the General Secretary of the Commission on Evangelism, later known as the General Board of Evangelism, of the newly formed The Methodist Church.In 1939, the northern and southern factions of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Protestant Church merged to form The Methodist Church As the general secretary, he also had responsibility for the publication of The Upper Room, a devotional publication. He was also a member of the Jurisdictional Conferences in 1940, 1944, 1948, and 1952. On January 31, 1949, Denman was among a group of nine dedicated Methodists whose desire to directly support evangelism ministry in the church led them to incorporate The Foundation for Evangelism. Denman was also instrumental in establishing the International Prayer Fellowship. This organization was headquartered in Lake Junaluska, North Carolina where a prayer chapel dedicated to Denman still exists in the historic Lambuth Inn. In 1965, Denman retired from The General Board of Evangelism. He accepted his final salary from the General Board and donated it to The Foundation for Evangelism. He then traveled extensively in the United States and throughout the world to preach and conduct evangelistic meetings. He died November 8, 1976 in Birmingham, Alabama at the age of 83.

Owing to its position on the high roads of commerce was an important trading post. The site was successively occupied by Hittites, Cimmerians, Persians, Celts, Greeks, Romans, Seljuk Turks and Ottoman Turks. At the time of the Roman Empire, Tavium was an important crossroads and a stopping place on the caravan routes. One of the few things known about Tavium is that there was metalworking, because coins have been found that were minted there in the early 1st century bearing the likenesses of Marcus Aurelius and Elagabalus. Copper, tin, iron and silver were mined in the nearby mountains. Similar to other Celtic towns of the time, the smelting and stamping was done by a small group of artisans working in one or two stone huts. In the city there was a colossal statue of Zeus in bronze,Strabo, Geography, ¬ß12.5.2 greatly venerated by the Galatians. There was some doubt about the exact site of the city, but it is today generally believed to be the ruins situated close to the village of Nefezk√∂y (today known as B√ºy√ºknefes), lying in a very fertile plain east of the Halys in the province of Yozgat. These ruins were partly used in building the neighbouring town of Yozgat, where there exist the remains of a theatre and possibly of a temple of Jupiter; these have a number of inscriptions, mostly Byzantine. In the Notiti√¶ Episcopatuum the bishopric of Tavium is mentioned up to the 13th century as the first suffragan of Ancyra. The names of five bishops of the area are known: Dicasius, present at the Councils of Neoc√¶sarea and Nice; Julian, at the second Council of Ephesus (449), and at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and a signer of the letter from the Galatian bishops to the Emperor Leo (458); Anastasius, present at the second Council of Constantinople (553); Gregory at the Council in Trullo (692); Philaretus at Constantinople (869). As of the early 20th century, B√ºy√ºknefes was inhabited during the winter by nomadic Turkish tribes. It was then in the kaza (district) of Sungurlu and the vilayet of Ankara.

The music was written by David Mann; the lyrics, by Bob Hilliard. The song was published in 1950. The song is about reminiscences, and often sung as a duet. When done as a duet, each one of the singers asks the other whether he or she remembers a number of long-ago events, and then says \\"if you remember, you're much older than I.\\" When sung as a solo, the same questions are directed at the audience.

The Congreso de laS LenguaS (Spanish, Congress of the Languages) was a cultural event that took place in Rosario, Argentina, from 15 November to 20 November 2004. It was a series of meetings and lectures devoted to the discussion of cultural and linguistic diversity in Latin America, intended initially as indirect criticism and counter-event for the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language which was being celebrated at about the same time. It was presided over by the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel. The very name of the Congreso attempted to emphasize the plurality of traditions of the region, over the de facto dominant status of Spanish brought about by the colonization and the ensuing decimation of the indigenous languages of the Americas. It is due to this emphasis that the S marking the plural in the article las \\"the\\" and the noun lenguas \\"tongues, languages\\" is in uppercase. Rodolfo Hach√©n, a professor of ethnolinguistics at the National University of Rosario and one of the organizers, stated that they objected the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language because it was intended to affirm the appropriation of Spanish by the Association of Spanish Language Academies, which officially regulates the language. Hach√©n countered that the only \\"owners\\" of a language are its speakers. The organizers of the Third Congress pointed out that such criticism are out of date, since the Association of Spanish Language Academies has revised its policies on the acceptance of linguistic innovation and variants.

Along with Underground Resistance and Planet E, Plus 8 was one of the early producers of Detroit Techno's 'Second Wave' music at the start of the 1990s. History Plus 8 was founded in 1990 by DJs Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva. The label's name referred to the fact that on most turntables, +8% is the maximum amount by which one can increase the speed of playback. Initial releases were a series of increasingly faster industrial hardcore recordings by the pair themselves and their friends, using aliases such as States of Mind and Cybersonik, along with other Detroit-based musicians such as Kenny Larkin. The label began to retreat from hard and fast tempo after the release of Circuit Breaker's \\"Overkill/Frenz-E\\" and Cybersonik's \\"Thrash\\" in 1992. Hawtin and Aquaviva lost interest in the drug- fueled dynamic and rave culture that was driving hardcore techno. In 1992, after observing a crowd in a Rotterdam club shouting an anti-semitic football chant over Plus 8's song, Cybersonik's \\"Thrash\\", Hawtin and Aquaviva decided to change musical direction by slowing down the tempo and bringing funk and soul back into their music. Plus 8 releases include early 12-inch singles from Speedy J, and from Richie Hawtin's many pseudonyms including F.U.S.E. and Plastikman. By 1996 Plus 8 had also released a number of dance compilation albums. The label was suspended in 1997, as Acquaviva concentrated on DJing and Hawtin on his new label, M_nus, but releases (and re-releases of early material often licensed to other labels) have appeared from time to time, notably 2000's Plus 8 Classics triple 12-inch vinyl and CD retrospective.

Kieft went into punditry in 2001, occasionally appearing in football talk show Voetbal Inside A prolific goal-scorer whose main asset was his heading ability, he played in his country for two of the most important clubs, Ajax and PSV. He also played abroad in Italy and France. Kieft played for the Dutch national team, and was a member of the squad that won Euro 1988. He also represented the nation at the 1990 World Cup. Club career Kieft in 1981 Born in Amsterdam, Kieft started his professional career with local AFC Ajax, making his first-team debuts on 4 May 1980 at not yet 18. Amongst his youth teammates were Frank Rijkaard, John van 't Schip, Marco van Basten and Gerald Vanenburg, as in his first two full seasons he scored at an astonishing rate, especially in 1981‚Äì82 when he netted 32 goals in as many games, being crucial as the team lifted the Eredivisie title and receiving the European Golden Boot award. At only 20, Kieft was sold to Italy's Pisa Calcio, scoring only three times in a relegation-ending campaign. He did help the Tuscany side immediately promote to Serie A, but underperformed overall in the top flight, with that club and his following, Torino FC. In the summer of 1987, Kieft returned to his country and signed for PSV Eindhoven. His impact was immediate as his new team won the treble, including the season's European Cup where he scored in the penalty shootout defeat of S.L. Benfica (0‚Äì0 after 120 minutes). En route to these accolades he contributed with more than 30 goals overall, 29 alone in the league, a competition-best; he was also one of five European players to ever achieve the feat of winning four competitions ‚Äì three with their club and one with the national team ‚Äì in the same year, the others being teammates Berry van Aerle, Hans van Breukelen, Ronald Koeman and Vanenburg. Kieft had his second and last abroad experience in 1990, joining FC Girondins de Bordeaux from France and again underachieving, returning to PSV and playing three more seasons until his retirement, averaging more than 11 goals in his second spell with the latter. In total, he scored 158 times in only 264 matches in the Netherlands' top division. Kieft rejoined PSV in 2009, being named assistant coach of the club's youth sides. International career Kieft earned his first cap for the Netherlands in 1981. He would represent the national team in three major international tournaments, UEFA Euro 1988, the 1990 FIFA World Cup and Euro 1992.Wim Kieft ‚Äì International Appearances; at RSSSF In the first competition, Kieft played three times for the eventual champions, always as a second-half substitute: on 18 June 1988, after having replaced Erwin Koeman, he scored in the 82nd minute of the 1‚Äì0 group stage win against the Republic of Ireland, through a header, helping the Dutch overtake their opponents in the match and finish second in Group 2 to secure a place in the semi-finals. Kieft played four times in the second tournament, held in Italy, starting against a familiar opponent, Ireland, and finding the net in the 1‚Äì1 draw against Egypt as the Oranje exited in the round-of-16. Post-retirement career and personal life After retiring, Kieft worked as a football pundit for television channels Sport1 and RTL, making a name for himself as a commentator and pundit with popular football talkshow Voetbal Inside (VI). In 2016, Kieft signed an exclusive agreement with Ziggo Sport. Because of this, he initially could not feature at the VI table. At the end of 2018, Kieft returned twice a week as a table guest at VI. In 2019, Kieft signed a three- year contract with Talpa, which meant that he returned to their new program, Veronica Inside, with the same concept as VI. His son, Robbin (born 1987), was also a footballer. After attending Ajax and FC Groningen's youth academies, he played exclusively in the lower leagues of his country. In his biography, published in 2014, Kieft admitted his long-lasting addiction of alcohol and cocaine, which began after the end of his career and ended after a withdrawal treatment.

It is headquartered in the Kiba area of Koto, Tokyo. The main operating entities of the group are Resona Bank, a nationwide corporate and retail bank headquartered in Osaka, and Saitama Resona Bank, a smaller bank headquartered in Saitama City which primarily serves Saitama Prefecture. Most of these banks' operations are descended from Daiwa Bank and Asahi Bank, which merged in 2003. History =Daiwa Bank= Resona was formed as the Osaka Nomura Bank in 1918. This entity served as the financing arm of the Nomura zaibatsu founded by Tokushichi Nomura. Its securities brokerage operation separated in 1926 to form Nomura Securities, now Japan's largest securities company. The bank was renamed Nomura Bank in 1927 and became the main bank for the Osaka Prefecture government in 1929, immediately following the 1929 stock market crash. The Nomura zaibatsu was dissolved in the wake of World War II, and the bank was renamed to The Daiwa Bank in 1948. It was one of the only major banks that offered both banking and trust services during the postwar era. In 1995, a New York-based Daiwa bond trader, Toshihide Iguchi, lost $1.1 billion speculating in the bond market and was charged with forgery and falsification of bank records. The bank was criminally indicted in November 1995 and ordered to leave the U.S. market; in the wake of this incident, there were talks of a merger between Daiwa and Sumitomo Bank, which would have created the world's largest bank at the time. Daiwa closed its United States operations in 1996, and eventually pulled out of overseas banking entirely in 1998. =Asahi Bank= was formed by a 9-bank merger in May 1945 to consolidate various savings banks that served Japanese individuals around the end of World War II. During the immediate postwar era, rapid inflation threatened the bank's business. In 1948, it was converted to an ordinary bank named . Kyowa merged with in 1991 to form , renamed in 1992. Asahi entered into merger talks with Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank, and the three banks announced a merger in 2001. The merger would have created the third- largest bank in the world behind Deutsche Bank and Mizuho Financial Group. However, Asahi pulled out of these talks later that year. The eventual Sanwa- Tokai merger formed UFJ Bank. =Resona merger= Daiwa formed a bank holding company, Daiwa Bank Holdings, in December 2001 to serve as the parent entity of Daiwa, Kinki Osaka Bank and Nara Bank. Later that month, Daiwa announced that Asahi Bank would be acquired by Daiwa Bank Holdings in a share swap transaction, forming the fifth-largest banking group in Japan. The company was renamed Resona Holdings, Inc. on 1 October 2002. Daiwa and Asahi consolidated operations on 1 March 2003, with most of their assets combined to form Resona Bank. 100 Asahi Bank branches in Saitama and three branches in Tokyo were moved to a separate entity, Saitama Resona Bank. =Post-merger developments= In early 2003 the Resona Group's capital adequacy ratio fell dangerously low. The bank had proposed to maintain its capital adequacy ratio above the legal limit by factoring in deferred tax assets. However, the value of these deferred assets could only be claimed if the company turned a profit in the future. Because the bank's profit outlook was so dim, Resona's auditor refused to certify the company's financial statement if the deferred tax assets were included. Without being able to count the deferred tax assets, the bank was effectively insolvent. The Resona case threatened to cripple the entire country's financial system, since the other major banks were also counting on deferred tax assets to maintain their capital adequacy ratios. On 17 May 2003, the Japan government decided to inject 1.96 trillion yen in public funds into the Resona Group through Resona Bank.Receipt of Subscription Payments for New Common and Preferred Shares(Capital Increase with Public Funds), Resona press release, 30 June 2003. This move, through the share exchange agreement between the bank and the holding company, effectively nationalized the bank, since the government emerged as the company's majority shareholder, holding 68.25% of voting rights of the holding company, Announcement Regarding Change in Principal Shareholder of Resona Holdings,Inc Resona Holdings press release, 7 August 2003. while the holdings of existing shareholders were greatly diluted. The existing management was sacked and a new management was installed. Former Resona Chairman Eiji Hosoya is credited with leading the bank's revival following the 2003 bailout. Hosoya initially resisted taking the appointment to head Resona, saying in a news conference held on 30 May 2003, \\"I decided to accept the offer as I realized that stabilizing the financial system is the highest priority for the Japanese economy.\\" Under Hosoya, the bank's new management immediately set about to reduce Resona's non-performing loans (NPLs). In 2004, the company managed to turn a profit of Ôø•386 billion. As a result, Resona's management announced a plan to, over the next 10 years, return to the government Ôø•868 billion of the Ôø•3 trillion in public funds it has received. Hosoya died in November 2012. Resona introduced two new full-time employee career tracks in 2015: one \\"no overtime\\" track for employees seeking better work-life balance, and another track for employees who wish to remain in a single position for their entire career. These policies were unique among Japanese banks at the time of their introduction.

Founded in Vienna by Scandinavian, German and Austrian students in 1961, it represents over 1.600.000 students and young people in 40 member organisations from 35 countries in Europe, and is the largest youth organisation in Europe. Its stated goal is to promote a free, democratic and united Europe through a greater student mobility and comprehensive education policies across the continent. European Democrat Students has been always a frontrunner in integration, fighting for open borders, united Europe and European debate in European politics. The three pillars of EDS originally stood for conservatism, liberalism and christian democracy. Today, EDS grew into a large family which has an outlook that is various, rich and unique, represented by the name 'Democrat': Here, student organisations, political youth organisations and other centre-right organisations come together to shape modern centre-right policies for Europe. History In 1958, a group of Swedish students, members of the Conservative Student League of Sweden, travelled to Vienna, Prague and West Berlin, where they attended the annual meeting of the Association of Christian Democratic Students. A cooperation between the Swedish and West German students was initiated, that was soon extended to include student organisations from the rest of Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. In response to increasing activities of communist organisations, the liberal-conservative and christian democratic student organisations from these countries saw a need for stronger international cooperation among democratic student organisations in Europe. When the communist International Union of Students organised the \\"7th World Youth Festival\\" in Vienna in 1959, christian democratic and liberal- conservative students established the organisation Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben (Action Committee New Life), the first international organisation of centre-right students in Europe. The new organisation distributed pins with the text \\"Remember Hungary 1956!\\" Carl Bildt proposed the current name of the organisation in 1975 The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben quickly evolved into the International Student Conferences, that took place in Copenhagen and Stockholm for the first time in 1960. At the third conference, in Vienna in 1961, the International of Christian-Democrat and Conservative Students, the predecessor of the European Democrat Students, was founded. The organisation considered itself to be the \\"first avantgarde fighter for the protection of the principles of liberty and individualism,\\" and supported European integration and programmes for student mobility. The founding member organisations were the Freie √ñsterreichische Studentenschaft (Austria), the Conservative Students (Denmark), the Association of Christian Democratic Students (West Germany), the Students' League of the Conservative Party (Norway), and the Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students (FMSF). A few months later, the Federation of University Conservative and Unionist Associations (UK) and ESC (Belgium) joined. The current name of the organisation, European Democrat Students, was adopted in 1975, after it was proposed by Carl Bildt. Since 1997, EDS has been the official student organisation of the European People's Party (EPP). Full members status is held to the European Youth Forum (YFJ), the International Young Democrat Union (IYDU) and the Robert Schuman Institute. EDS is also recognised as a member association of the European Peoples Party (EPP), where EDS is one of the six EPP associations - in addition to recognition as an NGO at the Council of Europe. Organising seminars, summer and winter universities, publications, campaigns and political resolutions, EDS connects like-minded students from all over the continent and shapes European student policies as well as the debates within the EPP. In 2011, the celebrations of the 50th anniversary have been conducted in Brussels and Vienna, attracting several hundreds of members, alumni, politicians and partners. An important shift towards a more wide vision of the world was introduced during the working year 2017-2018 with the first Study Mission organized in Latin America under the title of \\"Caja Pol√≠tica\\". A second edition was held in 2019 in Guayaquil and Quito (Ecuador) and it successfully gathered young leaders from a dozen Latin American countries with representatives of the EDS Bureau and Member Organizations. After these events EDS became a pioneer in the center right becoming the first European organization regularly active in Latin America, Europe and Middle East.

An opto-electronical colour measurement device is used to measure pallor mortis on bodies. Timing and applicability Pallor mortis occurs almost immediately, generally within 15‚Äì25 minutes, after death. Paleness develops so rapidly after death that it has little to no use in determining the time of death, aside from saying that it either happened less than 30 minutes ago or more, which could help if the body were found very soon after death. Cause Pallor mortis results from the collapse of capillary circulation throughout the body. Gravity then causes the blood to sink down into the lower parts of the body, creating livor mortis. Similar paleness in living persons A living person can look deathly pale. This can happen when blood escapes from the surface of the skin, in a matter of deep shock. Also heart failure (insufficientia cordis) can make the face look paled; the person then might have blue lips. Skin can also look deathly pale as a result of vasoconstriction as part of the body's homeostatic systems in cold conditions, or if the skin is deficient in vitamin D, as seen in people who spend most of the time indoors, away from sunlight.

GUST is affiliated with the National Student Television Association (NaSTA) and broadcasts a wide range of programmes, including creative and factual as well as annual Freshers‚Äô Week coverage. It is one of the four mediums of student media at the University of Glasgow, along with the Glasgow Guardian, Glasgow University Magazine and Subcity Radio.  History  = Founding = During interviews with current staff of the Media Production Unit at Glasgow University, it was revealed that the University's Television Service began operating in 1963. However, it is believed that Glasgow University Student Television (GUST) was founded in 1964. It is unclear when the name GUST was actually created, but it began being commonly used in the 1970s. This means that GUST was the first student television station to be founded in the United Kingdom, and also the oldest student television station in Europe. There is a station in the United States that was founded before GUST, but this station was staff run for students. Thus, GUST is the oldest student-run television station in the world. Content being produced during a weekly GUST studio at Southpark House, Glasgow Between 1966-68, Glasgow University built a television studio in the basement of Southpark House in order to support teaching facilities. It was hoped that this new facility would be used for a student operated TV service made by students. This marked the beginning of GUST as a broadcasting station. To this day, GUST hold their weekly studios in these facilities to create videos. = 1960s-1990s = GUST would originally broadcast a weekly live programme on a Friday lunchtime, cleverly titled ‚ÄúLunchtime Friday,‚Äù which would run for about an hour and would be shown at 12:10pm and repeated at 1:10pm every Friday during term time. This content would be broadcast on the University's cable network so GUST programmes would reach every building on campus, and also many others outside the university. That then means GUST was broadcasting on the biggest cable network in Europe at the time. GUST was a founding member of the National Student Television Association (NaSTA), helping establish the first awards ceremony in 1973. Notable past GUSTies include Steven Moffat and Andrew Neil, both of whom were members of the station during their time at the University of Glasgow. = Present day = GUST is shown on television screens around campus but also broadcasts their programming on their own website, gust.tv, which it has done since 2005. Alongside ongoing coverage of student life and goings-on in Glasgow as a whole, they cover Freshers' Week every year, including events organised by the Students' Representative Council, Glasgow University Union, Glasgow University Sports Association and Queen Margaret Union. Notably, GUST produces a Freshers' Guide each year that is streamed at the Freshers' Address given on the Monday of Freshers' Week. In 2014, the university's production studio at Southpark House was upgraded to a full HD studio. GUST produces a variety of programmes, ranging from interviews with musicians and documentaries on cosplay and mental health, as well as much more. Some recent GUST series include Miscellanea, Surround Sound Live, Creative Conflict and Experimental Shorts.  Structure  GUST is managed by an executive team named the Top 4, composed of the Controller (the head of the station), Head of Creative Programming, Head of Factual Programming and Head of Technical. Unlike most British student television stations, the station chose to keep the name \\"Controller\\" as opposed to \\"Station Manager\\" to reflect the historical name for that position at the BBC. Producers, coordinators and convenors fall under the supervision of one of the members of the Top 4. There are four Creative producerships (Arts, Comedy/Drama, Music and Lifestyle), four Factual producerships (Clubs/Societies, News, Science and Sports), three technical positions (Assistant Technical Coordinator, Webmaster and Animation Producer) and three organisational positions (Social Convenor, Broadcast/Publicity Coordinator and Fundraising Convenor). Whilst producers focus on the creation of content, the various coordinators and convenors assist with the general functioning of the station.  Awards  Along with the many NaSTA awards that GUST has been able to obtain over the years, there are also many other awards that GUST have been fortunate enough to receive. In 1977 and 1978, GUST won Best Float in the Charity's float competition. Their prize was a barrel of beer and GUST came out and apologised if this prize affected their video quality in any way. In 1995, GUST were awarded 'The Stanley's: The Next Big Thing' in the Student category by the Royal Television Society. In 1998, two of GUST's videos were selected to be screened at the University of Glasgow International Student Film and Video Festival. These programmes were the Best of G-Spot and Best of GUST. In 2016, GUST won Most Dedicated Member: Sarah Battensby (GUST) in Volunteering, Clubs and Societies Awards at the University of Glasgow. At the most recent edition of the NaSTA awards (2019, Nottingham), GUST won Best Documentary & Factual. In 2018 (Sheffield) they received three Highly Commended awards for Best Writing, Best On-Screen Talent and Best Freshers' Coverage, and in 2017 (Birmingham) they won Best Male and Best Ident as well as received two Highly Commended awards for Best Open and Best Station Marketing.

Senior is perhaps best remembered for his art for the Marvel Transformers series. Biography Senior debuted on the British title drawing #42, and became one of the title's most prolific and popular artists (always inking his own pencils), thanks to his geometric style, which perfectly suited the dynamics of the series. He worked on a number of other titles for Marvel UK, including Doctor Who Magazine (1988), Dragon's Claws (which he co-created with Simon Furman, and drew all ten issues of), Death's Head (another character he helped create, initially as a guest star for Transformers) and Action Force Weekly, as well as several Marvel UK annuals. He followed Furman across to Marvel USA in 1989, drawing Transformers US #61, and four more issues before the title's cancellation, including the classic #75. He drew several other titles in the early 1990s, including Hell's Angel (later renamed as Dark Angel) and several issues of What If...?, as well as returning to Transformers for the final few issues of Transformers Generation 2. Since then, Senior has largely worked in advertising, though he has returned to Transformers on occasion, for the 1997 BotCon convention comic Reaching the Omega Point, two illustrations for the Transforce convention book Alignment, several covers for Titan Publishing's series of Transformers trade paperbacks, and the cover of issue 1 for Panini's 2003 UK title Transformers Armada. The Senior/Furman team returned for the first issue of Titan Comics' (UK) Transformers in August 2007, in which Senior produced the art for a new story based on the live-action movie characters and events (subsequently reprinted by IDW Publishing in the US). From 2012 to 2014, Senior provided retailer-incentive variant covers for IDW's Transformers: Regeneration One comics, which continued the Marvel U.S. Transformers series, and was a contributing interior artist to Regeneration One #0. In 2019 Senior and Simon Furman started their own company, Forged by Fire Productions, for the purpose of publishing their own comic, To the Death.

Schools within the system are governed by a multitude of entities, including the Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB), which directly administers 6 schools and has granted charters to another 18, and the Recovery School District of Louisiana (RSD), which no longer directly administers any schools within Orleans Parish. Instead, all schools operating under the RSD umbrella within Orleans Parish are, as of the fall of 2014, publicly funded and privately operated charter schools.New Orleans District Moves To An All-Charter System. https://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/05/30/317374739/new-orleans-district-moves- to-an-all-charter-system Though the Orleans Parish School Board has retained ownership of all the assets of the New Orleans Public Schools system, including all school buildings, approximately 93% of students attending publicly-funded schools in Orleans Parish now attend charter schools ‚Äì the highest percentage in the nation.RSD looks at making charters pay rent, The Times-Picayune, December 18, 2009. The headquarters of the OPSB is in the West Bank neighborhood of Algiers, while the RSD's New Orleans office is on Poydras Street in the CBD.\\"Central Office Staff .\\" New Orleans Public Schools. Retrieved on December 15, 2009. History Previously the public school system had separate schools for black and white students. In 1960 the schools began to be racially integrated. Katy Reckdahl of The Times Picayune wrote that at the time, \\"outside observers expressed shock that desegregation provoked such strife in heterogeneous, easy-going New Orleans.\\" =Reorganization of school system following Hurricane Katrina= NOPS was wholly controlled by the OPSB before Hurricane Katrina and was the New Orleans area's largest school district before Katrina devastated the city on August 29, 2005, damaging or destroying more than 100 of the district's 128 school buildings. NOPS served approximately 65,000 students pre-Katrina. For decades prior to Hurricane Katrina's landfall, the OPSB-administered system was widely recognized as the lowest performing school district in Louisiana. According to researchers Carl L. Bankston and Stephen J. Caldas, only 12 of the 103 public schools then in operation within the city limits of New Orleans showed reasonably good performance at the beginning of the 21st century. In Katrina's immediate aftermath, an overwhelmed Orleans Parish School Board asserted that the school system would remain closed indefinitely. The Louisiana Legislature took advantage of this abdication of local leadership and acted swiftly. As a result of legislation passed by the state in November 2005, 102 of the city's worst-performing public schools were transferred to the Recovery School District (RSD), which is operated by the Louisiana Department of Education and was headed for a key period (2008-2011) by noted education leader Paul Vallas. The Recovery School District had been created in 2003 to allow the state to take over failing schools, those that fell into a certain \\"worst-performing\\" metric. Five public schools in New Orleans had been transferred to RSD control prior to Katrina. The NOPS system was trying to decentralize power away from the pre-Katrina school board central bureaucracy to individual school principals and charter school boards, and allow for school choice, allowing them to enroll their children in almost any school in the district. Charter school accountability is realized by the granting of renewable operating contracts of varying lengths permitting the closure of those not succeeding.Vallas wants no return to old ways, The Times-Picayune, July 25, 2009. In October 2009, the release of annual school performance scores demonstrated continued growth in the academic performance of New Orleans' public schools. By aggregating the scores of all public schools in New Orleans (OPSB-chartered, RSD-chartered, RSD-administered, etc.) to permit a comparison with pre-Katrina outcomes, a district performance score of 70.6 was derived. This score represented a 6% increase over the equivalent 2008 metric, and a 24% improvement when measured against the equivalent pre-Katrina (2004) metric, when a district score of 56.9 was posted.Orleans Parish school performance scores continue to improve, The Times-Picayune, October 14, 2009. Notably, the score of 70.6 approached the score (78.4) posted in 2009 by the adjacent, suburban Jefferson Parish public school system, though that system's performance score was itself below the state average of 91.Jefferson Parish schools make progress, but still have long way to go: an editorial, The Times- Picayune, October 15, 2009. The current RSD superintendent is Patrick Dobard, while the diminished, OPSB portion of NOPS has been led since 2015 by Henderson Lewis. The conversion of the majority of New Orleans' public schools to charter schools following Hurricane Katrina has been cited by author Naomi Klein in her book The Shock Doctrine as an application of economics shock therapy, and of the tactic of taking advantage of public disorientation following a disaster to effect radical change in public policy.Naomi Klein, 2007. The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. =Reunification= According to Senate Bill 432, passed by the Louisiana State Legislature on May 10, 2016 and signed into law by Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards on May 12, 2016, all public schools in New Orleans will return to supervision by OPSB by July 1, 2018.\\"NOLA Schools Unification.\\" Orleans Parish School Board. Retrieved on December 8, 2016. Surveys of public opinion A 2009 survey conducted by Tulane University's Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, which is listed as a \\"Key Partner\\" of New Schools for New Orleans, a charter school advocacy group, indicated that the state's takeover of the majority of NOPS and the subsequent spread of charters was viewed with strong approval, by both parents of students and by citizens in general. Specifically, a poll of 347 randomly selected Orleans Parish voters and 300 randomly selected parents of children in the NOPS system indicated that 85% of parents surveyed reported they were able to enroll their children at the school they preferred, and 84% said the enrollment process was easy - findings that surprised the researchers. Furthermore, 82% of parents with children enrolled at charter schools gave their children's schools an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\", though only 48% of parents of children enrolled in non-chartered public schools assigned A's or B's to the schools their children attended. According to the survey, clear majorities of parents and of voters overall did not want the Orleans Parish School Board to regain full administrative control of the NOPS system.Changes in N.O. schools cheered, The Times-Picayune, December 16, 2009. Curriculum In the mid-1800s the German American community of New Orleans attempted to have the German language supplant French as a subject in school.Merrill, p. 235. The German Society made efforts to have German introduced into the school system.Merrill, p. 236. In 1910 the German language was added to the NOPS curriculum, making it a regular subject in high schools and, at the elementary school, an afternoon elective. At the time, 10% of high school students selected German. In 1918, because of World War I propaganda, German was discontinued. German was re-introduced in 1931. The Deutsches Haus, the successor to the German society, made efforts to reintroduce German. German was discontinued in 1938 as World War II began. Push for desegregation In the late 1950s, Dorothy Mae Taylor, the president of two chapters of the Parent Teacher Association who in 1971 became the first African-American woman to serve in the Louisiana House of Representatives, organized a march to the school board to demand equal resources for black children in public schools. The board eventually acquiesced, and the parish increased funding to historically black schools to a level comparable to their white counterparts. Then came the national push for desegregation, particularly through the federal courts and later in the U.S. Congress with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Racial barriers were dropped, and a new generation of African American leaders won most of the public offices in Orleans Parish. Schools Fifty-three public schools opened in New Orleans for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. This number included schools directly administered by the OPSB or the RSD, or schools chartered by the OPSB or the RSD. By November 2006, the system was approaching half of its pre- Katrina enrollment, with 36% of the students enrolled in independent charter schools, 18% in the Algiers Charter School Association charter network, 35% in schools directly administered by the RSD, and 11% in the few remaining schools directly administered by the OPSB. Within fourteen months of Katrina, the majority of students in the NOPS system were, therefore, attending charter schools, a condition that has persisted to the present and is cited with approval by national advocates of charter schools. For the 2013‚Äì2014 school year, the Orleans Parish School Board directly administered 4 schools and oversaw the 16 it chartered. The RSD directly administered 15 schools and supervised the 60 it chartered. Additionally, two schools were chartered directly by the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE).Recovery School District Frequently Asked Questions. http://www.rsdla.net/Resources/FAQs.aspx For the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, all public schools operating under the RSD umbrella within Orleans Parish are independent charter schools. =OPSB-chartered schools= Benjamin Franklin High School * Audubon Charter School (French Immersion & Montessori) * Benjamin Franklin High School * Edward Hynes Charter School * Encore Academy * Einstein Charter School * Harte Elementary * Edna Karr High School * Lake Forest Elementary Charter * Lusher Charter School (Grades K-12) * New Orleans Charter Science and Mathematics High School * Warren Easton Fundamental High School * Robert Moton Elementary =OPSB-operated schools= * Benjamin Franklin Elementary Mathematics and Science School * Eleanor McMain Secondary Magnet School * Mary Bethune Elementary * McDonogh 35 High School * Mahalia Jackson Elementary =RSD-operated schools= (Outdated: For the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, the RSD directly administers no schools within Orleans Parish.) * A.P.

Phillips on account of the typical development of the phase in Yoredale (now generally known as Wensleydale), Yorkshire. Properties and condition In the Yorkshire dales the Carboniferous rocks assume an aspect very different from that which obtains in the South. Beds of detrital sediment, sandstones, shales and occasional ironstones and thin coals separate the limestones into well-defined beds. These limestone beds have received various names of local significance (Hardraw Scar, Simonstone, Middle, Underset, Main and many others), and owing to the country being little disturbed by faulting and being much cut up by the streams, they stand out as escarpments on either side of the valleys. The first indication of the intercalation of thick detrital deposits within the massive limestone is seen in Ingleborough and Penyghent; but as the rocks are traced north the detrital matter increases in quantity and the limestones diminish, until in Northumberland the whole Carboniferous series assumes the Yoredale phase, and consists of alternations of detrital and calcareous beds, no massive limestone being seen. Citations: * Mem. Geol. Survey, \\"Geology of Mallerstang\\" * W. Hind, Proc. Yorks. Geol. and Poly. Soc. (1902), xiv. part iii. * Rep. Brit. Ass., \\"Life Zones Brit. Carb. Rocks\\" (1901) Fossils The Yoredale limestones are characterized by the presence of Productus giganteus and the brachiopod fauna usually associated with it. The main limestone of Weardale is full of corals, including Lonsdaleia floriformis, Dibunophyllum sp., Cyclophyllum pachyendothecum, etc., and has a typical Visean fauna; it would therefore correspond, palaeontologically, with the upper part of the Carboniferous Limestone of Derbyshire. On Ingleborough the limestone is not very fossiliferous, but the Main Limestone contains small corals of a zaphrentoid type and an upper Visean fauna. Posidonomya Becheri occurs fairly low down in the series in the Shale above the Hardraw Scar and Gayle limestones, but it is not accompanied by any of the goniatites or other cephalopods and lamellibranchs which characterize the Posidonomya Becheri beds of the Pendleside Series, the faunas of the Yoredale and Pendleside phases being very distinct. The Red Bed Limestone of Leyburn, the uppermost limestone of the series, is very rich in fish remains, which are identical in many cases with those found in the topmost beds of the massive Carboniferous Limestone at Bolt Edge quarry in Derbyshire. The shales between the limestones are rich in fossils and contain abundant single corals referable to Zaphrentis enniskilleni, Cyclophyllum pachyendothecum, and others; these, though high- zonal forms, occur low down in the Yoredale strata, even in the shale above the Hardraw Scar limestone. In the Derbyshire area and farther north these corals would indicate the uppermost beds of the limestone series of those districts, and their early appearance in the Yoredale area is probably entirely due to conditions of environment. Attempts have been made to correlate rocks in a number of widely separated areas with the Yoredale strata, but on wholly insufficient grounds. It is clear that the exact relationship which the Yoredale series of the type area bears as a whole to the lower Carboniferous rocks of the Midlands, north and south Wales, etc., on the one hand, and to the Pendleside series on the other, has yet to be established on a firm palaeontological basis.

Announced in 1980, it became, along with the Texas Instruments TMS32010, one of the most popular DSPs of its day. Background In the late 1970s, telephone engineers were attempting to create technology with sufficient performance to enable digital touch-tone dialing. Existing digital signal processing solutions required over a hundred chips and consumed significant amounts of power. Intel responded to this potential market by introducing the Intel 2920, and integrated processor that, while it had both digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, lacked additional features (such as a hardware multiplier) that would be found in later processors. Announcements for the first \\"real\\" DSPs, the NEC ŒºPD7720 and the Bell Labs DSP-1 chip, occurred the following year at the 1980 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits conference. The ŒºPD7720 first became available in 1981 and commercially available in late 1982 at a cost of US$600 each (approx. $ today). Beyond their initial use in telephony, these processors found applications in disk drive and graphics controllers, speech synthesis and modems. Architecture Detailed descriptions of the ŒºPD7720 architecture are found in Chance (1990), Sweitzer (1984) and Simpson (1984). Briefly, the NEC ŒºPD7720 runs at 4 MHz frequency with 128-word data RAM, 512-word data ROM, and 512-word program memory, which has VLIW-like instruction format, enabling all of ALU operation, address register increment/decrement operation, and move operation in one cycle. Variants The successor NEC ŒºPD96050 The NEC ŒºPD77C25, which succeeded the ŒºPD7720, runs at 8 MHz frequency with 256-word data RAM, 1,024-word data ROM, and 2,048-word program memory.

It is similar to the crumhorn in having a windcap over the reed and cylindrical bore. In Syntagma musicum II (1619), Michael Praetorius writes: \\"Die CornaMuse sind gleich aus/und nicht mit doppelten/sondern mit einer einfachen R√∂hre/gleich den Bassanelli\\" (The cornamuse are similar to/and do not have a double, but rather a single tube (bore)/like the bassanelli.) This statement differentiates it from double bore instruments of the period like the sordun, kortholt and curtal. Praetorius did not include a woodcut of the cornamuse, but his depiction of the bassanello has a single bore and double reed. Another clue to its appearance is given in his description of the schryari: (\\"They...are nearly the same as the cornamuse in size and appearance\\".) Assertions by some modern writers about the cornamuse having a single reed stem from the misreading of \\"R√∂hre\\" (pipe, tube, duct, canal) as \\"Rohr\\" (reed). Description of the cornamuse, a Renaissance instrument, by Michael Praetorius Since the paragraph by Praetorius is the only clear description of the cornamuse and no period specimen has been found, all reconstructions of the instrument rely on a certain amount of conjecture.

It comprises a complex of vertically and laterally varying gravels, sands, silts and clays deposited between 56-55 million years before present during the Ypresian age (lower Eocene). It is found throughout the London Basin with a thickness between 10m and 30m and the Hampshire Basin with a thickness between 50m and less than 25m. Although this sequence only crops out in these basins (being in the eminences), the fact that it underlies 25% of London at a depth of less than 30m means the formation is of engineering interest for tunnelling and foundations. History The formation was first known as the Plastic Clay by T. Webster in 1816 after the Argile plastique of Georges Cuvier and A. Brongniart. It was called the Mottled Clay by Joseph Prestwich in 1846, but in 1853 he proposed the name Woolwich-and-Reading Beds to emphasise the differing local aspects of the series. This name received widespread usage, but it was in turn deprecated in 1994 in favour of the Lambeth Group by the British Geological Survey, to conform with new standards and to allow scope for more detailed subdivisions. Subdivision The Lambeth Group consists of three formations: *The Reading Formation: a series of lenticular mottled clays and sands, here and there with pebbly beds and masses of fine sand converted into sandstone. These beds are generally unfossiliferous. They are found in the north of the London Basin, mid-west of the Thames Basin and in the Hampshire Basin. *The Woolwich Formation: grey clays and pale sands, often estuarine shells comprise a great deal, in places including a well-marked oyster bed (strata). It overspills borders of west Kent, is found in edges of east Kent, in south Essex and at Newhaven, Sussex. At the base of the shell-rich clayer lay in southeast London are pebble beds and lignitic layers. *The Upnor Formation: light-coloured false-bedded sands with marine fossils occurs in east Kent. Where it rests on the Thanet beds it is an argillaceous greensand with rounded flint pebbles; where it rests on the chalk it is more clayey and the flints are less rounded and are green-coated. In Dorset the Reading Formation appears on the coast at Studland Bay and at other points inland. The Hertfordshire puddingstone is a distinctive rock from near the base of the formation; a flint pebbly conglomerate in a siliceous matrix. The fossils, estuarine, freshwater and marine, include Corbicula cuneiformis, C. tellinella, Ostrea bellovacina, Viva parus lentus, Planorbis hemistoma, Melania (Melanatria) inquinata, Neritina globulus, and the remains of turtles, crocodiles, sharks, birds (Gastornis) and the mammal Coryphodon. Bricks, tiles and coarse pottery and occasionally firebricks have been made from the clay beds in this formation. Stratigraphic relationship Except in the Hampshire Basin, the Lambeth Group usually rests on the Thanet Formation of the Montrose Group, but is found on the Chalk Group near Bromley, Charlton, Hungerford, Hertford and Reading. It is usually covered by the Harwich Formation, the oldest formation of the Thames Group.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books, and animated series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's First Sergeant, and debuted in 1983. The character is also featured in both the G.I. Joe: Sigma 6 animated series and comic books. Channing Tatum portrays Duke in the 2009 live-action film, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and the 2013 sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Profile Duke is the code name of First Sergeant Conrad S. Hauser, and was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He is a skilled polyglot, being fluent in English, French and German, as well as several Southeast Asian languages. He was at the top of his class at Fort Benning, attended U.S. Army Special Language school, has undergone Special Forces training, and worked with South Vietnamese tribesmen. He was also an instructor in four different Special Forces schools. Despite his accomplishments, he has repeatedly turned down any officer commissions offered to him. He believes a commander's place is with his troops, not behind the battle lines. Duke is field commander and second-in-command of the G.I. Joe team after Hawk. In this role, he has served as a rugged leader by example, a precise giver of orders, a source of history and knowledge, and a fair settler of disputes. As the team has fluctuated in size and structure over the years, Duke has supervised the training of the non-commissioned officers in G.I. Joe, as well as leading special units such as Tiger Force and Star Brigade. After the G.I. Joe Team disbanded, Duke disappeared. It was later learned that he had been performing Black Ops for a secret government agency, his missions of which are still highly classified. One such mission was to locate and detain the mercenary Major Bludd, which led to evidence that Cobra Commander had returned, and hastened the reinstatement of G.I. Joe. Duke returned to active duty in G.I. Joe when the team was reinstated, though his maverick and dangerous behavior took some of his longtime colleagues by surprise, and caused him to relinquish his position as field commander for a more behind-the-scenes advisory role. Toys =Vintage/Modern= Duke was one of the first mail-away figures created in 1983 for the G.I. Joe 3 3/4\\" action figure line of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. He was later released as a carded figure in 1984, as part of the third series. The figure was recolored and released as the leader of the \\"Tiger Force\\" line in 1988. A new version of Duke was released in 1992. Another version was released as part of the Battle Corps line in 1993. New versions of Duke were also released in 1993 and 1994, as commander of the Star Brigade line. A version of Duke with no accessories came with the Built to Rule Armadillo Assault, which followed the G.I. Joe: Spy Troops story line. The forearms and the calves of the figure sported places where blocks could be attached.Armadillo Assault w/ Duke at YOJOE.com Retrieved 2012-04-23 The same figure was recolored and released in 2005 with the Built to Rule Freedom Defense Outpost.Freedom Defense Outpost w/ Duke at YOJOE.com Retrieved 2012-04-23 =Hall of Fame= In response to the high demand from nostalgic collectors of the vintage era G.I. Joe action figures, Hasbro introduced the G.I. Joe: Hall of Fame era of 12\\" action figures in 1991. Duke was the first 12\\" (30 cm) action figure produced in the Hasbro G.I. Joe line since 1978. The first 12\\" Duke was a Target Stores exclusive. The popularity of the figure convinced Hasbro to unleash a new series of 12\\" G.I. Joe action figures, known as the Hall of Fame series. These new 12\\" figures were based on the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series of 3.75\\" action figure characters. The 12\\" Duke had a headsculpt that was never used again for any other G.I. Joe figure, and was dressed for Desert Storm combat, with a backpack, commemorative stand, a light-up weapon with sound effects, grenades, and a Beretta handgun and holster. =25th anniversary= Duke was released in a box packed with Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Roadblock, and Gung-Ho, created from an entirely new mold that was based heavily on the original design. He was also released in several single packs (with one including his Jet Pack featured in the opening credits of G.I. Joe: The Movie), comic packs, movie packs (packaged with the greatest battles DVD), and multi-packs. Duke was one of the only G.I. Joe figures to be released in a special package for the G.I. Joe: Resolute animated series. =The Rise of Cobra= To coincide with the launch of the movie G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Hasbro released at least two figures in 2009 based on the Duke movie character. For both releases, he is listed as Conrad \\"Duke\\" Hauser. The first, classified as \\"Desert Ambush\\", features Duke in a desert camouflage uniform. The second, classified as \\"Reactive Impact Armor\\", features him in the movie style black uniform. Two versions of Duke were also released as part of \\"The Pursuit of Cobra\\" line in 2010, with non-actor based heads. =30th Anniversary= The G.I. Joe: Renegades version of Duke was released as an action figure in 2011, as part of the 30th Anniversary line. Three versions of Duke were released in 2012, the last one listed again as Conrad \\"Duke\\" Hauser to tie in with the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation. =G.I. Joe Classified Series= Q2 of 2020 sees the release of G.I. Joe Classified Series, a new line of highly articulated 6-inch scale action figures that includes prominent characters like Duke.

His next mission involves leading a team to push Cobra out of Trucial Abysmia, but intelligence vastly underestimates Cobra's presence there. Duke's squad is captured, and a misinterpreted order leads to several men being shot dead by a S.A.W. Viper. Doc, Heavy Metal, Thunder, and Crankcase are slain immediately. The Viper is wounded, and the survivors escape in a Cobra Rage tank. It is destroyed, killing Crazylegs, Breaker, and Quick Kick. Duke and the other two survivors, Cross-Country and Lt. Falcon, make it back to friendly lines safely.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #108-111 Duke would recover from that experience and lead the defense of the Joe headquarters, The Pit, against Cobra.G.I.

Joe: A Real American Hero #145-148 He would continue working with G.I. Joe until its disbandment. In an interview in ToyFare magazine, G.I. Joe comic book writer Larry Hama admitted he could never get a handle on Duke. According to Hama, military comic book conventions maintain that the commanding officer is the \\"good cop\\" and the first sergeant is the \\"bad cop,\\" and Duke, as first sergeant, never really fit the \\"bad cop\\" mold. =Devil's Due= After the disbandment, Duke went to take on black ops assignments for a secret government agency for a few years. It was during one of his missions that he discovers Cobra's attempt to make a comeback. He uses this information to help rally the effort to have G.I. Joe reinstated.G.I.

Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #37 (December 2004) America's Elite The team is reorganized in the G.I. Joe: America's Elite series. Duke disappears, going off on his own mission to locate Cobra Commander. During his search, he is captured by a group of B.A.T.s under the control of a Crimson Guardsman, who also had a grudge against Cobra Commander and wished to locate him. Duke frees himself, and after much torture, kills the Guardsman and saves Washington D.C. from being nuked. Civilians then treat his wounds and help him return home.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #7-10 (2006) Duke also assists his colleagues in defending their Yellowstone base from enemy infiltration.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #16-18 (2006) Following the invasion of The Rock, General Rey goes on a sabbatical to fill in some of the holes in his memory, and Duke accompanies him because he does not trust his intentions. They discover that Zandar was involved, and travel to the Florida Everglades, where they learn that one of Zandar's aliases was hired to broker a deal between The Coil and the Jugglers. This leads them to General Rey's psychiatrist Dr. Scott Stevens, who reveals that General Rey is a clone of Serpentor. Dr. Stevens is then revealed to be Cobra hypnotist Crystal Ball, who has brainwashed General Rey, and commands him to kill Duke. General Rey breaks free from Crystal Ball's control with Duke's help.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #19-20 (2007) Later, Duke deals with his father, a protester who dislikes the military.

Joe: America's Elite #30-33 (2007-2008) Hasbro later announced that all stories published by Devil's Due Publishing are no longer considered canonical, and are now considered an alternate continuity. IDW Publications In this continuity, Duke has been promoted to colonel after General Hawk is dismissed and is now the leader of the G.I. Joe team.G.I. Joe #12 (April 2012) =Alternate universe series= G.I. Joe Reloaded In this series, Duke is a double agent working for Cobra, due to his distress over the U.S. government's willingness to create destructive weaponry. In the final issue, he confronts Scarlett in a sewer system. She gains the upper hand and kills him with a knife to the back.G.I. Joe Reloaded #14 (April 2005) Fun Publications In the mirror universe created by Fun Publications, Duke's counterpart is Secretary of Defense Conrad Hauser, serving in the administration of U.S. President Joe Colton. In the story \\"Eye in the Sky\\", Hauser had to report to the president on the loss of an orbital defense satellite to the evil alien robots called the Autobots, and its eventual destruction thanks to the efforts of the heroic Decepticons. Animated series =A Real American Hero= In the first G.I. Joe miniseries The MASS Device, Duke is the field leader of G.I. Joe, under the command of General Flagg. Though the comic books and file cards say Duke is from St. Louis, Missouri, The MASS Device miniseries said that Duke was from Iowa. By the beginning of the first season of G.I. Joe, the role of commanding officer frequently alternated between Duke and Flint, the warrant officer who was introduced in The Revenge of Cobra miniseries. This was due in part to the series writers trying to balance the regulation of characters, based on the prominence of their action figures. In the second season, Hawk replaces Duke as commander of G.I. Joe. Duke becomes second-in-command, while Flint is the third man down. In the episode \\"The Synthoid Conspiracy\\", Duke was not only taken prisoner, but replaced with one of Destro's synthetic doppelgangers, in an attempt to get the G.I. Joe team disbanded permanently. Duke appears briefly alongside Torpedo in one of the series' public service announcements about the dangers of swimming alone. Duke was voiced by Michael Bell. G.I. Joe: The Movie In G.I. Joe: The Movie, Duke is the older half brother of Lt. Falcon. Duke was responsible for foiling Cobra's first attempt to take over the BET machine and captures Serpentor. With the aid of Cobra-La and the Dreadnoks, Serpentor escapes and gets his revenge during a second attempt to obtain the BET machine. Duke is critically wounded when Serpentor impales him in battle. We see Scarlett holding him as he asks his half brother Falcon to become a better soldier. His injuries cause him to slip into a coma. This makes the second time that Duke has lapsed into a coma - the first being in \\"The Traitor\\" two-part story, where his condition prevents him from letting the other Joes in on Dusty's triple-agent status. Duke's original fate in the movie was to die at the hands of Serpentor. However, due to fan backlash regarding the death of Optimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie, Hasbro asked for a re-edit, so Duke would merely fall into a coma following Serpentor's venomous attack, and a later edit added dialogue near the end of the movie, indicating Duke recovers from his injuries. =Spy Troops and Valor vs. Venom= Duke appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movies G.I. Joe: Spy Troops and G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom, voiced by John Payne. =Sigma 6= In G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, Duke is the leader of the G.I. Joe team. He has retained much of his personality from the A Real American Hero series. albeit looking much younger and with a new haircut. One other physical differentiation of this Duke from previous continuities, is the scar on his right cheek. He is still willing to go into the most dangerous situations, rather than send a member of his team to do it. This Duke is much more comfortable being the military man than engaging in social situations, as seen in the first-season episode \\"Vacation\\". =Resolute= Duke appeared in G.I. Joe: Resolute. He and the other Joes learn of Cobra Commander's latest scheme to take over the world with a particle superweapon, sending his various underlings across the globe to ensure its success. In the course of the storyline, Duke presents Scarlett with an ultimatum, to go with Snake Eyes or to remain with him, and she chooses to be with Duke. Later on while on a mission in Siberia, Duke gets injured fighting Zartan and orders Scarlett to leave him. She refuses and replies: \\"Oh, to hell with your orders! It's taken me years to sort out in my head what I want - who I want - and today I did. I'm staying with you, for all the time I have left. And if that's only six minutes, then damn it, I'm spending my last six minutes with you!\\" After the duo are picked up by Ripcord, Duke makes a vow to kill Cobra Commander for his actions over the course of the story, and leads the assault on the Cobra base in Springfield. He manages to get to the control room for the weapon, where the Commander gloats behind a bunker window that the weapon can't be stopped from firing on Washington D.C. Duke instead redirects the weapon to fire at the Springfield base, and though the area is decimated and the Joes evacuated, a field report at the end of the miniseries reveals in a return to the site, Duke found the bunker that Cobra Commander took shelter in to be empty. Duke was voiced by Steve Blum. =Renegades= In G.I. Joe: Renegades, Duke is a younger, and far more aggressive version than his other incarnations. Duke is a member of command staff, and makes the decision to expose the Cobra mega- corporation's true basis at cost, which results in them being branded as criminals following the destruction of Cobra Pharmaceuticals. He is also humble and selfless; during training Duke saves a fellow cadet who had stepped on a pressure-activated land mine, with Duke taking the small blunt of the blast scarring his back in the process. Duke also turns down an accommodation and a medal ceremony. In the two-part episode \\"Homecoming,\\" a flashback revealed that Duke was on a football team in his youth and went up against the football team that Flint was a part of. A play that Flint did ended up breaking Duke's leg costing him his college scholarship. A later encounter with Flint had Duke being given the offer to join the military. When he was assigned to work with Stalker to thwart a weapons trade held by M.A.R.S. Industries, Duke ended up disobeying orders when a M.A.R.S. Operative shoots down a helicopter that Lady Jaye was on and ended up saving her and the pilot. In the present, Duke splinters from the others when his parents Max and Connie are captured. During that time, he did have some problems with his brother Vince who was shown displeased with what happened at Cobra Pharmaceuticals and stated that their parents are in doubt about what happened. After Duke saves his parents and reunites with the other Joes, they arrive at the Hauser household where Connie wanted to treat them to a meal. Unfortunately, Vince had called Flint after he had warned Duke to stay away. Duke ends up defending his actions towards the other Joes and tells Flint upon the group's arrest to see that their families are protected. In the season finale, he obtains his trademark scar across his right eye as a result of a fight with Cobra Commander. Live action film Channing Tatum portrays Duke in the 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. He is the primary protagonist and is part of General Hawk's team. Contrary to his original back-story, he is a newcomer to the G.I. Joe team; all Joe rookies are already established, well-trained soldiers. Also in the 2009 film, Duke identifies himself as a Captain, while conspicuously wearing the rank of Major (Army) or Lt. Commander (Navy), although all versions of his action figure have him graded at Major/O-4. There is no reference in the film to him ever performing duties as a First Sergeant. He was also engaged to marry Ana Lewis, (who would end up becoming the Baroness), but left her at the altar because of guilt due to the apparent death of Ana's brother, Rex Lewis. Duke helps defeat and imprison Rex, now the leader of Cobra as the Cobra Commander. Tatum returns as Duke in the sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, where the character has been awarded his own team of Joes. After saving Flint, Duke is killed off early in the film via an airstrike ordered by Zartan (who was masquerading as the President of the United States). Zartan is exposed and killed by Storm Shadow, Cobra Commander escapes, and G.I. Joe is reinstated. Roadblock vows to go after Cobra Commander and avenge Duke. Director Jon M. Chu has stated that Duke may return in the third film. Video games Duke is one of the featured characters in the 1985 G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero computer game.

In the \\"Inside the Battlefield: The Weather Dominator\\" segment, it is mentioned that he and Snake Eyes were captured by Cobra and forced to battle each other. A recurring gag in that segment is that Duke can't understand what Snake Eyes wrote on the Etch A Sketch. In \\"PS: Yes In That Way\\", Duke introduces the G.I. Joe team to the newest recruit named Calvin, and ends up nicknaming him \\"Fumbles\\" for his clumsiness. After another of Calvin's clumsy moments during the introduction, Duke makes \\"Fumbles\\" the team's janitor. When Calvin defects to Cobra and snipes the G.I. Joe team, Calvin only leaves Duke alive. In \\"The Ramblings of Maurice,\\" he and the G.I. Joe members award Roadblock with a chocolate statue. After Junkyard eats the chocolate statue and dies, Duke speaks at Junkyard's funeral, and has Junkyard's name added to the Wall of Fallen Heroes. Amazed that Junkyard was the only name on the list, he bets that Cobra's Wall of Fallen Villains is full of names. * Duke's romantic inclinations are touched on in the non-fiction paperback Saturday Morning Fever. * Michael Bell reprises his role of Duke in the Community episode \\"G.I.

The main character, Alexandra Bergson, inherits the family farmland when her father dies, and she devotes her life to making the farm a viable enterprise at a time when many other immigrant families are giving up and leaving the prairie. The novel is also concerned with two romantic relationships, one between Alexandra and family friend Carl Linstrum and the other between Alexandra's brother Emil and the married Marie Shabata. Plot summary The book is divided into five parts, each of which has numerous chapters. =Part I ‚Äì The Wild Land= On a windy January day in Hanover, Nebraska, Alexandra Bergson is with her five-year-old brother Emil, whose little kitten has climbed a telegraph pole and is afraid to come down. Alexandra asks her neighbor and friend Carl Linstrum to retrieve the kitten. Later, Alexandra finds Emil in the general store with Marie Tovesky. They are playing with the kitten. Marie lives in Omaha and is visiting her uncle Joe Tovesky. Alexandra's father is dying, and it is his wish that she run the farm after he is gone. Alexandra and her brothers Oscar and Lou later visit Ivar, known as Crazy Ivar because of his unorthodox views. For instance, he sleeps in a hammock, believes in killing no living thing and goes barefoot summer and winter. But he is known for healing sick animals. Alexandra is concerned about their hogs as the hogs of many of their neighbors are dying. Crazy Ivar advises her to keep their hogs clean rather than letting them live in filth and to give them fresh, clean water and good food. This simply confirms Oscar's and Lou's opinion that Ivar deserves the name Crazy Ivar. Alexandra, however, starts making plans for where she will relocate the hogs. After years of crop failure, many of the Bergson's neighbors are selling out, even if it means taking a loss. Then they learn the Linstrums have also decided to leave. Oscar and Lou want to leave too, but neither their mother nor Alexandra will. After visiting villages downwards to see how they are getting on, Alexandra talks her brothers into mortgaging the farm to buy more land, in hopes of ending up as rich landowners. =Part II ‚Äì Neighboring Fields= Sixteen years later, the farms are now prosperous. Alexandra and her brothers have divided up their inheritance, and Emil has just returned from college. The Linstrum farm has failed, and Marie, now married to Frank Shabata, has bought it. That same day, the Bergsons are surprised by a visit from Carl Linstrum, whom they have not seen for thirteen years.Sparknotes.com [Note: Carl says it has been sixteen years, but this is a textual error. John Bergson died sixteen years earlier, and Carl's family left during the drought that occurred three years later.] Having failed at a job in Chicago, he is on his way to Alaska, but decides to stay with Alexandra for a while. Carl notices the growing flirtatious relationship between Emil and Marie. Lou and Oscar suspect that Carl wants to marry Alexandra, and are resentful at the idea that Carl might end up owning Alexandra's share of the farm, which they still view as belonging to them and which would otherwise be inherited by their children. This causes problems between Alexandra and her brothers, and they stop speaking to each other. Carl, recognizing a problem, decides to leave for Alaska. At the same time, Emil announces he is leaving to travel through Mexico. Alexandra is left alone. =Part III ‚Äì Winter Memories= Alexandra spends the winter alone, except for occasional visits from Marie, whom she visits with Mrs. Lee, Lou's mother-in-law. She also has an increased number of the mysterious dreams she has had since girlhood. These dreams are about a strong, god-like male figure who carries her over the fields. =Part IV ‚Äì The White Mulberry Tree= Emil returns from Mexico City. His best friend, Am√©d√©e, is now married with a young son. At a fair at the French church, Emil and Marie kiss for the first time. They later confess their illicit love, and Emil determines to leave for law school in Michigan. Before he leaves, Am√©d√©e dies from a ruptured appendix, and as a result both Emil and Marie realize what they value most. Before leaving for Michigan, Emil stops by Marie's farm to say one last goodbye, and they fall into a passionate embrace beneath the white mulberry tree. They stay there for several hours, until Marie's husband, Frank, finds them and shoots them in a drunken rage. He flees to Omaha, where he later turns himself in for the crime. Ivar discovers Emil's abandoned horse, leading him to search for the boy and discover the bodies. =Part V ‚Äì Alexandra= After Emil's death Alexandra is distraught, in shock, and slightly dazed. She goes off in a rainstorm. Ivar goes looking for her and brings her back home, where she sleeps fitfully and dreams about death. She then decides to visit Frank in Lincoln where he is incarcerated. While in town she walks by Emil's university campus, comes upon a polite young man who reminds her of Emil, and feels better. The next day she talks to Frank in prison. He is bedraggled and can barely speak properly, and she promises to do what she can to see him released; she bears no ill will toward him. She then receives a telegram from Carl, telling her that he is back. They decide to marry, unconcerned with the approval of her brothers.

The nearest town to Cossack is Wickham. Cossack is located on Butchers Inlet at the mouth of the Harding River. It is reached by a single, sealed road that follows the original causeway across a series of tidal salt flats. The overall landform of the region around Cossack is a low, flat plain with occasional rocky hills and ranges. The vegetation is mainly grass, spinifex and low shrub, with occasional trees (mangroves) along watercourses and in gullies. The mangrove scrub becomes quite dense along the shoreline and at the mouth of the inlet. The main road from Roebourne to Cossack continues past the town of Wickham and the Cape Lambert iron ore port (operated by Pilbara Iron), and terminates at the fishing town of Point Samson. The townsite is not visible from the main road, and only becomes apparent as the road rounds Nanny Goat Hill. The site of the former town is defined by Nanny Goat Hill, Tien Tsin Lookout, the hilly ground to the north-east and north-west, and Butchers Inlet to the east and south-east. Past the townsite, the road winds up to the Reader Head Lookout, from which sweeping views of the surrounding coastline can be seen. Many of the buildings are listed by the National Trust. The erstwhile Tien Tsin Harbour is now known as Port Walcott.  Post-contact history  Cossack in 1898, from Nannygoat Hill. In May 1863, Walter Padbury landed his stock at the mouth of the Harding River near the present site of Cossack. Cossack was first known as Tien Tsin Harbour, after the barque that carried Padbury and his party. The ship that brought the state's Governor, Frederick Weld, in December 1871 was named HMS Cossack and the town adopted this name in 1872. Cossack was the first port in the North West, and was critical to the development of the pastoral industry in the region.  Pearling  In 1866 the town of Roebourne was declared, and the pearling industry began in the region. Cossack was the birthplace of Western Australia‚Äôs pearling industry and was the home of the colony‚Äôs pearling fleet until the 1880s. Many small boats off the Port Walcott coast dived for pearl shell during the 1860s using Aboriginal labour, including women and children. By early 1869, there were 14 small vessels pearling in the area, with an average crew of three Europeans and six Aboriginals. By the early 1870s up to 80 luggers were operating in the area. The pearling industry also attracted a large Asian population. By 1895, there were 989 Malays and 493 Aboriginals employed on 57 vessels at Cossack. The high number of Asians in the industry, including Japanese and Chinese as well as Malay, led to the establishment of an Asian quarter known as \\"Chinatown\\". In 1881 a cyclone damaged the town, and every pearling vessel then operating either foundered or was beached. In 1885, 44 vessels were operating out of Cossack. In that year a parliamentary select committee recommended the closure of several pearling banks in the area due to depletion. In 1886, the main pearling industry moved to Broome. In the 1920s there was still a Japanese shop in Cossack, run by pearling brothers Jiro and T. Muramats Causeway and tramway long, gauge Cossack-Roebourne horse-hauled tramway, photographed in 1909 at Roeburne During the 1870s, a causeway was built across the tidal salt flats that separate Cossack from the main road. The causeway still forms the only access to the town from land. A horse-drawn tramway between Roebourne and Cossack was completed in 1887, pages 7 to 16 'Roebourne - Cossack Tramway' the same year that the municipality of Cossack was declared, and the north-west gold rush commenced. Heritage buildings The main stone buildings were constructed in the 1880s. Administrative and other public buildings built there in the 1890s continued a style adopted by the emerging state; these have been surveyed by state heritage groups and determined to be architecturally and historically significant.

Decline of the township Following the move of the pearling industry to Broome and the decline of the gold rush, the population of Cossack dwindled. The harbour proved unsuitable for the larger ships of the early 20th century. Between 1902 and 1904, a jetty was constructed at the nearby hamlet of Point Samson. In 1910, the port moved there and the municipality of Cossack was dissolved. In 1913 a leprosarium was established on the other side of the river, moving to Darwin in 1930. Wool bales and pearls would be loaded on to a lighter for transport to ships 3 miles off shore which would take the cargo to England. Inhabitants of the town in the early twentieth century included Greeks and other Europeans, Japanese, Malays, Timorese, Koepangers and Aru Islanders. The town was abandoned in the 1950s. The region is subject to violent storms and cyclones and was severely damaged at different times in its history. Its use as a port for the profitable pearling industry and other economic booms saw investment and backing from Perth and it remained an important northern port. The town was abandoned after the 1940s, leaving substantial stone buildings in a state of disrepair. The state government established a survey, in 2007, into the potential for restoration or revitalisation of this remote town.  Cemetery  thumb Cossack contains a small cemetery comprising separate European and Japanese precincts. The pearling industry of the 19th century was notably dangerous, with many pearlers losing their lives. Those buried in the Japanese cemetery were mainly divers and others involved with the pearling industry; others, including many Aborigines, were lost at sea. The first interment in the cemetery is believed to have taken place in 1869, when a man died while walking to Port Walcott in January and was buried there.Master Plan 2006 At least 41 Europeans and seven Japanese were buried there, with the last interment recorded in 1915. Those buried there include William Shakespeare Hall.

He was the younger brother of both Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd, Prince of Wales) and of Owain Goch ap Gruffydd. He was probably the younger brother of Dafydd ap Gruffydd of Gwynedd but may have been the older as there are no accurate records of their birth dates.  History  Rhodri was born in the early 1230s. His father was Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, the illegitimate but eldest son of Llywelyn the Great, and his mother was Senena ferch Caradog. Little is known about his early life except that on his grandfather's death in 1240 his uncle Dafydd ap Llywelyn (his father's younger, but legitimate, half brother) inherited the throne and immediately imprisoned his father, thus disinheriting him. Gruffudd was subsequently relinquished by Dafydd under the terms of the Treaty of Gwerneigron following Henry III's invasion of 1241, and taken to London as a hostage where he died in 1244 during a failed attempt to escape from the Tower of London. Also in 1241, Rhodri along with his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd were sent as hostages to King Henry. Dafydd ap Llywelyn seized the opportunity to wage war against Henry, defeating him in battle in the summer of 1245 during Henry's second invasion of Wales. In February 1246 Dafydd died without legitimate male heirs, and the throne was inherited under Welsh Law by the four sons of the now dead Gruffudd. A massive struggle ensued between them all but by the 1250s Rhodri's elder brother Llywelyn had consolidated his position as prince and successfully excluded the other siblings from power. Rhodri alone appears to have avoided getting involved in the fighting and by 1272 had agreed to sell his inheritance rights to Llywelyn. It is possible that to enforce this sale that he became Llywelyn's Penteulu, which under Welsh law would mean that he took himself out of the line of succession. By 1282 (and possibly even earlier) Rhodri had come into the possession of the manor of Bidfield in Gloucestershire. He married into a noble Cheshire family and acquired property there through his wife, Beatrice de Malpas. Some sources claim that on her death he married one Catherine and by c. 1309 had acquired the manor of Tatsfield in Surrey. Rhodri died c. 1315. As the only surviving brother of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd after 1283 he would have been regarded by many as a legitimate claimant to the throne of Gwynedd, and therefore also to the title Prince of Wales. He is reputed to have had at least one son, Thomas ap Rhodri (by Catherine), who was the father to Owain Lawgoch and a daughter, Katherine, who married into the De La Pole family. Tatsfield Manor Academic research by Professor Anthony Carr indicated that the manor of Tatsfield in Surrey was in the possession of Rhodri ap Gruffudd and his descendants during the 14th century. Rhodri‚Äôs son, Thomas ap Rhodri, and his grandson, Owain ap Thomas (Owain Lawgoch), may have been born in Tatsfield. Owain Lawgoch eventually became one of France‚Äôs leading mercenary captains fighting against the English during the 1360s and 1370s and was eventually assassinated in 1378 under the orders of the English Crown because of the threat he presented to the political stability of Wales after he declared himself Prince of Wales. Documentary sources suggested Tatsfield manor house was demolished in 1801. However, the investigations revealed that Thomas had borrowed money to build a new house during the 1320s and that his house and associated complex had been systematically dismantled at the end of the 14th century, most probably under the orders of the English Crown and in a very similar fashion to the way such llys or palace complexes were removed by Edward I in Wales.

Horse training refers to a variety of practices that teach horses to perform certain behaviors when commanded to do so by humans. Horses are trained to be manageable by humans for everyday care as well as for equestrian activities from horse racing to therapeutic horseback riding for people with disabilities. Historically, horses were trained for warfare, farm work, sport and transport. Today, most horse training is geared toward making horses useful for a variety of recreational and sporting equestrian pursuits. Horses are also trained for specialized jobs from movie stunt work to police and crowd control activities, circus entertainment, and equine-assisted psychotherapy. There is tremendous controversy over various methods of horse training and even some of the words used to describe these methods. Some techniques are considered cruel, other methods are considered gentler and more humane. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to go into the details of various training methodology, so general, basic principles are described below. The see also section of this article provides links to more specific information about various schools and techniques of horse training. Goals Effective communication and harmony between horse and rider are among the goals of proper training The range of training techniques and training goals is large, but basic animal training concepts apply to all forms of horse training. The initial goal of most types of training is to create a horse that is safe for humans to handle (under most circumstances) and able to perform a useful task for the benefit of humans. A few specific considerations and some basic knowledge of horse behavior helps a horse trainer be effective no matter what school or discipline is chosen: *Safety is paramount: Horses are much larger and stronger than humans, so must be taught behavior that will not injure people. *Horses, like other animals, differ in brain structure from humans and thus do not have the same type of thinking and reasoning ability as human beings. Thus, the human has the responsibility to think about how to use the psychology of the horse to lead the animal into an understanding of the goals of the human trainer. *Horses are social herd animals and, when properly handled, can learn to follow and respect a human leader. *Horses, as prey animals, have an inborn fight or flight instinct that can be adapted to human needs. Horses need to be taught to rely upon humans to determine when fear or flight is an appropriate response to new stimuli and not to react by instinct alone. *Like most animals, a young horse will more easily adapt to human expectations than an older one, so human handling of the horse from a very early age is generally advised. Stages Regardless of the goal of training, most horses go through a predictable series of steps on their way to being \\"finished\\" animals for a given discipline. =Training of foals and younger horses= Most young domesticated horses are handled at birth or within the first few days of life, though some are only handled for the first time when they are weaned from their mothers, or dams. Advocates of handling foals from birth sometimes use the concept of imprinting to introduce a foal within its first few days and weeks of life to many of the activities they will see throughout their lives. Within a few hours of birth, a foal being imprinted will have a human touch it all over, pick up its feet, and introduce it to human touch and voice. Others may leave a foal alone for its first few hours or days, arguing that it is more important to allow the foal to bond with its dam. However, even people who do not advocate imprinting often still place value on handling a foal a great deal while it is still nursing and too small to easily overpower a human. By doing so, the foal ideally will learn that humans will not harm it, but also that humans must be respected. yearling, are shown in conformation classes. While a foal is far too young to be ridden, it is still able to learn skills it will need later in life. By the end of a foal's first year, it should be halter-broke, meaning that it allows a halter placed upon its head and has been taught to be led by a human at a walk and trot, to stop on command and to stand tied. The young horse needs to be calm for basic grooming, as well as veterinary care such as vaccinations and de-worming. A foal needs regular hoof care and can be taught to stand while having its feet picked up and trimmed by a farrier. Ideally a young horse should learn all the basic skills it will need throughout its life, including: being caught from a field, loaded into a horse trailer, and not to fear flapping or noisy objects. It also can be exposed to the noise and commotion of ordinary human activity, including seeing motor vehicles, hearing radios, and so on. More advanced skills sometimes taught in the first year include learning to accept blankets placed on it, to be trimmed with electric clippers, and to be given a bath with water from a hose. The foal may learn basic voice commands for starting and stopping, and sometimes will learn to square its feet up for showing in in-hand or conformation classes. If these tasks are completed, the young horse will have no fear of things placed on its back, around its belly or in its mouth. Some people, whether through philosophy or simply due to being pressed for time, do not handle foals significantly while they are still nursing, but wait until the foal is weaned from its dam to begin halter breaking and the other tasks of training a horse in its first year. The argument for gentling and halter-breaking at weaning is that the young horse, in crisis from being separated from its dam, will more readily bond with a human at weaning than at a later point in its life. Sometimes the tasks of basic gentling are not completed within the first year but continue when the horse is a yearling. Yearlings are larger and more unpredictable than weanlings, plus often are easily distracted, in part due to the first signs of sexual maturity. However, they also are still highly impressionable, and though very quick and agile, are not at their full adult strength. Rarer, but not uncommon even in the modern world, is the practice of leaving young horses completely unhandled until they are old enough to be ridden, usually between the age of two and four, and completing all ground training as well as training for riding at the same time. However, waiting until a horse is full grown to begin training is often far riskier for humans and requires considerably more skill to avoid injury. =Ground training= A young horse in Europe being longed with a surcingle and side reins After a young horse is taught to lead and other basic skills, various tasks can be introduced to the horse as it matures while it is still too young to be ridden. Some schools of training do a great deal of work with young horses during their yearling and two-year-old years to prepare them for riding, others merely reinforce the basic lessons taught to the horse as a foal and simply keep the horse accustomed to the presence of humans. Many times, a young horse did not have all necessary basic skills described above taught to it as a foal and its \\"adolescent\\" years are spent learning or re- learning basic lessons. Several ground training techniques are commonly introduced to a young horse some time after it is a year old, but prior to being ridden. All horses usually have some or all of this ground work done prior to being ridden, though the time spent can range from hours to months. While a foal or yearling can be introduced to a small amount of ground work, a young horse's bones and joints are quite soft and fragile. So, to prevent joint and cartilage injury, intense work, particularly intense work in a confined circle (such as advanced roundpenning or longeing), should wait until the horse is at least two years old. Common ground training techniques include: *Liberty work, sometimes called free longeing, round pen work or roundpenning, but regardless of terminology, is the process of working a loose horse in a small area (usually a round pen 40‚Äì60 feet/15‚Äì20 meters in diameter) with the handler holding only a long whip or a rope lariat, teaching the horse to respond to the voice and body language of the handler as he or she asks the horse to move faster or slower, to change direction, and to stop. *Longeing (Lungeing- UK), pronounced \\"lungeing\\", the training of a young horse to move in circles at the end of a long rope or line, usually about 25 to 30 feet long. *Desensitization, sometimes called sacking out, the process of introducing a horse to flapping objects such as blankets, teaching the horse to allow itself to be touched by an object and not to fear things that people move about a horse. *Introduction to a saddle and bridle or harness, without actually getting on the horse or hooking up a cart. *Ground driving, also called long-lining, teaching a young horse to move forward with a person walking behind it, a precursor to both harness driving and having reins used by a mounted rider. *Bitting, the process of accustoming a horse to a bit and bridle, sometimes with the addition of side reins that attach to a saddle, harness, or surcingle (a wide leather or nylon band that goes around the horse's barrel) and accustom the horse to the feel of pressure on the bit. A horse is not ready to be ridden until it is accustomed to all the equipment that it needs to wear and is responsive to basic voice, and usually rein, commands to start, stop, turn and change gaits. For some disciplines, ground work is also used to develop specific types of muscling as well as to instill certain behaviors. When ground work incorporates both mental and muscular development, it may take considerably longer for the horse to be ready to be ridden, but advocates of these methods maintain that the additional time on the ground allows the horse to advance more quickly or with better manners once under saddle. =\\"Backing\\" or riding the young horse= A young Lipizzan at the Spanish Riding School in training equipment, wearing saddle, bridle and longeing cavesson so that it may be longed prior to being ridden. The age that horses are first ridden, or \\"backed\\" (UK) varies considerably by breed and discipline. Many Thoroughbred race horses have small, light riders on their backs as early as the fall of their yearling year. Most stock horse breeds, such as the American Quarter Horse, are ridden at the age of two. Most horses used in harness have a cart first put behind them at age two, and even some horses not ridden until age three will be trained to pull a light cart at two, in order to learn better discipline and to help develop stronger muscles with less stress. The vast majority of horses across disciplines and throughout the world are first put under saddle at the age of three. However, some slower- maturing breeds, such as the Lipizzan, are not ridden until the age of four. The act of getting on a horse for the first time goes by many names, including backing, breaking, mounting, and simply riding. There are many techniques for introducing the young horse to a rider or to a harness and cart for driving, but the end goal of all methods is to have the horse calmly and quietly allow a rider on its back or behind it in a cart and to respond to basic commands to go forward, change gaits and speed, stop, turn and back up. Ideally, a young horse will have no fear of humans and view being ridden as simply one more new lesson. A properly handled young horse that had adequate ground work will seldom buck, rear, or run away when it is ridden, even for the very first time. Discipline-specific training can take years to perfect. Horses that have never been taught to be ridden can learn at any age, though it may take somewhat longer to teach an older horse. An older horse that is used to humans but has no prior bad habits is easier to put under saddle than is a completely feral horse caught \\"wild\\" off the open range as an adult. However, an adult feral horse may be easier to train than a domesticated animal that has previously learned to treat humans with disrespect.Meredith, Ron. \\"The Training Tree: Putting it all Together\\" Meredith Manor\\"How do I choose the right one?\\" Training for a specific discipline There are many horse training philosophies and techniques and details are far too extensive to describe in a single article. Also, horses have different conformation, athletic potential, temperaments and personalities, all of which may influence what techniques are used.

History Nikujaga was invented by chefs of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the late 19th century. The story that T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç ordered naval cooks to create a version of the beef stews served in the British Royal Navy was devised as part of an ongoing campaign beginning in 1895 to promote the city of Maizuru, Kyoto, which hosted an Imperial Japanese Navy base where T≈çg≈ç was stationed, as the birthplace of nikujaga.Asami Nagai, \\"Cities claim signature dishes cooked up in navy galleys\\" , Yomiuri Shimbun, 5 February 2000.

The massif also occurs in the Belgian subsurface, where it is bounded to the northeast by the Roer Valley Graben that runs diagonally through Dutch Limburg. The Midlands Microcraton (southeastern Wales and part of western England) is often considered part of the massif and to reflect this the names Wales‚ÄìBrabant Massif, Wales‚ÄìLondon‚ÄìBrabant Massif and Wales‚ÄìBrabant High are sometimes used. The London‚ÄìBrabant Massif is part of the former microcontinent Avalonia. To the south it borders the Rhenohercynian Zone of the Hercynian orogeny. To the northeast it is flanked by the Anglo-Dutch Basin in the subsurface of the North Sea. At times in geologic history the London‚ÄìBrabant Massif formed an island, which is called the London-Brabant Island. Formation The massif is composed of crystalline basement (metamorphic and igneous rocks) with Proterozoic to early Paleozoic ages. It was deformed and metamorphosed during the Cadomian orogeny (Ediacaran, about ago) and Caledonian orogeny (Silurian, about ). This basement is almost everywhere overlain by younger sedimentary rocks, except for some places in the southwest of England and in Wales. The continent Avalonia was until the Ordovician () part of the large southern continent Gondwana, but then began drifting independently to lower latitudes. As it passed through the dry latitudes represented today by the Namib Desert1, it was eroded and the soils became laterite. The strata, particularly of the Precambrian are complex. Their continuity is also poorly understood because they are beyond the reach of most boreholes. Carboniferous Period The period from which the island has exercised most economic influence on modern Europe was the Carboniferous. As the continent was drifting past the Equator, on the island's shores, there grew a rich tropical forest swamp. On the island's southern shore, it left the Dinantian, Namurian and Westphalian coal fields of France, Belgium and western Germany. See Aachener Revier (in German). To its northwest, the thinner crust between it and the Market Weighton Axis was crumpled between the blocks leaving low ridges of wet land between strips of water such as the Widmerpool Gulf. On the wet land, the coal fields of Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire were deposited. These extend further east but are now at ever greater depth. At the modern east Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire coast for example, their upper surface is at about 2 km depth. These Carboniferous beds are part of a system linking with those of Westphalia, around the north side of the island. On the north Norfolk coast, the line of the Carboniferous shore roughly coincides with the modern one.2 The Permian and Triassic As the continent drifted northwards, away from the Equator, through the latitudes represented today by the Sahara desert, the erosion was renewed. This time, the lateritic soils are represented by the New Red Sandstone and the red soils of Leicestershire and Rutland. The early Permian was the time of the height of the Variscan earth movements as the crust to the south was crushed against the island. The great disturbances seen at the surface in Brittany, the Ardennes and the Rhineland also lie below the Paris Basin. They fade out in the gentler anticline of the downs and Weald of southern England which overlies the edge of the island. The axis of this anticline is normally called the northern Variscan front. However, the chalk of the downs is Upper Cretaceous, so the process continued well after the Permian. The point in the present context is that the stability of the island contrasts with the relatively unstable crust to its south, which was forced into a long mountain ridge. To the north, economically important things were happening. Western Britain was pushed up as part of the Variscan Orogeny while the east of Britain, including the island began to subside leaving a broad basin, north of the island and south of Scandinavia. This formed a shallow sea in a very dry climate. Desert sands and salt basins were a result but there are also mudstones. This provided the alternating porous and impervious rocks which have trapped the gas escaping when the coal measures, below were subjected to geothermal heat. This has left a group of gas fields off the Norfolk coast. That is to say, off the coast of the island. Rhaetic transgression In the early Jurassic, the Rhaetic sea flooded much of the Permian plain. On the margin of the London-Brabant Island, the estuarine conditions which left the Lower Estuarine Series prevailed for a while before the sea rose so as to deposit the Lincolnshire limestones before falling again so that the Upper Estuarine Series was left. Again the sea rose to deposit the Blisworth Limestone, the Blisworth Clay and the Upper Jurassic clays. The same general pattern occurred in France leaving the Paris Basin flooded from Anjou to Luxembourg. Cretaceous Seismicity in the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2008-02-27 By the Cretaceous the island had sunk much further in relation to the sea level. Before the end of the period, the British end was buried in Upper Cretaceous chalk. This happened because the Pacific Ocean bed swelled up causing the world's seas to rise but also, the process released much carbon dioxide. Modern existence It is now best viewed as a block of dense crust floating deeply sunk into the mantle and overlain with less dense superficial rocks. It depresses the boundary of the crust and the mantle (Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity, commonly Moho) to depths greater than 40 kilometres as against a figure at the top of the continental shelf of about thirty and less than fifteen below oceanic depths.3 The map shows that there is some tendency for such seismic activity as there is in the region, to occur around the margin of the massif. It was into this pattern that the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580 and the 2008 Lincolnshire earthquake, the latter marked by an orange star, fell.

Use of the line increased until 1943, when the end of gas rationing and the increased use of automobiles caused a slow decline in passenger traffic. On February 1, 1957, passenger service ended on the L&PS; line.History of L&PS; / PSTR Afterwards, the railway continued to carry freight traffic, especially between St. Thomas and London, Ontario. The rail section between St. Thomas and Port Stanley fell into disrepair and was finally abandoned in 1982 after a washout. When the line was officially abandoned, a group of railway preservationists created the Port Stanley Terminal Rail Inc. and purchased the rail to be used as a heritage railway. After rebuilding the tracks, the group finally received a Provincial railway charter to operate trains between the cities of St. Thomas and Port Stanley in 1987. This was the first charter issued in Ontario in several decades.

His best-known songs are \\"There! I've Said It Again\\" (1945), popularized first by Vaughn Monroe and later by Bobby Vinton, \\"No Moon at All\\" (1947), recorded by Robert Goulet in (1963) and \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\\" (1955), recorded most notably by Frank Sinatra, but covered by many other artists over the decades. Career Mann was able to play the piano by ear, at the age of 4, and by age 13, he was playing around Philadelphia. He attended the Curtis Institute of Music. In late 1939, Mann moved to New York and became a Decca Records session musician. He was in Charley Spivak's orchestra until 1941. During World War II, Mann joined the United States Army. Upon his discharge from the Army in 1945, they had the honor of placing Mann as personal pianist to President Truman. Mann worked on or appeared in the films: Twenty Grand, I Dood It, Four Jills and a Jeep, Pin-Up Girl, and, during his Artie Shaw days, Second Chorus. Mann wrote the song \\"Somebody Bad Stole de Wedding Bell\\", recorded by Eartha Kitt between 1952 and 1954. The song was released as a B-side to her 1954 non-album single \\"Lovin' Spree\\". As a B-side to \\"Lovin' Spree\\", the single charted at number 20 on the current US Billboard music chart. Later, in 2006, the song was released as a CD bonus track to her album That Bad Eartha. His most enduring composition was \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\\", written with Bob Hilliard. The song has over 500 cover versions to its credit, over 100 available today on iTunes. The song enjoys wide acclaim, and the Sinatra album has been considered the first 'concept album'. Jazz musicians love \\"No Moon At All,\\" written with lyricist Redd Evans, which follows the baroque chord changes of Bach's Double Violin Concerto. One of Mann's hits \\"There I've Said it Again\\"‚Äîthe Bobby Vinton version of 1963‚Äîwas the last #1 in the United States before the British Invasion.

The road is an important link between the three towns as it is a very productive farming region. The Irrigation Way provides a direct route between the national highway network and Griffith. This complements the two state routes that pass through Griffith. The route is most important in linking Leeton to other regions of the state as it is the only major road passing through the town.  Towns  Narrandera: Irrigation Way begins off the Newell Highway near the bridge over the Murrumbidgee River and from the junction with the Sturt Highway. The Narrandera Airport is also located on the Irrigation Way, from Narrandera. Irrigation Way reaches the Shire of Leeton shortly after the airport. Leeton: Irrigation Way begins in the Leeton Shire between Narrandera Airport and the turn off to Rockdale Beef. After travelling approximately the small village of Yanco is reached. The Yanco CBD is located on Irrigation Way as Main Street. Leeton is located from Yanco. Leeton's CBD is also found on Irrigation Way.

This is part of the process that regulates the transcription of RNA to preserve gene expression integrity and are present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, although the process in bacteria is more widely understood. The most extensively studied and detailed transcriptional termination factor is the Rho (œÅ) protein of E. coli.  Prokaryotic  Prokaryotes use one type of RNA polymerase, transcribing mRNAs that code for more than one type of protein. Transcription, translation and mRNA degradation all happen simultaneously. Transcription termination is essential to define boundaries in transcriptional units, a function necessary to maintain the integrity of the strands and provide quality control. Termination in E. coli may be Rho dependent, utilizing Rho factor, or Rho independent, also known as intrinsic termination. Although most operons in DNA are Rho independent, Rho dependent termination is also essential to maintain correct transcription. œÅ factor The Rho protein is an RNA translocase that recognizes a cytosine-rich region of the elongating mRNA, but the exact features of the recognized sequences and how the cleaving takes place remain unknown. Rho forms a ring-shaped hexamer and advances along the mRNA, hydrolyzing ATP toward RNA polymerase (5' to 3' with respect to the mRNA). When the Rho protein reaches the RNA polymerase complex, transcription is terminated by dissociation of the RNA polymerase from the DNA. The structure and activity of the Rho protein is similar to that of the F1 subunit of ATP synthase, supporting the theory that the two share an evolutionary link. Rho factor is widely present in different bacterial sequences and is responsible for the genetic polarity in E. coli. It works as a sensor of translational status, inhibiting non-productive transcriptions, suppressing antisense transcriptions and resolving conflicts that happen between transcription and replication. The process of termination by Rho factor is regulated by attenuation and antitermination mechanisms, competing with elongation factors for overlapping utilization sites (ruts and nuts), and depends on how fast Rho can move during the transcription to catch up with the RNA polymerase and activate the termination process. Inhibition of Rho dependent termination by bicyclomycin is used to treat bacterial infections. The use of this mechanism along with other classes of antibiotics is being studied as a way to address antibiotic resistance, by suppressing the protective factors in RNA transcription while working in synergy with other inhibitors of gene expression such as tetracycline or rifampicin.  Eukaryotic  The process of transcriptional termination is less understood in eukaryotes, which have extensive post-transcriptional RNA processing, and each of the three types of eukaryotic RNA polymerase have a different termination system. In RNA polymerase I, Transcription termination factor, RNA polymerase I binds downstream of the pre-rRNA coding regions, causing the dissociation of the RNA polymerase from the template and the release of the new RNA strand. In RNA polymerase II, the termination occurs via a polyadenylation/cleaving complex. The 3' tail on the ending of the strand is bound at the polyadenylation site, but the strand will continue to code. The newly formed amino acids are removed one at a time by the cleavage factors CSTF and CPSF, in a process that is still not fully understood. The remainder of the strand is disengaged by a 5‚Ä≤-exonuclease when the transcription is finished. RNA polymerase III terminates after a series of uracil polymerization residues in the transcribed mRNA. Unlike in bacteria and in polymerase I, the termination RNA hairpin needs to be upstream to allow for correct cleaving.

When the Buwayhids were ousted by the Seljuks in 1055, he transferred his allegiance to the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, in whose name he conquered Baghdad, which he ruled for almost a year. Early years The name al-BasƒÅsƒ´rƒ´ (or al-FasƒÅsƒ´rƒ´, al-FasƒÅwƒ´) is a nisba derived from his first owner's place of origin, BasƒÅ (FasƒÅ) in the province of Fars. Abu æl-·∏§ƒÅrith is a kunya, while his ism (given name) was the Turkish ArslƒÅn. He became a freedman (mawlƒÅ) of the Buwayhid emir Baha al-Dawla (). His military career, however, can be traced only from the reign of Baha's son, Jalal al- Dawla (). Al-Basasiri took part in Jalal's conflicts with his nephew, Abu Kalijar, the emir of Fars, and with the rival Uqaylid dynasty of Mosul. He was also a favourite of the Buwayhid emir al-Malik al-Rahim (), from whom he received the town of Anbar as a fief. This was a period of growing unrest among the Turkish troops in Baghdad, growing strife between Sunni and Shi'a, constant Kurdish raiding and the ongoing war with the Uqaylids. Conflict with the vizier, 1054‚Äì55 In 1054, al-Basasiri was unable to prevent Turkish troops from rioting and looting in Baghdad. In the same year the Uqaylid leader Quraysh raided Baradan and carried off al-Basasiri's camels and horses. In November, Quraysh captured Anbar and formally renounced Buwayhid lordship, ordering the Seljuk sultan Tughrul to be named in the public sermon (khu·π≠ba) during Friday prayer. According to Ibn al-Athir's Complete History, \\"the estrangement of the [Abbasid] caliph and Basasiri began this year in Ramadan\\", that is, between 4 December 1054 and 2 January 1055. In 1054, al-Basasiri fell out with the caliphal vizier Ibn al-Muslima over Turkish policy. He accused the vizier of being in contact with Tughrul since 1052/3. Ibn al-Muslima in turn blocked al-Basasiri's efforts to combat Quraysh's supporters in Baghdad. In retaliation, al-Basasiri impounded the vizier's boat and cut off his monthly stipend. He also cut off the caliph al-Qa'im's monthly subsidy. In March 1055 al-Basasiri reconquered Anbar. On his way he plundered the villages of Dimimma and Fallujah. He was joined by his brother-in-law, Dubays I of the Mazyadid dynasty. Anbar was defended by the Uqaylid client Abu'l-Ghana'im ibn al-Muhallaban. Al-Basasiri, employing trebuchets and Greek fire, destroyed a tower and some defensive works. The town was stormed and Abu'l-Ghana'im was captured along a hundred Khafaja soldiers. The conflict with the vizier continued after al-Basasiri's return to Baghdad. In July 1055, during a Sunni protest, the vizier convinced some fanatics to board a ship and break some wine jars belonging to a Christian merchant and destined for al-Basasiri, then staying at Wasit with the Buwayhid sultan. Because the wine had belonged to a Christian, al-Basasiri was able to obtain a Hanadi legal ruling (fatwƒÅ) declaring the vizier's actions illegal. Ibn al-Muslima then denounced him as having Shi'a sympathies and being in contact with the Abbasids' rivals, the Shi'a Fatimid Caliphate. He turned the Turkish troops and the caliph against him, and had his house in Baghdad burnt down. In fact, although the Fatimid chief missionary al-Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi wrote to al-Basasiri, his letters did not reach him until after the arrival of Tughrul in Baghdad. Ibn al-Muslima ordered the sultan al-Malik al-Rahim to send his favourite away, but the sultan refused. On 15 December 1055, the name of Tughrul, who was nominally passing through on his pilgrimage (·∏•ajj) to Mecca, was pronounced in the khu·π≠ba in Baghdad. On 18 December, he solemnly entered the city. The presence of his troops sparked disorders, and he arrested the Buwayhid sultan on 23 December for failing to control the people. Although al-Malik al-Rahim returned to Baghdad from WƒÅsi·π≠ to greet Tughrul, al-Basasiri went to the court of his brother-in-law, Dubays. Tughrul ordered Dubays to disassociate with al- Basasiri, and the latter went to Rahba. In Fatimid service against the Seljuks, 1055‚Äì59 =Governor of Rahba= From Rahba, al-Basasiri wrote to the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir () for permission to come to Cairo and for assistance in defending Syria and Egypt from the Seljuks. The Fatimid vizier al-Yazuri refused the first request, but granted the second. Al-Basasiri was appointed governor of Rahba, and the caliph sent him gold dinars, clothing valued at dinars, bows, swords, 500 horses and a quantity of lances and arrows. Al-Mu'ayyad accompanied the supplies and brought the letter of investiture. In 1056‚Äì57, al-Mu'ayyad won several Syrian and Iraqi emirs over to the Fatimid cause. Dubays, al-Basasiri's former protector, who had submitted to Tughrul, changed allegiance and had the Fatimid caliph's name pronounced in the khu·π≠ba. He renewed his alliance with al-Basasiri. The Baghdadi Turks, who had been a thorn in the side of al-Basasiri in previous years, found the rule of Tughrul intolerable and joined al-Basasiri in Syria. The army of al-Basasiri and Dubays, reinforced by the Turks and some Bedouin, marched on Sinjar, where they defeated a Seljuk force under Qutalmish and Quraysh. While Qutalmish escaped capture and fled to Adharbayjan, Quraysh was injured and surrendered on 9 January 1057. After his victory at Sinjar, al- Basasiri entered Mosul and the city declared for the Fatimid caliph. This situation only lasted a few days. Tughrul soon recaptured Mosul and set about devastating the region of Sinjar, while al-Basasiri retreated to Rahba. Dubays and Quraysh temporarily switched sides again, but the anti-Arab sentiment in the Seljuk camp repulsed them. Dubays went to Jami'an and Quraysh joined al- Basasiri at Rahba. In early 1058, Tughrul's brother Ibrahim Inal entered into an agreement with al-Basasiri and al-Mu'ayyad, whereby the latter would support him in usurping his brother's throne and he would proclaim the name of the Fatimid caliph in the khu·π≠ba. He abandoned Mosul to al-Basasiri, who still had to spend four months besieging the citadel before it surrendered. After capturing the citadel, al-Basasiri retired to Rahba. Again his victory did not last. Tughrul soon retook Mosul and marched on Nisibis. Al-Basasiri retreated to Damascus. =Conquest of Baghdad= During al-Basasiri's retreat, Ibrahim rose in revolt in the Jibal. Tughrul's response largely denuded Iraq of Seljuk troops, allowing al-Basasiri to launch an invasion. He quickly took Hit and Anbar. On 27 December 1058, he entered Baghdad with 400 maml≈´k cavalry accompanied by Quraysh and his 200 cavalry. The next Friday, 1 January 1059, the Shi'a call to worship (adhƒÅn) was announced in western Baghdad, which was predominantly Shi'a. On 8 January, al-Basasiri crossed the Tigris and occupied eastern Baghdad. The name of the Fatimid caliph was pronounced in the Great Mosque. There skirmishes in the streets throughout the following week. On 19 January, the Hasani Palace was assaulted and the Abbasid caliph al-Qa'im placed himself and his household under the protection of Quraysh. On 29 January, al-Basasiri celebrated the Feast of the Sacrifice in the prayer space (mu·π£allƒÅ) outside the Great Mosque with Fatimid banners flying. As the new authority in Baghdad, al-Basasiri took over the Abbasid insignia, the turban (mindƒ´l), cloak (ridƒÅ æ) and lattice screen (shibbƒÅk). He allowed Quraysh to retain custody of al-Qa'im, removed from the city and confined at Haditha, but he ordered him to hand over the vizier Ibn al-Muslima, whom he paraded through the streets and executed on 16 February 1059. Al-Basasiri followed up his conquest of Baghdad by taking Wasit and Basra. His invasion of Khuzistan, however, was repelled. The ruler of Khuzistan, Hazarasp ibn Bankir, asked Dubays to mediate with al-Basasiri. He offered to pay tribute to al-Basasiri, but the latter refused demanding that the khu·π≠ba and the coinage be made in the name of the Fatimid caliph. Hazarasp refused this. When al-Basasiri realised that he was receiving troops from Tughrul, he made peace with him and retired to Wasit, which he reached on the 12 September 1059. In July 1059, Tughrul defeated his brother. He offered to leave al-Basasiri in power in Baghdad provided the khu·π≠ba and the coinage were in his name and the Abbasid caliph was restored. Al-Basasiri tried to pry al-Qa'im away from the Seljuks, but the caliph refused. Quraysh tried to convince al-Basasiri to accept Tughrul's authority, but he refused. Tughrul marched on Baghdad. Al-Basasiri abandoned the city with his family on 14 December 1059. Tughrul and the Abbasid caliph entered it on 4 January 1060. The Fatimid name was said to have been pronounced in the khu·π≠ba in Baghdad's mosques forty times, meaning that the rule of al-Basasiri in Baghdad lasted forty Fridays. Al-Basasiri headed towards Kufa and joined up with Dubays. When the Seljuk cavalry overtook them, Dubays fled but al-Basasiri offered battle. On 15 January, at Sa·∏≥y al-Furat near Kufa, he was defeated and killed. His horse was first killed under him by an arrow and he was then killed by the clerk of the Seljuk vizier al-Kunduri. His head was brought to Tughrul at Baghdad.

History Signpost in Wansford Wansford station The Great North Road crossed the River Nene here by Wansford Old Bridge, now a Grade I listed building. The stone bridge replaced a wooden bridge with eight arches damaged by floods in 1571. The Great North Road was diverted to the east and the 1920s concrete brdge is itself Grade II*; it now carries the northbound carriageway of the A1. Wansford is under two parish councils. Wansford Parish Council, within the area of Peterborough City Council, comprises the village north of, and including, the Old Bridge. The village to the south of Wansford Old Bridge (The Haycock side) is represented by Sibson-cum-Stibbington Parish Council and comes under Huntingdonshire District Council. Wansford station is in Stibbington parish. There is a GP surgery, Wansford and Kings Cliffe Practice on Yarwell Road, to the north of the river. The village has a small post office store, a hairdressers and a private dental surgery. A new cafe bistro, The Wansford Lounge opened in 2017. It was split between two counties until 1965 when it came under one authority, (Huntingdon and Peterborough and, from 1974, Cambridgeshire). The boundary post between the Soke of Peterborough in Northamptonshire (the north side of the River Nene) and Huntingdonshire (the south bank) is still there halfway across the bridge.Wansford Bridge Hidden Heritage (retrieved 13 June 2011) On 2 May 2007 the helicopter of Phillip Carter, entrepreneur and owner of the Haycock Hotel, was found, crashed nearby in woods at Kings Cliffe. \\"Wansford-in-England\\" According to local folklore, related in Defoe's A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1724), the name Wansford-in-England comes from the tale of a local man who fell asleep on a hayrick and upon awakening found himself floating down the River Nene towards the sea. He asked a traveller on the riverbank where he was, and upon hearing the reply \\"Wansford\\", asked, \\"Wansford in England?\\". The name stuck and the Haycock Hotel takes its name from the legend. This version of the story seems to be derived by oral transmission from \\"Barnab√¶ Itinerarium, or Barnabee's Journal\\", an account of four long and often drunken journeys north through England published by Richard Brathwait in 1638 and reprinted in 1820, with extensive notes, by Joseph Haslewood. (Also known as Drunken Barnaby's Four Journeys to the North of England.) The hero, Barnaby, was allegedly born in Appleby-in-Westmorland, and his surname may have been Harrington (there was much discussion of the truth of these facts in prefaces to later editions - and indeed as to whether Barnaby had ever existed). The poem is written in elegant Latin verse with a parallel translation into English doggerel (only the English is given here). The references to Wansford are in the third journey, after Barnaby has visited Stilton and before he heads north to Stamford. As the second verse shows, he arrived when Wansford had been hit by the plague and the doors were marked with warnings. Architecture Wansford Parish Church The Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin is a Grade I listed building. Wansford railway station, 1.5 miles S.E. of the centre of the village, is the home of the Nene Valley Railway. The Haycock hotel, a coaching inn, is situated to the south of the stone bridge over the River Nene.

It is the northernmost Corbett on the island. The mountain forms the main part of a view known as The Sleeping Warrior due to its distinctive outline (resembling the profile of a recumbent figure) as seen from the mainland. The most notable feature of the mountain is Ceum na Caillich (often rendered as the \\"Witch's Step\\", cailleach, here in genitive also means an old woman/hag), a deep gash in the eastern ridge. It is the northernmost peak in a chain of three Corbetts: Goat Fell (the highest peak on Arran) is in fact an eastern outlier to this chain. The summit lies at the junction of four ridges: those running east, north and northwest eventually descend, whilst the southern ridge continues on to the central summit of the range, C√¨r Mh√≤r. The summit is crowned with a series of rocky tors, and in poor visibility it may be difficult to ascertain which one marks the highest point. The mountain is most frequently climbed from North Glenn Sannox. There is a car park on the A841 road west of Sannox. From here, the summit can be attained via the northern, northwestern or eastern ridge. Ascent over the eastern ridge requires the walker to negotiate Ceum na Caillich, a tricky scramble that is not easily by- passed. Ceum na Caillich and the eastern ridge may also be reached from the village of Sannox on the east coast of the island by way of Glen Sannox.

This included some significant early issues of Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, and a long, celebrated run on the character Thor in Journey into Mystery and The Mighty Thor.

Cover art by Colletta (signed) Colletta was born in Casteldaccia, Sicily, the son of Rosa and Frank Colletta, the latter \\"a pretty high-level Mafioso\\", according to family lore that said Frank Colletta emigrated from Sicily to escape local law enforcement. Colletta served with the US armed forces in World War II, where he provided art on the sides of bombers. He settled in Brooklyn, New York City, where his wife and child joined him 10 years later. The family then moved to New Jersey and opened an Italian market, severing any ties to the Mafia.Franklin Colletta in Educated at the New Jersey Academy of Fine Arts, Career Colletta entered comics in 1952, freelancing first as a penciler, inking his own work, for the publisher Better Publications, on the titles Intimate Love and Out of the Shadows, and for publisher Youthful Magazines' imprint Pix-Parade, on the title Daring Love. The following year he began his decades-long collaboration with Marvel, at the company's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics. Primarily a romance comics artist, he drew dozens of stories and covers for the Atlas titles Love Romances, Lovers, My Own Romance, Stories of Romance, and The Romances of Nurse Helen Grant, with his earliest confirmed Atlas romance art the six-page story \\"My Love for You\\" in Love Romances #37 (March 1954). Colletta's work also appeared in such genres as jungle adventure (Jungle Action, Jann of the Jungle, Lorna, the Jungle Girl) and horror/fantasy (Uncanny Tales, Journey into Mystery).Vince Colletta at AtlasTales.com During an Atlas retrenchment in the late 1950s, Colletta freelanced as a penciler on the DC Comics romance titles Falling in Love, Girls' Love Stories, and Heart Throbs, and Charlton Comics' Love Diary and Teen Confessions. His last confirmed pencil work for decades was \\"I Can't Marry Now\\" in Love Diary #6 (Sept. 1959). Colletta's first confirmed work as an inker of another artist's pencils is unknown, largely due to credits not being given routinely in 1950s comics. Two possibilities suggested by historians and researchers are the cover of Atlas' Annie Oakley Western Tales #10 (April 1956), co-inking with Sol Brodsky over Brodsky's pencils, and the three-page story \\"I Met My Love Again\\", penciled by Matt Baker, in My Own Romance #65 (Sept. 1958). Additionally assigned to ink stories in Atlas' emerging science- fiction/fantasy and giant-monster comics, Colletta entered what fans and historians call \\"pre-superhero Marvel\\" with three Baker-penciled stories: \\"The Green Fog\\" in Journey into Mystery #50 (Jan. 1959), \\"I Fell to the Center of the Earth\\" in Tales to Astonish #2 (March 1959), and \\"The Brain Picker\\" in World of Fantasy #17 (April 1959).

He inked Kirby's Fantastic Four #40-43, as well as Fantastic Four Annual #3, featuring the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm and guest-starring virtually all the major Marvel Comics characters of the time. Colletta began his six-year run on Kirby's \\"The Mighty Thor\\" feature with the \\"Tales of Asgard\\" backup in Journey into Mystery #106 (July 1964). Colletta graduated to the lead feature with #116 (May 1965). He continued through the book's retitling to The Mighty Thor with #126 (March 1966), and ‚Äî except for one issue (#143) ‚Äî inked it through #167 (Aug. 1969), picking up again from #176 (May 1970) to Kirby's final issue, #179 (Aug. 1970), inking John Buscema in #178. Colletta also inked Journey into Mystery Annual #1 (1965), which introduced Hercules to the Marvel universe, and The Mighty Thor King-Size Annual #2. Historians and critics consider Colletta's Thor work to be his creative highlight. Historian Nick Simon said, \\"For me, the Kirby/Colletta version of Thor is the definitive one.\\" Author and Silver Age of Comic Books historian Pierre Comtois wrote that, Colletta would also pencil stories in many 1960s issues of Charlton Comics' Teen-Age Love and First Kiss (at least some of which has been credited in reprints as by \\"Vince Colletta Studio\\"). He occasionally inked romance stories penciled by Joe Sinnott, and other pencilers on such titles as Charlton's Gunmaster, and Dell Comics' Guerrilla War, Jungle War Stories, and Western series Idaho. =DC Comics= Mister Miracle #3 (Aug. 1971). Art by Kirby & Colletta In 1970, Colletta ‚Äî who had been freelancing for DC Comics since 1968 on the romance titles Falling In Love, Girls' Love Stories, Secret Hearts and Young Romance ‚Äî stepped up his inking for the company following Jack Kirby's move there from Marvel Comics. Colletta inked Kirby's two black-and-white magazine one-shots, In the Days Of The Mob and Spirit World (both Oct. 1971), and the initial issues of Kirby‚Äôs Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen and \\"Fourth World\\" titles: The Forever People, Mister Miracle and The New Gods. While Colletta's rates were good and he brought \\"an innocent Marvel Age look to Jack's new heroes\\", he was prone to \\"erasing background characters\\" and transforming \\"[b]ustling crowd scenes [into] easier silhouettes\\".Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution (Bloomsbury, 2004) Kirby confidante Mark Evanier and inker Wally Wood eventually convinced a reluctant Kirby to ask DC Publisher Carmine Infantino to remove Colletta from inking Kirby's titles. He was replaced by inker Mike Royer, causing some fans to write to DC in complaint, denouncing Kirby for \\"abandoning the Marvel-style look\\". Colletta's frequent assistant Art Cappello did much of the background inking on these comics. Reprinted in Vince Colletta by Michael Netzer Colletta went on to ink a large array at DC, including a variety of Batman, Superman and Green Lantern titles; the TV tie-in series Isis and Super Friends; and nearly every issue of Wonder Woman from #206 (July 1973) to #270 (Aug. 1980), over pencilers including Don Heck, Dick Dillin, Curt Swan, Jos√© Delbo and Michael Netzer (Nasser). He was named DC's art director in May 1976, resigning the post in May 1979.DC Timeline 1976-1979 His time there included discovering future industry star Frank Miller. As one-time Marvel editor-in- chief Jim Shooter described, Miller had broken in with \\"a small job from Western Publishing, I think. Thus emboldened, he went to DC, and after getting savaged by Joe Orlando, got in to see art director Vinnie Colletta, who recognized talent and arranged for him to get a one-page war-comic job\\". Before and after his tenure, Colletta continued to do a small amount of inking for Marvel, as well as for Skywald Publications' black-and-white horror magazine Psycho. Well into the 1980s, Colletta continued to ink a wide assortment of comics for both DC and Marvel. His last known credit is a Marvel humor one-shot, Fred Hembeck Destroys the Marvel Universe (July 1989). In late 1987 after editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was fired from Marvel, Colletta sent Marvel a scathing, profanity-laced letter highly critical of the company's action, which became widely circulated. Analysis Colletta was regarded as one of the American comics industry's fastest inkers and a reliable professional to call upon when a comic was in danger of missing a printing deadline. He nonetheless has been criticized by a range of fellow professionals and comic historians for erasing various details in a penciler's work, both in order to lessen the inking burden and to help meet time constraints during an industry era when printers charged then-prohibitive thousands of dollars for missed deadlines, which resulted in idle presses.The magazine The Jack Kirby Collector #14 (Feb. 1997), for example, ran the point- counterpoint article \\"The Pros & Cons of Vince Colletta\\", by Tony Seybert and John Morrow, reprinted in The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume Three (TwoMorrows, 2004) As comics artist Joe Sinnott told author Marc Flores, who writes under the pen name Ronin Ro, \\"When I penciled the romance stories, I used to tell myself, Vince wrecked what I did. ... He would eliminate people from the strip and use silhouettes, everything to cut corners and make the work easier for himself.\\" Writer Len Wein told an interviewer what he enjoyed most about working on Luke Cage was, \\"Getting to work with the wonderful George Tuska, before Vinnie Colletta got his hands on the pencils and ruined them\\". Colletta was reassigned from inking The Tomb of Dracula when publisher Stan Lee determined Colletta had taken unacceptable shortcuts on issue #9. Gene Colan, penciler on the series (and on several earlier projects inked by Colletta), remarked many years later that \\"when he wanted to he could do very good work, but he didn't take his time with my stuff.\\"Field, p. 88 Jack Kirby partisans are particularly vocal. Mark Evanier said, \\"In 1970 when Steve Sherman and I met Steve Ditko, he asked us about the new Kirby books that were then about to debut at DC. When we told him Colletta was handling the inking, he winced and said that he would probably not look at the comics. Back when he was working for Marvel, Ditko said he'd pick up the latest issues in the office and always check the credits before taking the comics home. If he found Colletta's name ‚Äî especially as Kirby's embellisher ‚Äî he would make a point of putting the comic back, or even in a wastebasket. And he'd make sure Stan [Lee] saw what he was doing and knew the reason why.\\"Evanier, Mark. The Jack Kirby Collector (date not given), reprinted in NeilAlien.com, September 8, 2005. WebCitation archive. Conversely, Colletta's admirers point to the speed with which Colletta was often required to work, and the results he could produce when given time. Critic Tony Seybert wrote that \\"for tales set in the distant past of myth and legend, Colletta's soft delicate inks evoke the vapors of ancient times [and are] just as effective on Asgardian crags as on the sylvan glades of Olympus. The Kirby/Colletta Thor is a mighty blond deity with a hint of Norse faerie-dust. Hercules is a roughly hewn sculpture, almost incomplete, like one of the unfinished prisoners of Michelangelo.\\"Seybert, Tony, The Jack Kirby Collector #14 Colletta himself has described his methods as a necessity of the industry. When asked to describe his philosophy of inking, he said, \\"Well, first of all, some inkers like to pick and choose... and they'll take their time, no matter what the deadline is, even if the editor is in a jam, or a colorist is waiting for pages to come in so they can earn a living, too. I can't be that way.\\"Colletta interview with Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\", Marvel Comics cover-dated May 1983, including The New Mutants #3 (May 1983). Personal life By the early 1950s, Colletta was married to his wife, Viola. The couple had a son, Franklin. Circa 1962, the family began living at 3 Old Woods Road, in Saddle River, New Jersey.Bryant, p. 17 Some time after having recovered from a heart attack, Colletta was diagnosed with cancer; three weeks later, on June 3, 1991, aged 67, he died at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, New Jersey.Bryant, p. 115 At least one obituary, in The Comics Journal, erroneously stated he died at age 65 and in \\"late June\\", and claimed the cause was heart disease.

In 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in 1086 and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value. Chesterton was listed in the Domesday Book in the Hundred of Normancross in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as Cestretune in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there were two manors at Chesterton; the annual rent paid to the lords of the manors in 1066 had been ¬£8 and the rent had fallen to ¬£6 in 1086. The Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there was 21 households at Chesterton. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5.0 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Chesterton in 1086 is that it was within the range of 73 and 105 people. The Domesday Book uses a number of units of measure for areas of land that are now unfamiliar terms, such as hides and ploughlands. In different parts of the country, these were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to ; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as ¬£1 for tax purposes. The survey records that there were nine ploughlands at Chesterton in 1086 and that there was the capacity for a further five ploughlands. In addition to the arable land, there was of meadows at Chesterton. The tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England, and was only levied when necessary. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manors at Chesterton the total tax assessed was nine geld. By 1086 there was already a church and a priest at Chesterton. In 1933 Chesterton had electricity. However piped water was not installed into the village until 1939, which meant villagers had to use water from the local Billing Brook. This eventually led to a sewage system being completed in 1969. Government Chesterton does not have a parish council but has an annual parish meeting. Chesterton was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Chesterton became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire. The second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council which is a non- metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire and has its headquarters in Huntingdon. Huntingdonshire District Council has 52 councillors representing 29 district wards. Huntingdonshire District Council collects the council tax, and provides services such as building regulations, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Chesterton is a part of the district ward of Elton and Folksworth and is represented on the district council by one councillor. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council. For Chesterton the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services. Cambridgeshire County Council consists of 69 councillors representing 60 electoral divisions. Chesterton is part of the electoral division of Norman Cross and is represented on the county council by two councillors. At Westminster Chesterton is in the parliamentary constituency of North West Cambridgeshire, and elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Chesterton is represented in the House of Commons by Shailesh Vara (Conservative). Shailesh Vara has represented the constituency since 2005. The previous member of parliament was Brian Mawhinney (Conservative) who represented the constituency between 1997 and 2005. Demography The occupational data of Chesterton in 1881, shown in the graph to the right, presents the majority of females as not having a \\" Specified Occupation\\". Compare this to the side which presents data for the male population in Chesterton in 1881, it presents all of the males within the village being in some sort of recognised occupation. Occupational Data of 1881 for Chesterton According to the 2011 Census, Chesterton (including Haddon) had a population of 317, with their main industry being in the Wholesale and Retail Trade. Compare this to the Chesterton of 1831, where the population was only 105 and 66% of the industry in Chesterton was in the agricultural industry. In 2011, the total number of households in Chesterton was 139. This compared to the number of households in the village in 1831, which was 21 households shows clear signs of development in the village to increase the number of households. The population density in Chesterton was measured at 0.2 (Numbers of people per hectare) in the 2011 Census. This is seen to be drastically under the national average in England which is 4.1 ( Numbers of people per hectare). Also in Chesterton, the percentage of people who stated their religion as Christian in the 2011 Census was also higher than the national average, with the percentage of the population who were Christians in Chesterton at 75.7% and the national average in England being 59.4%. Education Chesterton has no schools in the village itself. However it has several schools located within the local area. It has 2 primary schools located within a radius 1.5 miles from the village. These schools are Orton Wistow Primary School and Matley Primary School. Both these schools are for children aged 4‚Äì11 years old. An Ofsted report in 2011 gave Orton Wistow primary school a rating of \\"Good.\\" An Ofsted report in 2013 for Matley Primary school rated the school as \\"Requires Improvement.\\" The nearest secondary school is located 1.4 miles away from the village and is called Ormiston Bushfield Academy. The school is for children aged 11‚Äì 19 years old. An Ofsted report in May 2012 rated the school as \\"Good\\" Religious sites The Church of St Michael Chesterton ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 265404 St Michael's church, which is located on the north side of the village dates back to the 13th Century and has monuments of the Lord of the Chesterton Manor, which belonged to the Beville family. Also St Michael's is where the tomb of William Beville who died in 1487 is located. The Beville family built Chesterton manor in the 1600s with Robert Beville building the manor, However the family acquired the land in which the manor was built in 1378 after \\"the Norman Conquest\\" and the marriage of John Beville and Agnes Walderchef, until the manor was passed on to the Dryden family at a later date. From 1927‚Äì37 the Rev Frank Buttle was rector of Chesterton with Haddon and Alwalton.

Fagin the Jew is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Will Eisner. In this book, Eisner retells the story of Fagin from Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist from Fagin's point of view. Eisner portrays Fagin as a distressed and complex character, and tells the story of his life and his place in the Ashkenazic community of London in the first person, with many illustrations. The book was written in response to Eisner's belief that much classic literature contains anti-Semitic stereotypes, including Dickens's portrayal of Fagin. Eisner has cast the story in the form of an interview between Fagin and Dickens, on the night before Fagin is to be hanged, in which Fagin tells his life story and pleads for a more understanding portrayal by Dickens.

The first VASCAR device was created in 1966 by Arthur Marshall. It is used by police officers to enforce speed limits, and may be preferred where radar or lidar is illegal, such as some jurisdictions in Pennsylvania, or to prevent detection by those with radar detectors. Operation A VASCAR unit couples a stopwatch with a simple computer. An operator records the moment that a vehicle passes two fixed objects (such as a white circle or square painted on the road) that are a known distance apart. The vehicle's average speed is then calculated by dividing the distance by the time. By applying the mean value theorem, the operator can deduce that the vehicle's speed must be at least equal to its average speed at some time between the measurements. VASCAR can be used from a moving or stationary patrol vehicle, and the target vehicle may be travelling in the same direction, in front of or behind the officer. It can be approaching from the front, or even on an intersecting highway. This technique can also be used to determine a vehicle's speed from helicopters and other aerial platforms, making it easier to secure a conviction. A 1991 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that VASCAR-plus units produced errors of less than 2 mph if used correctly. Users VASCAR is known to be used where radar or LIDAR is illegal, such as some jurisdictions in Pennsylvania. Many police vehicles in the United Kingdom are fitted with a device, especially those used for traffic enforcement. The system is also used by airborne units - in some remote locations of the United States airborne speed enforcement is employed regularly. History VASCAR was invented by Arthur Marshall, a real-estate investor living in Richmond, Virginia in 1966. He was inspired to create the device after watching a police car driving dangerously trying to pace a speeder. The original version of the device was entirely mechanical, using a governed motor and a gear system to move a pointer to the correct speed value. Subsequent versions used a microprocessor to perform the speed calculations. By 1968, the device was in use in North Carolina, Indiana, Kentucky, and New York. In 1971, Marshall formed a company, Traffic Safety Systems, Inc., to market the device. After his death, Traffic Safety Systems was purchased by Power Systems & Controls, Inc., which had long manufactured the devices. They continue to produce similar devices under the name VASCAR- plus. Technical Specifics VASCAR relies on the accuracy of the patrol vehicle's speedometer drive (generally located within the vehicle transmission) for determining the distance traveled, using an odometer within the VASCAR system itself. Recently-purchased law enforcement vehicles generally have electronic speedometers, and a sensor wire is connected to the speed-sensor feed wire to count the pulses from the drive. Older vehicles, with cable-driven speedometers, are connected to the VASCAR unit with a mechanical-optical adapter which attaches to the cable. Pulses are counted the same way for both input methods. The time and distance registers are completely separate from each other, and each is controlled by a toggle switch, which is operated by the traffic officer. To clock the patrol vehicle's speed (for instance, when the speed is matched with the violator's vehicle), both switches are operated simultaneously. Most often, however, the TIME toggle is activated when the violator's vehicle passes an identifiable landmark (such as a signpost), and the DISTANCE toggle is activated when the patrol vehicle passes the same landmark. When the violator passes a second landmark, the timer is stopped, and when the patrol vehicle passes that landmark, the distance measurement stops. These two values are then compared by the digital computer, which displays the average speed over that distance. Early VASCAR units were made up of three parts. The main computer section was a box which was installed in a trunk or under a seat, the odometer drive was installed under the vehicle dashboard, and the control unit was mounted in a convenient operating location. Later systems combined the control and computer sections into a single unit, and replaced the earlier Nixie tube displays with LEDs. Some VASCAR systems have included the ability to set a specific distance, allowing a traffic officer to avoid having to measure each time that stretch of road was checked. It is also possible to retain an earlier measurement, to be used with multiple vehicles (for instance, when spending a morning enforcing speed in a school zone). Until a new distance is put into the system memory, all speeds will be calculated based on the previous distance information. Strengths and weaknesses of VASCAR The VASCAR system has one major advantage over the RADAR and LIDAR systems also used for determining speed, in that it is not necessary to be in (or close to) the line of travel of the target vehicle. RADAR and LIDAR clock speed using the Doppler effect, so a vehicle traveling at an angle in relation to the unit will have a lower speed reading than actual speed. VASCAR, however, can provide an accurate speed clock under any conditions in which both a start and a stop point can be identified. It is not even necessary to see the entire course over which the target vehicle travels, so long as that specific vehicle can be identified as it passes the start and end points. The greater the distance (to the limit of the device), the more accurate the average speed. The primary weakness of VASCAR is that it can only provide an average speed, in contrast to the near-instant speed readout of a Doppler-effect system. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to be well above the speed limit, then slow to the same amount below the limit for the same period of time, and have a legal speed. A secondary weakness is that the operator must be able to visually identify the target vehicle and both start and end points, as well as operating the switches at the precise moments necessary. \\"Cheating\\" by traffic officers using VASCAR As with any method used for determining speed, VASCAR is not immune to cheating by operators. Cheating is only useful if the operator intends to show the speed readout to the supposed violator or another interested party as \\"proof\\" of the result. The system relies completely on the operator's inputs, so it is possible for a traffic officer to get a desired output, either by cutting off the elapsed time clock early, or by letting the distance counter run longer. Of course, it is not actually necessary for the operator to track the vehicle, and an experienced operator can work the switches until a desired speed is shown, then save that display until an appropriate vehicle comes along. Similar devices While the name VASCAR is no longer trademarked, VASCAR and VASCAR V PLUS are trademarked in South Africa by Signal Systems (Pty) Limited. Power Systems & Controls holds the trademark to VASCAR-plus. Other companies sell similar, though non-VASCAR- branded, systems. For example, under the category \\"electronic speed timing devices (nonradar), which calculate average speed between any two points\\", the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation authorizes two devices in addition to the various VASCAR-plus models: the Tracker, by PATCO, and the V-SPEC, by YIS/Cowden Group.

The protein possesses tyrosine kinase activity. The primary single chain precursor protein is post-translationally cleaved to produce the alpha and beta subunits, which are disulfide linked to form the mature receptor. MET is a single pass tyrosine kinase receptor essential for embryonic development, organogenesis and wound healing. Hepatocyte growth factor/Scatter Factor (HGF/SF) and its splicing isoform (NK1, NK2) are the only known ligands of the MET receptor. MET is normally expressed by cells of epithelial origin, while expression of HGF/SF is restricted to cells of mesenchymal origin. When HGF/SF binds its cognate receptor MET it induces its dimerization through a not yet completely understood mechanism leading to its activation. Abnormal MET activation in cancer correlates with poor prognosis, where aberrantly active MET triggers tumor growth, formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that supply the tumor with nutrients, and cancer spread to other organs (metastasis). MET is deregulated in many types of human malignancies, including cancers of kidney, liver, stomach, breast, and brain. Normally, only stem cells and progenitor cells express MET, which allows these cells to grow invasively in order to generate new tissues in an embryo or regenerate damaged tissues in an adult. However, cancer stem cells are thought to hijack the ability of normal stem cells to express MET, and thus become the cause of cancer persistence and spread to other sites in the body. Both the overexpression of Met/HGFR, as well as its autocrine activation by co- expression of its hepatocyte growth factor ligand, have been implicated in oncogenesis. Various mutations in the MET gene are associated with papillary renal carcinoma.  Gene  MET proto-oncogene (GeneID: 4233) has a total length of 125,982 bp, and it is located in the 7q31 locus of chromosome 7. MET is transcribed into a 6,641 bp mature mRNA, which is then translated into a 1,390 amino-acid MET protein.  Protein  Schematic structure of MET protein MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is produced as a single- chain precursor. The precursor is proteolytically cleaved at a furin site to yield a highly glycosylated extracellular Œ±-subunit and a transmembrane Œ≤-subunit, which are linked together by a disulfide bridge. = Extracellular = * Region of homology to semaphorins (Sema domain), which includes the full Œ±-chain and the N-terminal part of the Œ≤-chain * Cysteine-rich MET-related sequence (MRS domain) * Glycine-proline-rich repeats (G-P repeats) * Four immunoglobulin-like structures (Ig domains), a typical protein-protein interaction region. = Intracellular = A Juxtamembrane segment that contains: * a serine residue (Ser 985), which inhibits the receptor kinase activity upon phosphorylation * a tyrosine (Tyr 1003), which is responsible for MET polyubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation upon interaction with the ubiquitin ligase CBL * Tyrosine kinase domain, which mediates MET biological activity. Following MET activation, transphosphorylation occurs on Tyr 1234 and Tyr 1235 * C-terminal region contains two crucial tyrosines (Tyr 1349 and Tyr 1356), which are inserted into the multisubstrate docking site, capable of recruiting downstream adapter proteins with Src homology-2 (SH2) domains. The two tyrosines of the docking site have been reported to be necessary and sufficient for the signal transduction both in vitro.  MET signaling pathway  MET signaling complex MET activation by its ligand HGF induces MET kinase catalytic activity, which triggers transphosphorylation of the tyrosines Tyr 1234 and Tyr 1235. These two tyrosines engage various signal transducers, thus initiating a whole spectrum of biological activities driven by MET, collectively known as the invasive growth program. The transducers interact with the intracellular multisubstrate docking site of MET either directly, such as GRB2, SHC, SRC, and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), or indirectly through the scaffolding protein Gab1 Tyr 1349 and Tyr 1356 of the multisubstrate docking site are both involved in the interaction with GAB1, SRC, and SHC, while only Tyr 1356 is involved in the recruitment of GRB2, phospholipase C Œ≥ (PLC-Œ≥), p85, and SHP2. GAB1 is a key coordinator of the cellular responses to MET and binds the MET intracellular region with high avidity, but low affinity. Upon interaction with MET, GAB1 becomes phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues which, in turn, recruit a number of signalling effectors, including PI3K, SHP2, and PLC-Œ≥. GAB1 phosphorylation by MET results in a sustained signal that mediates most of the downstream signaling pathways. =Activation of signal transduction= MET engagement activates multiple signal transduction pathways: * The RAS pathway mediates HGF-induced scattering and proliferation signals, which lead to branching morphogenesis. Of note, HGF, differently from most mitogens, induces sustained RAS activation, and thus prolonged MAPK activity. * The PI3K pathway is activated in two ways: PI3K can be either downstream of RAS, or it can be recruited directly through the multifunctional docking site. Activation of the PI3K pathway is currently associated with cell motility through remodeling of adhesion to the extracellular matrix as well as localized recruitment of transducers involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, such as RAC1 and PAK. PI3K activation also triggers a survival signal due to activation of the AKT pathway. * The STAT pathway, together with the sustained MAPK activation, is necessary for the HGF-induced branching morphogenesis. MET activates the STAT3 transcription factor directly, through an SH2 domain. * The beta-catenin pathway, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, translocates into the nucleus following MET activation and participates in transcriptional regulation of numerous genes. * The Notch pathway, through transcriptional activation of Delta ligand (see DLL3). Interplay between MET, beta catenin, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways  Role in development  MET mediates a complex program known as invasive growth. Activation of MET triggers mitogenesis, and morphogenesis. During embryonic development, transformation of the flat, two-layer germinal disc into a three-dimensional body depends on transition of some cells from an epithelial phenotype to spindle-shaped cells with motile behaviour, a mesenchymal phenotype. This process is referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Later in embryonic development, MET is crucial for gastrulation, angiogenesis, myoblast migration, bone remodeling, and nerve sprouting among others. MET is essential for embryogenesis, because MET ‚àí/‚àí mice die in utero due to severe defects in placental development. Along with Ectodysplasin A, it has been shown to be involved in the differentiation of anatomical placodes, precursors of scales, feathers and hair follicles in vertebrates. Furthermore, MET is required for such critical processes as liver regeneration and wound healing during adulthood. HGF/MET axis is also involved in myocardial development. Both HGF and MET receptor mRNAs are co-expressed in cardiomyocytes from E7.5, soon after the heart has been determined, to E9.5. Transcripts for HGF ligand and receptor are first detected before the occurrence of cardiac beating and looping, and persist throughout the looping stage, when heart morphology begins to elaborate. In avian studies, HGF was found in the myocardial layer of the atrioventricular canal, in a developmental stage in which the epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of the endocardial cushion occurs. However, MET is not essential for heart development, since Œ±-MHCMet-KO mice show normal heart development. Expression = Tissue distribution = MET is normally expressed by epithelial cells. However, MET is also found on endothelial cells, neurons, hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, melanocytes and neonatal cardiomyocytes. HGF expression is restricted to cells of mesenchymal origin. = Transcriptional control = MET transcription is activated by HGF and several growth factors. MET promoter has four putative binding sites for Ets, a family of transcription factors that control several invasive growth genes. ETS1 activates MET transcription in vitro. MET transcription is activated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), which is activated by low concentration of intracellular oxygen. HIF1 can bind to one of the several hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the MET promoter. Hypoxia also activates transcription factor AP-1, which is involved in MET transcription.  Clinical significance  = Role in cancer = MET pathway plays an important role in the development of cancer through: * activation of key oncogenic pathways (RAS, PI3K, STAT3, beta-catenin); * angiogenesis (sprouting of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones to supply a tumor with nutrients); * scatter (cells dissociation due to metalloprotease production), which often leads to metastasis. Coordinated down-regulation of both MET and its downstream effector extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) by miR-199a* may be effective in inhibiting not only cell proliferation but also motility and invasive capabilities of tumor cells. MET amplification has emerged as a potential biomarker of the clear cell tumor subtype. The amplification of the cell surface receptor MET often drives resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer. = Role in autism = The SFARIgene database lists MET with an autism score of 2.0, which indicates that it is a strong candidate for playing a role in cases of autism. The database also identifies at least one study that found a role for MET in cases of schizophrenia. The gene was first implicated in autism in a study that identified a polymorphism in the promoter of the MET gene. The polymorphism reduces transcription by 50%. Further, the variant as an autism risk polymorphism has been replicated, and shown to be enriched in children with autism and gastrointestinal disturbances. A rare mutation has been found that appears in two family members, one with autism and the other with a social and communication disorder. The role of the receptor in brain development is distinct from its role in other developmental processes. Activation of the MET receptor regulates synapse formation and can impact the development and function of circuits involved in social and emotional behavior. = Role in heart function = In adult mice, MET is required to protect cardiomyocytes by preventing age-related oxidative stress, apoptosis, fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, MET inhibitors, such as Crizotinib or PF-04254644, have been tested by short-term treatments in cellular and preclinical models, and have been shown to induce cardiomyocytes death through ROS production, activation of caspases, metabolism alteration and blockage of ion channels. In the injured heart, HGF/MET axis plays important roles in cardioprotection by promoting pro-survival (anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic) effects in cardiomyocytes, angiogenesis, inhibition of fibrosis, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory signals, and regeneration through activation of cardiac stem cells.  Interaction with tumour suppressor genes  = PTEN = PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a protein PTEN, which possesses lipid and protein phosphatase-dependent as well as phosphatase-independent activities. PTEN protein phosphatase is able to interfere with MET signaling by dephosphorylating either PIP3 generated by PI3K, or the p52 isoform of SHC. SHC dephosphorylation inhibits recruitment of the GRB2 adapter to activated MET. = VHL = There is evidence of correlation between inactivation of VHL tumor suppressor gene and increased MET signaling in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and also in malignant transformations of the heart.  Cancer therapies targeting HGF/MET  Strategies to inhibit biological activity of MET Since tumor invasion and metastasis are the main cause of death in cancer patients, interfering with MET signaling appears to be a promising therapeutic approach. A comprehensive list of HGF and MET targeted experimental therapeutics for oncology now in human clinical trials can be found here. = MET kinase inhibitors = Kinase inhibitors are low molecular weight molecules that prevent ATP binding to MET, thus inhibiting receptor transphosphorylation and recruitment of the downstream effectors. The limitations of kinase inhibitors include the facts that they only inhibit kinase-dependent MET activation, and that none of them is fully specific for MET. * K252a (Fermentek Biotechnology) is a staurosporine analogue isolated from Nocardiopsis sp. soil fungi, and it is a potent inhibitor of all receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). At nanomolar concentrations, K252a inhibits both the wild type and the mutant (M1268T) MET function. * SU11274 (SUGEN) specifically inhibits MET kinase activity and its subsequent signaling. SU11274 is also an effective inhibitor of the M1268T and H1112Y MET mutants, but not the L1213V and Y1248H mutants. SU11274 has been demonstrated to inhibit HGF-induced motility and invasion of epithelial and carcinoma cells. * PHA-665752 (Pfizer) specifically inhibits MET kinase activity, and it has been demonstrated to represses both HGF-dependent and constitutive MET phosphorylation. Furthermore, some tumors harboring MET amplifications are highly sensitive to treatment with PHA-665752. * ARQ197 (ArQule) is a promising selective inhibitor of MET, which entered a phase 2 clinical trial in 2008. (Failed a phase 3 in 2017) * Foretinib (XL880, Exelixis) targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with growth- promoting and angiogenic properties. The primary targets of foretinib are MET, VEGFR2, and KDR. Foretinib has completed a phase 2 clinical trials with indications for papillary renal cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and head and neck cancer.Poster * SGX523 (SGX Pharmaceuticals) specifically inhibits MET at low nanomolar concentrations. * MP470 (SuperGen) is a novel inhibitor of c-KIT, MET, PDGFR, Flt3, and AXL. Phase I clinical trial of MP470 had been announced in 2007. = HGF inhibitors = Since HGF is the only known ligand of MET, blocking the formation of a HGF:MET complex blocks MET biological activity. For this purpose, truncated HGF, anti-HGF neutralizing antibodies, and an uncleavable form of HGF have been utilized so far. The major limitation of HGF inhibitors is that they block only HGF-dependent MET activation. * NK4 competes with HGF as it binds MET without inducing receptor activation, thus behaving as a full antagonist. NK4 is a molecule bearing the N-terminal hairpin and the four kringle domains of HGF. Moreover, NK4 is structurally similar to angiostatins, which is why it possesses anti-angiogenic activity. * Neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies were initially tested in combination, and it was shown that at least three antibodies, acting on different HGF epitopes, are necessary to prevent MET tyrosine kinase activation. More recently, it has been demonstrated that fully human monoclonal antibodies can individually bind and neutralize human HGF, leading to regression of tumors in mouse models. Two anti-HGF antibodies are currently available: the humanized AV299 (AVEO), and the fully human AMG102 (Amgen). * Uncleavable HGF is an engineered form of pro-HGF carrying a single amino-acid substitution, which prevents the maturation of the molecule. Uncleavable HGF is capable of blocking MET-induced biological responses by binding MET with high affinity and displacing mature HGF. Moreover, uncleavable HGF competes with the wild-type endogenous pro-HGF for the catalytic domain of proteases that cleave HGF precursors. Local and systemic expression of uncleavable HGF inhibits tumor growth and, more importantly, prevents metastasis. = Decoy MET = Decoy MET refers to a soluble truncated MET receptor. Decoys are able to inhibit MET activation mediated by both HGF-dependent and independent mechanisms, as decoys prevent both the ligand binding and the MET receptor homodimerization. CGEN241 (Compugen) is a decoy MET that is highly efficient in inhibiting tumor growth and preventing metastasis in animal models. = Immunotherapy targeting MET = Drugs used for immunotherapy can act either passively by enhancing the immunologic response to MET-expressing tumor cells, or actively by stimulating immune cells and altering differentiation/growth of tumor cells.  Passive immunotherapy  Administering monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a form of passive immunotherapy. MAbs facilitate destruction of tumor cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In CDC, mAbs bind to specific antigen, leading to activation of the complement cascade, which in turn leads to formation of pores in tumor cells. In ADCC, the Fab domain of a mAb binds to a tumor antigen, and Fc domain binds to Fc receptors present on effector cells (phagocytes and NK cells), thus forming a bridge between an effector and a target cells. This induces the effector cell activation, leading to phagocytosis of the tumor cell by neutrophils and macrophages. Furthermore, NK cells release cytotoxic molecules, which lyse tumor cells. * DN30 is monoclonal anti-MET antibody that recognizes the extracellular portion of MET. DN30 induces both shedding of the MET ectodomain as well as cleavage of the intracellular domain, which is successively degraded by proteasome machinery. As a consequence, on one side MET is inactivated, and on the other side the shed portion of extracellular MET hampers activation of other MET receptors, acting as a decoy. DN30 inhibits tumour growth and prevents metastasis in animal models. * OA-5D5 is one-armed monoclonal anti-MET antibody that was demonstrated to inhibit orthotopic pancreatic and glioblastoma tumor growth and to improve survival in tumor xenograft models. OA-5D5 is produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. It is composed of murine variable domains for the heavy and light chains with human IgG1 constant domains. The antibody blocks HGF binding to MET in a competitive fashion.  Active immunotherapy  Active immunotherapy to MET-expressing tumors can be achieved by administering cytokines, such as interferons (IFNs) and interleukins (IL-2), which triggers non-specific stimulation of numerous immune cells.

Software directly sets and samples the states of GPIOs (e.g., pins on a microcontroller), and is responsible for meeting all timing requirements and protocol sequencing of the signals. In contrast to bit banging, dedicated hardware (e.g., UART, SPI interface) satisfies these requirements and, if necessary, provides a data buffer to relax software timing requirements. Bit banging can be implemented at very low cost, and is commonly used in embedded systems. Bit banging allows a device to implement different protocols with minimal or no hardware changes. In some cases, bit banging is made feasible by newer, faster processors because more recent hardware operates much more quickly than hardware did when standard communications protocols were created. C code example The following C language code example transmits a byte of data on an SPI bus. // transmit byte serially, MSB first void send_8bit_serial_data(unsigned char data) { int i; // select device (active low) output_low(SD_CS); // send bits 7..0 for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) { // consider leftmost bit // set line high if bit is 1, low if bit is 0 if (data & 0x80) output_high(SD_DI); else output_low(SD_DI); // pulse the clock state to indicate that bit value should be read output_low(SD_CLK); delay(); output_high(SD_CLK); // shift byte left so next bit will be leftmost data <<= 1; } // deselect device output_high(SD_CS); } Considerations The question whether to deploy bit banging or not is a trade-off between load, performance and reliability on the one hand, and the availability of a hardware alternative on the other. The software emulation process consumes more processing power than does supporting dedicated hardware. The microcontroller spends much of its time sending or receiving samples to and from the pins, at the expense of other tasks. The signal produced usually has more jitter or glitches, especially if the processor is also executing other tasks while communicating. However, if the bit-banging software is interrupt-driven by the signal, this may be of minor importance, especially if control signals such as RTS, CTS, or DCD are available. The implementation in software can be a solution when specific hardware support is not available or requires a more expensive microcontroller.

Bridgewater- Raritan High School was opened in September 1959, with Norman A. Gathany serving as the school's first principal. Increasing enrollments in the early 1960s led to the construction of a second high school in 1966, which was named Bridgewater-Raritan High School East (the Minutemen), while the original high school was renamed Bridgewater-Raritan High School West (the Golden Falcons).Strauss, Robert A. Referendum, p. 21 ff. Accessed September 4, 2019. \\"Finally, finally, that day came in the beginning of September 1959. The doors of our not-yet-completed high had opened for business.... By 1966, the Bridgewater-Raritan High School was now overflowing, and the school district had to add another high school to its roster.... The original high school now was called High School West, and the new school was High School East.\\" Declining enrollments led to their consolidation into a single high school during the 1990s. The former High School West was expanded and updated over a period of several years, during which all of the district's high school students attended what had been High School East. In 1995, the former High School West reopened as the new consolidated Bridgewater-Raritan High School, and High School East became the district's Middle School. The mascot of BRHS is the panther. BRHS's school colors are black and silver, with red serving as an accent color. The red in uniforms of the past has been mostly replaced by black, white and silver. The football, baseball, boys lacrosse, girls basketball, and various other teams have eliminated red from their uniforms. A minority of teams, including boys basketball and boys cross country, have continued use of red as an accent color. The uniforms for the marching band are black and red with silver buttons and helmets.

Early life and education Samuel Bell was born on February 9, 1770, in Londonderry, New Hampshire, to John and Mary Ann (Gilmore) Bell. Until he was eighteen, Bell worked on his father's farm, and was educated at common schools during winter seasons. Wishing to undertake higher education, Bell began studying Latin in April 1788, and later enrolled at the New Ipswich Academy. From October 1790 to April 1791, he was a teacher in Londonderry, and in the May following entered the sophomore class at Dartmouth College. Graduating in 1793, Bell proceeded to study law and was admitted to the Hillsborough bar in September 1796, after which he worked as a lawyer in Francestown, New Hampshire. Career = Early career = Bell first entered politics when he became a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1804; he was re- elected in the two following years, during both he was the Speaker of the House. In 1806, he became the President of The Bank of Hillsborough, but by the end of his tenure in that position in 1810, it was the only New Hampshire bank to fail between 1792 and 1840. Bell was offered to become the New Hampshire Attorney General in 1807, but declined because he felt the salary was too small. He was a member of the New Hampshire Senate from 1807 to 1809, and was the President of that body during those two years, and from 1809 to 1811 was in the Executive Council of New Hampshire. Bell was appointed to be the trustee of Dartmouth College from 1808 to 1811. However, in 1809, due to a severe lung problem which showed the signs of tuberculosis, he was advised by his doctors to take an extended vacation away from the practice of law and to travel, which he did according to The American Quarterly Review; also according to this source, Bell spent parts of several following years traveling to relatively distant areas, primarily on horseback, which gradually recovered his health. However, the Biographical Director of the Library of Congress says that Bell continued practicing law between 1810 and 1812, moving to Amherst in 1810 and to Chester at those respective times. =State Supreme Court and Governor of New Hampshire= In 1816, Bell was elevated to the New Hampshire Supreme Court as an associate justice, but resigned in 1819 to become Governor of New Hampshire on June 3, 1819, as a Democratic-Republican In the election for the governorship that year, Bell had secured 13,751 of 24,265 votes. He would be re-elected in 1820, 1821, and 1822; in 1822, he gained 22,934 out of 23,980 votes cast, which was the largest share of votes cast for a governor candidate of New Hampshire since John Taylor Gilman's victory in 1795. In all re-election campaigns, Bell faced token opposition. Whilst governor, crime within the state was reduced, and New Hampshire's industry was promoted and developed. In June 1822, Bell declined to run again for governor, and he left the governorship on June 4, 1823. =United States Senate and later life= On March 4, 1823, Bell was elected to the United States Senate as an Adams-Clay Republican; by the end of his service in the Senate on March 3, 1835, he would be affiliated with the Adams Party, the Anti-Jacksonian Party, and in 1834 the Whig Party. He was re-elected in 1829, and during the 23rd United States Congress, Bell was the chairman of the Committee on Claims. After he left the Senate, Bell retired from public life, and retreated to a farm in Chester that he had purchased in 1813. He spent his later years cultivating his farm, and died on December 23, 1850 in Chester, and was interned in the Village Cemetery. Personal life In November 1797, Bell married Mehitable Bowen Dana, and together they would have six children; four sons: Samuel, John, James and Luther; two daughters: Mary-Anne, and another who died in infancy. In August 1810, Dana died, and in July 1828, Bell married Lucy G. Smith, with whom he would have four sons. In 1820, he was awarded a Doctor of Laws from Bowdoin College. John, his brother, served as Governor of New Hampshire from 1828 to 1829, and Bell was also the uncle of Charles Henry Bell, who was the governor from 1881 to 1883. Bell died in Chester, New Hampshire at the age of 80. He is buried in Chester Village Cemetery, Rockingham, New Hampshire.

According to local folklore the story is based on events that took place during the reign of King Rama IV. The legend The story is about a beautiful young woman named Mae Nak, who lived on the banks of the Phra Khanong Canal, and her undying love for her husband, Mak. With Mae Nak pregnant, Mak is conscripted and sent to war (in some versions of the story the war is against the Shan tribe, while others are not specific), where he is seriously wounded. While he is being nursed back to health in central Bangkok, Mae Nak and their child both die during a difficult childbirth. When Mak returns home, however, he finds his loving wife and child waiting for him. Neighbors who try to warn him that he is living with a ghost are all killed. One day, as Mae Nak is preparing nam phrik, she drops a lime off the porch. In her haste to retrieve it, she stretches her arm to pick it up from the ground below. Mak sees it and at last realizes his wife is a ghost. Terrified, he tries to find a way to flee without alarming her. That night, Mak says he has to go downstairs to urinate. He then runs away into the night. Discovering her husband has fled, Mae Nak pursues him. Mak sees her and conceals himself behind a Blumea balsamifera (; pronounced Nat) bush.‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏î (Blumea balsamifera (L.) DC.) According to folklore, ghosts are afraid of the sticky Blumea leaves. Mak then runs to Wat Mahabut temple, which a ghost cannot enter, as it is holy ground. In her grief, Mae Nak terrorizes the people of Phra Khanong, furious at them for causing Mak to leave her. However, Mae Nak's ghost is captured by a powerful exorcist. Confining her in an earthen jar, he throws it into the canal. There are differing versions of the rest of the story. In one, an old couple new to Phra Khanong finds the jar while fishing; in another two fishermen dredge up the jar. Nak is freed when they opened it. Mae Nak is conquered again by the venerable monk Somdet Phra Phutthachan (To Phrommarangsi). The learned monk confines her spirit in the bone of her forehead and binds it in his waistband. Legend says the waistband is currently in the possession of the royal family. Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon, also claimed to have had the relic.‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏à‡∏ö ‡∏¢‡∏¥‡πà‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏•.

A shrine dedicated to Mae Nak is at Wat Mahabut. In 1997, the shrine was relocated to the nearby Suan Luang District of modern Bangkok. An alternative account Anek Nawikamul, a Thai historian, researched the story and found an article in the Siam Praphet newspaper written by K.S.R. Kularb, dated March 10, 1899. Kularb claimed the story of Mae Nak was based on the life of Amdaeng Nak (‡∏≠‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏î‡∏á‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Å, 'Mrs Nak'), daughter of a Tambon Phra Khanong leader named Khun Si. Amdaeng Nak died while she was pregnant. Her son, worried that his father might remarry and his inheritance shared with his step-mother, invented the ghost story. He dressed in women's clothing and threw rocks at passing boats to make people think Nak's ghost had done it. Kularb also suggested that Nak's husband was named Chum, not Mak. The Mae Nak Shrine The shrine of Mae Nak stands next to Klong Phra Khanong, at Wat Mahabut, a large temple on Soi 77 off Sukhumvit Road (On Nut Road). The shrine is a low building under large trees with a roof that encompasses the tree trunks. The main shrine has several minor shrines around it. =Offerings= A statue of Mae Nak and her infant form the centerpiece of the shrine. Devotees often make offerings, accompanied by a request for help, generally by women seeking easy childbirth or for their husband to be exempted from military conscription. Offerings are usually lengths of colored cloth, wrapped around the trunk of the Bo tree. Other offerings include fruit, lotuses, and incense sticks. Toys for her child and portraits of the ghost are displayed in the shrine's inner sanctum. A collection of fine dresses offered to her are displayed behind her statue. Offerings are also made at Phra Khanong Canal, where fish purchased live at markets are brought in buckets to the edge of the canal and freed. Stalls at the shrine sell toys, fish, lotus buds, incense sticks, and garlands for those who wish to make an offering. In popular culture Mae Nak's story has enjoyed sustained popularity because her undying devotion to her husband inspires people of all ages. Prince Damrong, a son of King Mongkut, revealed that when he was a child, he kept asking Wat Phra Kaeo visitors who was the most popular person in their opinion, and most people answered \\"Mae Nak\\".

It was the first designated country park in Britain, opening in 1973. The park is located along the Wirral Way, which follows the track bed of part of the former Birkenhead Railway route from West Kirby to Hooton. The old line, which closed in 1962, follows the estuary of the River Dee for between West Kirby and Parkgate. The route then heads inland, across the Wirral peninsula, to Hooton. There are two visitor centres along the Wirral Way. The visitor centres are located near to the site of Thurstaston railway station, at Thurstaston, and at the preserved Hadlow Road railway station, in Willaston. History The preserved Hadlow Road railway station, on the Wirral Way at Willaston. Work began on the park in 1969, and the park was formally opened in 1973 by Lord Leverhulme. The park's creation followed a successful campaign by Captain Lawrence Beswick DSM, which prompted the necessary investment from the Countryside Commission. Construction of the park required the removal of of railway track and accompanying sleepers, the digging and forming of drainage channels, levelling and consolidation of thousands of tons of gravel or ballast, and the removal of some brick built road bridges. The old station platform at Thurstaston, the preserved 1950s-era railway station at Hadlow Road, Willaston, a number of bridges and the occasional railway incline signs, which indicate a degree of climb or descent, are some of the few remains of the original railway line. Wildlife The park is home to badgers and foxes and to ten species of butterfly identified among the local wildlife. The estuary along which the park is located is home to populations of ragworm, lugworm, and cockles which support various species of bird wildlife in the area, including common redshanks, common shelducks, northern lapwings, skylarks, meadow pipits and terns. During high spring tides visitors may also catch a glimpse of certain birds of prey such as peregrines, hen harriers and the daytime hunting short-eared owls. Sports Wirral Country Park is very popular with ramblers and offers numerous walks, three being of particular note. Firstly is the stretch of shoreline running a couple of miles from Thurstaston Beach to Heswall Beach, a popular route for horse riders as well. Secondly is The Wirral Way, a walk in length that starts in West Kirby at the top end and runs down to Hooton at the other end. The country park itself lies along the Wirral Way towards the middle of this route. Thirdly is the circular Heswall Dales and fields walk, via a small valley known as 'The Dungeon'. A well known route within Merseyside, with part of it running through Wirral Country Park and encompassing some of the aforementioned walks, is the Wirral Coastal Walk. It is organised as an annual event by the Rotary Club, with over 5,000 taking part in 2008. The Walk follows the Wirral coastline from Seacombe Ferry on the River Mersey to Thurstaston Country Park on the River Dee, a distance of . The annual event has become a popular way for local charities and organisations to raise money for their cause. Wirral Country Park is popular not only for its wildlife and country walking, but also cycling, horse riding, kite flying, quad biking and paragliding. The Wirral Way is very popular with cyclists, especially at weekends. Part of the Wirral Endurance Ride, a horse-riding event in the Endurance GB National Championship, is held along the Wirral Way.

In 1993 he became the first African American umpire to work behind home plate in a World Series game. He wore uniform number 25. Williams was born in Denver, Colorado, attended George Washington High School, and became an All-America football player at Long Beach City College, later attending California State University, Los Angeles. In his rookie season, Williams umpired third base for Tom Seaver's only no- hitter on June 16, 1978. Williams was the only umpire to eject Steve Garvey from a game, which occurred during the 1986 season and received media coverage for the incident. Williams was the first base umpire in a 1990 game between the Mets and Braves, when he was involved in a well-known incident. With two Braves' on base, Met pitcher David Cone induced a chopper from Mark Lemke, fielded by Gregg Jefferies, who threw to Cone at first base. Williams mistakenly ruled Lemke safe. Cone argued vociferously with Williams while still holding the ball (Cone thought time had been called), and both Braves' runners scored while Cone was distracted.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/191828e7 Williams was the home plate umpire for one of the longest games in World Series history, Game 4 of the 1993 World Series between the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays, which lasted 4 hours and 14 minutes and ended with a 15‚Äì14 Toronto victory and a 3‚Äì1 Series lead for the Blue Jays. He was the first base umpire on June 3, 1995 when Pedro Mart√≠nez pitched 9 perfect innings before giving up a hit in the 10th. In 1999, he was shoved by Mets third base coach Cookie Rojas after Rojas disputed Williams' \\"foul ball\\" call on a ball hit down the line by outfielder Darryl Hamilton. Rojas was suspended for five games. He also worked the All-Star games in 1985 and 1995, the 1989 National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Chicago Cubs, the 1997 NLCS between the Florida Marlins and the Atlanta Braves, and the 1999 National League Division Series. He ejected San Diego Padres first baseman Steve Garvey from a June, 1986 game between the Padres and the Atlanta Braves, the only ejection of Garvey's career, then ejected Padres manager Steve Boros the next day when Boros tried to present a videotape of the call Williams ejected Garvey over. He was also an umpire on September 28, 1988 when Orel Hershiser set the Major League record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched. He remained an umpire until his retirement in 2000 due to health problems, and died at age 61 in Chicago, Illinois after a long illness related to diabetes and kidney failure. Personal life Williams was the uncle of former Major League catcher Lenny Webster.

It was authorised on 13 September 1988 to recognise prescribed service in \\"warlike\\" operations, backdated to February 1975. It is awarded with a clasp to denote the prescribed operation and subsequent awards of the medal are made in the form of additional clasps.Maton 1995, p. 56. In 2012, it was announced that the medal would no longer be issued for future operations, with the AASM and the Australian Service Medal being replaced by the Australian Operational Service Medal. Description The AASM is a circular nickel-silver medal ensigned with the Crown of St Edward. The obverse has a Federation Star within a wreath of mimosa and bears a laurel wreath surrounding the inscription 'FOR ACTIVE SERVICE'. The medal ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and has a central red stripe to symbolise the danger of warlike operations. It is flanked by stripes of silver-green which in turn are flanked by stripes of light green, gold, dark green and brown. The ribbon bar consists of a strip of full-sized ribbon with no emblem. Clasps The following clasps were authorised for issue with the AASM: =Balkans= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) with the United Nations Peacekeeping activities in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR, UNMIBH, UNCRO, UNPREDEP, UNTAES) from 12 January 1992 to 24 January 1997. =Cambodia= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) from 20 October 1991 to 7 October 1993. =East Timor= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) with the: :* United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), Operation Faber, from 16 September 1999 to 23 February 2000. :* ADF contribution to the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), Operation Warden, from 16 September 1999 to 10 April 2000. ::See also INTERFET Medal. :* UN mandated International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), Operation Stabilise, from 16 September 1999 to 23 February 2000. :* United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), Operation Tanager, from 20 February 2000 to 19 May 2002. :* United Nations Mission of Support to East Timor (UNMISET), Operation Citadel, from 20 May 2002 to 17 August 2003. =ICAT= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) as part of the International Coalition Against Terror: :* with the ADF contribution deployed overseas to the United States-led military response to international terrorism, Operation Slipper, from 11 October 2001 to 5 December 2002, and from 1 January 2009 to the present. :* in Diego Garcia (for 30 days/30 sorties) from 11 October 2001 to 1 August 2002. :* as part of the ADF Support to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Operation Palate, from 18 April 2003 to 4 July 2004. :* as part of the ADF Support to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Operation Palate II, from 27 June 2005 to the present. ::See also Afghanistan Medal. =Iraq= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) in the area comprising Iraq for service as a member of the ADF assigned for service to: :* Operation Jural with the United Kingdom elements of the coalition force from 30 June 1991 to 12 January 2003. :* Operation Provide Comfort with the United States elements of the coalition force from 11 August 1991 to 15 December 1996. :* Operation Bolton with the United Kingdom elements of the coalition force from 31 August 1992 to 12 January 2003. :* Operation Southern Watch with the United States elements of the coalition force from 31 August 1992 to 12 January 2003. :* Operation Northern Watch with the United States elements of the coalition force from 1 January 1997 to 12 January 2003. =Iraq 2003= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) in the Middle East Area as part of the: :* ADF contribution deployed overseas to the United States-led military coalition operations to remove the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Operation Falconer, from 18 March 2003 to 22 July 2003. :* ADF participation in United States-led coalition in Iraq, to support the effort to assist with the rehabilitation of Iraq, and to remove the threat posed to world security by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability, Operation Catalyst, from 16 July 2003 to 31 July 2009. :* ADF participation to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, Operation Riverbank, from 21 July 2008. :* ADF participation to the provision of security in Iraq, Operation Kruger, from 1 January 2009. ::See also Iraq Medal. =Kuwait= : Service with the multinational deployment in the Persian Gulf from 17 January 1991 to 28 February 1991. : Service on HMAS Canberra during Operation Damask VI from 13‚Äì19 January 1993. =Middle East= : Service of 1 or more days with the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organisation (UNTSO) in southern Lebanon from 12 July 2006 to 14 August 2006. =Namibia= : 30 days of service with the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) from 18 February 1989 to 10 April 1990. =Rwanda= :1 day of service with the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, Operation Tamar, from 25 July 1994 to 8 March 1996. =Sierra Leone= : Service of 1 or more days with the International Military Advisory and Training Team or attached to British forces involved in Operation Husky from 15 January 2001 to 28 February 2003. =Somalia= :1 day of service (or 1 sortie) with the: :* Battalion Group for Operation Solace as a part of UNOSOM I from 10 January 1993 to 21 May 1993. :* Naval Component for Operation Solace from 10 January 1993 to 21 May 1993. :* Land components of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II from 1 May 1993 to 28 March 1995. :* Air components of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II from 1 May 1993 to 28 March 1995. =Vietnam 1975= : 1 day of service associated with RAAF activities with Transport Support Flight Butterworth or HQ Richmond Detachment 'S' to UNICEF, from 29 March 1975 to 28 April 1975. Returned from Active Service Badge Recipients of the Australian Active Service Medal are also entitled to the issue of the Returned from Active Service Badge (RASB). The RASB is the only campaign service badge awarded post-World War II. It is worn on the left lapel and only in civilian attire, to reflect that the recipient has been involved in warlike service. The brass badge has a serial number with a prefix denoting the member's service, and has been awarded since 1945 where the only change to its appearance has been the replacement of the King George VI's crown with that of the Queen Elizabeth's. Unlike most awards, the RASB is not issued to deceased members or the next-of-kin, as the badge represents a return from the member's warlike service. The replacement of the AASM with the Operational Service Medal was announced in May 2012; as a result, the RASB has been retired with the AASM, with the Operational Service Badge filling the role of being a badge indicative of a members' warlike service. Related medals A separate campaign medal in the Australian system is awarded for major operations and wars, and several ‚Äì such as the Afghanistan Medal and the Iraq Medal ‚Äì were issued concurrently with the AASM. These are referenced under their respective clasps, such as the \\"ICAT\\" clasp. Personnel who received this medal may also be entitled to receive a service or campaign medal from an international organisation or the host country ‚Äì such as the NATO Medal ‚Äì if they meet the eligibility criteria for those medals. These are treated as foreign medals in the Australian system, and if approved for wear on service uniforms, are worn after Australian medals in the order they are received. Recipients of the ASM may be authorised to wear two or three further medals for the same period of service; an Australian campaign medal, a medal from an international organisation and a medal from a host nation. Some of the international and host nation medals have been granted a blanket authority for all recipients to wear. Others are approved on an individual basis.

It's notable as it is the first comprehensive volume on the computer simulation of certain patterns in nature found in plant development (L-systems). The book is no longer in print but is available free online.Algorithmic Botany at the University of Calgary: The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants Contents The book has eight chapters: * Chapter 1 - Graphical modeling using L-systems * Chapter 2 - Modeling of trees * Chapter 3 - Developmental models of herbaceous plants * Chapter 4 - Phyllotaxis * Chapter 5 - Models of plant organs * Chapter 6 - Animation of plant development * Chapter 7 - Modeling of cellular layers * Chapter 8 - Fractal properties of plants Reception George Klir, reviewing the book in the International Journal of General Systems, writes that \\"This book, full of beautiful pictures of plants of great variety, is a testimony of the genius of Aristid Lindenmayer, who invented in 1968 systems that are now named by him -- Lindenmayer systems or L-systems. It is also a testimony of the power of current computer technology. The pictures in the book are not photographs of real plants. They are all generated on the computer by relatively simple algorithms based upon the idea of L-systems.\\" Klir goes on to explain the mathematics of L-systems, involving replacement of strings of symbols with further strings according to production rules, adding that \\"high computer power is essential since the generation of realistic forms requires tremendous numbers of replacements and the geometric interpretation of the generated strings requires a highly sophisticated computer graphics\\". Adrian Bell, reviewing the book in New Phytologist, writes that it demands respect for three reasons, namely that it is the first book to explain the algorithms behind virtual plants, it \\"unashamedly\\" connects art and science, and is unusual in being a real book on a computer-based subject. Each chapter, writes Bell, is an introductory manual to the simulation of an aspect of plant form, resulting \\"eventually\\" in a 3-D image of a plant architecture. Peter Antonelli, reviewing the book in SIAM Review, writes that it presents a \\"beautifully designed 'coffee-table-book'\\" summary of Lindenmayer's school of thought, explaining how Algorithmic Language Theory, like Noam Chomsky's theory of grammar, can describe how repeated structural units can arrange themselves. Antonelli suggests that Goethe would have disapproved of having the barrier of mathematics between the observer and the observed. Karl Niklas, reviewing the book in The Quarterly Review of Biology, writes that the book, intended for many different audiences, is \\"unequally successful\\" in reaching them. Niklas suggests that those who wonder about how graphic artists create \\"the magnificent cyber-floras that sway and grow so realistically in the movies\\", and those who admire plant symmetry will enjoy the book. He is more skeptical about its claim to serious science as the book \\"fails to educate its readers\\" about the challenge of understanding plant form in terms of developmental biology. Therefore he believes the book falls short, the dazzling beauty of fractals not proving their relevance to biology.

Football Only 171 cm tall, Skilton was particularly fast and a superb baulker,A manoeuvre where a player holds the ball out to the side in one hand (e.g., ), then brings the ball back to the chest, and runs in the other direction. The move is performed to evade a defender, who will attack in the ball's original direction, rather than the ball-and-player's subsequent direction. It is an entirely different ploy from a \\"dummy\\" pass. Other noted exponents of the \\"baullk\\" manoeuvre were Les Foote and Kevin Sheedy. allowing him to evade opponents when necessary. He was never shy of attacking the ball, however, and in his 16-year career suffered many injuries, including concussion, a broken nose four times, a broken wrist three times and 12 black eyes. One of his greatest assets was the ability to kick with both feet, a skill learned at the insistence of his father, and developed by spending hours kicking the ball against a wall, collecting it on the rebound and kicking again with the other foot. It was impossible to say whether he was right or left footed, since his left foot gave greater accuracy, but his right greater distance. He had arguably the most accurate stab kick in the game.The stab kick has now all but disappeared from AFL football.

Skilton made his senior debut at the age of 17 in round five, 1956 and went on to play 237 matches for South Melbourne before he retired in 1971, at the time a club record. He scored 412 goals in that time and was the club's leading goalkicker on three occasions. Nicknamed 'Chimp', he showed great grit and determination and became well known for giving maximum effort at all times. It was his appearance on the front page of The Sun News-Pictorial in 1968 with two black eyes that earned him the Douglas Wilkie Medal. The black eyes were a consequence of a severe facial injury, which included depressed fractures of his cheekbones, due to collisions in successive weeks from Footscray's Ken Greenwood, his own teammate John Rantall and then Len Thompson. An extended series of graphic photographs displaying the true extent of Skilton's injury used to be on display at the team's rooms at the Lake Oval, prior to its move to Sydney (it is not on display in Sydney and it is commonly understood that it was first removed from display at the Lake Oval as part of the effort to get Tuddenham to coach South Melbourne in 1978). He missed the entire 1969 VFL season after snapping an Achilles tendon in a pre-season practice match against SANFL club Port Adelaide. Chosen to represent his state in 25 games, Skilton captained the Victorian team in 1963 and 1965. The downside of his career was the lack of success of his club. He often said that he would trade any of his three Brownlow Medals for a premiership or even the chance to play in a Grand Final, and felt the highest point of his career was the one occasion South Melbourne made the finals in 1970 (under the great Norm Smith), finishing fourth after losing the first semi-final against St Kilda. After 16 years at South Melbourne, including two years as playing coach in 1965‚Äì1966 and nine club best and fairest awards, Skilton then played for his boyhood team, Port Melbourne in the Victorian Football Association and later coached Melbourne from 1974‚Äì1977, with a best finish of sixth. Since then, Skilton has been honoured by being named captain of the Swans' team of the century, and named in the AFL team of the century. He was also the player featured inside the cover of the booklets of stamps featuring the Swans released by Australia Post to commemorate the centenary of the VFL/AFL. Skilton made a speech in the post-match presentations of the 2005 AFL Grand Final following his team's first win in 72 years, and was tasked to present the trophy at the 2012 AFL Grand Final.
