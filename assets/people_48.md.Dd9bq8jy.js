As a two-year-old in 2015 he showed some promise by finishing second on his first two starts and then winning a minor race before his season was ended by a leg infection. In 2016 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Japan, winning the Tokinominoru Kinen, Satsuki Sho and St Lite Kinen as well as finishing third in the Tokyo Yushun and fourth in the Kikuka Sho. He was retired from racing after two disappointing efforts in the spring of 2017. Background Dee Majesty is a bay horse with a white blaze and white socks on his forelegs bred in Japan by his owner, Masaru Shimada's Hattori Farm. He was trained throughout his racing career by Yoshitaka Ninomiya. He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. His dam Hermes Tiara never raced but her mother was a half-sister to both Generous and Imagine. Dee Majesty was described by his groom as embodying the best qualities of his male ancestors, having \\"the body of Brian's Time, the heart and lungs of Sadler's Wells and the sharpness of Deep Impact\\". Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Dee Majesty began his track career by finishing second to King Lion in an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1500 metres at Sapporo Racecourse on 5 September. Three weeks later at Nakayama Racecourse he contested a maiden race over 1800 metres came home second of the thirteen runners behind Meiner Fun. The colt recorded his first success at Tokyo Racecourse on 23 November when he won a maiden from Mount Robson and thirteen others. He was then aimed at the Grade 2 Hopeful Stakes but was withdrawn from the race owing to a leg inflammation. =2016: three- year-old season= Dee Majesty's trainer Yoshitaka Ninomiya On his debut as a three-year-old Dee Majesty started a 21.6/1 outsider for the Grade 3 Tokinominoru Kinen over 1800 metres at Tokyo. Ridden by Masayoshi Ebina he won by one and a quarter lengths from Immortal with the odds-on favourite Hartley (winner of the Hopeful Stakes) coming home ninth of the ten finishers. Yoshitaka Ninomiya commented \\"The rider was urging him on from just before the final turn but I think the going was at its worst right there. He gave it his all and peeled off from the rest of the field with the fastest final 3-furlong time of the field for what was a very strong race.\\" For his next run Dee Majesty ran in the Grade 1 Satsuki Sho, the first leg of the Japanese Triple Crown over 2000 metres at Nakayama on 17 April. In the run-up to the race said \\"He's still growing and is still a bit weak in his back and hindquarters, but he has gained a bit of weight and has the physique of a mature horse. He has an excellent heart and strong lungs and his breathing is very good.\\" With Ebina in the saddle, Dee Majesty started a 30/1 outsider in a field of eighteen three-year-old colts. Satono Diamond started favourite ahead of Leontes and Makahiki while the other runners included Air Spinel (Daily Hai Nisai Stakes), Mount Robson (Spring Stakes), Lord Quest (second in the Hopeful Stakes), Admire Daio (Wakaba Stakes) and Dreadnoughtus (Kyoto Nisai Stakes). Dee Majsty raced towards the rear before making a forward move on the outside approaching the final turn. He produced a strong run in the straight, took the lead from Leontes 100 metres from the finish and drew away to win by one and a quarter lengths, with Makahiki taking second ahead of Satono Diamond. The winning time of 1:57.9 was a new record for the race. Masayoshi Ebina said \\"everything went as planned. He was responding really well turning the last corner and I knew then that he'll be able to take over the field at the top of the slope\\". Dee Majesty's regular jockey Masayoshi Ebina On 29 May, in front of a crowd of 140,000 at Tokyo, Dee Majesty started 2.5/1 favourite for the Tokyo Yushun with the best-fancied of his seventeen opponents being Satono Diamond, Makahiki and Leontes. Ebina repeated his tactics from the Satsuki Sho, coming from well off the pace before moving up on the outside for a late run in the straight, but on this occasion he was never able to get to the lead and finished third, beaten a nose and half a length by Makahiki and Satono Diamond. After the summer break, Dee Majesty returned to the track in the Grade 2 St Lite Kinen over 2200 metres at Nakayama on 18 September and started odds-on favourite against eleven opponents headed by the Grade 3 winner Seewind. Ridden by Ebina, he won by a neck from Seewind, with Prodigal Son a length and a quarter back in third. On 23 October Dee Majesty started second choice in the betting for the Kikuka Sho over 2800 metres at Kyoto Racecourse but despite finishing strongly he came home fourth behind Satono Diamond, Rainbow Line and Air Spinel, beaten two and three quarter lengths by the winner. On his final race of the year the colt was matched against older horses in the Japan Cup on 27 November but made no impact and finished towards the rear of the field in a race won by Kitasan Black. In the 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Dee Majesty was given a rating of 120, making him the 34th best racehorse in the world. =2017: four-year-old season= Dee Majesty began his third season in the Nikkei Sho at Nakayama on 25 March and finished sixth of the sixteen runners behind Sciacchetra. A month later he started a 35/1 outsider for the spring edition of the Tenno Sho at Kyoto and came home sixth in a race won by Kitasan Black. Dee Majesty never raced again and was retired at the end of the season. Stud record After the end of his racing career, Dee Majesty became a breeding stallion at the Arrow Stud in Hokkaido.

Planning the railway The project involved a climb of 500 metres, crossing the mountains of the Venezuelan Coastal Range; the route chosen involved a short coast run from Puerto Cabello to El Palito at the mouth of the River Aguas Calientes, after which the line mostly followed the course of the river.Carruthers, J. 1889.

Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers 96 (1889):120-130. doi: 10.1680/imotp.1889.20790. =Gauge= The gauge was . The use of a narrow gauge to help with the problems caused by hilly terrain was consistent with the principles of the engineer Robert Fairlie, who was involved in the initial surveying of the route. However, it was not possible to avoid steep gradients, and a rack and pinion section was constructed at Las Trincheras. The same gauge was used by the slightly later Great Venezuela Railway, which also ran to Valencia. The two lines were originally separate, but were eventually connected. Construction and history of the railway Guzm√°n Blanco, the president of Venezuela, gave a concession to a British company to build the railway. The railway was inaugurated in February 1888 by Guzman Blanco's successor Herm√≥genes L√≥pez. The railway was nationalised in 1916. Stations As the site chosen for Valencia's terminus was at Camoruco, a suburb 3 km from the city center, plans were made in advance for a tramway (initially horse- drawn) from the station to the Plaza Bol√≠var. There were six other stations, * Naguanagua * La Entrada * Las Trincheras, a locality known for its hot springs, * El Cambur * El Palito * Puerto Cabello. New railway In the 21st century work began on a new railway from Puerto Cabello to , a transport hub in Aragua State. The project has been planned by the State Railways Institution. The route partly replicates the former railway, but the scale is more ambitious. Among the tunnels is the 7,702 m B√°rbula Tunnel, between Las Trincheras and Naguanagua, which is claimed to be the longest in South America. In 2016 work on the Puerto Cabello railway was described as \\"irregular and marked by slow payments by the client as a result of the country‚Äôs poor economic conditions, mainly related to the drop in the price of oil.\\"  See also  * Rail transport in Venezuela References 3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Venezuela Railway lines opened in 1888 ","title":"Puerto Cabello and Valencia railway"},{"id":"60525792","text":"Ophiuchus Supercluster is a nearby galaxy supercluster in the constellation Ophiuchus.

The main building survives and it is a Grade II listed building. History The hospital, which was designed by George Gilbert Scott and William Bonython Moffatt using a corridor layout, opened as the Shropshire and Wenlock Borough Lunatic Asylum in March 1845. A major extension, involving five extra wards, was completed in 1884. It became Salop Mental Hospital in 1921 and saw service as the Copthorne and Shelton Emergency Hospital during the Second World War. Shortly after reaching its peak population of 1,027 patients in 1947, the facility joined the National Health Service as Shelton Hospital in 1948. On 26 February 1968, tragedy struck the hospital when a fire ripped through a female ward, killing 21 patients. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in September 2012. The main buildings were subsequently converted into apartments as Leighton Park. Meanwhile, a modern mental health facility known as the Redwoods Centre has been established a little south of the old hospital.

She lives and works in Paris and Berlin.  Early life  Katinka Bock was born in Frankfurt am Main and studied sculpture and visual arts at the Wei√üensee Academy of Art Berlin, receiving her diploma in 2002. She was a master student under Inge Mahn until 2004, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin-Weissensee. She received a post-graduate degree from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux- arts de Lyon in 2005. She is represented by the Galerie Jocelyn Wolff in Paris, Meyer Riegger of Berlin and Karlsruhe and Greta Meert in Brussels.  Artistic Work  Katinka Bock‚Äôs oeuvre is predominantly focused on the transformative processes that take place when confronting natural and man-made elements, exploring the process through which each aspect transforms the other. Katinka Bock explores the relationship between urban landscapes and natural elements, placing her works in open spaces to face the elements, often imprinting her experiences through her materials. Some of her works are balanced in precarious such as the dynamic yet unsteadily placed mobiles resting on lemons in Farben dieses Meeres Balance (zweifach), Bock‚Äôs pieces generate and inhabit their own spaces and environments, actively interacting with and on occasion changing them. Much of her work is based on fluid movements ‚Äì instead of breaking, chiseling or hacking, her materials are shaped, folded, cut, or simply placed in a context-specific constellation or construction. Bock prefers to integrate natural materials such as leather, wood, stone, fabric, plaster, ceramics or graphite, as well as individual found or otherwise unusual objects. Katinka Bock‚Äôs repeated use of water in her works is not as much significant for the physical effects it produces, as it is for the symbolism it is charged with. Redirecting already occurring sources of water within both urban and rural landscapes, she builds structures that create a symbiotic relationship between the piece and the context in which it is placed. Incorporating rain water, water from public fountains, water from rivers or from the sea, the sculptures are animated, altered or adapted to the flow of the spaces which they interact with. One such example is the piece Hysteros, in which a wooden module placed in a Toulousian exhibition space is connected by a cable to the branch of a tree standing on a riverbed outside. The structure confined to the gallery moves up and down, reacting to the movement of the water current. At times influenced by their surroundings, Katinka‚Äôs works often exist in a highly site-specific context. Based on fluid and shifting elements tied to a certain context, their final form is often difficult to predict and entirely organic. Some works, such as Winter or Seecham√§leon are transported from their previous locations, existing between two different temporal experiences, marked by their past in an uncannily human manner. They inhabit the spaces in which they are placed by the artist, being influenced by their surroundings while also changing them themselves independently of human influence. Similarly, Katinka Bock‚Äôs work often integrates living natural elements into the physical structures of her installations or sculptures. Creating a symbiotic relationship between the changing and growing fauna and the static man-made construction casted from bronze, trees or plants become an integral part of her sculptural repertoire and ensure that the works are constantly moving, changing and quite literally growing. The sculpture titled La Grande Fontaine, which can be seen on the tracks of the tramway line 3b near Porte d‚ÄôAubervilliers in Paris since 2013, is one of such pieces, in which a cherry tree occupies the center of a lengthy sculpture out of bronze, granite and ceramics.

It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Diop made history when the film premiered at Cannes, becoming the first black woman to direct a film featured in competition at the festival. The film is centered around a young woman, Ada, and her partner, Souleiman, struggling in the face of employment, class, migration, crime, family struggles, and ghosts. Working mostly with unknown actors, Diop focused in the film on issues such as the refugee crisis, remorse, loss, grief, class struggle, and taking responsibility (or not) of one's actions. The Atlantic Ocean is used in many ways throughout the film, including as a symbol and engine for change, growth, life, and death. Plot In a suburb of Dakar that lies along the Atlantic coast, a futuristic-looking tower is about to be officially opened. The construction workers have not been paid for months. One night, the workers decide to leave the country by sea, in search of a brighter future in Spain. Among them is Souleiman, the lover of Ada. However, Ada is betrothed to another man ‚Äì the wealthy Omar. Ada is deeply worried about Souleiman, as she waits for news of his fate in the run-up to her wedding. On her wedding day, Omar's bed mysteriously catches fire in a suspected arson attack, and a young detective is assigned to investigate the case. In the coming days, Ada falls under suspicion and is subjected to interrogations and a virginity test. Meanwhile, her friend Fanta, as well as the young detective are suffering from a mysterious illness. It slowly emerges that the spirits of the men lost at sea have returned and each night take possession of the bodies of other inhabitants of Dakar. Most have their focus on the tycoon who withheld their pay, forcing them to go across the sea. They demand their pay, threatening to burn the tower down otherwise. When they receive their pay from the tycoon they force him to dig their graves so that their spirits may rest. But Souleiman wants only to be with Ada. Unfortunately, he has possessed the young detective, which initially scares Ada. But as she meets the other spirits, including one who possesses Fanta, she comes to understand and spends a last night with the new Souleiman. While reviewing footage from the wedding, the detective sees that he, under the possession of Souleiman's spirit, was the one who committed the arson. He closes the case. Cast Reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 7.87/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"An unpredictable supernatural drama rooted in real-world social commentary, Atlantique suggests a thrillingly bright future for debuting filmmaker Mati Diop.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". At Cannes, the film won the Grand Prix. It was selected as the Senegalese entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, making the December shortlist. Atlantique won Best First Feature in IndieWire's 2019 Critics Poll, and was ranked fourth in Best Foreign Film. Former United States President Barack Obama named Atlantics among his favorite films and television series of 2019. In his annual list of favorite films, which he released on Twitter on 29 December 2019. =Critical reviews= K. Austin Collins writing for Vanity Fair stated, \\"Atlantics stuns and surprises because it tries to pull off something slippery and hard to define, a ghost story (or is it a zombie story?) that‚Äôs rooted in the material reality of Dakar and its lower classes, that‚Äôs openly political, accordingly, but which also seems flickering and unreal, alive to whatever these mysteries have in store... Atlantics should have us scrambling to see whatever [Diop] makes next.\\" Hannah Giorgis of The Atlantic commented, \\"In Atlantics, the Cannes Grand Prix‚Äìwinning film by the French-Senegalese director Mati Diop, the water is both a threat and a source of comfort. With soft camerawork and pointed dialogue, Diop casts a shadow over the sea and all its possibilities... The result is a transportive love story with an undercurrent of social critique that manages to be at once haunting and hopeful.\\" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, \\"Atlantique is about the return of the repressed, or the suppressed: the men who were denied their rightful pay on the building site then faced the real possibility of a watery grave. Their spirit rises up, and this becomes a ghost story or a revenge story. Atlantique may not be perfect, but I admired the way that Diop did not simply submit to the realist mode expected from this kind of material, and yet neither did she go into a clich√©d magic-realist mode, nor make the romantic story the film‚Äôs obvious centre. Her film has a seductive mystery.\\" Justin Chang in his review for the Los Angeles Times noted, \\" Drawing on a potent vein of local mythology, Diop weaves these paranormal elements into her canvas with thrift, ingenuity and bracing matter-of- factness. In her hands, a vengeful ghost seems no more absurd or irrational than, say, the futuristic high-rise tower that‚Äôs being erected on the coast.\\" Bilal Qureshi of NPR said, \\"It's the story of the women...left behind. And it's a ghost story. Atlantics is a ghost story about migration. It dramatizes the stories of the young men who leave countries like Senegal in hopes of reaching Europe, and how their absence ‚Äî and their loss ‚Äî haunts the women they leave behind.\\" Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com gave the film four stars out of four, commenting, \\"On the surface, this is a familiar story of lovers kept apart by circumstances beyond their control, but ‚ÄúAtlantics‚Äù quickly reveals itself to be so much deeper that. Diop, who co-wrote the screenplay with Olivier Demangel, blends the story with the desperation that forces them to leave home and loved ones, echoes of the refugee crisis, a look at the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy and the fetishization of virginity, purity, and marriage. The mystery of ‚ÄúAtlantics‚Äù unravels slowly, its gentle twists keep surprises hidden in plain sight.\\" Jay Weissberg writing for Variety stated, \\"The capricious ocean is a recurrent, mesmerizing image in Mati Diop‚Äôs feature debut ‚ÄúAtlantics,‚Äù but given its perfidious connotations for the people of Senegal, who‚Äôve lost so many souls to its depths, the director ensures the rolling waves remain hypnotic rather than beautiful. It‚Äôs the right decision for this romantic and melancholy film, more apt than some of the flawed narrative choices that frustrate though don‚Äôt compromise the atmosphere of loss and female solidarity in the story of a young woman whose love has died at sea. Part social commentary, part ghost tale, ‚ÄúAtlantics‚Äù will get a major boost from its Cannes competition slot and could see strong international sales.\\" IndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the movie B+ grade and noted, \\"As it ventures further along its spellbinding path, ‚ÄúAtlantics‚Äù remains a deeply romantic work that magnetized the fears of people trapped by their surroundings and striving for the companionship that can rescue them from despair. It doesn‚Äôt quite let them get there, but Diop doesn‚Äôt strike a hopeless tone the whole way through. Ultimately, ‚ÄúAtlantics‚Äù shows how that even these bleak circumstances can have empowering ramifications for the women trapped by the shore, and why it‚Äôs a portal to a better life even if they stay put.\\" Leslie Felperin in her review for The Hollywood Reporter noted, \\"...the film pulls together some exceedingly strong components. It has buckets of atmosphere to spare, enough to build a biome or two on Mars. Nevertheless, the script sometimes feels like a concept for a short attenuated to make a feature running time, and in-the-rough performances from some of the supporting, non- professional players ‚Äî although discovery teenage Mama Sane in the lead role is a delight ‚Äî somewhat dilute its strong brew. On the other hand, some viewers may actively savor the rawer, ragged edges.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film four and half stars out of five, commenting \\"...even when things start to dip into supernatural territory, Atlantics remains oddly grounded, still dedicated to tackling a topical subject without being dogmatic. You feel as if you‚Äôre watching something that‚Äôs region-specific, yet it never makes its characters feel like ‚Äúothers.‚Äù Nor do you ever sense that the act of giving these often agency-less females a voice is something based in charity, because Diop makes the endeavor feel like a necessity. It ends with a moment of desire and transcendental bliss, as well as a settling of scores and a glance into a mirror that, in a single edit, becomes a stare fixed straight at the audience. The look is not accusatory, however, so much as a suggestion of complicity, a sharing of a secret. It doubles as a nifty summation of the entire film. Atlantics pulls you into an experience. The empathy machine runs at full speed here.\\" Kelsey Adams of Now gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, \\"Although it‚Äôs a migrant story, it focuses on those left behind. As the distressed women grapple with the departure of their men, things turn increasingly uncanny. Unexplained arson and illnesses shift Atlantics into supernatural territory, and Diop incorporates elements of Muslim mysticism and French folklore without being gimmicky. The deft blend of fantasy and drama uses supernatural elements to home in on the abundant, unjust realities the characters face.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker noted, \\"Diop films the characters and the city with a tactile intimacy and a teeming energy that are heightened by the soundtrack‚Äôs polyphony of voices and music; she dramatizes the personal experience of public matters‚Äîreligious tradition, women‚Äôs autonomy, migration, corruption‚Äîwith documentary-based fervor, rhapsodic yearning, and bold affirmation.\\" Namwali Serpell of The Nation stated, \\"Atlantics speaks the tongue of beauty. Moonrise, sunset. Reflective glass, shards of mirror. Fluttering curtains, gauzy ones. Rosy light, constellated lights. Filigree waves, the vast implacable sea... But none of these patterns add up to a message. Rather, they weave a material form within which Diop twists plot and genre.\\"  Home media  In January 2020, it was announced that Atlantics, The Irishman, Marriage Story and American Factory would receive DVD and Blu-ray releases by The Criterion Collection.

He retired as the Director of Communicable diseases at the World Health Organization, South East Asia regional Office (WHO SEARO) in November 2018. Prior to his role in the WHO, he has served as the Head of South Asia and Regional Advisor of the Asia Pacific region of the UNAIDS and Director of Asia Pacific Country Programs of The Global Fund. Education Sarkar was an alumnus of the AIDS International Research and Training Program from the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Professional Career and contribution Sarkar joined the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 1998, and served UNAIDS at various roles for a decade, from being an Epidemiologist stationed in Geneva, to being the Team Leader of UNAIDS, South Asia and Regional Adviser to the Asia Pacific region. Sarkar's UNAIDS group pushed South Asian countries to focus prevention services for the marginalized groups in ways which were not traditional in the field. He proposed and formed self-run services by the high risk communities and is recognized to create an enabling environment by breaking the barriers that obstruct people from accessing essential services. He has advocated for political commitment, acceptance of the HIV problem by the Governments, allocation of resources, mitigation of stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and an all-inclusive approach for target group identification, prevention and care. Before returning to UNAIDS again in 2011, Sarkar worked with the Asian Development Bank and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. In 2015, Sarkar joined the World Health Organization (WHO) as the Director of Communicable diseases for its South East Asian Regional Office (SEARO). His works have shown that sex inequality and education for women and girls are strongly associated factors for HIV infection, emphasizing that the vulnerability of young women needs to be reduced by measures to improve access to schooling and education in sexuality and reproductive health. Sarkar's main activities were centered around the reduction in stigma as a part of prevention interventions within activities meant to reduce transmission among sex workers, injection drug users, MSM and their partners. These activities, referred to as ‚Äòenablers‚Äô, were required to create an enabling environment for these groups by removing barriers to access to services. These include the timing of services (for example, evening rather than daytime for sex workers), community ownership (for example, MSM, IDU or sex workers running their own clinics), removing disincentives caused by police harassment or violence and addressing other hindrances (for example, creches to look after children of sex workers while they attend clinics or those of IDUs in deaddiction services). He has openly criticized the harassment of gay population, sex workers, and drug users, which were culturally widely common across the entire region of South East Asia. He established that fear of ill treatment by the health-care staff causes many HIV-infected women in the region not to disclose their HIV status, which has led to significant delay in care-seeking behavior of the infected mother and led to significant transmission of HIV infection to the new-borns.

Issues with coccidiosis specifically due to Eimeria arloingi have also been reported in Egypt and Portugal. It is unclear whether this species is present in the Americas as most of the case reports of coccidiosis in these areas do not differentiate the species causing the disease. Infections with this species are commonly compounded by infections with other Eimeria species in \\"mixed infections.\\" This species is closely related to Eimeria bovis and Eimeria zuernii which are both highly pathogenic in cattle' Infections with this species are characterized by lesions specifically in the jejunum, but also the ilium and cecum which results in diarrhea. Oocysts begin shedding between 16 and 18 days after the animal is infected which is when the parasite is spread. The shedding can last as long as 15 days. This parasite causes an immune response in its host that includes accumulation of fluid in body cavities, presence of large numbers of leukocytes in the small intestine, and necrosis of the tissue of the small intestine. Pale yellow plaques (raised patches of epithelium) can be seen on the small intestine of severely affected kids at necropsy. Treatment Possible treatments include decoquinate, lasalocid, sulfonamides, chlortetracycline, amprolium, monensin, toltrazuril, and diclazuril. Decoquinate, toltrazuril, and diclazuril act on Eimeria at all stages of life. Specific studies to determine the best treatment for Eimeria arloingi infections have not been performed.

She is also thought to be either the daughter or granddaughter of Nagao Kageharu. Lady Shirai was a retainer of the Ashikaga Shogunate, fought and died during the Incident of Kyoto in 1565, when Ashikaga Yoshiteru was killed.  Life  Lady Shirai was a relative of Nagao Kagetora (the famed Uesugi Kensin). In 1560, Uesugi Kenshin, a warlord of Echigo province, made large expedition to Kanto region against the Later H≈çj≈ç clan. Nagayasu Narita, once belonged to Kenshin, but there arouse a quarrel between Kenshin and Nagayasu and Kenshin insulted him, thus furious Nagayasu left Kenshin and went back to Hojo clan.

Lady Shirai would divorce her husband once her turned his back on the Uesugi clan, and serve the 13th Sh≈çgun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru. At this point, she was over 50 years old, but she was still beautiful, and as she always served in close proximity to Yoshiteru she used the opportunity to talk about Uesugi Kenshin, and build a diplomatic bridge between the two figures. Yoshiteru declared war on Miyoshi Nagayoshi because Miyoshi had a great influence in the capital. Nagayoshi continued as the real power in Kyoto. In 1565, Miyoshi Yoshitsugu laid siege against the Ninomaru Palace and Honmaru Palace (currently Nij≈ç Castle).

The Little Joes begin to aggressively pollinate, which Alice theorizes is because she has made them sterile. The same day Bella's dog, Bello, goes missing. Chris (Ben Whishaw) goes looking for him and accidentally inhales some of the pollen. Later on he takes Alice out and despite her obvious reluctance attempts to kiss her twice. The following day Bella finds Bello in the lab. He attacks her and she insists that he has changed. Chris later tells Alice that Bella is mentally ill and had previously attempted suicide before being forced on a year-long sabbatical, returning only shortly before Alice began working at the lab. Alice later learns that Bella had Bello put down. Bella tells Alice that the changes to Bello were due to the plant. Alice's son is accidentally pollinated by the plant and begins to act strangely, sneaking his classmate Selma into the lab and stealing a Little Joe. He later tells Alice that he is considering moving in with his father, Ivan. Bothered by her son's behaviour, Alice begins to examine test footage of subjects who have been exposed to the pollen. In every case their family members report that they are acting strangely and have seemed to change since the pollen test. However, just as Alice begins to believe Bella's suspicions, Bella is exposed to the pollen herself and dismisses her previous beliefs as paranoia due to her mental issues. Joe reveals that he and Selma stole the plant in order to pollinate Ivan, confirming Alice's suspicions that her plant carries a virus, especially as she has used unorthodox methods to create Little Joe. However, this turns out to be a joke as Chris previously talked to Joe about Alice's concerns. At work Bella reveals that she never inhaled the pollen and was only pretending to be happy in order to blend in with the others; she later tries to commit suicide. After Alice's boss dismisses her concerns she takes matters into her own hands and decides to kill the Little Joes before they are commercialized, lowering the temperature in the lab. She is stopped by Chris, who, in trying to prevent her from harming the plants, knocks her out on the floor of the lab, exposing her to the plant pollen. Later Alice learns that Little Joe has been nominated for an award, meaning that the plant will be sold worldwide. When Chris apologizes for hitting her she kisses him, and later dismisses her concerns as paranoia. She allows Joe to move in with his father and starts a new, happier life with her own Little Joe.

It was premiered at McMillin Theatre, Columbia University in New York City on May 11, 1946 by a Juilliard School student ensemble. In his Memos, Ives referred to the quartet as \\"one of the best things I have.\\" In a review of a September 1946 performance by the Walden Quartet at Yaddo, composer Lou Harrison wrote: \\"This work is... the finest piece of American chamber music yet... Music of this kind happens only every fifty years or a century, so rich in faith and so full of the sense of completion.\\" Form and content The quartet is a programmatic work depicting four men who \\"converse, discuss, argue (in re 'Politick'), fight, shake hands, shut up ‚Äì then walk up the mountain side to view the firmament!\\" Author Matthew McDonald wrote that the quartet \\"is the only multi-movement work Ives completed after The Celestial Country... whose movements all belong to an 'original grand conception,' as opposed to being partially or completely culled from earlier pieces,\\" and that \\"Ives conceived of the quartet movements as integrated components of a single musical narrative.\\" According to music historian and theorist Robert P. Morgan, the quartet \\"reveals a radical departure from traditional quartet writing. In keeping with the dramatic conception suggested by the titles of the movements, Ives treats the four instruments with an unprecedented degree of individuality: each has its own special character, and the overall quality of the work results from a sort of forced amalgamation of the four different textural components.\\" The work is in three movements: #Discussions (Andante moderato-Andante con spirito-Adagio molto) #Arguments (Allegro con spirito) #The Call of the Mountains (Adagio- Andante-Adagio) Discussions, the first movement, begins quietly but soon becomes agitated, playing off one instrument against another. Jan Swafford wrote: \\"In this movement the programmatic idea of a heated conversation is rendered by complex, chromatic, dissonant counterpoint. The lines, modeled on speech, tend to sound like conversation. Periodically the instruments join in rhythmic unison, representing points of agreement in the discussion. Otherwise the four voices are distinct in a more traditionally contrapuntal way, the mostly atonal harmonies producing a sonority close to what Schoenberg was developing during the same period, a continent away.\\" After a climactic outburst, \\"serious discussion is again resumed, and eventually the movement ends much as it began.\\" (In the manuscript, Ives notes \\"Enough discussion for us!\\" at the movement's conclusion.) Arguments, the second movement, is \\"one of Ives's most original conceptions.\\" It starts out with the instruments gruffly and loudly asserting themselves one by one, and soon each instrument establishes its own distinctive musical and expressive \\"vocabulary.\\" This culminates in a passage during which the violins play in 4/4 time while the viola and cello play in 3/8, followed by a role reversal, with the violins playing in 3/8 and the others in 4/4. All the instruments then resume playing in 2/4 time, but this is interrupted by a clich√©d, sentimental, overtly tonal cadenza marked \\"Andante Emasculata\\" played by the second violin, during which it attempts to \\"establish 'traditional' musical order amongst the aggressively heterogeneous parts.\\" (Here the second violin represents \\"Rollo\\", a fictitious character who \\"represented all that was safe, conservative, and thus reprehensible in music.\\" The manuscript states \\"Nice and pretty, Rollo\\" at this point.) The other three instruments respond with a dissonant fff passage marked \\"Allegro con fisto,\\" recalling the opening of the movement. This is followed by another \\"Andante Emasculata\\" cadenza by the second violin, to which the others respond in a similarly brusque manner. After a quiet passage marked \\"Largo sweetota\\" and another outburst, there is a loud, dense section, after which the second violin drops out, only to return, insistently playing exaggeratedly regular rhythms against the other instruments' constantly- changing subdivisions. The instruments briefly come together, playing in rhythmic unison, but things soon fall apart in a passage marked \\"Allegro con fuoco (all mad)\\" that again recalls the opening. The instruments again attempt to unite, but lapse into dissonant outbursts as before. Finally, following a C-major passage played in rhythmic unison, there is a brief, quiet, open- string pause for breath marked \\"Andante con scratchy (as tuning up),\\" followed by a final fff eruption marked \\"Allegro con fistiswatto (as a K.O.).\\" According to McDonald, the final movement, The Call of the Mountains, is \\"music that epitomizes Ives's transcendental ideal of unity in diversity, four musical layers that are rhythmically and melodically independent but together forge a continuous tonality that evokes timelessness and eternity.\\" He suggests that \\"the apotheosis of 'The Call of the Mountains' is Ives‚Äôs own music of the future.\\" In keeping with the program (\\"walking up the mountain side to view the firmament\\"), the instruments slowly unite in their efforts to achieve their goal, culminating in a \\"transcendental\\" ostinato passage during which the cello plays a slow, majestic descending whole tone scale beginning and ending on D, strongly reminiscent of the ending of the last movement of Ives' Symphony No. 4, completed several years after the composition of the quartet. Swafford described the ending as follows: \\"Over a downstriding whole- tone scale in the cello, the violins and viola chime like great bells in the heavens, in patterns like bell ringing. The struggle and the arguments have prepared the way for a revelation.\\" McDonald wrote: \\"The communal act with which the program ends is signified by the balance between instrumental independence and cohesion. The four debaters maintain their individuality yet form some sort of consensus as a means of peaceful coexistence; the opposition between individual and community is resolved. The four men‚Äôs communion with nature on the mountaintop is evoked by the first violin, which reaches higher on its E-string than most composers or players of the time would have dared to attempt, as it paraphrases the hymn 'Nearer My God to Thee'..., the title suggesting the ultimate object of the ascent up the mountain. God's eternity is rendered by the circularity of each of the lower three instrumental layers, whose ostinati repeat at different periodicities.\\" Influence D√∂rte Schmidt has noted that the \\"formal dramaturgy\\" of Elliott Carter's String Quartet No. 2 was inspired by Ives' quartet, and wrote that Carter established the use of highly individual instrumental characteristics as \\"the point of departure for the form of his Second Quartet, in which two types of interaction can be traced through the nine formal units lasting only about twenty minutes in total: egalitarian cooperation and dominance or confrontation.\\" (Carter helped organize the 1946 all-Ives concert that featured the premiere of the quartet, as well as the premieres of The Unanswered Question and Central Park in the Dark.) Robert Moevs suggested that Carter's String Quartet No. 3 is also indebted to \\"...the unreconstructedly dissonant superpositions of Charles Ives. To him may be due the very premise of this quartet elsewhere, that of separate groups on either side, playing at the same time their own music at their own tempo.\\" Moevs wrote that \\"the concept of dramatis personae, individuals of differing character whose nature and conflicts generate respectively the material and the structure, lies at the origin of\\" Ives' second quartet, and goes on to list specific passages in the Ives quartet in terms of their commonalities with Carter's work, such as \\"the division into Duos with conflicting meters,\\" \\"a protest of first violin, viola and cello against the sentimentalism of the second violin (opposition of character), and \\"conflicting beat subdivision... against a steady pulse.\\" Moevs noted that \\"what in Ives was defiant, sometimes outrageously incongruous, is in Carter tamed and exploited by professional system.\\" Although he did not draw explicit parallels with Ives' quartet, Robert Hurwitz noted that Carter's second and third quartets \\"can... be heard in terms of the anthropomorphism of the instruments,\\" stating how, in the second quartet, \\"the viola plays... an expressive, almost lamentable cadenza to be confronted with explosions of what may be anger or ridicule by the other three\\" (similar to the Arguments movement of Ives' quartet) and suggesting that Carter's \\"Third Quartet can be heard as a play, or a debate, or a conversation.\\" Brian Ferneyhough wrote the following regarding the final movement of his own String Quartet No. 4: \\"The 'story-line' of the four instruments is perhaps comparable to Charles Ives' Second String Quartet, where everyone is evolving, complaining or being boring in his own inimitable fashion.\\" Quotations As characteristic of Ives' style, he quotes American tunes including \\"Dixie's Land\\", \\"Marching Through Georgia\\", \\"Turkey in the Straw\\", \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\", \\"Massa in De Cold Ground\\", \\"Bethany\\", \\"Nettleton\\", and \\"Westminster Chimes\\", alongside quotations from works of Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and even Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" theme.

It stars S√¥nia Braga, Udo Kier, B√°rbara Colen, Thomas Aquino, Silvero Pereira and Karine Teles. The film, a co-production between Brazil and France, revolves around Bacurau, a fictional small town in the Brazilian sert√£o, which is beset by strange happenings following the death of its matriarch at the age of 94. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, and won the Jury Prize. Plot In the near future, the people of Bacurau, a fictional settlement in the also fictional municipality of Serra Verde, in western Pernambuco, witness a series of unusual events, including telephone signals going down, the settlement unexplainably disappearing from online maps, flying saucer-shaped drones chasing travelers and a couple of motor bikers from Rio de Janeiro passing by. This all happens after the death of Carmelita, a matriarch of the village, and villagers and other relatives have gathered for her funeral. During this time we learn there is a dispute over water rights from the local river, with water being dammed upstream in a collusion of which the mayor of Serra Verde, Tony Junior (Thardelly Lima), is a part. He visits Bacurau in his re-election campaign and is clearly despised by the people of the village. In the meantime, the villagers are forced to have water delivered by truck from a source farther upstream. One of the curious goings-on is that the truck is shot at, resulting in multiple leaks. When dozens of horses show up in town, two men are sent to investigate the nearby farm from where they presumably escaped and find out the whole family murdered. As the two men leave the property, they are executed by the couple on the motor bikes. This couple rendezvous with a group of foreigners led by Michael (Udo Kier) and are reprehended for killing the two men, since killing will allow the foreigners to score \\"points\\". After receiving unheard instructions through earpieces, the foreigners execute the motor-bike couple and argue over who did the killing and is entitled to more points. As the death toll rises and a 9-year-old boy is slaughtered in cold blood, Pacote (Thomas Aquino) deduces the town will be attacked and leads efforts to prepare the people to defend themselves. When the foreigners arrive, they are all killed by the locals, except for Michael, who ends up captured. Soon after the battle, Tony Junior, already persona non grata in Bacurau, comes to town and Michael calls his name; Tony denies knowing him. The mayor is sent away half-naked and tied up to a donkey while Michael is buried alive in an underground cell while shouting that \\"this is only the beginning\\".

The station was opened in 1878 and closed to passengers in 1960 with freight services being stopped in 1964. The station was opened by the Cleveland Railway, which was absorbed by the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1865. At the grouping, services were provided by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). History The Cleveland Railway opened up a line eastwards from Guisborough in 1862 which reached Boosbeck in that year and made it to in 1865 and in 1866. This provided a connection with the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway (W&RMU;) in 1875 when they built their line through . The line through Boosbeck, which was opposed vehemently by the Stockton & Darlington Railway, was originally intended to be a way of moving iron ore from the various mines in the Cleveland Hills. As such, the stations along the line did not open until some time later as passengers were not an immediate concern. Even when stations were opened in 1875 at most of the locations on the line, Boosbeck did not open until three years later in 1878. A station was first proposed at a cost of ¬£2,100 in April 1874, when other stations on the line were also proposed (Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus) which were built and opened in 1875. The design of the station was down to the architect William Peachey, who was working for the North Eastern Railway. The plans were shelved for two years, being revived in June 1876, though with the costs revised by a 33% cut in expenditure. Passenger services at the station ran from Middlesbrough to Brotton, via the line at and a reversal at . In 1938, thirteen out and back workings were listed in timetables as stopping in the station, with eight out and back services on Sundays. In NER days, the service pattern on the line was Middlesbrough-Guisborough-Saltburn. In 1933, the LNER made a change to the train services, which saw most to Middlesbrough trains diverted over the line as opposed to the previous route direct past . However, not all of these services called at Boosbeck, but rules were relaxed to let the services reverse into, and out of, Guisborough. The service pattern was changed again in 1958, when the line from Loftus to was closed due to corrosion in the iron viaducts on the line. The station had two platforms, a crane and was capable of handling goods and livestock. The station was closed to passengers in May 1960, after which, it became an unstaffed public delivery siding. It was served by a circular freight train from Newport Yard in Middlesbrough that ran eastwards through the station. The west facing line was not in regular use as the return trip went via Saltburn. The station was closed to goods traffic in September 1964. The line west of the station was closed in 1963, and closure of the line eastwards towards Brotton came at the same time as the closure to goods in 1964. The stationmasters house has survived in private ownership.

Art Nouveau meets Russian Revival style Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture and applied arts, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1893 and 1910. In the Russian language it is called Art Nouveau or Modern (in Cyrillic: –ê—Ä-–Ω—É–≤o, –ú–æ–¥–µÃÅ—Ä–Ω). Vitebsky railway station, by Sima Mihash and Stanislav Brzozowski (1904) Art Nouveau architecture in Russia was mostly built in large cities by merchants and Old Believers, and was highly influenced by the contemporary movements Lecture on Art Nouveau of Alexander Ivanov (in Russian) that constituted the Art Nouveau style: the Glasgow School, Jugendstil of Germany, Vienna Secession, as well as Russian Revival architecture and the National Romantic style of Nordic countries (one of which, Grand Duchy of Finland, was a part of Russian Empire) In some Russian towns, there also were earlier examples of wooden architecture, the architecture of Kievan Rus', which influenced the style. Some Russian Art Nouveau buildings were built on territories that were part of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Finland during the Art Nouveau period and were ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. Russian architects also worked on the development of Harbin in China after 1898, which explains the presence of Art Nouveau architecture there.  Saint Petersburg  Hauswald summer house - the first Art Nouveau building in Russia The first Art Nouveau building in Russia was built in Saint Petersburg in 1898. It was Hauswald summer house built by Vladimir Chagin and Vasily (Wilhelm) Schoene. As Saint Petersburg was situated close to the border with Grand Duchy of Finland, there was a strong influence of its National Romantic style on Art Nouveau Architecture in Saint Petersburg. This style is called \\"Severny modern\\" in Russia (in Cyrillic: –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –º–æ–¥–µ—Ä–Ω) meaning \\"Northern Art Nouveau\\". But European movements influenced local architecture as well. =Notable examples= Seven Saint Petersburg buildings are sometimes considered as notable examples of Art Nouveau, List of Art Nouveau objects in Saint Petersburg - Art Nouveau World all by different architects: * Eliseyev Emporium by Gavriil Baranovsky (1903), * Whiplash motifs at the Vitebsky railway station by Sima Mihash and Stanislav Brzozowski (1904), * Singer House by Pavel Suzor (1904), * Duke of Leuchtenberg apartments by Fyodor von Postels (1904‚Äì1905), most notable for its facade-wide frieze by Sergei Schelkovy, * Kshessinskaya House by Alexander von Hohen (1904‚Äì1906), * Lidval apartments by Fyodor Lidval (also known as Johan Fredrik Lidvall, 1899‚Äì1904), * Basseynaya Condominium by Ernest Wirrich, Aleksei Zazersky, Nikolai Vasilyev, Aleksei Bubyr (1912‚Äì1917).

Kekushev was acquainted with Victor Horta, the initiator of Art Nouveau movement, and the house shows the natural curving forms, open interiors and floral designs of Horta. Kekushev's buildings are notable for his skilful use of ceramic and iron ornaments. His buildings also have a signature feature: a ceramic depiction on the facade or a sculpture of a lion, or 'Lev', after his first name. Prominent buildings by Lev Kekushev in Art Nouveau style include: * List House (1898‚Äì99) * Kekushev House, also known as Kekusheva House, as he had to cede it to his ex-wife in settling their divorce, (1900‚Äì1903), * Mindovsky House and Nosov House (both in 1903), * Isakov Apartments (1904‚Äì1906). Lev Kekushev also took part in the construction of the Hotel Metropol Moscow. In 1898‚Äì1899, he won the first prize in the open contest, but the commissioner of the project Savva Morozov discarded the decision of a professional jury and awarded the prize to William Walcot. However, the owners retained Kekushev as an overall project manager. Kekushev's assistance was probably crucial to the final realization of the complex structure.William Craft Brumfield, \\"The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture\\", University of California Press, 1991 contents chapter 3 File:List_House_2014.jpgList House (1898-99) File:Moscow, Ostozhenka 21 (41778247090).jpgA lion's statue on top of Kekushev House File:Kekushev_Povarskaya_Street.jpgMindovsky House File:Moscow,_Prechistenka_28_May_2008_05.JPGMetal ornament of Isakov Apartments File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫_–ù–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞01.jpgNosov House File:Wiki_Metropol_Hotel_Moscow_Artwork_2.jpgMaiolica panel of Mikhail Vrubel and bas-reliefs at the facade of Hotel Metropol =Franz (Fyodor) Schechtel= Another influential master of Russian Art Nouveau who worked in Moscow was Franz (Fyodor) Schechtel. Starting his career with Neo-Gothic buildings and finishing career with Neoclassical ones, he built his best-known masterpieces in Art Nouveau style. In 1901 he was commissioned to build the pavilion of Russia at Glasgow Exhibition. There he gained international recognition and got to know Charles Rennie Mackintosh who influenced Schechtel's art. Another influence was Joseph Maria Olbrich, the founder of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony, whose Ludwig Habich House was an inspiration for the Gorky Museum (1900‚Äì1903). Lecture of Ilya Pechenkin on Art Nouveau style and method (in Russian) His other works in Moscow included: List of Art Nouveau objects in Moscow - Art Nouveau World * (1901), * Yaroslavsky railway station (1902‚Äì1904).

Early life McLean was born in New York City on December 8, 1818. He was a son of Cornelius McLean (1787‚Äì1853) and Hannah (n√©e Hammond) McLean (d. 1839), who married in 1807. His younger brother was George Washington McLean, who served as Major in command of the Old Guard. His paternal grandparents were Elizabeth (n√©e Swaim) McLean and Charles McLean, a descendant of the Clan Maclean of the Isle of Mull in Scotland. His maternal grandfather was Lt. Col. James Hammond, a prominent member of the First Regiment of Westchester County of the New York Militia, during the Revolutionary War. Career After a private school education, he began his career with the Guardian Fire Insurance Company, founded by John Jacob Astor and Robert Lenox (father of James Lenox). In 1847, McLean began working for the Citizens Fire Insurance Company, later serving as Secretary and President for nearly forty years. Beginning in 1860, McLean was elected and served as president of the New York Board of Fire Underwriters for four years. In this role, he was a \\"prominent factor in creating harmony among local fire insurance companies, and in establishing the present Fire Department.\\" Upon the formation of the National Board of Fire Underwriters in 1866, he served as its first president and was reelected to a second term. McLean also served as president, and long-time director, of the Manhattan Life Insurance Company (following the resignation of Henry Stokes), an original director and co-founder of the Manhattan Savings Bank, an original director of the National City Bank (predecessor bank of Citibank), and vice-president of the Union Trust Company. In addition to his corporate work, McLean served as president of the New York City Board of Education for four years, was a trustee of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge, and served as president of the Institute for the Blind. In 1873, he became the 20th President of the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, a charitable organization in New York City of men who are descended from early inhabitants of the State of New York. Personal life In 1840, McLean was married to Louisa Theresa Williams (d. 1857). Together, they were the parents of: * George Hammond McLean (1849‚Äì1913), a founder of the Lambs Club who married Harriet Amelia \\"Minnie\\" Dater, a daughter of Henry Dater. * Cornelius McLean (b. 1841), who married Rebecca Hyslop. McLean died of pneumonia in New York City on May 13, 1890. After a funeral held at his residence, he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His family owned McLean Island on the Long Island Sound near Stamford, Connecticut. =Descendants= Through his son George, he was the grandfather of James Clarence Hammond McLean (1879‚Äì1956) and Alan Dater McLean (1889‚Äì1946), who married Florence Sims Wyeth in 1913. Florence was the only daughter of Dr. John Allan Wyeth and sister of Marion Sims Wyeth and John Allan Wyeth Jr..

History The hospital, which was designed by Thomas Chambers Hine in the Italianate style using a corridor plan layout, opened as the Coppice Private Asylum in August 1859. Two new wings, designed by George Thomas Hine, the original architect's son, were completed in the 1880s. Although initially established as a private asylum for fee-paying patients, the facility was owned by the Nottingham County Council and being unable to compete with the state, it joined the National Health Service as the Coppice Hospital in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1985. The main buildings were subsequently converted into apartments as Hine Hall. Meanwhile, a modern mental health facility known as the Springwood Centre was established near the old hospital, although this has also since closed.

It took its name from the alley on which it was located and was run since the 1990s by the Vrijplaats Koppenhinksteeg Foundation. Various groups including Eurodusnie used the different spaces as a bar, caf√©, a freeshop, a foundation to support undocumented migrants, an information centre, a library and a sports club. In 2010, the entire complex was evicted. From 2012 onwards a new space called the Vrijplaats Leiden (Freespace Leiden) was set up elsewhere. Occupation The buildings which comprised the former Eduard IJdo printers complex were squatted in 1968. Initially spaces were used by a feminist printers, a leftwing bookshop and different activist groups. Projects in 1990s * Bar en Boos (Horrible and Angry) - a bar. When it opened in 1993, the Leidsche Dagblad newspaper described it as \\"an angry squatters bar full of PLO scarves.\\" * Linkse Kerk (Las Vegas) - a caf√© and activity centre. * Free shop. * Hong Ying Centre - a sports school. * De Fabel van de illegaal - a foundation working with undocumented migrants. * Library - with texts about antifascism, the environment, feminism and the Developing World. * Marinus van der Lubbe room - used by groups such as a women's choir, a Syrian group and local artists * 'Dusnieuws' - a monthly political zine. * 'Koekoeroe Reedio' - a radio station. * Organic chaos productions - an activist video distribution network 2006 problems In 2006, the cafe project Linkse Kerk was shut down by police when it re-opened after refurbishments. The police stated it did not have the correct permits and did not meet fire regulations. Five people were arrested and quickly released. Eviction Up until July 2008, the council was willing to legalize the centre. The plan was to transfer ownership to the housing association Ons Doel for 1 euro and then to renovate. When the council became more rightwing after elections, the building was sold to a property developer instead. The entire freespace was then evicted in 2010. There was an urgent appeal against the decision to evict but it was unsuccessful. New building The Vrijplaats Koppenhinksteeg Foundation purchased a monumental building at 36 Middelstegracht in 2012. When the renovations had been carried out, the intention was to house all the groups from the previous location still needing a space. This was after negotiations for a different building on the Vrouwekerkplein had fallen through.

Richard Davies (1862 ‚Äì February 1938) was a Welsh trade unionist and political activist. The president of one union, and general secretary of another, he also served as a city councillor and contested numerous Parliamentary elections. Born in South Wales, Davies worked as a shop assistant in Cardiff for a couple of years, then became a journalist, focusing on reporting the labour movement. By 1897, he was an organiser for the Navvies, Bricklayers' Labourers and General Labourers' Union based at Barry. He was imprisoned for six weeks after being convicted of intimidating a strikebreaker. He retained the backing of the union, and after his release, was elected as its president. In 1898, Davies moved to Leicester, to become the Midland Counties organiser of the Navvies' Union. However, the union's general secretary, John Ward, refused to allow him to see the union's books. Davies took Ward to court, but Ward did not attend, and the union's executive committee expelled Davies from the union. Davies won election as a Labour Party member of Leicester City Council. In 1904, he was appointed as the first full-time organiser of the Municipal Employees' Association, while also serving as one of its district secretaries. In 1907, the union's general secretary, Albin Taylor resigned and set up the rival National Union of Corporation Workers.Bernard Dix and Stephen Williams, Serving the Public: Building the Union, pp.42-208 Davies was elected to replace him, and managed to increase the membership of the union. In 1908, the union selected him as a Prospective Parliamentary Candidate, once a suitable constituency was located, but no seat was found, and he stood down as general secretary of the union in 1913. Davies moved to Plymouth and became a builder. He was selected by the Labour Party to contest the 1921 Hastings by-election. He took second place, and stood again in the 1922 and 1923 United Kingdom general elections. He next stood in the 1928 Tavistock by-election, and contested the seat again in the 1929 and 1931 United Kingdom general elections. In 1933, he gave a speech in the town which the Western Morning News reported as being anti-semitic. The Labour Party's national leadership rebuked him for this, but he maintained his position and was therefore dropped as a candidate. In February 1938, Davies suffered a fall, and died from resulting complications, aged 75.

The Purr-tenders are five colorful cats who wear carnival-like masks trying to pretend that they are a different animal. Hugging the toy triggered a purring noise, powered by AA batteries. By November 21, 1988 they also came as puppets called Sock-Ems (except for Chirp-purr). Purr-Tenders =Premise= The Purr-tenders originally came from the Pick-A-Dilly pet store, where people bought exotic pets. Nobody showed any interest in the cats, so they decided to don on animal masks and act like animals that corresponded with their new look, adopting the title Purr-Tender. Shortly afterwards they were adopted. While enjoying their new lives, they struggled to keep the fact that they were really cats secret from humans, exposed only by their purring sound. =Characters= *Hop-Purr - A purple cat who wears pink bunny ears and nose. She often leads the other Purr-Tenders in their adventures. His owner is Amy Poole. *Flop-purr - A black cat who wears a yellow beak and flippers. Often he is the acting leader of the group. His owner is Kevin Evans *Romp-purr - A yellow cat who wears purple puppy ears and a blue nose. Mostly she's a tomboy and the brawn of the group. *Scamp-purr - A white cat who wears purple mouse ears and nose. She is kind of timid, but tends to think up helpful ideas. *Chirp-purr - A pink cat who wears a toucan beak and crest. What she lacks in flight, she makes up for in climbing and singing. Her owner is Anita Rose. *Mr. Bungle - The owner of the Pick-A-Dilly pet store. He takes good care of the pets and is allergic to feathers. *Ed-grr - Mr. Bungle's mean retriever dog who attempts to expose the Purr-Tenders, cage them and have them sent back to the pet shop they came from. Sales and Promotion By April 1988, Hallmark had released a number of books starring the Purr-tenders. Later around Halloween, the Purr-tenders was an inspiration for dressing up and pretending in a safe manner. By December that same year, the Purr-Tenders were among the successful selling toys in Kansas. In Indiana, Burger King donated Purr-Tender toys to Riley Hospital, while selling several more to customers to raise extra funds for the hospital. A few days after that, Riley received a visit from a Scamp-Purr mascot bearing gifts, compliments of Burger King. In Ohio, the local Burger King and Elyria High School students promoted the sale of the stuffed toys. In addition a Purr- tender mascot came to Broad Street on December the 20th. Both promotional activities aided in raising funds and awareness for the \\"Chemical Abuse Reduced through Education\\" project. A few days before Christmas, Curly Neal handed out Purr-tender stuffed toys from Burger King to the Children's Hospital of Michigan. Around this time, sales of those toys, raised money for the adoption agency Spaulding for Children.

History The current building dates from 1900 and it was designed by James Pearson Alison. This was the same year as Jedburgh Library was opened. It was built on the foundations of a previous building and basement rooms are from that former use as a malt barn. These rooms had been used as the town armoury. The town needed a public building as the Corn Exchange, which had stood in the market place, burnt down in 1898.

The hall was used by \\"C\\" Squadron of the Lothians and Border Horse and for \\"A\\" Company of the 4th battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers. In 1918 it was a scene of celebration when war hero John Daykins VC was honoured at the hall. John Daykins VC welcomed at the hall in 1918 The novelist, playwright and creator of Peter Pan, J. M.

In 1975 an information centre was attached and the hall became a class B listed building on 23 March 1993. The hall was run and owned by the local council but in 2015 the costs of ownership became onerous and it and the management of many other public buildings in the borders were transferred to a trust. The building was available to let and it is the location for the local flower show, birl'n'beer and music evenings. In early 2020 it was proposed that the hall might be sold, but a petition caused the council to pause the proposed closures.

He was the squire and Starost of Ulan√≥w (today Ulaniw), Bar (1540-1552) and Trembowla (1552-1561, today Terebovlia).Welcome to Terebovlya (Trembowla / Terebovla) Prittwitz was at that time Polish national hero and received after his military successes two honor names, which held themselves over generations: Bart≈Çomiej Paprocki (1540-1614), the founder of the Polish heraldry, designated him in 1575 as \\"Terror Tartarorum\\", the \\"Terror of the Tartars\\" and \\"Krzysztof Warszewicki\\" ( Varsevitius , 1543-1603) called him 'Murus Podoliae' in 1598, the Wall of Podolia in order to successfully fight against the many raids of the Islamic Crimean Tatars and Nogai Tatars, those who settled in Budjak, Yedisan and Dobruja.  Family  Prittwitz was the son of the landowner Peter von Prittwitz , gentleman on the estates Gaffron, Rippin, Mangsch√ºtz and Kraschen (region Gro√ü Wartenberg), Stronn (region Oels), as well as Haideberg and Myslni√≥w (region Schildberg), and the Ludmila of Stwolinsky . The Russian General of the Cavalry, Carl Baron von Prittwitz later said that he had repeatedly heard the rumor during his long stay in Poland, and especially in Warsaw, Bernhard's father Peter was already voivode of Podolia and had a love affair with Queen Bona Sforza, the wife of King Sigismund I of Poland. This should probably justify the personal benefits of Bernhard by Queen Bona (see below). But there were countless rumors about the foreign queen. Details about his first wife are unknown. From this marriage he had a son Albert . In his second marriage in 1551 he was married to Barbara Zawadzka, also known as Branczlikowna, with whom he had son Jakob and a daughter. 'Jakob' 'later became Voivode. This 'Prittwitz' family living in Poland died out very soon.  Life  = Polish Captain (until 1540) = family coat of arms Wczele or Szachownica (chessboard) Prittwitz probably came from Silesia to Poland at a young age and entered the service of the Polish King Sigismund I, who before his accession Duke of Glogau and Opole, as well as royally- Bohemian governor of his elder brother, the King Vladislav of Bohemia and Hungary had been in Silesia. Both may have known each other from that time. Perhaps also because his father Peter had already been in Polish military service, since he owned two goods in Poland. In any case, son Bernhard is already mentioned in 1526 as a man at the Polish royal court. Later he also served as his successor Sigismund II of Poland. In 1537, Prittwitz is called a royal Captain and commander a flock of 120 horsemen. But probably since 1530 he provided his service in the border area to the \\"Tatar Empire\\". At that time, all the enemies of Christianity s and all non-Christian peoples of the Orient were called Tartars, predominantly the Turks. The city of Bar as well as the neighboring towns of Trembowla and Ulan√≥w had been invaded by Tartars in earlier times. By 1538 Prittwitz must have already achieved first great merit in the fight against the Tartars and thus also the favor of Queen Bona Sforza, an Italian, because the Queen finally obtained the king, that contrary to the prevailing opinion of the \\"foreigner\\" Prittwitz im In 1538, the large estates around Koniacyn, in present-day Vinnytsia Oblast, were donated. But after all, Prittwitz's successes meant that he had to report in 1538/1539 even before the Polish Reichstag report. Also in 1539 Queen Bona provided for further benefits: It was left to Prittwitz city and Scharawka Castle (55 km northwest of Bar) with all its goods for lifelong use, from 1550 as property. = Starost of Ulan√≥w, Bar and Trembowla (from 1540) = Finally, in 1540, Queen Bona entrusted him with the office of Starost of Bar, whose district belonged to her own. As a starost in the confines of Poland, Bernard Pretwicz's main mission was to protect Podolia from Tatar expeditions that devastated the region every year. With the income of the starostie, he managed to maintain a regular troupe to defend the province against the Tatar attacks. The resources of the starostie being insufficient, it engaged many Cossacks who often paid themselves by plundering the lands of the sultan, sometimes supplying them weapons and clothes. The pay of a Cossack was in any case half as high as that of a horse archer. The other starosts of the confines Fyodor Sanguszko, starost of Bratslav and Vinnytsia on the Southern Bug, and Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, staroste of Kaniv and Cherkasy on the Dnieper did the same. At that time, only Polish noblemen were appointed to a \\"Starost\\" (Polish district administrator), which became - with the royal goods lying in this district - mostly hereditary - feud. Both in peace and in wartime, the Starost was the district captain, so in addition to his post as head of administration at the same time military Commander in Chief. So the appointment of a \\"foreigner\\" like Prittwitz to the Starost was an extraordinary honor. Signature of Bernhard von Prittwitz as Captain on Bar in 1550: \\"Berhanrth prytwycz, Haupman auff baur with meyner eygen Hannth schryff\\" Prittwitz became \\"the man of providence for the Podolian lands\\" (source: Pulaski ): The small fortress bar offered shelter and food for only 30 men. Therefore, Prittwitz gradually built up a new type of defense system. From Cheremissen and Cossacks he formed his own troop of about 300 men, which he housed in smaller, well-mounted groups in castle-like fortifications in villages in the area. In the border areas he also positioned spies. For the first time Prittwitz made it impossible for the Tartars to unexpectedly invade Polish settlements in the Bar district. Because of the new \\"warning system\\" it was now possible to concentrate the \\"flying border protection\\" within a very short time at the endangered spot. Also new was that the enemy was even attacked and persecuted until it was wiped out, trapped or killed. Prittwitz is said to have won more than 70 battles with the Tatars over the years. His defense system and his fighting technique were therefore taken over by all Cossacks. Thus, the Silesian Prittwitz became one of the first great Cossack leaders.

His defense system and his fighting technique were therefore taken over by all Cossacks. Thus, the Silesian Prittwitz became one of the first great Cossack leaders. In March 1540, the Tatars had advanced to the city of Vinnytsia in northern Podolia. Prittwitz confronted them with a small group of Cossacks, drove them about 100 km to Ochakiv in the Jedisan, at that time one of the most important permanent places of the Ottoman Empire on the Black Sea, took away their rich prey and returned with Tatar women and children as prisoners. In 1541, Prittwitz invaded the Tartar territories again and pushed forward to Belgrad in the Budschak. In 1550, the Tartars, this time together with the Wallachians, re-entered the Polish Podolia and besieged the fortress bar, well equipped with weapons, with at least 56 large and 1,120 small barracks. Prittwitz resisted this time not only the siege and the attacks back, but brought the Tartars by their own breakout a great defeat. Later, when King Sigismund II August, out of political calculations, prohibited him from retaliating against the Tartars, Prittwitz instead provided better border and city fortifications within his area of responsibility. These safeguards were a prerequisite for the beginning of peaceful settlement. Thus, under the protection of the \\"glorious starost\\" Prittwitz, the entire region of Bar and Vinnytsia was populated, trade and agriculture began to flourish. During his tenure, not a single village in the Bar district has been cremated by Tatars. The fact is that many villages, towns and castles in Podolia have been rebuilt during this period.  Silesian homeland  In all years Prittwitz has never stopped his contact with his Silesian homeland and his own family in Silesia. For example, B is B. Correspondence known with Duke Albrecht I of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1551/1552), the Grand Master of the German Order or with the Brieger Duke George II (1554). Also, he had in his home the estate Stronn, which he shared in 1548 with his brother Balthasar . Prittwitz had probably met Duke Albrecht of Prussia, whose mother Sophie was the sister of King Sigismund I, perhaps at the Polish court. Or as a young man he had already been in the Duke's service; After all, he was also known in Silesia as a reiter horseman leader. Prittwitz was very open to Protestantism - like the entire family, which became Protestant early on. Therefore, Prittwitz tried to promote 12,000 soldiers for Duke Albrecht in Poland in support of the Protestant struggle.  \\"Terror Tartarorum\\"  Bernhard von Prittwitz, \\"Terror Tartarorum\\", 1541 (engraving from the 19th century after the original painting) Prittwitz's victorious battles against the Tatars, who after decades of suffering at the border finally made the population of Poland breathe a sigh of relief in the Tatar defense, had to attract a great deal of attention. He therefore enjoyed the greatest fame, greatest reverence and esteem even during his lifetime - especially among the Polish youth. For example, a grandson of Biecki, who served as King Sigismund I as a squire, explicitly asked for permission to learn equestrian service at Prittwitz. A legend also later reported: \\"Just as Osowski and Prittwitz told us that children who cried too much in the cradle were frightened by their names so that they would be silent.\\" (Source: Johann Sinapius ). Prittwitz died in Trembowla in 1561. But even after his death, the enemies are said to have fled at the mere sight of Polish hosts - in the belief that the \\"Terror Tartarorum\\" still command them. Many years later, Ukrainian Cossacks are said to have sung the \\"Tartar Terror\\" in their war songs. A Polish chronicler reported back in 1726 that Prittwitz still stood in high esteem 170 years after his death. And King John II Casimir Vasa is said to have set up a portrait of Prittwitz in his room. For his military achievements also speaks that only two years after Prittwitz 'death King Sigismund II in Poland a standing army erected to meet the renewed destruction in the border provinces by the Tartars, and long after his death the rhyme \\"Za Pana Pretfica wolna od Tatar granica\\" (At Prittwitz times the border was free of Tatars) was very popular in Poland. Prittwitz's gravestone once bore the inscription cited here in Latin: ::: Wanderer, behold, how uncertain man's dwelling is; ::: I came from Silesia; ::: Podolia praises the deceased; ::: 'I taught the art of war to the army;' ' ::: \\"I have cut down Tartars, Turks and Wallachians; '' ::: therefore I was dear to the great king of the Sarmatians, Sigismund I. ::: I have received honorary testimonies and am celebrated in my mouth; ::: now I will be covered by this little mound, ::: abandoned by all; ::: \\"I have neither treasures, nor piety, nor my fate helped; '' ::: not even my warfare took advantage of me; ::: So if you are religious, I ask you not to forget the Prittwitz if you pass by here.

J. Waring in July 1861. Early life and career William B. Tillman was born in Milford, Delaware, in around 1834. Although most black Delawareans of his time were born into slavery, Tillman belonged to a family of free blacks. They relocated to Rhode Island around 1850, after which Tillman began working as sailor, eventually to be hired by Jonas Smith & Co. Recapture of the Waring The eight-year-old schooner S. J. Waring, owned by Jonas Smith & Co., set sail from New York on July 4, 1861, with Tillman among her ten-man crew. Three days later, the ship was seized by Confederate privateers who decided to sell Tillman into slavery after docking at their intended destination, Charleston. Fiercely resistant to becoming a slave, Tillman enlisted fellow Waring sailor William Stedding's help in recapturing the ship. On July 16, Tillman waited until dark and struck both the captain and second mate multiple times in the head with a hatchet that he had hidden from the Confederates. A first mate who awoke was also killed in a similar fashion. The wounded men were thrown overboard to die, one of them being heard to call out after he hit the water. The entire operation took only eight minutes. The remaining Southern shipmen were caged and Tillman assumed captaincy of the Waring, which he successfully navigated back to New York Harbor, reaching it on July 21. Tillman and Stedding were warmly received by the police, journalists, and curious onlookers alike. When asked if he had encountered any \\"difficulty\\" in mastering the men he had killed, Tillman replied: No criminal charges were filed against Tillman. He and Stedding were approached by Phineas T. Barnum to make appearances at his museum; however, audience response was varied, with some denigrating William Tillman as a \\"villain\\" and \\"murderer\\". For his efforts in recapturing the Waring, Tillman was awarded seven thousand dollars by a Judge Shipman on February 6, 1862, after a salvage trial was established by the same judge on October 28 of the preceding year. The award was affirmed on May 13, 1862, after an appeal by Jonas Smith & Co. Jonas Smith's legal team had unsuccessfully argued that Tillman and the other salvors were not entitled to salvage because they were \\"ignorant of navigation\\" and, in Tillman's case, had acted out of selfish intent. Later years Tillman wed housekeeper Julia Prophet on January 15, 1863. The couple had one son, Frederick ( 1869 ‚Äì ?). He registered for conscription in June of the same year but it is not known if he actually performed military service during the Civil War. The date and place of his death are unknown; historian Gerald Henig asserts that \\"no verifiable evidence\\" exists to account for Tillman's final years. Legacy Many of Tillman's contemporaries, including notable figures in the African-American community, paid tribute to him. Frederick Douglass likens him to the slave rebels Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey in his August 1861 Douglass' Monthly column titled \\"A Black Hero\\", adding that Tillman \\"walked to his work of self-deliverance with a step as firm and dauntless as the noblest Roman of them all\\". Booker T. Washington devotes two pages of his 1900 work A New Negro for a New Century to narrating Tillman's recapture of the schooner and praising him for being \\"as brave as a lion\\". Tillman's story was retold in several contemporaneous publications, including The Bugle Blast (1864) and The Rebel Pirate's Fatal Prize (1865). Stories on Tillman also ran in Scientific American, Harper's Weekly, and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly. A writer for the New-York Tribune remarked that the Union was \\"indebted\\" to William Tillman \\"for the first vindication of its honour on the sea\\". The Herald described Tillman as \\"the splendid son of Africa\\" while predicting that his name \\"will now become historic as the enacter of as great a piece of daring and heroism as perhaps the world ever saw.\\" Similar sentiments were echoed in other abolitionist pieces.

Early life Mount was born in New York City on September 3, 1814. He was the eldest son of Richard Edwards Mount (1786‚Äì1872) and Maria (n√©e Branson) Mount (1792‚Äì1873), who married in 1813. Among his younger siblings was Henry Ritter Mount and Charlotte Anne Mount. His maternal grandparents were Capt. Ware and Mary Branson. His paternal grandparents were Joseph Mount and Mary (n√©e Edwards) Mount. His father was \\"a wealthy citizen well known in the commercial circles of the metropolis for his business energy and probity.\\" In his early youth, he was known as \\"one of the men about town, the intimate companion of Halleck, Willis, and the elder Wallack, and gentlemen of their class.\\" Career Mount attended Columbia College, graduating with an A.B. degree in 1834 (alongside James William Beekman and Isaac C. Delaplaine) and an A.M. degree in 1837. After graduating from Columbia, Mount passed the bar and began practicing law after entering the law office founded by James Alexander, the 4th New Jersey Attorney General (who also served as attorney general for the Province of New York and was the father of William Alexander, Lord Stirling). Reportedly, Mount earned a fortune from practicing law, retiring after his father's death (after inheriting an \\"ample fortune\\") and four years before his own death in 1876.

For example, humans can recall a kettle and then mentally break a handle. The imaginary kettle with the broken handle, a horse without the tail, or a cow without the ear are novel objects since they were never before observed physically. The process of generating these objects in the mind is the process of image decomposition or analysis, as opposed to Prefrontal Synthesis that involves combining two or more objects together. On the neurological level, PFA is hypothesized to involve desynchronization of the part of an object-encoding neuronal ensemble (objectNE) from the rest of the ensemble. For example, when one imagines a kettle with a broken handle, the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) desynchronizes the handle from the rest of the objectNE of the kettle. LPFC- driven shift of a part of the objectNE out-of-phase with the rest of the ensemble, results in the perception of a new object encoded by those neurons that remain firing synchronously. PFA was coined in to define the component of active imagination acquired by the first stone tools makers Homo habilis and Homo erectus. Manufacturing a handaxe out of a cobble requires a mental template of the future handaxe. According to Ian Tattersall, ‚ÄúTo make a carefully shaped handaxe from a lump of rock not only demanded a sophisticated appreciation of how stone can be fashioned by fracture, but a mental template in the mind of the toolmaker that determined the eventual form of the tool.‚Äù In neurological terms, the ‚Äúmental template‚Äù is an objectNE encoded in the neocortex of the toolmaker. Critically, the mental template could not have been recalled from memory. It must have been actively imagined by the toolmaker by analyzing the objectNE encoding the original cobblestone. Since all attempts to teach stone tools manufacturing to apes have failed so far , it is suggested that PFA was acquired after humans have split from chimpanzee line 6 million years ago. Improvement of stone tools from Mode One to Mode two and Mode Three have been hypothesized to reflect improvements in PFA ability.

After the Tolleths, Gwen Alger purchased the house and became its second owner. Alger opened an antique shop at the house. Researchers for the City of Meridian found evidence that the Tolleth House was a Sears Catalog Home constructed from mail order plans sold by Sears, Roebuck and Company in their 1905 catalog.

By the 1930s, the union's membership was in long-term decline, and its executive decided to merge with the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). At the time it claimed 8,000 members, although this included unemployed members who paid no membership fees. Despite this, it was the largest union to join the NUGMW since its formation in 1924. The merger was enacted at the start of 1934, with Bennett and Slevin both retiring in the summer, while Ozanne continued working for the new union.

Dongolawi) are a collection of Nubian tribes and peoples in northern Sudan, primarily settling between the third Nile cataract and al Dabbah. Along with Halfawi, Sikot, Mahas, they form a significant part of the indigenous Nubian peoples in Sudan. In addition, they have historically lived in proximity to their Shaigiya and Ja'alin neighbors. They originally speak Andaandi which is one of the Nubian languages spoken in Northern Sudan & Southern Egypt. it is still spoken by the majority of the population along side with the Sudanese Arabic dialect.  History and Etymology  Originating from ancient Nubia , the word danagla comes from the plural form of the Nubian word meaning Red Brick. Danaglas are known to practice and preserve culture honouring the legacy of the Nubian civilisation. Although some Danagla have mixed with Arab tribes during the spread of Islam in Sudan and primarily during Anglo Egyption Sudan forming the Jabiriah, Badiriah and Hakamab tribes, most are believed to have remained mostly unmixed; a concept which danagla take pride in but is always under criticism and debate due to the ethnocentrism it sparks. Furthermore, some have been mixed with Mahas and other Nubian tribes.  Genetics  According to Y-DNA analysis by Hassan et al (2008), around 44% of Nubians and danaglas generally in Sudan carry the haplogroup J in individually varied but rather small percentages. The remainder mainly belong to the E1b1b clade (23%). Both paternal lineages are also common among local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. Thus it's observed that approximately 83% of their Nubian samples carried various subclades of the Africa-centered macrohaplogroup L. Of these mtDNA lineages, the most frequently borne clade was L3 (30.8%), followed by the L0a (20.6%), L2 (10.3%), L1 (6.9%), L4 (6.9%) and L5 (6.9%) haplogroups. The remaining 17% of Nubians belonged to sublineages of the Eurasian macrohaplogroups M (3.4% M/D, 3.4% M1) and N (3.4% N1a, 3.4% preHV1, 3.4% R/U6a1). These results can be used as rough estimates of genetics most Nubians hold.

He is well known for his involvement and activism during World War I and World War II. Early life Morize was born on September 18, 1883 at Le Fleix, France.Harvard Alumni Bulletin, December 12, 1918. In 1900, at the age of 16 he graduated with a Bachelier-√®s-lettres from the University of France, and won the Prix d‚Äôhonneur in the Councours General of the Lyc√©es. He continued his studies at the University of France and earned Licenci√©-√®s-lettres (1906) and Agr√©g√©-des- lettres (1907).While at the University of Paris, he worked under Joseph B√©dier and Gustave Lanson, specializing in modern and eighteenth-century French literature and culture. After graduating, Morize was a professor of French literature at University of Montauban from 1907 to 1910. He then worked at the University of Bordeaux for the next three years. Before joining the French Army at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was an associate professor of French literature at Johns Hopkins University from 1913 to 1914.

He became a lieutenant (1917) and then a captain (1917/18). On August 2, 1914, Morize was mobilized. He was wounded twice while in the field.Brockton (Mass) Times, 18 March 1919. He served in the Mulhouse campaign (August 1913); in the battles of Vosges, Arras, and Vermelles (December 1914); in the battles of Loos, Notre Dame de Lorette, Neuville-Saint-Vaast, Souchez (January‚ÄìMay 1916); at the Belgian Front (May 1916); in the battle of the Somme (July 1916‚ÄìJanuary 1917); and at the Alsace front (April 1917), before he was sent to the United States as part of a military training program. During the final years of the war, the French Army sent Morize to Harvard College as a military liaison, where he worked with their university-wide war efforts in keeping undergraduates fit and ready in case they were drafted. In his position as lecturer on Military Science and Tactics, Morize trained students on trench warfare and machine gun combat at Fresh Pond in Cambridge, MA, and was involved in campus events about the war.Harvard Crimson, May 29, 1940. Because of his service, Morize was decorated with the Croix de Guerre.  Professor at Harvard  As Morize prepared to return to France at the end of World War I, Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell invited him to stay on as a professor of French literature and culture.Boston Sunday Herald, January 7, 1951. He earned a Litt.D. from Middlebury College in 1925, where he also served as the director of the French summer school.French School, March 1940; Middlebury College Bulletin, March 1941; Boston Globe, January 15, 1950 While directing the summer school, he became a full professor in 1925, and eventually he became chair of the Department of History and Literature.French School, March 1940. He married professional musician and Boston socialite Ruth Muzzy Conniston on June 27, 1929.Boston Traveler, May 16, 1952. Their marriage ended in a well-documented divorce after Morize's retirement in 1952.  Involvement in World War II  On a vacation in France after directing the 1939 French summer school at Middlebury College, Morize found himself suddenly caught up in the second World War.Harvard Crimson, October 6, 1939. With no way of returning to the United States to begin his classes, Morize offered his help to the French government. He served in the French Ministry of Information until France was overrun by the German army and the Vichy government was installed.Harvard Crimson, October 6, 1939; Boston Herald, January 25, 1942; Boston Globe, March 17, 1943; Harvard Crimson, May 29, 1940. As a member of the French Bureau of North American Propaganda, Morize translated articles, periodicals, and speeches by French statesmen in order to keep the United States apprised of the war effort.Harvard Crimson, September 26, 1940. A day before the Germans reached Paris, Morize escaped with three trunks full of French government documents. He kept about a day ahead of the tide of the German army as he made his way to Lisbon, Portugal, to catch a clipper back to the United States. He successfully escaped Europe and returned to Harvard on October 7, 1940.Harvard Crimson, October 8, 1940. He returned to his professorial duties but remained active in the Harvard and local Boston community, advocating for relief measures for refugees.Harvard Crimson, November 13, 1940; February 28, 1941; March 18, 1941; May 2, 1941; May 20, 1941.

In France, he obtained a divorce from his wife, Ruth, on March 12, 1952.Boston Herald, May 17, 1952. However, his wife took him to court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, seeking compensation because she claimed Morize had abandoned her by traveling to and deciding to stay in France after his retirement. The divorce became a local sensation due to Ruth's socialite status, Morize's local presence, and the legal precedence of whether a Suffolk County court could adjudicate a French divorce.Boston Traveler, May 16, 1952; Boston Herald, May 17, 1952; Boston Traveler, June 16, 1952.

A remake of the 2012 French romantic comedy film Plan de Table, the film stars Sam Claflin, Olivia Munn and Eleanor Tomlinson. It was released on 10 April 2020 by Netflix. Plot While in Rome visiting his sister Hayley, Jack tries to muster up the courage to kiss Dina, an American war correspondent and Hayley's roommate, before returning to London. However, they are interrupted by Greg, Jack's dorm roommate from university, who offers Jack a ride to the airport. After Jack and Dina awkwardly say their goodbyes, a frustrated Jack leaves with Greg. Three years later, Jack is at Hayley's wedding. Bryan, an aspiring actor and the \\"maid of honour\\", is more concerned about impressing Italian film director Vitelli than assisting the bride. Amanda, Jack's \\"nightmare of an ex- girlfriend\\", has come to the wedding with her boyfriend Chaz, with whom she has clear commitment issues. Other guests include clingy Rebecca and socially inept Sidney. Since their parents are dead, Hayley has asked Jack to walk her down the aisle. Just as they are about to, Hayley informs Jack that Dina has come to the wedding and is newly single. After the ceremony, Jack and Dina meet for the first time in three years. The two admit that they used to ask Hayley about one another. Marc, Hayley's former school classmate, arrives uninvited while high on cocaine, confessing his love for Hayley. She demands that Marc leave, before her husband Roberto shows up and invites Marc to stay for the celebrations. Hayley asks Jack to drug Marc with her sleeping drops and he reluctantly agrees. Shortly after Jack places the drops into Marc's empty champagne glass, a group of children playfully rearrange the seating order. The narrator comments on the many variations eight people can sit at a table. Following the rearrangement, the drugged glass ends up with Bryan, who quickly drinks it all. Jack arrives at the table and switches glasses, unaware that Bryan had already ingested the drops. While Jack and Dina reconnect, Marc blackmails Hayley by threatening to tell Roberto they had sex three weeks earlier. Hayley once again asks Jack to handle him, so Jack and Sidney lock Marc in a cupboard. A sedated Bryan mumbles through his maid-of-honour speech, before destroying the cake. After a guest releases Marc from the cupboard, he grabs the microphone and exposes his affair with Hayley in front of all the guests. Upset, Roberto walks out on Hayley, but when she tries to stop him, he accidentally falls over a balcony. The scene freezes as the narrator reminds the audience of how the wedding can be affected by endless seating arrangements. In fast-forward, the film depicts a number of alternate scenarios where different guests are drugged each time, all ending in mayhem. In the last scenario, Jack is finally sat beside Dina, though he is the one that ends up drugged. Unable to regurgitate the sedative, Jack asks Bryan to put his fingers down his throat. Dina walks in on the two, much to Jack's embarrassment. They try to move past it back at the table, but as Dina tearfully opens up about her mother's death, Jack struggles to stay awake, upsetting her. Things soon being to look up for Jack and the other guests. Rebecca confesses that she likes Bryan for himself, not who he pretends to be, and the two hook up. Bryan gives a successful speech that impresses Vitelli. Following a conversation with Jack, Marc decides against exposing the affair. Instead, he wishes Hayley and Roberto the best and leaves. Amanda and Chaz realise they are not right for each other and part amicably. Sidney hits it off with an equally awkward woman, thanks to Jack's advice. As Dina is leaving the wedding due to a work emergency, Jack attempts to connect with her for the last time. She says that although the feelings were mutual, they missed their moment and leaves. After finally landing an opportunity with Vitelli, Bryan inspires Jack to take chances when they come. He takes off and chases after Dina, catching her at the end of the street. Just as he is about to kiss her, they are nearly interrupted by a man passing by who claims to know Dina. Jack tells him to go away and they finally kiss. During the credits, other variations and mishaps are shown.

It is a branch of soil science (pedology) concerned with soils of the distant geologic past and of other planetary bodies to understand our place in the universe. A geologic definition of soil is ‚Äúa material at the surface of a planetary body modified in place by physical, chemical or biological processes‚Äù. Soils are sometimes defined by biological activity but can also be defined as planetary surfaces altered in place by biologic, chemical, or physical processes. By this definition, the question for Martian soils and paleosols becomes, were they alive? Astropedology symposia are a new focus for scientific meetings on soil science. Advancements in understanding the chemical and physical mechanisms of pedogenesis on other planetary bodies in part led the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) in 2017 to update the definition of soil to: \\"The layer(s) of generally loose mineral and/or organic material that are affected by physical, chemical, and/or biological processes at or near the planetary surface and usually hold liquids, gases, and biota and support plants\\". Moon The surface of the moon is covered with lunar regolith, a mixture of fine dust and rocky debris made by meteorite impacts, considered the soil of the moon.prohects.ncsu.edu/project/agronauts/mission3_5.htm Astronauts found few rock samples to pick up on mature regolith surfaces. The rocks had all been broken to fine soil by micrometeorite bombardment over the past billion years. The bulk of lunar regolith is a fine gray soil, breccia and rock fragments of the local bedrock. Continuous attacks by micrometeorites further disintegrate and melt soil particles. This melt, mixed with lithic fragments, forms irregular clusters called agglutinates.curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/letss/regolith.pdf Lunar exploration has found all essential minerals for growth of plants in sufficient quantities. Organic matter in the form of amino acids have been detected in lunar samples from the Apollo missions, but isotopic and molecular evidence of these compounds suggests terrestrial contamination as the source Mars 3.7 billion year old paleosols in Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars, from Curiosity Rover Evidence of paleosols on Mars is derived from both in-situ and orbital remote sensing investigations of the Martian surface. In-situ chemical / mineralogical analyses (Mars Science Laboratory) and images (Mastcam, MAHLI) from the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater on Mars have shown similarities with soil horizons and soil structures found on Earth. Morphological evidence includes soil features such as gradational alteration and bedding disruption by dilational cracks and veins, consistent with soluans of desert soils, blocky angular ped structures, sand wedges, a shallow gypsic (By) horizon, and vesicular structure. Structures like those found in Earth's desert soils caused by microbial gas production after rains (vesicular structure) have been recognized on Mars, but definitive evidence of life on Mars has yet to be obtained. Mineral abundances within the paleosols show olivine weathering to smectite and a modest depletion of phosphorus. Such hydrolytic weathering is comparable to weathering found on Earth. The chemical and morphological features of the Yellowknife Bay paleosols are a new line of evidence for late Noachian (3.7 ¬± 0.3 Ga) paleoclimate on Mars, and are interpreted as forming under a hyperarid frigid paleoclimate. Radiometric dating suggests the paleosols at Yellowknife Bay are 3.7 billion years old (¬± 0.3 billion years) and reveal a change from possible \\"warm and wet\\" conditions of the Early Noachian (~4.1-3.9 Ga) to an extreme arid and cold climate with limited soil formation. Remote sensing of the Martian surface by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)'s CRISM instrument and the Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer (OMEGA) has detected the presence of dioctahedral and trioctahedral phyllosilicate clays in thousands of locations across the surface of the planet.Bishop, J.L. et al., 2008, Phyllosilicate diversity and past aqueous activity revealed at Mawrth Vallis, Mars.

There are two hypotheses to explain the formation and distribution of phyllosilicate clays on Mars: (1) subsurface and hydrothermal activity and/or diagenesis which yield trioctahedral phyllosilicates, and (2) surface / subaerial chemical weathering, e.g., pedogenesisMichalski, J.R., Cuadros, J., Bishop, J.L., Dyar, M.D., Dekov, V., and Fiore, S., 2015, Constraints on the crystal-chemistry of Fe / Mg-rich smectitic clays on Mars and links to global alteration trends: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 427, p. 215‚Äì225, doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2015.06.020.Horgan, B., Baker, L., Carter, J., and Chadwick, O., 2017, Where is the climate signature in the mineral record of early Mars?

Importantly, some of these areas (Mawrth Vallis and Oxia Planum) have weathering profiles of Al- smectites overlain by Fe/ Mg smectites (all of which appear to be dioctahedral), and then poorly crystalline / amorphous phases like allophane and imogolite. These weathering profiles are capped by an igneous deposit of an estimated 3.7-3.6 Ga which may be a pyroclastic deposit or a mafic sandstone, similar to paleosols buried beneath igneous deposits on Earth. These stratigraphic profiles appear to be up to 200 m in thickness, with individual layers of 10 m in thickness or less. This stratigraphy reflects the possible cooling and drying of Noachean Mars, and may preserve organic matter or other biosignatures because of the exceptionally high clay content (~50 wt %) and clay mineralogy (2:1 smectites) of these buried rocks.  Mars-analog paleosols on Earth  Growing Plants on the Moon and Mars The soil on Mars has the required nutrients plants would need to survive. Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, manganese, zinc, copper, molybdenum, boron, and chlorine have all been detected on Martian soil or in Martian meteorites. Depending on the exact location, fertilizers may need to be added to the soil. Lunar and Mars explorations have provided information about the mineral composition of the soils on the Moon and Mars. All essential minerals for the growth of plants appear to be present in sufficient quantities in both soils probably with the exception of reactive nitrogen. Nitrogen in reactive form (NO3, NH4) is one of the essential minerals necessary for almost all plant growth. The major source of reactive nitrogen on Earth is the mineralization of organic matter. Nitrogen in reactive form (NO3, NH4) is one of the essential minerals necessary for almost all plant growth. Reactive nitrogen is part of the material in our solar system and is part of solar wind, a source of reactive nitrogen on the moon and Mars. Reactive nitrogen may also arise as an effect of lightning or volcanic activity and both processes may occur on Mars. This indicates that in principle reactive nitrogen could be present. However, the Mars Pathfinder was not able to detect reactive nitrogen. Thus the actual presence of major quantities of reactive nitrogen remains uncertain. The absence of sufficient reactive nitrogen may be solved by using nitrogen fixing species. In symbioses with bacteria these nitrogen fixers are able to bind nitrogen from the air and transform it into nitrates, a process which requires nitrogen in the atmosphere. However, there is no atmosphere on the moon, and on Mars it is only minimally present and contains traces of nitrogen. There are published reports on the first large-scale controlled experiment to investigate the possibility of growing plants in Mars and moon soil simulants. The results show that plants are able to germinate and grow on both Martian and moon soil simulant for a period of 50 days without any addition of nutrients. Growth and flowering on Mars regolith simulant was much better than on moon regolith simulant and even slightly better than on our control nutrient poor river soil. Reflexed stonecrop (a wild plant); the crops tomato, wheat, and cress; and the green manure species field mustard performed particularly well. The latter three flowered, and cress and field mustard also produced seeds. The results showed that in principle it is possible to grow crops and other plant species in Martian and Lunar soil simulants. However, many questions remain about the simulants‚Äô water carrying capacity and other physical characteristics and also whether the simulants are representative of the real soils. Perchlorates The presence of perchlorates in the soil makes growing vegetables on Mars especially difficult. Since there is no ozone layer on Mars, UV rays penetrate to the surface of the planet. Perchlorates become toxic when exposed to UV light, destroying bacteria within minutes of exposure. Research suggests that the iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide present in the soil on Mars increases the toxicity of perchlorates. The high level of perchlorates found on Mars (0.05 wt %) is concentrated enough that it would be toxic for humans and crops, and could be used for rocket fuel. Studies indicate that low concentrations of aqueous perchlorates inhibit the height, weight, chlorophyll content and oxidizing power of plants. One plant, E. crassipes, seems to have a high tolerance to perchlorates and might be an ideal plant for growing on Mars. Perchlorates can accumulate in the tissue of plants if grown in a contaminated medium. Since even trace amounts interfere with thyroid functions in humans, the presence of perchlorates in Martian soils is a significant issue that needs to be addressed before colonization occurs. Early Earth Reconstructed 3.5 billion year old paleosols from the Panorama Formation in the Pilbara region of Western Australia Soil profiles from the Pilbara region of northwestern Australia show distinct depletion of phosphorus. A common metabolism for sulfur bacteria is oxidation to sulphates such as gypsum and barite. These minerals are common is anaerobic acid- sulphate soils found on Earth currently and are considered a potential reason for the accumulation of sulphate in Archaean paleosols. This reflects circumstantial evidence for life in paleosols on Earth during the Archean, 3.42 to 3.46 Ga [1]. Origin of life Hypothetical evolution of soil types on various meteorite parent bodies and planetary surfaces The theory that life evolved in soil is appealing because soil traps water between the grains of clay, providing an array of microscopic reaction chambers. These may also promote formation of organic compounds by mechanisms demonstrated in the Urey- Miller experiment, so that planetary surfaces were covered with carbonaceous chondrite. Clayey and organic soils are protected from erosion and thus continued to produce clay and organic matter. Unicellular life, when it evolved, would also have served same purpose of binding the soil. The ingredients required for life are still provided by the weathering cycle, which promotes life.

However, it continues to be reintroduced by international travelers, and in recent years, anti-vaccination sentiment has allowed for the reemergence of measles outbreaks. In 2018, 371 cases of measles were confirmed in the United States. From January to August 2019, 1215 cases across 30 states had been confirmed as measles by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is the largest number of cases in one calendar year since the disease was declared eliminated. In 2019, a state of emergency was declared in New York City and Washington in response to the extremely contagious disease. There is concern that the World Health Organization (WHO) may rescind the U.S.'s measles elimination status. The vast majority of people infected had not received vaccination and were living in close-knit communities where the immunization rate is lower than average. The director of the National Institutes of Health wrote in 2016 that parents refusing to vaccinate their children were leading to outbreaks of preventable diseases, including measles. The World Health Organization also reported that the rise in measles is a direct result of anti-vaccination movements. The recommended measles vaccination protocol is to receive two doses, at least one month apart. One dose of the vaccination is 93 percent effective at preventing measles, while two doses is 97 percent effective. Measles is one of the most contagious of infectious diseases. If not immunized, a person exposed to someone with measles has a 95% chance of becoming infected. During the early stage of an outbreak in an unvaccinated population, each infected person spreads the disease to an average of 12 to 18 other people.  History  Before the vaccine was available in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that about three to four million were infected each year, with 400 to 500 people dying and 48,000 being hospitalized as a result. The last major outbreak was before the disease was eliminated, and occurred from 1989 to 1991. During this outbreak, 123 people died, the majority of whom were preschool children. In the United States on average, two or three out of every 1000 children infected will die, and one will develop complications that often result in permanent brain damage. The 2019 outbreak prompted President Donald Trump to shift away from his previous goal of spacing out vaccinations, and to insist that parents must vaccinate their children, stating \\"They have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important\\". The Trump Administration also took a forceful position of requiring vaccination, with Trump's Surgeon General Jerome Adams calling for limitations on exemptions to vaccination.  Local outbreaks  While the years of 2015, and 2017, each had one outbreak, the first involving 147 cases linked to exposure at Disneyland in California, and the second among a largely unvaccinated Somali community in Minnesota, 2018 had 17 reported outbreaks. In 2019, cases were reported in 23 states, and the total number of reported cases (764) reached the highest number in 25 years by April. More than 500 of these cases were people who were not vaccinated against measles, and another 125 had an unknown vaccination status. The bulk of those infected were from the Orthodox Jewish communities in and around New York City. =Washington and Oregon= The areas surrounding Vancouver, Washington, namely in Clark County, experienced an outbreak of measles in late 2018 and early 2019. The area was referred to as an \\"anti-vaccination hotspot\\" and the vaccination rate was 78%, which is too low for herd immunity. Oregon had reported that four residents have contracted measles due to the outbreak in neighboring Clark County. As of April 2019, 74 confirmed cases of measles had been reported to the health department. More than half of those who fell ill were under the age of 10, and 70 of them had not been vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. The remaining three people had received one dose of the measles vaccine. In response to the outbreak, Representative Paul Harris proposed a measure that would remove the ability for parents to refuse any of the required childhood vaccines for philosophical reasons, otherwise keeping medical and religious exemptions. The bill was later amended to limit exemptions for the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) vaccine. Children would not be allowed to attend public or private schools or day-care without evidence of vaccination or approved exemption documents. The bill was passed in April 2019. = New York = New York has experienced outbreaks in New York City and Rockland County in 2018 and 2019. Between October 2018 and April 2019, 423 confirmed cases of measles were reported in New York City. The areas of Williamsburg and Borough Park, two Brooklyn neighborhoods with a high concentration of Orthodox Jews, have been most heavily affected. In response to the outbreak, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency and ordered mandatory vaccinations in the neighborhoods corresponding to the zip codes 11205, 11206, 11211, and 11249. It required that everyone living or working in the neighborhood who is more than six months old receive a vaccination or be subject to a $1,000 fine. Prior to the order, the health commissioner had required schools and day care centers in the area deny service to unvaccinated students to prevent the disease from spreading. In April, city officials ordered the closure of a preschool that refused to cooperate with requests for vaccination information. From October to April, 153 cases of measles were confirmed in Rockland County, New York. Despite 17,000 doses of the MMR vaccination being given, the vaccination rate of children in the area was 72.9 percent as of April. In December 2018, public health officials in Rockland County banned unvaccinated students from attending school. Parents of 42 students at Green Meadow Waldorf School, a private school, sued the Rockland County health department, but a judge denied the request to over turn the order. According to the health department, Green Meadow Waldorf School had a 56% vaccination rate. In March 2019, a flight attendant flew from NYC to Tel Aviv, Israel. Passengers on the flight were informed several days later that the woman had developed measles encephalitis and is in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on a ventilator. The Israeli Ministry of Health reported that the woman may have been exposed in New York or in Israel. In April 2019, a state of emergency was declared in Rockland County, and unvaccinated children were barred from public places for 30 days. Parents of unvaccinated children that did not abide by this condition face up to six months in jail or a $500 fine. A judge later lifted this ban, saying that the outbreak does not qualify for an emergency order. That month, New York began considering legislation to join the seven states and Washington DC that allow children 14 years and older to seek vaccination without parental consent. In June 2019, New York State enacted a law repealing religious and philosophical exemptions for vaccination. The association of the outbreak with the Jewish community led to a rise in instances of antisemitism being expressed in New York. = Michigan = A man from New York traveled to Michigan in March 2019, while unknowingly infected with measles. Health officials reported that he spread the virus to 38 people there. Because he was fundraising for Orthodox Jewish charities, he visited several synagogues each day while there. The man believed that he was immune to measles because he had it as a child. = New Jersey = The CDC declared an outbreak in New Jersey in late 2018. 30 of the 33 confirmed cases were in Ocean County. It was determined that measles was contracted by a person who traveled to Israel and spread the virus upon returning to New Jersey. = California = The CDC tracks the rate of vaccination at kindergartens. While statewide, California has a 97 percent vaccination rate for kindergarteners, some schools, particularly in the Bay Area have vaccination rates below 50%. In 2018, the Santa Cruz Waldorf School in Santa Cruz, CA had a vaccination rate of 33 percent. In 2014, Berkeley Rose School, a Waldorf school in Alameda County, had a vaccination rate of 13 percent. In 2016, CA eliminated \\"philosophical objections\\" as a reason for parents to refuse to vaccinate their children. Following this, the vaccination rate at Berkeley Rose increased to 57 percent. In 2015, a person infected with measles exposed others while visiting Disneyland. This led to the infection of 131 California residents, as well as people in six other states, Canada, and Mexico. Following this outbreak, California changed its vaccination laws to only allow vaccination exemptions for those with medical conditions. From January to April 2019, 21 cases of measles have been reported in CA. The CDC published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report a summary of one outbreak caused by an unvaccinated teenager traveling to England. During the 2019 resurgence that April, two California universities, Cal State Los Angeles and University of California, Los Angeles, have had to quarantine over 300 students and faculty to prevent the spread of measles after persons now known to have measles used public buildings. = American Samoa = On December 8, 2019 American Samoa declared an outbreak of measles, after nine positive cases, four of which are suspected of being locally transmitted. Combating methods With the 2019 outbreak, the CDC stated that it may use its ability to put people on a \\"Do Not Board\\" list for air travel should people known to be carrying measles continue to fly. This list was established in 2007, to combat tuberculosis, but was used to restrict travel of two people during the 2014 measles outbreak. The CDC has, in the past, told some individuals that they believe might have been infected with measles to not use air travel, with those patients voluntarily agreeing to alter travel plans. The CDC states that normally it would be extremely rare to catch measles from an infected passenger due to the overall high rate of vaccinated passengers on average, but the recent anti-vaccination trends threatens to disrupt that model. Social media platforms have made their own efforts to prevent the dissemination of false anti-vaccination claims. As of September 2018, Pinterest had banned users from searching for content about vaccines. In January 2019, Facebook announced that it will be banning posts promoting anti-vaccination propaganda, and the website will no longer be suggesting anti-vaccination pages or groups for users to join. In February 2019, YouTube stated that any user or channel endorsing anti-vaccination content will be demonetized entirely, and not receive any funding for advertisements played before videos. A number of U.S. states tightened vaccine exemptions in the wake of the outbreak, including New York, Washington, and Maine. Vaccination opponents forced a referendum on the issue in Maine, but the new restrictions prevailed with over 70% of voters supporting them.

History The Erie Post began in 1874, changing to the Leamington Post in 1876 under editor William McSween when the first village council took office. A $600 investment by McSween resulted in an eight-column small sheet, which was bought by Charles H. Fox, but reacquired by McSween the next year. Records indicate that McSween was born May 8, 1849, in Scotland, marrying Florence Foster from Mersea Township, who was born in Essex, Ontario, in 1859. A member of the Leamington‚Äôs council during its 1890 recognition as a town, McSween is followed by T. R. Stobbs in 1878. H. Thomson Magill is listed as an editor in 1880, overseeing the paper when a fire destroyed the plant in May 1883. The fire ravaged a large section of the business district, only to have it burn again two years later. Magill‚Äôs editorial from November 18, 1880, details his thoughts on politics, immigration and patriotism. John E. Johnson was born in Wentworth, Ontario, on June 24, 1843. Previous to his time with the paper, Johnson worked at the Cleveland Herald during the American Civil War, and as a teacher and principal of schools in Essex County. He purchased the Leamington Post in 1886, selling a year later and buying the Essex Liberal. Two years later he sold that, and rejoined the Post as proprietor. J. F. McKay and Johnson established the Post Printing Company in 1889, buying out the rival Leamington Tribune and repurchasing the Post from the firm of Wigle and Williams, whom Johnson had sold it to after buying it after Magill‚Äôs death. During the McKay-Johnson partnership, they were also owners of the Comber Herald and publishers of the Kingsville Reporter. After McKay‚Äôs withdrawal, Johnson went it alone until 1898, selling and rebuying the paper with R. E. Marcotte after a year spent leading an expedition to the Yukon. Johnson was also mayor of Leamington for three years and was proprietor of a farm featuring 7,000 peach trees. During this time, Byron Lane had started the Winchester Press in the eponymous town, where he eventually meets future Leamington mayor Philip H. Fader. In 1907, A. A. Whitwam arrived in Leamington, joining the paper and overseeing its acquiring of the Leamington News in 1910 with Johnson. Two years later, Byron Lane sold his stake in the Winchester and returned to Leamington to join the now-titled Post & News, adding Fader to the staff in 1919. Until 1910, the paper would feature a fair amount of tobacco news for the growers in the area, but when the industry began to crash, the H. J. Heinz plant would become a focus for farmers in 1909 and many years to come. Not only Leamington, but the Post & News would also be read by the communities of Albuna, Blytheswood, Ruthven, Inman, Cottam, Pelee Island and Staples. A reader would be hard pressed to find an issue that didn‚Äôt have some bowling columns, a very popular sport in the area. In the early 1920s, the paper had circulation of 2,200 in the town of 3,600. A per annum subscription of $2 would get the reader an eight page, seven column sheet. In 1949, W. A. McKenzie took over as editor until 1954, remaining with the paper as a publisher until 1966 when Thomson Newspapers Ltd bought it. In 1952 Peter Alfred Drake became a general manager and a publisher in 1955, working with editor Tony Duncan until retiring in 1974. Drake was born in England in 1906, moving to Leamington in 1925 and joining the paper‚Äôs staff in 1927/28. He became advertising manager in 1937, having worked as a compositor, linotype operator and pressman. Drake was a Lions Club member, president of the Chamber of Commerce, and is credited with being the original Tomato Festival developer. Tony Duncan joined the paper in 1954 as an editor, taking over for Drake as his 46 years with the paper ended in January 1974. The Post would publish from a new location starting in 1971 on the corner of Princess Street and Mill Street East. Tony Duncan would publish the paper until the mid-1990s with Mike Thibodeau, who had been a news editor with the paper from 1977, until Don Gage became publisher in 1995, with Thibodeau remaining as editor. The Leamington Post would continue printing until 2012, when it ceased operation after 138 years in publication.

Following a violent altercation at a gas station in Montego Bay, Jamaican police and military forces detained Rastafarians throughout Jamaica, killing and torturing many. Exact numbers are not available, but estimates place the number of detained individuals \\"as high as 150\\". In April 2017, following a legal investigation, the government of Jamaica issued an official apology condemning the government's actions in the incident, and established a trust fund for survivors as reparations. Background = The Rastafarian community in Jamaica in the late 1950s = The years prior to the Coral Gardens incident saw the building of tensions between the Rastafarian community and the British colonial government in Jamaica. In 1958, British police engaged in several arrests and evictions of Rastafarians, often bringing to bear charges for the possession of cannabis, which is used as a Rastafarian religious sacrament. Several of these incidences resulted in police killings of Rastafarians, and some of those arrested were reportedly never seen again. Due to alleged violence on the part of the Rastafarians and public discourse which emphasized \\"anti-social\\" aspects of the Rastafarian faith, public opinion in Jamaica largely sided with the police against the Rastafarians. In 1959, a confrontation between a Rastafari security guard and a policeman at Coronation Market resulted in the police beating the security guard, which prompted a violent response from nearby shop owners. The police brought reinforcements, arresting 57 Rastafarians and brutally beating and forcibly shaving the dreadlocks off of some of them. A police car and fire truck were also set on fire during this incident. Later that year, Rastafari leader Reverend Claudius Henry was accused of plotting a revolution and communicating with Fidel Castro. In 1960, Henry's son Reynold was arrested on the grounds of plotting a revolt, and following a declaration of a state of emergency Reynold Henry and his co-conspirators were executed. Following these events, the government began to arbitrarily arrest members of the Rastafari community, under the justification that Rastafarians were involved in orchestrating a communist revolution. In 1962, Jamaica would win its independence, but anti-Rastafarian sentiment continued to be prevalent in the government and police forces, which increasingly viewed the Rastafarians as a security threat. In police training schools, officers would often train using images of Rastafarians as target practice. This sentiment was echoed in general society as well, with Rastafarians often being beaten by civilians, forcing Rastafarians to avoid public spaces. =The Coral Gardens property and Rudolph Franklyn= Coral Gardens was part of a larger property, the Rose Hall estate (which includes the Rose Hall mansion). This property was the site of both small-scale farming by Rastafarians, as well as the ambitions of landlords and government officials who hoped to convert the area into a tourist destination. The government and landlords saw the Rastafarians as an obstacle to their goal of re-purposing the property for tourism, and frequently sent police to evict the Rastafarians.Campbell, Horace G. Coral Gardens 1963: The Rastafari and Jamaican Independence,Social and Economic Studies; Mona Vol. 63, Iss. 1, (2014): 197-214,234. In one such incident in 1961, police attacked Rudolph Franklyn, shooting him six times in the stomach and leaving him for dead. Franklyn received plastic surgery in a hospital to repair his stomach, but was reportedly told by a doctor that once the plastic \\"rotted\\", his wounds would reopen and he would die. Following his surgery, Franklyn was immediately arrested on the grounds of cannabis possession and sentenced to six months in prison. After his release from prison, Franklyn reportedly swore to take revenge against the overseer who had attempted to evict him, Edward Fowler.  The incident  = The gas station = Accounts differ as to the specifics of what happened on April 11. According to police reports, a group of Rastafarians armed with spears, hatchets, and machetes set fire to a gas station as part of an attempted robbery. A skirmish resulted between the Rastafarians and the police who arrived at the gas station, resulting in the deaths of three Rastafarians, two policemen, and three civilians also on the scene. A separate account, published in Public Opinion and supported by relatives of Rudolph Franklyn, as well as Syracuse professor Horace Campbell, asserts that the violence at the gas station was the result of previous conflicts between Franklyn and other Rastafarians in the area on one hand, and the police and property owners on the other. = Further repression = Following the skirmish at the gas station, a police manhunt tracked down and killed the other Rastafarians that had been present at the skirmish. Jamaican newspapers such as The Daily Gleaner published many articles demonizing the Rastafarians and demanding armed intervention by the state. Media also originally described the events at Coral Gardens as an \\"uprising\\", and were later forced to retract their characterization of the event by the Labour Party-led government. On 12 April, Good Friday, Prime Minister Alexander Bustamante gave an order to \\"Bring in all Rastas, dead or alive\\". Police and military forces entered working class neighborhoods and Rastafari encampments to detain Rastafarians, and forcibly cut the dreadlocks of those who were detained. Many Rastafarians were tortured and killed, and the exact tally is unknown.Hippolyte, Erin. \\"Bad Friday: Rastafari After Coral Gardens dir. by Deborah A. Thomas, John L. Jackson Jr. (review).\\" African Studies Review, vol. 58 no. 1, 2015, pp. 279-281. Project MUSE, One estimate suggests that \\"as many as 150\\" individuals were detained over the following day. Legacy Following the events of April 11-13, two narratives of the incident emerged. One view held that the events of the Good Friday weekend constituted an unlawful uprising by the Rastafarians; this view was supported by contemporary media reports of the events and the statements of government officials at the time. Meanwhile, the Rastafarian community in Jamaica held that the actions of Rudolph Franklyn and his compatriots were a justified reaction to decades of persecution by the government and perceived the mass arrests that followed as an abuse of state powers, a view that has been reflected by more recent academic scholarship. The event has been commemorated yearly by the Rastafarian community in Jamaica. In 2011, a documentary film about the incident was released, titled Bad Friday: Rastafari After Coral Gardens. = Government investigation and recognition = In 2015, Public Defender Arlene Harrison Henry submitted a report to the Parliament of Jamaica detailing an investigation of the Coral Gardens incident, and recommending that the government provide financial reparations for the injuries, abuses and deaths caused by its actions against the Rastafarian community. In April 2017, the government of Jamaica issued a formal apology for the incident, taking responsibility \\"without equivocation\\" and stating that the incident \\"should never have happened\\". The government has established a trust fund of J$10 million (~$78,000 USD) for survivors as reparations for the incident. The government also promised to recognize Pinnacle, Saint Catherine Parish, a site with historical relevance to the Rastafarian community, as a protected site under the Jamaica National Heritage Trust.

It is located in the north of Harbin city, on the north bank of the Songhua River, 5 kilometers from the city center. The area of Songpu is , and the population is about 35,000.  Etymology  The meaning of Songpu is the wharf of Songhua River.  Geography  Songpu is located on the north bank of the Songhua River. At the east and south the north is Limin of Hulan, while in the west is Qianjin and Binzhou Railway.  Transport  The subdistrict has four train stations on the Binbei Railway: New Songpu Station (), Miaotaizi Station (), North Songpu Station (), and Songbei Station (). Major motorways which run through Songpu Subdistrict include National Highway 202, the Harbin- Heihe Expressway, and the Harbin-Daqing Expressway.  History  In 1850, it was named Majiachuankou (, literally the wharf of Ma clan) when the wharf was owned by the Ma family. It became a small town, so on December 15, 1912, the governor of Heilongjiang Province ordered that the city council meet at Majiachuankou () which belonged to Hulan County. The next year, it changed its name to Songbei city council (). In 1925, it changed its name to Songpu city council (), and became part of Harbin special city in 1933. It became Songpu District in 1938. In 1953, Songpu District had two townships, Songpu () and Xinxing (), and two subdistricts, Tangchang () and Chuankou (). In 1958, Songpu District was momentarily merged into Binjiang District, but Binjiang District was cancelled. Songpu township was then place in Daowai District. Songpu became a people's commune. In 1979, Daowai restored all the subdistricts, and set more two subdistricts: Zhenjiang () and Chuankou (). In 1983, Songpu again became a township. In 1985, Songpu became a town, and Chuankou Subdistrict was merged into Songpu Town. In 2004, Songpu belonged to Songbei District. In November, the Harbin government approved Songpu as a subdistrict. In 2017, became split off from Songpu. Chuankou took two residential communities, Chuankou () and Guangxin Xincheng (), and three villages, Taiyangsheng (), Dongming (), and Dengta () from Songpu.  Administrative divisions  Songpu Subdistrict administers 5 residential communities and 6 administrative villages. The subdistrict's residential communities are Tangchang (), Changshengyuan (), Bei'anqicheng (), Beianxinghecheng (), and Fulicheng ().

Cruz currently creates art in Long Island after living and moving from New York.  Biography  On September 2, 1942, Pura Cruz was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico and later moved and grew up in East Harlem, New York. Cruz owes most of her artwork and inspiration to her life in New York, claiming that living in New York gave her ‚Äústreet smarts‚Äù and ‚Äúindependence‚Äù and allowed her art to convey social and political views. Although born in Puerto Rico and considered a Latin American feminist artist, growing up in New York gave her her roots and played a huge part in her childhood and who she is, even creating several collections and art pieces about her life in New York. Unlike other young girls she grew up with, Cruz was more of a tomboy and read comics and superhero stories growing up. Wonder Woman played a large part in her childhood and helped find her femininity and strength in being a woman. Unlike most woman in her era who were submissive and catered to male needs, Wonder Woman provided Cruz with a sense of empowerment and individuality which inspired a lot of her work, even describing Wonder Woman as her role model. She rediscovered her admiration for Wonder Woman in her painting series entitled ‚ÄúLost and Found.‚Äù In a culture where women were obligated to fit the needs of men, this superhero gave her the power to stand up for herself and started her career as an artist. Helen Harrison describes the basis of Pura Cruz's art as \\"the struggle to preserve Hispanic traditions in the face of misunderstandings and hostility\\". Cruz also owes her inspiration to family folklore and \\"domestic magic\\". Cruz describes her art process as sporadic, spontaneous, and pure, starting from just playing with art supplies. Her art usually does not start with a formula or set idea, but is executed through trial and error and usually involved political statements or a combination of her life in New York and upbringings in Puerto Rico. Cruz is currently still alive at 77 years old and moved to Long Island in 1970 in interest of raising her three daughters there. One of her most famous pieces is a series of painting and sculptures entitled ‚ÄúBroken Guitars‚Äù as a memoir to her father‚Äôs death.  Education  BA Degree in Studio Art, Liberal Arts and Sciences/Liberal Studies, Dean's List /Top 10% from Stony Brook University Suffolk County Community College, Selden New York Parsons School of Design, New York, New York Activities and Societies: Co- curated art exhibitions for ten years with Marcia Weiner, Student Union Gallery Director/Stony Brook University  Artworks  2006 Native New Yorker: This is a painting representing Cruz‚Äôs development from childhood to adulthood in East Harlem and Manhattan. There are two pairs of lips growing from small to big and her face transforms into a New York skyline. 2010 Vertigo Series: This series was inspired by Neil Armstrong who had vertigo but still became the first man on the moon, showing how one could overcome their disabilities. Adam--1999 Series: 1990 Adam Gives Birth: Cruz's Adam--1999 series includes different artworks depicting birth, and the male body. This particular painting shows a pregnant female with two heads; one looking at the viewer and one playing a musical instrument. This artwork has religious backgrounds as Adam is in a pieta position, suggesting how science crosses lines when topics on men giving birth are involved. 2015 Marcelo Lucero painting: Cruz honored a painting for Lucero after he was stabbed to death by teenagers in 2008 as a result of a hate crime. This painting was to honor Lucero and to bring awareness to anti-Latino hate crimes in Long Island. A Guitar Grows on Long Island: This was a painting done as a tribute to Marcelo Lucero including a thick black ribbon, a cross, and the guitar resembling a tree branching out.

History Masthead of May 12, 1883 issue of the Marine Review The Marine Record‚Äôs earliest known proprietor was Frank Houghton, when the paper was publishing out of 171 Superior (Leader Building) and 136 Bank Streets of Cleveland, Ohio in 1883. He last appears in the March 8th, 1883 issue, prior to the Marine‚Äôs offices being demolished and moved to 2 South Water Street in April of the same year. Soon after Alanson Wilcox appears as editor and proprietor until August 2nd, until the Marine Printing Company is credited as publisher for the rest of the summer. That fall, Albert A. Pomeroy has the position of editor and proprietor until the early 1890s, when Irving B. Smith and Capt. John Swainson are identified as publishers. During Pomeroy‚Äôs tenure, the offices moved back to the Leader Building in 1884, and five years later to 181 Detroit Street. The paper‚Äôs coverage was primarily the Great Lakes region and dealt with shipping, shipbuilding matters, and items of import to the merchant marine. The front page featured illustrations of ship structures or reproductions of maritime themed art. Advertising was of products and services that would be of use to the able seaman, such as ship parts, builders, and hauling contracts. The Marine Record had been publishing in various incarnations since 1878, and in 1902 The Marine Review was established, a publication similar in scope and name. Both papers had praise for a third publication, Marine Engineering, which would eventually absorb the two papers. Marine Engineering started in New York City, 1902, by the Marine Publishing Company out of the World Building. H. M. Swetland was listed as president and general manager, with H. F. Donaldson as editor. During this same period, the Record was acquiring the Review. In November 1935 the Review was published by Penton Publishing Company until acquired by the parent publishing company of Engineering, Simmons-Boardman Publishing.

She completed studies at the Boucicault School of Acting in 1889.  Career  Madison started her stage career as an actress in touring companies, and appeared with English actor Richard Mansfield in Richard III. By 1893, she was described primarily as a dancer, specializing in performance of the \\"crinoline dance\\" or skirt dance, a popular trend of the day.Nancy A. Hewitt, \\"Varieties of Voluntarism: Class, Ethnicity, and Women's Activism in Tampa\\" in Louise A. Tilly and Patricia Gurin, eds., Women, Politics and Change (Russell Sage Foundation 1990): 75. In 1900 she danced with Loie Fuller in Paris, at the Exposition Universelle. While in Paris, she also danced in a cage of lions as a publicity stunt. In 1910, she danced at the opening of the Colonial Opera House in Hamilton, Bermuda. Inspired by Fuller, Madison took a particular interest in lighting effects and innovative costuming for her performances. She amazed audiences when flags and famous portraits were projected onto her skirts while they whirled and fluttered. \\"Miss Madison is the originator or many novel effects in ballroom exhibition dances,\\" explained the San Francisco Chronicle in 1916. Madison toured the United States that year, with poet Charles Keeler, interpreting his poems in dances such as \\"The Harper's Song of Isis\\" (an Egyptian art-inspired dance), \\"The Vampire\\" (a bat-themed dance) and \\"Princess Papilio\\" (a butterfly-themed dance). She also taught social dance steps in New York City.  Personal life  Madison had a daughter, Beatrice Maude, who became an actress. Madison died in 1953, at home in Hollywood, California.

He was known for his ability to introduce nuances of color and emphasis in bare and simple pictorial themes. Difficult to label, his work was seen as paradoxical: \\"elegant and anguished, somber and yet playful, rigorous yet free.\\" Throughout his career, he faced challenges that were beyond his control and seemed, as one observer said, to be \\"an artist who by birth, temperament and timing started out carrying a heavy load.\\" Nonetheless, he also seemed to be his own worst enemy, disregarding the necessity of earning a living and alienating those who tried to help him. Early life and education Carroll Sockwell was born on February 13, 1943, in Washington, D.C. and grew up in a household headed by his maternal grandmother. His mother worked as a maid and his father worked sometimes as a laborer and sometimes served in the armed forces. The grandmother was also a maid. As well as these relatives, he shared the house with an aunt and uncle and four brothers. With his father infrequently present, his mother had charge of his upbringing until, in 1948, she began a 15-year period of hospitalization for schizophrenia. On her departure, his aunt became his caregiver. Sockwell attended public schools in the District and, while still a pupil, was himself committed to the same psychiatric hospital as the one where his mother was a patient. Through contact with social workers he became interested first in music, then to theater, and finally to painting as possible careers. In 1957, at the age of 14 he entered the Corcoran School of Art as a student and, the following year, won a prize for a work he created there. During the time he was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment he met Elinor Ulman, a \\"passionate and ambitious\\" believer in the therapeutic value of making art. She became a mentor, introducing him to the principal Washington, D.C. art galleries and museums and encouraging his artistic ambitions. In 1959, at the age of 17, Sockwell left his family home. He moved to Manhattan where he found work at Bonwit Teller and, by visiting bars that they frequented, began to meet abstract expressionist artists such as Barnett Newman and Willem de Kooning. Failing to find a foothold in the New York art scene, he returned to Washington D.C. in 1963. Of that four-year period he later said \\"I was almost the only black. It was hard to be accepted.\\" Back in Washington he lived hand to mouth for a time. In 1965 he began a three-year stint as curator in the city's non-profit African-American gallery, Barnett- Aden. In 1968 or soon after, Sockwell became acquainted with Walter Hopps, James Harithas, and Harry Lunn, each of whom began to influence, support, and sustain his work. Hopps was then director of the Washington Gallery of Modern Art which, in 1968, was absorbed by the Corcoran Gallery. Harithas was then director of that gallery and Harry Lunn had just opened a commercial gallery in Washington. Career in art In 1958, then aged 15, Sockwell was awarded a prize for his painting, \\"Bridge With the Sun.\\" In 1966 he exhibited in a group show held at the Tarot Gallery in Manhattan. Two years later his work appeared beside works by Michael Clark, Robert Newman, and Kenneth Wade in an exhibition of hard-edge art at the Corcoran Gallery He showed the following year in an NAACP-sponsored group exhibition held at the Nordness Gallery in Manhattan. Other exhibitors included Norman Lewis, Charles McGee, Felrath Hines, Alma W. Thomas, Walter Williams. At the same time his work appeared in a group of seventeen artists at the Ringling Museum in Sarasota and at about this time he showed at the Margaret Dickey Gallery in the District. In 1971 a solo exhibition at the Jefferson Place Gallery called \\"Mirror Compositions\\" drew favorable criticism in both the Washington Post and Jet magazine. Another solo, this at the Corcoran, followed in 1974 and in the same year his work appeared in group shows at the Whitney and Brooklyn Museums. That year he also executed a commission for a 40-foot-long mural for the psychiatric ward of D.C. General Hospital. He subsequently showed in Washington commercial spaces, including the Middendorf, Fraser, and Fiedler galleries. Sockwell continued to show during the rest of the 1980s and first two years of the 1990s, but toward the end of this time he suffered periods when despite the assurance of high- priced sales he was unable to work and in the months leading up to his death in July 1992 he squandered the comfortable living that had been provided for him and returned to the destitute state of his early years as an artist. On July 9, 1992, Sockwell committed suicide by jumping off the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge in Washington's Foggy Bottom. Writing just before that event, a Washington critic wrote that despite Sockwell's reputation for being somewhat difficult--\\"\\"rather excessively endowed with what is known as 'artistic temperament'\\"--his work was widely shown and enthusiastically received by both gallery goers and collectors. Afterwards Washington Post writer, Gene Weingarten, wrote a lengthy appreciation of his work and explication of his complex temperament and background. On June 4, 1992, a solo exhibition of Sockwell's work opened at the Washington Project for the Arts. One critic said it was \\"one of its worthiest and most compelling shows.\\" Another said that although \\"everyone praises his art,\\" many people in the local art scene were exasperated with Sockwell. He drank too much, alienated the owners of commercial galleries that showed him, refused to promote his work, would not meet with collectors who were interested in buying, and seemed constitutionally unable to hold down a job. One acquaintance told this critic, that Sockwell refused to engage in the business side of art, saying \\"Carroll thinks being an artist is enough.\\" Another said he did not paint as a career, but because he had to, \\"like a raw nerve.\\" In the years following Sockwell's death his work sporadically appeared in commercial galleries and museum exhibitions. Among the most significant of these was a retrospective in February 1999 at Case Western Reserve University's Mather Gallery curated by Sockwell friend and mentor James Hilleary.Plain Dealer: \\"Artist's abstract drawings possess power\\" by Steven Litt (Feb 1999) Style and influences Carroll Sockwell, Untitled, about 1965, gouache on paper, 11 x 8 inches Carroll Sockwell, Untitled, 1973, watercolor and acrylic on paper, 21 1/2 x 29 1/2 inches Carroll Sockwell, Untitled, 1988, India ink and colored pencil on paper, 30 x 36 inches Carroll Sockwell, Legend 3, 1989, mixed media on paper, 32 x 40 inches Sockwell's work was nonrepresentational, integrating both geometric and gestural abstraction. Critics saw paradoxes in it, perceiving elements both rigorous and free. One said he achieved an equipoise between the \\"feral\\" and the \\"tame.\\" A colleague said his \\"greatest strength lies in his ability to hold polar opposites and contradictions in his mind and resolve them visually in his art.\\" Most critics saw in Sockwell's work the influence of his troubled life. They found his style difficult to label. One critic saw in it a unique \\"synthesis of classical modernism and minimalism.\\" An acquaintance, when asked to pick a phrase to describe Sockwell's art, came up with \\"classicism in despair.\\" Sockwell worked mostly on paper. He used graphite, charcoal, pastel, watercolor, gouache, and acrylic. Grays, blacks, and whites dominate much of his work. Most of his output was two-dimensional, but he also made mixed-media wall constructions. He made a few large works and many small ones. The untitled work of about 1965, shown upper left, is an example of Sockwell's handling of gouache in grays and blacks on paper. The untitled work of 1973, shown upper right, is an example of his handling of watercolor and acrylic in multiple colors on paper. The untitled work of 1988, shown lower left, is an example of Sockwell's handling of India ink with subtle use of colored pencil on paper. The work called \\"Legend 3,\\" shown lower right, is an example of Sockwell's handling of mixed media on paper. Reviewing the exhibition that opened just before Sockwell's death, Washington Post critic, Michael Welzenbach, summarized his art as \\"the invention of beauty and movement for their own sakes, a series of interconnected riffs revolving around a steady chord progression, and a tempo that seems never to falter.\\" Personal life and family The Sockwell family lived in a house on Virginia Avenue at a location in Foggy Bottom where the Watergate Hotel now stands. It consisted of Sockwell's maternal grandmother, Sarah Wilson, along with an aunt, Edna Johnson, and her husband, Lonnie Johnson. Sockwell's parents were Luther and Annie Sockwell, and his siblings, all of them older brothers, were Edward (twelve years his senior), Paul (eight years), Luther (six years), and Eugene (five years). His mother was born in South Carolina in about 1912; his father in North Carolina in about 1903. A few years before his birth, the household's women earned their livings as domestic servants in private homes. Lonnie was then a dishwasher in a restaurant and Luther a laborer in a cemetery. Sockwell's father was an alcoholic and reportedly had two other families. His mother suffered a schizophrenic breakdown in 1948 and spent 15 years in St. Elizabeths Hospital. Sockwell's aunt, Edna Johnson, took care of him and his brothers with reluctance. One of them told a reporter that she drove them out of the house, one by one. At various times Sockwell was a patient at St. Elizabeths and in the psychiatric ward of D.C. General Hospital. He was both gay and African-American. He did not leave a suicide note and did not indicate to anyone that he was thinking about ending his life.  Notes  References 1943 births 1992 deaths Artists from Washington, D.C.

History KJKJ was started by Joseph E. Patrick and Joseph A. Brandt of Dateline Broadcasters. The two men worked at KRUX in Phoenix. The station signed on November 2, 1962, broadcasting with 250 watts. During its short life on air, KJKJ made national news on one occasion. In May 1963, Jack Hughes and Robert Polk began a marathon broadcast that would turn out to be 93 hours and 35 minutes long, setting a then-National Association of Broadcasters record. KJKJ's signing on gave Flagstaff an unprecedented five operating radio stations. In mid-1963, KFGT at 930 AM, which had come to air on October 15, 1962, was sold; it would be silent for months until returning as KAFF (AM) that fall. In August 1963, the original KVNA at 690 kHz folded, which with KAFF returning to the air brought the count down to four. However, the station would soon fall into a mire of ownership and financial troubles. In late March 1964, KJKJ was sold to Charles and Rosemary Foster for $44,500 in a transaction that would never be consummated. The next month, Coconino County filed a federal tax lien of $2,150 against Dateline for withholding tax and other taxes. The station went off the air late in 1964; on January 4, 1965‚Äîwith Dateline having fallen behind on rent to The Arizona Bank, from which it leased studio space‚Äîthe bank proceeded to hold a public auction for studio and office equipment. In September 1965, the Coconino County Superior Court appointed a receiver, Lloyd Young, in order to resolve an ownership dispute between Dateline and the Fosters; Young quickly filed the station's license renewal. On August 9, 1966, Young filed to sell KJKJ out of bankruptcy to Radio Albuquerque, Inc. for $24,000, but the sale never materialized, and the station would not return to air.

Public life Hutton in the Forest, seat of the Fletcher-Vane baronets Sir Frederick was made High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1788, and changed his surname from Vane- Fletcher to Fletcher-Vane in 1790. Around this time George Romney was commissioned to take his portrait. At the age of 31, he entered Parliament in the pocket borough of Winchelsea when his kinsman, Viscount Barnard, entered the House of Lords on becoming the 3rd Earl of Darlington in 1792, later first Duke of Cleveland. Winchelsea was considered one of the notorious rotten boroughs of England, abolished by the Great Reform Act of 1832 but at the time under the control of the Earls of Darlington.

Lord Inglewood, the current incumbent of Hutton in the Forest, stated at a 2014 John Cornforth lecture that Sir Frederick contemplated the sale of Hutton.Transcript of The John Cornforth Lecture by Lord Inglewood on Wednesday 15 January 2014, p.21 It is clear that Sir Frederick and his young family largely based themselves at Armathwaite.https://www.cumbriacountyhistory.org.uk/sites/default/files/John%20Cornforth%20Lecture%202014.pdf Armathwaite Hall Sir Francis Fletcher Vane, 5th Baronet, describes Armathwaite in his memoirs:Agin the Governments, page 187 > There on the lake is Armathwaite Hall, the favourite house of my > grandfather, where my father spent his early life, and Scarness also on the > lake-a favourite of my people [the 4th Baronet also enjoyed Armathwaite and > his widow, Lady Margaret, died at Scarness Cottage]. After his move to Armathwaite, in 1796 Sir Frederick was elected MP for Carlisle, replacing Wilson Gale-Braddyll as the partner of John Christian Curwen in the anti-Lowther interest. The anti-Lowther faction in the North West of England concerned the control of the parliamentary dual member borough of Carlisle that was contested by three old Cumberland families: the Howards, Earls of Carlisle, the Musgraves and the Lowthers.The History of Parliament: Carlisle, Double Member Borough. The History of Parliament Trust, 1964-2016 In the north west of England, the Lowther family also controlled the pocket borough of Cockermouth, like Winchelsea a rotten borough abolished by the Great Reform Act of 1832, together with the double member borough of Westmorland. By 1761, the Howard's control of Carlisle was weakening and Sir James Lowther took the opportunity to take control of the borough. The freemen of the city of Carlisle were upset by this and agreed to fund any candidate prepared to challenge the Lowther's position. On election day, a Lowther candidates, John Stanwix, decided to withdraw from the election and the electorate of Carlisle chose Curwen, an independent, together with a Lowther candidate, Raby Vane. In 1796, Sir Frederick was elected to Brooks's on the proposal of Charles James Fox and voted with the Whigs on four occasions before the end of Parliament that year. He joined the Whig Club on 11 April 1797, whose future members included Lord Byron. Bobus Smith was the inspiration behind the Whig Club and would later be a trustee on the resettlement of the Fletcher-Vane estates ahead of the marriage of Sir Francis Fletcher-Vane, 3rd Baronet, to Diana Beauclerk. In 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth made use of Sir Frederick's library at Hutton. Peterloo, a matter on which Sir Frederick wrote to Henry Brougham Sir Frederick's anti-Lowther sentiment took a more violent turn in 1798 when he challenged Lord Lonsdale to a duel.The Times, January 31, 1798, p.3 The duel took place in Hyde Park and, without an outcome, again in Bayswater. The quarrel was eventually called off by a magistrate. Sir Frederick regained the seat of Winchelsea in 1806 but retired in 1807 when the seat was taken by Sir Oswald Mosley. In the General Election of 1818, Sir Frederick failed in his attempt to win the pocket seat of Cockermouth as part of the 'anti-Lowther movement' spearheaded by Henry Brougham. In one of his last political acts, Sir Frederick signed the requisition of a county meeting in Cumberland in October 1819 to consider the Peterloo Massacre having written to Henry Brougham on the 30th of September: > I made this addition opposite my name, ‚Äòand also to consider of the > necessity of a reform in Parliament‚Äô. If that question is not brought > forward, it might appear that a change of ministers was our only object, but > I suppose most of us will be of opinion that no change can be of much use > without a reform in the borough system. Family life It is not known when Sir Frederick began an affair with Hannah Bowerbank, a ‚Äòcompanion‚Äô to Sir Frederick's mother at Hutton in the Forest, according to the memoir of Sir Frederick's grandson, later Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher Vane, 5th Baronet. On 22 August 1794, Hannah Bowerbank gave birth to a daughter, also named Hannah. A son was born on 9 July 1795, Walter Vane, and the ‚Äòintimacy between Sir Frederick and Hannah continued and they lived together at various places in Cumberland and among others at Broughton Hall in the parish of Bridekirk‚Äô.The Times Wednesday, Nov. 15, 1876; p.10; Issue 28787; col E The children were baptised on 16 July 1795 at St Mary's Parish Church, Marylebone, London.Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812 Napoleon on HMS Bellerophon, accompanied to exile on Saint Helena by Lieutenant John Bowerbank Sortie from Bayonne Memorial to the First Foot Guards at the former Anglican Church in Biarritz Memorial to Capt.

It is not clear that they were in fact impoverished.

The Bowerbank family had been settled at Johnby in the parish of Greystoke, County Cumberland, for several centuries and had intermarried with some of the leading Cumberland families of the time including the houses of Fetherstonhaugh and Musgrave.\\"The name of Burbanke was prevalent in Penrith in the 16th century, as a reference to the printed register of that parish will show. Bishop Nicolson has recorded a memorial inscription in Greystoke Church, dated 1520, to Thomas Bourbank, Archdeacon of Carlisle (Miscellany Accounts, pp. 131-2). Another Thomas Burbank was a native of the neighbouring- parish of Dacre and founder of the school of Blencow in 1577 (Jefferson's Leath Ward, p. 196). Under the guise of Bowerbank the name is traceable in that district, intermarrying with the Fetherstonhaughs and Fletcher-Vanes (Ibid, pp. 292, 431, 452).\\" \\"Transactions of the Cumberland & Westmorland Antiquarian & Archaeological Society\\" PART I, VOLUME XV.

Dent served with Nelson on HMS Boreas. Another kinsman, John Bowerbank, a Lieutenant on HMS Bellerephon, accompanied Napoleon to exile on St Helena and he wrote an extant account of his observations during the voyage.Napoleon and His Fellow Travellers, by Clement Shorter, Appendix II. Published by Cassell And Company Limited, London, Paris, New York, Toronto and Melbourne, 1908 The Bowerbank family were also notable in the church and academia, James Scott Bowerbank FRS being another kinsman. On 9 March 1797, Sir Frederick married Hannah Bowerbank at the church of St George the Martyr, Holborn, London. At this point Hannah was pregnant with a third child, Francis Fletcher Vane, who was born on 29 March 1797; the precise date of the birth would be a future bone of contention, resulting in an unedifying lawsuit initiated by Sir Frederick's youngest son in 1872.The Times, Wednesday, 15 November 1876, p.10The Times, Monday, Nov 27, 1876; pg. 9; Issue 28797; col E After Francis's birth, it appears that for the next four years Sir Frederick and Lady Vane resided at Putney, then in Surrey, and ‚Äòat other places in or about London‚Äô. Sir Frederick's first son, Walter Vane, was educated at Eton from 1805 to 1807 and thereafter at Charterhouse between 1808 and 1809 when the school was based at Smithfield, London.The Eton School Lists from 1791 to 1877 by Dr H.E.C.

He fought between March 1813 and April 1814 at the battles of Bidassoa, Nivelle, Nive and Adour.https://www.napoleon- series.org/research/biographies/GreatBritain/Challis/Images751-800/790.pdf Walter Vane attained the rank of Captain on 15 March 1814. At the time of Napoleon's capitulation in 1814, shortly before Napoleon's first exile to Elba, Walter Vane was in the camp of the Grenadier Guards at Bayonne. The French General refused to believe that Napoleon could have conceded and the result is best summed up by Walter's nephew: > The British learnt from their ships that Peace had been signed and sent word > to the French General at Bayonne that this was so but the latter would not > believe it, thinking it a ruse, perfide Albion and all that. But we, knowing > the fact, relaxed in military precautions, and I expect had a jollification. > Then the French made an effective sortie from the town to the west towards > the sea and caught us napping ‚Äì result, many hundreds of our men killed and > thirteen officers. I do not suppose there was any treachery in it, but > rather the incredulity of the French. During the French sortie at Bayonne, Walter suffered wounds on 14 April 1814 and died shortly thereafter on 20 April 1814.Memorial Tablet for Walter Vane, St Bega‚Äôs Church, Bassenthwaite He was nineteen years of age and was buried in one of the Guards‚Äô Cemeteries, North West of Bayonne.The Guards' Cemeteries, St. Etienne, Bayonne, with a Concise Narrative of the Campaign in S.W.France, Previous to and Including the Sortie from Bayonne, April 14th, 1814.

The Times describes him as the second son of Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane when he was in fact the third He was initially sent to Laleham School, then under the control of Dr Arnold who would later develop the Victorian public school ideal of muscular Christianity while headmaster of Rugby.Agin the Governments, p.8 After prep school, Frederick was sent to Eton, under Dr. Keate, where he was a contemporary of the young Gladstone. Keate was known as the ‚Äòswishing headmaster‚Äô and Frederick was ‚Äòone of seventy victims‚Äô punished for breaking bounds to attend the Windsor Fair. The boys were caned alphabetically and Frederick was thankful that by the time his turn came, the headmaster was losing strength. In his memoirs, Frederick's son, Francis, describes a scene at Armathwaite when his father, then a boy at Eton: > witnessed a battle which must have been one of the last feudal ones in > England. My grandfather owned most of the feudal lands round the lake, but > Lord Egremont, who lived at Cockermouth Castle, had some special rights over > the water and the foreshore, and desired to build a pier for some purpose or > other. This was opposed to my grandfather‚Äôs wishes as the park of > Armathwaire runs down to the lake. In spite of this, Egremont sent a body of > workmen from Cockermouth to erect it-and when this was known there was a > call to arms of all our tenants and foresters. So rapidly did they mobilise > that some of them had not time to put on their boots, but rode to the fray > in their stockinged feet. The townsmen were badly beaten by the dalesmen, > some thrown into the lake-and the pier was never built. After Eton, Frederick was commissioned into the 12th Lancers serving with the expeditionary force sent to Portugal in 1827 after which he retired from the Army. He then served in the Consular Service at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and at Boston in America. He died in Brighton in December, 1894. Resettlement of the Fletcher-Vane estates Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland In anticipation of the marriage of his second son, Francis Fletcher-Vane, to Diana Olivia Beauclerk in 1823, the Fletcher-Vane estates were resettled, the trustees being many of the leading Whig politicians and lawyers of the time: *Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, the nephew of Charles James Fox; * Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet, a political ally of Sir Frederick; * Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet GCB PC; * Reverend Fergus Graham; * Edward Hassell of Dalemain Castle who married Julia Musgrave, daughter of Sir Philip Musgrave, Bart; * Charles Smallwood-Fetherstonhaugh (d. 7 March 1839), son of the Rev.

The monument was built following the order of Ahmed I Bey to shelter the Sufi brotherhood of which Sidi Brahim Riahi had become the master in Tunis. Later, Sadok Bey improved the decoration 1878 by bringing craftsmen from Morocco, and made it one of the most beautiful architectural jewels of the medina.  Architecture  Access to the building is via a chicane entrance opening onto a courtyard surrounded by various rooms reserved for visitors and an oratory covered by a large dome richly decorated with stucco. This oratory, which also serves as a mosque, overlooks a room where the tombs of Sidi Brahim and his sons are. The zaou√Øa still houses the meetings of his tariqa.

Quinaria species are part of the Drosophila subgenus.  Mushroom-feeding ecology  The fly agaric Amanita muscaria Quinaria group species are commonly found on wild mushrooms, and can metabolize toxic compounds in Amanita mushrooms, such as ibotenic acid. Mushroom sites also host a number of natural enemies. For instance, as a consequence of their mushroom-feeding ecology, Quinaria species are frequently infected by nematodes of the genus Howardula. Some Quinaria species are more or less susceptible to nematode parasitization, though the immunological reasons remain unclear. One possibility to explain this variance is differences in defensive bacterial symbionts. The ancestor of Quinaria species and related flies likely switched from a generalist ecology to become exclusively mushroom-feeders. From there, different mushroom-feeding lineages emerged, some of which reverted to feeding on decaying vegetation, such as Drosophila quinaria. Understanding the evolutionary forces that promoted a mushroom-feeding lifestyle, or reversion back to a more generalist ecology, can help understand concepts such as speciation and genetics of adaptation. Quinaria group species such as Drosophila falleni are attracted to mushroom sites by cuing in on specific odourants that are common in rotting mushrooms, such as 1-pentanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Compared to Drosophila melanogaster, D. falleni are attracted to far more specific cues from rotting mushrooms. When D. falleni are infected by Howardula nematodes, infected flies become more averse to acetate-containing compounds such as ethyl acetate or propyl acetate. Conversely, infected flies become more attracted to 1-nonanol. This observation ties behavioural change to infection status, specifically identifying compounds that the fly becomes more or less averse to. Comparisons between mushroom-feeding Drosophila and D. melanogaster, and also between mushroom-specific Howardula parasitic nematodes and generalist nematodes could yield insight into how host-pathogen interactions alter olfactory preferences. Systematics Evidence from phylogenetic studies suggests that the Quinaria group may be paraphyletic, comprising two clades. However, different phylogenetic analysis methods yield different results, so the exact systematics of the Quinaria group are still not fully confirmed. =Phylogeny= ASTRAL phylogenetic cladogram topology from Scott Chialvo and colleagues (2019). = Related species = Quinaria species are related to the Drosophila cardini, Drosophila bizonata, and Drosophila testacea species groups. Evolutionary studies in these various mushroom-feeding Drosophila have contributed to understanding how symbiotic bacteria can drastically affect host evolution, the impact of various genetic elements in natural populations, and speciation.  Genetics and genomics  Various Quinaria group species have contributed to genetic studies in different fashions. So far the genomes of four Quinaria species, D. guttifera, D. innubila, D. quinaria, and D. palustris have been sequenced. Additional sequence data has been generated for Drosophila falleni and Drosophila phalerata. The genome of D. innubila was sequenced for a study in 2019, and boasts a very complete assembly rivalling that of the classic genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. In September 2020, a study of Drosophila sex pheromone communication sequenced the genomes of D. quinaria, and D. palustris, as well as many outgroup lineages of the Quinaria species group. = Gene regulation on the fly = A comparison of wing patterns in Drosophila quinaria species The patterning of Drosophila wings has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists as understanding the genetic changes underlying wing patterning helps understand how evolution can act to promote novel designs. Drosophila guttifera (the \\"Polka-dotted fruit fly\\") has conspicuous dot patterns on its wings made of black melanin. Different variations of these dot patterns occur in different Quinaria group species, ranging from no spots on the wings in D. innubila, to wing bands in D. recens, to conspicuous polka- dots in D. guttifera. One method to study these patterns has been to compare gene regulation amongst different Drosophila species. The Drosophila Wnt signalling pathway regulates wing development. In the Wnt pathway, the Wingless gene encodes a ligand involved in the local development of melanin synthesis in the wing. Other genes in the Wnt signalling pathway such as yellow and ebony are also involved in melanin regulation. Studies in the major genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster are how the Wnt signalling pathway was first suspected. These studies implicated genes such as Wingless in wing development through mutations in Wnt signalling and the Wingless gene. Following this, studies in different species such as Drosophila biarmipes and Drosophila guttifera revealed different patterns of yellow gene expression. As a result of these comparative studies, and owing to its attractive wing patterning, D. guttifera is now used as a comparative model to understand gene network interactions amongst Wingless, yellow, and other Wnt signalling genes. Understanding how these networks cooperate to regulate wing patterning also helps scientists understand how gene regulatory networks work in other systems such as health or development. Using conspicuous patterns like polka dot distribution on wings makes understanding general principles of gene regulation more approachable. In 2015, the genome of Drosophila guttifera was sequenced by the laboratory of Sean B. Carroll providing an answer on how different wing patterns emerge in this species. The authors found that additional copies of genetic switches called \\"enhancers\\" drives the polka-dot pattern on the wings of D. guttifera. These enhancers were a subset of cis- regulatory elements. As such, new evolutionary patterns can arise without modifying the active gene, by instead modifying existing enhancer regions. This leads to different patterns of gene expression, in the case of D. guttifera, resulting in different patterning on its wings. = Population genetics and speciation = Sympatric speciation, where reproductive isolation evolves within a population without the aid of geographic barriers. Speciation describes when two populations diverge sufficiently such that they are considered different species, often because they can no longer successfully reproduce with one another. This process is intuitive for conspicuous examples such as ring species, wherein a population splits due to a geographical barrier such as a mountain range, leading to allopatric populations. However why species diverge when their geographic ranges overlap (sympatric speciation) is less understood. The sister species Drosophila subquinaria and Drosophila recens overlap in geographic range and are capable of hybridization, meaning they can successfully reproduce with each other; however the offspring are very sickly. Thus, these two species are almost fully reproductively isolated, despite overlapping in geographic range. One reason for this is behavioural, driven by pheromones. D. subquinaria females readily avoid mating with males from other species, but surprisingly D. subquinaria females also avoid mating with males from the same species in allopatric populations. However D. recens females do not distinguish between males from different populations. Pheromones in the cuticle of the males differ between geographic ranges of D. subquinaria, possibly explaining how females distinguish males from different populations. The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia is common in populations of D. recens, and causes cytoplasmic incompatibility in crosses between D. recens males and D. subquinaria females. This has led to D. subquinaria females in sympatry with Wolbachia-infected D. recens to be more choosy when making a mate choice, while D. subquinaria females that are not sympatric with D. recens do not make this distinction. The D. subquinaria species complex is made all the more challenging to interpret by continued gene flow between D. recens and D. subquinaria. Beyond these two species, Drosophila transversa is also capable of hybridization with both D. subquinaria and D. recens. Ginsberg and colleagues showed that the direction of gene flow is biased from D. recens into sympatric populations of D. subquinaria. This is likely due to increased one-directional mating success between D. recens females and D. subquinaria males in sympatry, but may also depend on the efficiency with which the D. recens X chromosome acts in a D. subquinaria genetic background. Much of the work characterizing subquinaria- recens speciation is built on a body of work initiated in the 1970s by John Jaenike and fellow researchers.  Microbial Symbiosis  Symbiosis refers to the interactions amongst living organisms. These interactions can range from parasitism to mutual benefit. Often whether something should be considered a parasite or a beneficial symbiont is context-dependent. For instance, reproductive manipulators like Spiroplasma bacteria can kill their hosts sperm to benefit the symbiont at the cost of the host. But these same bacteria can defend the host against immune challenge by parasites. =Endosymbionts= Bacterial endosymbionts are bacteria that live inside host compartments like inside host cells or in the blood. Endosymbionts are widespread in insects. The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia infects anywhere from 20 to 70% of all insects, while Spiroplasma is found in ~10% of Drosophila. These endosymbionts can have a number of different consequences from cytoplasmic incompatibility, male-killing, feminization, or defensive symbiosis. Transmission electron micrograph of Wolbachia bacteria in an insect cell.  Wolbachia  Wolbachia is the most widespread of bacterial endosymbionts in insects and arthropods. Wolbachia bacteria are distant relatives of mitochondria, and like mitochondria, live inside host cells. Also like mitochondria, Wolbachia are inherited through females, so sons and daughters inherit Wolbachia almost exclusively from their mothers. Wolbachia are also commonly referred to as reproductive parasites. In different insects and arthropods, Wolbachia manipulate host reproduction to increase the number of females in the population. This benefits the Wolbachia as they are passed on from mothers to their offspring. Drosophila recens is commonly infected with a Wolbachia bacterial endosymbiont that causes cytoplasmic incompatibility. Females infected with this Wolbachia can readily mate with any male, regardless of the male's Wolbachia infection status. However uninfected females cannot mate with infected males. As such, Wolbachia infection in the population puts uninfected females at a mating disadvantage, as some proportion of their matings will not produce offspring. Moreover, the uninfected females invest resources into developing non-viable eggs, further reducing the reproductive fitness of uninfected females. Wolbachia from Drosophila capable of cytoplasmic incompatibility are being explored for their potential to introduce laboratory-reared organisms for biocontrol, such as mosquitoes that do not transmit dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever. Drosophila innubila is a species commonly infected with a Wolbachia bacterial endosymbiont that causes male-killing. Male-killing results in the offspring of flies being entirely female, the biological sex with the higher reproductive output. Thus, while this reduces the number of viable eggs an infected female can produce, this Wolbachia spreads in the population owing to the increased reproductive output of females when compared to males. Female flies lay hundreds of eggs over their lifespan, and can store sperm in a specialized organ called the spermatheca. Thus, females do not need to mate repeatedly to successfully produce eggs. Meanwhile, males first have to successfully mate with a female, and then also win battles against other males through sperm competition, which is a prominent example of sexual selection.https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/people/faculty/jaenike_john/ Drosophila innubila is also commonly infected by the double-stranded DNA virus Drosophila innubila nudivirus (DiNV), the consequences of which are unknown. It has been shown that certain Wolbachia can protect their hosts against viral infection, even leading to biocontrol strategies that use Wolbachia infection to suppress the spread of viral diseases. What role (if any) Wolbachia plays in defence against DiNV is unclear.  Spiroplasma  Spiroplasma sp. are inherited bacterial symbionts that protect flies from parasites like wasps or nematodes. So far, Spiroplasma has been recovered from one Quinaria group species, Drosophila tenebrosa. While Spiroplasma of Drosophila flies typically derive from the poulsonii or citri clades, the Spiroplasma of D. tenebrosa is highly divergent and currently classified in its own clade. While Spiroplasma of Drosophila melanogaster can also exhibit male-killing, the D. tenebrosa Spiroplasma did not. It is possible that this Spiroplasma defends D. tenebrosa against parasites, as horizontal gene transfer of defensive genes amongst Spiroplasmas of mushroom-feeding flies has been observed, even amongst different Spiroplasma clades that infect very different groups of flies. = The gut microbiome = Colorized electron micrograph of a probiotic Lactobacillus species How animals select and shape their microbiota is of great interest to a number of research fields, particularly for the implications on human and animal health. As a powerful model organism for genetics, the gut microbiome of D. melanogaster has been researched extensively. Common species in this microbiome include Lactobacillus plantarum and Acetobacter species, which are highly beneficial for the fly's development. Individuals lacking these bacterial associates develop slower, mature to a smaller size, and have reduced reproductive fitness. Secondary metabolites produced by these bacteria appear to be responsible for mediating these bacteria-host interactions, notably including lactate. Lactate-producing bacteria are a core element of the human gut microbiome, and abundance of lactate is implicated in colonic disease. Additionally, lactate metabolism can lead to butyrate production in individuals with certain gut microbes such as Eubacterium; butyrate is associated with intestinal distress. Lactobacillus sp. are also important bacteria in human development for milk digestion in infants, and are used as probiotics to help re-establish the microbiome in individuals following antibiotic treatment. Core components of the innate immune system are common amongst all animals, from humans to fruit flies, and innate immunity is central to mediating interactions of the host and its gut microbes. Understanding the biochemical basis of how metabolites (e.g. lactate) stimulate healthy development helps develop probiotic therapies aiming to improve gut health, particularly after the microbiome has been perturbed following illness and antibiotic treatments. Despite the many benefits of microbial colonization in D. melanogaster, its gut microbiome requires replenishment from the environment, as the microbiome is lost over time in sterile conditions. Thus, D. melanogaster acquires its gut microbes from its food, a form of facultative symbiosis. However a recent report suggests some species of these bacteria can stably colonize the gut in wild populations. Comparisons amongst Drosophila have been used to determine if core components of the microbiome are common amongst different species with very different food resources and life histories; the idea being that if core bacteria are common to all Drosophila species despite totally different ecologies, that would imply that the gut microbiome is an important component of development, and that evolution selects on the host and its microbiome collectively as a single unit, often referred to as the \\"holobiont.\\" The existence of a \\"holobiont\\" level of selection acting on facultative symbionts is a controversial topic amongst evolutionary biologists, as the relationships between the host and these facultative symbionts is unstable and the two sides face distinct selective pressures. Globally this is thought to lead to largely independent evolution of the host from its facultative gut symbionts. No bacterial species are common amongst 100% of Drosophila species, though four major species represent 85% of the gut microbiome of all Drosophila screened so far. While most Quinaria species feed on rotting mushrooms rife with bacteria, the gut microbiome of these mushroom-feeding flies differs drastically in composition from the bacterial communities on the mushrooms they visit. This suggests the host fly can selectively incorporate beneficial bacteria into its gut microbiome, and reject non-beneficial bacteria. The mechanism behind how mushroom-feeding flies can selectively maintain their gut microbiota despite feeding on rotting mushroom is still unclear. Comparisons between the associations of other Drosophila and Quinaria group species may yield insight into both the host and bacterial mechanisms necessary for establishing a stable bacterial community.  Immunity  Mushroom-feeding Drosophila are commonly infested by nematodes and parasitic wasps. These pose important challenges for the host immune system with significant impacts on fitness and fertility. = Parasitic infection = Dissected Drosophila falleni infected with Howardula aoronymphium nematodes Many Quinaria group species are infected by parasitic nematodes of the genus Howardula, especially Howardula aoronymphium. Infection by these nematodes can sterilize flies, or alter their olfactory preferences. Some Quinaria group species are more or less susceptible to different nematode parasites. For instance, D. falleni and D. neotestacea are sterilized by Howardula aoronymphium nematodes, while related species resist infection. This sterilization is associated with reduced expression of genes involved in egg development, and increases in cuticle synthesis pathways. Mushroom-feeding Drosophila are used as a model for understanding the genetic basis of nematode susceptibility or resistance, which may lead to a better understanding of how the innate immune system responds to nematode parasites. Of note, while Drosophila melanogaster has an extremely well-characterized immune system and boasts powerful genetic tools, no nematode parasite naturally infects D. melanogaster. This has hampered the use of Drosophila as a model for interactions between nematodes and the innate immune system. Mushroom-feeding Drosophila are also frequently parasitized by parasitoid wasps such as Leptopilina sp.. These wasps infest the fly larva by inserting their ovipositor into the larva and depositing an egg internally. The wasp larvae hatch within the host, and remain relatively benign until fly pupation. This is because the wasp larva requires the fly larva to develop to the point of pupation so the wasp itself can metamorphose within the puparium in place of the fly. This process ultimately kills the fly, which is devoured by the developing wasp. Parasitic wasps also frequently inject toxins or even virus-like particles alongside their eggs that suppress the host immune response to increase the success of the wasp larva. In response, the fly immune system attempts to encapsulate invading wasp larva and attacks them using the insect melanization response. In D. melanogaster, specialized blood cells called lamellocytes that regulate local melanin synthesis during capsule formation. However these blood cells are absent in other Drosophila species. Despite this, these other Drosophila can nonetheless suppress wasp development through unknown immune mechanisms, though susceptibility varies by species of fly and species of wasp. In some species, the bacterial symbiont Spiroplasma protects related mushroom-feeding Drosophila from wasp parasitization using toxins that selectively kill the wasp larva but not the host fly, an interaction well-characterized using comparisons between Spiroplasma from D. melanogaster and the mushroom-feeding Drosophila neotestacea. Different mite parasites are also common at mushroom sites. Mites are external parasites that latch onto the fly abdomen and feed on the hemolymph. Mite bites or parasitic wasp stings are a natural mechanism to introduce infections. They may also serve as a mechanism to introduce and distribute bacterial endosymbionts between different fly species. = Immune response = The genome of D. innubila was sequenced in 2019, and highlighted the importance of the interaction between D. innubila and its viruses as implied by patterns of immune evolution in antiviral genes. Notably, natural selection on the immunity and antiviral pathways in D. innubila differ markedly from D. melanogaster, implying divergent evolutionary pressures. The DiNV DNA virus is similar to the D. melanogaster Kallithea virus. As such, comparisons between D. melanogaster and D. innubila and their viruses promise to inform on the nature of host-virus interactions. The antimicrobial peptide gene Diptericin B has been pseudogenized in two independent lineages of mushroom-feeding fruit flies: the Quinaria group species Drosophila guttifera and the more distantly related Drosophila neotestacea. Diptericin B is conserved in all other Drosophila species, yet these two pseudogenization events in mushroom-breeding flies were independent, suggesting Diptericin B is actively lost in these species. However Diptericin B is retained in Drosophila innubila, and remains transcriptionally active. It also seems that unrelated Tephritid fruit flies have independently derived a Diptericin gene strikingly similar to the Drosophila Diptericin B gene. These evolutionary patterns in mushroom-breeding Drosophila and other fruit flies suggests that the immune system's effectors (like antimicrobial peptides) are directly shaped by host ecology. Diptericins are important immune molecules in defence against Providencia bacteria, and Diptericin B has also been shown to affect memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. The loss of Diptericin B in these mushroom-breeding flies implies that this immune molecule is unimportant for the ecology of mushroom- feeding flies, but somehow important for other fruit flies in the genus Drosophila.

Sebidi's work has been represented in private and public collections, including at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington and New York the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, New York, and the World Bank. Her work has been recognised internationally and locally. In 1989 she won the Standard Bank Young Artist award, becoming the first black woman to win the award. In 2004, President Thabo Mbeki awarded her the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver ‚Äì which is the highest honor given to those considered a \\"national treasure\\". In 2011, she was awarded the Arts and Culture Trust (ACT) Lifetime Achievement Award for Visual Art, whilst in 2015 she received the Mbokodo Award. In September 2018, Sebidi was honoured with one of the first solo presentations at the Norval Foundation in Cape Town ‚Äì a retrospective entitled Batlhaping Ba Re. Her work represents a mode of African modernist painting and sculpture, wherein she depicts her experience of having grown up and living in the South African countryside, and later her experiences as a black artist, living and working under an apartheid regime. Sebidi's portraits often depict abstracted African subjects in bright colours and a rich palette. She is often associated with the realist and quasi- expressionist schools, with her vivid paintings of life in both rural and urban South Africa and similarly striking clay sculptures.  Early life  Mmakgabo Mmapula Helen Sebidi was born in Marapyane, outside Hammanskraal, South Africa. She learned the crafts of murals, knitting and sewing, embroidery and beadwork, and calabash decoration from her grandmother. Sebidi's name, \\"Mmakgabo\\", which means \\"keeper of the flame\\", refers to her grandmother's work ethic and belief in vocational labor's role in creating community. Sebidi was born to a working class mother, who was a domestic worker in the city of Johannesburg. As was typical of children born to migrant labourers, Helen was raised in the country side by her grandmother who taught her mural painting and pyroengraving of calabashes. In an interview, the artist speaks about the relevance of seTswana storytelling as imagination and art education: > The old people told us stories...about how people live and...about how to > see. They \\"read\\" the clouds. We used to sit outside in the courtyard, and > especially in the very bright moonlight when there were a lot of clouds they > used to read the stories for us and tell us‚Äîlook at that, look at the > soldiers, look at this! And they would tell us‚Äîyou're going to have to see > other life that's coming. As a teenager, Sebidi became a domestic worker and estranged from her mother and her husband. Sebidi sewed and knitted and decided to pursue her art in her off-time with encouragement from the wife of her employer, who also pushed Sebidi towards formal training. Sebidi exchanged artistic techniques with her employer who in turn demonstrated the application of artistic media such as batik, tie-dye, and oil paintings.  Career  Sebidi took classes at Dorkay House after meeting Jonathan Koenakeefe Mohl by chance. She studied drawing with him, progressing from plants to landscapes to local architecture. Sebidi returned her hometown when her grandmother grew ill in the mid-1970s. She made art about her lineage at the encouragement of Mohl through her grandmother's death in the early 1980s. Her grandmother let her work in secret and offered historical stories for Sebidi. She made connections with multiple arts organizations and artists Bill Ainslie and David Koloane. Sebidi explored a number of the limited art training options that were available to her at the time. Sebidi met John Koenakeefe Mohl, a fellow artist and director of the White Studio. Mohl served as Sebidi's mentor and is credited for having encouraged Sebidi to pursue a career as an artist, and urging her to develop an individual idiom, establish an independent style and practice as opposed to emulating that of her peers. In 1980, Sebidi furthered her training by spending eighteen months at the Katlehong Art Centre in the east of Johannesburg. She also spent time at the Johannesburg Art Foundation-a multi cultural centre for art education, under the tutelage of fine artist and director Bill Ainslie. In 1985, she took up a teaching position at the Katlehong Art Centre near Germiston. Between 1986 and 1988 she worked for the Johannesburg Art Foundation while teaching at the Alexandra Art Centre. Her work was part of the group exhibition \\"Bild/konst i s√∂dra Afrika (Art/Images in Southern Africa)\\" which was shown at the Culture House in Stockholm from 19 May to 19-September 1989 and toured the Nordic countries until May 1990. In the late 1980s, her works became more abstracted without losing their figurative content. Miracle (1987) and Tears of Africa (1988) were two of her seminal works from this era, both in mixed-media charcoal and depicting \\"contorted, cramped figures with distorted or multiplied features and faces sometimes meeting at right angles\\". She received the 1989 Standard Bank Young Artist Award. A common theme in Sebidi's artwork is the return of moral values, especially those associated with precolonial Africa.

History  Members of Honour Unit in former uniforms during laying of wreath on Monument to the fallen fighters in WWII near \\"Bosna\\" Hotel in Banja Luka Unit is formed on 2002 when it was seen that one unit of this type is necessary for the Ministry of Interior and for protocol needs of this institution. Firstly unit had only 8 members for guards purpose only, because there wasn't any need for real honour guard. One of the police officers was chosen to take the role of commander of unit. Their uniform was as same as uniform of high-ranked police officers. Little bit later, unit numbered 50 members which stayed till today. In first years of existence unit was prepared to participate on every important day for Republika Srpska. Before new form of this unit, number of members was decreased to 23 police officers because of new police structure. When it was seen by Administration for protection of persons and objects, which was obligated about the unit, but before known as Unit for protection persons and objects, that number of 23 police officers is not sufficient for this kind of unit, then started new selection plan. From 60 police officers and 10 female police officers, final number was 50 police officers which became members of new honour unit. In that number of 50 officers is 45 male and 5 female officers. After selection, unit was prepared and trained for future needs, mainly drill commands and step. Also, Ministry of Interior started obtaining semi-automatic rifles, new uniforms and officer saber. Everything is later regulated by law. Use of unit is regulated by Instructions for use of Honour Unit of the Ministry of Interior of Republika Srpska.  Role and commanders  Unit's main role is celebration of important days of Republika Srpska and the Ministry of Interior. Those days are Republic Day, Day of the Police of Republika Srpska, slava of the Ministry of Interior and so on. Usually duties of unit are rapports, guard in front of buildings of republic importance (Palace of the Republic) or on time when is meeting between two heads of states, from which one is from Republika Srpska, honours, inaugurations and laying of wreaths.

He was punished on the orders of the caliph and died shortly after between 857 and 861. Life He was the son of al-Sikkƒ´t, a philologist of the K≈´fƒ´ school of grammar, a man of science, and an associate of the scholars al-KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ and al-FarrƒÅ‚Äô. Where the father excelled in poetry and linguistics, the son excelled in grammar. His father originated from the village of Dawraq, Ahwaz Khuzestan (Iran), Ya‚Äòq≈´b was a scholar of BaghdƒÅd, which followed the K≈´fƒ´ school tradition in grammar, Qur‚Äôanic science and poetry. He studied and recorded the pure Arabic language from the Desert Arabs. He tutored the sons of al-Mutawakkil, who were Al-Muntasir and Al- Mu'tazz. Ya‚Äòq≈´b‚Äôs surname was Ab≈´ Y≈´suf and his son, Y≈´suf, was a court companion and personally close to the caliph al-Mu‚Äòta·∏çid. He was a disciple of Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAmr al-ShaybƒÅnƒ´, Mu·∏•ammad ibn Muhanna, and Mu·∏•ammad ibn Subh ibn as- SammƒÅq. He taught the philology of al-Asma øi, Ab≈´ Ubaidah, and al-FarrƒÅ‚Äô. Is·∏•ƒÅq al-Nadƒ´m records that he was a pupil of Na·π£rƒÅn al-KhurƒÅsƒÅni. Na·π£rƒÅn had transmitted the poetry of al-Kumayt with ‚ÄòUmar ibn Bukayr and Ibn al-Sikkƒ´t, who had memorised Na·π£rƒÅn's books had a bitter disagreement about Na·π£rƒÅn‚Äòs teachings with the K≈´fƒ´ scholar, al-·π¨≈´sƒ´. The account of al-Sikkƒ´t, related by al-Nadim through the classical isnƒÅd source-system, cites the narrator-chain of Ab≈´ Sa‚Äòƒ´d, Ab≈´ Bakr ibn Durayd and al-RiyƒÅshƒ´, in an account illustrative of the active intellectual exchange between the two rival schools of Ba·π£rah and K≈´fah in the 9th century. A group of wƒÅrraq≈´n of al-K≈´fah gathered for a reading aloud by a warrƒÅq of al-Ba·π£rah, of Ibn al-Sikkƒ´t‚Äôs Book of Logic. Al- RiyƒÅshƒ´ was at the event and attested that Ibn al-Sikkƒ´t had told him, that he had learned the vernacular dialects of Southern ‚ÄòIrƒÅq from ·∏§arashat al-·∏åibƒÅb and Aklat al-YarƒÅbƒ´, and they had derived theirs from the people of al-SawƒÅd. He mentions examples of words such as ‚Äúakalah al-kuwƒÅmƒ´kh‚Äù and ‚Äúal-shawƒÅrƒ´z.\\" The tests of rivalry between schools is illustrated in another account given by al-Nadim, told as a kind of cautionary tale. When al-Athram, a young scholar from al-Ba·π£rah, challenges Ya‚Äòq≈´b ibn al-Sikkƒ´t, a senior scholar of al-K≈´fah school, on a verse by the poet al-RƒÅ‚Äôƒ´, he clearly breaks the etiquette code that always ranks seniority above juniority.

In the post-war military, he eventually rose to command the 3rd Division in the post war military, before serving on the Military Board, as the Citizen Military Forces member before retiring in 1964. He was a banker in civilian life, rising to the role of assistant-inspector of the National Bank of Australasia. He died in 1971, at the age of 64. Early life Simpson was born on 22 February 1907, in Balmain, New South Wales, to Harry and Annie Simpson. His father was an orchardist who had been born in Sydney, while his mother, Annie (), had migrated from New Zealand. Noel was the younger of a set of twin boys; his brother, Grosvenor, would also undertake military service, and the pair were both initially commissioned into the Militia 17th Battalion, although Grosvenor would later serve in the British Army and would be killed at Anzio in 1944. After completing his schooling at North Sydney Boys' High School, Simpson joined the National Bank of Australasia in late 1922; he would remain with them for his entire working life except for the period of his war service. Military career While employed by the National Bank of Australasia in civilian life, Simpson began his military service in 1925, serving in the part time military forces. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1926 and served in a number of infantry battalions ‚Äì the 17th, 25th/33rd, 34th and 45th ‚Äì during the inter-war years, rising to the rank of major by the time the Second World War broke out. Volunteering for overseas service, Simpson was appointed to the Second Australian Imperial Force and posted to the 2/13th Battalion as second-in-command. He deployed to the Middle East with them in late 1940, but shortly after arrival, he was seconded to the headquarters staff of the 7th Division, and later in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign against the Vichy French in mid-1941. In early 1942, he returned to the 2/13th before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1942 and taking command of the 2/17th Battalion; at this time he gained a reputation for his thorough training methods, and he subsequently led the battalion successfully through the Second Battle of El Alamein as the Allies launched a heavy offensive against the Germans and Italians in North Africa. In 1943, Simpson's unit was brought back to Australia in preparation for operations against the Japanese in New Guinea. They undertook intensive training in Queensland, including amphibious landings, which eventually paid dividends when the 2/17th took part in the Huon Peninsula campaign, carrying out a landing at Scarlet Beach on 22 September 1943. Throughout September and October, despite being wounded, Simpson led the battalion in heavy fighting around Kumawa, and then Jivevaneng, where they held off a Japanese force that had threatened to encircle them. As the Australians then advanced on Sattelberg in November, Simpson temporarily commanded the 24th Brigade and then later the 20th Brigade. After returning to Australia, Simpson was posted to the 2/43rd Battalion, commanding them as they undertook training in Queensland ahead of the Borneo campaign. However, he would not see action with them; instead, Simpson was promoted to brigadier in March 1945 and placed in command of the 29th Brigade, a Militia formation tasked with joining II Corps' 3rd Division on Bougainville, where the Australians had begun a limited offensive after taking over from US forces in late 1944. Prior to Simpson's arrival, the 29th Brigade had relieved the US 182nd Infantry Regiment before commencing the advance along the southern coast in December 1944. After about a month, the brigade returned to the main Allied base around Torokina for a rest. Simpson arrived on Bougainville on 28 March, and the following month the brigade began defensive operations protecting the supply lines that were maintaining the Australian thrust towards the Japanese stronghold around Buin. In July, the brigade was tasked with resuming the offensive, commencing with crossing the Mivo River, but as patrols began to push forward towards the Oami River heavy rain brought the drive to a premature halt, with the war ending before it could resume in August. Simpson took over command of the 23rd Brigade in November 1945, and led the formation back to Australia where it was demobilised in mid-1946 at Watsonia, Victoria. After the war, Simpson resumed his civilian career with National Bank, but returned to the part time military in the post war period. He was the honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor General in 1950, and between 1950 and 1953 filled a staff role in Eastern Command. In 1953‚Äì1958, he commanded the 6th Brigade before being promoted to major general and taking over the 3rd Division in 1959‚Äì1960. In 1960‚Äì1962, he was the Citizen Military Forces representative of the Military Board ‚Äì essentially holding the highest position available for a part-time officer ‚Äì before going on to the Reserve of Officers list for the final part of his career. He retired from military service on 23 February 1964, having reached compulsory retirement age after nearly 40 years service. Later life and legacy During the war, Simpson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions during the fighting around El Alamein and was awarded a Bar to the DSO for his role in the early part of the Huon Peninsula campaign. He was later mentioned in despatches (1947), and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (1956) and a Commander of the Order of the Bath (1963). He was also awarded the Efficiency Decoration in 1946. In his later life, Simpson continued to work for National Bank, serving as an assistant inspector until he retired in 1966. He died on 18 November 1971 in Heidelberg, Victoria. He never married.

Career Gervasius or Geruasius started his ecclesiastical career as a member of the royal chapel during the reign of G√©za II of Hungary. He was styled as royal chaplain in 1146 and 1150. He was described as \\"high-skilled, remarkably cultivated man\\" by chronicler Rahewin. He was elected Bishop of Gy≈ër in 1156. Becoming a member of the royal council, he interceded with G√©za II in March 1157 to grant the collection right of salt duties to the Archdiocese of Esztergom at N√°na and Kakat (present-day ≈†t√∫rovo, Slovakia). Through his intercession, G√©za II also granted some privileges to the cathedral chapter of Gy≈ër. Still in the same year, Gervasius contributed and permitted the foundation of the Benedictine Abbey of K√ºsz√©n (later N√©met√∫jv√°r, present-day Burg G√ºssing in Austria) to comes Wolfer, a Carinthian-born knight and ancestor of the K≈ëszegi family. Gervasius subordinated the monastery to the Pannonhalma Abbey. According to the contemporaneous Rahewin, G√©za's younger brother Stephen was \\"accused before the king of aspiring to royal power\\". In fear of being seized and executed by his brother, Stephen sought refuge in the Holy Roman Empire in summer 1157. Upon the emperor's demand, who favored Stephen, G√©za accepted Frederick Barbarossa as arbitrator in his conflict with Stephen and sent his envoys ‚Äì Judge royal H√©der (Wolfer's brother) and Bishop Gervasius ‚Äì to the Imperial Diet at Regensburg in January 1158. There the envoys refused Stephen's accusations and have successfully achieved that Frederick took a neutral position, who \\"decided to defer to a more suitable time the settlement\\" of the quarrel between G√©za and Stephen.

He authored commentaries on the Babylonian Talmud and Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer. Biography He was born to a wealthy family in Bykhov in the Russian Empire (now in eastern Belarus). His family was descended from Solomon Luria (Maharshal), which claimed descent from Rashi and thence to King David. At age 12 he moved to study in Vilna, in connection with an arranged marriage which he entered at age 13. At age 18 he returned to Bykhov and contributed to the establishment of a yeshiva there.Daat ‚Äì Encyclopedia Yehudit, David Luria, Radal He was known for his great memory, which allowed him to compose works including comparisons of various textual variants of the Talmud and midrashic works. At age 40 he fell victim to a libel. Letters from him, and passages in his commentary to Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, were forged indicating a supposed call to rebellion against the Russian Empire. He was jailed for six months in the Shlisselburg prison, after which his name was cleared. The motivation for the libel is speculated to be a dispute between various families in Bykhov. He was considered one of the leaders of Eastern European Jewry in the era following the Vilna Gaon, and had extensive involvement in public affairs. In 1846, he met Moses Montefiore with the intent of informing him of the situation of Russian Jews at the time.

The State of Texas had created Greer County in 1860, and thereafter claimed jurisdiction over it, but this issue had been argued in the United States courts at several levels and for many years. By 1896, the issue had already been litigated again. At last, the Supreme Court rejected Texas' claims. The U.S. Congress quickly passed legislation that declared the land as under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government and attached it to the Territory of Oklahoma, effective May 4, 1896.The Romance of Oklahoma.

A local legend claimed that Judge Brown was trying an important case that morning when he was interrupted by a messenger who brought him the news that had just arrived on the telegraph. Judge Brown immediately adjourned the court and announced that he no longer had jurisdiction over the case. He allegedly announced to everyone in the courtroom that \\"... We opened court in Greer County, Texas, but will close court in Greer County, Oklahoma.\\" Many settlers in the county were concerned about the status of their claims over land they had bought while it was still part of Texas. They asked Brown to go to Washington to secure their claims. He agreed, and after meeting with President Cleveland and Attorney General Harmon, who concurred. Congress quickly passed the necessary legislation to secure these prior claims.  Career in Oklahoma  Brown moved in 1903 to the town of Magnum, then in Greer County, Oklahoma Territory. After Oklahoma became a state on November 16, 1907, Brown was elected Judge of the Oklahoma 18th Judicial District. He was reelected to that position in November, 1910. In the election of November 1914, Brown was elected to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, filling the unexpired term of Judge Jesse Dunn, who had died during his term, even as Brown moved his own family to Oklahoma City.

She was born in Wembonyama, Sankuru, Belgian Congo. Marriage She married Patrice Lumumba on March 15, 1951, was his third wife, bore him four children, Patrice, Juliana, Roland and Marie-Christine.Adedeji Ademola, Why Patrice Lumumba's widow marched bare-breasted across Leopoldville in 1961, F2FA, January 17, 2019 It was an at times difficult relationship, and the couple were separated by Patrice's imprisonment on more than one occasion. Pauline never remarried, reportedly because she was unable to \\"find someone else of the same quality\\". Patrice Lumumba Patrice Lumumba is one of the iconic figures in the decolonisation of Africa. Much of the Congo Basin was a colony of Belgium, from 1885 as a virtual private fiefdom of Leopold II, until its annexation by the Belgian state in 1908. Patrice Lumumba helped to found the Mouvement National Congolais and was elected the first Prime Minister of the independent Republic of Congo in 1960. Within a year of his election, Patrice Lumumba was shot by firing squad after his government was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat. A 23-year-old Pauline Lumumba watched as her husband was arrested, beaten, and taken away by his murderers. Activism Lumumba seemed to believe he would be killed, and wrote to Pauline encouraging her to carry on his work after his death. He asked Pauline to build a sense of pride in Congo's history, and to counter the \\"degrading\\" and \\"shameful\\" influence of Belgium, and other Western countries, in the national culture. Pauline's first action in response to the letter was her participation in demonstrations by her husband's followers in support of decolonizing the Congo. On February 14, 1961, Pauline marched through the African neighbourhoods of the city bare-breasted, accompanied by nearly 100 of her late husband's followers, to the United Nations Headquarters. The women's bare-breasted protest (men walked behind with bowed heads) was to protest Patrice Lumumba's death. At the UN HQ Pauline, with Albert Lumumba, Joseph Lutula, and Pauline's young son, whom she carried in her arms, met with Rajeshwar Dayal, a UN representative. As a result of the meeting, the UN agreed to help find her late husband's body, which Pauline wanted to give a Christian burial to in the capital, L√©opoldville. Aftermath Threatened by her late husband's enemies, Pauline was forced to flee Congo and was found refuge in Egypt thanks to President Nasser. From Egypt she traveled to Belgium and France before returning to Congo after the government recognized Patrice Lumumba as a national hero. Pauline Opango Lumumba lived the rest of her years in the Democratic Republic of Congo. On December 23, 2014, at the age of 78, Pauline died while sleeping in her home in Kinshasa, Congo.

It is a tribute to Brazilian musician and composer Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, with most of the songs recorded in his house in Rio de Janeiro, using his grand piano. Casa featured the first recording ever of Jobim's composition entitled \\"Tema para Ana.\\" The album was released in the United States by Sony Classical. Critical reception Casa has received mostly positive reviews, with a few that were more mixed. Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic said, \\"Paula's soft, dusky voice -- whether singing in English or Portuguese -- is the personification of the Brazilian beach itself, and Jacques' cello amplifies the element of melancholy that runs through much of Jobim. A lovely rendition of ‚ÄòSong of the Sabia‚Äô finds Sakamoto hammering out chords that tie the song to the Chopin E minor prelude, and a nicely swinging ‚ÄòBonita‚Äô has sounds of the sea overdubbed.\\" A BBC review by Nick Reynolds claimed, \\"this remarkable album reinterprets Antonio Jobim's songs in a quietly radical way. It points up his similarities to classical composers like Debussy and Chopin. But it also brings out a bittersweet sadness at the heart of his music.\\" Reynolds praised, \\"the deep, dark keening sound of the cello, the twilight voicings of the piano and the perfect, pure pitch of Paula Morelenbaum's creamy voice.\\" He concluded by saying, \\"This is chamber music of great beauty, which should appeal to both classical music lovers and fans of bossa nova. It's a lovely album.\\" Jazz critic Neil Tesser, writing in Chicago Reader, said, \\"Paula Morelenbaum sings in tones of sweet, dark claret, tinged with saudade, the bittersweet melancholy that deepens Brazilian expressions of love and joy; the sparse accompaniment, marked by the sweeping sadness of the cello, complements this quality, and the near total absence of percussion focuses attention on the purity of the melodies, demonstrating their well-earned place not just as pop phenomena but as genuine 20th-century art songs.\\" Billboard called the album \\"intimately atmospheric\\" and said, \\"with Casa, they have done the world a favor by recording an album of rarely heard songs by bossa nova master Antonio Carlos Jobim.\\" Billboard Editor-in-Chief Timothy White selected Casa as one of the \\"Best Albums of the Year\\" for 2001. Music journalist Ben Ratliff at The New York Times also chose Casa as one of the \\"10 Best Albums\\" of the year, and said, \\"There is something very special about their recent record.\\" In a more mixed review, Jazziz magazine called the album \\"disappointingly monochromatic\\" and said, \\"Casa fails to capture the restrained, emotional essence of the bossa movement. Sakamoto's piano playing, inspired by the French impressionists, is morose and tortuous in a beautiful way. But the ever-present cello robs these tunes of some much-needed swing. Worse yet, the crystalline vocals of Paula Morelenbaum lack the overwhelming personality that defined Astrud Gilberto, Elis Regina, or Maria Creuza.\\" The review also stated, however, that \\"a dedicated listener will find plenty of moments to cherish here, including the frolicsome melody of the lesser-known ‚ÄòImagina.‚Äô Some will even call this an excellent recording, and they might be right.\\" Track listing All songs written by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, except \\"Improvisation (Morelenbaum, Sakamoto).\\" Lyricists indicated. # \\"As Praias Desertas\\" - 3:50 # \\"O Amor em Paz\\" (Vin√≠cius de Moraes) - 3:51 # \\"Vivo Sonhando - Dreamer\\" (Gene Lees) - 4:30 # \\"In√∫til Paisagem\\" (Aloysio de Oliveira) - 4:29 # \\"Sabi√°\\" (Chico Buarque) - 3:49 # \\"Chanson pour Michelle\\" - 3:10 # \\"Bonita\\" (Lees, Ray Gilbert) - 4:22 # \\"Fotografia - Photograph\\" (Gilbert) - 4:18 # \\"Imagina\\" (Buarque) - 2:18 # \\"Estrada Branca\\" (de Moraes) - 4:02 # \\"O Grande Amor\\" (de Moraes) - 4:30 # \\"Can√ß√£o em Modo Menor\\" (de Moraes) - 2:00 # \\"Tema Para Ana\\" - 2:07 # \\"Derradeira Primavera\\" (de Moraes) - 2:21 # \\"Esperan√ßa Perdida - I Was Just One More for You\\" (Billy Blanco, Gilbert) - 4:04 # \\"Sem Voc√™\\" (de Moraes) - 5:07 Bonus Tracks # \\"Samba do Avi√£o\\" (Live) - 5:37 # \\"Improvisation\\" (Live) (Jaques Morelenbaum, Ryuichi Sakamoto) - 7:10 Personnel * Paula Morelenbaum ‚Äì vocals * Jaques Morelenbaum ‚Äì cello * Ryuichi Sakamoto‚Äì piano * Paulo Jobim - guitar (2,15) * Ed Motta - vocals (9) * Luiz Brasil - guitar (3,7,11,17) * Zeca Assumpcao - bass (2-3,7,11) * Marcos Suzano - percussion (3,7-8,11) Production * Paula Morelenbaum ‚Äì producer * Jaques Morelenbaum ‚Äì producer * Ryuichi Sakamoto ‚Äì producer * Hideki Nakajima - art direction, design * Tomoko Yoneda - photography References Bossa nova albums ","title":"Casa (Morelenbaum¬≤/Sakamoto album)"},{"id":"60529526","text":"The fondouk of the French is a caravanserai located in the medina of Tunis in the old franc1 district.

Lifeline provides subscribers a discount on monthly telephone service purchased from participating providers in the marketplace. Subscribers can also purchase discounted broadband from participating providers. Overview Lifeline provides a discount on monthly service of $9.25 per month for eligible low-income subscribers. Subscribers may receive a Lifeline discount on either a wireline or a wireless service, but may not receive a discount on both services at the same time. Lifeline also supports broadband and broadband-voice bundles. FCC rules prohibit more than one Lifeline service per household. Lifeline is available to eligible low-income subscribers in every state, territory, commonwealth, and on tribal lands. To participate in the program, subscribers must either have an income that is at or below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines, or participate in certain assistance programs. In April 2019, the FCC office of Inspector General issued an advisory alert to carriers and beneficiaries in connection to fraudulent enrollment practices.  History  The FCC established the Lifeline program in 1984 during the Ronald Reagan Administration to provide qualified individuals with discounts on phone service. In 1997, the FCC broadened the scope of the program under the 1997 Universal Service Order to make Lifeline more affordable for low-income households by raising the federal support amount. Due to the rise of cell phones, the FCC made more changes in 2005 (under the George W. Bush Administration) so that wireless phone service providers could offer free cell phone service using Lifeline benefits. Lifeline has been controversial due to rampant fraud and abuse of the program. On January 31, 2012, the FCC ordered a Lifeline Reform Order to require that Lifeline subscribers show documentation about their income. This change led to savings of over $213 million in 2012. The FCC under Ajit Pai opened an inquiry in 2017 about excluding wireless resellers, eliminating support of standalone broadband service, and capping the budget of Lifeline. Critics say that these changes would leave millions of poor Americans without phone service. They also say that although 74% of Lifeline subscribers have access to broadband on their smartphone or computer, it is critical to also provide access to standalone broadband service in their homes due to data caps and the usability differences between smartphones and computers. In August 2019, FCC Chairman Pai proposed further administrative changes to root out fraud and abuse of the program. The biggest change in this proposal is to put in additional requirements to ensure that carriers enrolling subscribers can verify that the person is still living. This change will also prohibit carriers from paying commissions to employees or agencies based on the number of customers they enroll. As of August 2019, Pai's latest Lifeline proposal had not been made public, but the FCC said that the lifeline identity verifier would be rolled out in the US by the end of 2019. The Lifeline National Eligibility Verifier (National Verifier) is a centralized system that determines whether subscribers are eligible for Lifeline. USAC manages the National Verifier and its customer service department, the Lifeline Support Center. During the National Verifier soft launch period, service providers will receive access to the National Verifier pre-production (test) environment to test out the system functionalities with mock data. At soft launch, service providers may help consumers apply to the Lifeline Program through the National Verifier service provider portal or by mail. At the National Verifier full (hard) launch, service providers must use the National Verifier when helping consumers apply to the Lifeline Program. Consumers may also apply to the Lifeline Program on their own, through the National Verifier consumer portal or by mail. Please note that any NLAD Dispute Resolution request sent two business days before full (hard) launch will be rejected. If an NLAD transaction requires a dispute resolution within this window, it will need to be performed on or after full (hard) launch.

He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1922, and obtained an LL.B. degree from Ohio State University in 1925. He practiced law from 1926 to 1933, then undertook graduate study at Northwestern University from 1933 to 1935, and became a member of scientific organizations. He published articles in plant science and other journals. He became a serious student of the history of North American botany (and related fields), primarily of the later nineteenth century. In 1940 he published his first book, Noble Fellow. Noble Fellow was an extensive treatise on Rodgers' great grandfather, bryologist William Starling Sullivant; it dealt with Sullivant's heritage and then followed with a thorough discourse on his life and times. In subsequent years he wrote and published six more books on North American botanical topics (see Books). His books received high praise from botanical professionals who reviewed them.

She wrote her dissertation under the title \\"Ingestion as Metaphor and Literary Technique in Rabelais, Milton, Burton, Ruskin, and Northorp Frye,\\" although it was late republished in 1990 by Princeton University Press as \\"From Communion to Cannibalism: An Anatomy of Metaphors of Incorporation.\\" Career Kilgour joined the faculty at McGill University as an English professor. She later served as the department's director of graduate studies. In 1999, Kilgour was promoted to chair of the Department of English. That year, she publicly advocated for the department to recruit new faculty members, noting how the department hand shrunk to 27 professors. From 2006 to 2008, Kilgour also sat as a member of McGill's senate. In 2008, while on sabbatical to write a book regarding the Roman poet Ovid, Kilgour was awarded McGill's Principal's Prize for Excellence in Teaching. In 2012, her book \\"Milton and the Metamorphosis of Ovid\\" was awarded the James Holly Hanford Award by The Milton Society of America. The book focused on how Renaissance writer John Milton interpreted the Roman poet Ovid's work and the influence it has on subsequent classical traditions. She was also accepted as an alternate chair on the University Tenure Committee for the Faculty of Arts until 2015. In 2013, Kilgour collaborated with Elena Lombardi to compose a book of essays regarding Dantean scholars. In response to a perceived lack of interest and budget cuts to the Faculty of Arts in 2014, Kilgour organized a four-part discussion series on the importance of a humanities education and a $500 essay competition to encourage students to enroll in the humanities. Since then, she has organized an annual round table discussion series called \\"McGill for Humanities\\" to help students understand the importance of a humanities education and find careers. In 2015, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. The following year, she earned a visiting fellowship to All Souls College Oxford.

Drosophila innubila is a kind of mushroom-breeding Drosophila, and member of the Drosophila quinaria species group. Drosophila innubila is best-known for its association with a strain of male-killing Wolbachia bacteria. These bacteria are parasitic, as they drain resources from the host and cause half the infected female's eggs to abort. However Wolbachia may offer benefits to the fly's fitness in certain circumstances. The D. innubila genome was sequenced in 2019.  Symbiosis  Drosophila innubila is stably infected by a strain of male-killing Wolbachia bacteria. The association between Drosophila innubila and Wolbachia can vary greatly within local populations. However, their relationship is very consistent across the overall Drosophila innubila species. Male-killing by these Wolbachia results in the offspring of flies being entirely female, the biological sex with the higher reproductive output. Thus, this Wolbachia spreads in the population owing to the increased reproductive advantage of females it infects. However bacterial density varies over development. Bacterial density is lowest in the embryo and increases over the lifespan of the fly, reaching its highest densities in the ovaries of females. Bacterial density directly affects the efficiency of Wolbachia inheritance, as females with lower Wolbachia density also produce daughters with a low bacterial density. The forces driving differences in bacterial density may be epigenetic. If bacterial densities are low enough, females begin to produce males in spite of being infected with male-killing Wolbachia. There is no evidence that a Wolbachia infection can be transmitted horizontally from an infected female fly to an uninfected female fly. Unlike extracellular symbiotic bacteria (e.g. Spiroplasma), Wolbachia live inside their host cells, which likely reduces its ability to move between hosts. Vertical transmission of infection by Wolbachia symbionts through Drosophila. Starting at the top and going clockwise, you have an infected embryo, infected larva, infected pupae, and then in the adult female wolbachia concentrates in the ovaries, ensuring its transmission to the next generation. Infected sons are less likely to die from Wolbachia infection if their mother possessed a smaller bacterial density. It is speculated that the bacterial density of Wolbachia inside a host can vary, depending on the antibiotic activity of larval or adult food sources, possible host defense mechanisms, the age of the host, bacterial interactions within the host, as well as the environmental conditions that the fly experiences. Currently, there is no evidence for a mechanism in Drosophila innubila that suppresses or inhibits the male-killing effect of Wolbachia. Additionally, an unknown factor contributes to increased fitness benefits of Wolbachia infection. The presence of a Wolbachia infection can increase the fitness of a female fly by increasing her size and enhancing her fertility. Moreover, the D. innubila DNA nudivirus \\"DiNV\\" is a common viral infection amongst this species. It has been shown that certain Wolbachia can protect their hosts against viral infection, even leading to biocontrol strategies that use Wolbachia infection to suppress the spread of viral diseases. What role (if any) Wolbachia plays in defense against viruses is unclear. However, other studies that investigated the contribution of Wolbachia infection to the fitness of Drosophila species suggested that the bacteria can enhance survival of its host in the presence of oxidative stressors as well as prevent other pathogens from infecting the host by outcompeting them for host-derived resources like cholesterol. In addition, it is also suspected that Wolbachia may also be able to manipulate the expression of its host's DNA through utilization of host microRNA.  Immunity  The genome of D. innubila was sequenced for a study in 2019, and boasts a very high quality of assembly, rivalling that of the classic genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. This study highlighted the importance of the interaction between D. innubila and its viruses as implied by patterns of immune evolution in antiviral genes. Notably, natural selection on the immunity and antiviral pathways in D. innubila differ markedly from D. melanogaster, implying divergent evolutionary pressures. The D. innubila DNA virus is similar to the D. melanogaster Kallithea virus. As such, comparisons between D. melanogaster and D. innubila and their viruses promise to inform on the nature of host-virus interactions. In some mushroom-feeding Drosophila species, such as D. guttifera and D. neotestacea, the antimicrobial peptide gene Diptericin B has been pseudogenized. However this gene is maintained in D. innubila, and is activated upon infection.

He was awarded the honor of Hero of the Kyrgyz Republic in 1997. Biography 2005 stamp honoring Sydykbekov Sydykbekov was born on 14 May 1912 in KenÕ°g-Suu, in the Issyk-Kul Region. His father died when he was three, and violence forced his family to seek refuge in the mountains when he was four. In 1918, the violence having subsided, his family returned but found their old way of life destroyed; his mother had to take a position with a farmer in Karakol. While they lived in poverty, Sydykbekov was able to get a Soviet education, which would serve him well in his writing career. In the 1920s, before the collectivization of the country, he was able to study veterinary medicine in Bishkek, an extraordinary opportunity for him as the child of an impoverished day laborer. When the country was collectivized, he was at university, but had contracted tuberculosis and was forced to spend time recuperating in sanatoriums on the lake and in Georgia. In his early stories he sang the praises of collectivization, which for many poor laborers (including his family) was a protection against oppression by landowners and other groups in power, a situation he knew very well. Sydykbekov became known as one of the first Kyrgyz writers of prose, and he began by publishing uncontroversial texts. He wrote what has been called \\"the first Kyrgyz novel\\", Keng-Suu (1937‚Äì38, \\"Broad River\\", named for and set in the village that was the place of his birth). His best-known work is his third novel, Bizdin zamandyn ki≈°ileri (\\"People of our time\\"), written during and right after World War II. Less successful as a novel, it is noteworthy for its description of the encounter between intellectuals and Islam. During the war, Sydykbekov traveled throughout the region in order to describe daily life as accurately as possible, and in his novel sang the praises of the Kyrgyz population, who showed hospitality toward everyone, including widowed Russian women and orphaned Ukrainian children. Aaly Tokombaev, among others, criticized the novel, whose main character, he said, relied all too easily on God and brought religious faith on an equal plane with socialism; he would not accept that this character was realistic at all: Sydykbekov, in effect, defied the tenets of socialist realism. Still, the novel won the Stalin Prize, 3rd class in 1949. Possibly, according to a recent historian, it was the result of a post-war effort to turn toward traditional culture (which included Islam in Kyrgyzstan), an effort that was appreciated in Sydykbekov's novel, since it simultaneously showed that the author identified with the Soviet Union. In the debate over the Epic of Manas, whose status in the USSR of the early 1950s was controversial (the poem was condemned by Stalin's \\"propagandist in chief\\" Andrei Zhdanov as an example of \\"bourgeois cosmopolitanism\\"), Sydykbekov supported the poem, which, in a drastic shift, by 1952 was called anti-Soviet and anti-Chinese and condemned as pan-Islamic. In 1968, he was honored as People's Writer of the Kyrgyz Soviet Republic.

He was a founding academician of both the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He was the founder of the Changchun Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Changchun University of Science and Technology, and the Chinese Optical Society.  Early life and education  Wang was born on 26 February 1915 in Tokyo, Japan, with his ancestral home in Suzhou, China. His father Wang Yingwei (ÁéãÂ∫î‰ºü) was an astronomer then studying in Japan. Wang graduated from the Department of Physics at Tsinghua University in 1936. In 1938, he won the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study in England. After earning his master's degree from Imperial College London in 1940, he began his doctoral studies at the University of Sheffield in optical physics and technology.  Career  = United Kingdom = After World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany, a major maker of optical glass, banned the export of the strategic product. The British government offered support for domestic companies to develop and manufacture the product, and Wang decided to abandon his studies and join Chance Brothers, a leading British glass manufacturer. His research at the company led to the development of new types of optical glass and precision instruments. = China = In 1948, Wang returned to China and established the Department of Applied Physics at the former Dalian University (now part of the Dalian University of Technology). In 1952, Wang established the Changchun Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (originally named the Institute of Instrumentation) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun. He is also considered the founder of Changchun University of Science and Technology, a spinoff of the institute. He worked at the institute from 1952 to 1983, and served several times as its president. At the institute, he made a number of inventions and developed China's first electronic microscope and laser. Under his leadership, the Changchun Institute played a crucial role in the development of strategic weapons, developing high-precision optics for missile guidance systems. It enabled major breakthroughs for China's submarine- launched ballistic missile program. Wang was elected a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1955. In 1992, he and five other scientists advocated the creation of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) independent from the CAS. When the Chinese government accepted their proposal and established the CAE in 1994, Wang was again elected as a founding academician and a member of the presidium. He was a fellow of SPIE and chaired a number of SPIE symposiums and conferences. In March 1986, Wang Daheng and three other prominent scientists‚ÄîWang Ganchang, Yang Jiachi, and Chen Fangyun‚Äîwrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping advocating the development of strategic technologies. Deng accepted their proposal, which gave birth to the influential 863 Program, named after the date of their letter. Wang died on 21 July 2011 in Beijing, at the age of 96. He was buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. Honours and recognition Wang was awarded the Two Bombs, One Satellite Meritorious Medal in 1999 for his role in developing the technology to trigger nuclear fusion using laser. He was also conferred the Special Prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award and the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize for Achievement in Science and Technology.

The freighter spent the majority of her career in the Pacific connecting the West Coast of the United States with the Chinese and Japanese ports in the Far East. Early in 1928 the ship together with six other vessels was sold by the US Government to the Tacoma Oriental Steamship Co. and subsequently renamed Seattle. After her owner declared bankruptcy early in 1937, the ship was sold to Matson Navigation and renamed Lihue and was then mainly employed to transport sugar and canned fruit from the Hawaiian Islands to the ports on the United States East coast. In February 1942 she was chartered to transport general cargo and war supplies to the Middle East but was torpedoed by U-161 in the Caribbean Sea on February 23, and eventually sank three days later while in tow without loss of life. Design and construction After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1079 cargo ship was a modified Design 1013 standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,600 tons deadweight designed by Skinner & Eddy and adopted by USSB. Wheatland Montana was part of the order for 47 vessels placed by USSB with Skinner & Eddy on 1 June 1918 and was laid down on 26 March 1919 and launched on 4 August 1919 (yard number 54), with Miss Juanita Cook of Judith Gap, Montana being the sponsor. The vessel was named in honor of town of Wheatland in Montana whose residents finished first in their district in subscription for the Liberty Loan. The ship was of a three-deck type, had five main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five main hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. The vessel had electric lights installed along the decks and was also equipped with wireless. After successfully completing her six hour long trial trip on August 30, Wheatland Montana was handed over to the USSB on the same day, and officially commissioned on September 3. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Wheatland Montana was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,962. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 359 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel. Operational history Following delivery to USSB the ship was immediately handed over to Pacific Mail Steamship Co. to operate on the West Coast of the United States to the Orient route. After loading 9,000 tons cargo consisting mainly of auto trucks, cotton and various metal products, the ship sailed from Seattle for the Orient on September 23, 1919. After visiting ports of Japan, China and Philippines the steamer returned to Seattle on December 21 thus successfully completing her maiden voyage. The freighter continued sailing between the North Pacific ports of the United States and the ports in Japan, China and the Philippines initially as part of the Admiral Line, and later American Oriental Mail Line, through the early part of 1928. On her westward trips the ship carried mostly lumber, but also grain, flour, herring and metal products while on her return journeys she would transport sugar, copra, hemp, mahogany, peanuts, various vegetable oils and other oriental merchandise. For example, in early January 1921 the freighter took on board 1,750,000 feet of lumber from Dollar Mills in Vancouver and 250 tons of general cargo before sailing for the Orient. On one of her return trips, she brought back about 5,000 tons of hemp from Manila and other cargo to Seattle and Vancouver. During her career Wheatland Montana came to other vessels help on several occasions. In early January 1924 when Admiral Line's steamer SS Harold Dollar steering gear got jammed by a shifted deckload of lumber, Wheatland Montana rushed to aid and stood by until the problem was resolved and the freighter could safely proceed to her destination. In February 1925 when SS Patrick Henry went aground on shoals off Wada, Wheatland Montana came to her aid and pulled the steamer off. On April 1, 1926 while on her way from Tsingtao to Puget Sound ports with a large cargo of hemp, peanuts and mahogany logs, Wheatland Montana lost her propeller and rudder post, and was drifting helplessly in stormy weather. Two days later another Admiral Line steamer, , came to her aid and took the disabled freighter in tow. As the weather got worse the tow line separated and the ships had to wait out until the wind died down. After about two weeks of towing and about 700 miles from the Puget Sound, West Niger was relieved by yet another Admiral Oriental Line steamer, SS City of Spokane who brought the disabled freighter safely to port on April 24. On February 10, 1928 it was announced that USSB decided to get out of shipping business and accepted bids for the three Pacific Lines they were operating at the time. On February 16 it was announced USSB disposed of all three lines including the American Oriental Mail Line. The line was sold together with seven ships it operated for 696,906 to a new concern, Tacoma Oriental Steamship Co., formed by local Tacoma businessmen and headed by John Sherman Baker. Wheatland Montana was one of the vessels sold, and her price tag was set at 104,601. Following the acquisition, the new owner decided to rename all vessels in honor of Washington ports, with Wheatland Montana slated to become Seattle. At the time of acquisition, the ship was still chartered for one more trip to the Far East, and therefore continued to operate temporarily under her old name and USSB control. On May 12 it was reported that the freighter called into Tientsin with a cracked tunnel shaft, and was forced to proceed to Dairen for temporary repairs. On her return trip, Wheatland Montana again developed problems with her rudder and had to be taken into tow by steamer SS West Nomentum. Approximately 700 miles from the Puget Sound West Nomentum was forced to pause due to her fuel running low, and both ships had to await the arrival of the US Coast Guard cutter which safely brought the disabled steamer into port. After completion of repairs, the ship was officially rechristened Seattle on August 2, 1928 in the presence of a large crowd, and after loading full cargo of lumber and general merchandise departed for her first voyage under new name and ownership for Dairen on August 6. Under new ownership, Seattle continued sailing on the same routes as previously carrying cargo between the ports of the Pacific Northwest and China and Japan. In this role Tacoma Oriental Line came into direct competition with American Mail Line, a subsidiary of Dollar Steamship Company, who after several attempts managed to acquire in December 1931 John S. Baker's controlling interest in Tacoma-based company. Tacoma Steamship Company continued to operate as an independent entity through 1937 between the same ports in the United States and Canadian Northwest and respective destinations in China, Japan and Philippines. In the fall 1932 Seattle and the rest of Tacoma-based vessels were put on the twin- shuttle route taking them to California ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco in addition to their regularly served destinations. In February 1935 Seattle ran aground on Turia Rock while on her way from Manila to Cebu. The ship suffered little damage and was lifted off with the aid of tugs and was able to proceed to her destination. The company finally became profitable in 1933, however, a series of labor disputes in 1934-1935, including a 1934 maritime strike which tied the company's vessels for many months, expiration and non- renewal of the government mail subsidy for the 1936 season, forced the company to default on their debt and file for reorganization early in 1936. The vessels belonging to Tacoma Oriental were chartered out short term to other companies, with Seattle being taken over by her parent company, Dollar Steamship. In April 1936 due to increase in traffic Seattle was used by Dollar for one trip to transport a large cargo of cotton, scrap tin, used rails and other general merchandise from California to Japan. The ship was subsequently put on Dollar's Guam service, but only remained in it until the end of 1936. In September 1936 Tacoma Oriental Line sold two vessels to Waterman Steamship Co., and attempted to re-enter business with five remaining vessels, including Seattle, but the bid proved to be unsuccessful due to yet another labor strike, and the company was finally liquidated by court order in February 1937 with all five vessels being sold to Matson Navigation Company. After court approved acquisition of the vessels, Matson Navigation Co. renamed them after their affiliated sugar plantations in the Hawaiian Islands, with Seattle becoming Lihue. Lihue departed San Francisco under her new name and new ownership on March 17, 1937 for Honolulu. After loading a cargo consisting of 7,385 tons of sugar and canned pineapples, the ship departed Hawaii on April 10 for East coast ports of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, passed through the Panama Canal on May 5 and reached her destination on May 20. On her return voyage the freighter departed Baltimore on May 31 loaded with 5,180 tons of cargo consisting of steel and general merchandise, and reached Honolulu on July 3. Lihue continued sailing on West to East coast routes between the ports of Hawaii, California and Pacific Northwest and Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia through the end of her career carrying sugar and canned fruit on her eastward journeys, and steel products and general merchandise when sailing westward. The freighter was occasionally used on other routes, for example, she sailed from the Pacific Northwest ports to Liverpool in November 1937 carrying 8,024 tons of cargo consisting of wheat, lumber and fish. =Sinking= With the United States entry into the Second World War in December 1941 many ships were requisitioned by the United States government and put under control of the War Shipping Administration (WSA). Lihue was chartered for one trip to Alexandria to deliver general cargo and war mat√©riel to the British troops fighting in North Africa. After loading her cargo the ship sailed from New York in mid-February 1942 bound for Trinidad where the freighter was scheduled to bunker before proceeding to her next stop at Capetown. The vessel was under command of captain W. G. Leithead and had a crew of eight officers and twenty-eight men in addition to nine Navy gunners. At approximately 23:34 local time on February 22, 1942 Lihue was spotted by a lookout from German submarine (captain Achilles) approximately 275 miles west of Martinique moving at approximately . At 00:43 on February 23 a torpedo was launched by the submarine and after 126 seconds the ship was struck on her port side just forward of #1 hold. The steamer started to take on water immediately but was able to continue on her course and maintain her speed. About fifteen minutes later seeing that the freighter does not sink, U-161 opened fire with her deck gun but the steamer's gun crew returned fire with both her main guns and machine guns forcing the submarine to crash dive. U-161 continued shadowing the steamer for the next four hours trying to deliver coup de gr√¢ce but due to the freighter's zig-zagging the U-boat could never get into a good attack position. At approximately 09:45 Lihue changed course and headed for St. Lucia. At 12:39 U-161 fired another torpedo at the vessel from approximately 600 meters but the ship again changed course avoiding being hit. At about the same time captain Leithead ordered the crew to abandon ship. The crew and the gunners disembarked the ship in two lifeboats and three rafts, and shortly after U-161 fired two more torpedoes from approximately 900 meters, only to see them miss the vessel again. The submarine stayed in the area for four more hours but due to arrival of patrol aircraft and commander Achilles's belief that the vessel was a Q-ship the submarine broke off the pursuit and left the area. The crew of Lihue was soon taken aboard the British tanker SS British Governor and landed safely in Trinidad next day. A salvage crew from the Canadian armed merchant cruiser boarded abandoned Lihue and the freighter was taken into tow by the US minesweeper , however, due to significant amount of damage sustained by the freighter during and after the attack the vessel sank on February 26 while in tow not far from St. Lucia.

He published in 1819 a Hebrew translation of the Apocryphal additions to the Book of Esther, under the title Hosafah li- Megillat Ester, with a literary-historical introduction. At the same time he became known as an eloquent maggid. Many of his sermons were published, among them his funeral oration on the death of , under the title Zekher Tzaddik li- Brakhah (1821). Through his sermons and his close association with Rabbi Akiva Eger, Plessner became known as a defender of Orthodox Judaism against the growing Reform movement. Forbidden by the police from delivering sermons, he in 1823 settled in Festenberg, Silesia. He presented a defense of the Talmud to the Posen government in 1826, prompting the government to revoke a decree forbidding Talmudic instruction in schools. Pressner moved to Berlin in 1830, where he earned a livelihood by lecturing in the Berlin beit midrash. In 1832 his Nozelim min Lebanon was published, consisting of a Hebrew translation of a part of the Apocrypha, with an appendix, entitled Duda'im, containing exegetical notes, verses in Hebrew and German, and sermons. The following year he was invited to dedicate the new synagogue at Bromberg, for which occasion he composed poems in Hebrew and in German, which were published under the title Shirim la-·∏§anukkat Bet ha-Tefillah (1834).

In 84 AD, Youliu attempted to negotiate trade with the Administrator of Wuwei Commandery, but the Southern Xiongnu plundered and kidnapped the traders. In 85 AD, Youliu threatened to resume raids on Han territory. As appeasement, the Han ordered the Southern Xiongnu to ransom prisoners taken from the north. However this only strengthened the Southern Xiongnu as it rewarded them for attacking northern trade caravans. In 87 AD, the Xianbei attacked Youliu and killed him. They stripped the skin off of him and his followers and took the skin back with them as trophies. The Northern Xiongnu court fell into chaos and two contenders for the title of chanyu appeared.

It was designed before the First world war and was used in both the First and Second world wars. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of WWI, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period could not carry large bombs, the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers; while large-caliber naval guns were common, large-caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity and lack of mobility. Large-caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be disassembled into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or traction engines and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembly, transport and reassembly, but did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution, because the problems of weight, mobility and setup time were addressed. = World War I = It is believed two mortars were used during the initial French operations to retake Fort Douaumont during the Battle of Verdun, attracting four mortars for the final assault. The projectiles may not have been powerful enough to penetrate the roof of the fort. They also participated in the Somme Offensive and four were used in the Champagne region between August 1915-Feb 1916. Two were used during the Battle of Hartmannswillerkopf during 1915‚Äì1916. = World War II = The mortars were placed in reserve between the wars and in April 1940, four were mobilized. A fifth piece was taken from the reserve to be placed on an experimental tracked chassis for a planned attack on the Siegfried line during 1941.  Design  The MLE was designed between 1908 and 1912 by French artillery officer Louis Filloux. The barrels were converted from surplus naval guns that were shortened and bored out to . The guns were typical built-up guns with layers of steel reinforcing hoops. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. During loading the barrel was lowered 6¬∞ and a shell was brought forward by a cart that ran on a rail to the breech of the mortar. A crane was used to lift projectiles onto the cart. Ten mortars and two spare barrels were ordered in November 1914 and built under the designer's supervision. Deliveries began in May 1915 and continued until January 1916. = Coastal artillery = Although intended to be a coastal defense mortar, it is unlikely that any MLE 1914's were deployed in that role. In the coastal artillery role, the MLE 1914 was intended to pierce the decks of armored warships with high angle plunging fire, rather than piercing their side armored belt. In this role, they would have been used in groups to defend navigation channels into ports. The carriage was of simple construction and was made from steel beams that were welded together to form a box with a large hollow center section to allow high angles of elevation. The recoil system consisted of a U shaped gun cradle that held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with hydraulic buffers on each side. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the rear of the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. This style of mount is referred to as a garrison mount and was common for coastal artillery. Normally this type of mount stood behind a cement slab behind a parapet as part of coastal fortifications and they weren't designed to be mobile. What isn't clear is what type of traverse the carriage would have had. = Siege artillery = For transport, the mle 1914 could be placed on convertible gauge rail bogies which allowed the mortar to be moved long distances over standard-gauge rails and narrow-gauge rails for the last leg of the journey from the rail station to its firing positihave on. These narrow gauge tracks were also used to re- position the mortars and bring up their ammunition and supplies. Later in the war road wheels which allowed the mortars to be towed by a traction engine were developed. The mortar was transported in 3 loads: The barrel, the carriage, and the firing platform. Each part was transported on a gantry crane which was suspended between two double-axle narrow gauge bogies. The most time-consuming part of the site preparation included the excavation of a large pit into which the steel firing platform was sunk. The mortar was then assembled by the gantry cranes which ran on two parallel 60 cm gauge tracks laid apart, perpendicular to the line of fire on each side of the pit. First, the firing platform was lowered into the pit and anchored. This platform had several pilings that were sunk into the ground to absorb some of the mortar's recoil forces. Second, the carriage was brought in and lowered onto and fastened to the base. Lastly, the barrel was lowered onto the carriage. The construction of each part was one simple operation.  Ammunition  The mortars fired separate loading bagged charges that weighed up to and projectiles that weighed between . As the war progressed heavier projectiles were manufactured including armor-piercing and high explosive.

The Royal Navy acquired Gibraltar in 1779 and in May commissioned her under Lieutenant Almerick Brown. The Spanish captured her in the Mediterranean in 1781 and named her San Salvador. Loss On 18 April 1781 Lieutenant Walter Anderson was sailing from Gibraltar to Minorca with dispatches. When Gibraltar was about 36 miles SSW of Cape Gata she sighted two Spanish xebecs. Gibraltar sailed away, with the xebecs in pursuit. After about four hours one had come up within about 50 yards and an engagement ensued. The Spaniard was able to take a position under Gibraltars lee quarter and to rake her from there. Anderson then struck. Gibraltars captor was the 34-gun Murciano.Murciano (which also carried the religious name of San Fulgencio), was a 467-ton (burthen) xebec launched on 30 January 1779, the first of three sisters (the others being Valenciano and Catal√°n), ordered on 16 May 1778 and all launched at Cartagena during 1779; she measured 150 pies in length (the Spanish pie was 278.6 mm, about 91.4% of an English foot), 39 pies in breadth, and 14¬Ω pies in depth of hold. She carried twenty-two 8-pounder guns in her main battery, ten 6-pounders on the quarterdeck, and two 6-pounders on her forecastle. Spanish career The Spanish renamed Gibraltar San Salvador. She may have participated in the Spanish attack on Gibraltar on 13‚Äì14 September 1782.American War of Independence at Sea; accessed 13 June 2020. By some accounts recaptured her on 29 July 1800. This report appears to be in error. On 29 June Anson and captured two privateer misticos: Gibraltar and Severo (or Severino). Gibraltar was armed with four guns and had a crew of 50 men. Severo was armed with two guns and ten swivel guns, and had a crew of 26 men. On 30 June Anson cut off two Spanish gun boats, Gibraltar and Salvador, that had been annoying the convoy she was escorting. They each mounted two 18‚Äìpounder guns in their bow, and each had eight guns of different dimensions on their sides. They were each manned by 60 men and probably sustained heavy casualties in resisting Anson. A later prize money notice suggests that the captures on 29 and 30 June are actually the same, and refer to the gunboats Cervero and Trois Hermanos.

Evans edited and published the progressive weekly newspaper for 32 years, to provide a voice for Austin activists, free of distortion by mainstream media. His civil-rights activism included a broad range of causes and was not limited to issues of race.  Personal life  Evans was born Larry Elvis Dale in Dayton, Ohio. He grew up in Kentucky, attending an all-black school before desegregation. He relocated from Lexington to Austin in 80's, became involved in civil-rights activism and changed his name to Akwasi Rozelle Evans. As a father, Akwasi encouraged his daughter Sherilyn Scott-Blackburn to pursue her love of singing. She performed under her stage name, Sheri Mogul, at his memorial in Austin on June 16, 2019. Evans was also a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.  Journalist  Evans became a beat reporter for The Villager newspaper. Through his contributions, Evans became a crucial part of East Austin's political progressive infrastructure. Tommy Wyatt, editor of The Villager newspaper called Evans \\"a tireless warrior for East Austin, who would spare nothing\\" in support of his community. Evans also wrote for the Austin American Statesman for a year and worked as a freelance reporter for the Daily Worker in the 70s and 80s. Evans briefly supported the Communist because he admired them for standing up for The Scottsboro Boys, the African American teenagers, falsely accused of rape in 1931. However, when he saw the racism within the party he realized communism was a failed system and withdrew his support. In Austin Evans led the Austin anti-apartheid movement and also worked on a broad range of civil-rights movements, including CISPES on Central America, the Lebanon movement, and ADAPT, the disability rights organization. He was leading organizer of the first MLK Jr. marchers in Austin. Other civil-rights causes Evans supported included NARAL and TARAL. In 1995 Evans participated in the Million Man March in Washington, D. C. with Tommy Wyatt, founder of Austin's The Villager newspaper. During his last decade Evans opposed the gentrification of East Austin.  NOKOA: The Observer  Evans left The Villager in August 1987 and started his own newspaper, NOKOA: The Observer. He felt that the mainstream media distorted what activist did. He also saw that the black media wouldn't cover the activist's work. He believed that the community of activist in Austin did not have a voice and he was determined to create a progressive paper to serve these activist who fought for civil rights, justice, and opposed discrimination. He also wanted the paper to be an Afrocentric Newspaper, and not simply a black newspaper. He published and edited the progressive weekly newspaper until his death. NOKOA: The Observer covered police misconduct and community empowerment. It provided a place for social justice in local Austin media. The paper gave a voice to Central Texas' political activists who were challenging the laws and customs that oppressed people because of \\"their skin color, religion, sexual choice, gender identity, age, size or income,\\" said Nelson Linder, the president of the Austin chapter of the NAACP. Evans was a member of the Texas Publishers Association and the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA). For 32 years the NOKOA: The Observer provided the Austin community with valuable information and vital public service announcements.  Radio show  After returning from the Million Man March in 1995, Evans and Tommy Wyatt teamed-up with co-host Damita Shanklin, to form \\"The Breakfast Club\\" on KAZI 88.7 FM radio. The conversational show aired Friday morning at 8 am and the hosts shared different points of view on issues, not always agreeing, but never falling out over their differences.  Editorial on Zimmerman decision  Evans wrote an editorial, \\"A 21st Century Dred Scott Decision\\" in response to George Zimmerman being found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin. In July 2013, the Texas Observer published his editorial. In it Evans decried the decision in the Zimmerman case and compared it to the 1857 Dred Scott Decision, which held that the constitution was not meant to include citizenship for black people.

The coalition became infamous for their sheer power and strength in taking over and dominating an area of approximately . It is believed the Mapogos killed in excess of 100 lions and cubs in a little over a year. The statistics may be higher given their coverage of such large territories. At its peak, the coalition consisted of six males - the leader Makulu (also spelled as Makhulu),https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/makulu Rasta, Scar, Pretty Boy, Kinky Tail and Mr. T.  History  The Mapogo coalition originated from Mala Mala from what was called the ‚ÄúEyrefield Pride‚Äù (Sparta Pride) and moved into the Western Sector in 2006. The Mapogo lions followed a recent trend in the Sabi Sand Reserve of mega pride male lion coalitions. The five related brothers were sired by a similar mega pride coalition of five male lions. In their quest to dominate the area, the six lions killed approximately 40 other lions which included many cubs, females, and rival adult males. The oldest Mapogo male, Makulu, is believed to be unrelated to the other five lions. The story is that the original Sparta pride lost a male sub-adult of 20 to 21 months of age in May/June 2000 and in July 2000, this male of about the same age latched on to the original pride. As a result, Makulu was naturally bigger in size than his fellow brothers. Though not readily accepted by the lionesses, the West Street Males tolerated him and didn't kill him, even though typically, intruding males of his age would be chased off or killed. Field experts believe a likely reason for his acceptance into the pride was because he may have been the offspring of one of the West Street Males and a lioness from another pride (therefore making him the Mapogos' half brother). In the first months of 2006, the five subadult lions and Makulu left their pride. They now had to fight for themselves, but by sticking together they increased their survival chances. Whilst living among themselves, the lions learned to be successful hunters. As they grew in size and experience, they were able to take down large prey such as hippos, young rhinos, and even giraffes. According to Dave Salmoni, successfully taking down cape buffalo was their \\"key to success\\". During the buffalo hunts, Kinky Tail (also called Shaka) and Mr. T (also called Satan) were often observed being more aggressive in bringing down the buffalo. =Rise of the Mapogo coalition= The Mapogos first pride clash was in 2006. The Mapogo lions entered the northern Sabi Sand, which was ruled by four dominant males. Immediately upon arrival, the Mapogos managed to kill one of the males, and the remaining three were driven off. With the Ottawa pride's male lion driven off, three lionesses and 11 cubs remained. Due to the male lion's natural instincts, the six Mapogos quickly found and killed all 11 Ottawa cubs, with reports of Mr. T even eating some of the cubs, despite cannibalistic behavior in lions being uncommon. With all competition eliminated, the Mapogos had successfully controlled eight prides. They were the dominant male coalition of Sabi Sand and killed more than 100 lions from the neighbouring prides during their rule. =Split in the Mapogo coalition= Despite ruling a large territory, the Mapogo coalition wasn't functioning smoothly due to internal rivalry. Many fights often broke out with the leader Makulu and Mr. T. A closely contested clash then happened with Mr. T and Makulu, in which Makulu managed to grab and bite Mr. T's legs and win the encounter. After this fight, it was observed that Mr. T and Kinky Tail broke off from their four brothers, and headed east to control the northern part of the territory. Mr. T and Kinky Tail were then seen patrolling and guarding their territory for two years, managing to fight off other rival lions. However, in June 2010, a coalition of five male lions named the Majingilanes entered in Mapogo territory to take over. The five males were witnessed scent-marking and roaring loudly near the Mapogo's territory. In a buffalo hunt, Kinky Tail and Mr. T were able to isolate the leader of Majingilane males who was on lookout and began chasing him. Soon they caught the intruder and Mr. T bit down on the male's neck, Kinky Tail ripped apart the male's groin area inflicting tears and bleeding. The Majingilane male tried to fight back. Eventually Kinky Tail and Mr. T managed to break the 5th Majingilane lion's spine and he was left immobilized and left to die a few hours later. = Kinky Tail's death = Later that same night, a filming crew witnessed the four remaining younger Majingilane lions on the move. Two of them were exposed to Kinky Tail, who immediately charged on them all by himself. They ran with KT on their tail, and the remaining two Majingilane lions came up behind KT. Without the experience of being afraid of anything, the now-aging Kinky Tail attacked all four of them by himself. Eventually on a dirt road, under a cloud of dust, the 4 Majingilanes had pinned down Kinky Tail. The four males immediately started to bite and rip apart Kinky Tail. One lion was biting at his neck, another at his back; the third bit off Kinky Tail's testicles and genitalia. The Majingilanes managed to successfully snap Kinky Tail's spine, thus immobilizing him and leaving him with zero chance of survival. Mr. T eventually arrived and attempted to rescue and fight off the Majingilanes, but was outnumbered and outmaneuvered and forced to flee. Two Majingilanes attempted to track Mr. T, but were unsuccessful and returned to kill Kinky Tail. The four lions had started eating most of Kinky Tail's hind legs and his entire tail. He was seen taking his last breath while being eaten alive. During the altercation, Mr. T attempted again to save his brother. However, still injured from the previous encounter, his attempt was to no avail, and he again fled. Majingilane lions took over the territory and the pride of the two defeated lions and likely killed all their cubs. =Reunion of Mr. T with 4 Mapogo lions= After Kinky Tail's death, Mr. T was driven off his territory and headed back west to rejoin his former coalition with Makulu, Rasta, Pretty Boy and Dreadlocks. Mr. T managed to rejoin and peacefully coexist with his fellow brothers in their territory. However, soon after Mr. T was observed seeking out, killing and eating his brothers' cubs. His brothers did nothing to stop this. Mr. T had been taking over the pride of his brothers, and the cubs were standing in his way. This was also done in an attempt to mate with the females and spread his own lineage. Mr. T had taken over as the leader of the Mapogo coalition. During the next two years, Rasta (also called Leonides) was probably killed by poachers and Dreadlocks was shot by local people when he left the reserve. The Mapogo coalition was reduced to three members; Makhulu (14 years), Pretty Boy, and Mr. T. (12 years). = Mr. T's death = On March 16, 2012, another coalition of four male lions called the Selatis entered Mapogo territory from the south. The four Selatis were able to single out one of the Mapogos who turned out to be Mr. T. By the time wildlife officials and film crew arrived, Mr. T had already been attacked and had several bite wounds on his back and front shoulder. One of the bites near the back was a deep bite. Mr. T was paralyzed from the hip down from the attack and made him vulnerable from all four lions coming in for the attack. The tactic used by the Selatis was to distract Mr. T from one side, and another lion would bite and maul Mr. T from behind on the spine and genitalia. The Selatis would then stop and move away temporarily from attacking, they would then get back up and proceed with attacking Mr. T, this process was repeated several times. Eventually, the Selatis left the severely injured and paralyzed Mr. T, who died that evening. Following Mr. T's death, the last remaining Mapogos, Makulu and Pretty Boy, fought a coalition of two Kruger males and were driven off their territory. They were sighted in 2012 side by side, entering the Kruger National Park through the gate attributed to Paul Kruger. The remaining two were once again seen feeding on a buffalo in October‚ÄìNovember 2012. In January 2013, Makulu was seen for the last time alone at Mala Mala, neighboring his old haunt, the Sabi Sand Reserve. At this point, he was almost 15 years old and largely exceeded the average male lion life expectancy.  In film  Daniel Huertas directed the documentary Brothers in Blood: The Lions of Sabi Sand, which was released in 2015 in the UK. The documentary summarized the 16-year span of the rise and eventual fall of the Mapogo coalition. The documentary aired as an 8-episode series in the United States on Animal Planet.

Features  The Rock Garden contains miniature versions of several famous structures, including the following: * The cathedral of Notre Dame, complete with stained glass windows * The Japanese Himeji Castle * The Colosseum In between the villages and structures are narrow cobblestone paths and bridges that people can walk on. Each autumn, the Garden hosts an annual lighting ceremony where the castles and other miniature buildings are lit by candlelight. Boyd's wife, Joyce Maples, also works on the Garden and is responsible for the Memory Wall with clay hearts for each marriage ceremony that has taken place in the Garden. As of 2016, 16 wedding ceremonies had taken place in the Garden, including one between Boyd and Joyce.

It is expected to replace the current R62 and R62A rolling stock, which are used on the subway's A Division and were built in the mid-1980s.  Component orders  The R262 order is divided into a base order and two option orders. The base order consists of 504 cars, the first option order consists of 445 cars, and the second option order has up to 415 cars. The subway car order will entirely replace the R62 and R62A fleets, and the second option order will include up to 225 cars to support ridership growth and other operational needs. The R262 order will consist of cars in 5-car sets for the mainline IRT and 6-car sets for the 42nd Street Shuttle. The base order and first option order (949 cars) will be funded in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s 2020-2024 Capital Program, while the second option order (up to 415 cars) will be funded in the future 2025‚Äì2029 Capital Program.  Features  Alternate R262 interior rendering The design of the R262 subway cars are based on the specifications of the R211T cars, which are being built for the B Division. They will have modern signage and communication, an ethernet network, updated crash energy management standards, and open-gangways that allow passengers to move between cars during train movement and increase train capacity. In addition, they will be equipped with communications-based train control (CBTC). Unlike the R211s, R262s will have additional audio induction loops for riders with hearing impairments. Like the R211s, the subway cars will have a blue front with large windows, LED headlights, and a blue strip with gold accents on the sides, similar to the new MTA Regional Bus Operations livery released in 2016. To designate the route, a large LED screen with the route bullet will be displayed at the ends of the train similar to trains with single rollsigns (R40 to R68); also, the route's destination will be displayed above the door on the front.  History  On January 22, 2019, the MTA announced that it would order a fleet of approximately 1,500 subway cars in future capital programs so the agency could accelerate its plans to install CBTC on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line as part of the Fast Forward Plan. Since the 1,139 R62 and R62A subway cars do not have the necessary equipment and network infrastructure to become CBTC-equipped, the agency decided to order a new fleet of CBTC-equipped cars to outright replace them instead. On September 16, 2019, the MTA released its 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program, which included funding to purchase approximately 900 A Division subway cars, with $1.5 billion to provided for a base order, and $1.4 billion for an option to purchase additional A Division cars. The document also stated that the production of additional A Division subway cars would be part of the future 2025‚Äì2029 Capital Program. In January 2020, the New York City Transit (NYCT) sent a request to the MTA Board, asking for permission to forgo competitive bidding for the contract and issue a request for proposals (RFP) for the order, which would now consist of 1,364 cars with all options exercised, instead of approximately 1,500 cars. In addition, NYCT asked the Board to approve a modification to the agency's contract with CH2M Hill New York for consulting services for the R211 subway car order, extending its term by a year so consulting services for the R262 order could be completed as under the same contract. In late February 2020, the MTA issued the RFP, with plans to award the contract in early 2021.

It is notable for its low price, starting at less than $8,700 after incentives. Overview The car is manufacured in a facility in Shiyan, Hubei owned by eGT New Energy Automotive, a joint venture between Dongfeng, Renault and Nissan. It is related to the low-cost, ICE-powered Renault Kwid which is sold in India and Brazil. It utilizes a variant of Renault-Nissan's CMF platform named CMF-A. Sales in China started in 2019, and the vehicle is not currently sold in other markets. In October 2019, Gilles Normand, head of the EV department in Renault, indicated that a version for Europe was in the works. This version was revealed as Dacia Spring in March 2020, during an online event (because of the cancellation of the 2020 Geneva Motor Show). Specifications Renault City K-ZE rear view The vehicle uses a 26.8 kWh lithium ion battery and is powered by a , front-mounted electric motor driving the front wheels. DC fast charging from 0% to 80% takes 50 minutes. The EPA range is not given and can be estimated at around ; this is based on the car's NEDC range and the ratio of the EPA range to the NEDC range available for another BEV city car, the Smart EQ Fortwo. While the car is rated at in China, this is based on the NEDC cycle, no longer in use in Europe as it gives wildly inaccurate results, especially for EVs. Optional equipment includes an infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen, a backup camera and manual air conditioning. A smartphone app allows remote monitoring of the vehicle's status. Pricing and reception With the price starting at 61,800 yuan ($8,650) after incentives, this electric car is very cheap by Western standards. The car represents a category of budget electric city cars popular in China, but practically nonexistent in the West; among these, it is probably the first one carrying a badge of a Western marque. Prices of EVs in general are much lower in China than in the US or Europe, and they exhibit a downward trend while in the West they show an upward trend: a report by JATO Dynamics shows that an all-electric car priced at $1 in 2011 would now cost $0.52 in China, but $1.42 in Europe and $1.55 in the US. The car was launched in China on September 10, 2019. The International Business Times wrote that it looks set to become the real \\"Tesla Killer\\" simply because of its low price, while erroneously stating it's the cheapest EV in the world (there are even cheaper EVs in China). Venucia e30 Venucia e30 Alongside the production version of the City K-ZE, Dongfeng Nissan showed off their version of an electric Kwid under the Venucia brand in the form of the e30. The e30 is essentially a badge engineered City K-ZE, sharing the same basic powertrain and design. The e30 name was previously used on another badged engineered EV based on the first generation Nissan Leaf.

Browne got a job dancing in the chorus but shortly afterwards got pregnant and had a son, which put a temporary stop to her dancing career. After the birth of her son, she resumed dancing as a soloist and as a member of the chorus in clubs around Chicago. During the 1950s, she toured with Cab Calloway's band. After she got a job in the chorus at a club in Greenwich Village, although she continued to tour, she settled in New York City. She began teaching at the Bronx Dance Theatre during the 1970s. She opened her own studio during the 1980s and founded the Aristaccato Tap Company. Browne specialized in sanding. She appeared on stage with performers such as Flip Wilson, Betty Carter, Dinah Washington, Della Reese, T-Bone Walker, Sister Sledge and The Pointer Sisters. She performed with tap dancers including Bunny Briggs, Charles Cook, James \\"Buster\\" Brown and The Silver Belles. She married Edward Browne during the 1970s. Browne died at the age of 65 in Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. In 2016, she was named to the International Tap Dance Hall of Fame.  Early Life  Browne was born on the south side of Chicago, Illinois to her parents Ruby and Reuben Jordan. Her entire immediate family was musically inclined as her mother was a hotel worker and amateur musician; her father was a pharmacist, shoe salesman, and self-taught dancer; and her elder sister, Marquita, was a singer. Browne's interest in dance stemmed from watching tap performances at Chicago's Regal Theater and from learning from her father who was a specialist in Snake Hips dancing. As a preteen, she started taking jazz and rhythm lessons from the Bruce Sisters. By the age of fifteen, she was performing in many of Chicago's nightclubs alongside her sister. This act, where her sister sang and Browne tap danced, was known as the Jordan Sisters. Browne also booked jobs alone in nightclubs such as Club DeLisa, NRA Theatre, and Robert's Show Club. Her ultimate goal was to become a chorus line dancer‚Äîa feat difficult for an African American to achieve. The daughter of Reuben Jordan, pharmacist and shoe salesman, and Ruby Jordan, hotel worker, she was born Harriet Jordan in Chicago. She was exposed to music and dance by her family from a young age and liked to listen to jazz. She dropped out of high school when she was fifteen to find employment as a dancer.  Career  In the early 1950s, Browne left Chicago to pursue chorus line dancing in New York City. As many nightclubs only hired white dancers, it was difficult for Browne to find consistent work. However, she did perform in the chorus lines at Club Savannah in Greenwich Village. Her tap choreography also earned her a place in various variety shows and nightclubs. Over the course of her career, she tapped alongside the Cab Calloway Band, Flip Wilson, Betty Carter, Dinah Washington, Della Reese, and T-bone Walker. She also had the opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall with Gregory Hines and Bunny Briggs. Browne took a 15-year break from dancing around the 1960s to mid-1970s. It wasn't until Barbara Klien, the artistic director of the Bronx Dance Theater, heard about Browne from a student that she encouraged Browne to take up dancing again. While working towards a certification from Dance Educators of America, Browne worked as a tap teacher at the Bronx Dance Theater. She devised the syllabus for the Theater's tap program. With this experience, she went on to form her own dance studio, the Aristaccato Tap Company in the early 1990s. The company focused on teaching jazz and tap dance to underprivileged youths in the Bronx. Browne also became the youngest member of The Silver Belles, an African American dance troupe based in Harlem, New York and made up of former chorus line dancers. One of Browne's most well-known pupils is Michelle Dorrance.  Sanding  Browne was well known for her incredibly fast, improvisational tap dancing on sand. By sprinkling a thin layer of sand over a wooden board, the rhythms of her tap shoes could be both \\"enhanced and softened.\\" Although she didn't invent the style, she became known as one of the best. Gregory Hines once called her ‚Äúthe world's greatest female sand dancer‚Äù. This is where her nickname, ‚ÄúQuicksand‚Äù, originated.  Death  Browne died on September 1, 1997 at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. Although her exact cause of death was not revealed, it is known that she suffered from muscle spasms and psoriasis for many years before her death.

At the end of 2015, according to a poll of 300, it was the second-largest traditional Reformed Church congregation in the country.  Background  The Gobabis Reformed Church was born of the migration of around 2,000 Angola-Afrikaners, descendants of the Dorsland Trek emigrants of the 1880s who mostly adhered to the GKSA and mostly returned to South West Africa (SWA) in 1929. From the establishment at the end of the nineteenth century of the Mariental Reformed Church (NGK) (as Gibeon, 1898) until 1930, the church council counted at most five congregations in SWA, all affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK). In 1930, three GKSA churches formed in rapid succession, including those in Gobabis, Outjo, and Aranos. The minority of Angola- Afrikaners in the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK) started their first three congregations in South West Africa in similar fashion in 1937: Gobabis (July 31), Otjiwarongo (August 21), and Grootfontein (September 4). The NGK did not arrive until after both of these foundations.  Foundation  In Kerk in 'n beter land: Die Kerkverhaal van die Dorsland- en Angolatrekkers 1873‚Äì1937, J.M. van Tonder (ed.) writes as follows about the Afrikaners' role in the founding of the settlement: \\"The Particular Synod of the Cape Reformed Church had, on May 26, 1930, delegated the Rev. H.S. van Jaarsveld to seek out members from Angola and South Africa and organize a church to guide them in the Word and the Sacrament. The Rev. Van Jaarsveld met with the elders Sarel du Plessis and E.T. Meyer and traveled to Farm 412, where a large group of parishioners awaited.\\" Prof. Dr. Jooste write in his Gedenkboek van die Dorstandtrek: > During the first week of June, the Rev. Van Jaarsveld concentrated on > testimonial catechism. On Saturday, June 6, 1930 (actually the next day), > the Gobabis congregation was founded (on the Auheib farm). The Rev. Van > Jaarseveld blessed the inauguration with the words of Ephesians 2:19-22: > 'Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow > citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the > foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the > chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to > become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built > together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.' On June 6, > 1930, all the church councilors of Angola gathered to approve the new > congregation. An emotional moment arose when the last minutes from a meeting > in Humpata, Angola, were read, approved, and signed by the council. Grounds > acquisition was discussed, and the Humpata church council agreed to stay > active until the foundation. A letter would also be sent to GKSA members in > Ghanzi, Botswana, to which Gobabis would be the nearest GKSA congregation. > On Saturday, June 7, 1930 (the Gobabis congregation's foundation date), the > Reformed Church members gathered at Helew 408 farm, near the house of P.C. > Akkerman, to pitch the tent. There were 364 confirmed and 462 baptized > members, altogether 826, in the new Gobabis S.W.A. Reformed Church. The Rev. > Van Jaarsveld, the chairman, explained to the congregation that the existing > Angola church council had been dissolved and a new one needed to be elected, > which it then was by secret ballot. The new councilors would be confirmed > during the dedication service. As in Angola, a cattle fund was established > to which people were expected to contribute to the best of their ability. The remains of the farm church still stand. In 1990, the members gathered there to commemorate the church's founding. The Helma farmhouse was partly built from the limestone cobblestones of the church.  Church building  The new congregation immediately set about acquiring church lands in the Gobabis area after leaving Portuguese Angola. The municipal government assured the church council that suitable lands would not be used for an airport (it is unclear why the church council would be concerned about such a possibility). Many factors contributed to the two-decade delay in construction, among them World War II. Finally, the renowned architect Gerard Moerdyk was hired to design the church, with P.J. van der Merwe hired as secretary of the building commission. Smit and Wagner was the firm contracted. Moerdyk suggested the same plan he had used for the Potchefstroom-Noord Reformed Church (later named the Potchefstroom-Die Bult Reformed Church), although the Potchefstroom building had different towers and was built entirely of brick. Moerdyk's blueprint included a Greek cross for the tower and seating for 400 churchgoers. The gallery, with seating for 125 people, symbolized outstretched arms embracing the community of believers. The tower was given a blunt point, since a pointed spire was considered too similar to a Roman Catholic church. Moerdyk proposed a cheaper wood for roofing; the floor was also not to be parqueted at first. The pews came later from Johannesburg, and the municipal government installed the lighting. The pulpit was made locally and acoustic plaster was omitted to save money. A member, J.C. Labuschagne, gifted the church bell. Construction began in April 1949, and the keystone was laid July 29, 1950. A member, Sannie Jansen van Vuuren, placed a bottle with a time capsule of documents under the keystone. On August 25, 1952, the congregation moved into the church it had been seeking since 1930. Elder P. Potgieter unlocked the door, elder H.P. du Plessis placed the Holy Bible on the lectern, and elder M. Van der Merwe placed the Psalter by its side. Van Vuuren was born September 14, 1867, as Susanna Catherina du Plessis in Grivelfontein, near Rustenburg, and died on July 7, 1952. Her father, Lourens Marthinus du Plessis, led the second Dorsland Trek. On September 27, 1885, she had married Christoffel Johannes Janse van Vuuren (22 December 1866 ‚Äì 1 December 1938) in Grootfontein. He had been born in Leeuwfontein, near Potchefstroom, and died on the Haring farm, near Gobabis. 12 children were born to this marriage. As the oldest member of the congregation, she was a natural choice to lay the aforementioned bottle with information on the congregation under its keystone. Gobabis had 305 confirmed members at the end of 1997, 274 at the end of 2001, and 211 at the end of 2012, but had rebounded to 242 at the end of 2014.

Best known for being the psychiatrist of Sylvia Plath, she corresponded with her since they met at McLean Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts following Plath's breakdown in 1953. Though Plath destroyed most of their letters, fourteen from Plath to Barnhouse remain (not including the two from Barnhouse to Plath in the Sylvia Plath papers at Smith College).  Early life  Barnhouse was born to American parents near Grenoble, France in 1923. The family moved to Philadelphia when she was two. Her father, Donald Grey Barnhouse, took up a teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania and was pastor of the Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia from 1927 to 1960 (see Wikipedia article). She was homeschooled by her grandmother Tiffany, whose late husband was a distant cousin of the founder of Tiffany & Co. With a high IQ, Barnhouse was admitted to Vassar College at fourteen and enrolled at sixteen. Meanwhile, she had met her first husband, Francis C. Edmonds, Jr., at a religious retreat. Francis graduated from Princeton University in 1940. They eloped in 1941 after her father forbade them from marrying. Shortly thereafter she regretted her marriage but was hesitant about ending it because she was pregnant. In 1943 she gave birth to a second child. In 1944, at twenty-one, she enrolled at Barnard College, where she completed her bachelor's degree, and continued on to Columbia University Medical School, where she earned a medical degree. She left Francis towards the end of her first year at Barnard. He, then a medical doctor, assumed full responsibility for the children. His parents took care of them until the divorce went through and he had remarried in 1947. Divorce and child custody were topics Barnhouse would later discuss in her letters to Plath. Following the divorce, she met William Beuscher, her peer at Columbia, who likewise would go on to complete a residency in psychiatry at McLean. They married and had five children, but she divorced him later, citing emotional abuse and alcoholism. While still a full-time psychiatrist and mother, Barnhouse became involved in the Episcopal church in her town. She enrolled part-time at the Weston College of Theology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and became a full-time resident in 1973 on track to obtain a master's degree in theology. However, after the Episcopal Church allowed the ordination of women in 1976, she was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1980. She then taught at Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology.  Sylvia Plath correspondence  In 1953, when she was a resident psychiatrist at McLean hospital, she developed a relationship with a college-aged Plath. Later, when Plath published The Bell Jar, Barnhouse was reincarnated as the character Dr. Nolan, the protagonist's psychiatrist during her stay at a mental hospital. According to Barnhouse, Plath was one of her first patients. They would stay in touch long after Plath left McLean, up until one week before Plath's death. At the beginning of the fourteen letters at Smith College, Plath discusses her pregnancies and her and husband Ted Hughes's writing careers, reflecting on how she will sustain her creative life as a mother. The tone becomes less optimistic, however, when she describes her suspicions of Ted's affair. Barnhouse (though referred to by Plath in her letters as ‚ÄúDr. Beuscher‚Äù) instructs Plath to hire a good lawyer and to bar Ted from her bed and her home. Publications * Plath, Sylvia.

Biography  He was born in 1878 in the village of Mirkovci, then in the Ottoman Empire, today in North Macedonia. Mandzhukov was a brother of the Colonel of the Bulgarian Army Spas Mandzhukov. He was a nephew is Metropolitan Nathanael of Ohrid, who lead him to Plovdiv, Eastern Rumelia, where he studied at a high school. Mandzhukov became one of the founders of the anarchist Macedonian Secret Revolutionary Committee there and was therefore excluded from the school. He graduated later from a pedagogical school in Lom and afterwards studied chemistry at the University of Geneva, where he became a member of the anarchist Geneva group. In the autumn of 1898 he returned to Ottoman Macedonia and became a member of the IMARO. Sentenced in March 1899 to a life prison for a conspiracy, Mandzhukov appealed the verdict, and in the same year the court dismissed him for failing to prosecute. Subsequently, he entered the cheta of Gotse Delchev in 1899. In 1900 he resided in Thessaloniki where had a contact with the Gemidzii and they were influenced by his anarchist ideas, especially those relating to methods of struggle. In 1900 together with Pavel Shatev, Slavi Merdjanov and Petar Sokolov he took part in the terrorist activity around the Ottoman Bank in Istanbul.–°–ø–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ –ü.–ì. –ú–∞–Ω–¥–∂—É–∫–æ–≤ –∑–∞ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–µ—Ç–æ –º—É –≤ —á–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ü–µ –î–µ–ª—á–µ–≤ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ 1899 –≥., –≤: ‚Äû–ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –Ω–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∏‚Äú, –∫–Ω. 23, 1972, —Å—Ç—Ä. 176 ‚Äì 200.

In September 1901, he was head of a small detachment, and attempted to free his friend Slavi Merdzhanov from the Adrianople prison, but failed. Mandzhukov then spent some time in extortion in favor of the Supreme Committee. From the spring of 1903 Mandzhukov was the leader of a small cheta of the Supreme Committee in the Rhodope Mountains. With the new detachment, he attempted to destroy the railway line near Xanthi to prevent the transfer of Ottoman troops to Thessaloniki. The vigilance of the Turkish rail guard failed this endeavor. Mandzhukov learned from the newspapers about the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903 and the deaths of the bombers themselves, among whom were his closest friends. During the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising, he was the leader of a detachment in the Smolyan area. After the uprising Mandzhukov committed a murder on the order of the Supreme Committee. The target victim was a Turk, who terrorized the Bulgarian population in the region. Only four days later, a new order followed, this time for the murder of a Bulgarian. Mandzhukov then reconsidered his role in this organization, alien to his anarchist views and shorted with Supreme Committee. From the fall of 1904 he worked in Kazanlak at the afforestation service. From 1907 to 1909 he studied forestry in Nancy, France. He participated in the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan Wars and in the First World War. Mandzhukov together with Mihail Gerdjikov was among the founders of the Federation of Anarcho-Communists in Bulgaria in 1919. After the Wars, until his retirement he worked as a forester in Kazanlak, Karlovo, Peshtera, Razlog and elsewhere.

Wulei's successor Huduershidaogao stationed Sutuhu in the southeast on the border of Wuhuan territory. Huduershidaogao's successor Wudadihou only lived for a few months before he died and was succeeded by his brother Punu in 46 AD. At the time the Xiongnu were suffering experiencing a severe drought in their territory as well as raids from the Wuhuan. Sutuhu offered to act as an agent to ask for aid from the Han dynasty. When Punu's officers heard of this they recommended that Sutuhu be arrested and executed. Sutuhu received warning of their advice to Punu and in retaliation gathered some 50,000 men to attack the officers. Punu's response to this challenge was lackluster and sent only some 10,000 men, who fled at the sight of Sutuhu's larger army. Afterwards, Sutuhu moved south to the Ordos region. In the winter of 48/49 AD, Sutuhu gained an alliance with the Han, and proclaimed himself Bi Chanyu. In 49 AD, Bi sent his brother Mo to attack Punu. They captured Punu's younger brother Aojian and returned with 10,000 captives as well as thousands of livestock. Two of Punu's chiefs also defected to join Bi. Punu was forced to relocate north across the Gobi Desert. In the spring of 50 AD, the Han sent General Duan Chen to formally establish Bi as Chanyu. Bi was forced to kowtow and declare himself a subject of the Han. He was given a gold insignia, horses, silk, and other presents. Punu's brother escaped from Bi and gathered some 30,000 supporters, declaring himself chanyu. He was defeated by Punu within a few months. Bi tried to absorb the remnants of Aojian's men but they were confronted by the Northern Xiongnu, who put them to rout. Bi died in 56 AD and was succeeded by his brother Qiufu Youti.

For example, if the probability of error P_{\\\\mathrm{error}} of a test decays as e^{-n \\\\beta}, where n is the sample size, the error exponent is \\\\beta. Formally, the error exponent of a test is defined as the limiting value of the ratio of the negative logarithm of the error probability to the sample size for large sample sizes: \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{-\\\\ln P_\\\\text{error}}{n}. Error exponents for different hypothesis tests are computed using Sanov's theorem and other results from large deviations theory. Error exponents in binary hypothesis testing Consider a binary hypothesis testing problem in which observations are modeled as independent and identically distributed random variables under each hypothesis. Let Y_1, Y_2, \\\\ldots, Y_n denote the observations. Let f_0 denote the probability density function of each observation Y_i under the null hypothesis H_0 and let f_1 denote the probability density function of each observation Y_i under the alternate hypothesis H_1. In this case there are two possible error events. Error of type 1, also called false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis is true and it is wrongly rejected. Error of type 2, also called false negative, occurs when the alternate hypothesis is true and null hypothesis is not rejected. The probability of type 1 error is denoted P (\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\mid H_0) and the probability of type 2 error is denoted P (\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\mid H_1). =Optimal error exponent for Neyman‚ÄìPearson testing= In the Neyman‚ÄìPearson version of binary hypothesis testing, one is interested in minimizing the probability of type 2 error P (\\\\text{error}\\\\mid H_1) subject to the constraint that the probability of type 1 error P (\\\\text{error}\\\\mid H_0) is less than or equal to a pre-specified level \\\\alpha. In this setting, the optimal testing procedure is a likelihood-ratio test. Furthermore, the optimal test guarantees that the type 2 error probability decays exponentially in the sample size n according to \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{- \\\\ln P (\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\mid H_1)}{n} = D(f_0\\\\parallel f_1). The error exponent D(f_0\\\\parallel f_1) is the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence between the probability distributions of the observations under the two hypotheses. This exponent is also referred to as the Chernoff‚ÄìStein lemma exponent. =Optimal error exponent for average error probability in Bayesian hypothesis testing= In the Bayesian version of binary hypothesis testing one is interested in minimizing the average error probability under both hypothesis, assuming a prior probability of occurrence on each hypothesis. Let \\\\pi_0 denote the prior probability of hypothesis H_0 . In this case the average error probability is given by P_\\\\text{ave} = \\\\pi_0 P (\\\\text{error}\\\\mid H_0) + (1-\\\\pi_0)P (\\\\text{error}\\\\mid H_1). In this setting again a likelihood ratio test is optimal and the optimal error decays as \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{- \\\\ln P_\\\\text{ave} }{n} = C(f_0,f_1) where C(f_0,f_1) represents the Chernoff- information between the two distributions defined as C(f_0,f_1) = \\\\min_{\\\\lambda \\\\in [0,1]} \\\\int (f_0(x))^\\\\lambda (f_1(x))^{(1-\\\\lambda)} \\\\, dx.

The city is the county seat of Yavapai County. In 1864 Prescott was designated as the capital of the Arizona Territory, replacing the temporary capital at Fort Whipple. The Territorial Capital was moved to Tucson in 1867. Prescott again became the Territorial Capital in 1877, until Phoenix became the capital in 1889. Included in this list are photographs of some of the structures within the Downtown Historic Preservation District (which includes \\"Whiskey Row\\"), the Courthouse Plaza Historic District, the Fort Whipple- Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Historic District and the Sharlot Hall Museum. Brief history The first known Native-American people to have settled the Prescott area are the Yavapai. The name Yavapai comes from a combination of the words Enyaleva (sun) and pai (people). Some anthropologists trace the Yavapai, also known as the ‚ÄúPeople of the Sun‚Äù, to groups who migrated from the Colorado River regions around 1,300 AD.Arizona's First People The Yavapai were mainly hunter-gatherers, following an annual round, migrating to different areas to follow the ripening of different edible plants and movement of game.Braatz, p.29 The US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased following the declaration of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, When gold was discovered in California in 1849, emigrants of European descent from the East Coast began to travel to the southwest and passed through Yavapai territory more than they had ever done so before.Braatz, p. 74 Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with them. However, settlers began moving onto the lands of the Yavapai in the 1820s, and before long had greatly diminished the Yavapai's game and agricultural lands. The Yavapai openly resisted and many were slaughtered.\\"Surviving Conquest: A History of the Yavapai Peoples\\"; By: Timothy Braatz; Publisher: U of Nebraska Press; The town-site of Prescott was officially founded in 1864, as the Territorial Capital of Arizona. The secretary of Arizona Territory, Richard Cunningham McCormick, urged that it be named for the historian William H. Prescott, whose books on the conquest of Mexico and Peru McCormick admired. William Hickling Prescott was an American historian and author. He has been called America's first scientific historian.William H. Prescott Prescott's entitlement as capital was sealed by one vote over La Paz by the first legislature. John Noble Goodwin was appointed Territorial Governor by President Abraham Lincoln. He served as such from December 29, 1863 to March 4, 1865. On June 7, 1864, the first lot in Prescott was sold for $175.00. The site where Prescott's City Hall is located in what is now 201 South Cortez Street was declared historical by the Prescott Historical Society. Fort Whipple was a tactical base for the United States Cavalry during the Indian Wars of 1864‚Äì1882. The fort was named after Lt. Amiel Whipple who was the first to discover and establish access to gold fields nearby. This new gold created conflict in the area and Fort Whipple was used to protect miners and settlers from raids. Beginning in 1865, after the American Civil War, the Yavapai were forced to live in reservations when gold was discovered in their territory. The fort was for a short period of time the capital of the Arizona Territory.Fort W hipple Prescott was incorporated in 1872, obtaining legal title to a town site originally established without regard for federal law replacing the temporary capital at Fort Whipple. Prescott: The Mile-Hi City Was Where It All Began At the same time Prescott was established as the Territorial Capital, it was also designated as the County Seat of Yavapai County, one of four original territorial counties.Brief History of Prescott Prescott served as the Territorial Capital until 1889, with the exception of the years of 1867‚Äì77, when the capital was moved to Tucson. On November 1, 1867, the capital was moved to Tucson by the act of the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The capital returned to Prescott in 1877 by the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The capital was finally moved to Phoenix on February 4, 1889, by the 15th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Richard Cunningham McCormick was appointed Territorial Governor by President Andrew Johnson on July 9, 1866. He served as such until March 4, 1869. Both governors had at one time or another resided in the Governor's Mansion which is now one of the historic structures exhibited on the grounds of the Sharlot Hall Museum.Goff pp. 26‚Äì27 By 1878, Prescott had a street known as \\"Whiskey Row\\" which was known for the establishment of many saloons, gambling parlors, opium dens and houses of prostitution. Two fires affected most the structures on the street, but none came close to causing the damage which was done in the fire of July 14, 1900. The fire known as \\"The Great Fire\\" destroyed five city blocks including most of Whiskey Row. Twelve hotels and 20 mercantile establishments were lost. After the fire, citizens soon viewed the event as a chance to replace the old wooden buildings common in the downtown area with more permanent concrete, brick and stone buildings. By 1901, the buildings in the district had been rebuilt. The original buildings which still are standing are the Hotel Palace, the D. Levy Mercantile Building and the St. Michael Hotel. Whiskey Row continued to be the center of activity for the town, known for its gambling as well as its saloons. In 1888, William \\"Buckey\\" O'Neill, who was serving as Yavapai County judge, was elected county sheriff, running on the Republican ticket. After his term was up, O'Neill was elected unanimously Mayor of Prescott. In 1898, war broke out between the United States and Spain. O'Neill joined the Rough Riders and became Captain of Troop A. On July 1, 1898, the Rough Riders and the 10th Cavalry were stationed below Kettle Hill. The Spaniards, who were on top of the hill, poured machine gun and Mauser fire down on the Americans. Buckey O'Neill was killed in action. By 1895, the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad (also known as the ‚ÄúPeavine‚Äù) connected Prescott's mining area with the Southern Pacific line. The access to the railroad bolstered the mercantile sector of the local economy and led to the establishment of several new dry goods and mining supply businesses. Communication and utilities improved along with transportation. An electric light plant was built in 1889 and telephones arrived shortly thereafter. The year 1889 also marked the year that the capital was moved to Phoenix. In spite of this political loss, Prescott continued to prosper and develop as the 19th century drew to a close. The copper-mining industry also supported area growth in the early 20th century because of the extra demands for World War I. However, by 1919 Prescott suffered the effects of postwar depression along with the rest of the state and nation. Prescott Historical Society Some of the structures in Prescott are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The fact that a property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places or that it may be eligible to be listed as such, does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner or from being removed from the NRHP listings. An example is the Goldwater Mercantile Building which was listed in 1978, reference #78003584 and removed from the list on October 2, 1992, because the historic structure was demolished in November 1978.

The Society and its Board of Trustees also maintains historical collections and makes the collections, materials and data available to the public. The Society is supported by state and private funds. The Society is authorized to purchase, receive, hold, lease and sell property for the benefit of the state and the use of the Society.Prescott Historical Society CHAPTER 3-11 of the City Code created an official listing of historic buildings and structures located within the city to known as \\"The City of Prescott Register of Historic Places\\".

They depict a bird's-eye view of the \\"ideal monastery\\" according to the Camaldolese and were likely commissioned as part of Fray Juan de Casta√±iza's (c. 1545-1599) petition to Philip II in 1597 to establish the benedictine monastic order in Spain.  Analysis  Both of the paintings are nearly identical in composition, though the version at the Instituto Valencia of Don Juan is on a slightly smaller canvas. In the mountainous landscape, within a circular forest clearing, are individual hermitages arranged into rows, with a central complex for group worship. In the foreground on either side of a tabernacle stand saints central to the foundation of the Camaldolese: Saint Benedict to the left, and Saint Romuald to the right. Romuald holds a model of the circular monastery complex in his hand. The tabernacle frames a poem in Latin praising Saint Romuald, and Latin text below identifies the image as a \\"Description of the Hermetical Life.\\" View of the Camaldolesian Community, ca. 1600, engraving, It is unlikely that El Greco had ever been to a Camaldolese monastery and he likely drew inspiration from other sources. Harold Wethey was among the first to note that the composition of these paintings was likely derived from a print depicting the Holy Hermitage of Camaldoli in the mountains near Arezzo, Italy. Robert Byron and David Talbot Rice argued that the arrangement of the monastery resembles the depiction of the Holy City of Jerusalem in the Cretan School of post-Byzantine icon painting, in which El Greco was a master before he emigrated to Italy and Spain.  Patronage  The Instituto Valencia of Don Juan canvas bears escutcheon of Mariana de Mendoza of Toledo and that of her husband Pedro Lasso de la Vega, Conde de los Arcos. The two were known to own eight original works by El Greco,Richard Kagan, ‚ÄúThe Count of Los Arcos as Collector and Patron of El Greco,‚Äù Anuario del Departamento de Historia y Teor√≠a del Arte, Vol. IV (1992): 156. as well as eighteen canvases depicting hermits.Fernando Mar√≠as El Greco: Life and Work ‚Äì A New History(London: Thames & Hudson, 2013), 203. The Allegory of the Camaldolese, however, was probably the only painting that they expressly commissioned from El Greco, showing their commitment to Fray Juan de Casta√±iza's project and their continuing support of the artist. It is unknown who commissioned the painting now at the Museo del Patriarca, though it bears the arms of Juan de Ribera, Archbishop of Valencia and Patriarch of Antioch. Fernando Mar√≠as suggests it may have been a gift from Mariana and Pedro Lasso to Ribera rather than being a personal commission.Fernando Mar√≠as El Greco: Life and Work ‚Äì A New History (London: Thames & Hudson, 2013), pp. 293 note 222.

The film's ensemble cast includes Alessandra Mastronardi, Eva Amurri, Alec Baldwin, and Giancarlo Giannini, as well as non-professional actors. Plot Charlie (Bobby Kennedy) is an American hard-partying slacker and recent college graduate whose wealthy parents (Alec Baldwin and Catherine Mary Stewart) cut him off with a cheque for $5000 and an ultimatum to get a job. Instead, eager to explore Europe, he buys a plane ticket to Italy.

Giancarlo Giannini in 2000 Thanks to Charlie's swaggering immaturity and some cultural misunderstanding, he incurs the wrath of mafiosi Don Ferracane (Giancarlo Giannini), Valentina's father, and Don Farina (Ernesto Mahieux) the boss of the three men Charlie clashed with in Rome. It turns out the van Charlie escaped in had something important belonging to the ill-tempered Don Farina, who, exasperated with his underboss Vito, threatens to kill him unless he produces results. Vito threatens Jaroslav and Il Nero in turn and the trio finally track Charlie to Bologna... Cast ;Main Enrico Silvestrin ;Supporting Production =Background and writing= Robert (Bobby) Kennedy III began writing at a young age, winning an award for a screenplay for a film noir in high school: \\"I was kind of hooked at that point.\\" AmeriQua is the first film derived from a screenplay by Kennedy. It is loosely autobiographical, based on his experiences as a \\"broke student\\" in Italy, working various jobs like waiting tables or tending bar to support himself during his study abroad in Bologna in 2005, where he met the \\"stock of wild characters\\" who populate the film, and where he \\"found himself in weird situations.\\" After graduating from Brown University, Kennedy started writing down \\"ideas, little scenes, bits of dialogue,\\" inspired by living in \\"this classic dirty student apartment in Italy, with a really intense group of characters coming in and out all the time.\\" He worked briefly for a political website and hosted a fundraiser for President Obama in 2008, but he considered himself first and foremost a writer, writing up to eight hours per day. Alec Baldwin at Cannes, 2012 Marco Gualtieri's friendship with the Kennedy family arose following his involvement with the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. The entertainment entrepreneur was also on the board of the Florence-based Robert F. Kennedy Foundation of Europe. In January 2009, while attending a reception as Ethel Kennedy's guest at the Kennedy house in Washington, D.C. celebrating President Obama's second inauguration, he was approached by Bobby Kennedy who spoke to him in Italian, saying he wanted to make a film about his experience and love for Italy: \\"Bobby ‚Ä¶ started talking to me about this film, and after 10 minutes I started laughing because he was pitching it to me, when the room was filled with Hollywood heavyweights\\". Attendees at the reception included director Ron Howard and actors Alec Baldwin and Glenn Close; Gualteri, the founder of the TicketOne concert ticket buying service, had no real connection to the world of filmmaking. After meeting Kennedy's best friend from Italy, Lele Gabellone, Gualtieri was compeletely won over. Kennedy's love of Italy convinced Gualteri to become the producer for the project. =Development and financing= Kennedy's original screenplay was in English, but it evolved into a macaronic text in English and Italian, as Bologna mystery writer and collaborator explained: > I was involved later, and together with Bobby we worked on mixing our > styles, our respective insanity, rewriting everything and enjoying ourselves > like crazy. The macaronic English of the Italians is a principal component. > It's an explosive, ungrammatical, rough comedy and full of stereotypes that > we enjoyed playing with. For the project, Gualteri's Jabadoo SRL received ‚Ç¨350,000 in support from the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, or 10.3% of its projected budget, in the form of an interest-free loan from the . Private sponsorship came from Fiat and Jaggy. Cinematographer Marco Bassano commented that the budget was considerably higher than he was used to, noting they had helicopters and \\"other things\\", and that in Italy, one is normally limited to one such kind of equipment. Eva Amurri is one of several actors playing a fictional version of herself in the film (seen here in 2011) =Casting and characters= Casting began in September 2009. Marco Gualtieri is quoted as saying that, with the exception of the \\"bad guys\\", all the other characters are based on real individuals from Kennedy's experience in Bologna. In addition, Kennedy was not the only actor playing a fictional version of himself. Charlie's love interest Vicky is played by fellow New Yorker Eva Amurri, who studied alongside Kennedy in Bologna. Marin Jo Finerty, who plays Vicky's best friend, Elsy, is an American who came to Italy to study at the age of 14, and called her character \\"a little bit of a bitch\\" and a precisina. Originally from Lecce, Lele Gabellone was working as a club promoter in Bologna when he met Kennedy at a nightclub and they became best friends. AmeriQua is his film debut, one of a number of non-professional actors who were cast because they shared experiences with Kennedy. The film also marked the debut for model and actress . Badoo (portrayed by ) is an anarchist who believes in the elimination of both national and international legal frameworks, prisons, religious dogma; his more eccentric notions include the \\"illumination of only the walk symbols on all city corners, a complete moratorium on personal hygiene, a clothes optional society and, above all, the abolition of money.\\" The character's wardrobe and overall look were inspired by Sid Vicious. Vito Facciolla, who had played criminals before in non-comedic films, said the directors chose him, , and because they worked well together as a trio as Vito and his henchmen, the thick-moustached, confrontational Jaroslav, an \\"asshole\\" from an Eastern European country who can barely make himself understood in Neapolitan dialect, and often lapses into a Slavic language, particularly when cursing, and Il Nero, a harmonica-playing rockabilly type and a man of \\"slow action\\". Facciolla and Pesceas appreciated how much space they were given and the freedom to improvise. One evening in Bologna, the trio had some time to themselves and, still in costume, were being mistaken by passersby for genuine \\"shady\\" characters, so they decided to go to local pubs and bars pretending to ask for protection money, which led to the police being called. Catherine Mary Stewart in 2011 Michele Bottini, who played Sergio, steward at Don Ferracane's restaurant, was also the film's acting coach; Kennedy and Gabellone spent a few weeks at his house in Varese, where he instructed them on \\"stage presence, annunciation and spritz drinking\\". The film owes Alec Baldwin's cameo appearance to his friendship with Kennedy's father Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Glenn Close was reportedly cast to play his wife and Charlie's mother, the role ultimately going to Catherine Mary Stewart. =Set design and props= Difficult scenes from a design point of view were Valentina's birthday party, Lele's house, the university dormitory, and the rag√π scene, which actually induced nausea among some of the people on set due to the \\"sickening smell\\". The scenes on the Alitalia flight were filmed in a flight simulator outside of Fiumicino Airport in Rome, and required cutting out cloud forms to pass by the windows, giving the impression from within the aircraft of passing clouds. =Filming= AmeriQua was shot on 35mm. The directors' previous experience was in television, working for MTV. Principal photography was originally expected to begin in Italy in Spring 2010, but did not start until 27 August, in the city of Barga, where the helicopters were used for shots around the Duomo. The production then moved to Bologna, where most of the film's scenes were shot. The nightclub scene was filmed in the same one where Kennedy and Gabellone met. The next scenes were shot in Naples (including the Citt√† della Scienza before it was destroyed in a fire) and Rome, after which, after about fifty days of shooting, the production returned to Barga once more, finishing shooting there on 17 October before the final leg of filming began a few weeks later in New York City. Alessandra Mastronardi in 2008 The final scene to be filmed, which happens to be the opening scene of the film itself, the exterior of Wagner College, was shot in early December in freezing temperatures, whereas the action is supposed to be taking place in July, with the actors in T-shirts; post- production CGI would be used to add leaves to the trees. Scenes set in the US which did not have to be filmed on location were filmed in Italy, for example, those with Alberto Tonti. Alessandra Mastronardi was skeptical about Kennedy's novice acting skills until she saw him work, and realised that as the writer and protagonist, there could be no one better to play the part and Kennedy had a flair for comedy; moreover, he was flexible, rewriting the script to make the film more fun, so often, she called AmeriQua a \\"work in progress\\". Kennedy was also very open to improvisation. During Mastronardi's first scenes under the arches of the Piazza Maggiore, with dogs, Kennedy had an idea to stuff hot dog meat in the actors' shoes so the dogs would follow them around, but, according to Mastronardi, he put too much in his own shoe, and sometimes tripped over the dogs. During a day of heavy rain which inundated Bologna, Kennedy and the directors had to reimagine a scene that would otherwise have been very difficult to shoot; the result is the scene of Kennedy and Mastronardi dancing in a church. On another occasion, Kennedy had to rewrite a scene just minutes before shooting began. Unable to drive a scooter, a stand- in was filmed for the scenes of her character driving one in the hills above Bologna. Kennedy was very nervous before filming his kiss with Mastronardi in Piazza Santo Stefano, and invited her to a bar where they and the directors each drank a shot, \\"so when we shot the scene we were slightly tipsy\\". Lucio Dalla at the Antique Fair in Arezzo, 2011 =Music= Singer and songwriter Lucio Dalla composed the original score for the film. In 2011, Gualtieri, Kennedy, and Gabellone approached Dalla, and the Bologna musician said yes almost immediately. In March 2013, a year after Dalla's 2012 death, Kennedy recalled how they spent \\"wonderful\\" days at Dalla's home in the Tremiti, and described Dalla as a generous man who always supported young artists, like Marco Sbarbati, whom he discovered, and whose single \\"I Don't Wanna Start\\" is included in the film. =Marketing and related works= The production blog's hundreds of posts finally had more minutes of video than AmeriQua itself. Nearly all of the video was taken by Sacha Cesana, and then edited by Simona Ruggeri, and eventually posted on YouTube. In the US, Alec Baldwin promoted the film in an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman on 25 February 2013. Release AmeriQua had its world premiere in Berlin, Germany, on 10 and 14 February 2012. The Italian premiere took place more than a year later at a red carpet event in Milan on 14 March 2013. The film opened in theatres across Italy on 16 May 2013. the American premiere expected to follow in July. =Home media= AmeriQua was released on DVD under the title EuroTrapped by Screen Media on 17 September 2013, described on DiscDish as \\"a strange little English-language production from Italy... with a lot of money behind it\\". Screen Media also released it on Blu-ray on 9 December 2015. =Streaming= As Eurotrapped, the film was available for streaming on Netflix until October 2015. The film is available on Amazon Prime and iTunes, also as EuroTrapped. Reception =Commercial performance= AmeriQua did very poorly following its opening weekend in Italy, which saw the film take ‚Ç¨23,134, the bulk of its final gross, ‚Ç¨26,500. There is a dearth of sources for its US box office takings; it was called a flop in passing in an American article on one of Kennedy's later projects. =Critical response= The review aggregator on the Italian website MyMovies.it assigns a rating of 2.28/5 for AmeriQua based on fifteen reviews and other notices. While it was evident that the filmmakers had very good intentions, for Alessandro Antinori, the film is disappointingly \\"amateurish\\", the product of a rough script and banal dialogue, particularly as delivered by the non-professional protagonists, Kennedy and Gabellone, and the Italian dubbing was even more embarrassing. Comparing the film unfavourably to L'Auberge espagnole, whose director C√©dric Klapisch also draws on his student experience in a foreign country, Antinori argues that AmeriQua fails to achieve its primary objective of getting past American stereotypical perceptions of Italians. Assigning it a rating of 3/10, Giancarlo Usai goes further: the film is an unforgivable attempt to overturn Italian cinepanettone stereotypes with a sloppy nonsensical script consisting of a series of poorly paced, disconnected sketches. Massimo Bertarelli opines that the film is a bizarre and weird comedy, but at the same time a feel-good and almost \\"polite\\" story. Giorgio Carbone called the film a sincere light comedy: while Kennedy is no Marlon Brando, he is assuredly better than Nicolas Vaporidis. Eugenia Paolucci felt there were too many clich√©s in the film, but she still called AmeriQua a tender portrait of the nation, and one sympathetic reviewer called the film \\"hilarious\\".

Cover became Senior Vice President and General Manager for Douglas Aircraft and later Vice President of Bell Aircraft. Early life Cover was born on April 26, 1893 to Hugh and Helen Cover in Roxbury, Pennsylvania. He attended high school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and worked as a millwright machinist at Bethlehem Steel, where his father was a foreman. Cover had three younger sisters; Margaret, Mary, and Anna. Aviation career =US Army Air Service= Cover enlisted in the US Army on August 1, 1917 and was sent to Kelly Field in San Antonio for pilot training. He was initially assigned to the 50th Aero Squadron, but was transferred to the 110th Aero Squadron later that same month. Cover was sent to the Military School of Aeronautics at UC Berkeley in November, 1917. He was commissioned as an Lieutenant in June 1918, and was assigned to Brooks Field as an instructor. In 1923, Cover was stationed at Langley Field in Virginia. =Inter-Island Airways= In 1929, Cover was flying for the Army Reserves in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was approached by Stanley Kennedy Sr. to be the Operations Manager and first employee for his start-up airline Inter-Island Airways (re-named Hawaiian Airlines in 1941). Kennedy was impressed by his background as an Army test pilot and his history of aero-engineering work. One of Cover's initial tasks was to fly Inter-Island Airways' first airplane, a Bellanca Pacemaker, from Delaware to San Francisco where it was shipped to Hawaii. Cover and Kennedy hired Navy pilot Charles Elliott as Chief Pilot. Cover, Kennedy, and Elliott, all being WWI veterans, decided on Armistice Day to be the inaugural scheduled airline flight between the Hawaiian Islands. On November 11, 1929 Elliott (flight leader) and Cover (wingman) flew Inter-Island Airways' Sikorsky S-38 amphibious seaplanes in formation from Honolulu, to Maui, then on to Hilo introducing air travel to the residents and visitors of Hawaii. =Douglas Aircraft Company= Major Cover left the Army and Inter-Island Airways in 1930 to become a test pilot for the Douglas Aircraft Company in Santa Monica, California. He soon became the Chief Test Pilot and Vice President of Sales, and eventually Senior Vice President and General Manager of Douglas Aircraft. In 1931, a TWA Fokker F-10 tri-motor airplane had a fatal crash killing Notre Dame University football coach Knute Rockne. The cause of the crash was failure of the wooden wing spar. TWA's Jack Frye lead the campaign for aircraft manufacturers to develop rugged airliners using metal construction. Douglas Aircraft responded to this request with the DC-1. On July 1, 1933 Cover flew the first test flight of the DC-1. Shortly after take- off both engines quit, Cover pushed the nose over and the engines re-started. Cover safely managed to get the airplane back on the ground after a short 12 minute flight, to find the carburetors had been installed backwards. After TWA gained experience with the DC-1, they created a list of improvements for the airliner resulting in the creation of the DC-2. On May 11, 1934 Cover flew the first test flight of the DC-2. The DC-2 was a commercial success, selling 198 aircraft. American Airlines approached Douglas Aircraft with more improvements for the DC-2. American wanted an aircraft that was bigger, could fly farther, and wide enough to accommodate sleeping berths. These design changes lead to the DC-3. On December 17, 1935 Cover flew the first test flight of the DC-3. The DC-3 is credited as one of the most significant airliners ever produced, helping create the modern airline industry and aid the Allies victory in World War II. There were over 16,000 DC-3's and military version C-47's built. On June 7, 1938 Cover flew the first test flight of the four-engine DC-4. Two days later, Cover flew the plane on a demonstration flight for United Airlines with Orville Wright on-board. The prototype DC-4 had three tail-fins and was overly complex for airlines to make a profit. The plane was re-engineered with one tail-fin, simplified systems and entered service in 1942. Douglas built 1,241 civilian and military versions of the DC-4. The prototype was renamed the DC-4E for experimental. On February 20, 1939 Cover flew the first test flight of the DC-5. There were only 12 DC-5's built and has been called \\"The Forgotten Douglas.\\" =World War II and Bell Aircraft= During World War II, General Hap Arnold requested that Cover return to active duty and help with the production and testing of the B-29 Superfortress. Cover was made Colonel and put in charge of United States Air Force Plant 6 at Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, Georgia. Plant 6 was subcontracted to Bell Aircraft for the production of the B-29 under license of Boeing. He was released from active duty in August 1944. In September 1944, Cover accepted an offer from Bell Aircraft as Vice President and the civilian General Manager of Plant 6. Death and Honors On November 27, 1944 Cover died in a plane crash while trying to land during a snow storm in Dayton, Ohio. He is buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Cover Street in the Douglas Industrial Park at the Long Beach Airport is named in his honor. Lawrence Bell, founder of Bell Aircraft, said this about Cover,\\" In my opinion no single individual in the aircraft industry has contributed more to commercial and military aviation than Carl Cover. His abilities encompass all phases from engineering and flight test to sales direction and over-all organization.\\"  References  External links * Davis-Monthan Carl Cover Profile *This Day in Aviation, Carl Cover *Test and Research Pilots, Carl Cover 1893 births 1944 deaths American test pilots Aviators from Pennsylvania Commercial aviators Hawaiian Airlines Aviation pioneers American aviation businesspeople United States Army Air Service pilots of World War I United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II United States Army Air Forces officers United States Army colonels ","title":"Carl Cover"},{"id":"60531482","text":"After Algeria defeated France in 1962 and achieved independence, the country became an important hub for revolutionary activities in the Third World. Already in the course of the Algerian War for independence between 1954 and 1962, the country had gained many international sympathizers: On the one hand, because the National Liberation Front (FLN) had succeeded in freeing itself from France by force of arms. On the other hand, also because the FLN leaders already played a leading role in international affairs (especially in the African context) before independence and established good relations with already independent countries. After gaining independence in July 1962, the government of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria (RADP) continued to take international initiatives to implement the so-called Third World Project. Thus, the FLN not only played an important role in the creation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in April 1963, but also in maintaining global coalitions such as the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Algeria and its international politics finally attracted foreign revolutionaries from all over the world and offered them not only hospitality but also military or material support. This went so far that even the most prominent movements such as the Black Panther Party settled in Algiers.  Before independence  = The Conference of Independent African States and the All-African Peoples' Conference = In 1958 the first president of independent Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, convened two international conferences in Accra: The Conference of Independent African States (CIAS) and the All-African Peoples' Conference (AAPC). At the opening days of the CIAS in April 1958, representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) appeared without being invited before and asked to petition the participating heads of state. The discussion about the Algerian questionthus became an unplanned main topic of the CIAS, which finally led to the participants of the CIAS expressing their unrestricted solidarity with the FLN. Although they refused material support, they promised to send a joint mission to various capitals to stand up for the Algerian question. At the AAPC in December 1958, Nkrumah promised in a speech his full support for all liberation movements and talked of his vision of a continental federation with sovereign African states. However, his nonviolent way to liberation was not in line with the opinion of active fighters for independence. The FLN member Ahmed Boumendjel took the word stating that France would only leave Algeria if they fight with force. Another important voice was the one of Frantz Fanon, who headed the Algerian delegation to the conference. He argued that violence is indeed needed in order to effectively fight against imperialism. Finally, the participants of the AAPC were convinced by the Algerian‚Äôs arguments and agreed that armed struggle was legitimate and that they would provide an international African Volunteer Brigade to support liberation movements. = Frantz Fanon = Frantz Fanon became an important figure for the Algerian liberation. As a psychiatric from Martinique, he came into contact with the National Liberation Army (ALN) as he provided them with psychiatric aid. Later he quit his job in an Algerian hospital, joined the movement and became writer at the FLN newspaper El Moudjahid. When he headed the Algerian delegation of the AAPC in 1958, he not only persuaded the participants of the need of an armed revolution in Algeria but also built good relationships with Patrice Lumumba (Congo), Holden Roberto (Angola) and F√©lix-Roland Moumi√© (Cameron), which had later an impact on Algeria‚Äôs role in their liberation movements. The two conferences in Accra in 1958 and Fanon‚Äôs convincing words showed that a Third World Project began to become more concrete. Finally, the publication of Fanon‚Äôs book The Wretched of the Earth in 1961 became a manual of revolution around the whole globe and marked a new stage in the awaking of the Third World. It was seen as the exemplary philosophy of violence required for the oppressed victims in an imperialist society. = Algeria's allies = These developments led to an integration of the FLN into the Third World movement at a time when the FLN involuntarily became even more transnational than it already was. This because military setbacks in Algeria led to the Morice Line, making Algeria's borders virtually impenetrable and forcing the leaders of the FLN and ALN to flee to Tunisia and Morocco. These two countries were concerned, however, that the FLN's stay could destabilise their own political conditions again. Thus, the FLN was highly motivated to win further allies. For the foreign minister of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (GPRA), Crimea Belkacem, the first priority was to pursue new paths of friendship and support not only in Africa, but also globally. Since the Arab states were still unstable at the time, he wanted to get help from China, the Soviet Union (USSR), Ghana, Guinea, Venezuela and Cuba. The GPRA succeeded in seeking recognition around the world: in October 1960, the USSR recognized the GPRA De facto and the Asian Communist countries North Korea, South Vietnam and China De jure. In addition, other Warsaw Pact nations provided the FLN with training, arms and munition. The Ghanaian and Guinean government also allowed the Algerians to set up permanent offices in their countries and the GPRA was invited to the CIAS in June 1960 officially as the recognized government of Algeria. This support received from abroad was not forgot and had impacts on the Algerian open-door policy after independence. = Influence in internal politics of other countries = Beside the activities that built diplomatic components for the FLN within Africa, the Algerians also increased their contacts in more invisible areas: they provided their assistance to other underground movements that fought against the French suppression. Since the ALN was still stuck on the Morice Line and could not enter Algeria, any unrest in the French colonial empire was seen as useful for the Algerian struggle for independence and therefore the use of resources for other liberation movements was seen as effective. The first time when the FLN influenced internal politics of other countries was in Morocco and Tunisia. The FLN was convinced that the popular masses in Morocco and Tunisia would be much more supportive for their struggle than the king Hassan II of Morocco and Tunisia‚Äôs president Habib Bourguiba and therefore promoted propaganda among those populations. They also intervened with logistical and financial support for the left-wing opposition in Morocco‚Äôs elections in May 1960. The FLN continued with interfering in politics of other already independent countries, for example in the French Sudan. The Senegalese leader L√©opold S√©dar Senghor and Mali‚Äôs leader Modibo Keita had political inclinations, which hindered a Malian Federation. The FLN delivered weapons to a Marxist rebel group in order to ensure Keita‚Äôs ascendance. Similarly, the FLN supported the Sawaba party from Niger and the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) to overthrow the government in power. The initiatives with the Sawaba party and the UPC were the beginning of with a bigger engagement with rebellious forces over the whole continent. Through the permanent presence in the capitals of Ghana, Guinea and also Egypt which were major nexuses of the trans-African support network for revolutions, the Algerians connected with different groups not only from the Maghrib-Saharan region. This led to the fact that by the end of 1960, Algeria had provided guns, training or money to nationalist movements from Cameroon, Belgian Congo, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali, Morocco, Tunisia, Niger but also established relationships with Angola and South Africa. The ALN established guerrilla training camps in Morocco, Tunisia and Mali, were fighters of the whole Continent were taught and at the same time the idea of international solidarity was fostered. Therefore, the FLN was seen as a main contributor to a spirit of a combative pan-African internationalism. The combination of diplomatic components and all those relationships with other underground movements integrated the FLN in the transnational Third World trend and made the Algerian rebels to important promoters of ideas, methods, training and equipment among revolutionaries. This is significant considering the fact, that so far Algeria hasn‚Äôt achieved its own independence but already played a central role in the Pan-Africanism.  After independence  After becoming independent the ideals of Pan-Africanism remained a central component of Algeria‚Äôs international agenda. = Ben Bella‚Äôs influence = After achieving independence in July 1962, the People‚Äôs Democratic Republic of Algeria (RADP) continued to pursue the goal of becoming a leader in the Third World project. The first president Ahmed Ben Bella presented Algeria as a pilot state and a socialist experiment, which other African countries should follow and positioned Algeria in a moral sphere as a superpower. In front of the UN General Assembly in 1962, Ben Bella stated that Algeria will play the role of a responsible country regarding international security and peace issues and will support the black liberation movements in South Africa. In the same year, Ben Bella visited Cuba to show, that Algeria‚Äôs responsibility is not limited to the African Continent. The Algerian government showed their responsibility also with their immigration politics: it accepted influx of different idealists with visions to build a new world: thousands of foreigners arrived from France, Tunisia and Morocco during the first months of the new country, which often supported the FLN already during the Algerian War for independence. The so called Pieds-rouges were visionaries that wanted to participate in the new Third World Project, an alternative to the Western and Eastern examples. In addition to that, Ben Bella committed to the principle of anticolonial solidarity and his country offered support and hospitality to underground movements over the whole globe. Therefore, Algiers became soon a hub for liberation organizations and exile for political opponents. Offices of all thinkable liberation organizations were in Algiers: the Viet Cong, African National Congress, Mozambique Liberation Front, The People‚Äôs Movement for the Liberation of Angola, Palestine Liberation Organization and other Palestinian fedayeen, and opponents of Francoist Spain. The nationalist rebel Amilcar Cabral from Guinea-Bissau therefore once named Algiers as the Mecca of Revolution. However, Ben Bella was also aware that the Third World Project could only be effective, if the nonaligned countries develop a real solidarity that goes over moral principles but become politically and economically concrete. Therefore, Ben Bella actively fostered the institutionalization of Third World‚Äôs principles and contributed for example strongly to the foundation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963. In the founding conference of the OAU he stated that the new organization must concretely support liberation movements with arms, money and training in order to really achieve something. He said: ‚ÄúLet us all agree to die a little, so that the people still under colonial rule may be free and African unity may not become a vain word.‚Äú Ben Bella's personal influence became particularly apparent after he was overthrown in 1965. During his short term in office, the president succeeded in becoming one of the most prominent leaders in the Third World. This is why the new regime under Houari Boumedienne was facing a crisis of legitimacy after the coup d'√©tat. Both Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was very powerful in the Arab world, and African heads of state (Ghana and Tanzania) spoke out against the fall of Ben Bellas and demanded an investigation. Fidel Castro from Cuba called the Boumedienne and his followers enemies of socialism and the Algerian revolution. = Algeria's role within Africa = At independence Algeria was already well-positioned to have significant influence in African affairs. Not only did Algeria have the prestige and enthusiasm to influence developments in Africa, they also had the military troops and equipment to support other countries. Algeria gained soon after its independence even more respect especially of the colonies from the Portuguese Empire in Africa probably because it continued to support other liberation movements and seemed not to fear diplomatic reprisals from Western countries. By the end of 1962, Algeria offered already equipment, refuge and training to eight countries in Africa and promoted their assistance publicly. However, many countries were already independent by 1962 and therefore the Algerian government faced more a challenge between ideological purity and African unity. For example, their support for left-wing revolutionaries in Niger and Cameroon could threatened the creation of a continental intergovernmental institution. It was therefore Ben Bella, who launched a peacemaking campaign and spoke to different revolutionary groups in more Western oriented states such as the Ivory Coast. At the same time, Algeria also convinced other more radical countries in Africa, namely Guinea and Ghana for an African unity. However, this also required efforts to convince these countries that Algeria is not doing so in order to increase its own weight on the African continent. The mediating role of Algeria was finally a contribution to a successful founding of the OAU in April 1963. After the OAU conference, Algeria consolidated their diplomatic position by visiting different West African countries and welcome African leaders in Algiers. By the end of the year, Algeria succeeded in becoming a prominent actor over the whole continent and in enjoying good relationships with numerous countries. This was important since the Algerians made during the OAU a lot of compromises in order to reach African-unity but probably hoped to lead the governments of the OAU countries later in a more progressive direction. = Algeria‚Äôs role beyond Africa = The Algerian government was particularly active in Africa, but wanted to spread the Third World Project on a global level. The Algerian government saw the OAU as a pioneer for the global Third World Project and hoped for a global coalition of all revolutionary forces. Algeria was also to play a mediating role in this, primarily through the support of non-governmental movements. This gave Algeria acquaintances with movements around the world. In particular, the Algerian network expanded to Latin America: A group of Argentine guerrillas was included in the training, and shortly afterwards a delegation from the Venezuelan National Liberation Front was also included. In addition, Algeria became a bridge from the outside world to Africa and other sovereign states: For example, Ben Bella gave Fidel Castro's regime access to the outside world by trying to alleviate Cuba's export isolation. This could be seen as a provocation of the United States of America (USA). However, Algeria also benefited from medical teams sent to Algeria by the Castro regime, which in turn was the first actual implementation of Cuba's humanitarian internationalism. Yugoslavia was another important ally, a country that was not strongly integrated in Europe and therefore searched for access to Africa via Algeria. The Algerian government told Josip Broz Tito that the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was to be expanded and the Yugoslav government sought to strengthen its commitment to the decolonization of Africa. Cooperation was thus of mutual benefit: Yugoslavia benefited from Algeria's high credibility in Africa and contributed practical resources by equipping revolutionary movements with military material. However, Algeria's foreign policy has also created hostilities between major powers, especially the USA. After the Algerians had supported more opposition movements (Morocco, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Cameroon) shortly after the founding of the OAU and had intensified their cooperation with Cuba and Yugoslavia, which were also involved in shaping African affairs, this was also seen as an international fight against the USA. In 1963, when Ben Bella expressed the wish to visit the White House, president John F. Kennedy refused. Thus, the beginning of Algeria's independent foreign policy was also seen as a new world in which smaller countries tried to resist the great powers.  Black Panther Party in Algeria  The reception of the Black Panther Party (BPP) in Algiers may have been another provocation for the USA, but was in line with the country's foreign policy at the time and probably mainly related to Algeria's position in the Third World. = Arrival = The Black Panther Party, which members called themselves the vanguard of the American Revolution, was at the time the most notorious militant Black organization in the USA. According to the FBI the greatest threat to the internal security of the country. In June 1969 the Minister of Information of the BPP, Eldridge Cleaver, who was threatened with imprisonment in the US, arrived in Algiers. Originally his plan would have been to find asylum in Cuba, but he was only granted the status of a clandestine guest. Convinced by the Cuban authorities, that he would be more freely in his political activity in Algeria, he travelled to Algeria, where nobody expected his arrival. This was probably due to the fact that cooperation between Cuba and Algeria had practically come to a standstill since the fall of president Ahmed Ben Bella. Finally, the head of the FLN‚Äôs office in charge of liberation movements, Slimane Hoffman, agreed to welcome Cleaver under the condition, that his presence in Algiers was announced first by the Algeria Press Service (APS). In the press conference he proclaimed: ‚ÄúOppressed people need unity based on revolutionary principles rather than skin color.‚Äù = Time in Algeria = In October 1969 the International Section of the BPP requested with a petition official status as a liberation movement in Algeria, which was shortly after approved. In this year the International Section of the BPP initiated training sessions for movements from South Africa and Ethiopia and became unofficial bodyguards of members of the African National Congress. During this time, the Panthers were admired in the revolutionary scene, especially because their lifestyle remained American: they had material resources (villas, cars, horses) that other liberation movements could only dream of and a big media coverage. In 1970, Timothy Leary and his wife Rosemary fled prison and reached Algeria in 1970. Their presence posed a danger to the presence of the Panthers, as the couple was known for their drug use and verbal excesses. In 1971 they were placed under house arrest by Cleaver. Also, in 1970, Huey Newton, leader of the BPP, got out of prison and applied for a visa for Algeria. This was rejected and the Panther section in Algeria under Cleaver increasingly separated from the one in the USA under Huey Newton. Finally, the Algerian Panthers split from the BPP and renamed themselves the Revolutionary People‚Äôs Communication Network (RPCN). From that moment, money was a constant concern for the party. Abroad, it became increasingly difficult to win financial support for the split Algiers group. In June 1972, a hijacked plane from the USA arrived in Algeria and delivered the Panther USD 500,000. Another hijacked plane landed in Algiers a few months later, but this time the Algerian authorities controlled the incident and the money did not go to the Panthers. This could be seen as a proof that Algeria defined itself as a critic of the imperialist West and leader of the Third World, but not as a Rogue state. The Algerian government made clear that they would not be accomplices in hijacking planes, even if they guaranteed the hijackers asylum. = Tensions with Algerian government = After the aircraft incidents, the Algiers-Panthers addressed an open letter to president Houari Boumediene accusing the Algerian government of turning its back on the struggle of the Afro-American people. This letter, which openly insulted the Algerian government, had strong consequences. The host Algeria was active in the international politics of non-aligned nations, supported movements throughout the southern hemisphere and thus had a lot at stake. It was probably the reason why Algeria did not want to be forced into a role by the international kidnappers, a state that does not abide by the rules. The letter showed probably also that the Panthers did not understand the policies of their host country and did not understand the balance of power. After all, the Algiers-Panthers were almost homeless: They had split off from the organization in the USA, international support was dwindling, and they were no longer welcome in Algeria. Nevertheless, the Algiers-Panthers continued to receive a monthly scholarship from the FLN Office for Freedom Movements, which in turn showed that the party was not expelled from Algeria. However, they left the country in 1977.

This was the culmination of several assassination attempts against him,Ciobanu, p. 56.Ignat & Matei, pp. 71, 72, 75; Savu, pp. 69‚Äì70. which included an attack on the Romanian Athenaeum and bombing a bridge over the D√¢mbovi≈£a River ‚Äî both of which were uncovered by police.Ignat & Matei, p. 72. CƒÉlinescu was on a secret blacklist at the same time as Nicolae Titulescu, Dinu BrƒÉtianu, and General Gabriel Marinescu. Assassination The action was apparently carried out with German approval and assistance.Ciobanu, pp. 57, 58, 59; Ignat & Matei, pp. 71‚Äì73; Savu, p. 69.Veiga, p. 262. On 1 September, representatives of Germany, Fascist Italy, and the Iron Guard met in Copenhagen with Mihail R. Sturdza (Romania's ambassador to Denmark and a supporter of Sima), to discuss CƒÉlinescu's killing.Ciobanu, p. 58.Ignat & Matei, p. 73. Some details of the subsequent plan were offered to Romanian authorities by a renegade member of the Iron Guard, Mihai V√¢rfureanu.Ciobanu, p. 57; Ignat & Matei, pp. 71‚Äì72. A death squad was formed, having as its members the lawyer Dumitru \\"Miti\\" Dumitrescu (who had been trained by the Gestapo and returned to Romania through Hungary), the students Cezar Popescu, Traian Popescu, Ion Moldoveanu, Ion R. Ionescu, and the draftsman Ion Vasiliu. Contacting each other in the area around Ploie≈üti, they initially planned to kill CƒÉlinescu, King Carol and General Marinescu together, and probably aimed to accomplish this in the Prahova Valley.Ignat & Matei, pp. 71, 72, 73. On 21 September, while passing through the Eroilor area on its return from the Cotroceni Palace, CƒÉlinescu's luxury automobile, a Cadillac, was ambushed by that of the assassins, who shot CƒÉlinescu, his bodyguard Radu Andone, and his driver. Miti Dumitrescu drove his car into the Premier's, which came to sudden stop as it ran into a cart ‚Äî Andone was gunned down as he stepped out of the car, and CƒÉlinescu as he was waiting on the back seat; over twenty bullets were recovered from his body.Ciobanu, pp. 58‚Äì59; Ignat & Matei, pp. 74‚Äì75.Veiga, p. 261. Sima, who is known to have crossed the border illegally in August of that year,Ciobanu, p. 59. was alleged to have disguised himself as a woman in order to witness the actions from nearby; other sources indicate a certain Marin StƒÉnculescu as the covert supervisor.Ignat & Matei, p. 74. Ironically, CƒÉlinescu had never trusted the safety of his Cadillac, and had repeatedly asked GavrilƒÉ Marinescu to allow him use of an armored car. The group of assassins left the vicinity before the arrival of police forces, and stormed into offices of the Radio Broadcasting Society, holding the employees at gunpoint and cutting short the live airing of a waltz. Traian Popescu announced that the group had killed the Premier.Ignat & Matei, p. 71. The message was not broadcast, as, unbeknownst to the assassins, transmission had already been interrupted by radio staff. Legacy The vast majority of sources reacting to the events made ample mention of German backing for CƒÉlinescu's killers, with the exception of German media. German sources alleged that Polish and British political forces had supported the assassination as a means to pressure Romania into abandoning its neutrality ‚Äî this version was supported by, among others, Hans Fritzsche.Ignat & Matei, p. 76. An even more severe repression of the Iron Guard followed under the provisional leadership of Gheorghe Arge≈üanu ‚Äî it was inaugurated by the immediate execution of the assassins and the public display of their bodies at the murder site, for days on end.Ciobanu, p. 60.Ignat & Matei, p. 75. A placard was set up on the spot, reading De acum √Ænainte, aceasta va fi soarta trƒÉdƒÉtorilor de ≈£arƒÉ (\\"From now on, this shall be the fate of those who betray the country\\"), and students from several Bucharest high schools were required to visit the site (based on the belief that this was going to dissuade them from affiliating with the Guard).Veiga, pp. 261‚Äì262. Executions of known Iron Guard activists were ordered in various places in the country (some were hanged on telegraph poles, while a group of Legionnaires was shot in front of Ion G. Duca's statue in Ploie≈üti); in all, 253 were killed without trial.Iordachi, p. 39. CƒÉlinescu was succeeded by Marinescu as Minister of the Interior and by Ioan Ilcu≈ü as Minister of Defense. One year later, the Iron Guard took its revenge against the repressors. Under the National Legionary State (the Iron Guard's government), Marinescu and Arge≈üanu, alongside other politicians, were executed in Jilava prison, in the Jilava massacre of September 1940. Also at that time, the CƒÉlinescu family crypt in Curtea de Arge≈ü was dynamited,\\"Rumania Tries Arms Maker in Guard Revolt\\", in The Washington Post, 29 January 1941. while a bronze bust of him which awaited unveiling was chained and dragged through the streets of Pite≈üti. CƒÉlinescu's wife Adela was required to hand all of her husband's personal documents, and, in a letter to ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu, claimed to have been repeatedly harassed by agents of Siguran≈£a Statului.\\"Din arhiva...\\" References 1939 murders in Europe Assassinated Romanian politicians People assassinated by the Romanian Iron Guard September 1939 events Terrorist incidents in the 1930s 1939 in Romania ","title":"Assassination of Armand CƒÉlinescu"},{"id":"60531493","text":"Hansj√∂rg Auer (; 18 February 1984 ‚Äì 16 April 2019) was an Austrian mountaineer, noted for his free solo climbs, particularly of \\"The Fish\\" in the Italian Dolomites. National Geographic described him as \\"one of the boldest and best climbers in the world.\\" He died in an avalanche while climbing on Howse Peak in the Canadian Rockies. Personal life Auer was born in Zams, Tyrol, on 18 February 1984, and lived in the √ñtztal area of Tyrol. In 2017, he published an autobiography entitled S√ºdwand, in which he describes his problems with anorexia. He considered the Italian alpinist Reinhold Messner to be a role model. Career Auer's first major free solo climb was \\"Tempi Moderni\\" (\\"Modern Times\\"), an route of 27 pitches graded 5.11d/7+, on the south face of Marmolada in the Dolomites in northeastern Italy, which he climbed in 2006. The climb took 2 hours 40 minutes. He is perhaps best known for his 2007 free solo climb of the \\"Via Attraverso il Pesce\\", commonly known as \\"The Fish\\", also on Marmolada's south face. The 37-pitch () route, named for a fish-shaped niche in the 20th pitch, is highly committing, and is graded 5.12c/7b+. There are eight particularly hard pitches bracketing the niche, including some overhanging sections. The route was first climbed by the Czech Jindrich Sustr and the Slovak Igor Koller in 1981, using ropes. It was soloed by the Italian climber Maurizio Giordani in 1990; Giordani used a rope to belay himself on some of the pitches and took 10 hours. Auer had failed to redpoint the climb with a partner in 2004. He started his 2007 attempt on 28 April by practising sections, after abseiling in from the top of the wall. He then free soloed it successfully on 29 April, without using any rope, in 2 hours 55 minutes. It was the second solo climb of the route. Auer's free climb has been compared with the 2017 free solo climb of El Capitan in the Yosemite National Park by Alex Honnold. Alpinist magazine described it in 2007 as \\"one of the most difficult, long free solos ever tackled\\", commenting that it could be described as a \\"speed ascent\\". He subsequently focused on mountains of over in the Himalaya and the Karakoram ranges, and is known for making several first ascents. These include that of the south face of Nilgiri South in the Annapurna Massif, Nepal, and of the west wall of Lupghar Sar (2018) and the south-west face of Kunyang Chhish East in the Karakorum Mountains, Pakistan. His first ascent of Lupghar Sar West was climbed solo. He was posthumously honoured with a Piolet d'Or in 2019 for this achievement. Death Auer died on descent after reaching the summit of Howse Peak in Banff National Park of the Canadian Rockies on 16 April 2019, with fellow Austrian David Lama and the American Jess Roskelley. The group completed a difficult variation of a route on the east face of Howse Peak known as M-16. The Auer-Lama-Roskelley variation took a line to the left of M-16, after the first difficult waterfall pitch on that route. Their bodies were found on 21 April 2019. Photographic and GPS evidence recovered from the accident site and from Jess Roskelley's iPhone show they left their camp at the base of the east face at approximately 05:30 AM, climbed the first difficult ice pitch on M-16 by 07:19 AM, and then traversed left on new terrain into a left-leaning ramp. After a pitch and a half up the ramp, they traversed left again and climbed an exceptionally difficult unclimbed waterfall, which brought them to a long, steep snow gully. They climbed the gully and then traversed over a snow rib further left into the large snow basin that is drained by the icefall route, \\"Life by the Drop\\". They climbed up the snow basin to the south ridge, which they ascended to the summit. Their summit photos were taken at 12:41 PM and 12:44 PM. The last photo on Auer's camera places them rappelling into the top of the snow basin at 1:27 PM. It can be deduced from a photograph taken from the highway by a local climber from Canmore that a large cornice broke off above the snow basin and swept the route above \\"Life by the Drop\\" at 1:58, 31 minutes after they dropped into the basin to descend their route. Their bodies were recovered from an avalanche cone below \\"Life by the Drop\\" on 21 April 2019. The shallow layer of snow covering the bodies is a further indicator of a cornice break as the cause of the accident.

It is a barangay at the southwestern edge of Para√±aque and north of its border with Manuyo, Las Pi√±as. The village is centered on the westernmost section of Dr. Santos Avenue (former Sucat Road) where it veers north and parallels Elpidio Quirino Avenue (former Calle Real) with De Leon Street and Aldana Avenue forming its boundaries with La Huerta and Manuyo Uno respectively. It extends to the east along the San Dionisio River-Villanueva Creek by the village of Moonwalk to the north and along Balong Creek by Manuyo Dos, Las Pi√±as to the south towards its border with San Isidro. San Dionisio includes a large swath of the C-5 Road South Extension properties in Para√±aque including the Amvel Business Park, Avida Sucat and SM City Sucat sites, the Irasan Complex logistics hub, and as well as the area surrounding the Evacom Plaza. It also covers a significant portion of the reclaimed Freedom and Long Islands in the Las Pi√±as‚ÄìPara√±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area. San Dionisio is the second largest barangay in Para√±aque in terms of land area and the third largest in terms of population. It is often mistakenly referred to as Sucat being the location of SM City Sucat shopping mall on the former Sucat Road. This erroneous reference is also applied to the other villages along the Sucat Road. Sucat, however, is a village of Muntinlupa located at the opposite end of Sucat Road by the South Luzon Expressway. As of the 2015 census, San Dionisio had a population of 63,506. History San Dionisio chapel The history of San Dionisio is tied to the establishment of its namesake visita or chapel south of La Huerta. The visita was named after its patron, Saint Denis, whose headless image is enshrined in the brick stone chapel on Elpidio Quirino Avenue (formerly Calle Real), which was originally a wooden chapel built in 1640.Dulce Festin Baybay, Ariel Marquez-de Guzman (2001). Palanyag to Para√±aque: A History, p. 182. City of Para√±aque, Philippines. Tata Dune, as the saint is fondly called by residents and devotees, is also the patron saint of Paris and all of France who was martyred by means of being beheaded by a sword for his faith. Community life revolved around religious events during the Colonial Period when residents also engaged in traditional industries such as fishing, saltmaking and embroidery. This changed with the development of gated communities and expansion of Nichols Field into a civil international airport in the mid 20th century. In 1978, the gated communities of BF Homes, Teoville, Goodwill Phase II, Irene-ville, Santa Rita Village and Jackielou Subdvision were carved out of San Dionisio to form the present barangay of BF Homes Para√±aque. In the same year, the village lost Clarmen Village, Salvador Estate, Lopez Village, Villa Mendoza, Para√±aque Green Heights and a small portion of San Antonio Valley to a new barangay named San Isidro. The rest of San Antonio Valley, Barangay Village 4th Estate Subdivision and Mon El Subdivision were annexed to the new barangay of San Antonio later that year. The village lends its name to one of the oldest and successful cooperatives in the country, the San Dionisio Credit Cooperative. Culture An annual street drama performance of Moros y cristianos is staged at the plaza of the San Dionisio Chapel on the former Calle Real in May. This tradition, commonly known as moro-moro or comedia (), dates back to the Spanish colonial period and is currently organized by the San Dionisio Cultural Society and played by the Komedya ng San Dionisio troop founded in 1962. The village also participates in the Sunduan festival of La Huerta and celebrates its annual patron saint's day in September. Education San Dionisio hosts the main campus of Para√±aque National High School. It is also the location of the following institutions: * AMA University Para√±aque Campus * St. Andrew's School, Inc. * College of Divine Wisdom * Escuela de San Dionisio * Infotech College Institute of Arts and Sciences * Olivarez College * Para√±aque Central Elementary School * Para√±aque City College of Science and Technology * Para√±aque Elementary School * Premiere Computer Learning Center * Rogationist College Para√±aque Campus * San Dionisio Elementary School * St. Augustine School of Nursing * STI College Para√±aque Campus * Universal College Transportation Dr. Santos Avenue, also known as Sucat Road, in San Dionisio The El Shaddai (movement) International House of Prayer in Amvel Business Park near C-5 Road San Dionisio's transportation network consists of two national primary roads, one national secondary road and one expressway as of 2017. The Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway and Elpidio Quirino Avenue provide north-south connectivity, with the latter traversing the village's old section and the Kabihasnan commercial row along Victor Medina Street. The village's main east-west corridor is Dr. Santos Avenue which links its old section with the bigger commercial developments in its eastern sector, including the SM City Sucat shopping mall. In a bend of the avenue north of Victor Medina Streets starts Ninoy Aquino Avenue, a national secondary road that links the village to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport as well as the popular Dampa, a collection of stalls and restaurants near the boundary with La Huerta that sell and cook fresh and locally-caught seafood. A recent addition to the village's road network is the south extension of C-5 Road which opened a large tract of former idle lands south of the international airport in San Dionisio to vertical commercial and residential developments in 2007. When the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 is extended to Cavite, it will have a station in San Dionisio located on the intersection of C-5 Road and Dr. Santos Avenue. The C-5 South Link Expressway will also cut across the village parallel to the existing C-5 Road towards an interchange with the Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway in Las Pi√±as.

Ryan refused to give up possession of the hotel. He is quoted as saying: \\"I am not going to budge. He has robbed me of about ¬£5,000. Now to be taken out without house or home, you can guess that it will be a case of a contest until my securities are restored.\\"Mirror, 3 June 1922, p.1.

Ryan was charged with unlawfully having the explosives in his possession for the purpose of blowing up the hotel. At the trial, Detective Sergeant Cowie said Ryan confessed to intending to blow up the hotel. Ryan said the explosives were for dam sinking and clearing on his farm. Without retiring to consider their verdict, the jury acquitted him.The Avon Gazette and York Times 14 July 1922, p.2.

Bull premiered on May 15, 2019 in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival. The Hollywood Reporter named Bull one of the best films at the Cannes Film Festival. Reviews have stated that the film is \\"moving\\" and that the two main characters \\"Morgan and Havard are excellent as the leads and are immensely likeable characters\\" \\"create a quiet storm.\\" Sight & Sound gave the film a five star review and noted that \\"Bull,...is a mesmerising film, and one that will linger in the imagination long after the sounds of the crickets have faded.\\" The Playlist also states that \\"the result is a sensitive, if occasionally orthodox, treatment of a compassionate friendship enacted in the face of societal apathy\\" and that \\"it's a hardscrabble tale of one singular bond amidst a landscape of socio-economic struggle.\\" IndieWire writes that the film is \\"The Rider Meets The Wrestler in Striking Portrait of Black Rodeos.\\" IndieWire goes on to use the words \\"Touching, absorbing and poignant\\" to describe the film and states that it is \\"a wondrous vision of life on the edge\\" and \\"an evocative coming-of-age story...carried by a pair of astounding performances that hover on a plane of their own, generating unique chemistry that finds its emotional center with time.\\" The Hollywood Reporter also praises the direction stating that it is a \\"a poignantly restrained feature debut.\\" Ion Cinema distinguishes the film with other titles by stating that the main character's relationship \\"exemplifies facets of humanity most of Bull's comparable titles do not.\\" Film Threat states that the film \\"is shot beautifully in a slice-of-life style of storytelling.

Their lives are portrayed as real, like a wind-up toy and you simply follow where it goes. Conflict never feels contrived, and Havard and Morgan give wonderfully subtle authentic performances. Your right there as Kris and Abe as the two make tough choices to get them to the next stage of their lives. It‚Äôs a subtle tale about the bonds of friendship in times of hopelessness.\\" In addition, Cinemayward gave the film a 4/5.

The film easily could have descended into mawkishness, but instead the travails of Kris and Abe feel entirely real, and thus all the more moving. Silverstein takes Bull by the horns and drags us into this world, making us feel a part of these characters, witnessing their strengths and weakness as they come to grips with the challenges of life in their Texas town.\\" The film has also been compared to the film, The Rider, but has been keenly distinguished: \\"far from being a carbon copy, it is another multifaceted cinematic examination of characters that are often pushed to the peripheries or treated with pity.

It was released in 1993 and marked the band's first release through Victory Records. Firestorm has been described as a landmark release in hardcore punk for its metal influences and political, militant lyrics. The title track is considered Earth Crisis' best-known song.  Background and recording  After recording Earth Crisis' debut EP, All Out War (1992), drummer Mike Riccardi was unable to commit himself to touring and was replaced by Dennis Merrick. In 1993, the band recorded a demo of Firestorm and sent it to several labels, some of which praised it but were afraid of a possible backlash due to its lyrics. After Victory Records head Tony Brummel had dismissed it, there were plans to release it on the newly formed Incision Records but following a very successful show at More Than Music Fest in Dayton, Ohio, Brummel changed his mind and approached Earth Crisis for a multiple-record contract. Vocalist Karl Buechner had, by the time of the deal, been two years in college with the intention of becoming a history teacher, but ultimately left it to focus on his music career. Likewise, guitarists Scott Crouse and Benjamin Read, who were around fifteen years old, dropped out of high school at the time for the same reason. In the summer of 1993, at the beginning of the national All Out War tour, Earth Crisis recorded Firestorm with music engineer Bill Korecky in his Mars Studios (Cleveland, Ohio). Bassist Ian Edwards could not travel because he was attending his senior year in high school. The band recruited a temporary bassist with the requirement that he has to be vegan straight edge, but after realizing that the player was not as good as they expected, Crouse and Read recorded the instrument. Buechner affirms that the band had better chemistry than on their previous EP, which was made when they were only around five months together. During the recording of Firestorm, Crouse said that Buechner \\"lost\\" his voice. Some songs from the Firestorm demo have been re- released: \\"The Order That Shall Be\\" ended up on the 1995's benefit compilation album Stones to Mark a Fire for an Animal Liberation Front prisoner; \\"Forced To Kill\\" and \\"Behind the Mask\\" on the 2009 vinyl Forced to Kill (Seventh Dagger Records); and \\"Behind the Mask\\" and \\"Time of Strife\\" on the 2015 EP The Discipline (Bullet Tooth Records).  Music and lyrics  Firestorm is characterized by palm muted, staccato guitar riffs without solos, screaming vocals and militant, political lyrics. Although their previous EP already exhibited metallic influences, these were considerably more prominent on Firestorm and the production improved. This metallic hardcore sound would be the basis for their next albums which further developed it. \\"Firestorm\\", the first track, starts with E open chords and \\"a focused, unrelenting tone\\" which anticipates the arrangements of \\"extended mosh parts\\" during the EP. Its lyrics call for a purging of drug gangs and cartels as well as corrupt politicians and law enforcement in a neighborhood submerged in drug addiction and crime, declaring \\"violence against violence\\". Other authors state that its militancy is also directed at animal abusers. Vocalist Karl Buechner said that he composed it following the drug-fueled crimes and violence that escalated through the first half of the 1990s in northern Syracuse, where his nephew, girlfriend and previously himself had lived. He put the song in line with books by the original Black Panther Party, such as Seize the Time or Will You Die with Me?, and in further interviews revealed that \\"Firestorm\\" was also inspired by Scott Cody, a Black Panther from South Los Angeles who ended up in jail after fighting drug dealers. \\"Forged in the Flames\\" (which is connected to \\"Firestorm\\" on the same track) concerns personal and spiritual strength achieved through straight edge. \\"Unseen Holocaust\\" addresses the colonization and genocide of indigenous cultures by European Christian conquerors, a topic that \\"horrifies\\" the band. The last track, \\"Eden's Demise\\", describes an ecological collapse caused by humanity, anthropomorphizing the Earth as being tortured and stating that veganism is the solution. Throughout the EP, Earth Crisis likens drug dealers and powerful people who damage the ecosystem to \\"demons\\". Live High Five described the screamed lyrics as \\"idealistic, passionate, and incredibly pissed off\\".  Reception and impact  The song \\"Firestorm\\" drew controversy for its extremist lyrics. As stated by Greg Bennick, \\"Maximum Rocknroll and other people on the scene got upset. [...] Was Earth Crisis saying they were going to round up drug dealers, block by block? You would imagine them walking down the streets in jackboots [which are often associated with totalitarianism]. But in no way is that what they were suggesting. To me, they were on the path of righteousness and compassion, and that appealed to me.\\" Some people criticized its simple structure as well; according to guitarist Scott Crouse they \\"alluded to us not being able to play or write anything with substance,\\" which \\"subconscious[ly]\\" led the band to write more complex music on the next album. By the same token, others acclaimed its straightforwardness, including MetalSucks who regarded it as \\"a Mondrian/Rothko-like masterpiece of restraint\\" and Brian Cook stating that its \\"mosh-tastic songwriting\\" was \\"genius\\". The track has since been called a straight edge anthem and become Earth Crisis' best-known song. Several authors describe Firestorm as a landmark release in hardcore punk for its introduction of metal elements and militant eco-political lyrics, which in turn inspired numerous bands. In 2000, it was chosen as one of the \\"Best Hardcore Punk Singles of the 90s\\" by Maximumrocknroll, with columnist Max Ward proclaiming: \\"I think that record changed everything in hardcore. Good recording, confrontational.\\" According to MetalSucks, the title song \\"defined 90s hardcore\\" and has one of the best breakdowns of all time. Reba Meyers of Code Orange called Firestorm the record that changed her life. The ring name of late professional wrestler Adam Firestorm was based on the song. \\"Firestorm\\" has been covered by Refused, Botch, Maroon and Embrace Today. Maroon quotes it in their animal liberation song \\"24HourHate\\" of 2006. Ska punk band Link 80 quotes it in their 1997 song \\"DimeStore Hoods\\". Other bands parodied the over- the-top militance of \\"Firestorm\\", including the songs \\"Firestorm, My Ass\\" by Propagandhi (which compares it to Kristallnacht), \\"In Defense of All Life\\" by Good Clean Fun and \\"Get the Kid with the Sideburns\\" by Reversal of Man. In retrospective interviews, Propagandhi vocalist Chris Hannah expressed admiration for the uncompromising animal liberation message of Earth Crisis and the vegan straight edge scene.

These creeks are distributaries of the Warrego River. The predominant land use is grazing of cattle and sheep.  History  The locality's name come from the parish and creek of the same name, which in turn was the name of a pastoral run used since 1867. It is believed to be an Aboriginal word combination meaning turn around quickly. In 1878 the Widgeegoara Station was described when offered for sale as: > The well-known Widgeegoara Station, in the Warrego district, situate about > 180 miles from Bourke, and containing about 180 square miles of magnificent > sheep country, consisting of open plains, heavily grassed with blue, barley, > and other grasses and herbage, and saltbush in abundance, and is of the most > fattening description.

In October 1884 Messrs Bignell of Widgeegoara Station successfully constructed a bore that obtained sub-artesian water, the first in Queensland. Widgeegoara Provisional School opened circa 1898. From May 1903 it was a half-time school operated in conjunction with Abbadoah Provisional School (presumably at Abbadoah Station at ) with a single teacher serving at the two schools, but that arrangement was reversed in June 1903 with the teacher returning to Widgeegoara Provisional School on a full-time basis. However, due to low student numbers, the school was closed in either late 1903 or early 1904.

The WMR was a private company, as the government had decided not to build the line. Higginson also played an important role in the discovery of Dodo bones on the island of Mauritius in 1865. Higginson was born in Thormanby, North Yorkshire, England in 1838 and educated at the Collegiate School, Leicester.  Engineering Life  He was apprenticed to Sir William Fairbairn in Manchester for five years, then constructed railways, canals and water works in Russia 1860‚Äì61, Mauritius 1862‚Äì66, England and India. In India in 1868 he became an associate member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and a member in 1871. In 1872 he was appointed as superintending engineer for railways and public works in the South Island, but in 1878 he left government service and set up in private practice in Dunedin. His work on the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge earned him the Telford Premium of the (British) Institute of Civil Engineers. In 1882 he was given a contract as chief engineer to construct the WMR within five years from 25 September 1862 (the government had completed some works to Johnsonville). He appointed as assistants Arthur Fulton and James Fulton, brothers from Dunedin. The line was completed on 27 October 1886, with the first through train on 3 November. This was nine months early, and Higginson got his promised bonus, in 1890! Higginson then became engineer-manager of the Wellington Gas Works. He died in Wellington on 26 February 1900 aged 63, and was buried in the Karori Cemetery. He is commemorated in a stained glass window at the Wellington Cathedral of St. Paul in New Zealand. The window is decorated with an image of the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge and a Dodo.  Discovery of Dodo Bones  In 1865, whilst working for the Government Staff of the Mauritius Railways, Higginson came upon some workers extracting bones from a swampy morass known as the 'Mare aux Songes'. He records the moment in his ‚ÄòReminiscences of Life and Travel‚Äô3Higginson, Harry Pasley 1891. Reminiscences of Life and Travel 1859-1872. Original manuscript, dated 1891 at Wellington, New Zealand. ‚ÄúShortly before the completion of the railway I was walking along the embankment one morning, when I noticed some [workers] removing some peat soil from a small morass. They were separating and placing into heaps, a number of bones, of various sorts, among the debris. I stopped and examined them, as they appeared to belong to birds and reptiles, and we had always been on the lookout for bones of the then mythical Dodo. So I filled my pocket with the most promising ones for further examination. ‚ÄúA Mr Clarke [sic], the Government schoolmaster in Mahebourg, had Professor Owens‚Äô [sic] book on the Dodo, so I took the bones to him, for comparison with the book plates. The result showed that many of the bones undoubtedly belonged to the Dodo. This was so important a discovery that Clarke [sic] obtained leave to go out to the Morass, and personally superintend the search for more. He eventually dispatched a large quantity to the British Museum, which sold for several hundred pounds. ‚ÄúI sent a box full to the Liverpool, York, and Leeds Museums, from which, in the former, a complete skeleton was erected. This is the only spot in the world where theses bones have been found; and all that are now to be seen in various collections, came out of the same bog, only 200 feet in diameter.‚Äù The Dodo bones are still held by World Museum Liverpool, The Yorkshire Museum and Leeds Museums and Galleries.

A sanatorium for the treatment of infectious diseases was completed in 1879 and the wards were extended in 1895. Four detached villas, designed by Albert Cogswell, were added in 1908. It became the Borough of Portsmouth Mental Hospital in 1914 and was requisitioned for military use during the First World War. After service as an Emergency Medical Service facility during the Second World War, it joined the National Health Service as St James' Hospital in 1948.

She also served as an editor for Mediagazer, a news aggregator website. On 18 April 2019, McKee was fatally shot during rioting in the Creggan area of Derry. Early life and education McKee was born on 31 March 1990 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Her interest in journalism began at fourteen years old when she wrote for the school newspaper at St Gemma's High School. By the following year she joined Children's Express (shortly to be renamed Headliners), a charity that supports young people through helping them develop journalism skills, and through that was awarded the Young Journalist Award by Sky News in 2006. She studied online journalism at Birmingham City University under Paul Bradshaw, pursuing an Master of Arts degree, but did not graduate. She was posthumously awarded an MA in online journalism in January, 2020; her sister, Nichola Corner, accepted the degree on her behalf. Career In 2011, McKee joined the staff of news aggregator Mediagazer, a sister site of technology news aggregator Techmeme. In 2014, she came to wider public attention with the publication of a blog post titled \\"Letter to my 14-year-old self\\" in which she described the challenges of growing up gay in Belfast; it was subsequently made into a short film. McKee's work as a journalist included a number of pieces that appeared in both domestic and international media. Among these were articles she wrote for Mosaic (republished by The Atlantic), The Belfast Telegraph, Private Eye and BuzzFeed News. In 2016 Forbes magazine named her as one of its \\"30 under 30 in media\\" because of her work as an investigative reporter. Publication of her first book, a non-fiction work titled Angels with Blue Faces, was imminent at the time of her death. It deals with the Provisional IRA killing of Belfast MP Robert Bradford. McKee sought crowdfunding to finance its publication, and it was scheduled for publication by Excalibur Press. She subsequently signed a two-book deal with Faber and Faber. At the time of her death, her second book, The Lost Boys, was scheduled for release by Faber in 2020, but remained unfinished. It concerns the disappearances of Thomas Spence and John Rodgers from Belfast's Falls Road in November 1974. Faber and Faber had compared the work to that of Anna Funder's Stasiland and Andy O'Hagan's The Missing. McKee wrote on the consequences of The Troubles. She notably wrote \\"Suicide of the Ceasefire Babies\\", an article on teenage suicides linked to the conflict. At the time of her death, McKee was researching unsolved killings during The Troubles in Northern Ireland of the late 20th century. In March 2019 Irish Times writer Martin Doyle featured McKee in his article \\"Best of Irish: 10 rising stars of Irish writing\\". She gave a TEDx talk, \\"How uncomfortable conversations can save lives\\", at TEDxStormont Women in 2017, about the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2018, she became a trustee of Headliners, the charity that had helped her as a teenager to start her career in journalism. McKee was the partner of Sara Canning, a nurse at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, and had moved to Derry to be with her. After her death it was revealed that she had been planning to propose marriage to Canning, and had purchased an engagement ring.  Death  A PSNI Constable on the Creggan estate shortly after McKee's murder On 18 April 2019, McKee was shot during rioting in the Creggan area of Derry, Northern Ireland. Violence broke out after police raids on dissidents with the aim of seizing munitions ahead of the Easter Rising commemorative parades due to take place in the area that weekend. The disturbances were centred on Fanad Drive. Youths threw petrol bombs and burnt two vehicles. Police said that a gunman then fired up to twelve shots towards police officers. McKee, who was on Fanad Drive and standing near an armoured police Land Rover, was wounded in the head. Mobile phone footage and police CCTV footage shows a masked gunman, believed to be a member of the New IRA, opening fire with a handgun. McKee was taken by police, in an armoured Land Rover, to Altnagelvin Area Hospital, where she later died. Police blamed dissident republicans for her death. The last time a journalist was killed in the UK was the 2001 assassination of Martin O'Hagan. She was survived by her partner, mother, two brothers and three sisters. McKee's funeral took place at the Anglican St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast, on 24 April. It was attended by British Prime Minister Theresa May, Irish President Michael D. Higgins, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, DUP leader Arlene Foster, Sinn F√©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and Vice President Michelle O'Neill, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour. McKee's coffin was met with applause from the waiting public as it arrived at the cathedral. =Consequences of her death= British Prime Minister Theresa May called the murder \\"shocking and senseless\\", saying McKee \\"died doing her job with great courage\\". Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said \\"our solidarity also goes out to the people of Derry and to the entire journalism community. We cannot allow those who want to propagate violence, fear and hate to drag us back to the past.\\" The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, said \\"the loss of a journalist at any time in any part of the world is an attack on truth itself.\\" Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, who had visited Derry only a few hours before the events, also condemned the murder. The attack was condemned by religious leaders of many denominations, including Ken Good, Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe; Diarmuid Martin, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin; Donal McKeown, Catholic Bishop of Derry; and Charles McMullen, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. Other public figures to express condolences include Karen Bradley, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; and former US President Bill Clinton. S√©amus Dooley, assistant general secretary of the National Union of Journalists in Northern Ireland described her as \\"a journalist of courage, style and integrity\\". The leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties, the DUP, Sinn F√©in, UUP, SDLP, Alliance Party and Green Party, released a joint statement condemning the killing of McKee and described it as \\"an attack on all the people of this community, an attack on the peace and democratic processes\\". They also said that it was a \\"pointless and futile act to destroy the progress made over the last 20 years, which has the overwhelming support of people everywhere\\". They further reiterated their support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who were the intended targets of the gun attack. A vigil at the site of her killing held on 19 April was attended by Colum Eastwood, Arlene Foster, Naomi Long and Mary Lou McDonald. A second vigil was held in Belfast City Hall, and was attended by author Anna Burns and John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, an LGBT rights charity in Northern Ireland. The investigative website Bellingcat published an \\"Open Source Survey\\" of the shooting. The same day the police had arrested two men, aged 18 and 19, on suspicion of involvement in McKee's murder. They were released without charge the following day. On 23 April, The Irish News published an article claiming that the New IRA had admitted responsibility for the killing. The group stated that McKee wasn't the objective of the attack and offered its apologies to McKee's family and partner. On the same day police arrested a 57-year-old woman in connection with the murder; she was later released unconditionally. On 25 April, the crime prevention charity Crimestoppers offered a reward of up to ¬£10,000 for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the killing. On 1 May the PSNI confirmed it would offer anonymity to any witnesses who came forward with information. McKee, and her friends' attempt to get a conviction after her death, are the subject of a documentary film, The Real Derry Girls, made by Peter Taylor for the BBC. Leona O‚ÄôNeill, a fellow Derry journalist who witnessed and wrote about McKee's killing, later received online threats, alleging that she was responsible, or had invented her account of the shooting. On 11 February 2020, four men, aged 20, 27, 29 and 52, were arrested under the Terrorism Act in Derry. A 52-year-old man was charged with McKee's murder the following day. In early June 2020, the murder weapon, a H√§mmerli X-Esse .22 LR pistol, was recovered by police from the Ballymagroarty area of Derry.

The GP2/08 was the 2nd generation car used by the GP2 Series, replacing the GP2/05, which had also been developed by Dallara. The GP2/08 was used from 2008 to 2010, in keeping with the series philosophy of introducing a chassis every 3 years. As the GP2 Series is a spec formula, the car was utilised by all teams and drivers in the championship.  Development  Planning and design of the car began in September 2006, with GP2 series Technical Director Didier Perrin laying down the initial design parameters, prior to handing over the detailed design work to Dallara, with it being decided relatively earlier that the partnerships from the first three years of GP2 would be continued until at least 2010, with a chassis by Dallara, Renault branded engine and gearbox by Mecachrome and tyres by Bridgestone. The car was also designed to be upgradable, with an upgrade kit to be issued each year, to keep up with changes in Formula 1. The car featured a new and 'aggressively low' nose, alongside a single keel suspension and a sculpted front wing. The car had re- designed sidepods, the which were result of a new radiator and cooling set-up. The barge-boards are also noticeably different, being far larger and more sculpted than their predecessor. The rear end was also completely redesigned, with the contoured engine cover fitting over the Mecachrome-built V8 being far tighter than before, and while the rear of the sidepods featured both brand new cooling chimneys and a newer design of the 'shark gill' vents which appeared briefly in 2006. The rear point of the engine cover pulls down to a markedly different, and far neater, exhaust assembly, while the rear wing is a brand new development of that seen in 2007 The car also came with anti intrusion panels, and was designed to meet F1 crash test standards of the time, being the only non-F1 car to pass the 2007 Formula One Crash test. The car had its initial shakedown at the Paul Ricard High Speed Test Track on 26 June 2007 by Nelson Piquet Jnr, who was the runner up in the previous season, completing 60 laps without any problems. The car was also launched on that day.

For theories about the development of morality in individuals, see moral development. Moral progress refers to improvement in concepts such as moral beliefs and practices experienced on a societal scale. Moody-Adams noted that \\"moral progress in belief involves deepening our grasp of existing moral concepts, while moral progress in practices involves realizing deepened moral understandings in behavior or social institutions\\".  Definitions  Allen Buchanan defined moral progress as \\"morally progressive changes in social practices and institutions\\"... movement towards some morally desirable condition or state of affairs\\". Michele Moody-Adams defined local moral progress as \\"coming to appreciate more fully the richness and the range of applications of a particular moral concept\\", or developing a new one, and the spread of \\"practices embodying deepened understanding of justice and related moral notions\\"; in other words, a deepening of our grasp of moral concepts. Another view is that moral progress is \\"a greater success in describing moral reality\\". Moral progress on a societal scale should not be confused with moral development in individuals, occasionally also referred to as moral progress.  Aspects  Moral progress in societies leads to moral progress in individual beliefs throughout said society. Understanding morality is also not required, once governments decide to implement moral progress notions, and do so through various incentives. This can lead to the faster progress in moral progress in practices than in the moral progress in beliefs; in other words, with external pressures, individuals and organizations may behave better not because of their inherent beliefs, but because of considerations of social and enlightened self-interest. Buchanan differentiates between improvements from a moral point of view, which are caused by external factors, some possibly independent of human motivation and agency, and genuine moral progress. However, he notes that the former generally leads to the later anyway. Moral progress in the last few centuries has been often the result of the actions of morally progressive social movements who attempt to popularize new morals. Measurement of universal moral progress is difficult, because there is no universal consensus in regards to the final destination, nor objective standards of ethics. Most complex moral concepts have more than a single established definition. This makes measuring moral progress even more difficult from measuring human progress in general. Measurement of local, more specific moral progress are easier, as it is simpler to reach consensus on local, more specific ethical issues. As Musschenga and Meyned noted, \\"Most contemporary Dutchmen will agree that the Netherlands since the 16th century made moral progress. It is doubtful whether Dutchmen from the 16th century would also agree.\\" Jeremy Evans, however, made an argument that is should be possible to create a definition of moral progress that \\"relies on a correlation between increasing population welfare... and ethical advancement\\".  Types of moral progress  Buchanan provides a typology of moral progress: * better compliance with valid moral norms, * better moral concepts, * better understanding of the virtues, * better moral motivation, * better moral reasoning, * proper demoralization, * proper moralization, * better understanding of moral standing and moral statuses, * improvements in the understanding of the nature of morality, and *better understanding of justice. Social scientist Jacy Reese Anthis has argued for \\"moral circle expansion\\" as an important metric of moral progress and as an approach to bettering the long-term future for all sentient beings. His organization, the Sentience Institute, researches moral circle expansion via studying historical and current examples of moral progress, such as the British antislavery movement.  Examples  Buchanan called the modern human rights movement \\"the most robust instance of [moral] progress\\" Other examples of moral progress include: * improvement in the treatment of all individuals in the form of the abolition of slavery, reduction of racism and violent crimes like homicides, spread of political enfranchisement (right to vote), and other human rights like religious tolerance and freedom of expression, and the abolition of many cruel punishments, *improvement in the treatment of women in the form of the development and spread of women's rights and gender equality, *progress in international relations through the emergence of international norms discouraging or prohibiting behaviors such as wars and colonialism.
