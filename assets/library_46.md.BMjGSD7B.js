It is an unconsolidated deposit lying in a bedrock valley formerly occupied by the ancestral Mississippi River. Type locality The sand which forms the Sankoty aquifer was named after a railroad siding near Peoria, Illinois in 1946 by Leland Horberg. The legal description given by Horberg in identifying the type locality for the Sankoty sand is T9N, R8E, Section 15 (Peoria County, Illinois).  Lithology and stratigraphy  The Sankoty sand is an unconsolidated deposit within a bedrock valley formerly occupied by the ancestral Mississippi River. It is classified as a member of the Banner Formation and occupies the same stratigraphic position as the Mahomet sand. The Sankoty sand has distinctive characteristics that are readily recognized in sample cuttings. In its most typical aspect, the Sankoty is composed of 70 to 90 percent quartz grains of which 25 percent or more are pink, rounded, and polished. The texture is usually medium-grained but varies from silty fine sand to coarse gravelly sand. Groundwater occurrence The Sankoty sand is one of the most extensive aquifers in the state. It frequently is thick and is typically found below elevations of 520 to 530 feet above sea level. It has been used as a water source in the Peoria area since at least 1892. By 1909, it was observed that groundwater levels at the North Field in Peoria fluctuated with the river stage in the Illinois River. The Sankoty aquifer extends beyond the width of the Illinois River valley and occurs beneath the uplands. In these locations, it is frequently confined by clayey deposits of glacial till (which may include other sands). Consequently, the groundwater may occur under confined (artesian) conditions. Groundwater pumping has altered historical groundwater flow in the Sankoty aquifer. The flat geography of the area leads to groundwater flows that are perpendicular to the Illinois River, however municipal groundwater pumping in the Peoria, Illinois area and to a lesser degree agricultural pumping elsewhere over the aquifer has led to numerous cones of depression.

Made before M*A*S*H, the film was subject to re-editing by the studio.Pym 2004, p. 242. Countdown stars James Caan and Robert Duvall as astronauts vying to be the first American to walk on the Moon as part of a crash program to beat the Soviet Union.Maltin 2012, p. 288. Plot In the late 1960s, astronauts training in an Apollo simulator have their session ended early. They grumble about it, but their commander, Chiz (Robert Duvall), knows the reason for the abort: the Pilgrim Program. The Russians will be sending a Moon landing mission up in four weeks. The Americans had a secret alternate plan to the Apollo program, the fictional program Pilgrim, in case this happened. One man would be sent to the Moon in a one-way rocket (depicted in the film as a Titan II), using a modified Project Gemini craft. He would stay on the Moon for a few months in a shelter pod launched and landed before him. Later, a manned Apollo mission would come to retrieve him. The equipment is ready, but the Russians complicate matters by sending up a civilian. Chiz, although trained and qualified, is an Air Force colonel. NASA and the White House insist that an American civilian be their first man on the Moon. Lee (James Caan), one of Chiz's crew, is tapped. Chiz is outraged, but agrees to train Lee in the few days they have. Chiz pushes Lee's training hard, half to get him ready, half hoping he will drop out and Chiz can step in. Lee persists, driven by the same astronaut dream. After a press leak about Pilgrim, the Russians launch a week early. Deflated at not being first, everyone carries on. The shelter pod (a LEM lander) is launched and landed successfully. Lee is launched on schedule. He encounters a power drain malfunction en route which tests his character and hinders radio contact. The Russians have also lost contact with their team. As Lee orbits the Moon, he does not see the beacon of the shelter. With only seconds left before he must abort and return to Earth, he lies about seeing it. Mission Control okays his retro burn and he lands. Now all radio contact is lost. Lee gets out of the Gemini lander and walks around with one hour of oxygen in his suit. He finds the crashed Russian lander on its side, the three dead cosmonauts sprawled around it. Everyone on Earth is nervously awaiting news, but none comes. Lee takes the Soviet flag from a dead cosmonaut and lays it on a nearby rock with his own American flag. With little air left and nowhere to go, Lee spins the toy mouse his son gave him. It points right, so he walks in that direction. People on Earth are losing hope as his time has run out. Lee looks at his watch to see that he has just minutes of air left. A red glow on his arm catches his attention. It is the locator beacon atop the shelter. Lee is last seen walking towards the shelter... towards survival.

The standard route up Quandary Peak is a trail hike (class 1), starting from a trailhead about north of Hoosier Pass on the east side of the peak. Hence it is a popular fourteener to climb because of the relatively easy ascent and its proximity to Denver and Breckenridge. Quandary Peak is also popular with backcountry skiers and snowboarders. The gentle ascent makes for an easy climb from the east with less danger from avalanche than on many other fourteeners. The other slopes of the peak are steep and appeal to expert backcountry skiers.

In 2013, a Texas Court of Appeals panel acquitted DeLay when it overturned his conviction. This decision was affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on October 1, 2014. DeLay had three years from that date, i.e. until October 1, 2017, to file any lawsuits for wrongful action. Ronnie Earle, the Democratic then-District Attorney of Travis County (which includes the state capital of Austin), sought the indictment of Tom DeLay in 2005. After a first grand jury declined to indict DeLay, Earle stated that new evidence had become available. A second grand jury quickly issued an indictment of Delay for one count of criminal conspiracy on September 28, 2005. On October 3, a third grand jury indicted DeLay for the more serious offense of money laundering. An arrest warrant was issued on October 19, and DeLay turned himself in the next day to the Harris County Sheriff's Office in Houston.\\"Smiling DeLay turns himself in for booking\\", CNN, October 21, 2005. In accordance with House Republican Conference rules, DeLay temporarily resigned from his position as House Majority Leader.

On June 9, 2006, DeLay resigned from Congress.Jonathan Weisman and Chris Cillizza, \\"DeLay to Resign From Congress\\", Washington Post, April 4, 2006. After two judges were recused from the case, the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court assigned Senior District Judge Pat Priest, a Democrat, of San Antonio to preside over the case.\\"San Antonio judge assigned to hear DeLay case\\" , CNN, November 4, 2005. DeLay moved to dismiss all charges. Judge Priest dismissed one count of the indictment alleging conspiracy to violate election law but allowed the other, more serious charges of money laundering and conspiracy to engage in money laundering to proceed. In November 2010, DeLay was found guilty by a Travis County jury on both counts. In September 2013, a Texas appeals court, composed of two Republicans and a dissenting Democrat, overturned DeLay's conviction. In the opinion of the court, the state's evidence was legally insufficient to sustain DeLay's convictions so the court reversed the judgments of the trial court and rendered judgments of acquittal. The current DA's office said it would appeal the decision to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which it later did.Wiggins, Mark, \\"Lehmberg vows appeal after DeLay conviction overturned\\", KVUE.com, September 19, 2013; retrieved September 23, 2013.DeLay v.

Retrieved May 31, 2019. Background In the reapportionment following the 1990 Census, Texas Democrats drew what Republican political analyst Michael Barone argued was the most effective partisan gerrymander in the country. The Democrats won 70 percent of the Texas congressional seats in 1992, the first year in which the new districts were in effect, while taking half of the total number of votes cast for Congress statewide. After the 2000 census, Republicans sought to redraw the district lines to support a Republican majority in the congressional delegation while Democrats desired to retain a plan similar to the existing lines. The two parties reached an impasse in the Texas Legislature, where Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the House. As a result the new district lines were drawn by a three judge federal court panel that made as few changes as possible while adding the two new seats. In 2001 the Texas Legislative Redistricting Board (a panel composed of the state's Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Speaker of the state House, Attorney General, and Land Commissioner) redrew state legislative districts in accordance with the Census results. The new map that was adopted by the Republican-dominated board gave the Republicans an edge in winning the Texas House of Representatives, still controlled at that time by the Democrats. During the 2002 elections under these new maps, DeLay aggressively raised money for Republican candidates under Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC). In October 2002, TRMPAC made contributions, through several channels, to Nelson Balido of San Antonio ($2,000), Byron Cook of Corsicana ($2,000), Wayne Christian of Center ($2,000), Rick Green of Dripping Springs ($2,000), and Eddie Shauberger of Liberty ($2,000), among others. The GOP victories in 2002 resulted in their control of the Texas House in addition to the Senate. As a result, the Texas Legislature was called into session in 2003 to establish a controversial mid- decade redistricting plan that favored Republicans. A number of Democrats (the \\"Killer Ds\\", in the state House, and \\"Texas Eleven\\" in the state Senate) left the state and went to Oklahoma and later New Mexico to deny a quorum for voting. Helen Giddings, the recognized negotiator, was arrested in May 2003, but later the arrest was called a mistake. The political police dragnet was at taxpayer expense.\\"Homeland Security Dept. Searches for Texas Democrats\\", truthout.org; accessed August 21, 2014. Texas House Speaker Craddick apologized to Giddings, then ordered the Sergeant at Arms to incarcerate Giddings in the state capital building. On May 26, 2005, a Texas judge ruled that a committee formed by DeLay had violated state law by not disclosing over $600,000 worth of fundraising money, mostly from the credit card industry, including $25,000 from Sears, Roebuck & Co.,Working Class News; accessed August 21, 2014. and $50,000 from Diversified Collections Services of San Leandro. Some of the money was spent on manning phone banks and posting wanted posters on Federal Highways calling for the arrest of Democratic legislators with an 800 number to the Texas Department of Public Safety to call if seen after the Democratic caucus left for Oklahoma in order to prevent the redistricting legislation from passing. The Federal Highway Administration offered to cooperate in arresting the Democrats, forcing the Democrats to travel to Oklahoma by plane instead of by automobile. Five Texas congressional seats changed hands from Democrats to Republicans during the 2004 election, largely due to the new redistricting. On October 6, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay on two counts. The first count stated that DeLay \\"created the appearance that donors were being provided with special access to Representative DeLay regarding the then-pending energy legislation.\\" The second count alleged DeLay had \\"used federal resources in a political issue\\" by asking the Federal Aviation Administration and Justice Department to help track Texas legislators during the battle over Texas redistricting.DeLay Memo; accessed August 21, 2014. At the time of the latter admonishment, the House Ethics committee deferred action on another count related to fundraising while that matter was subject to state criminal action. That state investigation eventually led to the felony indictment on September 28, 2005. In 2005, the Federal Elections Commission audited DeLay's national political action committee, Americans for a Republican Majority (ARMPAC). The FEC found that ARMPAC had failed to report $322,306 in debts owed to vendors, and that it had incorrectly paid for some committee expenses using funds from an account designated for non-federal elections. The FEC also found that ARMPAC had misstated the balances of its receipts and ending cash-on-hand for 2001, and of its receipts, disbursements, and beginning and ending cash-on- hand for 2002. ARMPAC corrected the omission of the debts in amended reports, and is reviewing the portion of the audit dealing with incorrect payment for expenses. DeLay asserted that Earle was \\"a rogue district attorney\\" engaged in \\"blatant political partisanship\\". Earle retired in December 2007 and was succeeded by Rosemary Lehmberg, whom he mentored.Charles Babington, \\"Earle Has Prosecuted Many Democrats\\", Washington Post, September 29, 2005. Grand jury indictments *September 8, 2005: A federal grand jury indicted TRMPAC, which allegedly accepted an illegal political contribution of $100,000 from the Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care and the Texas Association of Business, on four charges, including unlawful political advertising, unlawful contributions to a political committee and unlawful expenditures such as those to a graphics company and political candidates. *September 28, 2005: A Travis County grand jury operating under Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law stemming from issues dealing with his involvement in TRMPAC. Texas law prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that TRMPAC accepted corporate contributions, laundered the money through the Republican National Committee, and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. *September 30, 2005: In response to a motion to dismiss his initial indictment, Earle sought a second indictment of DeLay from a second grand jury. That jury refused to indict. Contrary to normal Texas procedure, a \\"no bill\\" document was not publicly released, and no public announcement was made regarding the result until after Earle had presented evidence to a third grand jury and obtained an indictment. *October 3, 2005: Earle sought and received a new indictment of DeLay from a third grand jury in Austin on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. The next day, in a written statement, Earle publicly admitted he had presented the case to three grand juries, and that two of the three had refused to indict. Earle claimed he had presented the new money-laundering charge to another grand jury because the previous grand jury had expired. DeLay's lawyers noted that Earle should not have waited to make the statement until after 5 p.m. that day. *October 3, 2005: DeLay's lawyers filed a motion to throw out the charge of conspiracy to violate election law as fraudulent, claiming it was a violation of the U.S. Constitution's ban on ex-post facto applications of law. DeLay's lawyers argued that, in 2002, the crime of conspiracy did not apply to Texas election law. However, George Dix, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, stated that charges of criminal conspiracy could legally be applied to any felony (including violation of election law) committed prior to the 2003 law. He characterized the 2003 change cited by DeLay's lawyers as a clarification of existing law, saying, \\"It isn't unheard of ‚Äî the Legislature passing a law to make clear what the law is.\\" As the Texas Penal Code defines laundered money only as money gained as the \\"proceeds of criminal activity\\",Tex. Penal Code sec. 34.02. DeLay's lawyers maintained that misuse of corporate donations, even if it occurred, could not constitute money laundering. *October 7, 2005: DeLay's attorneys filed a motion in court to have the latest indictment thrown out, charging that Earle coerced the grand jury and illegally discussed grand jury information and encouraged others to do the same. *October 19, 2005: A Texas court issued a warrant for DeLay's arrest.Janice Porter. Capias issued October 19, 2005. DeLay surrendered at the Harris County, Texas jail the next day. He was booked, photographed, and fingerprinted, before posting $10,000 bond. *October 21, 2005: DeLay appeared in court. *November 1, 2005: DeLay prevailed in a motion to remove assigned Travis County judge Bob Perkins from the case. Perkins had donated to Democratic candidates and organizations, including MoveOn.org. DeLay's attorneys argued Perkins could not be perceived as impartial under the circumstances.

Duncan ordered Perkins' removal from the case. DeLay also sought to have the venue changed from Democratic-leaning Travis County, which was later denied. *November 3, 2005: Pat Priest, a \\"semi-retired\\" judge and a Democrat, was selected to preside over the case. *November 22, 2005: DeLay filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him. *December 5, 2005: Judge Priest dismissed one count, conspiracy to violate election law, but let stand two counts alleging money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, of which DeLay was later convicted on November 24, 2010. *April 19, 2006: The Texas Third Court of Appeals upheld the decision to dismiss the charge of conspiracy to violate election law. *September 19, 2013: DeLay's November 2010 convictions were overturned by the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals, which noted in part that \\"the jury on two occasions had asked trial Judge Pat Priest whether the $190,000 was 'illegal at the start of the transaction' or 'procured by illegal means originally'\\" and that \\"the judge never answered the jurors' questions\\". *October 1, 2014: The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled 8-1 to uphold the decisions of the lower courts, exonerating DeLay.Texas Judiciary Online - HTML Opinion, cca.courts.state.tx.us; accessed October 1, 2014. =Indictments of associates= On September 13, 2005, a federal grand jury indicted ARMPAC's executive director Jim Ellis and TRMPAC's former executive director John Colyandro, who already faced charges of money laundering in the case, as well as 13 counts of unlawful acceptance of a corporate political contribution. The charges were brought before the grand jury by Earle. Joe Turner, who represented Colyandro, stated he did not want a jury trial in Austin, because \\"DeLay and Republicans are hated [there]\\". The indictment charged that DeLay, Colyandro and Ellis conspired to pass corporate contributions to candidates for the Texas legislature in violation of Texas campaign finance law. Several corporations (such as Diversified Collection Services and Sears Roebuck) allegedly made contributions to TRMPAC. The indictment charged that TRMPAC then sent a check for $190,000 to the Republican National Committee, made payable to \\"RNSEC\\" (the Republican National State Elections Committee), along with a list of state-level Republican candidates who should receive the money. According to the indictment, the Republican candidates in Texas did receive the money so designated. A Travis County grand jury issued the indictment. The third grand jury's foreman, William Gibson, stated that there were \\"stacks and stacks\\" [of evidence] and that \\"[A]s far as we're concerned, they presented us enough evidence and witnesses that we felt we were on the right track. I would not have put my name on that grand-jury indictment unless I felt we had ample probable cause.\\" Gibson, however, later reportedly told KLBJ Radio in an interview that his decision to indict DeLay was based on news stories that the Texas Association of Business mailings against candidate James Spencer, a personal friend of Gibson, were coordinated with TRMPAC. Earle's investigation of DeLay was the subject of a documentary, The Big Buy: Tom DeLay's Stolen Congress.The Big Buy: Tom DeLay's Stolen Congress, tomdelaymovie.com; accessed August 21, 2014. The filmmakers went to cover the 2003 Texas redistricting battle but eventually focused primarily on the grand jury investigation. Earle cooperated with the documentarians, but DeLay refused to meet with them. =DeLay's response to the indictments= DeLay blasted the charges as a \\"sham\\" and an act of \\"political retribution\\", perpetuated by his political opponents. He added, \\"I have done nothing wrong, I have violated no law, no regulation, no rule of the House.\\" He retained former U.S. Representative Edwin Bethune of Arkansas, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and lobbyist, who had earlier represented Gingrich during his ethics cases. DeLay and his attorney, Dick DeGuerin, claimed Earle has a history of indicting political enemies. Due to Republican party rules regarding leadership and indictments, DeLay stepped down from his position as House Majority Leader. Serving his last day on June 9, 2006, he stepped down, \\"to pursue new opportunities to engage in the important cultural and political battles of our day from an arena outside of the U.S. House of Representatives.\\"DeLay to leave office on June 9, Associated Press (May 12, 2006). White House spokesman Scott McClellan commented by saying that President Bush still viewed DeLay as \\"a good ally, a leader who we have worked closely with to get things done for the American people.\\" On January 7, 2006, DeLay announced he would not seek to return to his position as Majority Leader. His lawyers asserted there were various legal insufficiencies regarding the indictments. On October 3, 2005, DeLay's lawyers filed a motion to get the indictment of conspiracy to violate election law thrown out as fraudulent, claiming it was a violation of the U.S. Constitution's ban on ex-post facto applications of law. DeLay's lawyers claimed that, in 2002, the crime of conspiracy did not apply to Texas election law, and maintained the corporate donations came from normal and legal business activity. Verdict and appeals On November 24, 2010, DeLay was found guilty by a Travis County jury on both counts. The range of possible sentences was probation to between 5 and 99 years in prison and up to $20,000 in fines.James McKinley, Jr., \\"DeLay Is Convicted in Texas Donation Case\\", New York Times, November 24, 2010. On January 10, 2011, after a sentencing hearing, Judge Priest sentenced DeLay to three years in prison on the charge of conspiring to launder corporate money into political donations. On the charge of money laundering, DeLay was sentenced to five years in prison, which was probated for 10 years, meaning DeLay would have had to serve 10 years' probation. Dick DeGuerin, DeLay's defense attorney, appealed his conviction to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which heard oral arguments on October 10, 2012.Laylan Copelin, \\"DeLay sentenced to 3 years in prison\\", Austin American- Statesman, January 10, 2011. On September 19, 2013, two Republican judges on a Texas appeals court overturned Delay's convictions, 2-1, ruling the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his convictions. The Travis County District Attorney's office issued a statement that it would appeal the decision before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which it did.

He was a son of the founding emperor Murong Chui (Emperor Wucheng) and a brother of Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin), and when his brother's empire was under threat from the rival Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui, he tried to save it, but was killed by his nephew Murong Hui, intent on seizing power from both his father and his uncles. Before Later Yan's founding The first reference to Murong Long in history was in 369, when Murong Chui, then a Former Yan prince, fled to Former Qin after he came after suspicion of the emperor Murong Wei's mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun and the regent Murong Ping; Murong Long was one of his sons who fled with him. When Murong Chui subsequently resolved to rebel against Former Qin after its emperor Fu JiƒÅn was defeated at the Battle of Fei River in his attempt to conquer Jin and reunite China, Murong Long was involved in his first act of rebellion ‚Äî massacring the Di soldiers that Murong Chui's deputy, Fu Feilong (ËãªÈ£õÈæç), commanded. Murong Chui subsequently declared the independence of Later Yan in 384. During Murong Chui's reign Throughout the next few years, Murong Long largely served as a general directly under his father's command, as Later Yan tried to establish itself over the old territory of Former Yan. In 384, when Murong Chui was nearly trapped by an ambush by the Former Qin viceroy Fu Pi, Murong Long was the one who rescued him from the encounter. In 386, Murong Chui created him the Prince of Gaoyang. He continued to distinguish himself in campaigns against independent warlords and Jin generals. In 389, when his brother Murong Nong, himself a distinguished general, was recalled from his post as viceroy at the old Former Yan capital Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), Murong Long replaced him as viceroy, and he followed Murong Nong's policies. The populace favored him as much as Murong Nong. During Murong Chui's reign, Murong Nong and Murong Long were the most well-regarded princes. Because of this, Murong Chui's wife Empress Duan Yuanfei once suggested to him that the crown prince Murong Bao lacked abilities to govern, and Murong Chui should choose either Murong Nong or Murong Long instead. Murong Chui, believing Murong Bao to be capable, rejected her suggestion. Around the new year 396, after an army commanded by Murong Bao had suffered a crushing defeat by Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui at the Battle of Canhe Slope, Murong Chui planned a second campaign against Northern Wei, and he recalled Murong Long and his troops back to the capital Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei), replacing him as viceroy with Murong Bao's son Murong Hui the Duke of Qinghe. With Murong Long's fresh troops leading the way and with Murong Long and Murong Nong as forward commanders, the campaign against Northern Wei was initially successful, but as the army passed through Canhe Slope, they mourned in such a great manner that Murong Chui, in shame and anger, grew ill, and the army was forced to retreat. He died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Murong Bao. During Murong Bao's reign Murong Bao, although aware of Empress Duan's earlier suggestion to make Murong Nong or Murong Long crown prince (and in fact was so resentful of it that he forced her to commit suicide), appeared to trust his brothers greatly. However, in fall 396, Northern Wei launched a major campaign against Later Yan, and Tuoba Gui, after defeating Murong Nong and seizing Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern central and northern Shanxi), then advanced against Zhongshan. Murong Bao put another brother, Murong Lin the Prince of Zhao, in charge of Zhongshan's defenses, and Murong Lin advocated the strategy of defending the city and not engaging Northern Wei, much to Murong Long and Murong Nong's frustration. In spring 397, after Murong Lin failed in a coup attempt, he fled out of the capital, and Murong Bao, in fear that Murong Lin would seize a relief force commanded by his son Murong Hui the Prince of Qinghe, decided to abandon Zhongshan. Murong Nong's and Murong Long's subordinates tried to persuade each to stay in Zhongshan rather than to follow Murong Bao, but each refused, feeling that loyalty to their brother required them to follow him. They therefore followed Murong Bao and joined Murong Hui's army. However, Murong Hui was resentful that he was not made crown prince, a position given to his younger brother Murong Ce (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ≠ñ), and he considered seizing the position by force. Murong Bao, realizing this, tried to transfer some of Murong Hui's army to the commands of Murong Nong and Murong Long, but this only made Murong Hui more resentful, and he acted first against his uncles, sending assassins against them. Murong Long was killed, but Murong Nong survived the attack but was severely wounded (described as having suffered a wound so deep that his brain was visible), and Murong Hui, who then openly declared a coup, was then defeated and killed.

Dual-covenant or two-covenant theology is a school of thought in Christianity regarding the relevance of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians call the Old Testament. Most Christians hold that the Old Testament has been superseded or abrogated and replaced with the New Covenant, which is the only one of the biblical covenants that remains valid today. Dual-covenant theology is unique in holding that the Old Covenant or the Law of Moses remains valid for Jews while the New Covenant only applies to non-Jews or gentiles. Background Judaism maintains that in the post-flood era there is a universally binding covenant between God and man in the form of the Seven Laws of NoahBT Sanhedrin 57aMishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:14Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry Ben Noah, end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote and that there is additionally a unique Sinaitic covenant that was made between God and the Hebrews at biblical Mount Sinai. However Judaism has not historically maintained that there is a separate covenant for gentiles wherein they should convert to Christianity. Indeed from the Maimonidean perspective, belief in the divinity of Jesus would be a breach of Noahide Law.Maimonides, Peirush HaMishnha on Avodah Zarah 1.3, and his rulings in Hilchos Avoda Zarah 9:4, Hilchos Ma'achalos Asuros 11:7 and Hilchos Melachim 11:4 The 18th-century rabbinic thinker Yaakov Emden has even opined: :‚Äú...the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the seven moral laws of Noah and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law ‚Äî which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the laws of Moses and the Sabbath.‚ÄùAppendix to \\"Seder 'Olam\\" pp. 32b-34b, Hamburg, 1752 as cited in the Jewish Encyclopedia under the entry Gentile Later on the 20th century unorthodox Jewish theologian Franz Rosenzweig, consequent to his flirtations with Christianity, advanced the idea in his work the Star of Redemption that ‚ÄúChristianity acknowledges the God of the Jews, not as God but as ‚Äúthe Father of Jesus Christ.‚Äù Christianity itself cleaves to the ‚ÄúLord‚Äù because it knows that the Father can be reached only through him....We are all wholly agreed as to what Christ and his church mean to the world: no one can reach the Father save through him. No one can reach the Father! But the situation is quite different for one who does not have to reach the Father because he is already with him. And this is true of the people of Israel.‚ÄùNahum N. Glatzer, Franz Rosenzweig: His Life and Thought (New York: Schocken Books, 1961), p. 341. Daniel Goldhagen, former Associate Professor of Political Science at Harvard University, also suggested in his book A Moral Reckoning that the Roman Catholic Church should change its doctrine and the Biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic, to indicate that \\"The Jews' way to God is as legitimate as the Christian way\\". Messianic Judaism David H. Stern, a Messianic Jewish theologian, wrote that dual-covenant theology is said to originate with Maimonides. It was proffered in the 20th century by the Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig, and was elaborated upon by such theologians as Reinhold Niebuhr and James Parkes. These founders believe that Jesus' message is not for Jews but for Gentiles and, that is to be understood thusly: \\"I am the way, the truth and the life; and no Gentile comes to the father except through me.\\"David H. Stern, \\"Jewish New Testament Commentary\\", page 196, Jewish New Testament Publications, Inc., 1992. Stern asserts that the problem of dual-covenant theology is that \\"replacing Yeshua‚Äôs 'No one comes to the Father except through me' with 'No Gentile comes...' does unacceptable violence to the plain sense of the text and to the whole New Testament.\\" Apostolic Decree James the Just, whose judgment was adopted in the Apostolic Decree of , c. 50 AD: \\"we should write to them [Gentiles] to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood...\\" (NRSV) The Apostolic Decree in the Book of Acts () has been commonly interpreted as a parallel to Noahide Law.The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries), Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), , chapter V Although the Apostolic Decree is no longer observed by many Christian denominations today, it is still observed in full by the Greek Orthodox.Karl Josef von Hefele's commentary on canon II of Gangra notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws.\\" Opinion of Pope John Paul II Traditional supersessionist theology, as exemplified in Pope Eugene IV's papal bull, which he published at the Council of Florence in 1441: John Paul II supported greater dialogue between Catholics and Jews, but did not explicitly support dual-covenant theology. On November 17, 1980, John Paul II delivered a speech to the Jews of Berlin in which he discussed his views of Catholic‚ÄìJewish relations. In it, John Paul II asserted that God's covenant with the Jewish people was never revoked. During the speech, John Paul II cited Nostra Aetate, claiming that Catholics \\"will endeavor to understand better all that in the Old Testament preserves a proper and perpetual value ..., since this value has not been obliterated by the further interpretation of the New Testament, which on the contrary gave the Older its most complete meaning, so that the New one receives from the Old light and explanation .\\"Meeting of John Paul II with the Representatives of the Jewish Community, Mainz, Section 3, Google translation, 17 November 1980, https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/it/speeches/1980/november/documents/hf_jp_ii_spe_19801117_ebrei- magonza.html Criticism A major theme of Paul's Epistle to the Romans is said to be that, so far as salvation is concerned, Jews and Gentiles are equal before God (2:7-12; 3:9-31; 4:9-12; 5:12,17-19; 9:24; 10:12-13; 11:30-32). Romans 1:16, by stating that the Gospel is the same for Jew and Gentile, may present a serious problem for dual-covenant theology.David H. Stern: \\"Jewish New Testament Commentary\\", page 329. Jewish New Testament Publications, Inc., 1992. is sometimes cited as a verse supporting dual- covenant theology. A problem with this argument, however, is the context of Galatians 5. Galatians 5:4 in particular, says, \\"You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.\\" Line this up with Galatians 2, Galatians 2:21 in particular, which says ‚ÄúI do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.‚Äù Scholars still debate the meaning of the Pauline phrase \\"Works of the Law\\" (see New Perspective on Paul and Federal Vision). A similar challenge is presented by Galatians 2:15 and 16, just after the Incident at Antioch, in which Paul says (speaking to Peter, a fellow Jew), ‚ÄúWe are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\\" The same exclusive claims for the Christian message are also made by other writers. John 14:6 states, \\"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.'\\" Peter, speaking to fellow Jews about Jesus in Acts 4:12, says: \\"And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.\\" The First Epistle of John states, \\"Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist‚Äîhe denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.\\"1 John 2:22-23, NIV, This does not differentiate between Jews or Gentiles, giving an argument of evidence of absence. =Catholic= Cardinal Avery Dulles was critical of dual-covenant theology, especially as understood in the USCCB's document Reflections on Covenant and Mission.Covenant and Mission In the article All in the Family: Christians, Jews and God, evidence has also been compiled from Scripture, the Church Fathers and official Church documents that the Catholic Church does not support dual covenant theology.Forrest and Palm; All in the Family: Christians, Jews and God; Lay Witness, July/Aug 2009; Though it is to be removed from the next edition (at order of the Vatican, as misrepresenting the editio typica) the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults (2006) states:United States Catholic Catechism for Adults, (Washington, D.C.: United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2006). In June 2008 the bishops decided by a vote of 231-14 to remove this from the next printing of the Catechism, because it could be construed to mean that Jews have their own path to salvation and do not need Christ or the Church.O'Brien: Bishops Vote to Revise U.S. Catechism on Jewish Covenant with God; CNS, In August 2009, the Vatican approved the change, and the revised text states (in conformity with the editio typica):U.S. Bishops get Vatican ‚ÄòRecognitio‚Äô for Change in Adult Catechism; USCCB News Release, =Protestant= In 2006, Evangelical Protestant Jerry Falwell denied a report in the Jerusalem Post that he supported dual-covenant theology:Jerusalem Post, 2006-03-02, Hagee, Falwell deny endorsing 'dual covenant' .

Margaret Stewart (; 25 December 1424 ‚Äì 16 August 1445) was a princess of Scotland and the dauphine of France. She was the firstborn child of King James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort. She married the eldest son of the king of France, Louis, Dauphin of France, at eleven years old. Their marriage was unhappy, and she died childless at age 20, apparently of a fever. Early life She was born in Perth, Scotland to James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort, a cousin of Henry V of England. Margaret was the first of six daughters and twin sons born to her parents (her surviving brother, James, would become James II of Scotland at six years old). Marriage Margaret was Charles VII of France's diplomatic choice for daughter-in-law.Paul Murray Kendall, Louis XI:The Universal Spider, (New York: W. W. Norton & Company Inc., 1971), 43. The marriage was forced upon Charles's twelve-year-old son, Louis, which did not help their relationship. However, royal marriages in the 15th century were always political.Tyrell, Joseph M. Louis XI. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1980. There are no direct accounts from Louis or Margaret of their first impressions of each other, and it is mere speculation to say whether or not they actually had negative feelings for each other. Several historians think that Louis had a predetermined attitude to hate his wife because she was his father's choice of bride. But it is universally agreed that Louis entered the ceremony and the marriage itself dutifully, as evidenced by his formal embrace of Margaret upon their first meeting on 24 June 1436, the day before their wedding. Margaret and Louis' marriage shows both the nature of medieval royal diplomacy and the precarious position of the French monarchy. The marriage took place 25 June 1436 in the afternoon in the chapel of the castle of Tours and was presided by the Archbishop of Reims. By the standards of the time, it was a very plain wedding.Cleugh,James. Chant Royal The Life of King Louis XI of France (1423-1483). Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1970. Louis, nearly thirteen, looked clearly more mature than his bride, eleven. Margaret looked like a beautiful \\"doll\\", perhaps because she was treated as such by her in-laws. Charles wore \\"grey riding pants\\" and \\"did not even bother to remove his spurs\\". The Scottish guests were quickly hustled out after the wedding reception. This was seen as something of a scandal by the Scots. King Charles' attire and the speed with which the guests were hustled out was considered an insult to Scotland, which was an important ally in France's war with the English. However, this spoke to the impoverished nature of the French court at this time. They simply could not afford an extravagant ceremony or to host their Scottish guests for any longer than they did. Following the ceremony, \\"doctors advised against consummation\\" because of the relative immaturity of the bride and bridegroom. Margaret continued her studies and Louis went on tour with Charles to loyal areas of the kingdom. Even at this time, Charles was taken aback by the intelligence and temper of his son. During this tour, Louis was named dauphin by Charles, as was traditional for the eldest son of the king. Margaret was considered lovely, gracious and very beautiful,(facie venusta valde, \\"a very lovely face,\\" according to the Book of Pluscarden) with a certain ability to write poetry and rhymes, though no example of her compositions survived destruction at her husband's hands after her death. She was also very interested in the French court's social and gallant life. She was a favourite of her father-in-law Charles VII of France and popular among the courtiers. However, she felt herself alien amongst the French court and became depressed. She had a strained relationship with her husband, the future king of France, mainly because of Louis' hatred of his father. Charles VII ordered the marriage, and Margaret frequently supported the king against her husband. It is said that she wore a strongly-tied corset because of her fear of pregnancies, ate green apples and drank apple vinegar. Her unhappy marriage furthered her depression, as did the gossip regarding her by supporters of Louis. Death Tomb of Margaret Stewart in the Saint-Laon church On 16 August 1445, between ten and eleven at night, she died in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, Marne, France at the age of 20. On Saturday, 7 August, she and her ladies had joined the court on a short pilgrimage. It was very hot, and when she returned, she undressed in her stone chamber. The next morning she was feverish, the doctor diagnosed the inflammation of the lungs. She died, raving against a Jamet de Tillay, a Breton soldier, in favour of her father-in-law, King Charles (Jamet surprised Margaret at her habitual poetry reading, when there were no candles, only a good fire in the mantelpiece; he stuck a candle into her face, sniggered and afterwards went around, talking about \\"wanton princesses\\". Louis was cold to Margaret, and she attributed his coldness to the gossip spread by Jamet. She died, protesting her faithfulness to her husband, and accused Jamet of killing her with his words). 1 Melancholic and distressed by slander against her, she sank into a final languor before dying. Her last words, in response to others' urgings to rouse herself and live, were supposedly Fi de la vie! qu'on ne m'en parle plus (\\"Fie on life! Speak no more of it to me\\"). She was buried in the Saint-Laon church (French) in Thouars, in the Deux-S√®vres department of France. Margaret is also famous for the legend that she was kissed or almost kissed by poet Alain Chartier while asleep in her own rooms (another variant of this legend has Anne of Brittany as its protagonist), though her age and location at the time of Chartier's death would have made that impossible.

The area is semi-mountainous with many small, but deep and narrow valleys. History In prehistoric times Pilo√±a lay along the natural path between Oviedo and Cangas de On√≠s, in the narrow basin that parallels the coast. Pilo√±a was the largest settlement along that path which connected central Asturias with the Asturian east. Even earlier there were paleolithic settlements in caves in Pilo√±a such as Aviao (Espinaredo) Cave, Collar√©u Cave, and La Pe√±a Ferran (Ferran Rock) which were excavated by the Count de la Vega del Sella in the 1920s. There are several sites with paleolithic rock art and Neanderthal remains, including Sidr√≥n Cave in Borines.

Licensed to Birmingham, Alabama, United States, the station serves the Birmingham metro area. The station is licensed to the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where it maintains its studios. WBHM features programming from American Public Media, National Public Radio and Public Radio International. On a sub-carrier channel, WBHM operates the Alabama Radio Reading Service, which broadcasts readings from the Birmingham News and popular magazines for blind and visually impaired residents of the Birmingham area. History Even though Huntsville beat Birmingham, the state's largest city (in population), in getting Alabama's first public radio station in October 1976 (the present WLRH), WBHM did not follow far behind, beginning operations on December 5. WBHM became Birmingham's first full-time classical station since the demise of a commercial FM outlet, WSFM, which gave way to the present WDJC-FM in 1967. WBHM no longer has local hosts for classical music; for most of the 2000s, it exclusively relied on the Classical Public Radio Network (a joint production of KUSC-FM in Los Angeles and Colorado Public Radio) to provide programming in the middle of the day, evenings, and overnight. When CPRN shut down operations in 2008, WBHM switched to an all-news/discussion format in the daytime hours with programming from PRI and NPR, a move that several other previously classical-formatted NPR affiliates elsewhere have made in recent times in response to listener demand. Classical music is now heard on WBHM only overnights after 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays (Midnight on Saturdays and Sundays). Monday through Saturday evenings are now devoted to jazz. On Sunday nights, two long-running atmospheric music programs, Echoes and Hearts of Space, air on WBHM. = WSGN = WSGN began operation as WEXP (for experiment) on February 11, 1975, primarily as a training facility for Gadsden State Community College's broadcasting department. The station was assembled using equipment donated from several Alabama radio stations and from Rick Maze of Birmingham, plus purchases from the State of Alabama Surplus Property warehouse. Construction was performed by broadcast instructors Don Smith and Bob Mayben with assistance from WBRC-TV personnel in Birmingham. The station was operated by students and faculty for many years. When both Smith and Mayben left the school for other interests, new instructor Neil Mullen took over the station operation and a cooperative arrangement was struck with WBHM to provide programming. The call letters of WSGN (for founder Birmingham News, the \\"South's Greatest Newspaper\\") date back to the beginning of radio broadcasting in the state, and were formerly located in Birmingham at 610 on the AM dial. In fact, there was a WSGN-FM in the 1950s which today is known as WDJC in Birmingham. The call letters were changed under Mullens' leadership when WSGN 610 AM was sold to a company that did not want to use the call letters, but did not want another station in Birmingham to be able to use them, so another deal was struck to rename WEXP as WSGN. As of 2013, the WEXP call letters are located in Brandon, Vermont.. Retrieved on 2008-04-17. On September 30, 2018, WSGN ceased broadcasting programming from WBHM as Gadsden State Community College sold the license to a non-profit faith-based broadcaster. The sale, to Educational Media Foundation, was consummated on January 31, 2019. Local programs Tapestry--Originally a weekly 30-minute program, the show spotlights aspects of Birmingham's local artistic and musical scene, as well as features interviews with artists coming through the Birmingham region, hosted by Greg Bass. From July 2009 to 2013, the program was reduced in frequency to a 60-minute monthly broadcast. Arts related segments on WBHM are now a part of regular news and feature shows, but Tapestry is no longer broadcast over the air. Tapestry archival programs and segments are still available on the WBHM website. In recent years, the WBHM news department has expanded, allowing for news content to be frequently inserted in Morning Edition (weekdays from 5-9am) and All Things Considered (weekdays from 3-7pm).

Coucheron played an important role in the history of Norwegian and Danish fortifications. As Sweden grew to be a great power in the 17th century, there were frequent wars in the Baltic region, and conflict was common along the borders between Sweden & Denmark-Norway. Easy invasions routes from Sweden were fortified on the Danish-Norwegian border with new or upgraded fortresses during this period, effectively establishing the modern borders between Norway & Sweden. Anthony Coucheron played a major role in fortification of the border, both in Norway and Denmark in addition, he participated with honor in combat during the Gyldenl√∏ve War. Career =Early career= Coucheron was born about 1650 (probably in Holland). Coucheron was a construction supervisor at Fredriksten fortress Coucheron worked as construction supervisor in Fredrikstad in 1665 and was assistant to his father 1666. His father was the Dutch-born Danish- Norwegian Quartermaster General Willem Coucheron, who began the construction of the fortifications at Fredrikstad in 1663. Together they worked on the fortification which became known as Fredriksten fortress in Halden. In 1673 Anthony Coucheron was sent as lieutenant (in Norwegian l√∏ytnant) to Kongsvinger Fortress in Elverum to prepare plans for expansion of the existing fortification. Coucheron was then promoted to lieutenant commander (in Norwegian kapteinl√∏ytnant) at Akershus in 1674, and in the same year he was promoted to captain. =Gyldenl√∏ve War= During the Gyldenl√∏ve War (1675‚Äì1679) he served from 1675‚Äì76 as captain of the governor general's dragoons. He was then assigned to Denmark, where he served as quartermaster general in charge of military engineering from 1 May 1676. He served in his father's regiment as captain, from 1677 until the regiment was disbanded in 1679, participating in fighting in Bohusl√§n, participating in the capture of Karlsten Fortress in Marstrand in July 1677 and was a member of the Danish- Norwegian force led by Norway's Governor General Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenl√∏ve in the Danish-Norwegian victory over Sweden at the Battle of Uddevalla in 1679. =Service after the Gyldenl√∏ve War= After the war he was promoted rapidly (following in the footsteps of his father) and became quartermaster general in Norway from 1680‚Äì1684. He was also named commandant and colonel at the Danish Christians√∏ fortressNot to be mistaken for the Norwegian Christians√∏ Fortress. located on Ertholmene in 1681. Kronborg Fortress is an UNESCO World Heritage Site The city of Trondheim was destroyed by a fire in April 1681. Danish- Norwegian King Christian V directed Major General Johan Caspar von Cicignon and Quartermaster General Coucheron to develop plans for reconstruction of the city, which were to include a new fortifications. The resulting design included exterior fortifications, streets optimized to relocate military forces in defense, and a stronghold‚ÄîKristiansten Fortress. Construction of Kristiansten Fortress was completed in 1684. In addition to working on the city reconstruction and fortifications at Trondheim, Kongsvinger and Elverum, he also worked on the remodeling of Akershus Fortress and plans for fortifying Fredrikstad. Coucheron began work on the fortification of Danish Christians√∏ fortress located on Ertholmene an island east of Bornholm, (begun in 1684) and Fladstrand in Fredrikshavn in 1687). Together with the commandant Jacob Geveke he undertook the fortification of Kronborg (1686‚Äì1688); after their work was completed Kronborg was considered the strongest fortress of the period in Europe. In 1687 he was installed as commandant at Akershus Fortress, where he died on 14 March 1689. Family He was the son of Willem Coucheron and Maria Fessers. He married a Dutch-born woman, Magdalena Alendolphia van Langen, who survived him. References Other sources * *V.E. Tychsen: Fortifikations-Etaterne og Ingeni√∏rkorpset, 1884 *Chr.

It stretches approximately from Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) near Manly Corner west of Edmonton to the British Columbia border west of Demmitt. It is designated as a core route in Canada's National Highway System, comprising a portion of a key international corridor that stretches from Alaska into Mexico. Highway 43 was originally numbered Highway 17, a short gravel road that ran only from Highway 16 to Onoway. It was later extended to Whitecourt and renumbered as Highway 43 in the 1940s, and an extension to Valleyview had been completed by the mid-1950s. In 1991 the highway was extended to included a portion of the existing Highway 34 from Valleyview to Donnelly, but was revised in 1998 to turn west through Grande Prairie, forming a contiguous route from Manly Corner to the border. Due to increasing traffic levels and the province's greater plan to upgrade their portion of the CANAMEX Corridor, work began in the 2000s to twin the entire length of the highway. The Edmonton‚ÄìGrande Prairie section was completed in summer 2014, and construction began in 2016 on an expressway bypass to the northwest of Grande Prairie. Planning is underway for the remaining section between the BC border and Beaverlodge.  Route description Highway 43 begins west of Demmitt at the British Columbia border and runs through Grande Prairie, Valleyview, and Whitecourt to Highway 16 near Manly Corner west of Edmonton.  History  = Construction and paving = The history of Highway 43 dates back to the late 1920s or early 1930s. It was originally numbered Highway 17 and, by 1932, it spanned approximately 17 km from Highway 16 to Onoway. By 1938, Highway 17 (now 43) had been extended to Sangudo and it had reached Whitecourt via a jagged alignment with numerous 90¬∞ jogs by 1940. Sometime between 1942 and 1946, the highway was renumbered to Highway 43. The former number was transferred to Highway 17 that straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan provincial boundary north and south of Lloydminster. By 1952, extension of Highway 43 from Whitecourt to Valleyview was well underway. The segment of the highway from Valleyview to Little Smoky was complete, while the segment from Whitecourt to Two Creeks was under construction. The next segment of the highway, from Little Smoky to west of Giroux Lake, opened a year later. In 1954, the connecting segment of Highway 43 between west of Giroux Lake and Two Creeks was under construction. Meanwhile, paving of the highway between Highway 16 and Gunn was complete. Westbound lanes of Highway 43, west of Whitecourt The final segment of Highway 43 between Whitecourt and Valleyview was officially completed in 1955 and a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in the Iosegun River valley, approximately 20 km southeast of Fox Creek. The completion of the highway provided the south Peace Region of northwest Alberta, particularly Grande Prairie and Valleyview, with a more direct and significantly shorter route to Edmonton. It also slightly shortened the driving distance from Peace River to Edmonton once the Highway 34 realignment north of Valleyview was completed by 1959. An aggressive paving program began shortly after the highway was completed. Paving began northwest of Whitecourt and south of Valleyview. By 1960, the entire length of the highway was paved, which included a significant realignment between Whitecourt and Cottonwood Corner south of Blue Ridge and other minor realignments between Cottonwood Corner and Gunn to smooth out the highway's numerous jogs. = Extension by renumbering = In 1990/1991, Highway 43 was extended by the Province through a highway renumbering. In particular, the stretch of highway between Valleyview and Donnelly (Highways 34 and 2) was renumbered to Highway 43. However, this extension proved to last only until 1998 when the Province completed a second set of highway renumberings in northwest Alberta. On March 1, 1998, the portion of Highway 43 north of Valleyview was renumbered to Highway 49 to allow for the renumbering of Highway 34 (from Valleyview to north of Grande Prairie) and Highway 2 (from north of Grande Prairie to the British Columbia border via Grande Prairie, Beaverlodge and Hythe) was renumbered as Highway 43. The renumbering had two advantages: it established Highway 43 as a continuous highway number from Highway 16 through the Peace Country to the British Columbia border, simplifying travel, and it created fewer highway number changes along the CANAMEX Corridor, the Alberta portion of which stretches from Coutts at the United States border to the BC border west of Grande Prairie. = Twinning = Highway 43 eastbound, west of Whitecourt The initial twinning of Highway 43 began in the early 1970s with the first segment, from Highway 16 to north of Highway 633 (then numbered Highway 33), open by 1974. Eight years later, the second segment was twinned from north of Highway 633 to west of Gunn. Twinning of Highway 43 then ceased for 15 years until a segment within Whitecourt from Govenlock Road/Mill Road, just east of the McLeod River, to east of 33 Street in Whitecourt's southeast end was opened by 1997. Shortly after this segment was twinned, the Province announced an aggressive twinning program for the highway from Gunn to the BC border as part of Alberta's North-South Trade (CANAMEX) Corridor initiative. By 1999, the twinning program saw its first two segments open ‚Äì from Grande Prairie westward towards British Columbia (halfway to Wembley) and from Whitecourt eastward towards Edmonton (halfway to Highway 658). Two years later, the twinned portions of Highway 43 west of Grande Prairie and east of Whitecourt had been extended to Highway 724 serving Wembley and Highway 658 serving Blue Ridge respectively. Also in 2001, twinning in three other locations was complete ‚Äì from east of Highway 2 to west of Highway 733 (east of Grande Prairie), from the eastern boundary of the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation through Valleyview to south of Highway 665, and from northwest of Fox Creek to southeast of Fox Creek near the Highway 947 intersection. In 2002, the two largest newly twinned segments of Highway 43 had opened to traffic. The largest segment stretched from Whitecourt to west of Two Creeks. The other segment stretched from west of Highway 733 to Crooked Creek, which included a realignment to bypass Bezanson. The interchange with Highway 2 north of Grande Prairie also opened to traffic on October 3, 2002. By 2003, the first newly twinned segment in over 20 years at Highway 43's southeastern end was open to traffic ‚Äì starting from west of Gunn and ending east of Highway 765 near Glenevis. Also, the brief 2 km segment from Highway 2 (north of Grande Prairie) to east of Highway 2 opened upon completion of an interchange at Highway 2 and a grade separation over a CN rail line. By 2004, three additional segments of Highway 43 had been twinned. The first was from northwest of Fox Creek to near Giroux Lake. The second was filling in the gap between Fox Creek and Whitecourt from west of Highway 947 to west of Two Creeks. The third was from east of Highway 658 to east of Green Court/Highway 18. the same name. In 2005, three segments of twinned Highway 43 opened to traffic including from west of Fox Creek to west of Iosegun Lake, from west of Sangudo to west of Cherhill, and from west of Cherhill to west of Gunn. The twinning of two additional segments of Highway 43 was completed in 2007, including from Asplund Creek (south of Highway 665) to west of Iosegun Lake (south of Little Smoky), and from east of Green Court to west of Sangudo. With these segments completed, over of Highway 43 was continuously twinned from Highway 16 to west of Valleyview. Also in 2007, the Government of Alberta announced that twinning of Highway 43 would go through the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation after previously deciding in 2006 to bypass it by routing the highway to the north side of Sturgeon Lake. Subsequently, construction of the remaining between Crooked Creek and Valleyview, including through the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, began in the fall of 2010 and was completed on Sept. 12, 2014. In 2010, from Highway 723 east of Beaverlodge to Highway 724 at Wembley was twinned. = Grande Prairie bypass = In September 2019, the western leg of the Grande Prairie bypass as completed and opened to traffic in September 2019. In December 2018, then-premier Rachel Notley announced a new, full interchange at Highway 43X (Grande Prairie bypass) and Highway 43 (100 Avenue); however, the interchange is still several years into the future. As part of the project, Highway 43 was moved to the Grande Prairie Bypass (previously designated as Highway 43X) while the former section through Grande Prairie along 100 Avenue, 108 Street/116 Avenue, and 100 Street became jurisdiction of the City of Grande Prairie.  Highway 43X  Highway 43X is the temporary designation of future realignments of Highway 43 in northwest Alberta ‚Äì one was a partially constructed northwest bypass around Grande Prairie, and the other will act as a south bypass around Whitecourt once constructed in the future. = Grande Prairie = The first segment of the Grande Prairie bypass, initially signed as Highway 43X, opened to traffic on July 30, 2010 to a twinned standard. It was in length, extending westward from the Highway 43/2 interchange, north of Grande Prairie city limits, to 116 Street/Range Road 63, serving Grande Prairie to the south and the County of Grande Prairie No. 1 to the north. The next segment of the bypass, in length, was announced in April 2016 and was completed and opened to traffic in September 2019. As part of the project, Highway 43X became part of Highway 43. = Whitecourt = A study for the future alignment of a south bypass around Whitecourt was completed in the 1980s, with a future alignment being registered in 1984. The registered alignment begins in west Whitecourt, just north of a Canadian National (CN) rail line, and ends southeast of Whitecourt, just west of Highway 43's current at-grade intersection with East Mountain Road (Range Road 115B)/Deer Foot Road (Township Road 592B). The bypass will cross over the CN rail line, Highway 32, the McLeod River, Govenlock Road/West Mountain Road (Range Road 122) and Beaver Creek. Three interchange opportunities have been identified ‚Äì one in the vicinity of the current Highway 43/32 interchange in west Whitecourt, one at Govenlock Road/West Mountain Road, and one at the east end of the bypass southeast of Whitecourt. The design of the future interchange in west Whitecourt is anticipated to be complicated by the convergence of two existing highways, the adjacency of the CN rail line, the short distance between Highway 32 and the McLeod River to the south, existing highway commercial and industrial development along Highway 43 and Highway 32 respectively, and the close proximity of another interchange opportunity to the southeast at Govenlock Road/West Mountain Road, just east of the McLeod River. The right-of-way is designated as Highway 43X. A functional planning study was initiated in 2008 for the Highway 43/43X interchange southeast of Whitecourt. The study considers three options, all of which incorporate a direct connection to East Mountain Road. Construction of the interchange is not anticipated to occur for 5‚Äì10 years. A functional plan for the remainder of the bypass has not yet been undertaken, and is anticipated to be planned under a separate project.

Theophylact or Theophylaktos (d. 845 AD) became bishop of Nicomedia in Asia Minor following the Iconoclastic Controversy of the eighth century. He was well known for having built churches, hospices, and homes for wanderers. He generously distributed alms, was the guardian of orphans, widows and the sick, and personally attended those afflicted with leprosy, not hesitating to wash their wounds. During the iconoclast reign of Leo the Armenian (813-820 AD), Theophylaktos argued vigorously for the use of art in the Church. The emperor sent him into exile for his disagreement. He is recognized as a Saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church for his tireless defense of the faith, for miraculous deeds attributed to him, and for his Christian spirit. His life is commemorated on March 8.

During his professional boxing career he was known for his hand and foot speed, and the ability to switch effortlessly from the orthodox stance to the southpaw stance. Many opponents were confused by this style, and some boxing experts contend that Crawley might have been the best \\"switch hitter\\" of his time along with middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler. As an amateur, Tyrone compiled a record of 56-6 (22 RSCs), and was a Golden Gloves champion and All Army champion in the late 1970s. Tyrone turned pro in October 1980 and won the ESPN lightweight title in only his ninth pro fight with a twelve-round decision over knockout puncher Al \\"Earthquake\\" Carter in September 1982. In his next fight, Crawley scored an impressive ten- round decision over future jr. welterweight champion Gene Hatcher on national television in October 1982. He defended his ESPN lightweight in December 1982 with a tenth round stoppage of Anthony Murray, but lost his ESPN title in a close 12-round decision to Melvin Paul in his next fight in February 1983. Crawley entered the Paul fight with a broken knuckle and broken finger. Crawley rebounded in 1983 and scored a huge upset win over #1 lightweight contender Robin Blake in Blake's hometown of Levelland, Texas. Blake had knocked out Melvin Paul in his previous fight, and many expected him to dispose of Crawley easily. Blake was zeroing in on a title shot with Ray \\"Boom Boom\\" Mancini, but Blake had trouble solving Crawley's style, and was soundly beaten in a lopsided ten-round decision. In 1984, Livingstone Bramble dethroned Ray Mancini to take the WBA lightweight title. Crawley was the #1 contender, and accepted $150,000 to step aside and allow Bramble and Mancini to engage in a rematch. Bramble defeated Mancini in their rematch on February 16, 1985. Crawley won the USBA lightweight title in June 1985 with a twelve- round decision over crosstown rival and future IBF lightweight champion Charlie \\"Choo Choo\\" Brown. Crawley was supposed to challenge Bramble for the WBA lightweight crown on a few occasions in 1985, but the bout was postponed due to injuries to both fighters. Bramble and Crawley finally met for Bramble's title in February 1986 in Reno, Nevada. Crawley suffered the first knockdown of his career in the second round of that bout, but rallied over the next several rounds to draw even on the scorecards after eight rounds. Crawley eventually tired late in the fight, and was knocked out in the 13th round. After the Bramble bout, Crawley joined the Philadelphia Police Department during the summer of 1986. He resumed his boxing career in June 1987 while maintaining his duties with the Philadelphia P.D. He scored three more wins, and retired from professional boxing in early 1988 with a record of 22-2 (7 KOs). In that same year, Tyrone was named Director of the North Philadelphia Police Athletic League, a position he still holds to this day. Crawley attended Temple University. He was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003. He was also recently inducted as a member of the 2010 class of the Pennsylvania Boxing Hall of Fame. Tyrone has 3 children, Ageenah his eldest child, Tyrone Crawley Jr a current professional boxer, and Kevin Crawley an entertainment screenwriter.

In addition, it provides the registries of the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts with an electronic registry and workflow system; and an electronic case file. Recent enhancements have added a module which facilitates the conduct of hearing using documents that have been electronically filed. The EFS provides the legal profession with a rudimentary online case file from which documents can be electronically filed with the courts or served on the other parties in a case. The EFS is also the source for electronic cause book searches that are provided through the Litigation module of LawNet. EFS is set to be replaced by iELS eventually. An Overview of the Electronic Filing System The Electronic Filing System (EFS) was implemented by the Singapore Judiciary to provide a platform for Law Firms (LFs) to file documents to the Courts electronically over the Internet. The EFS was specifically designed to fully exploit the electronic super highway to minimise not just the physical movement of people and paper court documents from LFs to the Courts, but also to leverage the benefits of electronic storage within the Courts: i.e. faster document filing and retrieval, eradication of the misplacement of case files, concurrent access to view the same case filed by different parties, etc. Within the Courts, the EFS allows electronic documents to be automatically routed to the appropriate registry staff for processing. The system allows further routing within the courts e.g. for approvals by the Duty Registrar and a reply is then sent out by the Registry staff which is routed back to the originating LF. This has enabled realisations of improvements in efficiency by minimising paper flow to shorten case processing time. Fees payable by the LFs for filing documents to Court are deducted automatically by the EFS. The whole process is fast, convenient and efficient. For the LFs, the EFS provides an electronic case file showing hearing dates and documents file by them, served on them or received from the Courts. It also provides an electronic platform for the service of documents on other LFs. The EFS also allows for faster response as well as accurate and up-to-date information. Hence, other benefits of the EFS include the speedy inspection of documents electronically and the ability to request for and receive electronic extracts of documents via the Internet. Electronic cause book searches and legal research are also available through LawNet. Lawyers can even obtain details of hearing fixtures via Short Messaging System (SMS) using their mobile phones. Within the court room, registrars make use of the EFS to conduct hearings in chambers electronically using the EFS. =The components of EFS= The EFS consists of the following components: * The Front-End (FE) accessed via the Internet from each ‚ÄòEFS ready‚Äô Law Firm‚Äôs desktop. * A Gateway (GW) that receives submissions from the LFs or the replies from the Courts, routes it to the appropriate party and computes the fees payable by the LF for the transaction. * The Courts‚Äô Workflow (WF) application that resides on Courts‚Äô computers and caters for the internal routing and workflow processes within the courts. * A Hearing Module that is used to conduct hearings electronically. * A stand-alone Key Management System (KMS) =Front End Application= The EFS FE is a web based solution that LFs access from their PCs via the Internet. A LF needs to register in order to gain access. Upon registration, the LF would be issued with smart cards containing the digital certificates from the Court‚Äôs Certification Authority. The FE provides LFs with an online case file through which they can view the documents which have been filed by them, served on them or replied from the Courts. Upcoming hearing dates are also pushed through the EF at the law firm level and at the case level. The FE‚Äôs File-n- Serve feature facilitates service of documents on other parties in the case with one click of the mouse. Documents are transmitted in Portable Document Format (PDF). To file or serve a document, the LF has to fill up the appropriate online template in the FE and attach the document to be filed or served in PDF format. The entire submission may consist of one or several documents and this is digitally signed using the smart card issued upon registration in order to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation. =The Gateway= When the LF files a document to the Court, the submission is actually received by the GW which then performs certain validations, computes the fees to be charged and identifies to which user department the submission is to be routed to. Replies from the Court are received by the GW and routed to the correct LF for retrieval. The GW performs the following crucial functions: (a) Automated validation checks when documents are filed; (b) Implementation of certain special rules; (c) Automated routing of submissions into Courts‚Äô in-trays; (d) Computation of stamp and other filing fees; (e) Exchange of information between the Back End and the Front End. =Court‚Äôs Workflow Application= The business logic of the courts is built into this application. It encapsulates workflow routing, document management and statistical report generation; documents are stored in a jukebox. An electronic case file allows the easy retrieval of documents; and an upcoming enhancement will collate and present information relating to a case file within a single easy to use interface. =Hearing Module= The Hearing Module is customised to allow registrars and judges to make use of the EFS to conduct paper-less hearings in chambers. The Hearing Module pre-fetches the entire case file of hearings fixed before a registrar to the local PC to allow quick recall of documents. Dual screens are deployed to allow the viewing of the case file and minute sheets on one screen and the viewing of documents on the other. The Pack-n-Go feature allows registrars and judges to download all the documents in a case file onto a thumb drive for reading at home. =Key Management System= The Courts operates as an independent Certification Authority which issues digital certificates on smart cards to LFs. The Key Management System (KMS), which is central to this function, comprises the following components: (a) A Certificate Authority Management System used to issue and revoke digital certificates; (b) A Certificate Server that centrally stores the digital certificates; (d) A web-based Certificate Client System which LFs use to manage smart cards issued to them and to request for and receive digital certificates which are then stored in the smart cards; and (e) A web-based Key Generating Software which LF use to generate their private‚Äìpublic key pair. Implementation Historyy =Initial planning (1990 to 1997)= The early 1990s saw a number of technological initiatives that would eventually pave the way for the development of the EFS. The LawNet information service, which originally provided a single database of statutes for the legal profession, was launched in 1990. The operation of LawNet and other related technological developments was under the purview of the LawNet Council (the predecessor of the present LawNet Management Committee). From a basic legal research service, LawNet was eventually expanded between 1992 and 1997 into a comprehensive network of computer services for the legal sector, comprising six modules covering major areas of legal practice: *Litigation *Conveyancing *Corporate Law *Intellectual Property *Legal Research *Integrated Law Office. A Judicial Administration computerisation programme was completed in 1994. Under this programme, a comprehensive network infrastructure was put in place to support various applications, including connectivity to external systems. An Electronic Bulletin Board was also set up to facilitate communication through electronic means as a step towards the paperless office environment. In 1995, the first Technology Court was launched. The Technology Court featured digital recording and transcription of proceedings, as well as facilities for the multimedia presentation of evidence. A Remote Chamber Hearing System was also launched to enable members of the legal profession to have ex parte matters heard via desktop video conferencing, and a Judicial Officer‚Äôs Bulletin Board was set up as part of the incremental shift towards a paperless court system. As the cornerstone of a new electronic paperless case management system, the Electronic Filing System (EFS) initiative was first proposed to the LawNet Council in 1995. Under the proposed EFS, law firms would be able to file their suits and submit documents through an electronic data interchange. In addition to electronic filing, the proposed EFS was to incorporate an electronic case document extract service, allow for electronic service of documents, and provide for a comprehensive electronic information service. =Phases of Implementation (1997 to 2004)= Phase 1.0 (8 March 1997) :Phase 1.0 of the EFS was launched on 8 March 1997 as a pilot programme with voluntary participation for lawyers. The scope of implementation was limited to only certain aspects of writs of summons. The purpose of this pilot phase was to enable planners to benefit from the lessons learnt in order to fine-tune subsequent phases of implementation. Phase 1.2 (1 March 2000) :Phase 1.2 of the EFS was launched on 1 March 2000. Mandatory e-filing to the courts was introduced, and the scope of EFS was expanded to cover most aspects of writs of summons and their corresponding workflow systems. A service bureau was also set up to cater to those law firms that were not yet EFS-equipped at this stage. Phase 2 (2 July 2001) :Phase 2 of the EFS was launched on 2 July 2001. This phase saw the introduction of a web-based front-end interface for EFS users, a full-text Electronic Index Search and Extract Service, and an Electronic Service of Documents Facility. The Electronic Index Search and Extract Service allowed law firms to search an electronic case file index and request the extraction of soft copies or certified true copies of case documents. Under the Electronic Service of Documents Facility, law firms were allowed to electronically serve documents on other EFS-ready law firms. Phase 3 (18 December 2001) :Phase 3 of the EFS was launched on 18 December 2001. The scope of EFS was expanded to include originating summons, appeals to the Court of Appeal, District Court appeals, taxation of costs, interpleader, and the admission of advocates & solicitors. Phase 4A (28 May 2002) :Phase 4A of the EFS was launched on 28 May 2002. The scope of EFS was expanded to include more forms of civil proceedings such as admiralty matters, originating motions, originating petitions, originating summons in bankruptcy, bankruptcy petitions, petitions of course, companies winding-up, power of attorney, and probate (Supreme Court). Phase 4B(i) (9 December 2002) :Phase 4B(i) of the EFS was launched on 9 December 2002. This phase saw the inclusion of applications for adoption petitions under the EFS, namely, the auto-generation of adoption petitions in the Family Court using information provided in the form of an electronic data items template. Phase 4B(ii) (15 December 2003) :Phase 4B(ii) of the EFS was launched on 15 December 2003. In the Family Court, the scope of EFS was expanded to include petitions for divorce under the Women's Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) and originating summonses under the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed), the Women's Charter, the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3, 1999 Rev Ed) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed). The scope of EFS was also expanded to cover probate and administration proceedings in the Subordinate Courts, and procedures were enhanced in respect of probate and administration proceedings in the Supreme Court. Phase 5 (22 December 2004) :Phase 5 of the EFS was implemented in several sub- phrases between July 2003 and December 2004, and was deemed commissioned on 22 December 2004. Under this phase, EFS was extended to the Corporate Services Department of the Supreme Court. Data contained within the existing mainframe- based civil system was migrated to the EFS. In addition, the ability to generate statistical reports was added to the EFS. Phase 6 (10 January 2005) :Phase 6 of the EFS was implemented on 10 January 2005. The scope of EFS was expanded to encompass criminal matters in the Supreme Court, including: preliminary inquiries, criminal cases, criminal appeals to the Court of Appeal, criminal revision proceedings, criminal reference proceedings, magistrates‚Äô appeals, criminal motions, and show cause proceedings. The EFS Review In April 2003, The Honourable the Chief Justice appointed an EFS Review Committee to conduct a thorough appraisal of the EFS. This review would ensure the system‚Äôs continuing relevance, in tandem with the development of technology and the evolving needs of the legal profession. The EFS Review Committee made certain recommendations for improvements to the EFS, which were accepted by The Honourable the Chief Justice. The EFS Review Implementation Committee (ERIC) was established in August 2003 to implement the recommendations made by the EFS Review Committee. ERIC was to oversee the development of a new Electronic Litigation System to take the place of the current EFS. This system would capitalise on the experience garnered from the current EFS as well as harness projected new and improved technology for the new electronic case management system. In this regard, ERIC was to develop a Roadmap Paper charting the direction of the new Electronic Litigation System, as well as co-ordinate with the Rules Committee to review and modernise the Rules of Court. The first project which ERIC undertook was the organisation of the Electronic Litigation Colloquium, held on 17 April 2004 at The Sentosa Spa & Resort (formerly known as The Beaufort). The aim of the colloquium was to provide a platform for the stakeholders in the EFS to get together and canvass their views and ideas as to what the new landscape for electronic litigation in Singapore should look like. Representatives from the bench, the bar, IT vendors and the InfoComm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) were invited to the Colloquium, in order to obtain a good representation from the various stakeholders of the litigation process. Subsequently, a Select Group was set up to draft the Roadmap Paper and come up with a blueprint to pave the way for the development of the new Electronic Litigation System. The Electronic Litigation Roadmap In the course of discussions, it was decided that the appropriate terminology for the new system was the ‚ÄúElectronic Litigation Systems‚Äù (ELS) since the interoperability of different systems would be necessary in order to cater for the myriad of new features in the ELS. The Roadmap Paper is broadly divided into two main sections. The first section describes the functionalities that the ELS will provide. The second part addresses certain corollary issues following from the first section. The structure of the Roadmap Paper is as follows: Part I: Functionalities of the ELS (a) Case management for law firms; (b) Case management for the courts; and (c) Electronic hearings. Part II: Corollary considerations (a) Reviewing the litigation process; (b) Costs and business models; and (c) Open technical standards for integration and interoperability. The Electronic Litigation Roadmap Public Consultation Following the first publication of the Electronic Litigation Roadmap on 10 January 2005, there was a period of Public Consultation whereby the courts, law firms, government departments and IT vendors were invited to give their feedback on the ideas mooted in the ELS Roadmap. To this end, the ELS Roadmap Paper was published on the websites of the Supreme Court, the Subordinate Courts, the Singapore Academy of Law and LawNet. There were a heartening number of responses, with a balanced distribution of comments from the stakeholders involved. The responses were generally supportive of the ideas that were proposed in the ELS Roadmap Paper, providing pertinent ‚Äì and at times, very detailed ‚Äì observations and comments on the various concepts contained therein. At the close of the Public Consultation, the Electronic Litigation Roadmap was revised accordingly to incorporate the relevant responses received. ERIC was also reconstituted to form the ELS Committee in May 2005. It is envisaged that in the course of implementing the ELS, focus group discussions will be conducted to seek feedback on specific aspects of the ELS. At the same time, reviews of the ELS will be sought from the various stakeholders at appropriate intervals during the process of implementation.

In 1994, he was named Rookie of the Year in the United States Wrestling Association promotion out of Memphis. He also had a reign as NAASW North American Heavyweight champion in Jonesboro, Arkansas, beating Cactus Jack, and as USWA Unified World Heavyweight champion, beating Jerry Lawler. Until winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in September 2000, he had been the NWA North American Heavyweight champion, the top belt recognized by the NWA Worldwide promotion based out of Nashville. Colorado Kid teamed with Scuffling Hillbilly and the duo won and held the North American Tag Team title for about 18 months from early 1996 to late 1997. He was the first American wrestler ever to win a match in China. His son, Mike Rapada Jr., is currently a wrestler on the independent circuit. In 2001, Mike Rapada moved to San Diego, CA, where he began training local talent and in 2004, Rapada started Southwestern Alliance of Wrestling (\\"SAW\\"). SAW had the privilege of wrestling at local elementary schools throughout the San Diego area helping to raise money for military and underprivileged children. SAW also performed at many of the street fairs every year in the local communities and yearly at the Christmas Party that The Nice Guys of San Diego sponsored for the children of San Diego and military families. The event attracted 20,000 people and was held at Qualcomm Stadium. Mike Rapada's vision was to create family friendly professional wrestling shows. In early 2010, Rapada returned to Nashville where he works and continues to wrestle locally for independent wrestling companies.

He also lived in an openly gay relationship with the writer Th√©odore Leclercq (1777-1851), with whom he was buried after his death. Career Fi√©v√©e was born and died in Paris. The son of a restaurant owner, he became a publisher during the French Revolution, most notably editing La Chronique de Paris, a newspaper; it was here that he started his career as journalist, but unfortunately incurred the suspicion of authorities who had him imprisoned during the Reign of Terror. He was a member of the royalist network around the Abbey de Montesquiou, and was forced to go into hiding during the Directoire. While in hiding, he wrote his novel on changing times and mores, La Dot de Suzette, which was a great literary success. From 1800 to 1803, he wrote a column for the Gazette de France. He was again imprisoned in the Temple (Paris) by order of Joseph Fouch√©, but he was freed at the request of Bonaparte. He became a kind of secret agent for Napoleon, informing him of political affairs in France and England. From 1804 to 1807, he was editor in chief of the Journal des d√©bats, which became Journal de l'Empire. He was ennobled by the Emperor; was named \\"ma√Ætre des requ√™tes\\" to the Conseil d'√âtat in 1810; then \\"Pr√©fet\\" of the Ni√®vre d√©partment from 1813 to 1815. A supporter of Louis XVIII of France during the initial Restoration, he was banished during the Hundred Days. Having become one of the intellectuals of the \\"ultra\\" party and writer for the papers La Quotidienne and the Conservateur, he eventually became more politically liberal after 1818. A strong supporter of the freedom of the press, he was sentenced to three months of prison in the Conciergerie where Casimir Perier visited him. He became a contributor to the journals Temps in 1829 and National in 1831. Private life Joseph Fi√©v√©e married in 1790 (his brother-in-law was Charles Fr√©d√©ric Perlet), but his wife died giving birth, leaving him one child. At the end of the 1790s, he met the writer Th√©odore Leclercq who became his life companion, and the two would live and raise Fi√©v√©e's son together. When becoming Pr√©fet, Fi√©v√©e and Leclercq moved to the Ni√®vre department, and their open relationship greatly shocked some locals. The two men were received together in the salons of the Restoration. Both men are buried in the same tomb at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

Knapik (born 1970) is an American former professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure with World Championship Wrestling under the ring name Robbie Rage and as a part of the tag team High Voltage with Kenny Kaos. Early life Knapik grew up in Plymouth, Massachusetts and played a variety of sports while growing up, including baseball, hockey and soccer. Throughout his childhood, he suffered abuse from his father. Knapik began working out to relieve stress, and eventually began taking steroids at age 18. After graduating high school, he attended college, but left after it did not work out. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling (1996‚Äì2000)= Knapik attended a wrestling show in Florida in 1995 at the suggestion of a friend, and after calling various promoters and wrestling promotions, he was signed to a contract with World Championship Wrestling later on in the year. Along with Kenny Stasiowski, Knapik began training in WCW's Power Plant wrestling school. Upon completion of their training, Knapik and Stasiowski debuted on WCW television under the ring names Robbie Rage and Kenny Kaos, respectively, and they formed the tag team High Voltage. High Voltage regularly appeared against mid-card opponents on the WCW television shows Saturday Night and WorldWide during the late 1990s, while also appearing as jobbers on Nitro. In 1997, Rage and Kaos travelled to Japan to perform for New Japan Pro Wrestling. Upon arriving, they began feuding with nWo Japan, the Japanese version of the New World Order (nWo) before representing WCW in the Super Grade Tag League. Upon their return to the United States, Knapik joined Tim Catalfo's Obake Gym and befriended Yuji Nagata, who was also wrestling in WCW. After suffering a rotator cuff tear, Knapik was sidelined from wrestling for seven months. During this time, High Voltage disbanded as Kaos began competing as a singles wrestler before being nominated by Rick Steiner to become his new tag team partner, resulting in Kaos becoming one half of the World Tag Team Champions. On the December 17, 1998 episode of Thunder, Rage, while sporting a brace to nurse his arm injury, returned to confront Kaos over the matter of allying with Steiner rather than himself to claim the title. On the December 21 episode of Nitro, Rage distracted Kaos in order to allow Lex Luger to defeat him via submission before once again confronting Kaos over High Voltage's split. However, before the angle could develop any further, Knapik was released from his contract during his recovery. =Return to NJPW and retirement (2000‚Äì2002, 2005‚Äì2007)= After leaving WCW, Knapik, under the ring name Rob Rage, returned to NJPW in 2000 and found success in the mid-card as singles wrestler until leaving the promotion on July 20, 2002. Knapnik went on a hiatus soon afterwards before returning to wrestling by joining the World Wrestling Council on August 28, 2005. He remained with the WWC until September 14, 2007, when he wrestled his final match during the promotion's Septiembre Negro Tour. After retiring from wrestling, Knapik began working as a personal trainer. Personal life During his recovery for a rotator cuff tear, Knapik became depressed before being released from WCW during his recovery. Soon afterwards he began using, and ultimately became addicted to, painkillers and ecstasy in order to combat his depression. Knapik also lost his home, several cars and a house in Florida due to being unable to pay for them all. After becoming sober, Knapik became a born again Christian. Knapik has two tattoos. One is a tribal design on his right forearm, while the other is a signature design surrounding kanji on his left forearm.

She was considered a saint in her own time, and for centuries following her death, as noted by her appearance in the Fasti Mariani Calendar of Saints of 1630, and Butler's Lives of the Saints - Concise Edition, published in the 18th century. Her notability began when she was 21 years old. About to be buried and already in the church resting in an open coffin, according to the custom of the time, during the Agnus Dei of her funeral Mass she arose, stupefying with amazement the whole city of St. Trond, which had witnessed this wonder. She died at the age of seventy-four. Christina receives attention today for the strange descriptions of her miracles as much as for her faith. Her memorial day is 24 July.  Life  Christina was born to a religious family, the youngest of three daughters. After being orphaned at the age of fifteen, she worked taking the herds to pasture. She suffered a massive seizure when she was in her early 20s. Her condition was so severe that witnesses assumed she had died. A funeral was held, but during the service, \\"she arose full of vigour, stupefying with amazement the whole city of Sint- Truiden, which had witnessed this wonder. She levitated up to the rafters, later explaining that she could not bear the smell of the sinful people there.\\"Saint Christina the Astonishing at the Patron Saint Index She related that she had witnessed Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. She said that as soon as her soul was separated from her body, angels conducted it to a very gloomy place, entirely filled with souls whose torments endured there were such that it was impossible for them to describe. She claimed that she had been offered a choice either to remain in heaven or return to earth to perform penance to deliver souls from the flames of Purgatory. Christina agreed to return to life and arose that same moment. She told those around her that for the sole purpose of relief of the departed and conversion of sinners did she return. Christina renounced all comforts of life, reduced herself to extreme destitution, dressed in rags, lived without home or hearth, and not content with privations she eagerly sought all that could cause her suffering. At first, she fled human contact; and suspected of being possessed, was jailed. Upon her release, she took up the practice of extreme penance. Saint Christina the Astonishing (Mirabilis) front of prayer card from 1892 confirming by the Bishop Victor-Josephus that her relics were cared for by the Redemptorists - (Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer) and that her Saint Feast day is July 24th. Saint Christina the Astonishing (Mirabilis) back of prayer card from 1892. Thomas of Cantimpr√©, then a canon regular who was a professor of theology, wrote a report eight years after her death, based on accounts of those who knew her. Cardinal Jacques de Vitry, who met with her, said that she would throw herself into burning furnaces and there suffered great tortures for extended times, uttering frightful cries, yet coming forth with no sign of burns upon her. In winter she would plunge into the frozen Meuse River for hours and even days and weeks at a time, all the while praying to God and imploring God's mercy. She sometimes allowed herself to be carried by the currents downriver to a mill where the wheel \\"whirled her round in a manner frightful to behold\\", yet she never suffered any dislocations or broken bones. She was chased by dogs which bit her. Christina the Astonishing appearing in the 1630 Fasti Mariani calendar of saints - feast day July 24th back of card After being incarcerated a second time, she moderated her approach somewhat, upon her release. Christina died at the Dominican Monastery of Saint Catherine in Sint-Truiden, of natural causes, aged 74. The prioress there later testified that, despite her behaviour, Christina would humbly and fully obey any command given her by the prioress. \\"We have\\", says St. Robert Bellarmine, \\"reason for believing his testimony, since he has for guarantee another grave author, James de Vitry, Bishop and Cardinal, and because he relates what happened in his own time, and even in the province where he lived. Besides, the sufferings of this admirable virgin were not hidden. Everyone could see that she was in the midst of the flames without being consumed, and covered with wounds, every trace of which disappeared a few moments afterwards. But more than this was the marvellous life she led for forty-two years after she was raised from the dead, God clearly showing that the wonders wrought in her by virtue from on high. The striking conversions which she effected, and the evident miracles which occurred after her death, manifestly proved the finger of God, and the truth of that which, after her resurrection, she had revealed concerning the other life.\\" Saint Christina the Astonishing (Mirabilis) church photo with a caption reading \\"In pestilence, famine, and war, deliver us Lord - Saint Christina for your community intercede\\". Thus, argues Bellarmine, \\"God willed to silence those libertines who make open profession of believing in nothing, and who have the audacity to ask in scorn, Who has returned from the other world? Who has ever seen the torments of Hell or Purgatory? Behold two witnesses. They assure us that they have seen them and that they are dreadful. What follows, then, if not that the incredulous is inexcusable, and that those who believe and nevertheless neglect to do penance are still more to be condemned?\\" Modern interpretations While for some Christina's Vita is an example of credulous medieval superstition, historian Barbara Newman finds that there is reason to understand Christina's behavior in terms of hysteria.Newman, Barbara. \\"Possessed by the Spirit: Devout women, Demoniacs and the Apostolic Life in the Thirteenth Century\\", Speculum, 73, no.3 (1998) 764  Patronage  St. Christina the Astonishing has been recognized as a saint since the 12th century. She was placed in the calendar of the saints by at least two bishops of the Catholic Church in two different centuries (17th & 19th) that also recognized her life in a religious order and preservation of her relics. The Catholic Church allows and recognizes veneration of saints upheld by the laity; canonization is understood as a re-affirming of the more notable examples of Christian life as mentioned in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and Saint Christina the Astonishing, having early Church recognition, is due her title of Saint as stated by the Church's Magisterium and Sacred Tradition. Veneration of Christina the Astonishing has never been formally approved by the Catholic Church, but there remains a strong devotion to her in her native region of Limburg. Prayers are traditionally said to Christina to seek her intercession for millers, for those suffering from mental illness, and for mental health workers.

Background Wu Han, who wrote the play, was a historian (and a municipal politician in Beijing) who focused on the Ming Dynasty. In 1959, Wu Han became interested in the life of Hai Rui, a Ming minister who was imprisoned for criticizing the emperor. Wu Han wrote several articles on his life and his fearless criticism of the emperor. Wu then wrote a play for Peking Opera titled \\"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\\", which he revised several times before the final version of 1961.MacFarquhar 167 The play is a tragedy in which an honest official carries the complaints of the people to the emperor at the expense of his career. It portrays Hai as an efficient magistrate who requests an audience with the emperor. Hai then criticizes the Emperor directly for tolerating the corruption and abuses perpetuated by other officials in the imperial government. The emperor is so offended by Hai's criticism that he dismisses Hai from office.Domes 114-115 Hai is restored to office after the emperor dies.Rice 188 The play was published under Wu's pen name, Liu Mianzhi, the name of a Song dynasty scholar and a supporter of Yue Fei. The play enjoyed great success, and was initially praised by Mao Zedong. With a changing political climate, the play later came under severe criticism. Political significance After the play's initial performance, critics began to interpret it as an allegory for Peng Dehuai's criticism of Mao during the 1959 Lushan Conference, in which Peng's criticism of Mao's Great Leap Forward led Mao to purge Peng. According to this interpretation, Hai Rui is Peng, and the Ming Emperor is Mao. Peng himself agreed with this interpretation, and stated \\"I want to be a Hai Rui!\\" in a 1962 letter to Mao requesting his return to politics. After becoming convinced that Hai Rui was an allegory for Peng Dehuai, in 1965 Mao devised a long-term scheme to eliminate his chief rival within the Party, Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, by criticizing the writer of the play, Wu Han. By criticizing and removing Wu Han, Mao planned to criticize and remove his superior in Beijing, Peng Zhen, who was one of Liu Shaoqi's closest supporters, with the ultimate intention of criticizing and eliminating President Liu Shaoqi.Teiwes 91-92 At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, in 1966, Yao Wenyuan published an article criticizing the play based on the interpretation that the play, by portraying Peng's position sympathetically, was an attack on Chairman Mao. Wu Han became one of the first victims of the Cultural Revolution and died in prison in 1969. After Wu was purged, radical Maoists quickly purged other \\"rightists\\" from China's cultural institutions, and the theatre became an instrument for the Gang of Four to attack their political enemies. Peng Zhen and Liu Shaoqi were purged shortly after Wu Han, fulfilling Mao's political objectives. The playwright Wu Han was posthumously rehabilitated in 1979, shortly after Mao's death. Related work The theme was also the subject of a play written by Zhou Xinfang and with Xu Siyan (), Hai Rui Submits His Memorial (Êµ∑Áëû‰∏äÁñè, Hai Rui Shangshu), and the play was performed by the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe in 1959. Zhou Xinfang was also arrested and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and died in 1975. References Bibliography * Domes, Jurgen. Peng Te-huai: The Man and the Image, London: C.

His first leading role was in the independent action film Final Impact. Variety magazine labeled him a \\"promising newcomer\\". Signed to several films with PM Entertainment, he worked through a series of low-budget films before landing the role of \\"Tommy\\" on the TV series Acapulco H.E.A.T.. He was also one of the front-runners for the role of Robin in Batman Forever, although the role ultimately went to Chris O'Donnell. Worth ended up having a cameo alongside O'Donnell in one of the film's fight scenes (throwing the final kick at Robin in the alleyway). He also appeared in \\"The Storytellers\\" alongside Tippi Hedren. In 2004, he wrote and directed a micro-budget experimental film, titled Killing Cupid. It earned him a Best Director nomination at the Action On Film Film Festival in 2005 as well as \\"Best Fiction Film\\" at the \\"Hollywood Documentary and Fiction Film Festival\\" in 2006. He continued to act in a variety of small independent films while honing his skills as a filmmaker, ghostwriting for film and television, as well as directing second unit. Worth wrote the screenplays for and starred in the psychological thriller/western film Dual (2005) and the sci-fi/horror film Devil On The Mountain (2006). He also appeared in an episode of the CBS sitcom The King of Queens in 2005. In 2008, Worth was given the opportunity to write and direct a feature film. \\"God's Ears\\" was released in March 2008 at the Method Fest Independent Film Festival. Besides writing and directing the film, Worth also starred in it, playing a boxer with autism who falls in love with a dancer. Worth was nominated for a Breakout Acting Award at MethodFest 2008 for his performance as Noah Connely. Worth won the Best Director award at \\"The Las Vegas Film Festival\\" and God's Ears was the only US entry into the Skip City D-Cinema Film Festival in Japan, in 2009. He also won two awards at New York's Visionfest, \\"The Jack Nance Breakout Performance Award\\" and \\"The Domani Emerging Talent Award\\". Worth also directed the acclaimed world war 2 drama with Eric Stoltz, Fort Mccoy. Michael continues to act, write screenplays and direct films. His recent slate includes the anticipated comedy, Bring Me the Head of Lance Henriksen, Our Father, Broken Memories and the indie Romance, The Sugar Moon Tribe. Worth recently completed the films The Butterfly Guard (an MMA drama) and the final film of actor Rance Howard, Apple Seed, described as a \\"personal road trip movie about growing up and letting go\\" from Worth.

Details of his life are relatively sparse. He came from west Flanders, and served as choirmaster in Bonn sometime in the earlier portion of his life. By 1558 he had probably come to Italy, staying until 1562, and in 1565 he took the post of maestro di cappella at the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso, where he remained for over 40 years. A note in a publication of 1596 indicates that he still held the post of choirmaster there, and was living in Rome. Some of his music has survived, and unusually for a Roman composer, much of it is instrumental. He published a book of music for lute, which included not only 15 fantasias by himself, in tablature, but arrangements of pieces by Crist√≥bal de Morales, and Francesco Canova da Milano. Matelart also wrote sacred vocal music, including a series of responsories for four and five voices (1596). This collection includes 21 chants by Matelart himself, as well as music by other composers, including Clemens non Papa, Orlande de Lassus, Costanzo Festa, and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.

It works on an inclined plane to carry boats in individual cradles over a change of height of about . It is the only marine railway (or canal inclined plane) of its kind in North America still in use, and is overseen by federally operated Parks Canada.  History  In 1914, contracts were let to have 3 locks built to connect the Severn River to Georgian Bay at Port Severn, Big Chute, and Swift Rapids. With the start of World War I, however, there was a shortage of manpower and resources. Lock 45 at Port Severn was nearing completion, so it was finished as a small, \\"temporary\\" lock. (It remains in use to this day.) The locks at Big Chute and Swift Rapids were not completed, with \\"temporary\\" marine railways being built instead. The original Big Chute Marine Railway was completed in 1917, and could only carry boats up to long, preventing navigation by large commercial vessels. The Swift Rapids Marine Railway was completed in 1919, using the same plans as the Big Chute railway. In 1921, plans were once again made to build three locks at Big Chute, to be part of a new section of canal which would take boats from Big Chute and rejoin the existing waterway downstream from the Little Chute, avoiding the fast water in the Little Chute. However because of the post-war recession the scheme was put on hold once more, although remains of the beginning of the dams required to maintain the water levels can still be found in the surrounding forest. In 1923, the original railway at Big Chute was replaced, as the size and number of boats had increased, with the second carriage being able to carry boats up to long. The 1923 carriage was used up until around 2003, on days of extremely heavy traffic, or as a backup for the new carriage. Although the old carriage is no longer used, it remains on display. In the 1960s, surveys of the area were done yet again. The old, outdated Swift Rapids Marine Railway was replaced with a single conventional lock in 1964, and plans were made for a single lock at Big Chute. Before construction began the sea lamprey, which had been devastating the fishing industry in the Great Lakes, was found in Gloucester Pool‚Äîat the bottom of the railway‚Äîand plans were put on hold. Several impractical ideas were suggested, but no practical solution could be found. By the end of the 1960s, the old marine railway could not keep up with the amount of boating traffic in the area. Long lines formed at either end of the railway, with waits often being overnight. Research was done to find a way to prevent the migration of the sea lamprey into Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, while still effectively increasing the flow of traffic. A biologist sat at the bottom of the railway for days, checking the bottom of boats that locked through, and finally saw a lamprey attached to the bottom of a boat. The lamprey fell off after less than 6 meters, so the railway was determined to be effective at preventing the sea lamprey's migration. In 1976, it was finally decided that a new, enlarged railway would be built. The current carriage was opened to the public in 1978, and can carry a boat up to long and beam. It cost $3 million to build .  Operation  The vessels are floated into the cradle, which is approximately long by wide. Four electric motors provide traction by cable. It can transport up to a combined total of in weight. In this enlarged version the increased weight is borne on a dual track which keeps the carriage level (the front and back wheels are on different tracks, with the front of the carriage on the upper tracks. The carriage is kept horizontal due to the relative profile of the tracks. Toward the end of travel, the carriage assumes a slight \\"nose down\\" attitude as it submerges into the water. Boats rest on the bottom of the carriage, and webbing slings are provided to support boats safely and prevent them from tipping. The old system has been decommissioned by Parks Canada, to conform with modern safety standards, although the old tracks and carriage still remain. The last operation of the old system was in 2003.

Attack trees have been used in a variety of applications. In the field of information technology, they have been used to describe threats on computer systems and possible attacks to realize those threats. However, their use is not restricted to the analysis of conventional information systems. They are widely used in the fields of defense and aerospace for the analysis of threats against tamper resistant electronics systems (e.g., avionics on military aircraft).U.S. Department of Defense, \\"Defense Acquisition Guidebook\\", Section 8.5.3.3 Attack trees are increasingly being applied to computer control systems (especially relating to the electric power grid ).Chee-Wooi Ten, Chen-Ching Liu, Manimaran Govindarasu, Vulnerability Assessment of Cybersecurity for SCADA Systems Using Attack Trees, Attack trees have also been used to understand threats to physical systems. Some of the earliest descriptions of attack trees are found in papers and articles by Bruce Schneier, when he was CTO of Counterpane Internet Security. Schneier was clearly involved in the development of attack tree concepts and was instrumental in publicizing them. However, the attributions in some of the early publicly available papers on attack treesChris Salter, O. Sami Saydjari, Bruce Schneier, Jim Wallner, Toward a Secure System Engineering Methodology, also suggest the involvement of the National Security Agency in the initial development. Attack trees are very similar, if not identical, to threat trees. Threat trees were discussed in 1994 by Edward Amoroso. Basic Attack tree for computer viruses. Here we assume a system such as Windows NT, where not all users have full system access. All child nodes operate on OR conditions. Attack trees are multi-leveled diagrams consisting of one root, leaves, and children. From the bottom up, child nodes are conditions which must be satisfied to make the direct parent node true; when the root is satisfied, the attack is complete. Each node may be satisfied only by its direct child nodes. A node may be the child of another node; in such a case, it becomes logical that multiple steps must be taken to carry out an attack. For example, consider classroom computers which are secured to the desks. To steal one, the securing cable must be cut or the lock unlocked. The lock may be unlocked by picking or by obtaining the key. The key may be obtained by threatening a key holder, bribing a keyholder, or taking it from where it is stored (e.g. under a mousemat). Thus a four level attack tree can be drawn, of which one path is (Bribe Keyholder, Obtain Key, Unlock Lock, Steal Computer). An attack described in a node may require one or more of many attacks described in child nodes to be satisfied. Our above condition shows only OR conditions; however, an AND condition can be created, for example, by assuming an electronic alarm which must be disabled if and only if the cable will be cut. Rather than making this task a child node of cutting the lock, both tasks can simply reach a summing junction. Thus the path ((Disable Alarm, Cut Cable), Steal Computer) is created. Attack trees are related to the established fault tree formalism. Fault tree methodology employs boolean expressions to gate conditions when parent nodes are satisfied by leaf nodes. By including a priori probabilities with each node, it is possible to perform calculate probabilities with higher nodes using Bayes Rule. However, in reality accurate probability estimates are either unavailable or too expensive to gather. With respect to computer security with active participants (i.e., attackers), the probability distribution of events are probably not independent nor uniformly distributed, hence, naive Bayesian analysis is unsuitable. Since the Bayesian analytic techniques used in fault tree analysis cannot legitimately be applied to attack trees, analysts instead use other techniquesDonald L Buckshaw, Gregory S Parnell, Willard L Ulkenholz, Donald L Parks, James M Wallner, O. Sami Saydjari, Mission Oriented Design Analysis of Critical Information Systems, Military Operations Research V10, N2, 2005, Terrance R Ingoldsby, Amenaza Technologies Limited, Attack Tree-based Threat Risk Analysis, A vendor white paper, to determine which attacks will be preferred by a particular attacker. These may involve comparing the attacker's capabilities (time, money, skill, equipment) with the resource requirements of the specified attack. Attacks which are near or beyond the attacker's ability to perform are less preferred than attacks that are perceived as cheap and easy. The degree to which an attack satisfies the adversary's objectives also affects the attacker's choices. Attacks that are both within the adversary's capabilities, and which satisfy their goals, are more likely than those that do not. Examination Attack trees can become large and complex, especially when dealing with specific attacks. A full attack tree may contain hundreds or thousands of different paths all leading to completion of the attack. Even so, these trees are very useful for determining what threats exist and how to deal with them. Attack trees can lend themselves to defining an information assurance strategy. It is important to consider, however, that implementing policy to execute this strategy changes the attack tree. For example, computer viruses may be protected against by refusing the system administrator access to directly modify existing programs and program folders, instead requiring a package manager be used. This adds to the attack tree the possibility of design flaws or exploits in the package manager. One could observe that the most effective way to mitigate a threat on the attack tree is to mitigate it as close to the root as possible. Although this is theoretically sound, it is not usually possible to simply mitigate a threat without other implications to the continued operation of the system. For example, the threat of viruses infecting a Windows system may be largely reduced by using a standard (non- administrator) account and NTFS instead of FAT file system so that normal users are unable to modify the operating system. Implementing this negates any way, foreseen or unforeseen, that a normal user may come to infect the operating system with a virus; however, it also requires that users switch to an administrative account to carry out administrative tasks, thus creating a different set of threats on the tree and more operational overhead. Also, users are still able to infect files to which they have write permissions, which may include files and documents. Systems using cooperative agents that dynamically examine and identify vulnerability chains, creating attack trees, have been built since 2000.

It is nicknamed the \\"Giant Peanut\\" by some locals due to its peanut-shaped road layout. Geography Middlemount is located inland (by road) from Mackay and Rockhampton in Central Queensland. It is a mining town servicing three coal mines: Foxleigh, German Creek and world record holding underground coal mine Grasstree.  History  Middlemount, like many other mining towns in Queensland virtually sprung up overnight in the early 1980s. Middlemount Post Office opened on 2 June 1980. Middlemount State School opened in 1980 with a secondary department added in 1983. In 1988 the secondary department was separated from the primary school to create Middlemount State High School. However, on 1 January 2001, the schools were amalgamated to form Middlemount Community School. The Middlemount Library opened in 1984. Most of the housing is owned by Anglo Coal. The company operates and maintains some of the town's infrastructure. Most of the houses are almost identical, in this instance there are three types of houses; lowset L-shaped, lowset square and highset. Approximately 40,000 workes have been employed at Middlemount's coal mining over its 39 year history. This town has contributed to the economic development of Queensland and Australia more generally.. At the 2011 census, Middlemount had a population of 1,914. Mining The German Creek coal mine (or Capcoal), operated by Anglo Coal, is notable as having the deepest longwall coal mine in Queensland, and also for operating Australia's only 'thin-seam' underground coal mine, using technology from the United States. It has five producing underground mines (Central, Southern, Bundoora, Grasstree and Aquila) and two open cut (open pit) mines (Oak Park and Lake Lindsay, both in neighbouring Mackenzie River). Central and Southern mines are no longer operating, Southern has become Grasstree West in 2006 and Central Closed in 2004. Aquila mine is currently in \\"Care & Maintenance\\" mode, pending changes to the coal market prices. The Foxleigh coal mine (also in Mackenzie River) used to be a joint venture between Anglo American, POSCO and Nippon Steel It is currently producing around three million tonnes of coal for the export market. Anglo American announced that it had completed the sale of its 70% interest in the Foxleigh metallurgical coal mine in Queensland, Australia to a consortium led by Taurus Fund Management, following the announcement of the sale and purchase agreement on 4 April 2016. Local attractions Middlemount has a small shopping complex which contains an IGA store, a butchery, an Australian Post Office, a jewellery and gift store, clothing store 'The Vault', a medical centre, a chemist, an ANZ bank, a bakery, 'Lemon Tree' takeaway store and cafe, a hairdressers, and a news agency. The 'Leisure Centre' located across the parking lot from the shopping centre contains 'Hot Rocks' pizza and takeaway store and cafe, a gym, and a hairdressers. Middlemount also has a pub with a Bottle-O drive-through, a local hall, a restaurant and hotel motel 'The Swag', a skatepark, a local pool, and a golf club. Isaac Regional Council operate a public library in Middlemount in the shopping centre. Education The Middlemount Community School is co- educational government primary and secondary school (P-12) in James Randell Drive. In 2015, the school had an enrolment of 373 students with 32 teachers (29 full-time equivalent). Students in Years 9-12 can also study subjects unavailable at the school through the School of Distance Education.  Notable residents  Some of Middlemount's notable former residents are Olympic cyclists Anna Meares and Kerrie Meares.

The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden () is a fresco by the Italian Early Renaissance artist Masaccio. The fresco is a single scene from the cycle painted around 1425 by Masaccio, Masolino and others on the walls of the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. It depicts the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden, from the biblical Book of Genesis chapter 3, albeit with a few differences from the canonical account. Possible sources of inspiration Many possible sources of inspiration have been pointed out that Masaccio may have drawn from. For Adam, possible references include numerous sculptures of Marsyas (from Greek Mythology) and certain crucifix done by Donatello. For Eve, art analysts usually point to different versions of Venus Pudica, such as Prudence by Giovanni Pisano. Cover up and restoration Three centuries after the fresco was painted, Cosimo III de' Medici, in line with contemporary ideas of decorum, ordered that fig leaves be added to conceal the genitals of the figures. These were eventually removed in the 1980s when the painting was fully restored and cleaned. The scene in its context in the chapel. Influence on Michelangelo Masaccio provided a large inspiration to the more famous Renaissance painter Michelangelo, due to the fact that Michelangelo's teacher, Domenico Ghirlandaio, looked almost exclusively to him for inspiration for his religious scenes. Ghirlandaio also imitated various designs done by Masaccio. This influence is most visible in Michelangelo's The Fall of Man and the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Differences from Genesis The main points in this painting that deviate from the account as it appears in Genesis: # Adam and Eve are shown in the nude. Although this increases the drama of the scene, it differs from Genesis 3:21 (KJV) which states, \\"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the God make coats of skins, and clothed them.\\" # Only one Cherub angel is present. Genesis 3:24 states, \\"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, [...]\\" (-im being the original Hebrew plural ending of Cherub, doubled with an English plural in this version). # The arch depicted at the garden entrance does not appear in the Biblical account. However, since artists often followed the studio tradition, painting from previous versions of a scene--and so learning from and absorbing other artists' expressive inventions into their own work--any responsible iconographic study would founder in the shallows of literal expectation if the painting were only judged by its adherence to these details and therefore seen to be successful only if it functioned as a simple illustration for the scene. Masaccio's evocation of Eve's howling, deeply felt pain in particular explores the meaning of the expulsion on a previously unexamined, more personal level. In 2nd Temple Jewish texts, however, Adam is described as glorious (Sirach 49, &c.;), and in both some Rabbinic and Christian Patristic sources, there is a long tradition of reading the Hebrew word for \\"skin\\" as \\"light\\" (there is only one slight difference in the vowels between the two words), and taking the Genesis 3:21 words about God clothing the pair in the Pluperfect sense, such as Sebastian Brock has shown is done in the Syriac tradition. In Rabbinic sources there are several times when Adam is compared and contrasted with Moses, particularly in terms of Moses' luminosity after ascending the mountain, and at least one text where Moses claims that his glory is greater than Adam's, because he did not lose his glory (Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:3); Genesis Rabbah 20:12 notes that Rabbi Meir had a scroll that had \\"light\\" instead of skin. The same tradition is found in Ephrem the Syrian, who, in his Hymns on Paradise 6, talks about Christ clothing the faithful in the robe that Adam lost with the transgression. The Canon of St. Andrew of Crete has the cantor liken himself to Adam, and say \\"I have found myself stripped naked of God\\". Bede, in his commentary On Genesis, has similar comments: \\"having lost the glory of innocence by their transgression, they claimed for themselves the garment of an excuse\\". The \\"stripped of divinity/glory/innocence/honor motif is thus found in the Latin, Greek, and Syriac traditions of the Church. It seems quite possible that these artists were working within this very old tradition that stretches across traditions.

According to Gregorovius, he was a \\"maverick\\" in the great Pierleoni family, for he continued to oppose the papacy after Anacletus' death, when the rest of his clan had returned to support of Rome. In late autumn 1143, the democratic element in Rome set up a Senate in opposition to the higher nobility and the papacy. Drawing on the glorious ancient Roman Republic, the citizens declared a senate, based on four elected representatives from each of the newly created fourteen districts of medieval Rome, the first real senators since the seventh century. The fifty-six senators then elected as patrician Pierleoni, because the title of consul had taken on noble connotations. Pierleoni led the defence of the city against Pope Lucius II's assault in 1145, where Lucius himself was killed. However, Pierleoni could not maintain order in the city and, despite his overtures of negotiations with Lucius--demanding the pope renounce secular authority and live as a common priest before being allowed reentry into the city, --he was deposed by the people, who invited Pope Eugene III, Lucius' successor, back. The power vacuum left by Pierleoni's deposition caused even more anarchy and eventually the pope left and a less illustrious man than Giordano, Giacomo da Vico, was elected patrician--though a man his equal, Arnold of Brescia, had arrived in the commune in 1145. Arnold would renew the commune, giving it the intellectual leadership it lacked after Pierleoni's downfall. Sources *Gregorovius, Ferdinand.

In his search for a cure, he became an adept of homeopathy, which he practiced in such places as Sicily and Malta, before settling in Brazil in 1840. He attempted to expand his activities in 1842, by creating an Institute in Sa√≠, Santa Catarina (Instituto Homeop√°tico de Sa√≠) training locals in homeopathy, which he saw as a weapon in combatting the endemic diseases within underprivileged communities, especially the Afro-Brazilian one. Inspired by the utopian socialism of Charles Fourier, Mure also created a Phalanst√®re near S√£o Francisco do Sul (Falanst√©rio do Sa√≠ or Col√¥nia Industrial do Sa√≠), which expanded to surrounding areas such as Vila da Gl√≥ria (Col√¥nia do Palmital). He received backing from Antero Ferreira de Brito and the rest of Santa Catarina's government of the period, but the project was not to survive. He left for Rio de Janeiro in 1843, and founded the Instituto Homeop√°tico do Brasil, serving as its president until 1848 (when he returned to Europe). In 1852, he started homeopathical activities in Cairo, Alexandria, and other areas of Egypt (including Turkiyah Sudan). He died there six years later.

As a result of the attainder, his son, Richard Welles, 7th Baron Welles, did not succeed him in the barony of Welles until the attainder was reversed by Parliament in June 1467. Family Born about 1406, Lionel Welles was the son of Eudes Welles and Maud Greystoke. On his father's side, he was the grandson of John de Welles, 5th Baron Welles (d. 26 August 1421), and Eleanor Mowbray, and on his mother's side, the grandson of Ralph de Greystoke, 3rd Baron Greystoke and Katherine Clifford, daughter of Roger de Clifford, 5th Baron de Clifford. He had one brother, Sir William Welles, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Career Lionel Welles' father, Eudes Welles, died sometime before 26 July 1417, predeceasing his own father, the 5th Baron. At the death of the 5th Baron in 1421, Lionel Welles thus inherited the Welles barony and lands, but as he was underage, his wardship was granted to his future father-in-law, Robert Waterton (d.1425), a 'trusted retainer of John of Gaunt and the Lancastrian Kings'. He was knighted at the Parliament at Leicester by the infant Henry VI on 19 May 1426, and had control of his lands on 5 December 1427. He accompanied Henry VI to France in 1430, was summoned to Parliament from 25 February 1432 to 30 July 1460 by writs directed to Leoni de Welles, and was a privy councillor before 12 November 1434. In 1436 he was with Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, in the expedition sent to relieve the siege of Calais. He was a member of Henry VI's household before February 1438. From 12 February 1438 he resided in Ireland as Lord Lieutenant; according to Hicks, he 'failed to control the contending factions and resigned prematurely in 1442'. In 1441 he was particularly embarrassed at his inability to prosecute Thomas FitzGerald, the Prior of the Knights Hospitallers at Kilmainham, whom he accused of being party to the kidnapping of Lionel's brother William. The Prior produced a royal pardon, and no action was taken against him; nor would he release William until certain demands were met. His dealings, together with his kinsmen Robert Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby de Eresby and Ralph, Lord Cromwell, towards a servant of William Tailboys at Boston, Lincolnshire are complained of in a letter earlier than 1450 to the Viscount Beaumont among the Paston Letters.J. Gairdner (ed.), The Paston Letters 1422-1509 A.D., Library Edition (Chatto & Windus, London 1904), II, No. 100, pp. 118-20. Together with Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, he served as Joint Deputy of Calais for his brother-in-law, Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who was Lieutenant of Calais from 1451 to 1455, and apparently remained at Calais until 20 April 1456, when Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, took over as Lieutenant. Despite these appointments, according to Hicks, Welles was 'essentially a Lincolnshire landowner'; he was a Justice of the Peace and served on other commissions in that county. St Oswald's church, Methley, near Leeds He was installed, together with John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, as a Knight of the Garter on 14 May 1457, and in October of that year was sent with English reinforcements to Calais. He was taken prisoner by Yorkist forces at the Battle of Blore Heath on 23 September 1459. In 1461 he was with the army of Queen Margaret, which advanced on London, and won the Second Battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461. He was slain a month later at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, though rumours of his survival ran about.Gairdner (ed.), Paston Letters, III, Nos. 450, 451, pp. 266-69. After his death he was attained by Act of Parliament on 21 December 1461, whereby all his honours were forfeited. He was buried with his first wife, Joan Waterton, in the Waterton Chapel in St Oswald's parish church at Methley, Yorkshire, where they have a fine table-tomb monument with recumbent effigies.Detail at leodis.net. Welles is shown in full armour with a lion at his feet. Marriages and issue Welles married firstly Jane (in some accounts, Cecily) Waterton, daughter of Robert Waterton, esquire, of Waterton, Lincs. and Methley, Yorkshire, and his wife, Cecily Fleming, daughter of Sir Robert Fleming of Woodhall (brother of Richard Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln), by whom he had one son and four daughters: *Richard Welles, 7th Baron Welles. *Cecily Welles, who married Sir Robert Willoughby of Parham, Suffolk and was the mother of Christopher Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. *Margaret Welles (d. 13 July 1480), who married first, Sir Thomas Dymoke (executed 12 March 1470), and secondly Robert Radcliffe, esquire. *Eleanor Welles (died before 1504), who married first, Thomas Hoo, Baron Hoo and Hastings (d. 13 February 1455); secondly Sir James Laurence (died 1490);The National Archives (UK), Discovery Catalogue, ref.

The current bridge fully opened to traffic in October 2016, replacing a previous plate girder bridge. It is part of the Interstate 90 route. There is another automobile crossing a few miles south of this bridge; the Mississippi River Bridge, a combination of two bridges, and the La Crosse West Channel Bridge, connecting La Crescent, Minnesota and La Crosse, Wisconsin. The bridge consists of a pair of parallel, concrete box girder structures over the main river channel and precast concrete girder structures over the back channels. The bridges were completed with a cost of $185.5 million, and have the following specifications: *100-year design life *Length: *Width: varies between *Two lanes each direction *Eastbound acceleration lane * outside shoulders * inside shoulders The bridge connects to the I-90/US 14/US 61 interchange, and provides access to the Dresbach Rest Area/MN Welcome Center and boat launches from westbound I-90. The westbound I-90 to southbound US 14/US 61 interchange has a fly-under ramp allowing continuous movement with no competing traffic. History The previous bridge was a plate girder bridge completed in 1967; the steel structure was painted dark green, and the bridge had a concrete railing. Although the previous bridge had no weight restrictions and operated at an acceptable level of service at the time of replacement, there were a number of problems with the bridge and surrounding roadways: * The deck was deteriorating, the most pressing issue in the short term. * The bridge was of an obsolete, non-redundant structural design similar to that of the Hoan Bridge in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which suffered a substantial structural failure. After the Hoan Bridge incident, the I-90 Mississippi River Bridge was hurriedly inspected and found to be in satisfactory condition, but concern about the basic steel structural design remained. * A lack of standard shoulders inhibited emergency responses to incidents on the bridge and did not provide enough room for disabled vehicles to get out the traffic lanes. * There were issues with the interchange on the Minnesota side, including a curve on the main travel lanes that was sharper than desirable for an interstate; a confusing design; and congestion on some of the ramps. * There were capacity problems at the Dresbach Rest Area on the Minnesota side, which had limited room for expansion. Compounding the problem, it was accessible from the eastbound direction, even though it was intended for westbound traffic only. * There were no provisions for bicyclists and pedestrians on the bridge. In 2006, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) commissioned a study on ways to rectify some or all of these issues. Some of the options that were presented included: * Replacing the deck only, estimated cost $23 million. * Widening and rebuilding the existing structure with either additional piers or strengthening the foundation, estimated cost $40‚Äì$58 million. * Building a new westbound girder bridge and converting the existing bridge to eastbound only, estimated cost $63 million. * Building a new girder bridge, extradosed bridge, or cable stayed bridge, and demolishing the existing one, estimated cost $59‚Äì$71 million. In addition, the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, on August 1, 2007 led to the effort by MnDOT to replace or modify \\"fracture-critical\\" bridges in the state. A concrete box girder bridge design was ultimately selected; with construction beginning January 2013.

Blanton Museum of Art (often referred to as the Blanton or the BMA) at the University of Texas at Austin is one of the largest university art museums in the U.S. with 189,340 square feet devoted to temporary exhibitions, permanent collection galleries, storage, administrative offices, classrooms, a print study room, an auditorium, shop, and cafe. The Blanton's permanent collection consists of almost 18,000 works, with significant holdings of modern and contemporary art, Latin American art, Old Master paintings, and prints and drawings from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. History The museum was founded in 1963 as the University Art Museum on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The University Art Museum was initially housed in the Art Department of the University of Texas (though supervision of the museum was later moved to the Office of the Provost) and was founded through the proceeds from the sale of land donated by Archer M. Huntington. This land was donated with the stipulation that it be used to support an art museum at the University. In 1964, Donald Goodall became the museum's first director. By 1972, a portion of the museum's collection was housed at the Harry Ransom Humanities Center, while the print study room and temporary exhibition galleries remained at the Art Department. In 1979, Eric S. McCready became the museum's second director, and the museum was renamed the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery shortly thereafter. In 1993, Jessie Otto Hite became the museum's third director. In 1994, Mari Yoriko Sabusawa, wife of novelist James Michener, gifted $5 million for the construction of a new museum complex, which would be the first dedicated space for the museum's permanent collection since its founding. The campaign to build a new building began in 1997 with a $12 million gift from the Houston Endowment, Inc. in honor of its then-chairman, Jack S. Blanton. The museum was renamed the Blanton Museum of Art, with construction on the new building commencing in 2003. Although the museum was built as designed by Kallmann McKinnell & Wood Architects, they were not the first architectural firm hired for the project. The notable Swiss-based architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron had originally been commissioned for the project, but resigned the commission in 1999 due to differences in their design and the wishes of the Board of Regents regarding the university's Campus Master Plan. Lawrence Speck, disappointed in the series of events that led to Herzog & de Meuron's resignation, resigned as dean of the School of Architecture, although he remains a faculty member. The new gallery building, named the Mari and James A. Michener Gallery Building, opened to the public with a 24-hour marathon celebration in 2006. A second education and administration building (the Edgar A. Smith Building), totaling 56,000 square feet, opened in 2008. In 2009, Ned Rifkin was named to replace the retiring Jessie Otto Hite as director. In 2011, Simone Wicha was named director. Collections The Blanton's permanent collection of almost 18,000 works is recognized for its European paintings, prints and drawings, and modern and contemporary American and Latin American art. =European art before 1900= The collection of European paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts before 1900 includes the Suida-Manning Collection of over 275 works, with paintings by Parmigianino, Paolo Veronese, Tiepolo, Rubens, Claude Lorrain, and Simon Vouet, along with many other European artists from the 15th through 18th centuries. The collection also includes works by lesser-known, but still historically significant, painters such as Daniele Crespi and Luca Cambiaso. While the Suida-Manning Collection predominantly showcases Italian and French artists, eighteenth-century English painting is represented by a group of portraits bequeathed by Jack G. Taylor, including George Romney's Lady Hamilton (1791). The Blanton owns a collection of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman vases, the earliest of which date to the sixth century BCE. Many came from the Castle Ashby Collection formed by the Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton, who funded numerous excavations at Vulci, an Etruscan town north of Rome, during the 1820s. =Modern and contemporary art= Statues at the Blanton Museum of Art The Blanton's modern and contemporary art holdings comprise more than 4,000 objects. Novelist James Michener, and his wife, Mari Michener, began giving their collection of 20th-century American paintings to the Blanton in the 1960s. The gift spanned into the early 1990s and eventually totaled more than 300 works. The Micheners also gave acquisition funds to the museum, supporting the purchase of approximately 75 additional paintings. The museum's collection includes 20th-century artists such as Thomas Hart Benton, Alice Neel, and Brice Marden. The Blanton's collection of contemporary art also includes works by El Anatsui, Teresa Hubbard / Alexander Birchler, Natalie Frank, Nina Katchadourian, Byron Kim, Yayoi Kusama, Glenn Ligon, Donald Moffett, Susan Philipsz, and Tavares Strachan. In 2009, Stacked Waters, an installation by artist Teresita Fern√°ndez commissioned by Jeanne and Michael Klein, debuted in the Rapoport Atrium of the Blanton Museum. In 2014, the Blanton acquired an important group of drawings, prints, and a major painting by the African-American artist Charles White from Drs. Susan G. and Edmund W. Gordon. =Latin American art= Shortly after his appointment as founding director of the University of Texas Art Museum in Austin in 1959, Donald Goodall acquired for the Blanton what was at that time the largest collection of Latin American art in the United States. The Latin American collection expanded significantly in the 1970s and 1980s with gifts from collector Barbara Duncan of 277 works of art, including 58 paintings and 112 drawings. The museum was the first institution in the United States to create a curatorial position for Latin American art in 1988. The founding curator of the department was Mari Carmen Ram√≠rez who acquired one of the signature works in the Latin American collection, Cildo Meireles' Miss√£o/Miss√µes: How to Build Cathedrals (1987). The museum received a notable addition of Latin American modern and midcentury Latin American art from collectors Judy and Charles Tate in 2015. The 114-object collection includes paintings, sculptures, and drawings by Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, Tarsila do Amaral, Rufino Tamayo, Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a, Wifredo Lam, Armando Reveron, Jesus Rafael Soto, and Lygia Clark, among others. =The Julia Matthews Wilkinson Center for Prints and Drawings= The Julia Matthews Wilkinson Center for Prints and Drawings houses most of the Blanton's 16,000 works on paper. The Center also includes the H.E.B. print study room, a library, and curatorial offices. The Center's holdings reflect the Blanton's fifty-year focus on three specific collecting areas: European art from 1450-1800, Latin American art after 1960, and American art of the 20th century. The Wilkinson Center's holdings include over 380 drawings from the Suida-Manning Collection, which are mostly pre-1800 Italian, including drawings by Raphael, Correggio, and Guercino. Also representing European art from this period is the Leo Steinberg Collection of almost 3,500 prints, including early impressions by Hendrick Goltzius, Claude Lorrain, and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione. The Center's holdings in contemporary Latin American art feature several thousand works from eighteen Latin American countries and includes 230 works on paper from the Barbara Duncan Collection of Latin American Art. Prints and drawings by American artists since 1900 comprise about twenty-five percent of the Blanton's holdings on paper. Julia and Stephen Wilkinson and their Still Water Foundation gave over 1030 prints, primarily wood engravings from the first half of the 20th century tied to the tradition of social realism. Among them are 757 prints by Clare Leighton, best known for her images of rural workers. =Western American art= The C.R. Smith Collection of Western American Art is a collection of 91 works given to the Blanton between 1968 and 1988. The collection includes works by Oscar E. Berninghaus, Albert Bierstadt, Solon H. Borglum, Dean Cornwell, Maynard Dixon, Henry Farny, Thomas Hill, Ransome Gillett Holdridge, Peter Hurd, Frank Tenney Johnson, Tom Lea, William Robinson Leigh, Alfred Jacob Miller, and Thomas Moran. =Ellsworth Kelly's Austin= In January 2015, the artist Ellsworth Kelly gave the Blanton the design concept for a stone building that he subsequently named Austin. This work of art relates to the tradition of modernist artist-commissioned buildings that includes Rothko Chapel and Henri Matisse's Matisse Chapel. Kelly said that the design of the building was inspired by Romanesque and Byzantine art he studied while in Paris on the G.I. Bill. Following Kelly's gift, the Blanton launched a $15 million campaign to realize the project. Austin opened February 18, 2018, with a ceremony featuring University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves, Austin Mayor Steve Adler, and museum director Simone Wicha. = SoundSpace = SoundSpace is a hybrid performance series that takes place at the Blanton three times per year. The series features simultaneous, interdisciplinary performances throughout the museum and has received awards from the Austin Critic's Table, the Austin Chronicle, and profiled at the annual SXSW Festival. SoundSpace has featured Graham Reynolds, Adrian Quesada, Thor Harris, and Panoramic Voices, among others. The series is directed by Austin artist Steve Parker and underwritten by local arts patron Mike Chesser.

In 2006, he ran for the United States Senate in Washington state on the Green Party ticket. Background As an adolescent, Dixon marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to end housing discrimination in Seattle, and was one of the first volunteers to participate in the busing program to integrate schools. The assassination of Martin Luther King deeply affected Dixon and propelled him towards the Black Power Movement. In April 1968, Dixon and his brother Elmer were in San Francisco for the West Coast Black Student Union conference, and during that time attended the funeral of Bobby Hutton, a member of the Black Panther Party killed in a confrontation with the police. Following the funeral, Dixon met with some of the Black Panther leadership such as Bobby Seale and Kathleen Cleaver, who made a vivid impression upon him. The time spent in San Francisco lead the Dixon brothers to set up the first Black Panther chapter outside of California in Seattle. While a member of the Black Panthers, Dixon started the Free Breakfast for Children program that fed thousands of hungry African American children; and he helped to open a free community medical and legal clinic. The clinic continues to this day as the Carolyn Downs Clinic, now part of Country Doctor Community Health Center. At the same time, according to the Seattle Weekly, the Panthers were involved in the \\"firebombing [of] businesses and institutions that they considered racist.\\" Dixon also became involved in electoral politics when he worked on the mayoral campaign of Lionel Wilson, who was elected as the first black mayor of Oakland, California in 1977. After leaving the Panthers, Dixon worked for several non-profit organizations, focusing on drug and gang violence and working with homeless youth. In 2002, he founded Central House, a non-profit providing transitional housing for homeless young adults. Central House also has a Youth Leadership Project that operates at four Seattle public high schools. It teaches youth to think positively, graduate high school, and control their own destinies. It also teaches them the importance of serving their community. Dixon is the father of six and lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 2006 United States Senate race On March 9, 2006, Dixon announced his decision to seek the Green Party's nomination for U.S. Senate, challenging Maria Cantwell on her continued support for the U.S. presence in Iraq and the USA PATRIOT Act. His platform included a call for immediate withdrawal from Iraq, the repeal of the PATRIOT Act, support of same-sex marriage, to implement a system of universal single-payer health care, to end the war on drugs and bring back attention to the issue of poverty. On April 8, 2006, the Dixon campaign officially kicked off its campaign with a 350-person event at the Garfield Community Center, where he raised US$4,000. Speakers included Amy Hagopian and Elaine Brown. On May 13, 2006, Dixon was overwhelmingly nominated as the Green Party of Washington State's nominee for the U.S. Senate. On July 10, 2006, the Secretary of State's office announced that the Dixon campaign had gathered the appropriate nomination signatures and that Aaron Dixon would appear on the November ballot. Also appearing on the ballot were Libertarian nominee Bruce Guthrie, independent candidate Robin Adair and, after September 19 primary victories, incumbent Democrat, Maria Cantwell and Republican challenger, Mike McGavick. =Endorsements and criticisms= Positive reactions to Dixon's candidacy have come from some local progressives, peace activists, gay rights activists and community leaders, as well as Republican Chairwoman Diane Tebelius.Modie, Neil, \\"As an Anti-war Candidate, Dixon Says he is no Spoiler\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, March 9, 2006 Negative reactions from other Democrats cited the \\"spoiler effect\\". Dixon denies that he is a spoiler, arguing that Cantwell's support for the 2003 Iraq War meant that he would draw anti-war voters that would not support Cantwell. Dixon's entrance into what many speculated would be a tightly contested race captured immediate media attention and was quickly endorsed by Brita Butler-Wall, the President of the Seattle School Board and Sally Soriano, a fellow Board director, Amy Hagopian, the President of the Garfield High School PTSA, as well as Olympia city councilman T.J. Johnson, Ralph Nader's 2004 running mate, Peter Miguel Camejo, former chairperson of the Black Panther Party Elaine Brown, Malik Rahim, founder of the Common Ground Collective and Todd Chretien, organizer of the San Francisco Proposition I/College Not Combat initiative and 2006 Green Party candidate for U.S. Senate in California. Dixon faced criticism for having criminal charges on his record, most for traffic violations, and owing the city and county substantial fines as a result. Public records circulated by perennial candidate Richard Pope also showed that Dixon owed several thousand dollars to a former spouse for child support payments. Dixon described these as additional costs in addition to his agreed payments, and indicated he was working to pay the debt.Parrish, Geov. \\"Aaron Dixon's Voting Record \\" Seattle Weekly April 6, 2006. In August 2006, the Dixon campaign won the endorsement of some prominent anti-war activists, including Anthony Arnove, author of Iraq: the Logic of Withdrawal and co-author (with Howard Zinn) of Voices of a People's History of the United States. On September 25, CounterPunch reported that the Dixon campaign had been contacted in July by former candidate and Cantwell campaign staffer, Mark Wilson, with the implication of large donations to Dixon's non-profit, Central House if he were to withdraw his candidacy before filing. According to Dixon, \\"Mark [Wilson] called and basically told me that a lot of people have a lot of money within the Cantwell campaign, and he said that they could put on a fundraiser for Central House that would 'blow my mind'. He called a week later and basically told me the same thing. I didn't bite, ending this war is too important.\\" Dixon claims that Wilson was not the only Cantwell staffer to call his campaign headquarters with the hope of convincing him to drop out of the race, but Dixon declined to name other names. In response, Cantwell campaign spokeswoman Katharine Lister said she did not know of any staffer in contact with Dixon and said no one on the campaign \\"was authorized to speak with Mr. Dixon about his candidacy\\". =October 17 debate exclusion and arrest= Aaron Dixon and supporters protesting exclusion from KING-5 debates On October 17, 2006, Dixon was arrested for trespassing at KING-5 television studio in Seattle, in protest of his exclusion from the televised U.S. Senate debate being filmed there. A KING video of the arrest showed Aaron Dixon being led out of the lobby by officers and then placed in the back of a police car in handcuffs, as dozens of his supporters chanted \\"Let him go!\\" Seattle Police confirmed that someone was arrested for trespassing, but declined to immediately release the person's name. Dixon did not meet the sponsors' criteria of public support or fundraising to participate in the debate, which was put on by KING, KREM-TV of Spokane, The Seattle Times, the Northwest News Network and the Seattle City Club. To take part, candidates had to have garnered 10 percent of the tally in a scientific poll; be the nominated candidate of a party that won 10 percent of the vote in the last election; or have raised at least $1.2 million. Libertarian candidate Bruce Guthrie mortgaged his home to come up with the money. He said during the debate that all five candidates should have been allowed to take part. After the arrest, about 50 Dixon supporters marched several blocks from the television station to the Seattle Police Department's west precinct. They then marched back to the television station, where they rejoined a crowd of political activists. More than 40 supporters of Cantwell and McGavick camped outside during the debate, waving signs and yelling campaign slogans. =Election results= Maria Cantwell (D) 1,184,659 - 56.8527% Mike McGavick (R) 832,106 - 39.9334% Bruce Guthrie (L) 29,331 - 1.4076% Aaron Dixon (G) 21,254 - 1.0200% Robin Adair (I) 16,384 votes - 0.7863% Post-campaign In the months following the campaign, Dixon reorganized much of the campaign's organization into the Center for Social Justice, based out of the campaign's former headquarters in Seattle's Central district. The Center organized an anti-war rally and march on January 27, 2007 in Seattle, which had a turnout of several thousand. In 2012, Dixon published a memoir, My People Are Rising: Memoir of a Black Panther Party Captain.Aaron Dixon, My People Are Rising: Memoir of a Black Panther Party Captain(2012), Haymarket Books. .

A Democrat, he served in the Louisiana State Senate during 1948 and in the United States House of Representatives from 1949 to 1969. Willis served on the U.S. House of Representative's Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Early life Willis was born in Arnaudville in St. Landry Parish, the eleventh of twelve children of Olanda Willis and the former Julia Hardy. He graduated from St. Martinville High School in St. Martin Parish. In 1926, Willis obtained credentials from the law school of Loyola University College of Law in New Orleans. He began his law practice in New Orleans and also owned and operated a plantation in St. Martin Parish near Lafayette. Political career He was elected to the Louisiana state Senate in 1948 but served only a few months because he later in the same year won election to Congress to succeed James R. Domengeaux, who left the House to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Russell B. Long won the Senate seat that Domengeaux contested. In November 1948, Willis faced Republican opposition from a wealthy New Iberia businessman. Jean (pronounced JOHN) Paulin Duhe (1885-1961), was the president of the New Iberia National Bank, head of the Duhe-Bourgeois Sugar Company, president of the Edmundson-Duhe rice mill, third vice-president of the American Sugar Cane League, and the president of the St. Martin-Iberia-St. Mary Flood Control Association. Willis defeated Duhe, 26,587 votes (66.6 percent) to Duhe's 13,337 ballots (33.4 percent). Duhe's margin was similar to that of a previous Republican candidate in the Third District, David W. Pipes, Jr., who contested the position in 1940, when he was defeated by Domengeaux. Willis held the congressional seat for ten terms. He was the chairman of the Committee on Un-American Activities during the 88th, 89th, and 90th congresses (1963-1969). He supported anti-communist Cold War laws, such as the McCarran-Walter Internal Security Act of 1950. Willis was in effect the last chairman of the HUAC, which was reconstituted as the Committee on Internal Security in 1969. During the 1960s, Willis viewed both the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War as reflections of communist influences. Having been a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also spoke out against the radicalism of the Ku Klux Klan. In Congress, Willis sought to secure subsidies for sugar planters. He successfully sponsored legislation to obtain federal funds for the protective levee in the Morganza Spillway in Pointe Coupee Parish. With his colleagues, he fought for federal royalty payments to the State of Louisiana from tideland oil revenues. In 1964, Willis defeated Republican Robert Angers (1919-1988), a newspaperman who published the award-winning Franklin Banner-Tribune of St. Mary Parish and in 1968 established Acadiana Profile magazine. A former Democrat, Angers switched parties in 1960Robert John Angers, A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, Lafayette: Louisiana Historical Association, 1999, pp. 4-5 and supported the gubernatorial and presidential candidacies of Charlton Lyons and Barry Goldwater in 1964 election. Willis easily gained another term with 52,532 votes (62.3 percent) to Angers's 31,806 ballots (37.7 percent). Though he carried no parishes in his campaign, Angers nearly won in the largest parish in the district-- Lafayette--where he procured 49.6 percent of the vote and outpolled Goldwater by 3.5 percentage points.State of Louisiana, Secretary of State, Election returns, November 3, 1964, U.S. House, Third District In 1966, though he had suffered a series of strokes, Willis still defeated Lafayette oilman Hall Lyons, the son of then Republican state chairman and former gubernatorial candidate Charlton Lyons of Shreveport. Willis received 46,533 votes (59.7 percent) to Lyons' 31,444 (40.3 percent). Lyons, who ran on a staunchly conservative platform, carried Iberia Parish with 51.4 percent of the vote and received 46 percent in Lafayette Parish. Hall Lyons later left the Republican Party and was the American Independent nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1972.State of Louisiana, Secretary of State, Election returns, November 8, 1966, U.S. House, Third District In retrospect, 1966 was a warning to Willis about his electoral future. Willis supported United States President Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Hubert Humphrey in the 1964 and 1968 campaigns. He compiled a generally liberal voting record in Congress according to Louisiana standards, similar to those of Hale Boggs of New Orleans and James H. Morrison of Hammond. Willis' record was in sharp contrast to the conservative records of longtime colleagues Otto E. Passman of Monroe and Joe D. Waggonner of Plain Dealing, and those later compiled by Speedy O. Long of Jena and John R. Rarick of St. Francisville. But Willis was not nearly as liberal as Gillis Long of Alexandria, who represented the eighth district from 1963 to 1965 and again from 1973 until his death in January 1985. In 1968, he was denied renomination by a Moderate Democrat, Patrick T. Caffery of New Iberia. Willis' health problems may have contributed to his defeat. Caffery won the general election and held the seat until January 1973, when, having decided to retire from political office, he was succeeded by Republican leader and future Governor David C. Treen, then of suburban Jefferson Parish. Caffery did not seek a third term in 1972 and returned to his New Iberia law practice. Personal life Willis married the former Estelle Bulliard on December 9, 1929. They had a son, Bobby Willis. Edwin Willis died October 24, 1972 in St. Martinville and is interred there in St. Michael's Cemetery, which is owned by the St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church. Willis died eight days after a plane carrying Hale Boggs disappeared over the Alaska wilderness. Boggs' seat was declared vacant at the beginning of the 93rd Congress. The deaths of Boggs and Willis came three months after that of longtime Senator Allen J. Ellender, who at the time was President Pro Tempore and chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee. Edwin Edward Willis died the same year that a Louisiana legend became governor: Edwin Washington Edwards, who was Willis' Congressional colleague from Edwards' election to the 7th District seat in October 1965 through the conclusion of the 90th Congress. They were unrelated, despite the similarity of names, but each had supported the other politically over the years. References *\\"Edwin E.

The game was released by Konami in 2006. On September 11, 2018, Larry Hryb announced that Rumble Roses XX would be playable on Xbox One via backwards compatibility Gameplay With the exception of a simple street fighting mode, the bulk of the gameplay focuses on matches which take place in various locales. Matches can be between individual wrestlers, between tag teams of two wrestlers each, or between a wrestler and a team (a more difficult handicap match). Matches are won either through pinning an opponent or forcing the opponent to tap out with a submission move. Players can break free of these through rapid button presses, although as wrestlers suffer more damage (both overall and to specific body parts), this becomes more difficult. The general game mechanics involve striking and grappling with foes to inflict damage upon different body parts. As successful strikes and grapples are performed, players fill a finishing move gauge which can be expended to activate special moves. Attacks can also be countered with the correct timing, resulting in humiliation for the opposing character. When humiliation builds up to a certain level, wrestlers become vulnerable to special \\"H-Moves\\", which have a high probability of inflicting a knockout. Other special moves activated via the filled gauges include \\"Killer Moves\\" and \\"Lethal Moves\\", which differ for each wrestler. Rumble Roses XX supports online Xbox Live gameplay for up to four players, playing as a team or against each other. The online content also allows the player to upload or download images from the game's photo shoot mode. A wide array of character customization options are available from within the Customization Mode. These include various unlockable costumes and swimsuits, as well as adjustable sliders which can be used to increase or decrease body and muscle attributes. The game also includes a Tag Team mode where two players can partake in a tag match. Whenever two specific wrestlers are teamed up, they will have their own special team intro, team name, tag-out sequence, Special Double X move and a special victory pose. There are only three characters in the game that don't have a team partner and those three girls are Yasha, Becky and Evil Rose. The special teams and their names are: *Reiko Hinomoto & Noble Rose: The Kamikaze Typhoon *Candy Cane & Miss Spencer: The Punk & Teacher Alliance (P. T. A.) *Makoto Aihara & Aigle: The Great Beautiful Strong Pair (G. B. S. P.) *Reiko Hinomoto & Dixie Clemets: Tequila Sunrise *Dixie Clemets & Aisha: Rodeo Drive *Anesthesia & Benikage: The Balance Of Terror *Sista A & Mistress: The Vanity Twins *The Black Belt Demon & Great Khan: The Naughty Empire *Sgt. Clemets & Rowdy Reiko: Original Sin *Dr. Anesthesia & Lady X Subsistence: Anesthesia's Experiment Plot Unlike the previous game in the series, Rumble Roses XX does not have a story mode. Development The animations for Rumble Roses XX were created with a mixture of traditional animation and motion-capture. In an interview for Kotaku at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show, producer Akari Uchida said, \\"For this game, we've done a lot of motion capture and rendered individual motions for every character. No two characters will be moving the same way.\\" Uchida also said that \\"we wanted to do a game for the first Xbox\\", but the decision was made to develop for the 360 upon learning of its superior technical abilities. To promote the game, three of its theme songs were made available for karaoke at Joy Sound starting April 10, 2006. Reception Rumble Roses XX received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven for a total of 32 out of 40. Although the game was generally unpopular in North America, it was relatively well received in Japan and rereleased in a Platinum Collection edition. It was the fifth best selling Xbox 360 title in Japan from the console's launch in December 2005 to June 20, 2006. By December 9, 2007, the game had dropped to 18th place in Japanese sales. The character Reiko Hinomoto came in fourth place in a poll that asked 1500 Japanese gamers to name their favorite Xbox 360 heroine.

Biography He was born March 13, 1944 as Warren Tartaglia in Mt. Vernon, New York. His maternal grandfather, Harry Frank, was the first son of a rabbi and his maternal grandmother was Ida Frank. Ida and Harry Frank were the parents of Ruth. Ruth married Warren's father Vincent Tartaglia, and became Ruth Frank Tartaglia. She almost died from post-partum bleeding at his birth and was in the hospital for a month, too sick to care for him, while Warren was in an incubator, for almost a month. Tartaglia graduated from Mt. Vernon's A.B. Davis High School where he was friends with Mike Maggid Bey and other future MOC founders. His friend Mike Maggid was the official photographer for the Noble Order of Moorish Sufis. When he enrolled at N.Y.U. (Washington Square), Tartaglia ran a temple there and became the head of Orissa Province (New York State). His friend G.M. Foster (Ghulam El Fatah) would head Temple #14 in Newark, N.J., and be Governor of Behar Province (New Jersey). Tartaglia was also responsible for the chartering of Noble Order Temples 7, 22, and 23. Later, in 1965, some initiates of those temples would start the Moorish Orthodox Church at NYC's Columbia University.El Fatah, Ghulam \\"Remembering Walid\\", Moorish Science Monitor: Historical Edition (Baltimore: Noble Order of Moorish Sufis, Spring 2000: 53, 55). The Sultan Rafi Sharif Bey, brought him into the Noble Order of Moorish Sufis in Baltimore in 1959 after being introduced by a mutual friend and Noble Order member ‚Äî his cousin's friend Jane Raquel Jacobs (Yacoubi El). Tartaglia was 15 or 16 at this point and learned about Hassan Sabah and the Hashshasheen Ismaili Dervish Order. Like the Bey and Bey's father, Tartaglia was a jazz musician and shared interests in worker rights. Tartaglia was an alto saxophone player, a poet, and an artist. He played with musicians such as Yusuf Lateef, Art Blakey, Jim Green, Freddie Mitchell, and Pony Poindexter. Art Blakey's son and his daughter-in-law would join the Noble Order Moors. Tartaglia would often travel from Mt. Vernon, New York, to Baltimore to visit his mother's relatives (his aunt Ralene Frank Wasserman and her daughter, his cousin Randi) and Bey. Tartaglia became a Noble Order Moor and rose quickly in the ranks of the Noble Order of Moorish Sufis, was given a Moorish name (Walid al-Taha) and title, and the honor of heading the second Noble Order Temple. al-Taha brought the NOMS and the MOC to the larger world as a preacher and a radio talk-show host on WBAI. During his time there in 1965 he also read some of his poems on air and five were published posthumously in the collection Destruction of Baltimore. Al Fowler, Ed Sanders, Ghulam El Fattah (Gregory Foster), Barbara Holland, and Harry Fainlight read their works over the airwaves on his show. His The Hundred Seeds of Beirut was republished by the Chicago based Magribine Press in 2006 with additional previously unpublished works (poetry and letters) written by Warren.

This renal insufficiency is associated with the use of oral sodium phosphate (OSP) such as C.B. Fleet's Phospho soda and Salix's Visocol, for bowel cleansing prior to a colonoscopy. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the potential risk factors of this complication are pre- existing kidney disease, increased age, female gender, dehydration, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,...concurrent treatment with hypertensive medications (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) and medications that affect renal perfusion (Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug or NSAIDs and diuretics). This complication can be diagnosed with renal tests and biomarkers in laboratories including histochemical staining of renal biopsy specimens, the measure of creatinine level, GFR level, and urine output, urine microscopy, CT scanning, and urinalysis. Phosphate nephropathy may also lead to further renal complications including acute kidney diseases and chronic kidney diseases, or the abrupt and gradual loss of kidney function over time. Different management approaches involve the use of alternative bowel preparation agents and increasing patients' risk assessment among healthcare professionals, including nephrologists, gastroenterologists, and renal pathologists. Other agents used for bowel preparation (e.g. magnesium citrate or PEG-3350 & electrolyte-based purgatives such as Colyte or Golytely) do not carry this risk. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \\"acute phosphate nephropathy is a rare, serious adverse event that has been associated with the use of OSPs. The occurrence of these events was previously described in an Information for Healthcare Professionals sheet and an FDA Science Paper issued in May 2006. Additional cases of acute phosphate nephropathy have been reported to FDA and described in the literature since these were issued.\\" TOC Natural history Mannitol and large volume of saline were first used as bowel preparation agents prior to colonoscopy. As the use of Mannitol causes the production of methane, hydrogen, and other flammable gases, it was reported to be associated with colonic explosion. Large volume of saline was also reported to significantly impact the electrolyte balance and net fluid within the body. Later in the 1990, the polyethylene-glycol electrolyte lavage solution or PEG- ELS, was formulated with more effectiveness and safety to use. PEG-ELS was not widely adopted due to its requirement of consuming an enormous volume. Then, OSP (C.B. Fleet's Phospho soda) in the form of tablets with the same efficacy as PEG-ELS, was chosen as a safe alternative bowel preparation agent. Later, in 1975, acute kidney injury and potential chronic kidney disease were first found to be related to the ingestion of OSP. Then, in 2003, an adverse incident of calcium phosphate deposition within the renal tubules was first reported following the use of OSP. This was linked to the tubular injury and other renal complications as well as the emergence of the term ‚Äúphosphate nephropathy‚Äù. Signs and symptoms Patients with phosphate nephropathy have variable outcomes, either being recognised as developing acute kidney injury, the abrupt loss in renal failure, or being undiagnosed. As the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals are detected at the renal tubules following the use of OSP, the symptoms of phosphate nephropathy are similar to acute tubular necrosis, an intrinsic renal injury. For example, events including diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, sepsis, and hypotension following the colonoscopy, can indicate the risk of phosphate nephropathy and raise the concern for acute tubular necrosis. The results of hypotension and dehydration are dry mucous membrane, decreased skin turgor, and cool extremities, which can be used to notify the abnormal renal perfusion. As there is a gap between the first administration of OSP and recognisable symptoms, many phosphate nephropathy incidences are overlooked and not proceeded to biopsy for further investigation. The transient hyperphosphatasemia, the electrolyte disorder with elevated phosphate level in the blood, is found to be correlated with the use of OSP after colonoscopy. Significant electrolyte abnormalities including hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and hypomagnesemia are also the outcomes of the use of OSP. As these detection tests are mostly operated at the laboratory level, phosphate nephropathy incidents are widely under-recognized and overlooked. Depiction of different adverse renal conditions. Phosphate nephropathy or deposition of calcium phosphate within renal tubules belongs to the urinary stone problems. Diagnosis =Pathophysiology= The efficient elimination of phosphorus depends on the kidney‚Äôs filtration rate and the phosphorus bioavailability in the blood. Most renal phosphorus is absorbed at the proximal tubules in comparison to the distal nephron. The elevated phosphorus load, or hyperphosphatemia, can reduce the phosphorus reabsorption in the kidney‚Äôs proximal tubular within minutes of OSP ingestion. This leads to hypovolemia, a large distribution of phosphate at the distal nephron without being completely reabsorbed at the proximal tubules. Hypovolemia results in an increase of proximal salt and water at the descending limb of the loop of Henle, where calcium and phosphate are unable to permeate. Hypovolemia collectively combines with the ongoing water and salt reabsorption in the proximal tubules, enhances the calcium phosphate precipitation within the renal tubular lumen. Parathyroid hormone-induced calcium precipitation also contributes to the formation of calcium phosphate crystals, which thus impairs the renal function. An excess phosphorus triggers calcium precipitation and reduces calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. This reduces the ionized calcium concentration in blood, which further induces a compensatory parathyroid hormone response. Parathyroid hormone is reported to accelerate urinary calcium load, which results in the formation of calcium phosphate crystals in the renal distal tubules and collecting ducts. When the calcium phosphate crystals bind to the tubular epithelial cells, the reactive oxygen species are released, which further impair the renal excretory pathway. The use of OSP causes an increase in phosphatemia and impairs renal perfusion, which later leads to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. The calcification of major arteries like coronary arteries and cardiovascular complication risks can be the result of impaired kidney function in excreting calcium and phosphate. =Types of assessment= Phosphate nephropathy can be diagnosed via different types of assessment, most of which are also used to detect acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Most phosphate nephropathy incidents are diagnosed weeks or months after taking OSP, due to its clinical silence. For example, these assessments include the measurement of serum phosphorus with an elevation of more than 3 mmol/L, the finding of an elevated serum creatinine level and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine microscopy for crystallization detection, the image of calcium phosphate crystals deposited through CT scanning, urinalysis, renal biopsy specimens with histochemical staining for calcium phosphate. These assessments are generally carried out within the laboratory environment, in which longer waiting time is required to attain the results. The measurement of serum creatinine level and GFR are used to indicate the severity stage of acute kidney injury or the duration of impairment of kidney function, when early- onset phosphate nephropathy occurs. The more than 1.5 fold increase in serum creatinine level, or the more than 25% decrease in GFR, or the decrease in urine output less than 0.5mL/kg/h within 6 hours, signify the risk of attaining acute kidney injury after ingestion of OPS. Urine microscopy is reported to be an accurate diagnostic assessment for underlying crystalline- induced nephropathy, either endogenous or drug-induced calcium phosphate crystals. Via examining the urinary sediments, calcium phosphate crystals are identified, and the associated phosphate nephropathy is determined. As phosphate nephropathy results in acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, the impairment in kidney function can be measured via urinalysis. The presence of non-dysmorphic erythrocytes, modest proteinuria or protein within urine, pyuria or pus within urine, and leukocyte cast indicates acute tubular necrosis and acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. For phosphate nephropathy with nonspecific symptoms, renal biopsy is reported as an important diagnosis due to the normal levels of both calcium and phosphorus. Following renal biopsy, the calcium phosphate crystals are distinguished from calcium oxalate crystals via staining with haematoxylin and eosin, as calcium phosphate deposits lack birefringence under polarized light. Then, the positive staining with the von Kossa stains can be used to display the presence of abnormal calcium and phosphate deposits respectively via light illumination. Risk factors According to the FDA, caution is required to consider prior use of OSP, especially in patients with the following potential risk factors. For instance, people older than 55, female gender, people with a history of kidney diseases if their GFR level is less than 60 mL/min, people who recurrently on antihypertensive treatment with NSAIDs, ARBs, ACEIs, and diuretics, people who have lower fluid intake and less bowel movements, people who have underlying systemic and gastrointestinal diseases, and a short interval between OSP administrations (less than 12 hours interval). The risk of acquiring phosphate nephropathy was reported to increase in parallel with the number of these listed risk factors. Older people are particularly at risk when using OSP for colonoscopy, as they have lower fluid intake, have intrinsically less bowel movements, and often have antihypertensive or nephrotoxic drugs. It is also reported that people with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other metabolic syndromes will have a higher risk of phosphate nephropathy. Management =Prevention= As phosphate nephropathy is considered an irreversible complication when starting to progress into acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, prevention strategies can help to avoid the undesired outcomes. According to the FDA, it is recommended for both healthcare professionals and patients, particularly high-risk individuals, to obtain adequate information about the adverse effect of OSP before administering and consuming this agent. Monitoring of renal function weeks or months after the administration of OSP also helps to early detect and treat the condition appropriately. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy. As ingestion of OPS can potentially induce osmotic diarrhea and result in depletion of body fluid, adequate hydration is recommended before and after the procedure to prevent episodes of hypotension. It is unknown whether water or electrolyte-containing solutions would adequately compensate the electrolyte imbalance following the use of OSP. The recommended volume of fluid when using OSP as a bowel preparation agent varies from 0.7 to 2.2 L, with the optimal amount greater than 3.7 L. It is still unknown whether lowering the standard doses of OSP from 45/45 ml to 45/30 mL in 9‚Äì12 hours apart would be safer to use, as lower OSP dose was reported to cause moderate elevation of serum phosphorus. In addition, there are other relevant bowel- preparation agents that can be used in line with the colonoscopy guidelines including electrolyte-based purgatives such as Golytely, Polyethylene glycol (PEG), sodium picosulfate, and sodium laxatives. These bowel preparation alternatives show the same efficacy with OSP and cause less frequently and significantly side effects and complications than OSP. =Treatment= Upon the early detection, phosphate nephropathy can be treated with a timely renal replacement therapy such as haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in order to decelerate the calcium phosphate crystallization process. Haemodialysis is performed to assist the renal excretion via removing accumulated toxins, especially the overproduction of reactive oxygen species at the damaged tubular epithelial cells. The complete recovery of renal function after phosphate nephropathy progression to acute kidney injury or to chronic kidney disease, was reported to be rare.

It runs for in eastern Iowa. It begins at the Mississippi River in Clinton on the Mark Morris Memorial Bridge, where it continues as Illinois Route 136. It ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 52 and Iowa Highway 3 in Luxemburg. Although signed as a north-south highway throughout, the highway runs east to west between Clinton and Oxford Junction, while turning north at Oxford Junction to complete its run to Luxemburg. For most of its existence, Iowa 136 has connected Clinton and Luxemburg. During the 1950s-1960s, the northern and southern ends of the route shifted slightly because nearby United States highways changed their alignments. Route description Iowa Highway 136 begins on the Mark Morris Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River at Clinton. It descends the approach to the bridge and intersects U.S. Route 67 (US 67), which is running along N. Second Street. It turns to the north, overlapping US 67 for until US 67 splits away at N. Third Street. From US 67, Iowa 136 goes west along Main Avenue and leaves town enters rural Clinton County. It heads to the north-northwest for towards Goose Lake along a narrow, curving stretch of road. Conditions along this part of Iowa 136 have led some residents to create a page on the social networking website Facebook dedicated to calling attention to the road. From Goose Lake, Iowa 136 continues to the west towards Delmar for , passing through Charlotte along the way. Three miles (4.8 km) west of Delmar, it meets U.S. Route 61 at a diamond interchange. This interchange is adjacent to the 61 Drive In outdoor movie theatre. It continues west through the small communities of Elwood and Lost Nation, before reaching Oxford Junction. At Oxford Junction, Iowa 136 turns to the north and travels to Wyoming, where it meets Iowa Highway 64. For one mile (1.6 km), Iowa 64 and Iowa 136 overlap each other through Wyoming. On the western edge of the community, Iowa 136 splits away and travels north towards Onslow. North of Onslow, it passes through rural Jones County for , crossing the Maquoketa River, before reaching Cascade and U.S. Route 151. Now in Dubuque County, Iowa 136 crosses the North Fork Maquoketa River and heads northwest towards Worthington. Five miles () later, it meets U.S. Route 20 at a partial cloverleaf interchange south of Dyersville. North of Dyersville, it travels north, through New Vienna, and to the northeast towards Luxemburg. At Luxemburg, Iowa 136 enters town along Andre Street. The route ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 52 and Iowa Highway 3. Northbound US 52 continues north along Andre Street, while southbound US 52 and both directions of Iowa 3 follow Main Street. History In 1926, when Primary Road No. 20 (PR 20) was renamed U.S. Route 61, Primary Road No. 61, which connected Clinton to US 61 west of Delmar, was renumbered Primary Road No. 136. In 1930, Iowa Iowa 136 had been extended west and north to what is now Iowa 64, replacing Iowa 153. Iowa 136 extended north to Onslow in 1931, and to Cascade in 1935. In 1938, Iowa 136 had been extended to Luxemburg, replacing Iowa 188. By 1947, only the PR 61 section of road and another section between Wyoming and Oxford Junction had been paved. In Clinton, Iowa 136 originally began at the N. Third Street intersection with U.S. Route 67. After U.S. Route 30 was rerouted over the Gateway Bridge in 1955, Iowa 136 was extended to cross the Mississippi River over the Lyons-Fulton Bridge. A year later, an Alternate U.S. Route 30 was designated over the old alignment of US 30 through Clinton, and Iowa 136 was pulled back to its old end. In 1967, the Alternate US 30 designation was dropped and Iowa 136 again crossed the river. From 1963 to 1967, U.S. Route 52 was realigned from Dubuque to Luxemburg to follow U.S. Route 20 to Dyersville and Iowa 136 to Luxemburg while its original alignment was rebuilt. During this time, Iowa 136 was truncated back to US 20 at Dyersville, but it was redesignated along this segment after US 52 returned to its old alignment.

He was tried at the high court in Aberdeen from 23‚Äì25 July 1963 for the murder of merchant seaman Thomas Guyan. His execution, at HM Prison, Craiginches, Aberdeen, was performed by hangman Harry Allen.  Background  On 2 February 1957, Thomas Guyan married Margaret May, and a year later they moved into a first floor flat at 14 Jackson Terrace, Aberdeen, a house owned by May's grandmother Annie Henderson. A son was born in September 1958, followed by a second in February 1961; however, the father of this second child was not Thomas. This led to marital problems which came to a head in 1962 when Margaret consulted a solicitor about the possibility of a divorce which her husband refused. Then, in December of that same year she went to work at John R. Stephen Fish Curers where she met a new admirer, Henry Burnett. A relationship soon developed and, by May 1963, Margaret had moved out of Jackson Terrace with her younger son Keith to share a new address in Skene Terrace with Burnett.  Events of 31 May 1963  Henry Burnett came to believe that, given the chance, Margaret would leave him, so he took to locking her in the house whenever he went out. This was not a state of affairs which Margaret relished so when by chance she met her estranged husband on 31 May, she agreed to go back to him. Margaret Guyan arrived at 40 Skene Terrace at 4.00 pm, to collect her son Keith. A family friend, Georgina Cattanagh, went with her for moral support. As soon as Margaret announced her intention to go back to her husband, Burnett cried \\"Margaret, Margaret, you are not going to leave me!\\" He then drew a knife to Margaret's throat, closing the door behind them. Fearful of what was happening inside, Cattanagh banged repeatedly on the front door and demanded the release of Margaret. Minutes later, Burnett threw open the door and ran off down the street. Margaret was shaken, but relatively unhurt. The two women made their way back to 14 Jackson Terrace. Burnett went to his brother Frank's workplace and told him what had happened; his brother urged him to go to the police. But Burnett, still set on revenge, instead went to Frank's house in the city's Bridge of Don area to borrow his brother's shotgun. Because Frank's wife had been told never to lend the gun to anyone, Burnett forced the cabinet open and stole the gun, along with some cartridges, after which he boarded a bus to 14 Jackson Terrace. He arrived at the Guyans' flat and forced his way in. After Cattanagh screamed \\"You can't come in here!\\", Thomas Guyan jumped to his feet to see what the problem was. As he opened the kitchen door, he was met by Burnett, carrying the gun. A shot rang out and Guyan fell dead, having been shot in the face at close range. Burnett then took Margaret out of the flat at gun point; on the way down the stairs, he threatened a young boy from a neighbouring flat. Burnett dragged Margaret down a lane and as far as a garage on Seaforth Road, near the main route north out of Aberdeen. John Innes Irvine was filling his car with petrol at the garage when Burnett demanded his car. Irvine tried to stop Burnett from stealing the car, but was threatened with the shotgun. The police were soon notified of the theft and began following the car, which was driving north towards Peterhead. After driving for about 15 miles, Burnett pulled the car over near the town of Ellon and offered no resistance as he was arrested by Constable James G. Raeper and Constable Mitchell.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23685786  Trial  At his trial, Burnett's defence was that at the time of the crime he was insane or alternatively, that this was a case of diminished responsibility. Both defences failed after the jury had considered the evidence for 25 minutes. The court had heard expert witness evidence from three psychiatrists: A. M. Wylie, the Physician Superintendent of the Royal Cornhill Hospital, Professor Miller and Ian M Lowit, Consultant Child Psychiatrist, all of whom agreed that Burnett should be reprieved on psychiatric grounds. In letters later sent to the Scotsman newspaper, Professor Miller and Dr Lowit explained that their evidence suggested that Burnett displayed what Miller described as psychopathic tendencies, for which he had received treatment in hospital in the past.Dr Lowit's letters and papers, housed in the Aberdeen City Council Public Archive It was revealed in Court that he had been violent in the past and had also attempted suicide. In correspondence with The Scotsman and the Howard League for Penal Reform, it appears that the expert psychiatric evidence was mocked by the press and discounted by the Crown. The argument for Capital Punishment hinged upon the use of a firearm: Murder by firearm was a Capital Offence, to deter criminals from deeds like armed robbery, but the expert witnesses indicated that Burnett's use of the weapon better fitted an impulsive crime of passion than a crime motivated by intentions that Capital Punishment was supposed to deter. His mother and father both appeared in the witness box and his mother broke down in the court. After he was sentenced to death, both his own family and that of the victim petitioned for his reprieve. However, there was no appeal from Burnett and at 8.00 am on Thursday, 15 August 1963, the 21-year-old was executed on Britain's newest gallows (built in 1962 to Home Office-approved specifications) as a crowd of 200 people gathered outside the prison. Executioner Harry Allen and his assistant Samuel Plant performed the hanging. Shortly afterwards, Burnett's body was buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of the prison, as was customary.http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/body-of-last-scot-hanged- for-murder-may-be- exhumed-1-3001642http://www.britishexecutions.co.uk/execution- content.php?key=905 Craiginches Prison closed permanently in January 2014 and the grounds were ear-marked for redevelopment.

Before conceiving his son, an explosion breached the facility's nuclear reactor, bombarding Frederic and a cleaning woman with radiation. When Jerome was born a year later, he possessed black skin (despite both of his parents being Caucasian) and tufts of body hair. Jerome was despised by his family because of his freakish appearance, and when he was ten his father drove him out into the New Mexico desert and abandoned him. While wandering the desert, Jerome encountered Nekra Sinclair, the daughter of the cleaning woman who had been bombarded by radiation in the same accident that had affected Beecham's father. Although her parents were black, she had been born albino white and had developed vampiric features. For six years they lived by theft and scavenging until they were attacked by a lynch mob that thought they were monsters. The hatred triggered by the attack manifested Beecham's ability to control women with his pheromones, as well as Sinclair's powers, which the two used to kill some of their attackers and escape the rest. Now possessing a more monkey-like appearance, Beecham became a professional criminal and took the name Mandrill. Traveling to Africa, the two plotted to overthrow and seize control of three small nations through a cult of personality powered by the Mandrill's pheromone ability. They intended to create a society free of the values that had led them to be rejected when they were young. This effort was thwarted by Shanna the She-Devil.

The first version of the Coat of Arms of Peru was designed by General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and officially declared on 21 October 1820. It consisted of a landscape of Inti the sun rising from the Andes, seen from the sea, and escorted by laurel branches tied with a golden ribbon. In the shield, on a blue sky background, the sun's yellow rays can be seen behind the dark brown mountains rising above the blue and green ocean. The flags of the South American nations and a banana tree can be seen behind the shield. A condor on the left and a llama on the right act as supporters. This was on top of a baroque base, with a scroll under it with the motto \\"Renaci√≥ el sol del Per√∫\\" (\\"Peru's sun is reborn\\") in capital letters. Some flowers, branches and ammunition were on the base. =Second version= Coat of Arms in 1825 Third Coat of Arms since 1825 until 1950. On 25 February 1825, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and the Constituent Congress proclaimed a law defining the new national symbols. establishing the new Coat of Arms, similar to the one used today. This was designed by Congressmen Jos√© Gregorio Paredes and Francisco Javier Cort√©s. The official description was the following: :\\"Las armas de la Naci√≥n Peruana constar√°n de un escudo dividido en tres campos (forma polaca), uno azul celeste, a la derecha, que llevar√° una vicu√±a mirando al interior; otro blanco, a la izquierda, donde se colocar√° el √°rbol de la quina; y otro rojo inferior y m√°s peque√±o en que se ver√° una cornucopia derramando monedas, signific√°ndose con estos s√≠mbolos, las preciosidades del Per√∫ en los tres reinos naturales. El escudo tendr√° por timbre una corona c√≠vica vista de plano; e ir√° acompa√±ada en cada lado de una bandera y un estandarte de los colores nacionales, se√±alado m√°s adelante.\\" :\\"The arms of the Peruvian Nation shall consist of a shield divided into three fields (Polish shape), one light-blue, to the left, which will carry a vicu√±a looking inwards; another white, on the right, where a cinchona tree will be located; and another red below and smaller in which a cornucopia will be seen spilling coins, signifying with these symbols, the richnesses of Peru in the three natural kingdoms. The shield shall have as crest a Civic Crown seen flat; and shall be escorted on each side by a flag and standard of the same national colors, described later.\\" 1950 modification This is the coat of arms used today and is a modification of the second version. Until 1950, the coat of arms was a symbol of both the nation and the state, and presented some difficulties in its design. These generated that, months after its creation, that the seals of ministries modified the law, cutting the width of the shield to design the cornucopia comfortably, and getting rid of the escorting flags. The last modification was in March 1950, during General Manuel A. Odr√≠a‚Äôs administration. In this way, the coat of arms was split in halves, and the lower section became the largest, rather than the smallest. The national coat of arms was created simultaneously as a heraldic symbol of the State.

Shortly after the 1963‚Äì64 campaign, Ohl was involved one of the first so-called megatrades, this one an eight-player deal between the Pistons and Bullets. On June 9, 1964, the Pistons sent Ohl, center Bob Ferry, forward Bailey Howell, forward Les Hunter and the draft rights to guard Wally (later Wali) Jones to the Bullets in exchange for forwards Terry Dischinger and Don Kojis and guard Rod Thorn. The deal turned out to a fortuitous one for the Bullets, as Howell and Ohl became mainstays with the team. Ohl experienced his finest hour in the 1965 playoffs, which saw the Bullets eliminate the St. Louis Hawks in four games in round one. In the Western Division finals, Ohl and future Hall of Fame guard Jerry West were locked in a tense shootout that saw West and the Los Angeles Lakers finally prevail in six games, each of which was decided by eights points or fewer.

The small port located on the Great Australian Bight in the Limestone Coast region about southeast of Adelaide and south of Mount Gambier in the District Council of Grant local government area. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that the locality of Port MacDonnell had a population of 847 of which 671 lived in its town centre. Once a busy shipping port, the town now relies heavily on its fishing and summer tourism industries, particularly rock lobster harvest industry, proclaiming itself \\"Australia's Southern Rock Lobster Capital\\".http://portmacdonnell.sa.au/  History  The area was originally inhabited by the Bungandidj Aborigines, who referred to it as Ngaranga, possibly meaning \\"noisy\\" or \\"caves\\". Their oral history recorded that the dry land previously extended southwards from this area, before it was flooded. The first Europeans to see the area were led by explorer Lieutenant James Grant in on 3 December 1800. In 1860 the area was proclaimed an official port, was given a name, and was surveyed. It is named after Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell who was Governor of South Australia from 1855 to 1862. In the 1880s, it was one of Australia's busiest ports, shipping large quantities of wheat and wool to Europe. The port was, however, exposed to the weather and the site of many shipwrecks. Across the border in Portland, Victoria, 85 km southeast, is a much more sheltered port. The following have been listed as state heritage places on the South Australian Heritage Register ‚Äì the Cape Northumberland Lighthouse, the Dingley Dell Museum and the Former Port MacDonnell customs house.  Geography  The town of Port MacDonnell is set on flat swampy land in a bay between rocky capes of spectacular wave eroded formations the most spectacular being those to the near west at Cape Northumberland. The port's harbour itself is formed by a large artificially constructed rock breakwater, while the coastline is sandy beaches and rock outcrops providing shelter to the port from the rough seas. The rock provides substantial habitat for the southern rock lobster which is the town's main industry and colonies of little penguin.  Lighthouse  Cape Northumberland has a prominent lighthouse which dates to 1882. An earlier 1858 lighthouse was the first in South Australia however was demolished after it was in danger of collapse. A monument marks the site.http://www.lighthouse.net.au/lights/sa/Cape%20Northumberland/Cape%20Northumberland.htm#History  Governance  Port MacDonnell is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of Mount Gambier and the local government area of the District Council of Grant.

The poem was a reading of the autopsy report issued by the St. Louis County Coroner's Office on the shooting of Michael Brown, an African-American teenager who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014, setting off local protests that spread to many cities nationwide. Goldsmith explained his process on Facebook: \\"I altered the text for poetic effect; I translated into plain English many obscure medical terms that would have stopped the flow of the text; I narrativized it in ways that made the text less didactic and more literary.\\" The reading was met with controversy.Alec Wilkinson. Something Borrowed: Kenneth Goldsmith's poetry elevates copying to an art, but did he go too far? The New Yorker, October 5, 2015 Brown University professor John Cayley stated that the video recording of the poem will not be released to the public, as requested by the poet. Goldsmith said that he is, \\"requesting that Brown University not make public the recording of my performance of 'The Body of Michael Brown'. There's been too much pain for many people around this and I do not wish to cause any more.\\" Personal life He lives in New York City with his wife, artist Cheryl Donegan, and his two sons.

She was named after Tiffany & Company; her father purchased the air rights above the Fifth Avenue jewelry store in the 1980s while building Trump Tower next door. Her parents divorced in 1999 after being separated for two years. She was raised by her mother in California. She has three older half-siblings, Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric, from Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana, and a younger half-brother, Barron, from Trump's third wife, Melania. For high school, she attended Viewpoint School in Calabasas, California, where she graduated in 2012. She then went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, her father's alma mater, where she graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology with a concentration in law and society, and was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.

The series ran for 23 episodes from February to August 2006 on the WOWOW satellite network. It is set in a future where humans and AutoReiv androids coexist peacefully until a virus gives the robots self-awareness, causing them to commit a series of murders. Inspector Re-L Mayer is assigned to investigate, discovering there is a more complicated plot behind it that involves a humanoid species known as \\"Proxy\\" who are the subject of secret government experiments. The series, which is heavily influenced by philosophy and Gnosticism, features a combination of 2D digital cel animation, 3D computer modeling, and digital special effects. After its release in Japan, the anime was licensed for a DVD release by Geneon Entertainment, with a subsequent television broadcast on Fuse in the United States. The show was also distributed to Australian, British and Canadian anime markets. Since its release, Ergo Proxy has received mostly favorable reviews which praised its visuals and themes. Plot =Story= The story begins in a futuristic domed city called Romdeau, built to protect its citizens after a global ecological disaster thousands of years prior. In this utopia, humans, and androids known as AutoReivs coexist peacefully under a total management system. A series of murders committed by robots and AutoReivs infected with the Cogito virus (which causes them to become self-aware) begins to threaten the delicate balance of Romdeau's social order. Behind the scenes, the government has been conducting secret experiments on a mysterious humanoid life form called a \\"Proxy\\"; the Proxy beings (described as almighty, god-like, immortal, omnipotent) are believed to hold the very key to the survival of humanity. Re-l (pronounced or \\"Ree-EL\\"; also represented by the spelling \\"R.E.A.L.\\" in the Romdeau citizen database) Mayer is assigned to investigate some of the murders with her AutoReiv partner, Iggy. She encounters two unknown and highly powerful creatures. She later learns that a Proxy was involved. The other central character, an immigrant named Vincent Law, is revealed to be connected in some ways with this Proxy. After being hunted down, Vincent lives in a commune on the outside of the dome for a while. During the massacre of the commune by Raul Creed of the Security Bureau, Vincent leaves the area for Mosk, his birthplace, in an attempt to recover his memories. Re-l later rejoins him to try to discover the truth behind the Proxies and the domes. It is revealed among other things that domes are all created by Proxies as well as the people inhabiting them who are created in special incubators. =Setting= In the Romdeau arcology, the government is divided between several entities: the Intelligence Bureau, the Health & Welfare Bureau, and the Security Bureau, are named in the series, all under the control of an Administrator who is referred to as the \\"Regent\\" and grandfather of \\"R.E.A.L.\\" The primary AutoReiv types are referred to as either \\"Companion\\" or \\"Entourage\\", depending on their role. There are others designed for leisure or combat functions; AutoReivs seem to be constructed of varying degrees of cybernetic complexity, as witnessed by AutoReivs on occasion producing blood splatter when shot and killed. The humans in the city are grown in artificial wombs but are still biologically related to their ancestors. Numerous times throughout the series it is stated that the humans living in the domes have no capacity to reproduce naturally, or at least that's what they have been told. Likewise, when a new person is grown, they are done so to fulfill a specific purpose, thus ensuring that person's future- place in society through a \\"raison d'√™tre\\".  Production  Ergo Proxy was directed by Sh≈´k≈ç Murase with Dai Sat≈ç serving as chief writer and Naoyuki Onda as character designer. The anime was originally announced at the MIP TV Trade Show in France as a 23-episode TV series. Manglobe initially approached Sh≈´k≈ç Murase with a bare-bones vision for a futuristic detective thriller, which included the title, a plot outline for episodes 1-3 and a design concept for Romdeau. Beyond that they let him develop the idea towards a more existentialist slant. > \\"There was almost too much freedom\\", he laughs. \\"A show slated to be on a > commercial network carries restrictions according to the time slot\\", he > explains. \\"Sponsors often have requests intended to help propel the work to > hit status; and merchandising entails another set of requirements > altogether. By comparison, all Ergo Proxy had to deal with was a DVD release > and a TV broadcast over a pay satellite channel.\\" When asked about how he devised the title Ergo Proxy, Sat≈ç simply replied \\"[I]t sounds cool\\". Murase explained he originally wanted to use the concept of everyone having another self inside of themselves: the idea that there are two personalities inside a person and noted that Ren√© Descartes' phrase \\"cogito, ergo sum\\" was the inspiration for it. Sat≈ç stated that they originally did not want to explicitly express the concepts of Gnosticism in the anime. However, their personal beliefs ended up reflecting the ideas of Gnosticism and realized how well these terms fit and decided to use them. At first they intended to have Vincent as the leading protagonist and Re-l as a supporting character; however, as they fleshed out her character, she became a much stronger character and began to steal the spotlight from Vincent. This gave them the opportunity to split the narrative between the two characters instead of having a single protagonist lead the story. Media =Anime= In Japan, Ergo Proxy aired on pay-TV satellite broadcasting network WOWOW from 25 February 2006, concluding on August 12, 2006. Ergo Proxy was then released by Geneon Entertainment onto nine DVD volumes from May 25, 2006 to January 25, 2007. The series was licensed by Geneon Entertainment for Region 1 release, which began on November 21, 2006 and spanned six volumes.

In Canada, the English dub aired on pay-TV digital channel G4techTV's Anime Current programming block from July 26, 2007 to December 27, 2007. =Manga= A manga spin-off called was written by Manglobe and illustrated by Yumiko Harao. The manga was serialized in Shogakukan's Monthly Sunday Gene-X from its March 2006 issue to the December 2006 issue. It was later released in two tank≈çbon format, the first in August 18, 2006, and the second on February 19, 2007. =Soundtracks= Two soundtracks of the anime series, titled Ergo Proxy OST opus01 and Ergo Proxy OST opus02, have been released by Geneon Entertainment in Japan on May 25, 2006 and August 25, 2006 respectively. Both soundtracks feature compositions of Yoshihiro Ike. The first soundtrack, opus01, contains several tracks including the opening and ending themes: \\"Kiri\\" (by Monoral) and \\"Paranoid Android\\" (by Radiohead). The second soundtrack, opus02, was initially packaged with a special edition of the first Region 1 DVD. Reception Ergo Proxy received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the series for its intricate visuals, cyberpunk aesthetic and intellectual themes; while criticizing the uneven narrative and its over reliance on philosophical references. Newtype USA stated that they were \\"excited by the premise of the show, which features complex drama surrounding the strikingly beautiful crime investigator Re-l Mayer, and an intricate sci- fi setting, incorporating robots, living in human society and a grotesque array of unique monsters\\". Newtype went on to praise the \\"tremendous supporting cast and carefully woven plot\\". Newtype USA featured the first Ergo Proxy DVD in their \\"DVD of the Month\\", describing it as a \\"show that rewards viewers with a deep, believable, and above all thoughtful sci-fi story instead of simply bashing robots together\\". Katherine Luther of About.com praised it for its cyberpunk themes and mix of 2D and 3D animation as well as its deep psychological storyline, calling it creepy, intense and \\"edge-of-your-seat- delightful\\". THEM Anime Reviews praised the visuals and pacing of the plot while noting that the greatest flaw in the series is that the designs can be inconsistent at times. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network gave it an overall score of B+ and criticized the characters, stating \\"It's an unfortunate stain on an otherwise excellent series.\\" However, he praised the animation stating \\"The backgrounds in particular are breathtakingly detailed and beautiful, which is a surprise given the bleak, dystopian surroundings\\" Carlo Santos, also from Anime News Network, criticized the middle and ending of the anime, stating \\"Some of the middle episodes fall back on experimental gimmicks and fail to advance the story, while the finale becomes a towering mess as it desperately tries to resolve every single plot point. Even the animation has embarrassing moments of inconsistency.\\" However, Santos continued to state \\"for trying so hard to scale the heights of a difficult genre, Ergo Proxy still deserves credit. It accomplishes more than most other anime series ever hope to, flaws and all.\\" IGN contributor D. F. Smith reviewed the series DVD box set in 2008, giving the series a 7.0 out of a possible score of 10. Smith overall found the visuals, music and voice acting of Ergo Proxy to be exceptional, but stated that the overall story was too complex and relied too heavily on philosophical references rather than a strong narrative. In conclusion, D. F. Smith wrote \\"Ergo Proxy isn't without its share of disappointments, but even so, it has a heck of a lot going for it. What it lacks in the way of a truly gripping, involving story, it makes up for in part with a powerful soundtrack, some powerful visuals, and the occasional powerful insight. If those are the sort of things you go to Japanese animation looking for, you might not find this series disappointing at all\\". Another IGN columnist, Ramsley Isler, placed Ergo Proxys opening as the 10th greatest anime opening. Isler praised the opening's use of dark visuals juxtaposed with the opening theme song's optimistic tone, comparing it to a Nine Inch Nails or Lifehouse music video. =China ban= On June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed Ergo Proxy among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.

The three-volley salute is a ceremonial act performed at military funerals and sometimes also police funerals. The custom originates from the European dynastic wars, in which the fighting ceased so that the dead and wounded could be removed. After this was accomplished, three shots were fired into the air to signal that the battle could resume.Gun Salutes - US Dept. of Veterans Affairs It should not be confused with the 21-gun salute (or 19-gun or 17-gun, etc.) which is fired by a battery of artillery pieces. United States In the United States it is part of the drill and ceremony of the Honor Guard. It consists of a rifle party firing blank cartridges into the air three times. A rifle party usually has an odd number of members, from three to seven. The firearm used is typically a rifle, but at some police funerals, shotguns or handguns are used. The party usually stands so that the muzzles are pointed over the casket. However, if mourners are present near the grave, the party stands some distance away (often recommended at least 50 feet) so as to not deafen the attendees and to minimize the disturbance. If the service is being performed indoors, the firing party stands outside the building, often near the front entrance.Marine Corps Drill Manual - Chapter 19 and 21 On the command of the NCO-in-charge, the party raises their weapons and fires three times in unison. Modern United States military parties use M1, M14 or M16 rifles. The use of blank cartridges means these weapon's semi-automatic gas action will not function, requiring manual cycling of the next round between shots. Some parties equip the rifle with a blank-firing adapter, which eliminates this step from the drill after the first shot, though this is seen by some as less traditional. Similarly, the M1 and M14 are generally preferred over the current issue M16 because the appearance of these older rifles is more traditional and the charging handles are more easily operated in a dignified, ceremonial manner. United Kingdom and Commonwealth A similar ceremony is used by the armed forces of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.

It is owned by Immaculate Heart Media, Inc. and airs a Spanish language Catholic format. The station has a colorful history as a Top 40 station KWK. KXFN employs separate daytime and nighttime transmitter sites; the daytime transmitter is located on Chouteau Island near Granite City, Illinois, while the nighttime site is located further south near Dupo, Illinois. Listeners in St. Louis and its adjacent communities can also hear KXFN programming on an FM translator station, 105.3 K287BY. History The station is among the oldest in St. Louis. It began broadcasting in 1925, as KFVE, licensed to the Film Corporation of America in St. Louis.\\"New Stations: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, May 1, 1925, page 4. In November 1927 it changed its call sign to KWK.\\"Alterations and Corrections: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 30, 1927, page 8. At first, KWK was an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network. KWK was owned by Thomas Patrick and had its offices and studios in The Chase Park Plaza Hotel. Later, it was the Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate in St. Louis until August 1969, when the station switched from adult standards to an R&B; format. KWK's claim to national fame was a film clip where a disc jockey at the station is seen smashing one of Elvis Presley's records and declaring \\"Rock and roll has got to go!\\" It was a clear sign that KWK had veered away from the rock format. This clip can be seen in the 1981 film \\"This Is Elvis.\\" On July 31, 1973, the station went off the air until November 1, 1978, when it returned as a Top 40 station, and in March 1979, it began simulcasting with its sister station WWWK-FM. In June 1984, KWK became KGLD, an oldies station. The call letters stood for \\"Gold.\\" On January 1, 1992, KGLD changed to all-sports radio KASP. The station went back to simulcasting with WKBQ-FM in 1993. (WKBQ-FM, then at 106.5 FM, would swap frequencies with WKKX (104.1) in January 1994.) In December 1994, the station flipped to hot talk as \\"Straight Talk 1380.\\" Programming on \\"Straight Talk\\" included Steve & DC in mornings (simulcast with WKBQ-FM), The Fabulous Sports Babe, Ken Hamblin, Tom Leykis and Jim Bohannon. On February 22, 1995, the station changed call letters to KRAM, shortly after the Los Angeles Rams football team announced that they would relocate to St. Louis. On March 21, 1996, 1380 AM returned to simulcasting WKBQ-FM, switching its call sign to WKBQ. That November, Emmis Communications bought it in a deal with WKBQ-FM and WKKX. Emmis would donate the station to a ministry, which changed the call letters to KKWK on February 16, 1998, and flipped the station to a short lived urban talk format.KSLG's logo as \\"Team 1380\\" KKWK switched to a jazz format with new KZJZ call letters adopted on September 1, 1998. KZJZ played mostly classic jazz, had a full-time air staff, and won a Marconi Award. Having low advertising revenues, the station switched to a satellite-run Southern Gospel format as KSLG in November 1999. KSLG switched back to sports in 2004, initially carrying Sporting News Radio programming, and later switched to ESPN Radio. On December 3, 2007, KSLG switched affiliations from ESPN to Fox Sports Radio and rebranded as \\"Team 1380\\". On July 1, 2010, \\"Grand Slam Sports\\", owner of fellow St. Louis sports station KFNS, announced its intention to purchase KSLG pending FCC approval. It began managing the station immediately under a local marketing agreement. This resulted in the return of the syndicated \\"Jim Rome Show\\" to the St. Louis market after an absence of approximately a year.Grand Slam Sports plans to buy 1380 AM KSLG, St. Louis Business Journal, July 1, 2010, Retrieved 2010-07-01 On June 20, 2012, KSLG changed its call letters to KXFN with the FN referring to \\"Fan,\\" similar to now co-owned KFNS. Citing increased competition and declining ratings, KXFN changed its format in May 2013 to a female-oriented talk format, branded as \\"1380 The Woman.\\" Concurrently, KFNS switched to a male-focused hot talk/comedy format as \\"590 The Man\\". The dual-format experiment was a failure for both stations. Less than ten months later, KXFN dropped its talk format to carry Yahoo! Sports Radio. On April 1, 2014, it assumed much of KFNS's hot talk format and airstaff as \\"1380 The X, Xtreme Talk Radio.\\" KFNS itself reverted to sports, but retained the \\"Man\\" nickname. For several months, KFNS and KXFN staffers were publicly critical of station management. There was on- air sparring between hosts, and even a physical altercation between KFNS's morning host and the station manager (who subsequently resigned). On October 1, 2014, KXFN changed to a music/talk format with multiple styles of shows, offering music of different genres as well as comedy talk content. That lasted until the following March, when TalkSTL.com began leasing the airtime on KXFN, once again restoring the previous sports talk format. By that December, TalkSTL.com's parent company, Markel Radio Group, bought and began programming KFNS, which had fallen silent the previous November after \\"Grand Slam Sports\\" went into bankruptcy. Markel would then relaunch a new version of \\"590 The Fan\\", moving some of the staff and programming over from KXFN. After a brief simulcast on both stations, KXFN fell silent on December 19, 2015.The Pulse's logo On August 1, 2016, the Salem Media Group announced the $190,000 purchase of KXFN through \\"Grand Slam Sports\\" bankruptcy receiver Detalus Consulting, pairing it with the recently purchased and relaunched WSDZ. Salem was able to secure FM translators for KXFN and WSDZ as part of the FCC's AM Revitalization Translator Waiver Period. On January 6, 2017, KXFN returned to the air and launched a health and wellness talk format, branded as \\"1380 The Pulse\\".Salem Launches Health Wellness 1380 The Pulse St. Louis Radioinsight - January 6, 2017 The health talk format would last less than a year.

Baker sings two songs, \\"Dream Ship\\" and \\"Neath the Tropical Blue Skies\\", in the film, and dances a number of times.  Plot  Frustrated writer Max de Mirecourt (Albert Pr√©jean) goes to Tunisia in search of inspiration for his next novel. While there, Max lives in a villa with his servant Dar (Georges Peclet) and ghostwriter Coton (Robert Arnoux). Despite Coton's help, Max is unable to come up with any good story ideas. However, he soon meets a local girl named Alwina (Josephine Baker) whose personality intrigues him so greatly that he invents a character based on her for his newest (and 'most exciting') novel. His relation with Alwina serves a dual purpose in that it also angers (or at least highly annoys) his wife Lucie (Germaine Aussey) who has been flirting with the Maharaja of Datane (Jean Galland) back in Paris. Max takes Alwina under his wing and teaches her the manners and social graces of a high-society princess. He then whisks her away to Paris and presents her as Princess Tam Tam from faraway Africa. Lucie is further enraged by all the attention that Alwina receives, and after a friend sees Alwina dance provocatively in the sailors' bar, Lucie calls upon her Maharaja to craft a plan which will destroy her husband's relation with \\"the princess.\\" The Maharaja throws a grand party, inviting the upper crust of Parisian society. Alwina is unable to resist the exotic music, and promptly joins the large, staged dance number, embarrassing Max ‚Äì until he realizes that the entire audience is on their feet, applauding Alwina. Lucie is furious. Lucie and Max forgive each other in the end and fall in love again, Alwina returns to Tunisia after the frustrating realization that, as the Maharaja puts it, \\"Some windows face to the West, and the others to the East.\\" Ultimately, however, the entire European affair is revealed to be little more than an enactment of Max's novel-in-progress. Alwina never does go to Europe, and the primary events of the film are simply a staging of how Max has imagined them. Alwina is given Max's Tunisian estate, and Max's new novel is a success. The title of his new work is \\"Civilisation.\\" When asked about Alwina while back in Europe, Max states that she is \\"better where she is.\\" The film closes with a scene of Alwina and Dar back in Tunisia with their newborn child, with farm animals strewn about Max's mansion. In the final shot, a donkey eats the title page of \\"Civilisation\\" off Max's (now Alwina's) floor.

It was released for free online in 2005 for Microsoft Windows. It was the senior game project of students attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. The gameplay consists of navigating a dungeon using an innovative portal system. The player controls two interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve. The developers went on to write the critically acclaimed Portal using many of the same concepts. The word Narbacular, which does not exist in any dictionary, was chosen primarily to aid in internet search engine results.PC Zone #187, Dec 2007 Plot The plot involves the plight of a Princess \\"No-Knees\\", so named because she is unable to jump. Captured by a demon, the imprisoned princess discovers that the dungeon she is held in is actually a sentient elemental creature named Wally. Using Wally's portal-making ability, the princess sets out to escape and defeat the demon. Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay from the first playable build of the game While Narbacular Drop features a 3D world reminiscent of such first-person shooters as Quake, the unique portal element and the character's lack of a jump ability makes navigation and puzzle-solving very unconventional. The player can open a single pair of interconnected portals at a time, each styled as a huge face with flaming eyes (orange or blue to tell them apart as the player repositions one or the other) and an open mouth big enough to see and walk through. Positioned with a point-and-click interface controlled by the mouse, portals are allowed only on natural surfaces and are prohibited from any metal, lava or other artificial surfaces in the game. Aside from the portals, important game elements include switches, boxes and huge rolling boulders which can crush the character. The player cannot save game progress. Because of the lack of a save feature, the game is actually quite short, as commented on by the modern Portal community. Being mostly a proof of applied concept, the game contains only six puzzles to solve. However, members of the Narbacular Drop forum community have created a catalog of custom maps.

The team developed Portal, which shares some things with Narbacular Drop's concept. In Portal, the player takes the role of a test subject tasked with trying out the \\"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\\", and along the way discovers that the test facility has been mysteriously abandoned. The main antagonist is a sentient artificial intelligence named GLaDOS, similar to the demon in Narbacular Drop. In Portal, one portal the player created was orange, the other portal blue, similar to the separate orange and blue eyed faces of Narbacular Drop. The game was released on October 10, 2007 on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as part of The Orange Box, to critical and commercial success. A sequel, Portal 2, was released on April 19, 2011.

Life and career Boyd spent four years in the Air Force and studied at the American Academy for Dramatic Arts. He did voice work (along with Wayland Flowers and Cleavon Little) for puppets on The Surprise Show, a children's program that aired locally in the New York City area in the late 1960s. The puppets used on the show, called Aniforms, had been developed by puppeteer Morey Bunin. In 1971, the Children‚Äôs Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) contacted Boyd because it wanted to use Aniforms in a television show that became known as The Electric Company. During the first season, Boyd‚Äôs voice was used extensively, especially for the character J. Arthur Crank, who was just an angry voice on the telephone at the time. Boyd was unseen until season two, when he became a regular cast member, appearing on-camera until the show stopped production in 1977. Other characters he played included Andy, Wolfman, Blue Beetle, Paul the Gorilla, Fred Baxter, Steve Awesome, and Lorelei Loverly. Boyd also appeared in the 1974 TV movie Out to Lunch, a Children‚Äôs Television Workshop production in which the Muppets and casts of Sesame Street and The Electric Company take over the ABC News when the newsroom staff takes a lunch break. In 1993, Boyd played the role of Howard Turner in the TV series Law & Order. In 2006, he appeared in the TV documentary The Electric Company's Greatest Hits & Bits, talking about his experience on The Electric Company in an interview. Boyd was the on-camera talent or voiceover talent for a number of \\"Industrial\\" videos for a large body of corporate training and communication videos in the 1990s.

The channel was programmed out of Cincinnati, Ohio, and sold to advertisers by Premiere Radio Networks. The terrestrial version is still free to air for HD Radio listeners on HD2 or HD3 stations owned by Clear Channel Communications in select radio markets. The channel was pulled on June 8, 2011, in favor of a simulcast of WLTW in New York City. History =Lite (2001‚Äì2002)= As part of an investment deal with Clear Channel Communications, XM agreed to simulcast some of Clear Channel's FM radio stations. Lite was one of the original four channels (named after Lite FM), and it simulcasted WLTW from New York City. With its popular adult contemporary format, WLTW has been the most profitable FM radio station in the US in recent years. Due to low subscription count at the time, XM's audience didn't concern themselves with the New York City locality of the station. After a couple years on the air, XM decided to move away from local simulcasts, and Lite became an exclusive-to-satellite station. However, the name Lite didn't stay. =Sunny (2002-2008)= Former XM 24 Logo as Sunny On August 26, 2002, the Lite FM simulcast was dropped and the channel became its own brand: Sunny. The station was now on autopilot 24/7 with no jocks. In February 2003 Sunny joined all XM music channels in going commercial-free, making the station auto-piloted 24/7 by music. This incarnation of XM's Sunny had a beautiful music format and was programmed by Marlin Taylor. (In response to Lite FM's demise on XM, XM launched The Blend, a commercial-free mainstream adult contemporary channel on February 2, 2004.) From 2002 to 2004, Sunny featured a format of nonstop Christmas music between Thanksgiving and Christmas each year. In March 2006, according to a 10-k filing, XM Satellite Radio mentioned that its Clear Channel-run music channels, including Sunny, would begin carrying commercials. This has been done to fulfill an arbitration settlement between XM and Clear Channel. In response to this, XM Canada, DirecTV and AOL Radio removed this channel on April 17 in favor of XM's commercial-free equivalent. Sunny now displays a \\"cm\\" next to its name on the XM unit's program-associated data to indicate that it is a commercial radio station. (As of May 5, the artist and song title is now displayed.) Various format switches On May 1, 2006, Sunny switched over to an adult standards style format, featuring more vocals and contemporary hits. A mix of big band hits and orchestral favorites, easy hits from the 1970s, oldies, some smooth jazz, and pop vocal standards figured in this nostalgic format. Concurrently, Escape on XM 78 replaced Sunny as the new \\"beautiful music\\" channel on XM. On June 5 of the same year, Sunny changed formats yet again. It was now \\"AM gold\\" and classic hits, with no more hit parade songs, orchestral instrumentals or smooth jazz vocals, but instead strictly soft pop hits from the 1960s through the 1980s. From November 19, 2006 to December 26, 2006, Sunny switched to a \\"holiday hits\\" format consisting of nonstop Christmas songs. Sunny was programmed in this period by Kevin Kash of DC101, until he was hired by XM to program hard-rock channel The Boneyard. On 2007-07-27, Sunny 24 made musical adjustments to become more of a pop 1970s and 1980s formatted channel, which included more Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, Genesis, etc. Musically the adjustments accommodated a slightly deeper library of hits. By May 2008, Sunny 24 was nearly equivalent to XM25's \\"The Blend\\", as many 1980s songs were added, and very few \\"AM Radio Hits of the '60s and '70s\\" remained. The end of Sunny After several format attempts, Clear Channel finally dropped the Sunny name on XM 24. It was discovered that the channel would soon become \\"The Pink Channel,\\" or simply \\"Pink.\\" There was never any official announcement before the channel launched. =The Pink Channel (2008-2010)= The Pink Channel launched on XM Radio on August 18, 2008 at midnight eastern time, as a partnership between Premiere Radio and City of Hope National Medical Center. The channel is dedicated to aiding the cause of fighting and finding a cure for cancer, as the color pink is associated with the cause. Along with the launch came a brand new website, Pink Channel Radio.com. The first song heard on the channel was Listen to the Music by the Doobie Brothers. Premiere Radio Networks officially announced the launching of the channel on August 18, 2008.PremiereRadio.com, Premiere Radio Networks Partners With City Of Hope To Launch The Pink Channel. 2008-08-18. The channel had a partnership between the Clear Channel subsidiary, and the City of Hope medical center in the Los Angeles area, specifically Duarte, CA to promote Cancer awareness and well being for just over a year. On March 9, 2009, the Pink Channel revised their playlist by dropping songs from earlier decades in favor of a smaller selection of current hits. The channel positions itself as \\"All Hit Radio\\", playing only current hits (excluding recurrent and gold songs) from the Hot Adult Contemporary format; classifying the channel as contemporary hit radio. On March 23, 2010, the Pink Channel changed its format to an adult album alternative playlist designed primarily for white females 18-45 and males 24-37. Key artists include: Annie Lennox, Indigo Girls, Sheryl Crow, KT Tunstall, Jack Johnson, Norah Jones, Chris Isaak, U2, R.E.M, Goo Goo Dolls, 10,000 Maniacs, Dave Matthews, Bob Marley, John Mayer and more. As of August 2010, the channel has removed all Pink related packaging and elements, and is now identifying itself as both \\"The Music Summit\\" and \\"The Summit\\" through short voiceovers, but the XM website and receivers continue to label it as The Pink Channel. It's retaining the same music format. =The Music Summit (2010-11)= In late August/early September 2010, The Music Summit branding took place, retaining the same format as the Pink Channel. XM receivers now display \\"Music Summit cm\\" and the XM website now reflects the name change. On June 8, 2011, the WLTW simulcast returned to this channel.

She is also a major stockholder in Tom.com, a publication and advertising company in the People's Republic of China. Early life and education Chau was born in 1961 as the daughter of a Hong Kong small time businessman. She attended the prestigious Diocesan Girls' School in Hong Kong, where was elected junior house captain. She sat the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination in 1978 and graduated in 1979. Upon her graduation, she went on to continue her education in Sydney, Australia at the University of New South Wales. Career After living in Australia, Chau lived and worked in London during the 1980s for a short period of time. During the late 1980s, she befriended Debbie Chang, who would eventually become one of her longest running business partners. Chau's first notable achievement within Hong Kong business circles was winning a project to build the Oriental Square in downtown Beijing in 1993. This project, and many others during her early career were accomplished in involvement with former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, Debbie Chang's cousin. Chau also met Li Ka-shing around this time, and the two would later become known for their close companionship and various business partnerships. In 1999, with Li's help, Chau set up Tom, a Chinese language media company, as a Cayman Island registered limited company as a minority (40%) partner together with Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings in a series of transactions which netted her an estimated US$11 million in cash even before the company began to trade. When Tom was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chau's investment in Tom grew to UCS$1.63 billion, making her the then second-richest woman in Hong Kong. In 2002, Chau invested RMB Ôø• 1 million into an interactive voice-recognition service provider, Beijing Leitingwuji Network Technology Company Limited (Âåó‰∫¨Èõ∑ÈúÜÊó†ÊûÅÁΩëÁªúÁßëÊäÄÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏). In September 2003, before the company was even profitable, she sold it to TOM Group for the sum of US$132 million. Its subsidiary TOM Online was then separately listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early 2004. Chau remained a 9.998% shareholder in Tom Online until 12 March 2007, when Tom Group announced an offer for the outstanding shares in Tom Online, to take the company private. Chau also has a 24% stake in TOM Group prior to the announcement. In 2002, Chau cofounded Horizons Ventures with Debbie Chang, who is the only person named as a director. Li Ka-shing only became an investor in the firm two years after its founding, but his backing as the richest man in Asia has helped the firm stand out above the crowd. Under Chau, Horizons Ventures has invested over US$470 million in more than 80 tech companies, in search of \\"disruptive\\" tech entrepreneurs. Its primary investments have been in the United States and Israel, with at least 28 investments in each country respectively since 2006. Chau has personally stated that her business interests center around nurturing Western companies, viewing them as more innovative. Chau has been noted to invest in companies very quickly, sometimes within 24 hours of startup owners, or immediately after a short coffee meeting. Chau typically brings investments ranging anywhere from $1 million to $20 million to the table. Horizons was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2006. With her direction, the Li Ka-shing foundation has also invested in tech giants such as Facebook, Slack, and Spotify. She was named one of Forbes Asia's 50 Women in the Mix in 2013. As of 2014, she is listed as the 81nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. Personal life Chau is well known for her decades long friendship with Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, who she met through a mutual friend in the 1990s. Li is 33 years her senior and is Chau's closest confidant, and the pair have backed and advised each other through many of their projects. Chau has been seen kneeling down in public to tie Li's shoelaces and holding his umbrella in the rain. Chau has compared their relationship to that of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote. In 2012, Chau sued Hong Kong distributor of Beijing- based Caijing under accusations of defamation, with the magazine having made claims of Chau accepting bribes from a mainland government official. Mainland courts ruled in December 2012 that Beijin Caijing Magazine Limited was liable for defamation and ordered the company to publish an apology. Chau's camp has accepted these terms.

It is a resident breeder in the Caribbean coastal lowlands from southeastern Mexico to central Panama, but is absent from El Salvador and southern Guatemala. It also occurs on the Pacific slope of Nicaragua and Honduras and northwestern Costa Rica. It is among the oropendola species sometimes separated in the genus Gymnostinops. The English and scientific names of this species commemorate the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. The sexes are very different in size; the male is long and weighs ; the smaller female is long and weighs . In total body mass, the males are 100% bigger than the females, which is a 2:1 body-to-mass ratio and makes the Montezuma oropendola one of the most sexually-dimorphic birds in the world. Webster et al. says that the size difference in males and females is probably directly related to differences in foraging habits. The females often forage on thin branches, eating insects out of curled up leaves, while the males often perch on thick branches and forage in epiphytes and bromeliads. Webster et al. also found that sexual dimorphism was more obvious in length of the wing and body mass. Male size and body mass is associated with sexual fitness and dominance. Webster et al. observed that males defend sexually-receptive females, suggesting that Montezuma oropendolas have a female-defence mating system. While the females nest, the males fight and fend off one another, and the males were ranked depending on the outcome of each fight. The alpha male eventually pushes out all other males until he is the only one left. When the alpha males leave the others come back and defend females until he returns. This type of mating system is similar to that of polygynous mammals, not birds. Adult males are mainly chestnut with a blackish head and rump, and a tail which is bright yellow apart from two dark central feathers. There is a bare blue cheek patch and a pink wattle, the iris is brown, and the long bill is black at the base with a red tip. Females are similar, but smaller than males with a smaller wattle. Young birds are duller than adults and have a paler and less demarcated bill. No subspecies are currently recognized. The \\"unforgettable\\"Howell, Steven N. G. & Webb, Sophie (1995): A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America. Oxford University Press, Oxford & New York. song of the male Montezuma oropendola is given during the bowing display, and consists of a conversational bubbling followed by loud gurgles, tic-tic-glik-glak-GLUUuuuuu. Both sexes have loud cack and crrrk calls. In a recent study by on male Montezuma oropendolas, researchers found that, when at breeding sites, males often changed the lowest peak frequency. When males were singing and their song overlapped, the largest male could out-compete the other males at the colony by changing how loud and how deep his lowest peak frequency was. Although the chestnut-headed oropendola shares much of this species's range, it is smaller, mainly black with a chestnut head (instead of mainly chestnut with a blackish head), and lacks coloured facial patches, so the two oropendolas are unlikely to be confused. Quesada, Costa Rica British Honduras stamp featuring a Montezuma oropendola The Montezuma oropendola is a quite common bird in parts of its range. They are omnivorous and are often seen in small or larger flocks foraging in trees for small vertebrates, large insects, nectar, and fruit, including bananas, Cecropia spikes, gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba) and Trophis racemosa (Moraceae).* Foster, Mercedes S. (2007): The potential of fruiting trees to enhance converted habitats for migrating birds in southern Mexico. Bird Conservation International 17(1): 45-61. PDF fulltext Outside the breeding season, this species is quite mobile, with some seasonal movements. The Montezuma oropendola inhabits forest canopy, edges and old plantations. It is a colonial breeder and only the females build hanging woven nest of fibres and vines, long, in a tree that is up to 30 meters high. Each colony has a dominant male, which mates with most of the females following an elaborate bowing display. The female lays two dark- spotted white or buff eggs, and she incubates them without the male until they hatch in 15 days; the young fledge in 30. While the young are still in their nests they are most often fed spiders and other arthropods, frogs, lizards, and fruits. There are typically about 30 nests in a colony, but up to 172 have been recorded. Unlike some populations of its relative, the chestnut-headed oropendola, the Montezuma oropendola does not tolerate brood parasites near their nests. Although Montezuma oropendolas do not have many defenses against Cowbirds, when females see a Giant Cowbird near their own nest they actively defend their nest by attacking the Cowbirds and forcing them to leave their colony. Webster et al. found that the females did not drive the cowbirds away until they were approaching their own nests. This study also found that unlike chestnut-headed oropendolas, the Montezuma oropendolas did not nest near social Hymenoptera. Combined with the fact that Montezuma oropendolas do not allow Cowbirds near their nest, they have no defense against botflies. Nest success is fairly low for the Montezuma Oropendola. The females lay an average of two eggs per nest, but only one is fledged and only one third of the nests in the colonies are successful. Because of their relatively low nest success rate, brood parasites are too high of a risk to have around the Montezuma oropendolas nest.

The fossil range is from the late Early Miocene to the Middle Miocene (22.5‚Äì11 Ma). Specimens Specifically the strata and regions from which Diatomys has been collected are: Shanwang series in Shandong province, China, Jiangsu province in China, Ky≈´sh≈´ in Japan, the Siwaliks in northern Pakistan, and Li Basin in Lamphun Province, Thailand. Li (1974) described Diatomys shantungensis on the basis of two moderately complete specimens from Shandong. This material had good preservation of dental characters, but much of the skull was difficult to interpret due to flattening. Dawson et al. (2006) reported the finding of another D. shantungensis fossil from Shandong that showed much improved preservation of cranial and skeletal characters. Impressions of hair and whiskers were observable in the specimen. Mein and Ginsburg (1985) described Diatomys liensis from Thailand, and considered it distinct enough to warrant recognition as separate from D. shantungensis. D. liensis was found to be smaller overall, with a higher molar crown height and distinctions in cusp morphology in the premolar and first molar.  Characteristics  Head and body was about . The overall appearance of Diatomys was thought to be very similar to the extant Laotian rock rat. The dental formula for Diatomys is . Incisors display multiserial enamel. The structure of the Hunter-Schreger bands is very similar to Laonastes. The root of the incisor is shortened. The cheek teeth are bilophodont, displaying two transverse ridges that are each slightly curved into a mild horseshoe shape. Cheek teeth have four roots on both the upper and lower jaws. The infraorbital canal is enlarged, presumably allowing for the passage of the medial masseter muscle as with other hystricomorphs. The mandible is sciurognathous. As with other diatomyids, Diatomys has no coronoid process and the masseteric fossa extends far forward to below the fourth premolar. The postcranial skeleton does not appear to have any unique specializations that might be associated with a fossorial, arboreal, or saltatorial way of life. This has led researchers to assume Diatomys was terrestrial.  Relationship  Several authors have suggested that Diatomys might belong to the family Pedetidae (McKenna and Bell, 1997) or be related to the pedetids (Mein and Ginsburg, 1997; Marivaux et al., 2004). Li (1974) also noted the possibility that it was related to geomyoids based on the bilophodont tooth. Dawson et al. (2006) determined that the closest known relative of Diatomys is the extant Laotian rock rat, a unique rodent first described in 2005 (Jenkins et al., 2004) from Khammouan, Laos. The remaining diatomyid in their analysis, Fallomus, was determined to be more distant.  References  *Dawson, M. R., L. Marivaux, C.-k. Li, K. C. Beard, and G. M√©tais. 2006.

The film is a sequel to the film Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), also directed by Hall. While Edward Everett Horton and James Gleason reprised their roles from the earlier film, Roland Culver replaced Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan. Plot Hayworth stars as the Muse Terpsichore who is annoyed that popular Broadway producer Danny Miller (Parks) is putting on a play which portrays the Muses as man-crazy tarts fighting for the attention of a pair of Air Force pilots who crashed on Mount Parnassus. She asks permission from Mr. Jordan to go to Earth and fix the play. Jordan agrees and sends Messenger 7013 (Horton) to keep an eye on her. Terpsichore uses the name Kitty Pendleton and quickly gets an agent, Max Corkle (Gleason), and a part in the show. As the play is being rehearsed, Kitty takes every chance she gets to tell Danny that his depictions of the Muses are wrong. Danny, who has fallen madly in love with Kitty, is soon persuaded to her point of view and alters the play from a musical farce to a high-minded ballet in the style of Martha Graham, scored by Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco. The revised play debuts on the road and is a complete flop. Danny, who is in debt to gangsters who will kill him if the show isn't a success, has no choice but to go back to his original concept. He and Kitty quarrel over this, and Kitty is ready to leave when Mr. Jordan shows up and explains the whole situation. Despite her argument with Danny, Kitty still loves him and decides to save him even if it means damaging her and her sisters' reputation. Max Corkle hears Kitty talking to Mr. Jordan and realizes this is the same heavenly messenger he had heard about in Here Comes Mr. Jordan. (Corkle makes a reference to the previous movie and tells Mr. Jordan that his old friend Joe Pendleton, now living his life as K.O. Murdock, is doing just fine - and has a wife and two children.) Kitty returns to the musical and performs \\"Swingin' the Muses\\" the way the producer had intended. When the musical becomes a hit, Terpsichore learns her time on Earth is up and she must return to Heaven. After getting Corkle to tell the police about the gangsters, she says she wants to stay with Danny‚Äîbut she is now invisible to mortals. Mr. Jordan says that she will see Danny again and grants her a vision of their eventual reunion in the Afterlife.

He was a son of the founding emperor Murong Chui (Emperor Wucheng) and a brother of Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin); for a while, he himself was a pretender to the Later Yan throne. He was known both for his abilities and his treachery, and he betrayed both his father and his brothers Murong Ling (ÊÖïÂÆπ‰ª§) and Murong Bao on separate occasions. Eventually, he was executed by his uncle Murong De, the founder of Southern Yan. Before Later Yan's founding The first reference to Murong Lin in history was in 369, when Murong Chui, then a Former Yan prince, fled to Former Qin after he came after suspicion of the emperor Murong Wei's mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun and the regent Murong Ping. Previously, Murong Chui's plan was to flee to the old capital Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning) and occupy it, and then seek reconciliation with Empress Dowager Kezuhun, but on the way, Murong Lin, who was then unfavored by Murong Chui, fled back to the capital Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei) and revealed his father's plans, forcing his father to readjust his plan and flee to Former Qin instead. For his treachery, however, Murong Lin appeared to be not appreciated by Empress Kezuhun, and he appeared to have been exiled to Longcheng as a soldier under the command of his cousin Murong Liang (ÊÖïÂÆπ‰∫Æ) the Prince of Bohai‚Äîor possibly to the even more remote Shacheng (Ê≤ôÂüé), described to be 300 kilometers northeast of Longcheng. In 370, after Murong Ling had been tricked by the Former Qin prime minister Wang Meng into defecting back to Former Yan, Murong Ling was exiled to Shacheng, and he started a rebellion with fellow exiles, planning to seize Longcheng, but Murong Lin revealed his plan to Murong Liang, who then prepared for the attack. Murong Ling's subordinate She Gui (Ê∏âÂú≠) then rose against him and killed him. As a result of Murong Lin's treachery, after Former Qin conquered Former Yan later in 370, and Murong Chui accompanied the Former Qin emperor Fu JiƒÅn in entering Yecheng, Murong Chui put Murong Lin's mother to death, but did not have the heart to execute Murong Lin as well, but only expelled him from the household and ordered him to live elsewhere. However, in late 383 and 384, as Murong Chui rose against Former Qin following Fu JiƒÅn's defeat at the Battle of Fei River at the hand of Jin troops, Murong Lin offered many useful strategies to his father, and his father changed his view of Murong Lin, favoring him as much as other sons. During Murong Chui's reign After Murong Chui officially declared independence and established Later Yan later in 384, Murong Lin served as one of his generals in campaigns against Former Qin remnants, semi-independent warlords, and other states. He appeared to be effective in these campaigns. In 386, Murong Chui created him the Prince of Zhao. In 386-387 and 390-391, he commanded armies to, in conjunction with the Later Yan vassal Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui, fight the Xiongnu chieftain Liu Xian (ÂäâÈ°Ø) and later other rebels that threatened Tuoba Gui's safety. It was in 391 when he saw Tuoba Gui's abilities, and he recommended to Murong Chui to force Tuoba Gui to take up residence at the Later Yan capital Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei) and entrust Northern Wei to a brother. Murong Chui refused. After Tuoba Gui renounced his allegiance to Later Yan (following Later Yan's seizure of his brother Tuoba Gu (ÊãìÊãîËßö) over a dispute of whether Northern Wei should offer horses as tributes) in 391, he began to harass Later Yan borders, and in 395, Murong Chui sent his crown prince Murong Bao to lead an expedition, with Murong Lin and Murong Nong the Prince of Liaoxi as his assistant commanders. However, during the campaign, as Later Yan and Northern Wei armies stalemated across the Yellow River near the Northern Wei capital Shengle (ÁõõÊ®Ç, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), Tuoba Gui spread false rumors that Murong Chui was dead, and Murong Lin's subordinates Muyu Song (ÊÖïËºøÂµ©) tried to start a coup to overthrow Murong Bao and make Murong Lin emperor, but was discovered and killed. This led to friction between the brothers, and the Later Yan forces withdrew. Murong Bao left Murong Lin to be rear guard against a Northern Wei attack, but Murong Lin did not take Tuoba Gui seriously and therefore did not look for Northern Wei troops, and Tuoba Gui intercepted Murong Bao's main forces at Canhe Slope and annihilated most of the troops, leading to further ambition by Tuoba Gui to eventually conquer Later Yan. In 396, Murong Chui personally led a campaign against Northern Wei that had initial successes, but as the army passed through Canhe Slope, they mourned in such a great manner that Murong Chui, in shame and anger, grew ill, and the army was forced to retreat. He died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Murong Bao. During Murong Bao's reign Despite the suspicions that they might have had of each other prior to the defeat at Canhe Slope, Murong Bao and Murong Lin reconciled, and Murong Lin was initially one of Murong Bao's most trusted generals. After Tuoba Gui defeated Murong Nong and seized Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern central and northern Shanxi), he headed for Zhongshan, and Murong Bao put Murong Lin in charge of Zhongshan's defenses. Murong Lin advocated defending the city and not engaging Northern Wei forces, much to Murong Nong and Murong Long's frustration. In spring 397, however, as Zhongshan remained under siege by Northern Wei forces, Murong Lin tried to start a coup inside the city to overthrow Murong Bao. After his attempt failed, he fled out of Zhongshan and took up post in the Taihang Mountains. Apprehensive that Murong Lin might seize relief forces commanded by Murong Hui the Prince of Qinghe, Murong Bao abandoned Zhongshan. The people of Zhongshan initially supported Murong Xiang (ÊÖïÂÆπË©≥) the Duke of Kaifeng as their leader to continue resisting Northern Wei. In summer 397, Murong Xiang claimed imperial title, but drew the anger of the people because he, apprehensive of Northern Wei forces (which had by then lifted siege on Zhongshan but had remained in the vicinity), refused to let the citizens, under a severe famine, to forage food outside the city, and was cruel in his rule. Murong Lin made a surprise attack on Zhongshan, whose gates were opened for him, and he arrested and killed Murong Xiang. Murong Lin then himself claimed imperial title and permitted the people to forage food‚Äîbut then, failed to take the opportunity after enough food was gathered to engage Northern Wei forces, and eventually, as wild food dwindled, Northern Wei forces defeated him and captured Zhongshan. He fled to Yecheng to the protection of his uncle Murong De the Prince of Fanyang (and no longer mentioned his imperial claims). Murong Lin advised Murong De that Yecheng was too large of a city to defend, and that he should consider abandoning it and taking up position at Huatai (ÊªëÂè∞, in modern Anyang, Henan) south of the Yellow River. Murong De agreed and abandoned Yecheng, taking up residence at Huatai. Then, Murong Lin offered imperial title to Murong De, who did not take such title but assumed imperial powers under the title Prince of Yan, thus establishing Southern Yan. He made Murong Lin a key general, but Murong Lin then planned another rebellion, and Murong De executed him.

The film portrays wartime romance and tragedy in a London musical show, loosely modelled on the Windmill Theatre in Soho, that determined not to miss a single performance during the Blitz. Hayworth plays an American showgirl who falls in love with an RAF pilot played by Bowman. The film was adapted from the play Heart of a City by Lesley Storm. It was used as a Technicolor vehicle for Rita Hayworth after her success with Cover Girl. It was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Music, Original Song (for \\"Anywhere\\") and Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture. A major highlight of the film is Hayworth in the \\"You Excite Me\\" number, a number often cited as one of Hayworth's best performances. Plot Rita Hayworth in Tonight and Every Night. Behind her is an uncredited Shelley Winters Near the end of the war, a reporter from Life magazine comes to the Music Box Theatre in London to write a story about the music hall that never missed putting on a performance during the Blitz. Stage manager Sam Royce recalls the halcyon days at the beginning of the war: Theatrical impresario May \\"Tolly\\" Tolliver is rehearsing her performers when dancer Tommy Lawson comes to audition. Although Tommy is a naturally gifted dancer, he improvises all his steps and consequently, Tolly refuses to hire him. Taking pity on Tommy, Americans Rosalind Bruce and Judy Kane, members of the troupe, teach him their routines, and he wins a part in the show. One night, RAF pilot Paul Lundy comes to the theater and is infatuated with Ros. When German planes discharge their bombs over the theater, the audience and performers take refuge in the building's basement, and there Paul meets Ros and invites her to dinner. Ros refuses his invitation, but after the raid, she and Judy stop by the neighborhood restaurant, and Paul is waiting with champagne. Ros begins to date Paul, but when he tricks her into coming to his apartment by promising to introduce her to a non-existent soldier from her home town of St. Louis, she feels betrayed and refuses to talk to him. Desperate to see Ros, Paul convinces his group captain to request that the Music Box troupe appear at the upcoming RAF theatrical. At the RAF show, Paul begs Ros to forgive him, and when he is called away on a mission, she relents and accepts his confession of love. Tommy, who is also in love with Ros, begins to drink to dull the pain of rejection. After Paul returns from his assignment, he tells Ros that he must leave again the next morning, and the two plan to spend an intimate evening at Paul's apartment. When they arrive, however, they find that Paul's building has been flattened in a German bombing raid. The next day, Paul is planning to propose to Ros when he is called into his group captain's office and ordered to leave immediately on a secret assignment. Two weeks pass without word from Paul, causing Ros to worry. One night, Ros sees several flyers from Paul's squadron, and when they tell her that the entire squadron has been on a two-week leave, Ros believes that Paul has lost interest in their romance. When Ros receives a note from Paul's father, Reverend Gerald Lundy, asking to meet her after the show that night, she assumes that Paul has sent him as an emissary to terminate their relationship. Ros is relieved when Reverend Lundy explains that Paul has been assigned a special mission and shows her a Bible that Paul had sent to his father. The Reverend opens the Bible to the page marked by Ros's picture, and on that page, a passage, proposing marriage, is highlighted. The Reverend then proposes for his absent son and welcomes Ros to the family. Upon learning of Paul's proposal, Tommy jealously predicts that Ros will desert the theater. When Paul returns soon after and asks Ros to honeymoon in Canada, she refuses to leave the troupe until Tommy offers his congratulations and insists that she go. Afterward, Judy, who is secretly in love with Tommy, goes to console him at the pub, and after drinking a toast to Ros, they kiss. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as a German bomb strikes the pub, killing them both. Despite the tragedy, the night's performance goes on, and as Ros sings Judy's song, she determines to stay with the show.

He would, with various budget related alterations, base its design on an opera house that he had conceptualized for the city of Baghdad, Iraq sometime prior upon the invitation of King Faisal II. Plans for the Baghdad opera house were abandoned after the King's assassination in the 14 July Revolution.http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/09/29/hln.hot.eye.baghdad.architecture/ Wright is also said to be responsible for the 1200 South Forest Avenue location of the circular auditorium, a site which was then occupied by an athletic field, and earlier by G.I. housing units.http://www.statepress.com/article/2015/11/an-abridged-history-of-mill- avenue-the-grandiose-and-important-asu-gammage Wright and Gammage both died in 1959, leaving Wright's prot√©g√© William Wesley Peters to undertake completion of the auditorium.

The film is a biopic of 1890s composer and songwriter Paul Dresser and singer Sally Elliot. It was based on a biographical essay, sometimes erroneously referred to as a book, by Dresser's younger brother, novelist Theodore Dreiser. (Dreiser was the original family name.) Some of the songs portrayed as Dresser's work were actually written by him, but several were created for the film by the Hollywood songwriting team of Ralph Grainger and Leo Robin. Plot summary Sally Elliott (Rita Hayworth), a musical star meets up with Indiana boy Paul Dresser (Victor Mature), a runaway who after a brief stopover with a medicine show arrives in Gay Nineties New York. He composes the title tune for the fair lady and becomes the toast of Tin Pan Alley.

Sullivan * Iron Eyes Cody as Indian (uncredited) * George Melford as Conductor (uncredited) Choreographer Hermes Pan appears as Hayworth's dance partner in the \\"Gay White Way\\" number. Awards The film won the Best Art Direction (Richard Day, Joseph C. Wright and Thomas Little). It was nominated for Best Score. Production 20th Century Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck purchased the story of My Gal Sal from Theodore Dreiser for $50,000 in the summer of 1942. Zanuck initially had the script and the lead role of Sally Elliott tailor-made to fit the talents of Fox's biggest female star at the time, Alice Faye. Faye was going to star with Carole Landis, George Montgomery, and John Shepperd. However, Faye stated that she was tired of starring in costume musicals and turned the film down. Afterward, the part was offered to Betty Grable, who was becoming known as a successor to Faye at Fox, but who turned it down, believing Fox was over-working her. Zanuck thereafter had the script rewritten and redirected to showcase Irene Dunne, but her busy film schedule meant holding up production on My Gal Sal for eighteen months. Zanuck subsequently approached Mae West with the role, but she too turned it down. To this end, Zanuck considered grooming newcomer Carole Landis for the part, but her screen test failed to impress the producers. Despite not winning the part of Sally Elliott, Landis did end up playing the secondary lead of Mae Collins in the film, because she had already been publicized to be appearing the film. Zanuck finally approached Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures, about borrowing Rita Hayworth for the film. Zanuck had been impressed with Hayworth's performance in the 1941 film version of Blood and Sand, also for Fox. Cohn, on the other hand, was hoping to buy My Gal Sal from Fox and cast Hayworth in the part upon the film's transfer to Columbia. Zanuck, however, rebuffed at selling the film, but instead offered Hayworth an exclusive two-movie contract to star in My Gal Sal and Tales of Manhattan (1942). Cohn eventually agreed to loan Hayworth to Fox for both movies. Victor Mature's role was originally meant to be played by Don Ameche. Reception My Gal Sal received positive reviews upon its 1942 release. Daily Variety said the film was a very \\"lively, merry musical treat. A pricture crammed with color, songs, and movement, carrying broad appeal for all theatergoers, both young and old.\\" Hayworth was proclaimed to have done a \\"beautiful job\\" as Sally, while Victor Mature turned out an \\"impressing performance\\" as Dresser. Life stated: My Gal Sal hits a current demand, both in the movies and in radio, for the nostalgic delights of the 1890s.\\" The film went on to become one of the most-successful Fox films during 1942. Some of Rita Hayworth's lines were sampled in the Pet Shop Boys 1996 track \\"Electricity.\\" The film happened to be playing on television while the track was being recorded, and was not publicly identified until 2019.

The picture was nominated for an Academy Award in 1941 for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and features songs such as \\"The Band Played On\\", \\"Bill Bailey\\", \\"Meet Me in St. Louis, Louie\\", \\"Wait Till The Sun Shines Nellie\\", and \\"Love Me and the World Is Mine\\". The title is most often listed beginning with the word The (as it appears in the opening credits), but the film's posters and promotional materials call it simply Strawberry Blonde. Director Walsh remade the film in 1948 as One Sunday Afternoon. It was a remake of One Sunday Afternoon (1933) with Gary Cooper. Synopsis In 1890s New York City, Biff Grimes (James Cagney) falls in love with strawberry-blonde society girl Virginia Brush (Rita Hayworth). However, Biff's more enterprising \\"pal\\" Hugo Barnstead (Jack Carson) wins Virginia's affections. Biff ends up marrying Virginia's less- glamorous best friend, Amy Lind (Olivia de Havilland), who Biff eventually realizes was the right one for him all along. Cast * James Cagney as T. L.

Raoul Walsh: The True Adventures of Hollywood's Legendary Director. Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky. . p. 198 Walsh had just completed the dark Humphrey Bogart/Ida Lupino vehicle High Sierra, shot largely on location, and the good notices the film received had Walsh \\"as fired up as Jack Warner to keep the ball rolling on projects in development and production.\\"Moss, p. 198 The transition between the outdoorsy film noir and the light and sentimental studio-centered Strawberry Blonde \\"proved no problem\\" for Walsh. Cagney had earned his stripes with Warner Bros. in the early 1930s playing tough guys, but he also had shown his talents at lighter, musical material in films like Footlight Parade (1933)Warren, Doug, and James Cagney (1986). Cagney: The Authorized Biography. New York: St. Martin's Press. . p. 101 He left the studio in mid-decade, then returned in 1938 with a contract that gave him more control in choosing roles and brought his younger brother William Cagney onboard as assistant producer and informal buffer between himself and studio executives.Warren, p. 124 But Cagney soon found himself getting slotted right back into tough guy parts and by 1940, he \\"wanted a nostalgic part‚Äîany part‚Äîto take him away from the gangsters he was now loathe [sic] to play.\\"Moss, p. 200 A property on the lot that might fill that bill was One Sunday Afternoon. It had started out early in 1933 as a successful Broadway play by James HaganHalliwell, Leslie with John Walker, ed. (1994). Halliwell's Film Guide. New York: HarperPerennial. . p. 894 and had been adapted later that year by Paramount as a vehicle for Gary Cooper. But it was \\"the only real flop of Cooper's stellar and carefully orchestrated career\\"Moss, p. 199‚Äîand the only Cooper picture ever to lose money. James Cagney had qualms about it because it would be a remake,Moss, p. 200 and Jack Warner knew it needed \\"complete retooling.\\" But it was a \\"pet project\\" of William Cagney, who saw it as a \\"gift to [the brothers'] mother, Carrie Cagney, who would live only a few more years\\" and Warner recognized the inside track that would give him with his often recalcitrant star. Warner screened the 1933 film and wrote a memo to his production head Hal B. Wallis telling him to watch it also: \\"It will be hard to stay through the entire running of the picture, but do this so you will know what not to do.\\" Wallis knew the trick was to tailor the script as a vehicle for Cagney, who had yet to commit, either to the project or even to his brother. Wallis had a first draft screenplay done by Stephen Morehouse Avery that satisfied no one;McGilligan, Patrick (1986). Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood's Golden Age. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. . p. 180 he called in the Epstein brothers, Julius and Phillip, for another vision‚Äîone that might hook Cagney into the project. The brothers and William all concurred that the first thing to do was move things from the play's midwest setting to New York City, \\"since they all knew it so much better.\\"Moss, p. 200 Said Julius: \\"We thought the reason [the Cooper film] lost money was it was too bucolic. It took place in a little country town. We said 'Change it to the big city. Put it in New York.'\\"McGilligan, p. 180 The Epstein version quickly took shape, aided by the objective of making it a Cagney picture. \\"When we went on the rewrite,\\" Julius said, \\"we knew it was for Cagney. That was a help.\\" Yet still Cagney was reluctant. Wallis was getting impatient; he considered the emerging John Garfield for the role of Biff Grimes. By July 1940, concern about the impasse stretched all the way to New York, where Harry Warner cabled brother Jack that he was willing to give Cagney 10% of the gross. Then Cagney began to budge. One issue was that he didn't want to play scenes with the much-taller Jack Carson; he would prefer the shorter Brian Donlevy, or the shorter-still Lloyd Nolan. The problem was, Nolan commanded $2,000 a week while Carson got just $750. Despite Cagney's misgivings, Carson was cast as Hugo Barnstead. More problematic was the casting of the Virginia Brush role, which was originally created for Ann Sheridan, the studio's \\"Oomph Girl\\".Katz, Ephraim, Fred Klein and Ronald Dean Nolen (2005). The Film Encyclopedia. New York: Harper Collins. . p. 1284 But Sheridan was in one of her contract disputes with the studio and refused to do the film. Jack Warner asked Walsh to talk Sheridan into it, but she still refused. Wallis tested actress Brenda Marshall for the part, but Walsh spoke up about \\"a girl\\" he had seen in several Columbia pictures: young Rita Hayworth. \\"He thought she was perfect for the part, and after she was signed without a hitch, from then on he always referred to Hayworth as his 'find' (despite [the splash she had made in] Only Angels Have Wings released in 1939).\\" Hayworth received $450 a week for the film and began work immediately with makeup man Perc Westmore to find the look for the title character in what would soon be retitled Strawberry Blonde. After shooting test footage and many stills of his makeup experiments, Westmore memoed Wallis: \\"Her head is so large and she has so much hair that it will practically be impossible to put a wig on her. Whatever color you decide on, she will be happy to have it made that color. Then at the end of the picture, we will dye it back to its natural color.\\"Moss, p. 201 This film marked the first time Hayworth was seen as a redhead and the only time that audiences heard her real singing voice. The shooting of Strawberry Blonde began on October 21, 1940. Wallis and Walsh quickly came to loggerheads. The producer thought his director was coming in too close on the actors, that the close-ups decreased the nostalgia by obscuring the period backgrounds. Wallis's October 29, 1940 memo chided \\"You have so much opportunity on this picture for atmosphere and composition... and I hate like hell to see them go by without full advantage being taken of what we have.\\" (Several months later, with Michael Curtiz on Yankee Doodle Dandy, Wallis's complaints would be just the opposite: \\"Mike, get the story from the actors' faces, instead of going all over the place.\\")Moss, p. 202 Walsh in reality had \\"memorized the entire script and had worked out every camera angle and move‚Äîa visual map of just how he would shoot.\\" As the footage continued to flow in, the memos slowed, then stopped. Olivia de Havilland had no idea of the friction between the two, no problem with the closeups, and she debunked Walsh's reputation as a tough guy. \\"I loved working with Raoul. He seemed to understand perfectly the characters we were playing, and to understand, too, the 'actor' approach to them. It was a happy, harmonious set, a happy picture to make.\\" The screenwriters too found Walsh a good boss. Julius Epstein said he \\"was great. He was very businesslike. He didn't change a word on The Strawberry Blonde. Some writers complained about Walsh. My experience with him was very good.\\" When Warner Bros. released Strawberry Blonde on February 21, 1941, \\"the studio knew it had a hit on its hands.\\"Moss, p. 203 Walsh considered it his most successful picture to date, and from then on would call it his favorite film.

Olivia de Havilland is sweet and sympathetic as the girl he marries and Rita Hayworth makes a classic 'flirt' of the one who got away.\\" Part of it also came from the screenplay by Casablanca writers Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein: they took \\"the little play, One Sunday Afternoon... and fashioned from it a gas-lit comedy, laced with sentimental romance, about a fellow who thinks he's been played for a chump, but, in the end, discovers that he's the winner.\\" Crowther also liked the supporting performances of George Tobias and Jack Carson. The entertainment trade publication Variety liked it as well: \\"Cagney and de Havilland provide topnotch performances that do much to keep up interest in the proceedings. Rita Hayworth is an eyeful as the title character, while Jack Carson is excellent as the politically ambitious antagonist of the dentist.\\"Variety, February 12, 1941 In Halliwell's Film Guide (1994), reviewer Leslie Halliwell describes the production as a \\"pleasant period comedy drama\\" and recognizes its three stars and cinematographer James Wong Howe for their outstanding contributions.Halliwell, p. 1140 In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

The film stars Rita Hayworth as the gypsy Carmen and Glenn Ford as her doomed lover Don Jos√©. The Loves of Carmen was publicized as a dramatic adaptation of the novella Carmen by Prosper M√©rim√©e and is otherwise unrelated to Georges Bizet's opera Carmen. It is a remake of the 1927 film of the same name, which was directed by Raoul Walsh and stars Dolores del R√≠o and Victor McLaglen. The film reunited the stars, writer and director of Gilda. It was Hayworth's last film for four years. Plot In Spain, during the early nineteenth century, Don Jose Lizarabengoa arrives in Seville to begin service as a corporal in the Spanish dragoons. He meets Carmen, a gypsy, who steals his watch, and becomes obsessed with her. Carmen slashes the face of a peasant woman who insults her. Jose is ordered to arrest Carmen but allows her to escape. For this Jose is demoted and confined to guard duty. Jose's commanding officer, the colonel, also falls in love with Carmen. A fortune teller warns Carmen she will be killed by a man she really loves. She goes to meet Jose, who is discovered by the colonel. The colonel challenges Jose to a duel during which Carmen trips the officer, causing him to fall on Jose's sword and die. Jose is wanted for murder. He and Carmen flee to the mountains where Jose discovers Carmen is married to Garcia, the leader of a gang of bandits. Jose and Garcia have a knife fight in which Garcia is killed. Jose marries Carmen and takes over the gang, but the couple keep fighting. Carmen goes to Cordoba and becomes the lover of the bullfighter Lucas. Pablo, one of the bandits, betrays Jose to the police for a reward. Jose tracks down Carmen, who refuses to return to him. She spits on him, he stabs her, and a policeman shoots Jose, mortally wounding him. Carmen and Jose die in each other's arms.

As co-producer, Hayworth hired her father, the dancer Eduardo Cansino, to help choreograph the traditional Spanish dances. Also, her uncle Jos√© Cansino can be seen as her dance partner in one scene, and her brother Vernon Cansino has a bit part as a soldier. Gar Moore and Gig Young were reportedly among those who tested for the male lead. In November 1947 Columbia announced that Glenn Ford would play the part. Virginia Van Upp did a last minute rewrite of the script.

Goble is a staff member at the Purdue University Engineering Computer Network and a 1996 Ig Nobel Prize winner. Goble is commonly known as \\"ghg\\" since he has used that as a login id, and signature in digital communications, since the 1970s. He received his BS, MS, and PhD in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University. In 1981, he wired together the backplanes of two DEC VAX-11/780's and made the first multi-CPU Unix computer, preceding DEC's dual processor VAX-11/782. The operating system was based on the 4.2 BSD kernel, and the modifications thus eventually made it into the 4.3 BSD Unix release. At the beginning of the 4.3 BSD user manuals, Bill Joy wrote a special note of thanks to GHG for being courageous enough to put the multi-CPU kernel into a production environment before anyone else did. (However, the frequent crashes for a while inspired the writing of many humorous text files by the Purdue University Electrical Engineering student body, such as \\"The VAX had a Blowout\\", to be sung to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down). The development of the Dual-CPU Unix system was the subject of Goble's Master's thesis. Around this time, Goble also developed a networking protocol for Unix, referred to as pnet, which was used at Purdue at the time before being displaced by TCP/IP. Pnet allowed remote logins, and remote execution of commands, among other capabilities. In the late 1980s, Goble started experimenting with refrigerants, due to increased danger and lower thermodynamic efficiency of the recently introduced R-134a compared to the older R-12 which was being phased out due to concerns about damage to the ozone layer, and the incompatibility of R-134a with the lubricating oil and other materials used in systems built for R-12. In 1987, he converted the beverage refrigerators in the Eta Kappa Nu lounge in the basement of the Purdue Electrical Engineering building to using a refrigerant of his own devising. This refrigerant is now recognized as R-406A by ASHRAE and is available commercially under the trade name AutoFrost. He later developed another refrigerant which is compatible with R134A lubricants, but which is superior in thermodynamic efficiency and lower system internal pressures called GHG-X8. In 1996, Goble was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry, for preparing a barbecue for cooking in less than 5 seconds by the use of a smoldering cigarette, charcoal and LOX (liquid oxygen). This act attracted the attention of the West Lafayette, Indiana fire department, which warned him to never let them catch him in the possession of LOX near a barbecue fire ever again. Goble is also noted for driving a vehicle with the Indiana license plate UNIX, and now also GHG-1.

Original series The Gunhawks were Kid Cassidy and Reno Jones. As introduced in Gunhawks #1 (1972), Cassidy was the son of a plantation-owning family in the antebellum American South, and Jones was an African American slave of the family who was friends with Cassidy. They fought together for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, with Jones fighting the Union because their soldiers had kidnapped his lover, Rachel Brown. After the war, they became wandering gunfighters, the Gunhawks, and continued searching for Rachel. During the course of Gunhawks #6 (1973), Kid Cassidy was shot and killed, and Jones was blamed for the crime. (During the storyline in Avengers Forever, published from 1998 until 2000, the Avenger Hawkeye revealed that Cassidy had been killed prior to 1873).Avengers Forever #5 With the next issue, the series was retitled to Reno Jones, Gunhawk, making Jones Marvel's second black character to have his own self-titled series, after Luke Cage, Hero for Hire (the Black Panther had taken over the lead in the Jungle Action series a few months prior, but the Panther's name was not included in the series' title). As it turned out, Reno Jones, Gunhawk #7 was also the final issue of the series, and the Gunhawks vanished into obscurity. A promised resolution to the storyline in Marvel Western Team-Up was never published.Reno Jones, Gunhawk #7https://www.comics.org/issue/26769/ See Indexer's Notes Modern versions In John Ostrander and Leonardo Manco's 2000 miniseries Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes, the Gunhawks returned, but in a greatly modified form. It was \\"revealed\\" that the published adventures of the classic Marvel gunfighters, including the Gunhawks, had actually been dime novels based on the actual gunfighters' actions. In this revised version of events, Jones was actually a slave on Cassidy's family's plantation, the two men had only been friends as children, and Jones had actually shot Cassidy in self-defense. Reno Jones took up residence in the town of Wonderment, Montana, a town populated largely by freed slaves; there, he married a woman named Mary, and they had a son named Cass. A corrupt businessman named Clay Riley - who had previously fought the original Ghost Rider as a costumed bandit called the Tarantula - sought to take the town's land by force. To this end, he hired a group of the Ku Klux Klan's Nightriders to kill the townfolk, prompting Jones to bring in a number of Western gunfighters to defend the town. One of those men was the Red Wolf, who had been a contemporary and ally of the deceased Ghost Rider. He provided Jones with the Rider's costume, knowing that this would give him a psychological advantage over Riley. After many fatalities on both sides, Jones killed Riley and then unmasked the Nightriders' leader as Kid Cassidy. Before either could fully react, the Outlaw Kid stunned Cassidy, and Jones took the opportunity to strangle Cassidy to death. After the carnage was over, Jones returned the Ghost Rider costume and retired to take care of his family. Later, following the Apache Skies miniseries, the Rawhide Kid and the new Apache Kid entrusted the people of Wonderment with the care of a number of American Indian children who had been bound for U.S. government custody.

It is located west of downtown, along the Lake Ontario shore at the intersection of The Queensway and Sunnyside Avenue, just west of Roncesvalles Avenue. It was founded in 1921 by the Sisters of St. Joseph order on the site of an orphanage. The same order also founded St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in 1892. Overview St. Joseph's Health Centre receives more than 97,000 emergency room visits every year, and sees more than 272,000 visits in its outpatient ambulatory care clinics. More than 21,000 patients are admitted to a hospital bed every year, with an average stay of five to six days and an occupancy rate of 100%. Yearly, more than 3,000 children are born at St. Joseph's. Over 160,000 diagnostic imaging procedures are done every year and more than 30,000 surgeries. St. Joseph's is affiliated with the University of Toronto and accepts placement trainees in various specialties. Trainees are placed through U of T, and include students of other university medical programs. Over 800 trainees are placed at St. Joseph's and 200 faculty members at U of T. The medical education program is administered by the Department of Medical Education & Scholarship. St. Joseph's also accepts nursing trainees from universities and colleges. Newsweek ranked the hospital 9th in Toronto in 2019.

It offers patient education, health promotion, disease prevention and chronic disease management programs. The Emergency Clinic is located on the west side of the hospital, on Glendale Avenue. It is a streamed clinic, with adults streamed into one clinic, and children into another. St. Joseph's wait times are regularly monitored by the Ontario Ministry of Health. In 2012, St. Joseph's Health Centre had one of the lowest wait times in Ontario to see a doctor. The Ambulatory Clinic is a day-time clinic for non-emergency visits for patients needing immediate medical attention. The Ambulatory Clinic is also located in the Glendale wing. History The original site at Sunnyside Avenue, and The Queensway, was the site of the 1800s Sunnyside Villa and farm, a home of John George Howard, surveyor of Toronto. The Sacred Heart Orphanage was built on the site, operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph order. In 1921, the City of Toronto was considering expropriating the orphanage for a public high school. The order decided to convert part of the orphanage into a hospital to prevent expropriation, and St. Joseph's was founded. In 1939, the Sisters of St. Joseph moved its Mercy Hospital for Incurables long-term care hospital to a new facility north of St. Joseph's Hospital proper. Known as Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, it operated independently until 1980, when it was merged with St. Joseph's Hospital. The Our Lady of Mercy Wing, as it was known, was demolished in 2007. In 2012, the replacement Our Lady of Mercy Wing opened. It is a four- storey building housing a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a Paediatric Unit, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, an expanded Family Birthing Centre, and three new inpatient areas housing a total of 92 beds. On 1 August 2017, St. Joseph's Health Centre merged with St. Michael's Hospital and Providence Healthcare to form a new hospital network called Unity Health Toronto. =Notable dates= *1921 - St. Joseph's Hospital was founded in 1921 on the site of the Sacred Heart Orphanage.

They deployed to American Samoa on September 14, 1942, and were attached to the 2nd Marine Brigade. The regiment redeployed to New Zealand on May 23, 1943, and were reassigned to the 3rd Marine Division at that time. The regiment fought at Bougainville and Guam. Four Medals of Honor were awarded to members of 3rd Marines for actions during this period. Members of the unit also took part in the Agana race riot while stationed on Guam. During the Battle of Iwo Jima the 3rd Marines were kept in Reserve and were not sent ashore. Following World War II, the regiment was ordered to China to aid in the disarming of Japanese units and to assist the Nationalist government in the occupation of Northern China in an effort to deny land to the communists. =Vietnam War= 2nd Battalion in action during the Battle of Khe Sanh 3rd Marines was one of the first Marine units into South Vietnam when it provided security for the Da Nang Air Base in early 1965. Ultimately, 3d Marines participated in 48 major operations in the Republic of Vietnam. The regiment departed South Vietnam in October 1969 and was initially relocated to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California and assigned to the 5th Marine Amphibious Brigade. During April 1971, the regiment became part of the 1st Marine Division. Two months later, the regiment was moved to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, to assume the role of the ground combat component of the 1st Marine Brigade. =1980s & 1990s= Marines of 1st Battalion during the Gulf War ground campaign in February 1991 Task Force Taro 3rd Marines was one of the first combat forces to deploy to Saudi Arabia in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. The regiment, which became known as Task Force Taro in honor of the state and people of Hawaii, became the first American unit to be engaged by Iraqi artillery, rocket and missile fire on January 18, 1991. They countered the Iraqi supporting attacks by conducting artillery raids into Kuwait as the first ground offensive actions of the war. Task force Taro was instrumental in the recapture of Khafji, was the first unit to advance into Kuwait, conducted the only heliborne assault of the war and secured the Marine Corps' final objective of the war, Kuwait International Airport. Following the cease-fire on February 28, 1991, the regiment redeployed to Saudi Arabia and subsequently completed its strategic redeployment to Hawaii two months later. =2000s= The 3rd Marines has deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the Global War on Terror. One of their officers, Stephen J. Boada, was awarded the Silver Star for actions there. He became the first Marine in the regiment and from Hawaii to be awarded one of the major awards for valor since the Vietnam War.

Originally the capital and largest city of the Punjab region, it has since its creation changed hands from Jain, Hindu, Buddhist, Greek, Muslim, Mughal, Afghan, Sikh and the British, thereby becoming the cultural capital and the heart of modern-day Pakistan.  Origins  An old street-scene in Lahore. According to oral traditions, Lahore was named after Lava, son of the Hindu god Rama, who supposedly founded the city. Lahore Fort has a vacant temple dedicated in honour of Lava. Likewise, the Ravi River that flows through northern Lahore was said to be named in honour of the Hindu goddess Durga. Ptolemy, the celebrated astronomer and geographer, mentions in his Geographia a city called LaboklaImperial Gazetteer of India, v. 16, p. 106 situated on the route between the Indus river in a region described as extending along the rivers Bidastes or Vitasta (Jhelum), Sandabal or Chandra Bhaga (Chenab), and Adris or Iravati (Ravi). The oldest authentic document about Lahore was written anonymously in 982 and is called Hudud-i- Alam.HUDUD AL-'ALAM 'The Regions of the World' A Persian Geography It was translated into English by Vladimir Fedorovich Minorsky and published in Lahore in 1927. In this document, Lahore is referred to as a small shahr (city) with \\"impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards.\\" It refers to \\"two major markets around which dwellings exist,\\" and it also mentions \\"the mud walls that enclose these two dwellings to make it one.\\" The original document is currently held in the British Museum.Dawn Pakistan ‚Äì The 'shroud' over Lahore's antiquity Jain Heritage Plutarch as well as many other scholars suggest that Jainism was the most ancient and original religion in Punjab. Lahore was the cultural centre of Jainism. A book written by Plutarch, Life of Alexander talks about the encounters between Alexander the Great and digambara Jain saints called gymnosophists.https://www.dawn.com/news/1221387 Bhabra or Bhabhra is an ancient merchant community from Punjab region which mainly follows Jainism. It is believed to be connected with the Bhavadar or Bhavada Gachchha to which the Jain Acharya Kalakacharya belonged to. They may have originated from the Bhabra town (32¬∞ 13' 30\\": 73¬∞ 13').Sarupa-Bharati: Or the Homage of Indology, Being the Dr. Lakshman Sarup ...by Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research Institute - Indic studies - 1953 - Page 247 Inscriptions suggest that Bhavada Gachchha had survived until the 17th century. There were Jain temples at localities still called Thari Bhabrian and Gali Bhabrian.  Hindu heritage  An 1876 engraving of Rajputs, from the Illustrated London News. The city of Lahore has a Gurjara origin. The earliest princes were said to be traditional Gurjar. Hieun Tsang, the Chinese traveller, who visited the Punjab in 630 AD, speaks of a large city, containing many thousands of families, chiefly Brahmans, situated on the eastern frontier of the kingdom of Cheka, which he says, extended from the Indus to the Beas river. Around 580 BC., when king Bimbisara ruled South Asia, the society came to be divided into different communities based on their occupation. One of their communities was called Kshatriyas and King Luv's descendants were classed with them and came to be known as Luvanam, which was also referred to as Luvana. The Luvanas from Loharghat became known as Loharana (masters of swords; or iron (\\"Loha\\") chiefs (\\"Rana\\")), which later became Lohana. Chinese traveller Faxian, who visited South Asia between 337 and 472 CE, calls Lohana a brave community ruling the northwest territory of South Asia, in his diary. Another Chinese traveler, Kurmang who came in the eleventh century A.D. speaks of a Lohrana kingdom as a mighty power. Historian Burton writes Lohanas were brave people and says they were spread over today's Baluchistan (Pakistan), Afghanistan and eastern fringes of Central Asia. Col. Todd, who delved into history of Rajasthan, describes Lohanas as one of the oldest Kshatriya community. = The old Hindu city = Present view of the Ichhra Bazaar (Market) at night. The market, because of being designed in very old style is very narrow for vehicles to cross and shoppers to walk. Many historians agree that Lahore was founded by an ancient Hindu colony sometime between the first and seventh centuries, probably as early as the beginning of the second; that it soon rose to be a place of importance, the parent of other colonies, and eventually the capital of a powerful principality, to which it gave its name. There are some grounds supporting that the old Hindu city of Lahore did not occupy exactly the site of the modern city. Tradition points the site of old Lahore to the vicinity of Ichhra ‚Äì which is now a part of Lahore city ‚Äì but was back then a village about three miles to the west. The name of the village was formerly Icchra Lahore. Moreover, some of the oldest and most sacred Hindu shrines are found within this locality, namely Bhairo ka sthain and the Chandrat. The gate of the present city, known as the Lahori or Lohari Gate was so called as being the gateway looking in the direction of Lohawar or old Lahore just as the Kashmiri Gate looks towards Kashmir, and the Delhi Gate of modern Delhi to the ancient city of that name. There are no architectural remains of the old Hindu city of Lahore, a circumstance which might well be explained by the absence of stone material, and the numerous destructive invasions to which the city has been subjected. But also, in accordance with what all Indian architectural researchers tend to show namely, that the northern Hindus were not, until a comparatively late period, in the habit of building temples, or durable edifices of any kind. Even at Delhi, the seat of Hindu dynasties from upwards of a thousand years before CE to more than a thousand years after CE, and there, where is abundance of stone, no specimens of Hindu architecture exist dating earlier than the tenth or eleventh century.An evaluation of Lahore Style of Architecture  Early Muslim dynasties  At the period of the first Muslim conquests, Lahore was in possession of a Rajput King Prithviraj Chauhan, of the family of Ajmer. Whether owing to change of dynasty, or to Lahore's exposed position on the high road from Afghanistan to India, it was subsequently deserted and the seat of the government was removed to Sialkot or its vicinity, where it remained until the period of the conquests of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi in the beginning of the eleventh century; that the conqueror re-occupied the deserted city, and established a garrison in a fort, which was built possibly, like the Old Fort at Delhi, on the ruin of the old Rajput stronghold. In 682 AD, according to Ferishta, the Afghans of Peshawar, who had, even at that early period, embraced Islam, wrested certain possessions from the Hindu prince. A war ensued, and in the space seventy battles were fought with varied success, until the Afghans, having formed an alliance with the Ghakkars, a wild tribe inhabiting the Salt Range of Punjab, compelled the Raja to cede a portion of his territory. The next mention of Lahore is in the Rajputana chronicles, where the Bussas of Lahore, a Rajput tribe, are mentioned as rallying to the defence of Chittore, when besieged by Muslim forces in the beginning of the ninth century. Image of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi in his court where noblemen and noblewomen convened. Sultan Qutub ud Din Aibak in Anarkali, Lahore, Pakistan. At length, in 975 AD, Sultan Sabuktigin, Governor of Khorassan and father of the celebrated Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi advanced beyond the Indus. He was met by Raja Jayapala, the Raja of Lahore whose dominion is said to have extended from Sirhind to Laghman and from Kashmir to Multan. By the advice of the Bhati Rajput tribe, the Raja Jayapala formed an alliance with the Afghans, and, with their aid, was enabled to withstand the first invasion. However, Sabuktigin later repeated his conquest on his succession to the throne of Ghazni. A battle ensued in the vicinity of Lamghan ending with the defeat of the Raja and overtures being made for peace. His terms were accepted and persons were sent, on the part of Sabuktigin, to take the balance of the stipulated ransom. On reaching Lahore, Jayapala proved faithless and imprisoned those commissioned to receive the treasure. On learning intelligence of his perfidy, Sabuktigin, in the words of the Ferishta, \\"like a foaming torrent, hastened towards Hindustan\\". Another battles ensued, in which Jaipal was again vanquished, and he retreated, leaving the territory to the west of the Nilab or Indus in the hands of the invader. The invader did not retain the conquests that he had made for in 1008 AD, a confederation headed by Anandapala, the son of Raja Jayapala, again met the advancing army, now commanded by Mahmud, son and successor of Sabaktagin, in the vicinity of Peshawar. Lahore was allowed to remain intact for thirteen years longer. Anandapala was succeeded by Nardjanpal, while Mahmud pushed his conquests into Hindustan. But in 1022 AD, he suddenly marched down from Kashmir, seized Lahore without opposition, and gave it over to be plundered. Nardjanpal fled helpless to Ajmer, and the Hindu principality of Lahore was extinguished forever. A final effort was made by the Hindus in the reign of Modud, 1045 AD, to recover their lost sovereignty, but after a fruitless siege of six months, they retired without success. Mahmud and Ayaz Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi is to the right, shaking the hand of the Shaikh, with Ayaz standing behind him. The figure to his right is Shah Abbas I, who reigned about 600 years later. Few references to Lahore exist for times before its capture by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi in the eleventh century. In 1021, Mahmud appointed Malik Ayaz to the throne and made Lahore the capital of the Ghaznavid Empire. The Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi took Lahore after a long siege and battle in which the city was torched and depopulated. As the first Muslim ruler of Lahore, Ayaz rebuilt and repopulated the city. The present Lahore Fort stands in the same location. Under his rule, the city became a cultural and academic center, renowned for poetry. The tomb of Malik Ayaz can still be seen in the Rang Mahal commercial area of town. After the fall of the Ghaznavid Empire, Lahore was ruled by various Muslim dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate, including the Khaljis, Tughlaqs, Sayyid, Lodhis and Suris. When Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aybak was crowned here in 1206, he became the first Muslim Sultan of South Asia.India The early Turkish sultans It was not until 1524 that Lahore became part of the Mughal Empire. = Mongol invasion and destruction = The Mongols invaded and conquered the Khwarazmian dynasty, the King Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu retreated to modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but was defeated in Battle of Indus.Why ‚Äòscourge of god‚Äô ransacked Lahore every six years The Mongol army advanced and in 1241, the ancient city of Lahore was invaded by 30,000-man cavalry.

In 1298, 200,000 men Mongol army conquered Punjab and committed atrocities then marched towards Delhi but was defeated by Malik Kafur general of Sultan Alauddin Khalji ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. = Fall of the Sultanate = The last Lodi ruler, Sultan Ibrahim Lodi was greatly disliked by his court and subjects. Upon the death of his father Sultan Sikandar Lodi, he quashed a brief rebellion led by some of his nobles who wanted his younger brother Jalal Khan to be the Sultan. After seizing the throne by having Jalal Khan murdered, he never really did succeed in pacifying his nobles. Subsequently, Daulat Khan, the governor of Punjab and Alam Khan, his uncle, sent an invitation to Babur, the ruler of Kabul to invade Delhi. The first Battle of Panipat (April 1526) was fought between the forces of Babur and the Delhi Sultanate. Ibrahim Lodi was killed on the battlefield. By way of superior generalship, vast experience in warfare, effective strategy, and appropriate use of artillery, Babur won the First battle of Panipat and subsequently occupied Agra and Delhi.

Lahore touched the zenith of its glory during the Mughal rule from 1524 to 1752. The Mughals, who were famous as builders, gave Lahore some of its finest architectural monuments, many of which are extant today. Emperor Aurangzeb seated on a golden throne holding a hawk in the Durbar. From 1524 to 1752, Lahore was part of the Mughal Empire. Lahore grew under emperor Babur; from 1584 to 1598, under the emperors Akbar the Great and Jahangir, the city served as the empire's capital. Lahore reached the peak of its architectural glory during the rule of the Mughals, many of whose buildings and gardens have survived the ravages of time. Lahore's reputation for beauty fascinated the English poet John Milton, who wrote \\"Agra and Lahore, the Seat of the Great Mughal\\" in 1670. During this time, the massive Lahore Fort was built. A few buildings within the fort were added by Akbar's son, Mughal emperor Jahangir, who is buried in the city. Jahangir's son, Shahjahan Burki, was born in Lahore. He, like his father, extended the Lahore Fort and built many other structures in the city, including the Shalimar Gardens. The last of the great Mughals, Aurangzeb, who ruled from 1658 to 1707, built the city's most famous monuments, the Badshahi Masjid and the Alamgiri Gate next to the Lahore Fort. During the 18th century, as Mughal power dwindled, Lahore was often invaded, and government authority was lacking. The great Punjabi poet Baba Waris Shah said of the situation, \\"khada peeta wahy da, baqi Ahmad Shahy da\\" ‚Äî \\"we have nothing with us except what we eat and wear, all other things are for Ahmad Shah\\". Ahmad Shah Durrani captured remnants of the Mughal Empire and had consolidated control over the Punjab and Kashmir regions by 1761.For a detailed account of the battle fought, see Chapter VI of The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan by H.

Maratha Empire  Shortly after defeating the Afghans in the Battle of Delhi, the Marathas entered Lahore in 1758. In March 1758, about 50,000 soldiers of the Maratha Empire laid siege to Sirhind, with a usual alliance with Khalsa and Mughal Commander Khan Adina Beig. At that time, the Afghan general Jahan Khan, along with Abdali's son Taimur Shah, had 25,000 troops with him.

Bhangi Misl  Shortly after that, in 1761 A.D, As Marathas were defeated in Panipat and Ahmed Shah went back to Afghanistan a chaos resulted. Lack of local government and no head or ruler in the Punjab allowed Sikh Misls to gain effective control of their respective areas. From 1764 to 1799, Bhangis controlled the Lahore province. The latter part of the Bhangi rule is considered as very oppressive and unjust. In the end of 1798, The High Gentry of Lahore, comprising all three religions, made a combined and effective petition before, Ranjit Singh, the chief of Sukerchakia Misl to invade and take control of the Lahore province which he successfully did with the help of his mother-in-law, Sada Kaur's Kanhaiya Misl.  Sikh Empire  During the 18th century, as Mughal power dwindled, Lahore was often invaded by Afghan armies and became a province of the Afghan Empire, governed by provincial rulers with their own court. The Sikhs warring band invaded after the decline of the Mughal Empire in Punjab and created of a collection of autonomous Misls, which were governed by Misldars,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, (Edition: Volume V22, Date: 1910‚Äì1911), Page 892. mainly in the Punjab region. = Rebellion against the Mughal Empire = Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles.

The 1740s were years of chaos, and the city had nine different governors between 1745 and 1756. Invasions and chaos in local government allowed bands of warring Sikhs to occupy some areas. In 1799, all Sikh Misls (warring bands) joined into one to form a sovereign Sikh state ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh from the royal capital, Lahore. During the 1740s, frequent invasions by Afghans led by Ahmad Shah Abdali and has created chaos in local government had made life very uncomfortable for the citizens of Lahore. Bhangi Misl was the first Sikh band to invade and plunder the Mughal Lahore. Later Ranjit Singh was able to make gains in this chaos. He defeated the grandson of Abdali, Zaman Shah in a battle between Lahore and Amritsar. Out of the chaos of Afghan and Sikh conflicts Ranjit Singh who was able to unify the Sikh factions and capture Lahore where he was crowned Emperor. Many visitors to Lahore during this era noted that much of the city was in disrepair and many of its Muslim monuments and Mosques were pillaged and desecrated by the Sikhs.

On 7 July 1799, the Sikh militia of the Sukerchakia chief, Ranjit Singh, occupied Lahore. Ranjit Singh used the Hazuri Bagh, the enclosed garden next to the Mosque as his official royal court of audience. In 1762 A.D., the Bhangi Sikh Sardar army conquered Lahore and occupied the Shaheed Ganj Mosque, together with the courtyard.

Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organizing popular and material support for his Punjab campaign. He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers, traveling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims. In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Okara but with no decisive result. In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831, Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated and martyred by the professional Sikh Army. In 1841, during the Sikh civil war, Ranjit Singh's son, Sher Singh, used the Badshahi Mosque's large minarets for placement of zamburahs or light guns, which were placed atop the minarets of Badshahi Mosque to bombard the supporters of the Sikh Maharani Chand Kaur taking refuge in the besieged Lahore Fort, inflicting great damage to the Fort itself. In one of these bombardments, the Fort's Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was destroyed (it was subsequently rebuilt by the British but never regained its original architectural splendour).https://www.ualberta.ca/~rnoor/mosque_badshahi.html During this time, Henri De la Rouche, a French cavalry officer employed in the army of Sher Singh, used a tunnel connecting the Badshahi Mosque to the Lahore Fort to temporarily store gunpowder.  British Raj  Maharajah Ranjit Singh made Lahore his capital and was able to expand the kingdom to the Khyber Pass and also included Jammu and Kashmir, while keeping the British from expanding across the River Sutlej for more than 40 years. After his death in 1839 the internecine fighting between the Sikhs and several rapid forfeitures of territory by his sons, along with the intrigues of the Dogras and two Anglo- Sikh wars, eventually led to British control of the Lahore Darbar ten years later. Capitalizing on the disarray surrounding the succession struggles after Ranjit Singh's death and only partially diminished by a war fought against the Sikhs on their eastern frontier, the British rode into Lahore in February 1846 and garrisoned their troops in the citadel. Two unstable years later, they were drawn into a second war with the Sikhs at the southern city of Multan when that city's governor, Mul Raj, encouraged his troops to rebel. After a series of closely fought battles, the Sikh army was finally defeated in the Battle of Gujrat, sixty miles north of Lahore. In March 1848, following the British victory, Dalip Singh, Ranjit Singh's teenage son and heir to the throne, was formally deposed in Lahore. The remaining Sikh regiments in the city were abruptly decommissioned and camped outside the city demanding severance pay. Within a year, the Punjab was formally annexed to the British Empire and military sappers had begun leveling Lahore's city wall. For the British, Punjab was a frontier province, because Lahore had boundaries with Afghanistan. Therefore, the Punjabis, unlike the Bengalis and the Sindhis, were not allowed to use their mother tongue as an official language.

He was a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of Transnistria from 2000 until his election as president in 2011. Furthermore, he was speaker of Pridnestrovian Supreme Soviet from 2005 to 2009, and the leader of the political party Obnovlenie until 2010. Shevchuk is an ethnic Ukrainian and a citizen of both Transnistria and Russia.http://lenta.ru/lib/14164168/ Early life Yevgeny was born in Rybnitsa, Moldavian SSR, Soviet Union (now R√Æbni»õa, Transnistria, Moldova). He is a lawyer who has worked in government and private business. His biography profile describes him as \\"social democratic technocrat with a European outlook, and a man of profound democratic beliefs\\". Politics As part of the minority opposition in parliament prior to December 2005, he spearheaded a reform drive by his party to introduce changes to Transnistria's electoral code. Among the changes were a requirement that purely technical qualifications be used as the basis for selecting polling station chairmen and a rule prohibiting state-owned media outlets (radio, TV, newspapers, etc.) from publishing results of polls and forecasts related to elections, so as to not influence free voter choice. This was reported in the United States State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2005. In a 2005 report the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe referred to Shevchuk in the context of democratic reform, noting that Transnistria \\"is moving towards more pluralism\\" and highlighted \\"the Transnistrian parliament's own initiatives on the reform of the political system\\" which were spearheaded by Shevchuk's bloc. After that the European Parliament banned Shevchuk from entry to the EU countries.

(22 July 2009) Anatoliy Kaminski, who was vice-speaker under Shevchuk and is vice chairman of Shevchuk's Obnovlenie party, was the only nominee to succeed him. Mikhail Burla, leader of Obnovlenie and Chairman of the Committee for economic policy, budget and finance, was elected as the new vice-speaker. Shevchuk cited a controversial attempt to revise the county's constitution by president Igor Smirnov as the main reason for his resignation.Yevgeny Shevchuk, \\"I call on you all to unite to protect our future, where there is the rule of law, the strong people are just, the weak people are protected, and everyone works and maintains stability‚Äù.

The data it captures can be quantitative or qualitative. When the information is quantitative, the check sheet is sometimes called a tally sheet. The check sheet is one of the so-called Seven Basic Tools of Quality Control. Format The defining characteristic of a check sheet is that data are recorded by making marks (\\"checks\\") on it. A typical check sheet is divided into regions, and marks made in different regions have different significance. Data are read by observing the location and number of marks on the sheet. Check sheets typically employ a heading that answers the Five Ws: * Who filled out the check sheet * What was collected (what each check represents, an identifying batch or lot number) * Where the collection took place (facility, room, apparatus) * When the collection took place (hour, shift, day of the week) * Why the data were collected. Function Kaoru Ishikawa identified five uses for check sheets in quality control: * To check the shape of the probability distribution of a process * To quantify defects by type * To quantify defects by location * To quantify defects by cause (machine, worker) * To keep track of the completion of steps in a multistep procedure (in other words, as a checklist) =To assess the shape of a process's probability distribution= Frequency distribution constructed from a check sheet When assessing the probability distribution of a process one can record all process data and then wait to construct a frequency distribution at a later time. However, a check sheet can be used to construct the frequency distribution as the process is being observed. This type of check sheet consists of the following: * A grid that captures ** The histogram bins in one dimension ** The count or frequency of process observations in the corresponding bin in the other dimension * Lines that delineate the upper and lower specification limits Note that the extremes in process observations must be accurately predicted in advance of constructing the check sheet. When the process distribution is ready to be assessed, the assessor fills out the check sheet's heading and actively observes the process. Each time the process generates an output, he or she measures (or otherwise assesses) the output, determines the bin in which the measurement falls, and adds to that bin's check marks. When the observation period has concluded, the assessor should examine it as follows: * Do the check marks form a bell curve? Are values skewed? Is there more than one peak? Are there outliers? * Do the check marks fall completely within the specification limits with room to spare? Or are there a significant number of check marks that fall outside the specification limits? If there is evidence of non-normality or if the process is producing significant output near or beyond the specification limits, a process improvement effort to remove special-cause variation should be undertaken. =For defect type= A check sheet that tracks quantities of defects by type When a process has been identified as a candidate for improvement, it's important to know what types of defects occur in its outputs and their relative frequencies. This information serves as a guide for investigating and removing the sources of defects, starting with the most frequently occurring. This type of check sheet consists of the following: * A single column listing each defect category * One or more columns in which the observations for different machines, materials, methods, operators are to be recorded Note that the defect categories and how process outputs are to be placed into these categories must be agreed to and spelled out in advance of constructing the check sheet. Additionally, rules for recording the presence of defects of different types when observed for the same process output must be set down. When the process distribution is ready to be assessed, the assessor fills out the check sheet's heading and actively observes the process. Each time the process generates an output, he or she assesses the output for defects using the agreed-upon methods, determines the category in which the defect falls, and adds to that category's check marks. If no defects are found for a process output, no check mark is made. When the observation period has concluded, the assessor should generate a Pareto chart from the resulting data. This chart then determines the order in which the process is to be investigated and sources of variation that lead to defects removed. =For defect location= When process outputs are objects for which defects may be observed in varying locations (for example bubbles in laminated products or voids in castings), a defect concentration diagram is invaluable.Note that while most check sheet types aggregate observations from many process outputs, typically one defect location check sheet is used per process output. This type of check sheet consists of the following: * A to- scale diagram of the object from each of its sides, optionally partitioned into equally-sized sections When the process distribution is ready to be assessed, the assessor fills out the check sheet's heading and actively observes the process. Each time the process generates an output, he or she assesses the output for defects and marks the section of each view where each is found. If no defects are found for a process output, no check mark is made. When the observation period has concluded, the assessor should reexamine each check sheet and form a composite of the defect locations. Using his or her knowledge of the process in conjunction with the locations should reveal the source or sources of variation that produce the defects. =For defect cause= When a process has been identified as a candidate for improvement, effort may be required to try to identify the source of the defects by cause. This type of check sheet consists of the following: * One or more columns listing each suspected cause (for example machine, material, method, environment, operator) * One or more columns listing the period during which process outputs are to be observed (for example hour, shift, day) * One or more symbols to represent the different types of defects to be recorded‚Äîthese symbols take the place of the check marks of the other types of charts. Note that the defect categories and how process outputs are to be placed into these categories must be agreed to and spelled out in advance of constructing the check sheet. Additionally, rules for recording the presence of defects of different types when observed for the same process output must be set down. When the process distribution is ready to be assessed, the assessor fills out the check sheet's heading. For each combination of suspected causes, the assessor actively observes the process. Each time the process generates an output, he or she assesses the output for defects using the agreed-upon methods, determines the category in which the defect falls, and adds the symbol corresponding to that defect category to the cell in the grid corresponding to the combination of suspected causes. If no defects are found for a process output, no symbol is entered. When the observation period has concluded, the combinations of suspect causes with the most symbols should be investigated for the sources of variation that produce the defects of the type noted. Optionally, the cause-and-effect diagram may be used to provide a similar diagnostic. The assessor simply places a check mark next to the \\"twig\\" on the branch of the diagram corresponding to the suspected cause when he or she observes a defect. =Checklist= Example checklist While the check sheets discussed above are all for capturing and categorizing observations, the checklist is intended as a mistake-proofing aid when carrying out multi- step procedures, particularly during the checking and finishing of process outputs. This type of check sheet consists of the following: * An (optionally numbered) outline of the subtasks to be performed * Boxes or spaces in which check marks may be entered to indicate when the subtask has been completed Notations should be made in the order that the subtasks are actually completed. =Other types= Check sheets are not limited to those described above. Users should employ their imaginations to design check sheets tailored to the circumstances.

The encircling hills have the resounding names of Chiltan, Takatoo, Mordar and Zarghun. It is believed that the earliest Muslim inhabitants and rulers/owners of the city were the Pashtun Kasi Tribe. Quetta was first mentioned in the 11th century when it was captured by Mahmood of Ghazni on one of his invasions of the subcontinent. In 1543 the Mughal emperor Humayun rested here on his retreat to Persia, leaving his one-year-old son Akbar until he returned two years later. The Ghilzai power in Kandahar at the beginning of the eighteenth century, simultaneously with that of the Baloch in Kalat, Quetta and Pishin became the battle-ground between the Afghans and Baloch in the region. Ahmed Shah Durrani finally handed Quetta over to the Khan of Kalat Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch for helping him with his army in 1751 against the Marathas in the Battle of Panipat (1761), and against the Sikhs in 1765. Today, it is an important city in Pakistan. Quetta has more than 50% pashtoon population mainly Kasi & Kakar/sub tribes and other pashtoon tribes as well.... History Ancient empires The earliest evidence of human occupation in what is now Quetta and Pakistani Balochistan is dated to the Paleolithic era, represented by hunting camps and lithic scatters (chipped and flaked stone tools). The earliest settled villages in the region date to the ceramic Neolithic (c. 7000‚Äì6000 BCE), and included the site of Mehrgarh (located in the Kachi Plain). These villages expanded in size during the subsequent Chalcolithic, when interaction was amplified. This involved the movement of finished goods and raw materials, including chank shell, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and ceramics. By 2500 BCE (the Bronze Age), the region now known as Pakistani Balochistan had become part of the Harappan cultural orbit, providing key resources to the expansive settlements of the Indus river basin to the east. The powerful Khans of Kalat held the fort from 1512. In 1828 the first westerner to visit Quetta described it as a mud-walled fort surrounded by 300 mud houses. Although occupied briefly by the British during the First Afghan War in 1839, it was not until 1876 that Quetta came under full British control and Robert Sandeman was made political agent in Baluchistan. By the formation of political party of Muslims (Muslim league) Balochistan paid its contribution for the freedom of Pakistan. Qazi Muhammad Essa (a sunni Hazara) was the first man introduced Muslims political party in Balochistan, this struggle persisted until 1947. Following the independence of Pakistan, Balochistan joined Pakistan and Quetta became the capital of Balochistan. The word Quetta is derived from a Pashto word (kwa ta), which means inside the mountains or among the mountains.

In September 2013, the camp was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1943, prisoners Otto Kretschmer and Wolfgang Heyda were the subject of an elaborate escape attempt named Operation Kiebitz. Early history (Bowmanville Boys Training School). Two of the early buildings were completed in 1927. The property taught boys until 1941, 14 years after it first opened as a school, when the government told the school to move to a new location so the area could be quickly turned into a prisoner of war (P.O.W) camp. Bowmanville Boys Training School were relocated within Bowmanville to \\"Rathskamoray\\" (Currently the Lion's Centre), although most boys returned home. Canadian officials had barely seven months to turn the boys school into a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp. The school was built to hold many people, but the officials had many tasks to complete before prisoners could be moved in: building barb-wire fences 15 feet apart, guard towers (nine), as well as gates and barracks for the Canadian guards. These tasks were completed in late 1941, just as the prisoners were arriving. After the war ended, the POWs were shipped back to Europe, and the site resumed its use as a school. Battle of Bowmanville Cafeteria and site of \\"Battle of Bowmanville\\", c. 1930 In October 1942, between 1,500 and 4,000 prisoners revolted against the POW guards after they were shackled as retribution as part of the escalation of Germany's new Commando Order. Lieutenant-colonel James Taylor had asked German senior officer Georg Friemel to supply 100 prisoners to volunteer to be shackled as part of the ongoing international dispute. When he refused, Otto Kretschmer and Hans Hefele were also asked to provide volunteers, but refused. Taylor ordered the guards to find 100 officers to be shackled by force, and Horst Elfe, Kretschmer and others barricaded themselves in the mess hall, arming themselves with sticks, iron bars and other makeshift weapons. Approximately 100 Canadian soldiers requisitioned from another base in Kingston arrived, and together stormed the mess hall using only ice hockey sticks, so the two sides remained evenly matched. After several hours of brawling, the Canadians brought high pressure water hoses and soaked the cabin thoroughly until the prisoners agreed to come out peacefully. During later incidents in the battle which spanned several days, Volkmar K√∂nig was wounded by gunfire and another prisoner was bayoneted, and a Canadian soldier suffered a skull fracture from a thrown jar of jam. After calm had returned, 126 of the prisoners were transferred to other camps. Escape attempts During the years the site was used as a prisoner of war camp, there were many escape attempts; even though it was said the prisoners were treated better than most citizens of Bowmanville and the surrounding area. *The first escape came shortly after the camp opened on November 23, 1941. Ulrich Steinhilper escaped through the wire and was on the run for two days before being recaptured. He would escape again a few weeks later and be recaptured again. His last attempt was February 18, 1942. After recapture he was moved to Camp 20. *November 25, 1941. A prisoner attempted to crawl underneath the barbed wire, but was caught immediately and given a 28-day detention. *Operation Kiebitz - failed escape attempt to rescue four German submarine commanders. *On December the 30th, a prisoner attempted an escape by hiding in the laundry truck as it was leaving the camp. The attempt failed, and he was held in the Oshawa Jail for a few hours before being released into the camp that same day. *During a routine inspection in the prisoner's cells, a tin can was found with a map and tools to escape, on the 29th of July, 1943. The can was taken and likely either locked away, or destroyed. *It is said the most notorious escape attempts were that in which the P.O.W's tried to build tunnels. Several were attempted, and when found were stopped and closed off. The most famous tunnel attempt was started in the North-east corner of Victoria Hall. (Referred to by prisoners as Haus IV) The tunnel was 50cmX50cm squared, lighting had been wired in, and a ventilation system installed using tin cans. Supports were every 1‚Äì2 meters and were made from wood from attics within the camp. The dirt excavated was disposed of using a trolley system, and men passing a bucket up to the attic through a hole in the ceiling. In September 1943 the attic floor collapsed from the weight of the accumulated dirt. Alerted guards discovered the tunnel and collapsed it. Present day The property remained as a boys training school until 1979 and various academic used until 2008 (school for overseas Malaysian students, St. Stephen's Catholic Secondary School and finally a private Islamic university). In present times, the P.O.W. Camp 30 is greatly neglected. Buildings are boarded up, doors are blocked by dirt, or are also boarded up. All windows are broken, and interiors of the buildings are badly damaged with graffiti covering the walls, and drywall smashed. Most are also considered dangerous or a fire hazard (there is fire damage within all of the biggest buildings), but some remain in fairly good condition, with minimal water damage. In 2013, Camp 30 received a spot on Heritage Canada's list for 'The top 10 endangered places of 2013' mainly because it was scheduled to be demolished, due to neglect of the buildings, and the value of the land to a developer. This demolition plan was cancelled later in 2013, after it was named a National Historic Site. Most agree that the site should be saved, but at the moment it is undecided what will be done with the property. \\"All we want to see is reuse of the buildings... some people want a big, beautiful museum, we understand the finances aren't there. We just want to see adaptive reuse\\" the president of ACO Clarington, Tracey Ali, said to the Clarington newspaper. The estimated amount to restore all buildings could go as high as $15,000,000. The Clarington paper also reports of how a committee was created September 9, 2013 to look at how the buildings can be saved, and how they will be preserved. A heritage plaque is expected to be put up, given its landmark designation. The site is currently in poor condition, vandalized, abandoned and neglected. Today the cafeteria is little more than a brick shell, although the building's original freezer remains intact. Also, the basement has the remains of two boilers. On July 5, 2016, the Municipality of Clarington announced that they had completed a purchase agreement with the current owners of the property, Kaitlin Developments and Fandor Homes. This move has effectively saved the site from eventual destruction by a combination of vandalism, inadequate funding, and eventual home development. The sale includes a $500,000 donation to the Municipality to assist in the maintenance and care of the property in conjunction with an initial site cleanup. The cleanup will involve destroying buildings that have not received a historical status, cleaning up graffiti, and the installation of security cameras. References Sources O'Meara, J. (2013, Sept).

Being among the most ancient cities of the region, Peshawar has for centuries been a center of trade between West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. Ancient Peshawar Peshawar was likely established as a village in the 5th-6th century BC within the cultural sphere of eastern ancient Persia. The region around Peshawar was known as Gandhara in Sanskrit, Hindko the language used by the Buddhist kingdoms which first ruled the area. The Gandhara region surrounding Peshawar found mention in the Parsi Zend Avesta as Vaƒìk…ôr…ôta, the seventh most beautiful place on earth created by Ahura Mazda. It was known as the \\"crown jewel\\" of Bactria and also held sway over Takshashila (modern Taxila).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Gandhara The city would later be referred to by several names, including Parashawar as transcribed by Al-Masudi, Poshpura as found in a Kharosthi inscription, and Pskbvr as noted in the ancient Persian Shapur inscription. Popular theory suggests the city's name was Purushapura based on the writing of a 7th-century traveler, but the name Purushapura does not appear in any ancient literary sources. Various theories have been put forth to explain the city's name, based primarily on Sanskrit or Ancient Persian names. It later became the western capital of Gandhara Mahajanapada, after Pushkalavati. By the 2nd century BCE, Peshawar was a center of learning, as witnessed in the Bakhshali Manuscript, used in the Bakhshali approximation was found nearby. The region was annexed by the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Later, the region was invaded by Alexander the Great's army. The city passed into the rule of Alexander's successor, Seleucus I Nicator who ceded it to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya Empire. The inhabitants of Peshawar were mostly Hindu and Buddhist during this period. The fall of the Mauryans provided opportunities to the Indo-Greeks to establish their rule over the region. The Indo-Greek kings combined the Greek and Indian languages and symbols, as seen on their coins, and blended ancient Greek, Hindu and Buddhist religious practices, as seen in the archaeological remains of their cities and in the indications of their support of Buddhism, pointing to a rich fusion of Indian and Hellenistic influences.\\"A vast hoard of coins, with a mixture of Greek profiles and Indian symbols, along with interesting sculptures and some monumental remains from Taxila, Sirkap and Sirsukh, point to a rich fusion of Indian and Hellenistic influences\\", India, the Ancient Past, Burjor Avari, p.130 The diffusion of Indo-Greek culture had consequences which are still felt today, particularly through the influence of Greco-Buddhist art.Ghose, Sanujit (2011). \\"Cultural links between India and the Greco-Roman world\\" . Ancient History Encyclopedia. The Indo-Greeks ultimately disappeared at Peshawar as a political entity around 10 CE following the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, although pockets of Greek populations probably remained for several centuries longer under the subsequent rule of the Indo-Parthians and Kushans.\\"When the Greeks of Bactria and India lost their kingdom they were not all killed, nor did they return to Greece. They merged with the people of the area and worked for the new masters; contributing considerably to the culture and civilization in southern and central Asia.\\" Narain, \\"The Indo-Greeks\\" 2003, p.278 Kushan Peshawar The city was then conquered by the Kushan Empire. The Kushan Emperor Kanishka, who ruled from 127 CE, moved the capital from Pushkalavati (present-day Charsadda district, in the Peshawar Valley) to Gandhara (Peshawar city) in the 2nd century CE. Buddhist missionaries arrived at Vedic, and animist Peshawar, seeking counsel with the Kushan rulers. Their teachings were embraced by the Kushans, who converted to Buddhism, assigning the religion with great status in the city. Following this move by the Kushans, Peshawar became a center of Buddhist learning. The giant Kanishka stupa at Peshawar was built by King Kanishka to house Buddhist relics just outside the present-day Ganj Gate of the old city of Peshawar. The Kanishka stupa was said to be an imposing structure, as one traveled down from the Hindu Kush mountains onto the Gandharan plains. The earliest account of the famous building was documented by Faxian, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, who was also a monk, who visited the structure in 400 AD and described it as being over 40 chang in height (approximately ) and adorned \\"with all precious substances\\". Faxian continued: \\"Of all the st√ªpas and temples seen by the travelers, none can compare with this for beauty of form and strength.\\" The stupa was eventually destroyed by lightning, but was repaired several times; it was still in existence at the time of Xuanzang's visit in 634 AD. A jeweled casket containing relics of the Gautama Buddha, and an inscription identifying Kanishka as the donor, existed at the ruined base of this giant stupa ‚Äî the casket was excavated, by a team supervised by Dr D.B. Spooner in 1909, from a chamber under the very centre of the stupa's base. Hindu Shahis and Muslim conquest The Kabul Shahis ruled the Kabul Valley and Gandhara (modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) from the decline of the Buddhist Kushan Empire in the 3rd century to the early 9th century CE. The Shahis are generally split up into two eras: the earlier Buddhist Shahis and the later Hindu Shahis, with the change-over thought to have occurred sometime around 870 CE - after which Hinduism gained primacy in the region. The kingdom was known as the Kabul Shahan or Ratbelshahan from 565 CE to 670 CE, when the capitals were located in Kapisa and Kabul, and later Udabhandapura, also known as Hund,Sehrai, Fidaullah (1979).

But in the Panjab they consolidated their kingdom and established a new capital first at Hund. The Hindu Shahis under Jayapala, is known for his struggles in defending his kingdom against the Ghaznavids in the modern-day eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan region. Jayapala saw a danger in the consolidation of the Ghaznavids and invaded their capital city of Ghazni both in the reign of Sebuktigin and in that of his son Mahmud, which initiated the Muslim Ghaznavid and Hindu Shahi struggles. Sebuk Tigin, however, defeated him, and he was forced to pay an indemnity. Jayapala defaulted on the payment and took to the battlefield once more. Jayapala, however, lost control of the entire region between the Kabul Valley and Indus River. After the Ghaznavid victory, the Buddhist, Hindu, and Zoroastrian natives began converting to Islam following the early annexation by the Arab Empire from Khurasan (in what is Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran). Amb Hindu Temple complex was built between the 7th and 9th centuries CE during the reign of the Hindu Shahi Empire. Before Jayapala's struggle began, he had raised a large army of Punjabi Hindus. When Jayapala went to the Punjab region, his army was raised to 100,000 horsemen and an innumerable host of foot soldiers. According to Ferishta: However, the army was hopeless in battle against the western forces, particularly against the young Mahmud of Ghazni. In the year 1001, soon after Sultan Mahmud came to power and was occupied with the Qarakhanids north of the Hindu Kush, Jayapala attacked Ghazni once more and upon suffering yet another defeat by the powerful Ghaznavid forces, near present-day Peshawar. After the Battle of Peshawar, he committed suicide because his subjects thought he had brought disaster and disgrace to the Shahis. Jayapala was succeeded by his son Anandapala, who along with other succeeding generations of the Shahis took part in various unsuccessful campaigns against the advancing Ghaznavids but were unsuccessful. The Hindu rulers eventually exiled themselves to the Kashmir Siwalik Hills. Mahmud punished the Pashtuns, who had sided with the Hindus, and, as they converted entirely to Islam, the Pashtuns remained loyal to their new allegiance.Gazetteer of the Peshawar District 1897‚Äì98 Pashtun and Mughal rule (1451‚Äì1758) Peshawar was a northwestern regional center of the Pashtun Lodi Empire which was founded by Bahlul Lodi in 1451 and centered at Delhi. Peshawar was also incorporated into the Mughal domains by the mid of 16th century. The founder of the Mughul dynasty that would conquer South Asia, Babur, who hailed from the area that is currently Uzbekistan, arrived in Peshawar and founded a city called Bagram, where he rebuilt a fort in 1530 AD. The Pashtun emperor Sher Shah Suri, who founded the Sur Empire centered at Delhi, turned Peshawar's renaissance into a boom when he ran his Delhi-to- Kabul Shahi Road as a northwestern extension of the Grand Trunk Road through the Khyber Pass and Peshawar in the 16th century. Later Babur's grandson, Akbar the Great, recorded the name of the city as Peshawa, meaning \\"The Place at the Frontier\\" or \\"Near Water\\" and expanded the bazaars and fortifications. The Muslim technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, teachers, theologians and Sufis flocked from the rest of the Muslim world to the Islamic Sultanate in South Asia, with many settling in the Peshawar region.Caroe, Olaf (1957) The Pathans. Khushal Khattak, the Pashtun warrior poet, was born near Peshawar, and his life was intimately tied to the city. As an advocate for Afghan independence, he was an implacable foe of the Mughal rulers, especially Aurangzeb. Durrani Peshawar (1747‚Äì1823) In December 1747, Peshawar joined the Pashtun Durrani Empire of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who used the Bala Hissar fort in Peshawar as his royal residence. In 1776, Ahmad Shah's son, Timur Shah Durrani, chose Peshawar as his winter capital. Up to the early 19th century, Peshawar was the winter capital of the Afghan Empire, and the Bala Hissar forn was the royal residence of Afghan kings. Pashtuns from Peshawar participated in the incursions of South Asia during the Durrani Empire. Peshawar remained under Durrani rule till the Sikhs captured Peshawar in March 1823. =Maratha attack (1758-1759)= During the Afghan rule, Peshawar was attacked and captured by the Maratha Empire of western India, which conquered Peshawar on 8 May 1758. A large force of Pashtuns under Ahmad Shah Durrani then re-conquered Peshawar in early 1759.Schofield, Victoria, \\"Afghan Frontier: Feuding and Fighting in Central Asia\\", London: Tauris Parke Paperbacks (2003), page 47 Sikh conquest (1823‚Äì1846) Until 1823, Peshawar was controlled by Afghanistan, but was invaded by the Sikh Empire of Punjab. The arrival of a party led by British explorer and former agent of the East India Company, William Moorcroft was seen as an advantage, both in dealings with Kabul and for protection against the Sikhs of Lahore. Moorcroft continued to Kabul in the company of Peshawari horses and thence to the Hindu Kush. In 1823, Peshawar was captured by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and paid a nominal tribute until it was finally annexed in 1834 by the Sikhs, after which the city fell into steep decline. Many of Peshawar's famous Mosques and gardens were destroyed by the Sikhs at this time. An Italian was appointed by the Sikhs as administrator. Acting on behalf of the Sikhs, Paolo Avitabile, unleashed a reign of fear ‚Äì his time in Peshawar is known as a time of \\"gallows and gibbets.\\" The city's famous Mahabat Khan, built in 1630 in the Jeweler's Bazaar, was badly damaged and desecrated by the Sikh conquerors. The Gurdwara Bhai Joga Singh and Gurdwara Bhai Beeba Singh were constructed in the city by Hari Singh Nalwa to accommodate the influx of Sikh immigrants from the Punjab. While the city's Sikh population drastically declined after the partition of India, Peshawar's Sikh community has re-established itself, bolstered by Sikh refugees and by approximately 4,000 refugees from the Tribal Areas; in 2008, the largest Sikh population in Pakistan was located in Peshawar. Sikhs in Peshawar self- identify as Pashtuns and speak Hindko and Pashto as their mother tongues. =Afghan attempts to reconquer Peshawar= An 1835 attempt to re-occupy the city by the Afghan Emir Dost Mohammad Barakzai failed when his army declined to engage in combat with the Dal Khalsa. However Barakzai's son, Wazir Akbar Khan, succeeded in regaining control of the city in the Battle of Jamrud of 1837. Following this, Peshawar was annexed by the British East India Company after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1845-46. British Empire (1846‚Äì1947) Following the defeat of the Sikh's in the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1845-46, territories in the Punjab were also captured by British East India company. During the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the 40,000 members of the native garrison were disarmed without bloodshed; the absence of brutality meant that Peshawar was not affected by the widespread devastation that was experienced throughout the rest of British India and local chieftains sided with the British after the incident.Charles Allen, Soldier Sahibs, p.276 British control remained confined within the city walls as vast regions of the Frontier province outside the city were claimed by the Kingdom of Afghanistan. The vast mountainous areas outside of the city were mapped out only in 1893 by Sir Mortimer Durand, foreign secretary of the British Indian government, who collaboratively demarcated the boundary of British-controlled areas with the Afghan ruler at the time, Abdur Rahman Khan. The British laid out the vast Peshawar Cantonment to the west of the city in 1868, and made the city its frontier headquarters. Additionally, several projects were initiated in Peshawar, including linkage of the city by railway to the rest of British India and renovation of the Mohabbat Khan mosque that had been desecrated by the Sikhs. The British also constructed Cunningham clock tower, in celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, and, in 1906, constructed Victoria Hall (now home of the Peshawar Museum) in memory of Queen Victoria. The British greatly contributed to the establishment of Western-style education in Peshawar with the establishment of Edwardes College and Islamia College in 1901 and 1913, respectively‚Äîthese were established in addition to numerous other schools, many of which are run by the Anglican Church. For better administration of the region, Peshawar and the adjoining districts were separated from the Punjab Province in 1901.Changes in the Socio-economic Structures in Rural North-West Pakistan By Mohammad Asif Khan Peshawar was separated from Punjab Province in 1901 Peshawar emerged as a centre for both Hindko and Pashtun intellectuals. Hindko speakers, also referred to as Khaarian (\\"city dwellers\\" in Pashto), were responsible for the dominant culture for most of the time that Peshawar was under British rule.The Frontier Town of Peshawar. A Brief History by Sayed Amjad Hussain. Whereas before it was the Pashtuns and Mughals who beautified and brought culture to the region, until the Sikhs brought the city to shambles and deterioration. Peshawar was the scene of a non-violent resistance movement that was led by Ghaffar Khan, a disciple of Mohandas Gandhi. In April 1930, Khan led a large group of locals, in a peaceful protest in Qissa Khawani Bazaar, against discriminatory laws that had been enacted by the British rulers ‚Äî hundreds were killed when British horses opened fire on the demonstrators. Post-independence history After the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1979 Peshawar served as a political centre for anti-Soviet Mujahideen, and was surrounded by huge camps of Afghan refugees. Many of the refugees remained there through the civil war which broke out after the Soviets were defeated in 1989, the rule of the Taliban, and the invasion by allied forces in late 2001. Peshawar would replace Kabul and Qandahar as the centre of Pakhtun cultural development during this tumultuous period. Additionally, Peshawar managed to assimilate many of the Pakhtun Afghan refugees with relative ease, while many other Afghan refugees remained in camps awaiting a possible return to Afghanistan. Peshawar continues to be a city that links Pakistan to Afghanistan and has emerged as an important regional city in Pakistan and remains a focal point for Pakhtun culture.

Shot in black-and-white, it runs for more than seven hours. It is based on the 1985 novel Satantango by Hungarian novelist L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai, who had been providing Tarr with stories since his 1988 film Damnation. Tarr had wanted to make the film since 1985 but was unable to proceed with the production due to the strict political environment in Hungary. In the years since its release, S√°t√°ntang√≥ has received wide acclaim from film critics, and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. In 2012, it appeared in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' top 50 films. Plot In a desolate village, after the collapse of a collective farm, Futaki is having an affair with Mrs. Schmidt (√âva Alm√°ssy Albert), as he is awakened at dawn by the ringing of church bells. Mr. Schmidt (L√°szl√≥ Lugossy) conspires with another co-worker to steal the villagers' money and flee to another part of the country. As Futaki is sneaking out of the Schmidt home, he discovers Schmidt's plans, after which he demands to become part of the scheme‚Äîall of this being watched by a lonely drunk man known as the Doctor (Peter Berling), who writes the events down in a notebook. However, the conspiracy is terminated when rumors spread across the village that the charismatic and manipulative Irimi√°s (Mih√°ly Vig), a former co-worker who had been presumed dead, is returning. Meanwhile, Irimi√°s and his friend Petrina (Putyi Horv√°th) make a secret deal with a Police Captain in a nearby city, to spy on the community. At the village, the Doctor discovers he has run out of fruit brandy. Unaccustomed to abandoning his house, he decides to go out to buy liquor nonetheless. Outside, he is met with hostile weather and the arrival of the night. After purchasing his brandy, he is approached by Estike (Erika B√≥k), a young girl who desperately reaches out for his help. Behaving aggressively towards the child, the Doctor reconsiders and naively tries to apologize as the girl leaves and disappears in the darkness. Chasing after her, the Doctor passes out, and collapses in nearby woods, and is found in the morning by the town's conductor who takes him to a hospital. The morning before the Doctor left his house, Estike is tricked by her brother, Sanyi (Andr√°s Bodn√°r), into planting a \\"money tree\\" somewhere in the wasteland. She tortures and poisons her cat to demonstrate that she has some control over something in her life. After finding out she has been deceived by her brother and trying in vain to recover her money, she succumbs to silent despair, devastated by what she's done to her pet. Dangerously marauding in the woods, the girl approaches the local bar, and peers through its window, where most of the villagers dance to accordion music, unaware of the child's voyeurism. Afterwards, she encounters the Doctor and cries out for his help to save her cat. Rebuffed, she retreats into an abandoned ruin and poisons herself. The following day, Irimi√°s arrives at the village while Estike's funeral is being held. Filled with grief, Irimi√°s speaks to the villagers hatefully and convinces them of handing him the money of their proposed venture in order to start a new collective farm in another city. The villagers travel together to a distant abandoned building, where they collapse into sleep and have intense nightmares. Meanwhile, Irimi√°s and Petrina meet with an accomplice in a nearby city to acquire explosives, for reasons never explicitly explained. The next day, Irimi√°s tells the villagers that the plan to establish a new farm has been delayed and that their only hope of establishing a farm is to scatter around the country for an unspecified amount of time. Schmidt and Kr√°ner (J√°nos Derzsi) demand Irimi√°s return their money. Irimi√°s agrees, but upon expressing his disapproval at their lack of trust, the villagers shamefully return the money. After traveling in a truck to the city, each of the villagers is assigned a different task by Irimi√°s and dismissed, except for Futaki, who tells Irimi√°s that he would rather get a job as a watchman, and leaves on his own. Government officials receive Irimi√°s' report detailing the villagers' descriptions, abilities and defects, and decide to re-write it in a more bureaucratically friendly way before filing it away and leaving for home. The Doctor returns home several weeks later, unaware that Irimi√°s had taken the entire community with him. As he sits down to write some notes, the same bells that woke Futaki up start ringing. The Doctor decides to leave his house once more to investigate the ruined church where the closest bell is heard. He discovers a madman in the middle of ruins desperately ringing the bells and shouting that Turks are coming. Frightened, the Doctor returns home, muttering nihilistic thoughts. The bells keep on ringing as he covers his windows with boards, completely submerging himself in darkness as he writes the narration that began the film.

The film is broken into twelve parts, and does not necessarily move chronologically, as it follows the tango scheme of going six moves forward, then six back (hence 6 + 6 parts in total). The twelve parts are titled as follows (in original Hungarian and translation): * A h√≠r, hogy j√∂nnek [The News Is They Are Coming] * Felt√°madunk [We Are Resurrected] * Valamit tudni [Knowing Something] * A p√≥k dolga I. [The Job of the Spider I] * Felfesl≈ëk [Unraveling] * A p√≥k dolga II (√ñrd√∂gcsecs, s√°t√°ntang√≥) [The Job of the Spider II (The Devil's Tit, Satan's Tango)] * Irimi√°s besz√©det mond [Irimi√°s Gives A Speech] * A t√°vlat, ha szemb≈ël [The Perspective From the Front] * Mennybe menni? L√°z√°lmodni? [Going to Heaven? Having Nightmares?] * A t√°vlat, ha h√°tulr√≥l [The Perspective From The Rear] * Csak a gond, a munka [Just Trouble and Work] * A k√∂r bez√°rul [The Circle Closes] =Long takes= The film is composed of long takes, a trait found in Tarr's work. Tarr's adoption of this style has led many people to draw parallels between Tarr and Andrei Tarkovsky, both of whom opted to let their films play out at a more meditative pace. According to Tarr himself, there are roughly only 150 shots in the entire film. Many shots last up to nearly 10‚Äì11 minutes, such as several dance sequences, during which the camera rarely moves, but we see the main characters dance and drink. Tarr has said that the cast was actually drunk during these scenes. The opening shot, in which the camera tracks alongside a herd of cows, lasts nearly 8 minutes. There are shots depicting main characters walking (and talking) for minutes at a time, unimpeded by a cut. =The book and the film= This film is based on literary sources and had a screenplay, but much of it was still improvised on set. Tarr had this to say on the subject of having a screenplay, but on his filming method in general: An omniscient narrator can be heard at several points throughout the film, textually quoting parts of the novel. It also adapts every single one of the moments in the book, leaving nothing out. =Music= Mih√°ly V√≠g, who plays Irimi√°s in the film, was B√©la Tarr's film composer since working on Almanac of Fall in 1984, until the director's retirement in 2011 with the film The Turin Horse. Tarr has described his collaboration with V√≠g, as well as that with his wife and editor √Ågnes Hranitzky and cinematographer Fred Kelemen, as \\"collaborative filmmaking\\", in which each one of their individual works stands as a relevant production of its own. As with Damnation (1987) and all of Tarr's work since 1994, S√°t√°ntang√≥ utilizes a small set of original compositions by V√≠g that play at strategic points of the film, to establish connections between themes or situations.‚Äî B√©la Tarr, Fred Kelemen and Mihaly V√≠g, by Michael Guarneri For S√°t√°ntang√≥, V√≠g composed a type of score that has been described as \\"carnivalesque\\" by Tim Brayton.‚Äî Tarr B√©la Dances with the Devil, by Tim Brayton It is composed of melancholic and haunting accordion themes, reminiscent of a slow and repetitive tango. The most prominent musical theme of the film is \\"Rain II\\", which is featured at most of the film's signature moments. Three tango suites play once at separate moments of the film, \\"Galicia\\" and \\"May I Have This Tango?\\" in \\"The Job of the Spider II\\"‚Äîwhile the villagers feast as Estike watches from outside the bar‚Äîand \\"Circle Dance II\\" after the villagers arrive at the new building that is supposed to be their farm, while the camera goes through their faces and emotions. Additionally, a sound effect-like deafening tune is used as the background for the ringing of the church bells, playing constantly throughout the film. In the 2009 compilation \\"Music From the Films of B√©la Tarr\\", all of the mentioned tracks appear, and the latter is listed as \\"Bell I\\" and \\"Bell II.\\"[ http://www.discogs.com/Mih%C3%A1ly-V%C3%ADg-Film-Music-From-The-Films- Of-B%C3%A9la-Tarr/release/5874859 ‚Äî Music From the Films of B√©la Tarr CD] Themes As with the novel upon which it is based, S√°t√°ntang√≥ deals with strong pessimistic philosophical themes surrounding the absence of authority, the prevalence of nihilism, and the evils of indifference. The opening shot, lasting up to 10 minutes, depicts a vast herd of cows wandering in a desolate farm and then vanishing in the distance. Although the scene is largely seen as an establishment of the area and the farm's ambiance, it is often discussed that it symbolizes the outcome of the story. In the chapter \\"We Are Resurrected\\", Irimi√°s and Petrina broker a deal with a Captain that will lead to the inevitable death or imprisonment of the villagers. The Captain does not appear to be comfortable with the lack of empathy and sociopathic conduct of Irimi√°s. For this reason, the Captain delivers an extended monologue about the importance of authority, quoting Pericles on the subjects of order and freedom. Some authors have judged the figure of the captain to represent a symbol of authoritarianism during the Hungarian People's Republic. Regarding the film's most prominent theme, the character of Irimi√°s can be seen wielding a God-like influence over the villagers to the point of convincing them of doing anything and to make himself be greatly feared by them. In \\"The News is They Are Coming\\", Futaki and Mr. Schmidt are forced to cut off their plans to escape with the money of the village's farm as a result of Mrs. Kr√°ner telling them of the discovery of Irimi√°s' return. Futaki is seen reflecting on the character of Irimi√°s with great fear, saying at one point \\"Irimi√°s [...] he could build a castle out of thin air, if that was his will.\\" The divine influence of Irimi√°s is symbolized heavily throughout the film. In \\"Knowing Something\\", the Doctor catches a glimpse of Irimi√°s and his companions' arrival before he blacks out in the forest. In the three middle chapters, concerning Estike's death, the villagers burst into an impromptu feast at the tavern in fear of the approaching moment of Irimi√°s' arrival. Precisely because of their fright of him, as well as their inherent mistrust of their neighbours, they ignore Estike in the woods outside as she first watches from a window, proceeds to cry to the Doctor for help and subsequently kills herself. Further on, Irimi√°s makes use of his rhetoric to persuade the villagers to hand him all of the money they had earned at the collective farm, pledging them the guilt of Estike's death. In many scenes, Irimi√°s appears as a knowledgeable and worldly person capable of manipulating the villagers, but also fearful of people less naive, such as the Captain and, to an extent, Futaki. Repressed fear of true authority from Irimi√°s can also be seen in \\"Going to Heaven? Having Nightmares?\\", when he encounters the ruins where Estike committed suicide. While he is ignorant of the event that took place in the ruins, Irimi√°s nonetheless bows before them, almost instinctively, as an acknowledgement. The fact that the villagers are aware that they have lost all prospects of stability, but are still willing to follow Irimi√°s due to his leadership, place him in the position of an archetypical False Prophet, with more diabolical traits to him than properly divine ones. Similarly, the character of the Doctor wields an important symbolic side of the film's themes. Appearing as man of culture and developed interests, the old Doctor is past the point of disillusion of his village, staying indoors most of the time and behaving antisocially. The Doctor only agrees to go out after finding out he has run out of brandy, and his choice is deeply regretted when he is met with hostile weather under the cover of darkness and collapses. In \\"The Perspective From the Front\\", the villagers remember they have left the Doctor in the desolate village‚Äîalthough he was in the hospital‚Äîand Futaki's suggestion is that they leave him behind \\"to starve.\\" The Doctor seems to be deprived of the villagers' indifference, in spite of his hostile behavior towards Mrs. Kr√°ner, willing to help Estike before she committed suicide and disturbed enough to investigate the ringing of the bells in \\"The Circle Closes.\\" Out of the entirety of the village's inhabitants, the Doctor seems to be the only one willing to accept death, as he chooses to starve himself in the abandoned village rather than following Irimi√°s. Reception S√°t√°ntang√≥ has garnered virtually unanimous acclaim from critics since its 1994 release, and grew in reputation among American art house circles following the release of the director-approved 2006 DVD from Facets Video. It currently has a 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. Tarr's direction has been a frequent subject of praise. Ed Halter called Tarr \\"one of filmdom's criminally undersung geniuses\\"; in referencing the film's ominous and illusory tones, Halter wrote, \\"Tarr's overwhelmingly bleak oeuvre makes Robert Bresson seem like an upbeat party animal by comparison.\\" Bela Tarr's Slow Burn In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis lauded the director's use of long takes. \\"Finding Beauty in the Miserable and the Mundane\\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice described it as \\"one of the great, largely unseeable movies of the last dozen years,\\" \\"Bela Tarr's Marathon Masterpiece Casts a Devilish Spell\\" and Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader has called the film his favorite of the 1990s. Jonathan Rosenbaum: 'Satantango'. Susan Sontag described S√°t√°ntang√≥ as \\"devastating, enthralling for every minute of its seven hours,\\" adding she would be \\"glad to see it every year for the rest of [her] life.\\" In the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made, the film tied for 36th place, with 34 critics having voted for it. Home video The film has developed a cult following among certain audiences, due in part to its artistry and length, but also to its having long been unavailable on DVD. The film was only briefly out in VHS and DVD formats in the 1990s, and went out of print very quickly, initiating a period in which only bootlegs transferred from old VHS sources were available. It has since been released in a new transfer supervised by Tarr. S√°t√°ntang√≥ is rarely screened in movie theaters due to its lengthy running time. Theaters generally show the film either in two separate parts, or in its entirety with two intermissions. Tarr has expressed a wish for the film to be viewed without any interruption. The scene in \\"Unraveling‚Äù when Estike (Erika B√≥k) kills her cat led to some difficulties in getting the film shown in the United Kingdom, due to legislation protecting animals from cruelty and the British Board of Film Classification refusing to certify such films. Tarr has insisted that there was a veterinarian on the set at all times, and that the cat was under the vet's supervision and was not killed.

Pinyan and Tait filmed and distributed zoophilic pornography of Pinyan receiving anal sex from a stallion under the alias \\"Mr. Hands\\". After engaging in this activity on multiple occasions over an unknown span of time, Pinyan received fatal internal injuries in one such incident. The story was reported in The Seattle Times and was one of that paper's most read stories of 2005. It was informally referred to as the \\"Enumclaw horse sex case\\". Pinyan's death rapidly prompted the passing of a bill in Washington prohibiting both sex with animals and the videotaping of such an act. Under current Washington law, bestiality is now a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Background In the 1970s, many statutes that had criminalized certain sex acts in various U.S. states were repealed, largely since they had criminalized some consensual sex acts between adults that were no longer considered appropriate to forbid (e.g., criminalizing all oral and anal sex). In Washington state, a law was repealed on July 1, 1976, that had said: An effect of the repeal was that bestiality became legal in the state of Washington. Kenneth Pinyan had worked for Boeing for eight years. He had previously been married to a woman and had children with her. He had moved from Seattle to Oak Harbor, Washington.Mudede, Charles. \\"Revisiting the Town of the Most Famous Horse Sex Death in Recorded History .\\" The Stranger. July 22, 2015. Retrieved on April 11, 2016. Before his death, Pinyan had been building a new house and a barn that he planned to keep a horse in, along the Key Peninsula Highway in Gig Harbor, Washington. He was about to begin making payments on the property's mortgage. Pinyan had previously lost the ability to experience certain sensations after a motorcycle accident, and he had begun to seek out increasingly extreme sexual acts ‚Äì such as insertion of extremely large dildos, fisting, and receptive anal sex with horses. In the early 2000s, he found a group of men online, nicknamed \\"zoos\\", who began meeting at a farm in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington, for communal weekends: they filmed one other being anally penetrated by horses, and sometimes engaged in sex with each other afterwards (which was also filmed). This was all later posted online. According to Charles Mudede, co-writer of the 2007 documentary film Zoo, the men trained the horses to penetrate them by stripping, applying a horse breeding pheromone, and bending over. In 2015, Mudede wrote that the men had a sexual fixation on large penises \\"that may have had nothing to do with horses.\\" He also believed Pinyan did not truly love horses and was not a true zoophile, although Pinyan had a cast created of the penis of his favorite horse, Strut. Pinyan's death The incident that killed Pinyan occurred at a farm, located in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington, \\"Tait, a truck driver who lives near the Southeast 444th Street farm where the death occurred, \\" five miles northwest of the city of Enumclaw. Sgt. John Urquhart of the Sheriff's Office said that \\"typically,\\" men were having sex with a horse on the property of James Michael Tait, a truck driver who lived in a trailer next to the farm, \\"but on this particular night it is my understanding that horse wasn't particularly receptive.\\" So Pinyan, Tait, and a third unidentified man snuck into the barn of the Southeast 444th Street farm that night. The men would often visit that farm for sexual purposes. Either Pinyan or the unidentified man recorded Tait being anally penetrated by a stallion known as Big Dick. After finishing, Tait then filmed Pinyan being anally penetrated by the same horse. During this incident, Pinyan sustained internal injuries including a perforated colon. Pinyan was anonymously dropped off at the Enumclaw Community Hospital. On July 2, 2005, a man asked hospital staff for medical assistance for his companion. Pinyan was found dead in the emergency room, aged 45. The man who brought Pinyan into the hospital had disappeared by the time hospital staff came to contact him. According to the Medical Examiner's Office, Pinyan \\"died of acute peritonitis due to perforation of the colon\\", and the death was ruled accidental. Investigation After Pinyan died, the authorities used his driver's license to find acquaintances and relatives. Earlier news reports stated that the authorities had used surveillance camera footage to track down Pinyan's companion. Using the contacts, the authorities found the farm where the incident occurred. The police tracked down the rural Enumclaw-area farm, which was known in zoophile chat rooms as a destination for people wanting to have sex with livestock, and seized 100 VHS tapes and DVDs, amounting to hundreds of hours of video of men engaging in bestiality. One of the videotapes featured Kenneth Pinyan shortly before he died on July 2. Prosecutors later determined that the horse had not been injured.Foundas, Scott. \\"Zoo.\\" Variety. Friday May 18, 2007. Retrieved on September 17, 2010. Media reporting Jennifer Sullivan, a Seattle Times staff reporter, said that originally the King County Sheriff's Department did not expect the newspaper to report on the event, because \\"it was too gruesome.\\" After an Associated Press report stated that the farm where the event occurred attracted \\"a significant number of people\\" who wanted to partake in bestiality, the Seattle Times decided that it needed to write articles about the case, since multiple people were involved. Criminal charges, guilty plea, and sentencing The videographer, 54-year- old James Michael Tait, was charged with criminal trespass in the first degree ‚Äì the owners of the farm, a third party, were not aware that the men had entered the property to engage in bestiality. The third man was not charged since he was not visible in the videos seized by investigators. On November 29, 2005, Tait entered an Alford plea, which is a form of guilty plea in which the accused maintains that they are factually innocent but acknowledges that the evidence would likely lead to conviction and thus accept being convicted.\\"Man in infamous Enumclaw horse-sex case faces new charges in Tennessee \\".

Judge David Christie gave him a suspended one- year sentence, a $300 fine, and one day of community service, and ordered Tait never to visit the farm again.

Two days later, an anonymous person e-mailed investigators a photo of a man having sex with a Shetland pony from Thomason's farm; Tait and Thomason were arrested that same day. Tait was charged with three counts of felony animal cruelty, while Thomason was charged with two. According to Tait's arrest warrant, he had been engaging in sex acts with a stud horse over a span of several months. Tait and Thomason admitted to engaging in sex acts with a horse. \\"James Tait, 58, was arrested and charged Thursday with three counts of felony animal cruelty in Maury County, Tenn.\\" In January 2010, Tait pleaded guilty in a Tennessee court to engaging in sexual acts with animals, and was placed on probation. \\"Tait, 58, pleaded guilty in January in Tennessee to engaging in sexual activity with animals and was released on probation.\\" =Section 16.52.205 of the Revised Code of Washington = After Pinyan died, Washington State Senator Pam Roach from Auburn crafted a bill to ban bestiality in Washington State.

His most recent UN assignment was as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. From 2015 to 2018 he was Executive Director of Security Council Report. Early life Martin was educated at Brentwood School in Brentwood, Essex and graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge with first class honours in history and economics. Afterwards, he was a graduate student in development economics at Harvard University for a year. From 1969 to 1972, Martin worked for the Ford Foundation in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. In 1971 while in Dhaka, East Pakistan, he witnessed the beginning of Bangladesh's War of Independence. After returning to the United Kingdom, Martin worked with the Redbridge Community Relations Council in London then served five years as the General Secretary of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants followed by three years as the General Secretary of the Fabian Society. He was a Labour Party Councillor in the London Borough of Redbridge 1978 to 1982. Amnesty International Martin's earlier work on the Indian subcontinent led to him become Head of the Asia Region in the Research Department of Amnesty International in 1985. On 1 October 1986, he became Secretary-General of Amnesty International, a post he held until October 1992. The number of members, supporters, and subscribers to the organization nearly doubled in size during Martin's tenure as Secretary-General. Martin headed Amnesty International missions to Israel and the Occupied Territories, Uganda, Bahrain, Kuwait, Republic of Korea, Argentina, Austria, Egypt, Bangladesh, Cuba, Philippines, Hungary, Mozambique, USSR, Syria, Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan, Yemen, Colombia, Peru, Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tunisia and India.Amnesty International Reports 1987-1993 The Human Rights Now! and A Conspiracy of Hope concert tours took place during Martin's leadership. Martin's resignation as Secretary-General of Amnesty International was discussed in Stephen Hopgood's 2006 book Keepers of the Flame: Understanding Amnesty International. According to Hopgood, Martin's decision was partially due to conflict with the chairman of Amnesty's International Executive Committee, Peter Duffy. After leaving AI, he became a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. United Nations Martin has held a number of senior positions with the United Nations and other international organizations. While working at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he was asked to serve as Director of Human Rights and Deputy Executive Director of the UN/OAS International Civilian Mission in Haiti. After leaving Haiti, Martin was named Chief of United Nations Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda from 1995 to 1996. Martin was appointed Special Adviser on Human Rights Field Operations to the High Commissioner on Human Rights in 1998, then Deputy High Representative for Human Rights in the Office of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1998 to 1999. During the United Nations Mission in East Timor that garnered worldwide attention in 1999, Martin served as Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for the East Timor Popular Consultation. From 2000 to 2001 he was appointed Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 2006, he served as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste. =Nepal= From 2005 to 2006, Martin led the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal. In October 2005, the government of King Gyanendra put in place a restrictive media ordinance which resulted in Martin's office releasing a statement decrying it as \\"violat[ing] international human rights standards\\". Martin also held the position of Personal Representative of the Secretary-General in Nepal for support to the peace process, 2006‚Äì2007, and Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of United Nations Mission in Nepal, 2006‚Äì2009. =Sri Lanka= During the Sri Lankan Civil War, Martin was appointed by the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as human rights adviser to the peace process and involved in peace talks. Talks were suspended in 2003 before the two parties approved an agreement on human rights drafted by Martin. =Gaza investigation and WikiLeaks= In 2009, Martin was appointed to head an independent United Nations Headquarters Board of Inquiry by Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon in order to investigate nine separate incidents during the 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza War involving deaths, injuries or damage at U.N. facilities. The Board's report, a summary of which was released on 5 May 2009, concluded that seven separate incidents were the result of firing by the Israeli Defence Forces, but found no evidence that U.N. facilities had been used to launch attacks against the IDF. The Board also recommended that the U.N. further investigate violations of international humanitarian law by those on both sides of the conflict: Israeli forces, Hamas, and other Palestinian militants. In April 2011, WikiLeaks released documents indicating that United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice contacted Ban on 4 May 2009 and successfully pressured him into rejecting Martin's recommendation for the far-reaching investigation. The United Nations Human Rights Council had by then redefined the scope of the investigation it had mandated and established the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict headed by Richard Goldstone. =Libya= Martin was named Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Post-Conflict Planning for Libya in April 2011 and was responsible for coordinating various agencies, funds, and programmes of the United Nations as well as consulting with the International Organization for Migration and the World Bank. During this work in Libya, he visited Benghazi and consulted the National Transitional Council. Martin was the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya from 11 September 2011 until 17 October 2012 when he was succeeded by Tarek Mitri. With Georg Charpentier as his Deputy, he led a staff of 200 tasked to assist with a range of duties including electoral assistance and police training. On 10 May 2012 Martin told the United Nations Security Council that there were credible reports of loyalists to toppled leader Muammar Gaddafi being mistreated and even tortured to death in detention centres under the transitional government's control. In April 2012, a bomb was thrown at a convoy in which he was travelling. On 8 August 2012 Martin was present in Tripoli as the National Transitional Council handed over power to the General National Congress. Other In 2003, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Essex. Martin was also Vice President of the International Center for Transitional Justice from 2002 to 2005. He has lectured on human rights at universities including Harvard Law School and his writings include Self-Determination in East Timor: the United Nations, the Ballot, and International Intervention. Views Martin has supported the International Commission of Jurists's conclusion that war crimes and acts of genocide had been committed by the Pakistan Army and its collaborators during the Bangladesh Liberation War. In supporting a trial for war crimes by the International Crimes Tribunal, he has voiced the opinion that the process must be free of political pressures. Martin is opposed to the death penalty and has campaigned against its use worldwide.

He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the younger brother of William Howard Taft of the powerful Taft family. He graduated from Yale University in 1883, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and won the Townsend Prize. He went on to Cincinnati Law School, but passed the bar after his second year and practiced law briefly at a firm with his father Alphonso Taft. Knowing he preferred education, he returned to Yale to tutor Latin. In 1890 he opened a college preparatory school for boys in Pelham Manor, New York. On 29 June 1892 he married Winifred Shepard Thompson, an art teacher at a New Haven high school. She died of cancer in 1909. There were no children of the marriage. In 1893 he moved his school to Watertown, Connecticut, purchasing the Warren House, a Civil War-era hotel, and adopting the name The Taft School in 1898. By 1913, the school had outgrown the hotel, and Mr. Taft commissioned the first permanent campus building, a collegiate gothic castle known as HDT, after Horace Dutton Taft and designed by architect Bertram Goodhue, with landscape architecture by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. The second major structure, completed in 1931, was designed by James Gamble Rogers and was named CPT after Horace Taft's brother Charles Phelps Taft, who was a major contributor to the Taft School. Horace Dutton Taft retired as headmaster in 1936 but continued to teach a course in Civics until his death.

The higher pressure on one side forces the usually wedge-shaped door into its socket, making a good seal and preventing it from being opened until the pressure is released. Non-plug doors rely on the strength of the locking mechanism to keep the door shut.  Aircraft  The plug door is often seen on aircraft with pressurized cabins. Due to the air pressure within the aircraft cabin being higher than that of the surrounding atmosphere, the door seals itself closed as the aircraft climbs and the pressure differential increases. This prevents accidental opening of the door. In the event of a decompression, with there no longer being a pressure differential, the doors may be opened, and as such most airlines' operating procedures require cabin crew to keep passengers away from the doors until the aircraft has safely landed. On some aircraft the plug door opens partially inward, and through a complex hinge design can be tilted to fit through the fuselage opening, or the door may have locking hinged panels at the top and bottom edges that can make it smaller than the opening, so that it may be swung outward. Plug doors are used on most modern airliners, particularly for the small passenger doors. However, since plug doors must open inward, the design is disadvantageous for cargo doors. Due to its large area, the cargo door on an airliner cannot be swung inside the fuselage without taking up a considerable amount of valuable cargo space. For this reason, these doors often open outward and use a locking mechanism with multiple pins or hatch dogs to prevent opening while in flight.  Spacecraft  Apollo 1 plug hatch in place, with external heat shield hatch open An inward opening plug hatch design was used on the Block I Apollo Command Module, because the explosive-release hatch of Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule Liberty Bell 7 prematurely blew at the end of the flight, causing the capsule to sink in the Atlantic Ocean and nearly resulting in Grissom's drowning. The Apollo cabin was pressurized at launch to above standard sea level pressure, which sealed the hatch. A cabin fire during a 1967 Apollo 1 ground test raised the pressure even higher (), and made the hatch impossible to remove for the crew to escape. This killed Grissom along with his entire crew, Edward H. White and Roger Chaffee. Because of this, NASA decided to change to a quick- release, outward opening hatch on the Command Module. Plug hatches were retained for the CM docking hatch and the two hatches on the Apollo Lunar Module, as the risk of fire in the low-pressure () in-space atmosphere was much lower. Plug doors were also used as the outer hatch doors on the Space Shuttle. Currently, they are used on the International Space Station, as well as on the hatch between the Orbital Module and Descent Module of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Deep-sea vehicles Deep-submergence vehicles such as the Alvin use a plug hatch which is sealed inward by the pressure of the ocean water.

The Braathens SAFE aircraft was en route on a scheduled flight from √Ölesund Airport, Vigra and crashed during approach to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Forty of the forty-five people on board the aircraft were killed, making it the deadliest civil aviation accident in Norway until Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 in 1996. According to Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet 23 December 1992, a Danish citizen died of late complications in 1976. The pilots took a short-cut during approach on runway 06 at Fornebu. Combined with false signals from the instrument landing system (ILS), this caused the pilots to misunderstand their location. This in turn led them to take an incorrect landing path, causing the plane to hit ground in a hilly area. The rescue operation was initiated almost immediately, but it took six and a half hours to find the aircraft. Three years later, the investigation commission concluded that various measures should be put in place to improve navigation, to avoid similar situations in which pilots misunderstood their location. Flight The accident aircraft, a Fokker F28 Fellowship 1000 had aircraft registration LN-SUY and was named Sverre Sigurdsson. It was equipped with two Rolls-Royce Spey Jr. 555-15 engines. Braathens SAFE was the launch customer of the F28 and Sverre Sigurdsson was the first F28 to fly in revenue service, in early 1969. By 1972 Braathens had six such aircraft in its fleet. The airline had seen some operational difficulties as an early operator of the aircraft type. LN-SUY had serial number 11011 and had at the time of the accident flown 8228 hours and had conducted 16710 cycles. It had a capacity of sixty-five passengers, and was insured with Norsk Flyforsikringspool. Flight 239 was a scheduled service from √Ölesund Airport, Vigra to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, estimated to take 45 minutes. It was marginally delayed when it departed Vigra at 16:00 with a crew of three and forty-two passengers, including four babies. As the flight was the day before Christmas Eve, it was largely used by people traveling home or to visit family for Christmas and people heading abroad for Christmas holiday. The captain had been employed by Braathens for sixteen years, the last ten as captain. There was one member of cabin crew. As it was a short domestic flight, only soda pop and beer were served, not coffee. Crash The norm for landing at Fornebu was to rendezvous with a radio beacon, Rumba, and conduct a fifteen-degree left turn for about half a minute. The aircraft would then be aligned with the 06 runway and could glide down following the instrument landing system (ILS). This maneuver would nominally take place at an altitude of 1,100 meters (3,500 ft). However, in clear weather the pilots often opted for a short-cut to reach the approach path more quickly. Because of the topography, it was possible that the ILS beams would deviate up to twenty-five degrees, which could cause the pilots to turn the aircraft too early and would cause the aircraft to fly over a range of hills on the wrong heading. This was a known fault with the system and pilots would therefore check the direction of the radio beacon at Asker to ensure they were in the correct position. This short-cut was carried out by Flight 239. The pilots therefore had full control of the aircraft, but were not aware of their location at the time of the impact. They carried out their turn about too early. At this time the pilots were having a private conversation concerning Christmas celebrations with the air traffic controller. The aircraft descended below the lowest safe altitude and lowered its gear and flaps as if they were on the nominal bearing. Sverre Sigurdsson was flying a course too far east and was possibly flying through strong winds. The impact took place at 16:33 close to the lake of Asd√∏ltjern in Vestmarka. The aircraft was off course in darkness and fog. Rescue Seven people survived the impact, although they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which was burning, and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards that they were all apathetic and in shock, and that none of them thought about the possibilities to search for help. Also, none of them knew where they were. They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty. Fornebu Air Traffic Control noticed that the aircraft disappeared from their radar and notified Asker and B√¶rum Police District at 16:36 that there was a potential crash. Fornebu contacted Drammen Police District at 16:57 and asked for a search in the area around the farm at Solli. The air traffic control estimated the area in which they believed the aircraft must have been in. Despite that their estimate for the crash site was accurate, they gave the police an incorrect sector to search in. Asker and B√¶rum Police District dispatched two patrols at 17:00, one from Asker to Solli and one from Sandvika to Nikebatteriet. The patrol from Asker passed almost right by the crash site and stopped to investigate, but found no indications of the wreckage. At 17:13 the police requested that crew be allocated to Nikebatteriet to conduct a search and rescue operation. The overall coordination was carried out by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway (JRCC SN). By 18:30 a base of operations had been established at Solli and thirty people were searching for the aircraft. At that time, the crash site was outside the defined area of search. The operation was also made more difficult as peaks and high ground were prioritized, while the aircraft was in fact located on a wooded gentle slope. Because of the holiday season, people were on leave and it took time for the police to dispatch sufficient crew to carry out a proper search operation. At 19:00, the second base of operations was established at the farm at Rustand. Another thirty people were sent out to look for the wreckage and additional crew were called in. At 20:30 the police and air traffic control started to question if search area was correct and therefore decided to expand it. This placed the crash site just within the search perimeter. A second expansion of the sector took place at 22:00. By this time more than a thousand people, professionals and volunteers, were participating. The wreckage was found at 22:50 by a volunteer group, who had walked along the estimated route of the aircraft. Five minutes later crew from Sylling Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps arrived at the site. At this time the operations center was alerted of the find and JRCC SN was alerted at 23:07. A helicopter was dispatched from Fornebu at 23:24 and landed at Solli at 23:41 to pick up a medical doctor. It continued to the crash site, guided by the car lights of the volunteer search crew. It picked up the badly wounded and used two trips to bring them to Solli, where they were sent by ambulance to hospital. Two more wounded were carried to ambulances which had driven to the site. The search and rescue operation was officially concluded at 23:59. Investigation LN-SUN, the sister aircraft of LN-SUY An investigation commission was appointed, consisted of three regular members, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Eirik Sandberg, Police Inspector Johan Fr. Kielland and Pilot Eivind Veierstad, in addition to their secretary, Hans Georg Andersen. Arne Viik, an expert in aviation navigation, was appointed for the individual investigation. The commission's regular members were contacted at 17:00 on the day of the accident and they started their work immediately. The wreck was taken to Fornebu for investigation, the flight recorder was sent to Copenhagen and the altimeters were sent to the United States. They interviewed several hundred people, flew the flight with a similar aircraft in the same light and weather conditions and by February 1973 had collected more than two and a half meters of notes and documents. Because of the navigational errors, the commission test-flew the route several times. When the beacon was transmitting false signals and they followed them without correlating by other means, the commission's test flights gave a course that would have resulted in a crash, had they not aborted. After a year, one of the commission's members was replaced, as his tenure was finished. This delayed the work as his replacement had to go through all the findings to catch up. The duration of the investigation was criticized by the press and next of kin, but the commission stated that it was necessary with a prescribed degree of diligence in the matter. An issue of particular interest was the ILS system at Fornebu, which would under given circumstances produce false signals. The commission found no way of terminating the shortcomings. By August 1975 a preliminary report was sent to the involved parties. Despite promises of immediate release, the publication was postponed further to sort out further details. The final draft was given to the Ministry of Transport and Communications on 18 December. The report went public on 4 January 1976. The commission concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a navigational error which must have taken place before the aircraft had descended to 1,100 meters (3,500 ft). No technical faults were found with the aircraft. The report stated that there were some shortcomings in crew procedures: a measurement for direction control had been moved to a less visible location, a radio compass was set at the wrong frequency so it received bearings from Lahti, a conversation related to the holidays with air traffic control and that the captain was not as rested as he could have been according to regulations. The commission could not find that the weather or the wind was a contributing cause, although the darkness and fog could have hindered the crew from gaining a visual cue to their location. The bulk of the report was dedicated to the navigational aids at Fornebu. The report underlined that false signals from the radio beacon were an important underlying cause. It noted that the beacon for runway 01 interfered with that for 06 and that up to three false signals could be transmitted. The commission recommended airlines enforce routines which ensured that multiple systems for determining position and bearing always be used, as a single system would never be reliable. It also recommended an extra radio beacon be installed in Drammen to aid approach to runway 06 and that airlines in the meantime not rely solely on radio beacons during approach to 06. The report also looked at the work-flow at the air traffic control. The airport had a radar system installed, but this was used solely for monitoring traffic and was not seen as a navigational aid. The commission commented that air traffic control could have prevented the accident had it recognized that the aircraft was on the wrong path and alerted the pilots. Sufficient equipment was installed, but there were no instructions for such activity. Aftermath Flight 239 is the deadliest aviation accident on mainland Norway and second-deadliest in the entire country, only surpassed by Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 which killed 141 people in 1996 on the Svalbard archipelago. It was the second accident of the F28 and the first fatal accident. It remains the eleventh-deadliest F28 accident. The deceased were sent to their home communities for burial. Twenty-five of them were from around √Ölesund and were sent to Vigra via a special Boeing 737-200 flight by Braathens SAFE on 29 December. A memorial service was held at the airport before the coffins were distributed to the respective parishes. A memorial to the victims was erected near the crash sites, located along a popular skiing trail between Myggheim and Sandungen.

Content  The poems in The Call of the Marching Bell were written by Iqbal over a period of twenty years; the collection is divided into three parts: #Poems written before 1905, the year Iqbal left British India for England. These include nursery, pastoral, and patriotic verses. \\"Tarana-e-Hindi\\" (\\"The Song of India\\") has become an anthem, and is sung or played in India at national events. \\"Hindustani Bachon Ka Qaumi Geet\\" (National Anthem for Indian Children) is another well-known song. #Poems written between 1905 and 1908, the period he spent as a student in Europe. He praises the rationality and pragmatism of the West, but complains about its overt materialism, loss of spirituality, and narrow patriotism, which promises suffering. This situation strengthened his belief in the universal values of Islam, and he resolved to use his poetry to stir Muslims to a renaissance. #Poems written between 1908 and 1923, in which Iqbal reminds Muslims of their past greatness and calls for a sense of brotherhood and unity that transcends territorial boundaries. He urges the ummah to live a life of servitude to God, of sacrifice, and of action so that they may attain once more the high civilisation that was once theirs. \\"Yam Awr Shair\\" (\\"The Poet and the Cradle\\"), \\"Shikwa\\" (\\"The Complaint to God\\"), \\"Jawab-i-Shikwa\\" (\\"The Response to the Complaint\\"), \\"Khizr-i-Rah\\" (\\"Guidance\\"), and \\"Tulu'i Islam\\" (\\"Light of Islam\\") are considered among the greatest Islamic poems.Syed Abdul Vahid (1955) Introduction to Iqbal.

Learning was enhanced via the use of jokes and funny sayings as verbal reinforcements for performance. 2-XL was heralded as an important step in the development of toys, particularly educational ones. 2-XL won many awards, and Playthings, a toy industry magazine, placed 2-XL on its 75th anniversary cover as one of the industry's top-ten toys of all time. The 2-XL name is a pun of the phrase \\"To Excel\\".\\"The kids' Whole Earth Catalogue, Random House book, 1982, ISBN Number 0-394-85090-4 History and development The toy was invented and licensed for manufacture by Michael J. Freeman, inventor, Ph.D. and was patented. 2-XL exhibited rudimentary intelligence, memory, gameplay, and responsiveness. Dubbed the \\"Toy with a Personality,\\" 2-XL could respond verbally to the user depending upon which \\"input or answer\\" buttons were chosen. 2-XL during its run was one of the most popular toys in terms of market revenue and was dubbed the Talking Robot with a mind of its own. The toy was voiced by Freeman, using a synthesizer to make his voice a high-pitched robot-like sound; it was through this process that Freeman developed 2-XL's personality. 2-XL was first introduced in 1978 by the Mego Corporation, a publicly traded US-based toy company in New York City and it subsequently became a success. The toy was sold in different countries and the tapes were translated into seven foreign languages. Games were also developed for the toy. Mego, otherwise known for its production of dolls and classic action figures in the 1970s, was seen as an innovator combining toys and education. The toy's name literally meant \\"To Excel\\". The toy was voice capable, was able to tell stories, and sing using its special 8-track tapes. The toy's tapes asked multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that were answered by pushing a YES or NO button that changed the tracking of the tape. It was a crude but reportedly innovative use of the technology that was present in that era. In addition to its general popularity, 2-XL was unprecedented in terms of market revenue. \\"The 2XL was hot, in demand, and everyone wanted one.\\" \\"It was a great way to make learning cool and fun.\\" Playthings magazine, in its cover story of September 1978, considered the 2-XL robot as one of the most important toys ever developed, and included it in a class of \\"toys with impact\\" along with the Teddy Bear, Barbie Doll, Raggedy Ann, Mickey Mouse among others.\\"75 Years of Toys\\" Playthings Magazine, September 2008, Volume 9, Cover page Story. Progressive Business Media. Retrieved October 11, 2011. The robot was a popular educational toy whose success anticipated the dominant influence of technology in education today. Dubbed the \\"Toy with a Personality,\\" 2-XL could respond verbally to the user depending upon which \\"input or answer\\" buttons were chosen. Part of the reason for this is the connection the toy made between education and fun. \\"2-XL was a glorious display of plastic robotics.\\" 2-XL was interactive playing various tracks from a magnetic audio tape depending on the user's actions. 2-XL's personality was very popular and kids loved the back-and-forth banter. For example, If a child got an answer wrong 2-XL might utter something like: \\"perhaps your brain went on strike! You are Wrong.\\" Or, \\"Nice try but (whispering) you are wrong, but go ahead, I will be a nice little toy robot and give you a second chance now.\\" \\"Even though you needed two chances you finally got the answer right, elephant is the correct answer\\"'. \\"But do not get too excited, you have now earned yourself a more difficult question. Hold on to your hat, here it comes\\" If the child was right, 2-XL might say: \\"Although I have the looks you have the brains. You must be a genius. Good work.\\" Or, \\"it is amazing that big brain of yours fits into the head of a child. Nice answer, football is correct.\\" In 1981, the toy's popularity waned, and it was later discontinued. In 1992, 2-XL was re-introduced by Tiger Electronics, a toy company based in Vernon Hills, Illinois. The toy was changed into a more modern design, and new programmed toy cartridges were also introduced. The voice for this version was done by Freeman as well, and all programs were translated into many different languages. Versions =Mego Corporation version= The 2-XL educational toy robot distributed by Mego Corporation in 1978 The original version, created by Mego Corporation, was made of brown plastic with white plastic found on the anterior face of the robot. It had two red light bulbs for the eyes. These bulbs also flashed at moments while 8-track cartridge tape programs played. It had four red buttons on its stomach with designated options for answers to questions asked by the toy, such as \\"Question,\\" \\"A or Yes Or True,\\" \\"B or More Info,\\" and \\"C or No or False. A knob is also found on the lower right portion of the toy which controlled its volume and power. The \\"mouth\\" was reused detail molding taken from the Micronauts Battle Cruiser. At the bottom was a large slot for the 8-track cartridge tapes. This particular version was essentially a regular 8-track tape player, but by utilizing unique, clever, and patented mathematical decision tree programming methods, over 20 interactive modes of operation were achieved. It seemed to most people like a computer which had enough information and interactive questions to entertain and educate a child (or adult) up to two hours. Subjects included sports quiz, Guinness Book of World Records, the metric system, general information and jokes. The mold and look got a minor change in 1980. The eye lights became red and responded to the voice. The flashing lights also became brighter, and the speaker in the back of the unit was changed from a hexagon shape to a more traditional round. The plastic was glossier looking. =Tiger Electronics version= A 2-XL X-Men cassette tape. The 2-XL version with its cassette tapes distributed by Tiger Electronics in 1992 Tiger Electronics re- introduced 2-XL in 1992. Instead of using 8-track cartridge tapes, this version used cassette tapes that were twice the length of the tapes in the previous version and had a better sound quality. Freeman again recorded the 2-XL voice for the cassette tapes in a professional sound studio. In addition to eyes that would light up the toy now sported a circle for a mouth that could light up as the machine talked. The toy could now run on batteries and had a headphone jack. Instead of the buttons simply switching tracks on the 8-track tape as in the old version, the cassette version took advantage of the fact that a cassette has a total of four tracks - one for the left and right channel on each side. The tape head in the player could play any of the four parallel tracks, based on which button was pressed. Playing a 2-XL tape in a standard tape player would result in different audio on the left and right channels, and if the reverse side was played, one would hear the other two tracks played in reverse. Using all four tracks simultaneously was unique to 2-XL and provided the basis for the interactive give and take. As with the previous version, this version could play any standard tape of similar tape, but the user needed to first push the \\"Question\\" button (or the \\"2/A/No\\" button would work as well, playing the correct channel). Pressing three or four buttons would play one of the channels on the reverse side of the tape backwards. Newly released tapes were branded with comic book and cartoon characters, including Spider-Man, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, X-Men and Batman. 2-XL games would allow the user to go on an adventure with various superheroes, deciding their fate by pushing one of the buttons. The second version was on the market from 1992 through 1996, and about 45 tapes were released in total. The toy was sold internationally, including in Japan, Germany, Hungary, Italy, France, England, Canada, Brazil (where it was distributed by Nintendo's official local licenser Playtronic) and others. The tapes were translated into many foreign languages, but were not recorded by Freeman.  Television series spinoff  The toy's success was also the basis for a game show called Pick Your Brain produced by Marc Summers Productions and Summit Media Group. The 2-XL robot in the show served as the assistant of Marc Summers. 2-XL was also a spokesrobot for basketball player Michael Jordan and his charitable foundation in 1992 and 1993 and appeared in a number of PSA (public service announcements) with Jordan.

The remainder programs were each sold separately: =List of 2-XL tapes manufactured by Tiger Electronics between 1992 and 1995= The World of 2-XL was sold with each toy robot. The remainder programs were each sold separately: =Trilex= One of the last tapes released for the Mego Corporation version of 2XL was \\"Trilex\\", a complete board game designed to be played against 2XL. The tape came with a board which fitted over the front of the 2XL unit itself, with the board in front of the tape slot. The game board consisted of an inverted pyramid shape, 4 squares wide at the top to 1 square at the bottom, with each row colored in a different color (Blue, Yellow, Green, and Tan), and 4 slots through which pieces (which 2XL called \\"checkers\\") could be dropped into the pyramid. The slots aligned with 2XL's 4 buttons, with the intention that dropping the checker would also press the appropriate track button on 2XL. The objective of the game was to create either a line or a triangle of three checkers of a selected color. The game and tape design are interesting because they enabled the 4-track tape player to provide a passable simulation of a game-playing AI. Merchandising A number of secondary products were licensed under the 2-XL (2XL) name including: laptop computer bags, earphones, lunch boxes and more.  Awards  During its time, both iterations of 2-XL won hundreds of awards, including FamilyFun magazine's award for best toy of 1992, and Right Start Magazines honor as Europe's best toy in the 3-5 year-old category for 1993. For the 75th anniversary issue of Playthings magazine, 2-XL was featured on the cover and named one of the top ten toys of all time. The Tiger 2-XL was also the winner of the 1992 Walt Disney Company Best Learning Toy for 1992.

History The park was traditionally used by the Sekani and Dunneza (Beaver) first nations. During the late 18th century European fur trappers, traders, and explorers moved into and through the area. Fur trading posts were established in the surrounding area at Fort St. John, Hudson's Hope and Fort Nelson. With the development of the Alaska Highway in 1943, improved access encouraged the development of forestry and gas exploration. Road development further facilitated use by the public who sought out the unique opportunity to view the diverse wildlife species found in the area. In 1997 the Fort St. John Land and Resource Management Plan recommended the area for protection. It was subsequently designated as a provincial park in 1999. The primary role of Pink Mountain Provincial Park is to protect a significant palaeontological site containing examples of large fauna from the Mesozoic Era. Conservation Pink Mountain Provincial Park is located in the Muskwa Foothills eco-section. This area represents a part of the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The subalpine zone, located at 1100 to 1550 m elevation consists primarily of black and white spruce, lodgepole pine, willow and birch. Above 1550 m, the area consists of alpine tundra vegetation. The vegetation consists of shrubs, herbs, mosses and lichens which all contribute to support the significant diversity of wildlife species.http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/pink_mt/nat_cul.html#conservation Wildlife Pink Mountain protects important habitat for numerous large herbivores such as caribou, elk and moose. Plains bison, a relative newcomer to the area, was introduced in 1968 and has since thrived. The area is also internationally recognized for its arctic butterflies, which are at their southernmost limit of distribution. Butterflies are attracted to Pink Mountain by the unmatched concentration of tundra plants. The diversity of plants is unique. Peaks of similar elevation in the area do not display anything like the variety of arctic/alpine plants that occurs on Pink Mountain. Significant species found within the park and surrounding area include grizzly and black bear, lynx, fisher, and wolverine. =Caribou= The Pink Mountain caribou herd, also referred to as the Sikanni Chief, Cypress River, Prophet River, Cameron-Chowade, and Beatton-Blueberry caribou herd, are part of the Northern Mountain Population within the Northern Mountains National Ecological Area (NMNEA). Pink Mountain caribou are classified as montane and northern caribou ecotypes of the North American subspecies Rangifer tarandus (woodland caribou). Northern caribou herds, in general and the Pink Caribou Herd in particular, were listed as vulnerable by the committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). blue-listed (special concern status) provincially by the British Columbia Conservation Data Centre. In 1996 there were 1,300 animals. By 2002 the numbers had declined to 850 animals and was declining (IWMS 2004). Location Pink Mountain Provincial Park is located approximately 180 km northwest of Fort St. John. It is reached by turning west off the Alaska Highway at mile 147, onto Road #192. This road proceeds in a south-westerly direction for 16 km. At this point there is a fork in the road, access to Pink Mountain is by the northerly fork which travels up Pink Mountain via a number of switchbacks. The road to the summit of Pink Mountain is not maintained in winter and is accessible by vehicle only from late spring to fall. Size in size.

Plumper Cove Marine Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada. The park is located on Keats Island in Howe Sound, northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia. It is one of the oldest marine parks on the BC coast, and a popular anchorage in the summer months. The 57-hectare park is located on the northwest shore of Keats Island. The park has a well maintained hiking trail system, a grassy upland picnic area and forested walk-in campsites. The trail system consists of 'Keats Loop' which leads to the top of a bluff to a lookout, and then there is a trail which leads to Keats' Landing, the final segment of which can be travelled either by dirt road or trail. The trail is of intermediate level, easy to hike when not laden with camping gear, but somewhat arduous when hiking in with several days worth of camping supplies. It is roughly uphill and downhill either direction, and somewhat near the trail's middle it peaks near the lookout. There are only two ways for the public to access the park; by marine access or by hiking in. Travellers can take BC Ferries from Horseshoe Bay to Langdale, then board the Stornaway II which makes infrequent trips to Keats' Island and Gambier Island, then hike roughly to the campground. The trail from Keats Landing to Plumper Cove Marine Park is NOT bike friendly, and most trails on the island are similarly challenging - bicycles are not recommended but good walking shoes will get you where you need to go! Alternately, via marine access, one with their own boat can navigate and pay moorage fees at the park dock. Several water taxi services are available from Gibsons to Plumper Cove Marine Park, but these are somewhat erratic and do not operate on a regular schedule, sometimes requiring a charter. The park is known for its quiet and natural surroundings. Unlike many other provincial campgrounds which have vehicle access, traffic by locals there to drink and make loud noise is limited. Occasionally people from Gibsons, British Columbia or those who have cabins on Keats Island will park a barge or tie together a series of boats and have a private flotilla party, although this is rare and usually only occurs on peak long weekends. Due to the natural surroundings, lack of vehicle access, and dedication or investment in a marine vehicle to get to the park, the park is lovingly referred to by those who frequent it regularly as \\"the best campground in BC\\". Those from Vancouver, British Columbia who frequent the park tend to go back every year on the same weekends at the same time, and tend to not advertise to their fellow city dwellers about the park in order to keep it private and from it getting too busy. From September 24 to May 15, the park does not charge camping fees, but has limited services available. Normally, during peak summer months, the camping fee is $16 per night per party (party up to four). There are group campsites available which are double sites for larger parties. Group picknicking services are available by private reservation only. Moorage at a buoy costs $12 per night, and moorage at the dock costs $2.00 per metre per night. Docking and moorage fees only apply after 6pm. During the winter months most services are free of charge. Garbage service is very limited (if at all) and visitors should plan to pack out anything they may bring. The park has potable water available from a hand pump only from May 15th to Sep 15th and the pit toilets are open year around. Due to storm damage in the winter of 2006 the dock at the Park was destroyed, and replaced in 2007.

It was established in 1974, and encompasses six large drainages in the Purcell Mountains in the southeast of the province. It contains high peaks, alpine meadows and ridges, deep creek and river valleys, and hot springs at Dewar Creek. History The northern part of the park covers an important historical trade and transportation route used by First Nations people for centuries, linking the Rocky Mountain Trench and Kootenay Lake via Toby Pass. Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada, traveled the trail in 1908, after which it was named in his honour. Grey was impressed by the area and built a cabin on Toby Creek. He also approached Premier Richard McBride about protecting the area within a park, but the plans did not come about. The region saw periods of mining activity, including the Argenta Mine near Hamill Peak. It operated for only one year in 1904 and 1905. Some of the equipment is still found inside the park. By the 1960s, logging had reached further into the Purcells. Area residents, outdoor clubs, and conservation groups lobbied the Provincial and Federal Governments for a park in the region. In 1974, the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy (PWC) was established, protecting . The St. Mary's Alpine Provincial Park, adjacent to the southern boundary of the PWC, was established in the same year. The PWC was one of the first areas in Canada conserved because of citizen activism. In 1995, the PWC expanded to its current size and was named a Class A Provincial Park by the government. Geography The Purcell Wilderness Conservancy covers the central region of the southern half of the Purcell Range in the south east of the province, often referred to as the Kootenays. The nearest settlements are Argenta, to the west, and Invermere to the east. The park encompasses several large drainages in their entirety, and contains the headwaters of several other large streams and rivers. On the western side of the park, Hamill, Fry, and Carney Creeks flow into Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River system. On the eastern side, Toby, Dutch, and Finlay Creeks flow into the Columbia River. St. Mary's River and Skookumchuck Creek flow from the south of the park, also into the Kootenay drainage. The mountainous park has many peaks and glaciers. The tallest peaks are Mount Hamill (), Mount Toby (), and Mount Truce () in the north, and Mount Findlay (), near the centre of the park. The Toby Glacier () is in the north of the park, and forms the headwaters for Toby Creek. =Geology= The PWC region is composed of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rock, and contains some of the oldest rock in the province. Fossils can be found within the park. The oldest rock layer is from the Proterozoic period; this is interspersed with granitic intrusions, or batholiths, similar to the Bugaboos to the north. Some of the high peaks are a mix of granite or quartzite; these features are usually more massive and rounded. Other peaks are more pointed and abrupt, these are formed from slate rock. Much of the park shows the effects of glaciation. Hot springs are also present alongside Dewar Creek in the south of the park. Flora and fauna The PWC contains five of British Columbia's biogeoclimatic zones. The wetter western portion of the park has Interior Cedar‚ÄîHemlock forests, while the drier eastern valleys feature both Ponderosa Pine and Interior Douglas-fir. The higher slopes are dominated by Engelmann Spruce‚ÄîSubalpine Fir, which give way to the Alpine Tundra biome at the highest altitudes that support life. Many large mammals are present in the park, including grizzly and black bears, mule and whitetail deer, moose, mountain caribou, and mountain goats. Biologists have identified 90 bird species within the park. The streams and rivers support Dolly Varden, rainbow and cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish. Conservation The PWC is preserved in its natural state; there are no roads or facilities beyond rough campgrounds within the park. Mechanized access, including helicopters, is prohibited. It is considered the largest intact ecosystem in southeastern B.C.

The New York Times, 12 November 1989, retrieved 18 January 2008 Background Spence attended Syracuse University before becoming a correspondent for ABC News. During the Vietnam War, he covered Southeast Asia, but eventually left the network after being expelled by South Vietnam for alleged black market currency transactions -- a not unknown practice for removing troublesome reporters. He relocated to Tokyo where he was a stringer for Britain's Daily Mail and began doing public relations consulting for the government-supported Japan External Trade Organization and Japanese corporations. In January 1985, Spence registered with the U.S. State Department as a foreign agent for Japan and began lobbying for Japanese interests. Throughout the 1980s, Spence built a reputation as an influential lobbyist who represented many Japanese concerns and established close friendships with a number of leading Japanese politicians, including Motoo Shiina, considered by Tokyo analysts to be an inside favorite to replace scandal-plagued S≈çsuke Uno as prime minister.Jerry Seper and Michael Hedges, \\"Spence was target before raid on ring\\" The Washington Times Part A; Pg. A1 July 10, 1989 Spence and Mr. Shiina were embroiled in a real estate deal involving the house in Kalorama, a two-story Victorian showpiece valued by real estate agents at $1.15 million. Spence had told friends that he obtained the money to buy the house by blackmailing Mr. Shiina. Mr. Shiina denied he was blackmailed by Mr. Spence. Spence was implicated in a scandal around a gay call-boy ring that arranged after-hours visits to the White House, the Washington Times and other papers reported in June 1989. Afterward, Spence committed suicide in a Boston hotel. Washington call-boy scandal Spence's name came to national prominence in the aftermath of a June 28, 1989 article in the Washington Times identifying Spence as a customer of a homosexual escort service being investigated by the Secret Service, the District of Columbia Police and the United States Attorney's Office for suspected credit card fraud. The newspaper said he spent as much as $20,000 a month on the service. He had also been linked to a White House guard who has said he accepted an expensive watch from Mr. Spence and allowed him and friends to take late-night White House tours.Washington Times, June 29 1989 Spence entered a downward spiral in the wake of the Washington Times expos√©, increasingly involving himself with call boys and crack,Michael Hedges and Jerry Seper, \\"Spence arrested in N.Y., released; Once-host to powerful reduced to begging, sleeping in park\\" The Washington Times August 9, 1989 and culminating in his July 31, 1989 arrest at the Barbizon Hotel on East 63rd St in Manhattan for criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of cocaine.

Michael Hedges and Jerry Seper of The Washington Times reported that \\"Mr. Spence hinted the tours were arranged by 'top level' persons\\", including Donald Gregg, national security adviser to Vice President George H. W. Bush at the time the tours were given. When pressed to identify who it was who got him inside the White House, Spence asked \\"Who was it who got [long-term CIA operative] F√©lix Rodr√≠guez in to see Bush?\\", agreeing that he was alluding to Mr. Gregg.

The Antarctic bottom water (AABW) is a type of water mass in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica with temperatures ranging from ‚àí0.8 to 2 ¬∞C (35 ¬∞F), salinities from 34.6 to 34.7 psu. Being the densest water mass of the oceans, AABW is found to occupy the depth range below 4000 m of all ocean basins that have a connection to the Southern Ocean at that level. The major significance of Antarctic bottom water is that it is the coldest bottom water, giving it a significant influence on the movement of the world's oceans. Antarctic bottom water also has a high oxygen content relative to the rest of the oceans' deep waters. This is due to the oxidation of deteriorating organic content in the rest of the deep oceans. Antarctic bottom water has thus been considered the ventilation of the deep ocean. Formation and circulation Antarctic bottom water is created in part due to the major overturning of ocean water. Antarctic bottom water is formed in the Weddell and Ross Seas, off the Ad√©lie Coast and by Cape Darnley from surface water cooling in polynyas and below the ice shelf. A unique feature of Antarctic bottom water is the cold surface wind blowing off the Antarctic continent. The surface wind creates the polynyas which opens up the water surface to more wind. This Antarctic wind is stronger during the winter months and thus the Antarctic bottom water formation is more pronounced during the Antarctic winter season. Surface water is enriched in salt from sea ice formation. Due to its increased density, it flows down the Antarctic continental margin and continues north along the bottom. It is the densest water in the free ocean, and underlies other bottom and intermediate waters throughout most of the southern hemisphere. The Weddell Sea Bottom Water is the densest component of the Antarctic bottom water. Evidence indicates that Antarctic bottom water production through the Holocene (last 10,000 years) is not in a steady-state condition; that is to say that bottom water production sites shift along the Antarctic margin over decade to century timescales as conditions for the existence of polynyas change. For example, the calving of the Mertz Glacier, which occurred on 12‚Äì13 February 2010, dramatically changed the environment for producing bottom water, reducing export by up to 23% in the region of Adelie Land. Evidence from sediment cores, containing layers of cross-bedded sediments indicating phases of stronger bottom currents, collected on the Mac.Robertson shelf and Ad√©lie Land suggests that they have switched \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" again as important bottom water production sites over the last several thousand years. AABW flow in the Equatorial Atlantic =Atlantic Ocean= The Vema Channel, a deep trough in the Rio Grande Rise of the South Atlantic at , is an important conduit for Antarctic Bottom Water and Weddell Sea Bottom Water migrating north. Upon reaching the equator, about one-third of the northward flowing Antarctic bottom water enters the Guiana Basin, mainly through the southern half of the Equatorial Channel at 35¬∞W. The other part recirculates and some of it flows through the Romanche Fracture Zone into the eastern Atlantic. In the Guiana Basin, west of 40¬∞W, the sloping topography and the strong, eastward flowing deep western boundary current might prevent the Antarctic bottom water from flowing west: thus it has to turn north at the eastern slope of the Cear√° Rise. At 44¬∞W, north of the Cear√° Rise, Antarctic bottom water flows west in the interior of the basin. A large fraction of the Antarctic bottom water enters the eastern Atlantic through the Vema Fracture Zone. Pathways of AABW =Indian Ocean= In the Indian Ocean the Crozet- Kerguelen Gap allows Antarctic bottom water to move toward the equator. This northward movement amounts to 2.5 Sv. It takes the Antarctic Bottom Water 23 years to reach the Crozet-Kerguelen Gap. South of Africa, Antarctic bottom water flow northwards through the Agulhas Basin and then east through the Agulhas Passage and over the southern margins of the Agulhas Plateau from where it is transported to into the Mozambique Basin.  Climate change  Climate change and the subsequent melting of the Southern ice sheet have slowed the formation of AABW, and this slowdown is likely to continue. A complete shutdown of AABW formation is possible as soon as 2050. This shutdown would have dramatic effects on ocean circulation and global weather patterns.

The screenplay is based on his 1998 off- Broadway play of the same name,The Dying Gaul at the Lortel Archives the title of which was derived from an ancient Roman marble copy of a lost Hellenistic sculpture. Plot In 1995 Hollywood, novice screenwriter Robert Sandrich has written an autobiographical script inspired by his lover's death by AIDS- related cerebral tuberculosis. It impresses both studio executive Jeffrey Tishop and his wife Elaine, but for commercial reasons Jeffrey is willing to greenlight the project only if Robert changes his protagonist from Maurice to Maggie and shifts the focus of his plot from gay to straight people. Robert initially refuses to compromise his principles, but when Jeffrey threatens to make the film without his participation, he decides to accept the $1 million paycheck he's been offered and make the requested edits. Both Jeffrey and Elaine find themselves attracted to Robert, who becomes a frequent guest in their Malibu home and soon drifts into a sexual relationship with the manipulative producer. The connection Elaine feels to the grieving young man is more emotional and cerebral than physical and, after discovering Robert is addicted to Internet chat rooms, she tracks him down online and engages him in conversation while posing as a gay man. Using information he has revealed to her in person, she convinces him that he is communicating with his dead lover. Complications ensue when Robert reveals he's having an affair with Jeffrey, which forces Elaine to face the truth about her seemingly perfect marriage and prompts a confrontation that leads to tragedy. Cast *Patricia Clarkson as Elaine Tishop *Peter Sarsgaard as Robert Sandrich *Campbell Scott as Jeffrey Tishop *Elizabeth Marvel as Kelly Cartonis *Bill Camp as Malcolm Distribution The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2005 and was shown at the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival, the Provincetown International Film Festival, the Philadelphia International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the Montr√©al World Film Festival, Film Fest New Haven, the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival before opening in eleven theaters in the United States on November 4, 2005. Critical reception Stephen Holden of the New York Times called the film \\"a boldly expressionistic, proudly theatrical film\\" and wrote that Craig Lucas \\"makes an auspicious, nervy debut as a screen director.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times thought \\"there are implausibilities in the plot devices that lead the movie to its ultimate conclusion. And then the final developments themselves, I think, are wrong in both theory and practice. There is some ambiguity about why a final event takes place, and that's all right, but the way in which the movie reveals it is, I think, singularly ineffective. It leads to one of those endings where you sit there wishing they'd tried a little harder to think up something better.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle observed the film \\"has the best kind of story in that it unfolds as a series of surprises, and yet every step, twist and turn seems inevitable in retrospect. Just in terms of plot, it's a meticulous piece of construction, with key information gracefully planted and nothing extraneous. On mechanics alone, it would qualify as satisfying entertainment. Yet The Dying Gaul is hardly a mere mechanical construction . . . Lucas' insight into the subtleties of interaction ‚Äì and the churning depths that those subtleties suggest ‚Äì is of a whole other order than that of most film directors. In this psychological thriller, the psychological isn't neglected; it's intrinsic.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \\"Lucas the director serves Lucas the playwright beautifully, giving the film a seductive gleam that only enhances the shock when he reveals the toxicity underneath. The actors could not be better. Sarsgaard, Scott and the luminous Clarkson negotiate the film's razor-sharp laughs and bone-deep tragedy with resonant skill. Lucas' powerfully haunting film gets under your skin.\\" Awards and nominations Craig Lucas was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The National Board of Review cited the film for Special Recognition For Excellence In Filmmaking. DVD release Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on March 21, 2006.

It was founded on July 4, 1953 by local boxing promoter Joe Mora. Long considered a local institution in El Paso, it is perhaps the city's best- known restaurant, having been featured in the Food Network show, The Best Thing I Ever Ate. It was also a topic of the Gabriel Iglesias stand up act, I'm not Fat... I'm Fluffy. Chico's has entered into local legend for its rolled tacos in a special tomato soup-like sauce, as well as its low prices. Other items on the menu include hamburgers, French fries, grilled cheese sandwiches (or as Chicos Tacos employees often refer to them as \\"grillos\\"), and special round hot dogs served on hamburger buns. Originally located at 4230 Alameda Avenue on El Paso's south side, Chico's has since expanded to five El Paso locations, primarily on the town's east side. Since Mora's death in 1992, the restaurants have been run by his surviving children. Menu specialties Chico's Tacos' specialty dish is a paper tray containing three rolled taquitos, referred to as flautas, submerged in bath of a special tomato soup-like sauce that is topped with shredded Cheese. The custom is to pick up a taco individually from the special tomato sauce, then using a fork, scoop the melted cheese onto the taco before taking a bite. The most commonly ordered items are the single order (three tacos) or double order (six tacos). Often, many devotees will order two single orders instead of one double order, to take advantage of the best in cheese to taco ratios. In addition to their legendary tacos, Chico's Tacos are also known for their unique hot dogs. Unlike hotdogs commonly served in America, this menu item is served on a hamburger bun with two franks sliced in half lengthwise, topped with their chili, mustard, and pickles. Couple that with a side of crinkle cut fries (that some say taste best with Chico's special tomato sauce and a topping of cheese) makes for another tasty legend at Chico's Tacos. Recognition In 2003 the 78th Texas House of Representatives adopted a resolution (HR 84), introduced by El Paso representative Norma Chavez, honoring the Mora family and celebrating the restaurant's 50th anniversary. Standup comedian Gabriel Iglesias mentioned Chico's in his 2009 Comedy Central special I'm Not Fat, I'm Fluffy. During his routine, which was taped in El Paso, Iglesias referenced Chico's as \\"an El Paso tradition\\", to the applause of the audience.Iglesias, Gabriel. I'm Not Fat, I'm Fluffy Comedy Central; 2009  Legal Issues  In the late 2000s, the owners of Chico's Tacos sued an Austin-based restaurant, Chuco's Tacos, for trademark infringement. In addition to the name, which differed from Chico's by only one letter, Chuco's Tacos also featured a paper tray with rolled tacos in a tomato-based sauce as its main menu item. Chuco's Tacos went out of business on July 18, 2008, before the trial could begin.  Discrimination Controversy  On June 29, 2009, Chico's Tacos became the focus of gay-rights protestors when a group of five homosexual men were kicked out of the restaurant after two of them kissed publicly inside the restaurant. When the men did not leave immediately, the graveyard-shift security guard, Marcos Nava, an employee of All American International Security, called 911 in an attempt to have them removed by the El Paso Police Department. \\"There are two men eating here, and they're kissing,\\" Nava said in Spanish on the 911 recording released by authorities. \\"They are homosexuals. I approached them and told them that they couldn't be kissing here because there are children here. They were kissing on the lips.\\" The incident received widespread national attention, and the actions of the security guards and El Paso Police Department were widely condemned, including by the El Paso City Council. In light of this criticism, the restaurant's owners insisted that they have a policy of nondiscrimination, and that the men were ejected because they were unruly, not because they were homosexual. However, the two police officers responding to the 911 call allegedly threatened to have the men arrested for \\"homosexual conduct,\\" despite there being no such law on the books. As a result of the incident, police chief Greg Allen announced that all officers department-wide would undergo more extensive sensitivity and anti- discrimination training.

The reverse side of the button shows a portrait of his running mate Hannibal Hamlin. A campaign button is a pin used during an election as political advertising for (or against) a candidate or political party, or to proclaim the issues that are part of the political platform. Political buttons date as far back as President George Washington. They have taken many forms as the technology to create an image and mass production has allowed. In the late 18th and first half of the 19th century they were sewn-on clothing buttons, whereas the modern forms typically have pins on the back and are therefore also called pin-back buttons. Campaign buttons bear some similarity to bumper stickers, which are also used for political and other promotional messages. As a novelty item, campaign buttons are part of the hobby of collecting. History The first photographic image on pins dates to 1860. Abraham Lincoln and his various opponents used the tintype or ferrotype photo process. The first mass production of metal buttons dates to the 1896 William McKinley campaign for president with \\"celluloid\\" buttons with one side of a metal disk covered with paper (printed with the message) and protected by a layer of clear plastic. William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign button Since 1916, buttons have also been produced by lithographing the image directly onto the metal disk. A celluloid-type button is fastened to a garment using a pin on the back side of the button (in recently produced buttons, the pin generally fits into a safety-pin-style catch). A lithographed button may fasten with a pinback or with a metal tab which folds over a lapel or pocket. One of the most famous uses of campaign buttons occurred during the 1940 U.S. presidential election, when Wendell Willkie's campaign produced millions of lithographed slogan buttons in rapid response to news items about President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A Barack Obama supporter during the 2008 presidential election Recently, increasing advertising expenses and legal limits on expenditures have led many U.S. campaigns to abandon buttons in favor of disposable lapel stickers, which are much less expensive. Another recent trend is the use of graphical campaign buttons, or \\"web buttons\\", that Internet users can place on their personal websites. Graphical campaign buttons are useful because they can be widely distributed for little cost. However, wider availability of machines for producing celluloid-type buttons (as well as inkjet and laser printers and design software) now permit even small campaigns to produce or acquire buttons relatively inexpensively, even in small quantities. Collecting Campaign button collecting exists as a hobby. The American Political Items Collectors is a non-profit membership organization, dedicated to promoting the collection, preservation and study of materials relating to political campaigns and the presidency. The most valuable example is believed to be a rare campaign button from the 1920 presidential election showing the likenesses of candidate James M. Cox and his running mate Franklin D. Roosevelt.

History Erik van der Luijt started playing the piano at the age of four. He studied jazz piano with Rob van Kreeveld and Rob van Bavel at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, where he participated in master classes with Michel Petrucciani and Barry Harris. His concert performances have taken him to Sweden, France, Belgium, Indonesia, Germany and the United Kingdom. The album The Sweetest Sounds - Ilse Huizinga Sings the Songs of Richard Rodgers (2001), to which he made a major contribution as an arranger, producer and pianist, resulted in his wife Ilse Huizinga's first nomination for Holland's top music award, The Edison Award. In August 2004 he was a finalist at the Deloitte Jazz Award 2004 at the Bimhuis cultural centre in Amsterdam. In the same year he conducted a series of masterclasses in Indonesia, at the invitation of the Conservatory of Rotterdam. In 2004 he also released the privately produced and critically acclaimed album Express Yourself, consisting exclusively of his own compositions and on which he is accompanied by Branko Teuwen on double bass and Victor de Boo on drums. Van der Luijt quotes the fact that two members of the trio had recently married and all three had recently become a father as the drive behind the album. An increased sense of responsibility made them search more than ever for a distinctive style in order to draw more attention to themselves. Three days before the original recording date he decided that recording standards was not the best way to do this and began writing his own compositions. The album Express Yourself was hailed as \\"a masterpiece\\" in the press and compared to landmark albums by Tommy Flanagan and Bill Evans. Involvement for Hurricane Katrina Victims In September 2005 Erik van der Luijt and his trio played at a charity concert at the Concertgebouw to raise funds for New Orleans after the city was hit by Hurricane Katrina. Dutch Jazz for New Orleans also featured performances by Greetje Kauffeld, the Dutch Swing College band, Hans Dulfer, Laura Fygi, Trijntje Oosterhuis, Ramses Shaffy and Louis van Dijk. Style Critics have praised Erik van der Luijt's talent for melody and the classical influences on his work. His style is likened with the subtle cohesion of legendary Bill Evans with his trio of the late 1950s, also in its fresh chord voicings and harmonic phrasing. Others have called him \\"the Dutch Oscar Peterson\\". :Van Der Luijt reflects a bit of a Keith Jarrett influence, particularly when he reaches for some wide gospel chord voicings. Essentially, however, he's his own man, with a muscular, surging swing and a powerful left hand. Van Der Luijt doesn't quite sound like anyone else out there, which is certainly an asset. He's also an engaging, witty composer. - Allaboutjazz.com Collaborations with other artists Erik has contributed as a pianist, arranger and producer to six albums by his wife, the jazz singer Ilse Huizinga. He regularly accompanies and supports singers from various musical disciplines such as Rita Reys, Madeline Bell, Joke Bruijs, Joke de Kruijf, Pia Beck, Denise Jannah, Greetje Kauffeld, Heddy Lester, Gerrie van der Klei, Marjol Flore and Edwin Rutten. As a pianist, arranger and producer Erik has contributed to numerous projects, including the Metropole Orchestra, the Jazz Orchestra of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Ferdinand Povel, Piet Noordijk, Ruud Jacobs, Frits Landesbergen, Bernard Berkhout's Swingmates, the Royal Military Band, the Dutch Swing College Band, musical and cabaret productions and CDs by leading Dutch jazz musicians.

The battalion is based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California and consists of approximately 1,000 Marines and Fleet Marine Force Navy personnel. The 3rd Battalion falls under the command of the 5th Marine Regiment which falls under the command of the 1st Marine Division. Subordinate units * Headquarters and Service Company * Company I (India Company) * Company K (Kilo Company) * Company L (Lima Company) * Weapons Company History =World War I= 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, along with the rest of the 5th Marine Regiment, was first organized on June 8, 1917, as the United States prepared for World War I. The battalion was composed of four companies: the 16th, 20th, 45th and 47th. Six days later, manned by Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Boxer Rebellion veterans along with a large number of raw recruits, they set sail for France. They participated in campaigns and battles such as Bois de Belleau, Vierzy, Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Pont- a-Mousson, Limey Sector, Fleury, Meuse-Argonne, Blanc Mont, St Michiel, Leffincourt and Soissons. The French Government recognized the young battalion by presenting it the Croix de guerre along with the Fourrag√®re and changing the name of a French landmark, Belleau Wood, to \\"Bois de la Brigade de Marine\\" or \\"Wood of the Marine Brigade\\". =Interwar period= In August 1919, the Battalion was deactivated following World War I and less than two years later, in May 1921, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines was reactivated. For the next several years, men of the 3rd Battalion served in the Caribbean and at home, guarding the U.S. Mail. In March 1927, the 3rd Battalion deployed to Nicaragua to help stabilize the government against overthrow attempts by rebel forces. For the next six years, the Battalion aided the Nicaraguan government until peace was finally restored. The job done, the 3rd Battalion was once again disbanded in January 1933. In November 1934, the 3rd Battalion was reactivated for the fourth time, only to be deactivated in March 1935. =World War II= PFC Paul E. Ison, L/3/5, sprints across \\"Death Valley\\" while under heavy fire during the battle of Okinawa. Shortly before World War II in April 1940, 3rd Battalion was again reactivated. The fighting in World War II found the Marines of 3/5 at Guadalcanal, New Britain, Peleliu, and Okinawa. At Peleliu, they were the last Marine battalion to be shipped out before the army took over. In April 1946, their mission accomplished, 3rd Battalion was disbanded and most of the Pacific veterans returned to civilian life. =Korean War= During October 1949, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, was reactivated on Guam. During August 1950, the Battalion deployed to fight against the North Korean army invading the Republic of Korea (South Korea) during the Korean War. The 3rd Battalion fought at such places as the Pusan Perimeter, Inchon, Seoul and Chosin Reservoir. It inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese forces at the Battle of Hwacheon. At the close of hostilities, the 3rd Battalion returned to the United States, settling at MCB Camp Pendleton. The battalion's nickname \\"Darkhorse\\" sprang from the radio call sign of its commander in Korea, Colonel Robert Taplett, who was known as \\"Darkhorse Six\\". =Vietnam War= From April 1966 to March 1971, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, fought in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. They fought in such places as Chu Lai, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Operation Hastings, Operation Union and Union II in the Que Son valley‚Äîreceived a Presidential Unit Citation, the Battle of Hue, An Hoa, Operation Swift in the Que Son Valley‚Äîreceived a second Presidential Unit Citation, and Firebase Ross. During the Vietnam War, the unit motto was \\"consummate professionals\\". =Gulf War and the 1990s= On December 1, 1990, the battalion deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Shield as a Battalion Landing Team, with the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. As part of the largest amphibious task force assembled since Vietnam, the battalion was augmented with mobilized Marine Corps Reserve units from 4th Assault Amphibian Battalion, Tow Platoon, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division, and 4th Tank Battalion. 3/5 distinguished itself in combat operations in Al Wafrah, Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm as Mechanized Combined Arms Task Force. En route home from hostilities, 3/5 participated in Operation Sea Angel, delivering critical food, supplies, and humanitarian assistance to the cyclone ravaged country of Bangladesh. =Iraq War= Marines from 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines and 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines during the Second Battle of Fallujah. 3rd Battalion was deployed for the 2003 invasion of Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein. The Battalion was again deployed in 2004 to capture the city of Fallujah from insurgents' control. In November 2004, the Battalion, along with several other units, participated in Operation Phantom Fury (also known as Al Fajr (Dawn)) and was part of one of the biggest battles in Iraq to that time. On June 20, 2006, seven Marines and a Navy Corpsman of Kilo Company were charged with the April 26, 2006, murder of disabled Iraqi civilian Hashim Ibrahim Awad, an event referred to as the \\"Hamdania incident\\". All eight face additional charges of kidnapping, conspiracy, larceny, assault and housebreaking or unlawfully entering a dwelling. Five of the men are accused of making a false official statement. On May 19, 2006, Darkhorse Marines captured three insurgents responsible for the kidnapping and detention of Jill Carroll, an American journalist with The Christian Science Monitor. In June 2006, Lance Corporal Reginal Dutt lead the vengeance of 3/5 the death of four Scout Snipers who belonged to 2/4 who had been killed on a roof top in Ramadi in 2004. 3/5's mission in Habbaniyah killed the insurgent sniper and driver of a vehicle.

The name fell out of use until 2003; during the training to return to Iraq in 2004, the Battalion Commander, Lt. Col. P. J. Malay, requested use of the \\"Darkhorse\\" call sign as a homage to the battalion's bravery in Korea. The nickname stuck and the 3/5 Marines now use it on their unofficial patches. During the 1980s, the name for the 3rd Battalion was the \\"Mangudai\\", named by then Battalion Commander, Lt. Col. Jack Kelly, who later went on to be promoted to Brigadier General, Commanding Officer of MCRD, San Diego. \\"Mangudai\\" was the name used by the special forces of Genghis Khan.

Colombia‚ÄìUnited States relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Colombia and the United States of America. The relationship between the two states evolved from mutual cordiality during most of the 19th and early 20th centuries to a recent partnership that links the governments of both nations around several key issues; this includes fighting communism, the War on Drugs, and the threat of terrorism due to the September 11 attacks in 2001. During the last fifty years, different American governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the issues already stated. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, claim that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of human rights abuses in Colombia.John Barry, From Drug War to Dirty War: Plan Colombia and the U.S. Role in Human Rights Violations in Colombia, 12 Transnat'l L. & Contemp. Probs. 161, 164 (Spring, 2002). Supporters, such as Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, defend the idea that the United States has promoted respect for human rights and the rule of law in Colombia; in addition, adding to the fight against drugs and terrorism.Marc Grossman.

With the reception of Manuel Torres in 1821, Colombia became the first former Spanish colony recognized by the United States, and the United States was the second government (after the Kingdom of Brazil) to recognize an independent Spanish American state. At that time, Gran Colombia included the territory of the present-day Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Panama. Mutual relations have existed since the U.S. established a diplomatic mission in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1823. The next year the Anderson‚ÄìGual Treaty became the first bilateral treaty the U.S. concluded with another American country. U.S. relations with the government in Bogot√° were not interrupted when Ecuador and Venezuela left the federation in 1830. In 1846, the U.S. Polk administration signed a treaty with Colombia, which owned Panama at the time. A railway across the isthmus was opened in 1855. Under the treaty U.S. troops landed in Panama six times in the nineteenth century to crush rebellions, ensuring that the railway was not hindered.Robert A. Friedlander, A Reassessment of Roosevelt's Role in the Panamanian Revolution of 1903, W. Pol. Q., Jun. 1961, at 538‚Äì539. =Early 20th century= In 1903, the U.S. and Colombia negotiated a new treaty. The representative of the company which owned the railway publicly predicted and threatened that Panama would secede if the Colombian Senate rejected the treaty. In 1903, despite U.S. threats, the Colombian senate refused to ratify the Hay‚ÄìHerr√°n Treaty. The United States encouraged an uprising of historically rebellious Panamanians and then used US warships to impede any interference from Colombia. A representative of the new Panamanian government then negotiated a treaty favorable to the U.S. for the construction and operation of the Panama Canal. In 1928, U.S. business interests were threatened in Colombia. The workers of the U.S. corporation United Fruit banana plantations in Colombia went on strike in December 1928. The workers demanded \\"written contracts, eight-hour days, six-day weeks and the elimination of food coupons\\".United Fruit Historical Society. (last visited Apr. 9, 2006). An army regiment from Bogot√° was brought in by United Fruit to crush the strike. The Colombian soldiers erected their machine guns on the roofs of buildings at the corners of the main square, closing off the access streets. After a five-minute warning, they ordered \\"Fuego!\\", opening fire into a dense crowd of plantation workers and their families who had gathered after Sunday Mass. They waited for an anticipated address from the governor of that region; between forty-seven to 2,000 workers were killed in the Santa Marta Massacre. A populist Colombian congressman, Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, began to develop a nationwide reputation, especially among the poor, after visiting the site of the United Fruit massacre the same week. Gait√°n returned to Bogot√° and argued passionately in Congress in favor of the workers, arguing that the army action's did not protect Colombia's interests but instead those of the U.S. =Mid-20th century= In 1948, presidential candidate Gait√†n was assassinated in Bogot√° during the conference that gave birth the Organization of American States. Gaitan's assassination marked the beginning of La Violencia, a Colombian civil war which lasted until the mid-fifties and killed an estimated 300,000 Colombians. Towards the end of the conflict, Liberal and Communist armed peasant groups who remained at large, together with displaced peasants who had either fled from the violence or lost their land, formed small independent enclaves in the south. According to author Stokes, citing Jenny Pearce, these enclaves had \\"no broader political project\\" other than agriculture and self-protection. The Colombian government, pressured by Conservative Congressmen who defined these enclaves as \\"independent republics\\", saw this as a potential threat. In addition, the U.S. government saw these peasant enclaves as potentially dangerous to US business interests in Colombia. In May 1964, as part of Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, a CIA backed program called Plan LAZO was initiated. The United States trained Colombian military troops to invade the largest peasant enclaves. They used a bomber aircraft with Napalm in order to destroy the threat. Many of the armed inhabitants of the enclaves escaped and two years later part of this group formed the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). The FARC became the oldest and largest revolutionary guerilla movement in the Western Hemisphere.Juan Forero, New Role for U.S. in Colombia: Protecting a Vital Oil Pipeline, New York Times, Oct. 4, 2002, at A1. Stokes and other critics believed that the U.S. government focused on the destruction of the FARC and other left-wing guerrilla movements, ignoring and even supporting other destabilizing elements in Colombian society. 1959 \\"US Special Survey Team\\" and 1962 Plan LAZO As La Violencia was ending a \\"U.S. Special Survey Team\\" composed of worldwide counterinsurgency experts arrived in October 1959 to investigate Colombia's internal security. Among other policy recommendations the US team advised that \\"in order to shield the interests of both Colombian and U.S. authorities against 'interventionist' charges any special aid given for internal security was to be sterile and covert in nature.\\" This recommendation is a form of plausible deniability, common in secret U.S. government documents which are later declassified. In February 1962, three years after the 1959 \\"U.S. Special Survey Team\\", a Fort Bragg top-level U.S. Special Warfare team headed by Special Warfare Center commander General William P. Yarborough visited Colombia for a second survey. In a secret supplement to his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yarborough encouraged a stay-behind irregular force and its immediate deployment to eliminate communists representing a future threat: \\"A concerted country team effort should be made now to select civilian and military personnel for clandestine training in resistance operations in case they are needed later. This should be done with a view toward development of a civil and military structure for exploitation in the event the Colombian internal security system deteriorates further. This structure should be used to pressure toward reforms known to be needed, perform counter-agent and counter-propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents. It should be backed by the United States... If we have such an apparatus in Colombia it should be employed now.\\"Visit to Colombia, South America, by a Team from Special Warfare Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Headquarters, U.S. Army Special Warfare School, 26 Feb. 1962, Kennedy Library, Box 319, National Security Files, Special Group; Fort Bragg Team; Visit to Colombia; 3/62, \\"Secret Supplement, Colombian Survey Report.\\" Interrogation procedures and techniques, including regular questioning of rural villagers \\"who are believed to be knowledgeable of guerrilla activities\\" were advised. \\"Exhaustive interrogation of the bandits, to include sodium pentathol and polygraph, should be used to elicit every shred of information. Both the Army and the Police need trained interrogators.\\" Pentathol, or truth serum, was originally used by doctors for relaxation, but in the 1970s it was reported used by some Latin American militaries to induce \\"paralysis, agony, and terror.\\", quoting, Report of Torture, Amnesty International (Duckworth 1975) at 55‚Äì58. The use of truth serum would later be encouraged in SOA manuals. \\"In general, the Yarborough team recommended that the US provide guidance and assistance in all aspects of counter-insurgency...Civilian and military personnel, clandestinely selected and trained in resistance operations, would be required in order to develop an underground civil and military structure. This organization was to undertake 'clandestine execution of plans developed by the United States Government toward defined objectives in the political, economic, and military fields'...it would‚Ä¶undertake...'paramilitary, sabotage, and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents'.\\" Ultimately Yarborough's recommendations formed the core of a U.S.-aided reorganization of Colombian military troops. This new counter-insurgency policy debuted with Plan LAZO in 1964. Following Yarborough's recommendations, the Colombian military selected and trained civilians to work alongside the military in its counter-insurgency campaign and paramilitary \\"civil defense\\" groups which worked alongside the military. The United States supplied and trained civilian intelligence networks which were closely linked to the military. The system was established to gather \\"intelligence and providing early warning against bandit or guerrilla attacks\\". In 1965 Colombian President Guillermo Le√≥n Valencia Mu√±√≥z issued Decree 3398.Third Report on the Human Rights Situation in Colombia , Inter-Am. C.H.R., OEA/ser. L./V./II.102, doc. 9 rev. 1, 11 (Feb. 26, 1999). Because of the decree, eleven separate civilian intelligence networks had been established with agricultural co-operatives. In 1968, Decree 3398 became Colombia law with the enactment of Law 48 of 1968. Doug Stokes argues that it was not until the early part of the 1980s that the Colombian government attempted to move away from the policy of counterinsurgency warfare represented by Plan LAZO and Yarborough's 1962 recommendations. 1970 US army manual The 1970 U.S. army manual titled \\"Stability Operations\\" was translated into Spanish and used to train thousands of Latin American military officers in counter intelligence, including Colombian officers. Stokes argues that \\"the manual extends its definition of subversion beyond armed insurgents and explicitly links civil society organizations to the problem of insurgency.\\" Targets for Counter intelligence operations included, \\"ordinary citizens who are typical members of organizations or associations which play an important role in the local society.\\"Stability Operations‚ÄîIntelligence, US Dept. of the Army, FM 30-21, 1970 at 43, 73‚Äì74, 77, 78, E1, E1-E7. The manual explains that insurgents usually work with union leaders and union members, and those organizations which demand \\"immediate social, political or economic reform may be an indication that the insurgents have gained a significant degree of control.\\" The manual explains that the indicators of communist/insurgent infiltration include: :Refusal of peasants to pay rent, taxes, or loan payments. Increase in the number of entertainers with a political message. Discrediting the judicial system and police organizations. Characterization of the armed forces as the enemy of the people. Appearance of questionable doctrine in the educational system. Appearance of many new members in established organizations like labor organizations. Increased unrest among laborers. Increased student activity against the government and its police, or against minority groups, foreigners and the like. An increased number of articles or advertisements in newspapers criticizing the government. Strikes or work stoppages called to protest government actions. Increase of petitions demanding government redress of grievances. Proliferation of slogans pinpointing specific grievances. Initiation of letter-writing campaigns to newspapers and government officials deploring undesirable conditions and blaming individuals in power. =Late-20th century= Drug trade Author Doug Stokes claims that there is a major discrepancy between the U.S. \\"stated goals of US policy and the actual targets and effects\\" of the war on drugs in Colombia, arguing that U.S. military assistance has been primarily directed at fighting the FARC and ELN guerrillas despite the fact that past CIA and DEA reports have identified the insurgents as minor players in the drug trade. Stokes proposes a revisionist continuity theory: that the War on drugs is a pre-text and this war, just as the Cold War that preceded it and the War on Terror that followed it, was mainly about Northern Hemisphere competition to control and exploit Southern Hemisphere natural resources. In other words, \\"the maintenance of a world capitalist order conducive to US economic interests.\\" As this competition for third world resources has continued even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there would be continuity in US foreign policy. =1986 RAND, 1992 CIA and 1994 DEA positions= In 1986, the U.S. Defense Department funded a two-year study by the RAND Corporation, a private organization with a long and close relationship with the U.S. government.Robert E. Hunter, Think Tanks: Helping to Shape U.S. Foreign and Security Policy , U.S. Dept. of State International Information Programs. (last modified Mar. 2000). This study found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine trafficking and might in fact raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, \\"Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction,\\" was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts using current armed forces resources would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.Peter H. Reuter, Sealing the borders: the effects of increased military participation in drug interdiction (RAND 1988)Robert E. Kessler, Study: Military Can't Curb Drugs, Newsday, May 23, 1988 at 23Military support would have little effect on drug smuggling, study says, United Press International, Mar. 4 1988. President George Bush Sr. disagreed, arguing that \\"the logic is simple. The cheapest way to eradicate narcotics is to destroy them at their source....We need to wipe out crops wherever they are grown and take out labs wherever they exist.\\"Peter R. Andreas, Dead-End Drug Wars, Foreign Policy, n. 85., Winter, 1991‚Äì1992. During the early- to mid-1990s, the Clinton administration ordered and funded a major cocaine policy study, again by RAND. The Rand Drug Policy Research Center study concluded that $3 billion should be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment. The report said that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use, stating that drug treatment is twenty-three times more effective than the supply-side \\"war on drugs\\".C. Peter Rydell, Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs (Rand Drug Policy Research Center 1994). President Clinton's drug czar's office disagreed with slashing law enforcement spending.Dennis Cauchon, White House balks at study urging more drug treatment, USA Today, Jun. 14, 1994, at 2A. A 1992 Central Intelligence Agency report acknowledged that \\"the FARC had become increasingly involved in drugs through their 'taxing' of the trade in areas under their geographical control and that in some cases the insurgents protected trafficking infrastructure to further fund their insurgency.\\" The report also described the relationship between the FARC and the drug traffickers as one \\"characterized by both cooperation and friction\\".Narco- Insurgent Links in the Andes 8 (Central intelligence Agency July 29, 1992). The 1992 report concluded by stating \\"we do not believe that the drug industry [in Colombia] would be substantially disrupted in the short term by attacks against guerillas. Indeed, many traffickers would probably welcome, and even assist, increased operations against insurgents.\\" In 1994, the DEA came to three similar conclusions. First, that any connections between drug trafficking organizations and Colombian insurgents were \\"ad hoc 'alliances of convinence'\\".Drug Intelligent Report, Insurgent Involvement in the Colombian Drug Trade 16 (Drug Enforcement Administration Jun. 1994). Second, that \\"the independent involvement of insurgents in Colombia's domestic drug productions, transportation, and distribution is limited‚Ä¶there is no evidence that the national leadership of either the FARC or the ELN has directed, as a matter of policy, that their respective organizations directly engage in independent illicit drug production, transportation, or distribution.\\" Third, the report determined that the DEA \\"has no evidence that the FARC or ELN have been involved in the transportation, distribution, or marketing of illegal drugs in the United States. Furthermore it is doubtful that either insurgent group could develop the international transportation and logistics infrastructure necessary to establish independent drug distribution in the United States or Europe‚Ä¶the DEA believes that the insurgents never will be major players in Colombia's drug trade.\\" =2000 AUC participation= In 2000 Former paramilitary leader Carlos Casta√±o Gil, the founder of the AUC who disappeared in 2004,Colombia: AUC chief assassinated, Latinnews Daily, September 21, 2004. revealed on national television how the AUC funded its operations: \\"drug trafficking and drug traffickers probably finance 70%. The rest come largely from extortion.\\"  Counterterrorism  Both before and after September 11, 2001, the US government provided military and economic aid to Colombia for the purposes of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, in addition to its Drug War assistance. In 1999, the US State Department began sharing real-time intelligence about the guerrillas with the Colombian military. Officials told the Washington Post that they feared \\"Colombia is losing its war against Marxist-led insurgents.\\"Douglas Farah, U.S. Widens Colombia Counter-Drug Efforts Restrictions Loosened on Data Sharing, Wash. Post, July 10, 1999 at 1. In May 2001, the Bush administration introduced the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI), which broadened U.S. intervention throughout the entire region, directing another $800 million to the project over Plan Colombia.Hale Sheppard, The Andean Trade Preference Act: Past Accomplishments and Present Circumstances Warrant Its Immediate Renewal And Expansion, 34 Geo. Wash. Int'l L. Rev. 743, 775 (2003). The ARI supplies military support and economic assistance to seven Andean countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.War For Sale at 320. After September 11, 2001, US government officials compared the FARC with Osama Bin Ladin, describing both of them as terrorists. Senator John McCain stated that the United States now \\"abandons any fictional distinctions between counter-narcotic and counter- insurgency operations\\".John McCain, Speech by Senator John McCain (R-Arizona), Center for International Policy. (last modified Jun. 6, 2002). Author Doug Stokes has criticized this, stating that \\"in the aftermath of September 11th the US has dropped the pretence that its military assistance has been driven solely by counter-narcotics concerns and has now started to overtly couch its funding in terms of a strategy of counter-terrorism targeted at the FARC, who are now being linked to international terrorism as well as drug trafficking.\\" In July 2002, \\"the US Congress passed an emergency supplemental spending bill that lifted a previous provision limiting US assistance to counter-narcotics efforts. Under the new rules, U.S. security assistance can be used against 'organizations designated as terrorist organizations...'\\". According to Amnesty International, \\"the new US strategy makes U.S. assistance to Colombia available for counter-insurgency activities for the first time, including direct action against armed groups. The U.S. is now providing military aid for direct use in counter-insurgency operations specifically to protect US operated oil installations, such as Ca√±o Lim√≥n.\\" The spending bill included the U.S. Congress approval of a provision coined as 'expanded authorities,' whereby U.S. supplied training and equipment could be used in counter- terrorism efforts as well as counter-drug efforts. In November 2002, as part of what has been called \\"a significant shift in American policy\\", the US began sending advisors to Colombia under a $94 million counterinsurgency program to protect five hundred miles of an oil pipeline.Juan Forero, New Role for U.S. in Colombia: Protecting a Vital Oil Pipeline, New York Times, Oct. 4, 2002 at A1. In 2006, a U.S. congressional report listed a number of PMCs and other enterprises that have signed contracts to carry out anti-narcotics operations and related activities as part of Plan Colombia. DynCorp was among those contracted by the State Department, while others signed contracts with the Defense Department. Other companies from different countries, including Israel, have also signed contracts with the Colombian Defense Ministry to carry out security or military activities.Private Security Transnational Enterprises in Colombia.

School of the Americas The School of the Americas is a U.S. training center for Latin American military officers, that since its 1946 establishment in Panama, has trained 82,767 Latin American officers in counter-insurgency doctrine and combat skills. Colombia was one of the first countries to send military officers to the SOA. According to journalist Grace Livingstone, as of 2003 more Colombian SOA graduates have been identified as alleged human rights abusers than SOA graduates from any other Latin American country. This is in part because the names and records of Colombian officers have been under greater scrutiny than those of officers elsewhere in Latin America.

Benning school, National Catholic Reporter, Oct 4, 1996 at 1. the U.S. Pentagon declassified translated excerpts from seven training manuals. These manuals were prepared by the U.S. military and used between 1987 and 1991 for intelligence training courses at the U.S. Army School of the Americas. The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals taught counterintelligence agents to use \\"fear, payment of bounties for enemy dead, beatings, false imprisonment, executions and the use of truth serum\\". The manual titled \\"Handling of Sources\\" teaches, \\"The CI [counterintelligence] agent could cause the arrest of the employees [informants] parents, imprison the employee or give him a beating\\" to enforce cooperation. In a 1981 study, human rights researcher Lars Schoultz concluded that US aid \\"has tended to flow disproportionately to Latin American governments which torture their citizens...to the hemisphere's relatively egregious violators of fundamental human rights.\\"Lars Schoultz, U.S. Foreign Policy and Human Rights Violations in Latin America: A Comparative Analysis of Foreign Aid Distributions, Comp. Pol. 13, n. 2, January 1981. In 1998, Latin American professor Martha Huggins stated \\"that the more foreign police aid given (by the United States), the more brutal and less democratic the police institutions and their governments become.\\" =Paramilitaries= In 2003, author Grace Livingstone described Colombian paramilitaries as \\"various types of illegal rightwing armed groups which work alongside the armed forces. They include private militia funded by landowners and business; drug traffickers' hit squads and 'social cleansing' death squads. The largest paramilitary network is the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC).\\" Paramilitaries were considered responsible for three quarters of all Colombian political killings between 1995 and 2001, 52% of the massacres in 1998 (guerrillas were responsible for 20%), and 49% of the refugee displacements in 1999 (guerrillas are responsible for 29%). In 2003, The Guardian's columnist George Monbiot stated that \\"over the past 10 years, the paramilitaries [which the Colombian army] works with have killed some 15,000 trades unionists, peasant and indigenous leaders, human rights workers, land reform activists, leftwing politicians and their sympathizers.\\" The paramilitaries often target union leaders, members of the civil society and human rights workers. On September 28, 2000 the AUC, Colombia's largest paramilitary group, issued a press release stating that \\"the AUC identifies the human rights workers and especially members of Credhos as guerrilla sympathizers, and for this reason from this moment forward we consider them military targets of our organization.\\"Colombia Human Rights Certification II, Wash. Office of Latin America. (last modified at January 2001). US Corporations have also been implicated in the financing of paramilitary groups. The most well known case may be Chiquita Brands International, which has admitted to making payments to the AUC from 1997 to 2004. Due to this involvement with a terrorist organization, Chiquita's board members have even been requested in extradition.Chiquita's Board Members: Total Identification. Jose Alvear Restrepo Lawers' Collective, July 23, 2008, http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1364. 1990 intelligence networks In 1990, the U.S. created a fourteen-member team whose members included representatives of the CIA, the U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Embassy's Military Group, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (produces intelligence for the United States Department of Defense). This was done in order to give advice on the reshaping of several of the Colombian military's local intelligence networks. The stated reason for this restructuring was to aid the Colombian military in their counter-narcotics efforts. Years later, Col. James S. Roach, Jr., who was the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) country liaison and U.S. Military Attache in Bogot√° during the meetings, told Human Rights Watch (HRW) that: \\"The intent [of the meeting] was not to be associated with paramilitaries. But we knew from Colombian news reports and [even] from Colombian military reports that they were still working with paramilitaries.\\" The result of these meetings was Order 200-05/91, which was issued by the Colombian Defense Ministry in May 1991. HRW obtained a copy of the Colombian Armed Forces Directive No. 200-05/91. The report makes no explicit mention of illegal narcotics. The Colombian armed forces, \\"based on the recommendations made by a commission of advisors from the U.S. Armed Forces,\\" presented a plan to better combat \\"escalating terrorism by armed subversion.\\" In 1996, HRW concluded that \\"Order 200-05/91 laid the groundwork for continuing an illegal, covert partnership between the military and paramilitaries and demonstrates that this partnership was promoted by the military high command in violation of [Colombian] Decree 1194, which prohibits such contact. Although the term \\"paramilitaries\\" is not used in the order, the document lays out a system similar to the one present under the name of MAS and its military patrons in the Middle Magdalena.\\" HRW argued that the restructuring process solidified linkages between members of the Colombian military and civilian members of paramilitary groups by incorporating them into several of the local intelligence networks and by cooperating with their activities. For HRW, the resulting situation allowed the Colombian government and military to plausibly deny links or responsibility for human rights abuses committed by members or associates of these networks. HRW considered that the intelligence networks created by the U.S. reorganization appeared to have increased violence, citing massacres in Barrancabermeja as an example. Military-paramilitary links In 1999, a U.S. Department of State annual report stated that \\"government forces continued to commit numerous, serious abuses, including extrajudicial killings, at a level that was roughly similar to that of 1998. Despite some prosecutions and convictions, the authorities rarely brought officers of the security forces and the police charged with human rights offenses to justice, and impunity remains a problem. At times the security forces collaborated with paramilitary groups that committed abuses; in some instances, individual members of the security forces actively collaborated with members of paramilitary groups by passing them through roadblocks, sharing intelligence, and providing them with ammunition. Paramilitary forces find a ready support base within the military and police, as well as local civilian elites in many areas.\\"Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, US Dept. of State, Wash. DC. (last modified 1999). In 1997, Amnesty International (AI) opined that the war on drugs is \\"a myth\\", stating that members of Colombian security forces worked closely with paramilitaries, landlords and narco-traffickers to target political opposition, community leaders, human rights and health workers, union activists, students, and peasants. Amnesty International reported that \\"almost every Colombian military unit that Amnesty implicated in murdering civilians two years ago [1995] was doing so with U.S.-supplied weapons\\"., quoting Amnesty action: The Colombia Papers, Amnesty International, Winter 1997. In 2000, studies carried out by both the United Nations and Human Rights Watch argued that paramilitaries continued to maintain close ties to the Colombian military.The Ties That Bind: Colombia and Military-Paramilitary Links, Human Rights Watch. (last modified Feb. 2000). HRW considered that the existing partnership between paramilitaries and members of the Colombian military was \\"a sophisticated mechanism, in part supported by years of advice, training, weaponry, and official silence by the United States, that allows the Colombian military to fight a dirty war and Colombian officialdom to deny it.\\" A contemporary UN report states that \\"The security forces also failed to take action, and this undoubtedly enabled the paramilitary groups to achieve their exterminating objectives.\\"UN report cited in Martin Hodgson, Bogot√°'s link to far-right militias, Christian Science Monitor, Apr. 26, 2000, at 4. Cooperation System of the American Air Forces Colombia is an active member of the Cooperation System of the American Air Forces (SICOFAA). 1995‚Äì1997 diplomatic crisis Between 1996 and 1997 Bill Clinton's administration decertified Colombia after then President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper was involved in an investigation for allegedly accepting money from drug cartels for his presidential campaign. The media reported Colombia's 'Cuba-nisation' in Washington as United States policy makers constantly called for the isolation of Colombian president Samper. Colombia was officially branded as a 'threat to democracy' and to the United States. Until mid-2004, the U.S. Embassy in Bogota was the largest U.S. embassy in the world.Dana Priest: Covert action in Colombia - Washington Post, December 21, 2013  21st Century  On March 1, 2018, the United States and Colombia decided to continue their partnership that works to better develop and facilitate both countries economies with new opportunities, environmental protection, and efforts to decrease the trade of narcotics. This deal created partnerships between the United States and Colombia that protect Colombia's environment by working to preserve biodiversity, punishing animal traffickers, and limiting illegal gold mining that is destroying Colombia's environment and is harmful to human health. This bilateral agreement also promotes Colombia's economy by creating more job opportunities, funding education and student exchanges, increasing business relations between the two countries by promoting the growth of businesses in Colombia, and encouraging the production of legal crops in Colombia. In this deal the United States also addressees human rights violations in Colombia by carrying out the prosecution of human rights violators. Lastly, it deals with the exchange of narcotics with the agreement to strengthen efforts to eliminate the drug trade by putting in place new restrictions and barriers that will hopefully decrease the cocaine and coca cultivation by 50 in five years.  Interpretations of the U.S Role  Embassy of Colombia in Washington, D.C. According to author Robin Kirk, most Americans remain na√Øve about the role of the United States in Colombia's historical development and the nation's continuing violence.Robin Kirk, More Terrible than Death: Massacres, Drugs, and America's War 6 (Colombia Public Affairs 2003). Colombia's own history has been studied from the perspective of the so-called the \\"violentologist\\", a new type of social scientist created in order to analyze the nature and development of the country's violence. Camilo A. Azcarate has attributed the violence to three main causes: *A weak central state, *Poverty, and an *Elite political system which excludes the less affluent of society.Camilo A. Azcarate, Psychosocial Dynamics of the Armed Conflict in Colombia , Online Journal of Peace and Conflict Resolution. (last modified Mar. 1999). Doug Stokes argues that, along with the other factors, the past and present interference of successive American administrations in Colombian affairs has often sought to preserve a measure of stability in Colombia, by upholding a political and economic status quo understood as favorable to U.S. interests even at the cost of contributing to promoting greater instability for the majority of the population. However, other studies on the influence to Colombian domestic agenda from US military aid have demonstrated controversial results. Different from the stereotypical belief that foreign aid is supposed to strengthen a weak state‚Äôs governing capacity or to lower violence, US‚Äôs military assistance in actuality worsens Colombian‚Äôs domestic violence by introducing higher level of paramilitary attacks as well as decreasing anti narcotics operations. Also, evidence also shows that US aid does not help lower violence related to the production of drug crops such as coca.

The Saxon Shore Way is a long- distance footpath in England. It starts at Gravesend, Kent, and traces the coast of South-East England as it was in Roman times as far as Hastings, East Sussex, in total. This means that around Romney Marsh the route runs significantly inland from the modern coastline. History The line of the Roman fortification that the route traces includes ancient forts, modern towns, nature reserves and coastline: four Roman forts built in the fourth century lie along the route, at Reculver, Richborough, Dover and Lympne. At Seasalter there is an internationally important area for geese, ducks, and waders. The diversity of scenery along the route includes the wide expanses of marshland bordering the Thames and Medway estuaries, the White cliffs of Dover, and panoramic views over Romney Marsh from the escarpment that marks the ancient coastline between Folkestone and Rye. The Saxon Shore Way was originally opened in 1980, but has since been re-established, and in parts re- routed and extended. It follows the coastline of the South East as it was about 1500 years ago, long before the North Kent Marshes or the Romney Marsh came into existence, when the cliff lines to the north and south extended further into the sea and when the Wantsum Channel provided a thoroughfare for boats between the Isle of Thanet and mainland England. The Way takes its name, the Saxon Shore, from a line of fortifications built along the coastline as it was in the 3rd century AD, towards the end of the Roman period. In this time of crisis Saxon invaders came from the southern regions of modern Denmark and in response the Romans built a line of defensive forts along the coast to repel the newcomers.

In 1948 Claude Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication article in two parts in the July and October numbers of the Bell System Technical Journal. (July, October) In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener, which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing what became known as the dominant form of information theory. The 1949 book co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 article under the name The Mathematical Theory of Communication and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. In short, Weaver reprinted Shannon's two-part paper, wrote a 28-page introduction for a 144-page book, and changed the title from \\"A Mathematical Theory‚Ä¶\\" to \\"The Mathematical Theory‚Ä¶\\". Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise, a popular introduction for non-specialists. The term Shannon‚ÄìWeaver model was widely adopted in social science fields such as education, communication sciences, organizational analysis, psychology, etc. At the same time, it has been subject to much criticism in the social sciences, as it is supposedly \\"inappropriate to represent social processes\\"\\"Global communications : opportunities for trade and aid\\" U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment.

Segmented mirrors are typically hexagonal and arranged in a honeycomb pattern. A segmented mirror is an array of smaller mirrors designed to act as segments of a single large curved mirror. The segments can be either spherical or asymmetric (if they are part of a larger parabolic reflectorW. Patrick McCray - Giant telescopes - Page 107). They are used as objectives for large reflecting telescopes. To function, all the mirror segments have to be polished to a precise shape and actively aligned by a computer-controlled active optics system using actuators built into the mirror support cell. The concept and necessary technologies were initially developed under the leadership of Dr. Jerry Nelson at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California during the 1980s, and have since spread worldwide to the point that essentially all future large optical telescopes plan to use segmented mirrors. Application SALT's segmented mirror There is a technological limit for primary mirrors made of a single rigid piece of glass. Such non-segmented, or monolithic mirrors can not be constructed larger than about eight meters in diameter. The largest monolithic mirror in use are currently the two primary mirrors of the Large Binocular Telescope, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. The use of segmented mirrors is therefore a key component for large-aperture telescopes. Using a monolithic mirror much larger than 5 meters is prohibitively expensive due to the cost of both the mirror, and the massive structure needed to support it. A mirror beyond that size would also sag slightly under its own weight as the telescope was rotated to different positions, changing the precision shape of the surface. Segments are also easier to fabricate, transport, install, and maintain over very large monolithic mirrors. Segmented mirrors do have the drawback that each segment may require some precise asymmetrical shape, and rely on a complicated computer-controlled mounting system. All of the segments also cause diffraction effects in the final image. Telescopes using segmented mirrors James Webb Space Telescope primary mirror assembly Some of the largest optical telescopes in the world use segmented primary mirrors. These include, but are not limited to the following telescopes: * Keck Telescopes :The twin telescopes are the most prominent of the Mauna Kea Observatories at an elevation of 4,145 meters (13,600 ft) near the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, United States. Both telescopes feature primary mirrors. * Hobby-Eberly Telescope : The HET is a 9.2-meter (30-foot) telescope located at the McDonald Observatory, West Texas at an altitude of 2,026 m (6,647 ft). Its primary mirror is constructed from 91 hexagonal segments. The telescope's main mirror is fixed at a 55 degree angle and can rotate around its base. A target is tracked by moving the instruments at the focus of the telescope; this allows access to about 70‚Äì81% of the sky at its location and a single target can be tracked for up to two hours. * Southern African Large Telescope :The SALT is a 10-meter telescope dedicated on spectroscopy for most of its observing time. It shares similarities with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and also consists of 91 hexagonal mirror segments, each 1 meter across, resulting in a total hexagonal mirror of 11.1 m by 9.8 m. It is located close to the town of Sutherland in the semi-desert region of the Karoo, South Africa. It is a facility of the South African Astronomical Observatory, the national optical observatory of South Africa. * Gran Telescopio Canarias :Also known as the GranTeCan, the Canaries Great Telescope uses a total of 36 segmented mirrors.Tests begin on Canaries telescope BBC 14 July 2007Giant telescope begins scouring space 14 July 2007 With a primary mirror of , it is currently the world's largest optical telescope, located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, in the Canary Islands in Spain. * LAMOST :The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope is a survey telescope located in the Hebei Province of China.

History Nathaniel Nicoll formed Doctors With Knives with Mike Hayden after the singer for a prior band called \\"left unexpectedly.\\" After a number of limited releases, Nicoll formed the then solo project B! Machine primarily as a result of scheduling conflicts resulting from Nicoll's college and graduate school schedule and penchant for spending months of the year living overseas. B!

In 1999, they released the full-length CD \\"Infinity Plus\\" which featured production by Jarkko Touhimaa of Neuroactive. Infinity Plus, which spawned the singles Temple and Opal, was well received and established B! Machine's reputation as a distinctively analog-driven type of electronic music. In August 2016, the B!

Nicknamed Geronimo, it falls under the command of the 5th Marine Regiment and the 1st Marine Division. The battalion was formed in 1914 and has served in every major conflict that the United States has been involved in since then. Subordinate units *Apache Company *Blackfoot Company *Cherokee Company *WhiteHorse Company *Huron Company History On 13 July 1914, the battalion was formed at Vera Cruz, Mexico, and sailed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for service in the Caribbean theatre. The battalion was disbanded upon their return to Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 December 1914. =World War I= On 25 May 1917, the battalion was activated and deployed to France on 1 June 1917. 1/5 participated in the following World War I campaigns: Aisne, Aisen-Marne, St. Mihiel, Meuse- Argonne, Toulon-Troyon, Chateau-Thierry, Marabache, and Limey. 1/5 made its most notable contribution at the Battle of Belleau Wood on 6 June 1918, when it conducted the first offensive actions of the battle in seizing Hill 142. The battalion, at first with only two companies due to the other companies not being relieved in time, assaulted the open wheat fields of the hill with bayonets fixed under the fire of German machine gun and artillery fire. In a battle that claimed 325 1/5 lives, Gunnery Sergeant Ernest A. Janson became the first Marine to earn the Medal of Honor in World War I. From December 1918 to July 1919, the battalion participated in the occupation of the German Rhineland. It then re-deployed to Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia and de- activated in August 1919. In July 1920 the battalion re-activated to provide security for the U.S. Mail. In March 1927, the Battalion deployed to help stabilize the government of Nicaragua against overthrow attempts by rebel forces. For the next six years, they aided the Nicaraguan government until peace was finally restored. 1/5 was deactivated in January 1933. Shortly thereafter the battalion was re-activated in September 1934 in Quantico, Virginia and served in the Caribbean theatre until the outbreak of World War II. =World War II= In November 1934, the 1st Battalion was reactivated for the fourth time, only to be deactivated in March 1935. Shortly before World War II in April 1940, 1st Battalion was again reactivated. The fighting in World War II found the Marines of 1st Battalion at Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Peleliu, and Okinawa. At Peleliu, the 1st Battalion assaulted the island alongside the rest of the 1st Marine Division under Major General William H. Rupertus, fighting primarily to secure the island's airstrip and prevent interference with the Allied offensive in the Philippines. Landing at Orange Beach 1 and Orange Beach 2 on D-Day, September 15, 1944, the 1st Battalion would gain notoriety for the total destruction of an attempted Japanese tank- infantry counterattack. This costly maneuver of Japanese tanks and a company- sized infantry element would be the sole instance of open Japanese maneuver during the months-long Battle of Peleliu.Hough USMC, Major F. O. (2013-08-13). Marines in World War II - The Assault on Peleliu [Illustrated Edition] (Kindle Locations 1246-1250). Pickle Partners Publishing. Kindle Edition. In April 1946, their mission accomplished, 1st Battalion was disbanded and most of the Pacific veterans returned to civilian life. =Cold War= Korean War During October 1949, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines was reactivated in Camp Pendleton, California. During August 1950, the Battalion deployed to fight the Communist force invading the Republic of Korea. Names such as the Pusan Perimeter, Inchon, Seoul and Chosin Reservoir were added to the Battalion's battle vocabulary. At the close of hostilities, the 1st Battalion returned to the United States, settling at Camp Pendleton. Vietnam War Leader of the 1st squad, 3rd Platoon, Company C, 1/5 Marines, runs under Viet Cong fire during Operation Tippecanoe, 14‚Äì16 March 1967 From June 1966 to March 1971, 1/5 was deployed to South Vietnam. The battalion participated in action around Chu Lai, Danang, Quang Nam, Que Son Valley, Hoi An, Phu Loc and An Hoa. The unit was deactivated in June 1974, but once again was quickly reactivated in March 1975. The battalion played a major role in the Battle of Hue during February 1968. Engaging the enemy in the famous Citadel on the north side of the Perfume River, the battalion became known as the \\"Citadel Battalion\\". =Persian Gulf War and the 1990s= MCB Twentynine Palms in 1985 From 1987 to 1989, The battalion supported Operation Prime Chance in the Persian Gulf. In August 1990, the battalion returned to the Southwest Asia in support of Operation Desert Shield, and subsequently took part in combat operations in Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. The battalion formed the left half of the mechanized Task Force Ripper, along with 1st Battalion 7th Marines, Alpha Company 1st Tank Battalion, Alpha Company 3rd Tank Battalion, HQ 7th Marines and Delta Company, 3rd Light Armored Infantry Battalion. They were supported by Alpha and Delta Companies of the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion and a platoon from Charlie Company, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion. The task force was commanded by Colonel Carlton W. Fulford, Jr. and saw considerable combat as it pushed into Kuwait, seized Al Jaber Airfield and consolidated with other Marine forces at Kuwait International Airport of 27 February 1991. Following the cease fire, the task force backloaded to Manifeh Bay and departed Saudi Arabia on 8 March. The battalion returned to Camp Pendleton the following day. =Global War on Terror= Marines from A/1/5 engage insurgents in Fallujah during Operation Vigilant Resolve on 7 April 2004. Marines with A/1/5 peer over a building top to fix enemy targets in Al Fallujah, Iraq 7 April 2004. The battalion deployed to Kuwait in 2003 to become part of the invasion force that ousted Saddam Hussein. The Marines of 1/5 were the first to enter the country beginning combat operations the day prior to the war beginning. The battalion continued north in the coming weeks before ultimately participating in the battle for Baghdad. They returned again to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in early 2004 for security and stabilization operations in Al Anbar Province. In March 2004, the battalion, this time attached to the 1st Marine Regiment along with several other units, participated in Operation Vigilant Resolve in the restive city of Fallujah. They were deployed a third time in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, one of only two Marine Corps infantry battalions to do so at the time, in the city of Ar Ramadi, capital of Al Anbar Province between March and October 2005. 1/5 deployed to Afghanistan from May to December 2009 as part of Task Force Leatherneck and conducted combat operations in the Nawa-I-Barakzayi District of Helmand province. 1/5 was once more deployed to Afghanistan from March to October 2011 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF to the Sangin District of Helmand Province. During this time they took part in two separate combat operations. Upon completing this rotation they were awarded with the Navy Meritorious Unit Citation award. =Other operations= In November 2012, 1/5 deployed as a Battalion Landing Team (BLT) as part of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. 1/5 completed a six-month rotation including a deployment to Thailand in support of exercise Cobra Gold 2013. The Battalion was relieved by fellow 5th Marines Battalion 2/4 and returned to Camp Pendleton in late May 2013, completing a six-month rotation including a deployment to the Kingdom of Thailand in support of exercise Cobra Gold 2013. From March 2014 to October 2014, 1/5 deployed to Darwin, Australia as the ground combat element of Marine Rotational Force-Darwin. This was the third rotation of Marines to Robertson Barracks, but 1/5 was the first battalion-sized element to deploy to Australia in recent history. The battalion's presence was the first high-visibility example of the United States' \\"pivot to the Pacific.\\" In November 2015, 1/5 again formed BLT 1/5 in support of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit In July 2017, 1/5 Deployed as the 15th Marine Expeditionary units (MEU) Battalion Landing Team (BLT).

It is first found in Lanarkshire, where the family had been settled since ancient times. The name has also been variously spelled Ballantyne, Bannatyne, Ballanden. Origin of the name In his book The Clans, Septs, and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands (1908), Sir Thomas Innes Learney states that the original family name was Bannatyne, and was a sept associated with both Clan Campbell and Clan Stuart of Bute. In the Fourth Edition (1952) of that book, the Bannatyne association with Clan Campbell is stated to have begun in 1538, formalized in a bond signed May 10, 1547, in which the Chief of the MacAmelynes (aka Bannatynes) and Sir John Stuart, ancestor of the Marquis of Bute, engaged to stand by and support each other against all persons except the King and the Earl of Argyll, the latter reservation made so that the Chief of the Bannatynes couldfulfill the conditions of a bond of manrent give to the Early of Argyll, dated April 14, 1538. The etymology, given in William Arthur's An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names with an Essay on their Derivation and Import (1857), derives the name from Bal, the name of a deity, and teine, meaning fire, and relating to a place where Belenus, or Bal, was worshiped by the Celts.

The taxonomic order Rhynchonellida is one of the two main groups of living articulate brachiopods, the other being the order Terebratulida. They are recognized by their strongly ribbed wedge-shaped or nut-like shells, and the very short hinge line. The hinges come to a point, a superficial resemblance to many (phylogenetically unrelated) bivalve mollusk shells. The loss of the hinge line was an important evolutionary innovation, rhynchonellids being the first truly non-strophic shells with a purely internal articulation (teeth-sockets). Strong radiating ribs are common in this group; and there are generally very strong plications or accordion-like folds on the sulcus (the long middle section) of the shell. This probably helps regulate the flow of water in and out of the shell. All rhynchonellids are biconvex (have a bulbous shell), and have a fold located in the brachial valve. This means that the commissure, the line between the two valves or shells, is zigzagged, a distinguishing characteristic of this group. The prominent beak of the pedicle valve usually overlaps that of the brachial valve, in order to allow the shell to open and close. There is usually a functional pedicle although the delthyrium may be partially closed. Morphologically, the rhynchonellid has changed little since its appearance during the Ordovician period. It seems to have evolved from pentamerids, and in turn gave rise to the first atrypids and athyrids, both of which are characterized by the development of a complex spiral brachidium. Although much diminished by the terminal Paleozoic extinction, it experienced a revival during the Early Jurassic period, and became the most abundant of all brachiopods during the Mesozoic Era.

The book contains thirteen ghost stories from the U.S. state of Alabama. The book was the first in a series of seven Jeffrey books, most featuring ghost stories from a Southern state. Jeffrey in the book's title refers to a ghost that allegedly haunts Windham's home. Origins of the book and Jeffrey The foreword of the book describes how Windham came to be interested in ghost stories. It began with ghostly incidents in the Windham family home in Selma that Windham attributed to a spirit she dubbed \\"Jeffrey\\". At first, the family heard footsteps in rooms that would later be found empty. A supposed photograph of Jeffrey, included in the book, was taken inside the home. On the night the picture was made, some young people visiting the house decided to play with a Ouija board, trying to contact Jeffrey. When they developed the photos taken that night, a shadowy vaguely human-like shape was seen beside a girl in the photograph. Soon after it was taken Windham contacted , who was a noted collector of ghost stories, to ask about Jeffrey. Out of that meeting, the idea of 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey was born. In the preface to the book, Windham says that although there are many ghost stories in Alabama, she wanted to choose stories for her book that had \\"entertained many generations\\" and were \\"a treasured part of Southern folklore\\". Windham sought stories from which she could describe not only the ghost, but also the community and lifestyles of the people who first reported the haunting. Windham spends as much time describing the people and places around the ghost stories as she does the ghost itself. Stories included * The Ghost of the Angry Architect * Death Lights in the Tower * The Faithful Vigil at Carlisle Hall * The Specter in the Maze at Cahaba * The Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee * The Unquiet Ghost at Gaineswood * The Face in the Courthouse Window * Mobile's Pipe-Smoking Captain * The Return of the Ruined Banker * The Hole That Will Not Stay Filled * Huntingdon College's Red Lady * The Crying Spirit at the Well * The Dancing Ghost of Grancer Harrison Controversy Despite being very popular in Alabama, the book attracted some controversy from certain Christians in the state who said that the book promoted beliefs incompatible with Christianity. In fact, Windham said that she had received letters from people telling her she is doomed to hell for writing the Jeffrey books. In an interview with The Birmingham News, Windham responded to these claims, saying \\"If I'm going to hell ‚Äî and I can't deny that, because it's not for me to judge ‚Äî it won't be for telling ghost stories; I have far greater shortcomings than that.\\" Adaptations 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey has been adapted into a stage musical by Don Everett Garrett and Kevin Francis Finn. Kathryn Tucker Windham gave her blessing for the adaptation and saw the premiere at Red Mountain Theatre Company's Cabaret Theatre in October 2010, prior to her death. The musical is now available to schools and arts organizations from the authors.

Together with other similar-sized non-copepod fresh-water crustaceans, especially cladocera, they are commonly called water fleas. The name Cyclops comes from the Cyclops of Greek mythology which shares the quality of having a single large eye, which may be either red or black in Cyclops. Nauplius larva of Cyclops  Anatomy  Cyclops individuals may range from ¬Ω‚Äì5 mm longReed & McIntyre (1995). Cyclops strenuus (Fischer, 1851) sensu lato in Alaska and Canada, with new records of occurrence and are clearly divided into two sections. The broadly oval front section comprises the head and the first five thoracic segments. The hind part is considerably slimmer and is made up of the sixth thoracic segment and the four legless pleonic segments. Two caudal appendages project from the rear. Although they may be difficult to observe, Cyclops has 5 pairs of legs. The long first antennae, 2 in number, are used by the males for gripping the females during mating. Afterwards, the female carries the eggs in two small sacs on her body. The larvae, or nauplii, are free-swimming and unsegmented.  Habitat  Cyclops has a cosmopolitan distribution in fresh water, but is less frequent in brackish water. It lives along the plant-covered banks of stagnant and slow-flowing bodies of water, where it feeds on small fragments of plant material, animals (such as nematodes), or carrion. It swims with characteristic jerky movements. Cyclops has the capacity to survive unsuitable conditions by forming a cloak of slime. Average lifespan is about 3 months.  Public health importance  Cyclops is intermediate host of dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) and fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) infection. = Control methods= Cyclops can be controlled using physical, chemical, biological and engineering methods.  Physical  Straining of water through piece of fine cloth is sufficient to remove Cyclops. It can also be killed by boiling water, as it is easily killed by heat at 60 ¬∞C.  Chemical  Chlorine destroys Cyclops in strength of 22 ppm in 2 hours;https://militaryhealth.bmj.com/content/jramc/45/4/251.full.pdf although this concentration of chlorine gives bad odour and taste to water. Excess chlorine can be removed with Sodium thiosulfate. Calcium hydroxide at dosage of 4 gram per gallon of water can be used. Temefos kills cyclops at concentration of 1 mg/litre.  Biological  Small fish like barbel and Gambusia feed on Cyclops. This type of predation was used in Indian state of Karnataka to eradicate dracunculiasis.  Engineering  Provision of drinking water through piping water supply, use of tubewells and abolition of stepwells are effective measures on community level.

Three Neolithic long barrows are known within the parish boundaries, as well as the sites of over twenty Bronze Age bowl barrows.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 283, retrieved 12 October 2011 At Knoll Camp, there is also the site of an Iron Age Hill fort with a single bank and ditch.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 284, retrieved 12 October 2011 At West Park, Rockbourne Roman Villa has been excavated since the 1950s, revealing over 70 rooms, several with mosaic floors and hypocausts.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 285, retrieved 12 October 2011 The collection of finds from the site have been housed permanently in the museum building on the site, which is the only villa site in Hampshire open to the public. The name Rockbourne, recorded as Rocheborne in 1086, may derive from Old English \\"Hrocaburna\\", Rooks' stream,Rockbourne, Old Hampshire Gazetteer or perhaps Rocky stream. In the earliest records Rockbourne was a royal manor. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Alwy son of Turber held a hide there which Wulfgeat had previously held of King Edward.Domesday Map ‚Äì Rockbourne Saewin also held half a hide of the gift of King Edward, to which the sheriff in 1086 made an unsuccessful claim as part of the king's farm, but which at a later date reverted to the Crown. Alwy was succeeded here as in Hale and Tytherley by the Cardenvilles, and in the 13th century William Cardenville held a free tenement in Rockbourne. Before 1156 the manor had been granted to Baron Manser Bisset. He was succeeded before 1177 by a son Henry, and whose widow Iseuld was holding Rockbourne early in the next century. Their eldest son William died c. 1220, and was succeeded by his brother John, who died in 1241. Rockbourne passed to his daughter Ela, and then to her son John who assumed his mother's surname. He died in 1307, leaving a son John, who died unmarried in 1334, leaving the manor to his sister Margaret, at that time the wife of Robert Martin, on whom the manor was settled in 1338. Early in 1336 Robert Martin complained that a certain John de Crucheston (Crux Easton) and others had abducted Margaret his wife and taken away his goods. Not waiting for justice, he retaliated by breaking into the house of John de Crucheston and seizing his property. Some years later he took Crucheston prisoner, torturing him \\"with cords tied round his head and other torments, and extorting ¬£1,150 from his friends for his release.\\" Robert Martin died in 1355, his wife surviving him until 1373, when the manor passed to her eldest son by her first husband, Sir Walter de Romsey. It then passed by inheritance into the Keilway family, it being held by John Keilway on his death in 1547. His son Francis died in 1601‚Äì2, and his son Thomas succeeded to Rockbourne, which, already heavily mortgaged to Sir Anthony Ashley, he sold in 1608 to Sir Anthony's son-in-law, Sir John Cooper. Sir John Cooper was succeeded by his eldest son Anthony Ashley Cooper, created Earl of Shaftesbury in 1672, and the manor descended with the Earls of Shaftesbury. The nearby manor of Rockstead, which Aldwin held before 1066, belonged to Hugh de Port in 1086.Domesday Map ‚Äì Rockstead Rockstead had passed to Breamore Priory before 1291. It belonged to the priory at the Dissolution and was granted with its other possessions to Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter and Gertrude his wife in November 1536. Escheating to the Crown in 1539, it was granted to Anne of Cleves, but in 1548 passed to Sir Thomas Henneage and William Lord Willoughby, who in the following year sold it to William Keilway. After this date it followed the descent of Rockbourne and became merged in that manor, its name only surviving in Rockstead Farm. Rockbourne Roman Villa Rockbourne Roman villa once stood in the centre of a large farming estate, and is the largest known villa in the area.Rockbourne Roman Villa Its history spans the period from the Iron Age to the 5th century. The villa included bath houses, living quarters, farm buildings and workshops. Much of the villa is on public display and there is a site museum, with excavated artefacts, tracing the villa's history. Saint Andrew's church The 11th/12th-century church of Saint Andrew is a flint structure with a tiled roof, and a timber and wood tiled belfry. Originally cruciform, it bears the remains of an 11th-century Saxon north door and north transept arch. The church was enlarged in the 13th, 16th and 17th centuries. There is a 14th- century chantry chapel restored in the 19th century.

He was the first person born in Upper Canada to serve in its Legislative Assembly. He was born in Charlottenburgh Township in 1788, the son of a United Empire Loyalist who settled on the Raisin River. The settlement that formed around his father's mills was first known as MacMartin's Mills and later Martintown. McMartin served with the Glengarry militia during the War of 1812 and the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1838. He was elected to the 6th Parliament of Upper Canada in 1812 representing Glengarry and represented the county until 1824. During the 1820s, McMartin took over the mill operations. In 1827, with a partner, he took on a contract to clear land for a section of the Rideau Canal. As the project proceeded, he found that their costs were going to be much greater than the value of the bid. Despite verbal assurances from Colonel John By, he was not compensated for his losses on the project. In 1828, he was elected again as Glengarry's representative and served until 1834.

He then played for the New South Wales Waratahs in the Super Rugby competition. Tahu returned to the NRL with the Eels and then the Penrith Panthers before finishing his NRL career where it started with the Newcastle Knights.  Background  Tahu was born in Melbourne of a New Zealand MƒÅori father and an Australian Aboriginal mother, as a result he was eligible for both the New Zealand Kiwis and Australian Kangaroos.Coffey and Wood The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League He grew up in St Kilda before moving with his mother to Bourke in western New South Wales at the age of 12. From there he went on to live in towns including Wilcannia, Grafton and Byron Bay. Tahu and his partner Kasey have three children. They met while young; their oldest child was born when he was 18.  Rugby league career  =Newcastle Knights (1999‚Äì2004)= Tahu made his first grade debut in Round 12 1999 against South Sydney at the Sydney Football Stadium. In the 2000 season, Tahu scored 20 tries in 26 games as Newcastle reached the preliminary final against the Sydney Roosters. Tahu scored a try during the match which Newcastle lost 26-20. Tahu played in the Knights 2001 premiership side, scoring a try that cemented the victory as Newcastle defeated Parramatta 30-24. The grand final victory has been described as one of the greatest grand final upsets as Parramatta went into the game as raging hot favourites and had only lost 4 games all season. Tahu scored 82 tries in 97 games during his first spell with the club. = Parramatta Eels (2005-07)= Tahu in 2005 In 2004, Tahu announced that he had signed a 3-year contract to join the Eels.https://www.smh.com.au/sport/marsh-signs-to-eels- cayless-to-re-sign-20040902-gdjnvf.html In 2005, Tahu was part of the Parramatta side which won the minor premiership.

Tahu's contract with Parramatta ended at the end of the 2007 NRL season after three seasons in the Eels. The contract with the Waratahs was expected to be a four-year deal.Timana prepares to be 'bored'  Rugby union career  = Waratahs (2008-09)= In 2007, Tahu shocked the NRL when he announced that he had decided to move to rugby union. His contract with the Eels was set to expire at the end of the year, thus the NSW Waratahs attempted to sign him. On 19 December 2007, Tahu agreed to a four-year contract with Shute Shield club, West Harbour. He joined fellow League convert Lote Tuqiri at the club. In Tahu's final game in the NRL, he was put on report for a head slam on Melbourne Storm player Israel Folau.http://www.nzwarriors.co.nz/news.php?newsid=14840 He received a two- match suspension, and although his rugby league career was over this suspension still carried across into rugby union.

Tahu made his debut performance in the Super 14 competition in the Waratahs clash with the Wellington Hurricanes on 16 February 2008. =Wallabies and Australia A= During the 2008 Pacific Nations Cup, Tahu repeatedly performed for Australia A, playing at both wing and inside centre. His performance against Tonga at North Sydney Oval, in front of new Wallabies coach Robbie Deans, in which he played at inside centre, caused him to declare that inside centre is his preferred position. Here he scored a try and made six assists, tearing the opposition defence apart. He also scored the winning try against the Samoans, with a long distance intercept effort. On 6 July Tahu played a pivotal role in the Australian A's final Pacific Nations Cup game against New Zealand Maori, scoring 2 tries. On 7 July 2008, Tahu was named in the 30 man Wallabies squad for the Tri-Nations series.http://www.rugby.com.au/news/wallabies_2008/tri- nations_squad_announced,95528.html/section/21893 On 26 July, Tahu made his first appearance as a substitute for the Wallabies against New Zealand in the Tri-Nations.

He ended his career with league when in 2007, he signed a nearly $2 million, four-year contract with the ARU and NSW Waratahs.Timana Tahu returning to NRL with Parramatta In 2010, Tahu earned a recall to the New South Wales State of Origin team and was involved in a race-related incident with assistant coach Andrew Johns. In New South Wales Blues training, Johns reportedly called Greg Inglis \\"a black cunt\\". Tahu withdrew in protest from the New South Wales Origin team.http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=1068961http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=1068899 It is believed Johns made the racial slur at a team bonding session. Johns was reported as telling centre Beau Scott he needed to stop Greg Inglis, and made a racial reference to the Maroons Aboriginal star. Tahu's mother is Aboriginal. Tahu ended his season by playing for the New Zealand MƒÅori against England. After the tumultuous 2010 season, Tahu requested an extended break from the Eels pre-season training, hoping to return in January 2011. New coach Stephen Kearney denied the request and Tahu was released from his contract. After a period where it seemed possible Tahu would not return to the NRL, Tahu was signed by the Penrith Panthers. Tahu played just 7 games for the Panthers in 2011 before a torn pectoral muscle ended his season. Only a week later it was announced Tahu would be returning to his original club, the Newcastle Knights on a 2-year contract starting from 2012. Tahu playing for the Knights On 6 September 2013, Tahu re-signed with the Knights on a 1-year contract.

It is located in the locality of Barron Gorge in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area north-west of Cairns. It replaced an earlier station which was the first underground power station in the country and the first hydroelectric station in Queensland. The power station was refurbished in 2006. History The conceptualisation for construction of a hydroelectric power station on the Barron River was first suggested in 1906. It was nearly 30 years before completion was realised. The 3.8 MW plant was the first underground power station in Australia and supplied the Cairns area with electricity for 28 years. The site presented many challenges including precipitous cliffs, torrential rain, and raging floods. During the initial construction phase the delivery of equipment was complex. It first came by train to a rail siding, was transferred over the falls and then lowered by tramway to the work site below. Hauling equipment from Cairns was relatively easy. There was no road in the early 1930s but there was the railway on the opposite bank. Getting across the gorge was another matter. A flying fox was constructed to solve that problem. A weir was built in 1935, to even out seasonal variations in flow. A fragile bridge was also constructed across the top of the Barron Falls, however this failed to withstand the floods. Plans to build an outdoor station were abandoned as earthworks proved too unstable. Going underground proved relatively easy following construction of the tramway down the near vertical cliff-face. In November 1935, the Governor of Queensland, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, officially opened Barron Gorge, Queensland's first hydroelectric power station. Demand for power soon exceeded supply and in 1940 the two turbo alternators were supplemented by a unit. The original site was largely dismantled and decommissioned in 1959 and the present Barron Falls power station was commissioned in 1963 further down stream. A new, larger power station was needed to supply the rapidly growing demand in north Queensland. Construction of the new power station began on 6 October 1960 and it was expected to cost ¬£2,055,000. The weir was raised for the new power station. Water enters a concrete intake tower and then flows through a wide horizontal tunnel for . It then flows downwards for along an angled tunnel for before branching into two distribution pipes leading to the turbines. Site Barron Falls is, visually, an impressive gash in the forest and rock. From the far upstream (Kuranda) end of the station, a white seam of quartz can be seen in the rock at the distant downstream end of the gorge. Along this is a small dark hole, which was the power station's waste water outlet and is about 10 feet tall. Refurbishment In 2003 Stanwell Corporation Limited developed a $28 million strategic plan to extend the life of Barron Gorge Hydro for 40 years. Phase one was completed in 2006 and included a mid-life refit, upgrading the majority of the originally installed electrical plant. This was the largest project undertaken at the power station since its original construction. Phase two of the program consisted of the refurbishment of both the hydro‚Äôs generators. Unit 1 generator was refurbished in 2009, and Unit 2 in 2011. The generator refurbishment project improved the reliability and efficiency of the generating units as well as increased the maximum electrical output capacity of Barron Gorge Hydro.

It was inserted into the canton of the Swedish and Norwegian national flags from 1844 to denote the partnership of the two countries in a personal union. The mark combined the flag colours of both kingdoms, equally distributed, to reflect their equal status within the union. The stand-alone design of the mark was used for the diplomatic flag and the naval jack of the union. The union mark remained part of the flags of both countries until it was removed from the merchant and state flags of Norway in 1899 because of increasing Norwegian dissatisfaction with the union. It remained on the naval ensign of Norway and all Swedish flags until the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.  Background  The Union of Sweden and Norway came about as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, when the king of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, on the losing side, was forced to cede Norway to the king of Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. Norwegian resistance led to the declaration of national independence and the adoption of a constitution on 17 May 1814. A brief war with Sweden resulted in the Convention of Moss on 14 August 1814 and the Norwegian constitutional revision of 4 November 1814 to open the way for a personal union. On the same day, the Norwegian parliament chose to elect Charles XIII of Sweden as King of Norway. According to the constitution of November 1814, Norway was to have its own merchant flag, but the war flag was to reflect the union. The present flag of Norway was introduced in 1821, but its use was restricted. The union war flag of 1815 was a Swedish flag defaced with a canton showing a white saltire on red, meant to represent Norway. Public opinion in Norway saw this situation as unsatisfactory, and demanded a reform of flags and arms to reflect the equal status of the two states within the union.Nev√©us, Clara (1994). \\"Vapen och flaggor under den svensk-norska unionens tid\\".

It was placed in the canton of each flag, including the merchant flags, which had until then been without any symbols of the union. The two countries received separate, but parallel flag systems, clearly manifesting their equality. The union mark on its own was used as the naval jack in both countries, and as the flag of the common diplomatic representations of both countries abroad. The diplomatic flag had the proportions 4:5 of the union mark as it appeared in Swedish flags, unlike the square shape of the Norwegian version.Anker, C.J.

Swedish flags before 1905 also had a darker shade of blue than present flags. The union mark was at first popular in Norway as a sign of Norway's equal status in the union. In Sweden, it was always seen by some people as a desecration of their flag, and one of its adversaries called it \\"the herring salad\\"This nickname was first used by the Swedish representative C.O. Brakel during a debate in the Swedish House of Nobility in 1859. See Koht, Halvdan, \\"Norske Flagsange, Kristiania 1896, p. X. (Norwegian: sildesalaten, Swedish: sillsalladen)\\"Sedan ..

It came to be popularly known under this name in both countries and to this day is its common denomination in these languages.  Abolition  During the 1870s, the union became increasingly unpopular in Norway, and as a consequence the union mark was seen as a sign not of equality, but of a union forced upon the country against its will. Radicals made it their political goal to reintroduce the \\"pure\\" Norwegian flag as the first step toward the dissolution of the union.Hofstad, Marius B. (2006). \\"Et splittelsens tegn. Flaggstriden i Norge p√• 1890-tallet\\". Universitetet i Oslo, pp. 21‚Äì24. The parliamentary majority voted for the removal of the mark three times, but was defeated by royal veto twice. Finally, in 1898, the third royal veto was overruled and the union mark was removed from the national (merchant)Kongelig Kundgj√∏relse (Royal announcement) 10 December 1898. and the state flag. It remained in the war flag (naval ensign), as this was under the jurisdiction of the king. However, parliament introduced a new state flag for government buildings, similar to the war flag, but without the union mark. The \\"pure\\" Norwegian flag was hoisted again in 1899. After Norway's unilateral withdrawal from the union on 7 June 1905, the union mark disappeared from the naval ensign as well on 9 June. It remained in all Swedish flags until Sweden formally recognized the dissolution of the union. By a royal decree of 27 October, the union mark in the merchant flag and the naval ensign was to be replaced with a blue field on 1 November 1905.

Whitsbury was said in 1274‚Äì5 to have belonged to the Kings of England until the time of Henry I, who then granted it to Reading Abbey. Another slightly later source states that Henry I had given the manor to Godfrey de Vilur, and it was he who transferred it to the abbey. The manor certainly belonged to the abbey in the time of Henry I, who confirmed to it the church and land in Whitsbury which had belonged to Ingram the monk, and later kings added similar confirmations. In 1222 the Abbot of Reading obtained a grant of twenty oaks in the New Forest for mending his houses at Whitsbury. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the site of the manor was leased in 1540 for twenty-one years to Anthony Cotes, the tenant of the abbot, and five years later the manor itself was granted to Richard Morrison.

They were the first British hip hop group to be signed to a major U.S. record label, Profile Records. History The group's first releases were the twelve inch single \\"Victory\\" (Profile, 1990) and \\"Fry You Like Fish\\" (Profile, 1990), and the I'm Ready EP (Profile, 1990). This established their jazz-based style of hip hop, influenced by U.S. artists such as Gang Starr. The song \\"I'm Ready\\", however, was based on Jimi Hendrix's, \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" and showed early on a liking for the harder style that they adopted for later releases. \\"I'm Ready\\" was a popular song, and still regularly turns up on hip hop compilation albums today. Their debut album, Positive Reaction was released by Profile in 1990. The following year, the group released The Victory EP (Profile, 1991) and then took a break from recording. They returned with The Whole Nine Yards...And Then Some in 1992. Shortly after the release of the album, the group decided to go their separate ways. MCM had a short-lived solo career, releasing some twelve inches and guesting on other artists' tracks - such as Dodge City Productions' \\"Understand This\\" from their Steppin' Up and Out (4th & Broadway, 1993) album. The Principal went on to produce other artist's tracks, such as a remix of Run-D.M.C.'s \\"Ooh, What'cha Gonna Do?\\" from their Down with the King (Profile, 1993) album. Diamond J went on to provide scratches for Maxim's Hell's Kitchen (XL Recordings, 2000) album. Almost 20 years after the last Caveman album, front man MCM incorporated the name Caveman on his first solo studio album The Gospel: The Missing Gems of MCM Caveman (I-innovate UK, 2011).

In 1825, he was named a deputy surveyor of roads and, in 1828, surveyor of highways in the Home District. In 1831, he became associated with William Lyon Mackenzie as a Reformer. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada representing 1st York in 1834 and 1836. He reluctantly joined the rebellion of 1837 and protected the loyalist prisoners at Montgomery's Tavern from abuse. However, despite this, the governor Sir Francis Bond Head ordered his farm burned. Gibson fled to Lockport, New York, where he was employed as an engineer for the Erie Canal. In 1848, having been pardoned in 1843, he returned to his farm and was hired as a provincial land surveyor. In 1853, he was given the post of inspector of crown lands agencies and superintendent of colonization roads in Canada West.

It comprises most of the ascomycete yeasts. The members of Saccharomycotina reproduce by budding and they do not produce ascocarps (fruiting bodies). The subdivision includes a single class: Saccharomycetes, which again contains a single order: Saccharomycetales. Notable members of Saccharomycotina are the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the genus 'Candida' that includes several human pathogens. Etymology The name comes from the Greek word œÉŒ¨Œ∫œáŒ±œÅŒøŒΩ (s√°kkharon), meaning \\"sugar\\" and ŒºœçŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (mukƒìs) meaning \\"fungus\\". History and economic importance Historical records from ancient Egypt and China describe the processes of brewing and baking from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago, and the production of fermented beverages and foods seems to have paralleled the beginning of agriculture. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur demonstrated that yeasts are responsible for the fermentation of grape juice to wine. Saccharomycotina include some of the economically most important fungi known. Members include species of industrial and agricultural importance (e.g. brewing, baking, fermentation of food products, production of citric acid, production of recombinant proteins, biofuel production, biological pest control of crops). Other species cause economic losses worldwide (plant pathogens, contaminants of foods and beverages). Yet others are animal and human pathogens. Morphology Saccharomycete yeasts usually grow as single cells. Their cellular morphology is fairly simple, although their growth form is highly adapted. Asci are naked and ascospores can have several forms. No species produce ascocarps (fruiting bodies). Saccharomycete genomes are often smaller than those of filamentous fungi. Some species (e.g. Metschnikowia species) tend to form chains of budding cells that are termed pseudohyphae. Yet other species are able to produce true septate hyphae. Such species (e.g. Candida albicans) are termed dimorphic, which means they can propagate both as budding yeasts and as filamentous hyphae. Reproduction =Asexual reproduction= Asexual reproduction occurs mainly vegetatively by mitosis and budding. Saccharomycotina is characterized by holoblastic budding, which means all layers of the parent cell wall are involved in the budding event. This leaves a scar through which no further budding occurs. Asexual cells may vary in shape. The shape of the cell may be informative in terms of detecting mode of reproduction or taxonomic placement to genera or species. Although not commonly known, some species form endospores (e.g.Candida species). These are asexual spores that are formed within their mother cell (hyphal or single cell). Strains of Candida and Metschnikowia may also form asexual resting spores called chlamydospores. =Sexual reproduction= Sexual reproduction is not known for all species of Saccharomycotina, but may happen in certain species if environmental conditions favour it (e.g. deficiency in nitrogen and carbohydrate). Sexual reproduction is well known in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, the life cycle involves alternation between a haploid and a diploid phase. The life cycle proceeds as follows: Two cells of different mating type fuse and the nuclei undergo karyogamy. This results in a daughter cell with a diploid nucleus, functioning as an ascus, where meiosis occurs to produce haploid ascospores. When ascospores germinate, the haploid phase is established, and is maintained by further mitosis and budding. In most natural populations this phase is fairly short since ascospores fuse almost immediately after meiosis has occurred. This results in most yeast populations being diploid for most part of their life cycle. In Saccharomycotina there are two mating types present. The mating types specify peptide hormones called pheromones and corresponding receptors for each type. These pheromones organize the mating. The pheromones do not affect the same mating type or diploids, but bind to receptors of different mating type. Interaction between pheromone and receptor results in altered metabolism to allow for fusion between cells of different mating type. Distribution and ecology Saccharomycete yeasts are found in nearly all regions of the world, including hot deserts, polar areas, in freshwater, in salt water, and in the atmosphere. Their growth is mainly saprotrophic, but some members are important pathogens of plants and animals, including humans. They are often found in specialized habitats, e.g. small volumes of organic carbon rich liquid (e.g. flower nectar). Examples of ecological modes in Saccharomycotina: **Associations with insects **Associations with plants, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae with grapes **Plant parasitism (e.g. cotton boll rot by Eremothecium ashbyi, Eremothecium gossypii as pathogen on coffee, soybean and other crops) **Saprotrophism on leaves and decaying wood (e.g. Ogataea) **Human pathogens (e.g. species of Candida and Meyerozyma) Although yeasts are commonly isolated from soil, few are believed to have soil as a primary habitat. Accurate identification of species is important for understanding yeast ecology, something that is now possible with the increased use of DNA-based methods. Before molecular methods were available, identification was mainly based on morphology, something that resulted in misclassifications and further prevented reliable results of ecological research. Taxonomy Saccharomycotina is a subdivision (subphylum) of the division (phylum) Ascomycota. It is a sister group to Pezizomycotina. Yeasts were traditionally classified as a separate group of the fungal kingdom, but in recent years DNA- based methods have changed the understanding of phylogenetic relationships among fungi. Yeasts are considered to be a polyphyletic group, consisting of members of Basidiomycota, Taphrinomycotina, as well as Saccharomycotina. This realization has led to major changes in the phylogeny and taxonomy of Saccharomycotina. In addition, the recent changes in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants have had a major impact on the classification of fungi, including Saccharomycotina. The changes imply that a fungus can only bear one correct name, i.e. separate names for anamorphs and teleomorphs are no longer allowed. This involves major changes in Saccharomycotina taxonomy, as many species are currently described from both anamorphic and teleomorphic stages. The genus Candida is an example of a genus that is undergoing large-scale revisions. Molecular identification methods are important tools for discovery of new species and subsequently give better understanding of biodiversity in this group. Much of the future classification of Saccharomycotina will rest on phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences rather than on the morphological and developmental characters.

The parish includes a notable Elizabethan country house, Breamore House, built with an E-shaped ground plan. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary has an Anglo-Saxon rood. Overview The village of Breamore is mainly situated along the A338 road between Fordingbridge and Downton, although the Saxon church and Breamore House are about three-quarters of a mile west of the road. Within the Parish is the Marsh (an important surviving manorial green) and the River Avon: both are listed as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Other parts of the Parish fall within the Cranbourne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs, and are an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. History Breamore Down has several Bronze Age bowl barrows. There is also a long barrow known as the Giant's Grave, originally 65m long and 26m wide with flanked ditches, it is now partly damaged. Breamore Down also has a mysterious mizmaze on its heights. Argument rages as to whether the Bronze Age people or mediaeval monks were responsible for these patterns cut in the turf. The name Breamore, recorded as Brumore in 1086, may be derived from Old English \\"Brommor\\" meaning \\"broom(covered) marsh\\". At an early date the manor of Breamore belonged to the Crown, and in 1086 was part of the royal manor of Rockbourne. At an early date, probably by grant of Henry I, Breamore passed to the Earls of Devon, lords of the Isle of Wight, who held it from the king in chief. In 1299, Edward I assigned it to his consort, Margaret of France, but in 1302 Breamore was delivered to Hugh de Courtenay. From that time it descended with the Earls of Devon until it was granted, in 1467, to Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy. In 1475, Breamore escheated to the king, who granted it for life in 1490 to Sir Hugh Conway and Elizabeth his wife. In 1512, it was granted to Catherine of York widow of William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon and her heirs. Her son Henry was created Marquess of Exeter in 1525, but was beheaded in 1538‚Äì9, when the manor again passed to the Crown. The manor was granted in 1541 to the queen consort, Catherine Howard, and in 1544 to Catherine Parr, who, after the death of Henry VIII, married Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, to whom Breamore was granted by Edward VI in 1547. On his execution in 1549 it again passed to the Crown and was granted in 1579 by Elizabeth I to Christopher Hatton. William Dodington purchased from him and died in 1600 leaving a son and heir Sir William. From this date Breamore followed the descent of South Charford until 1741, when Francis Lord Brooke sold it to Samuel Dixon, preliminary to its sale to Sir Edward Hulse. Breamore railway station opened in 1866. It was served by the Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway, a line running north‚Äìsouth along the River Avon, connecting Salisbury to the North and Poole to the South. It closed in 1964, the disused station still exists on the road that leads east from the A338. St Mary's church The church of Saint Mary is an almost complete example of an Anglo-Saxon church. \\"St Mary‚Äôs Church, One of England‚Äôs most important Anglo-Saxon Churches,\\" by Simon Jenkins The building consists of a chancel and aisleless nave separated by square central tower. The east window with net like tracery dates from 1340. There is a \\"leper window\\" in the north wall. Seven \\"double-splayed\\" Saxon windows remain. The chancel arch and arch in west wall of the tower are 15th century. The tower houses four bells cast in late 16th and early 17th centuries. There is an Anglo Saxon inscription dating from reign of Ethelred II, and a badly mutilated Saxon rood with figures of Our Lady and Saint John. Breamore Priory The priory of Breamore was founded towards the end of the reign of Henry I by Baldwin de Redvers and Hugh his uncle, to whose descendants the advowson belonged. It was apparently visited by Richard II in 1384. Baldwin and Hugh de Redvers endowed their priory of Breamore with certain land in Breamore which formed the nucleus of the manor later known as Breamore Bulborn. Various donors added gifts of adjoining land which were merged in the manor. On the dissolution of the priory in July 1536 the site was granted in November of that year with the manors of Breamore and Bulborn to Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter and his wife Gertrude. It then followed the descent of Breamore Bulborn, becoming merged in that manor. Breamore House Breamore House stands north-west of the church. The original house was a very fine late 16th-century building of brick and stone, but was unfortunately burnt in 1856. It was restored on the old lines, incorporating such of the old masonry as was left, and now from a short distance still resembles an Elizabethan building. Breamore stocks The village stocks can be viewed by the A338 roadside. They were originally at the road junction, but are now opposite the Bat and Ball Hotel. They were restored after being badly damaged by a lorry. The stocks have a whipping post and horizontals with four leg holes. A modern roof has been erected over them.

Around that time Karmasoft held a level design contest. The game sold poorly with 284 copies, so Jennifer got it republished by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms) with up to 256 colors on screen. Due to mature content containing blood and Seppuku, the game was rated for players aged 25.http://legacy.3drealms.com/tech/manuals/Boppin.pdf Plot The game takes place in a multiverse where fictional universes exist mostly by the minds and dreams of people. One such universe called Arcapaedia is inhabited by video game characters, especially the two stick-figured, triangle-headed Yeet and Boik. However all the arcade games have been diminished due to the lack of bad guys and villains taken away by the puristic Hunnybunz Family. Since heroes and good guys are not able to rescue the missing characters, Yeet and Boik having a neutral alignment, set off to thwart Hunnybunz, his wife and his lovechild's intentions. Gameplay Levels are made up of blocks, elevators, refractors, prizes and two starting points. The game involves throwing blocks picked up from the starting point (one for each player in two-player games, only one is used in one-player) at blocks of the same type which are already in the levels. The blocks are thrown at 45 degree angles, and can be bounced off refractors placed in strategic parts of the levels. The blocks already in the level can be pushed around and bonus items can be collected for additional points, extra lives and extra credits. Each credit starts the player with five lives. The player can have a maximum amount of ten lives. If the player runs out of lives and credits, the game is over. If a thrown block hits a wall/floor, flies off the level or hits a block of another type, then the block is destroyed and the player loses a life. If a thrown block goes through a randomly chosen space on the level called the mystery spot, the screen will turn a gold shade and the player's score points earned are multiplied by 10% for the duration. If a thrown block, when it collides with the blocks of the same type, makes a special shape - a 2x2 square, a 3x3 cross shape, a 3x3 hollow square and a 3x3 square - then a monster is freed from the blocks. At the end of a level, bonus points are awarded for freed monsters. The two- player mode is more or less the same as the single-player mode but is basically a competition for the highest score. In every multiple 40th level, the gameplay changes slightly as a boss level, where the player has to launch weapon-like throwing blocks at the Hunnybunz opponent. The damage done by each throwing block is determined by the high score the player achieved. After sufficient damage has been done to the opponent, the episode is won. Getting touched by the opponent costs the player one life. Boppin' is notable for its odd tone; in the original 2.0 version of the game, the Accursed Toys logo was the company's original \\"Deady Bear\\" logo, a teddy bear stabbed with a kitchen knife and bleeding, and upon losing a life, Yeet and Boik would commit suicide by shooting themselves in the mouth and seppuku respectively. These assets were replaced in the 1.1 version, and were only accessible by using the command line \\"boppin.exe blood\\". The game's credits screen would also contain lengthy manifestos from both authors about their motivations behind this. Release The Amiga version of the game came had 150 levels, a level editor, a larger menu during gameplay, its own copy protection and three levels of difficulty. When the DOS version was released in November 15, 1994 it had updated audio, levels and graphics and came in four releases. The first release was the shareware version which had only 26 levels that made up the first episode. The second release was titled Basic Boppin' which had two episodes with 80 levels in all (the first 26 are different from the Shareware version). The third release released in December 9, 1994 was titled Super Boppin', came on a CD, had all four episodes with 160 levels plus a level editor and all violent features censored. The final release released in August 19, 2005 was freeware simply titled Boppin', had all the features of the third release and was the very release ported to Windows. Reception A review on Amazing Computer highlighted that the game had a number of video game references including Super Mario. References External links Interview with Jennifer D.

Overview The work on understanding Charles Babbage's calculating engines is Allan Bromley's greatest legacy. The October‚ÄìDecember 2000 issue of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing was dedicated to him for the quality of his research on this subject. His studies of the Antikythera mechanism, in collaboration with Michael T. Wright, led to the first working model of this ancient analogue computer.The University of Sydney News, 29 March 1988, p.39 Allan Bromley was an associate professor at the University of Sydney. His main academic interest was the history of computers. He died of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Biography Allan George Bromley was born on 1 February 1947 and named after his uncle Allan, who was killed in New Guinea during World War II, and his father George, who died on 8 August 1962. Allan grew up on a property at Freeman's Reach, on the Hawkesbury River, in New South Wales, Australia, in an historic home, \\"Sunny Corner\\". He completed his secondary education at Richmond High School and in 1964, at the age of 17, his academic ability earned him a scholarship to study science at the University of Sydney. He had been awarded the Nuclear Research Foundation Medal, University of Sydney, Summer Science School, 1963. Bromley graduated in 1967, with first-class honours in physics, and stayed on for a research degree in astrophysics He was awarded his PhD in 1971. His doctoral work on maser emission from interstellar gas clouds required extensive computation with high-order polynomials, and awakened his interest in computing. Bromley had an amateur interest in the history of mechanical inventions, and was aware of the ancestral figure of Charles Babbage. No one had ever made a very detailed study of Babbage's papers and, in a surprising career move, Bromley decided to turn historian, and took a year's sabbatical leave in 1979 to work on the Babbage Papers at the Science Museum in London. What he found was overwhelming: notebooks containing over 6,000 pages of Babbage's impenetrable scribblings, 300 machine drawings, and several hundred notations. They were to occupy Bromley for the next several years. His first marriage, to Jann Makepeace, was during this time. Bromley convinced the Science Museum in London that Babbage's Difference Engine No. 2, which had been designed between 1847 and 1849, could be built and, from 1989 to 1991, it was. After Babbage's engines, Bromley moved on to other historical computing artefacts. He made a ground-breaking study of the Antikythera Mechanism, originally made famous by the Yale historian Derek de Solla Price in the late 1950s. Price had speculated that the mechanism, dating from 50 BC, was an astronomical calculating device. Bromley's background in astrophysics paid dividends, and after several trips to Athens where he obtained radiographs of the inner mechanisms, and with the help of a clockmaker Frank Percival, back in Sydney, they produced a working reconstruction. In November 2000, Bromley was given a Distinguished Service Award and made an Honorary Associate of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. In 1998, after a long spell of illness, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. He met Anne Mitchell at that time and, on 15 April 2000, they married under the jacaranda tree in the Main Quadrangle at the University of Sydney.Received from Anne Bromley, Allan Bromley's widow, 22 September 2012.The last of the first, Biography of Allan Bromley, p.160 (2000) He died on 16 August 2002. Collections Bromley started collecting mechanical calculators in 1979. A year later he already had sixty pieces.The Gazette, May 1980, p.24 Eventually he was responsible for a collection of old computers which used to be displayed in the rear foyer of the building containing the University of Sydney Computer Science Department. At home, he had a large personal collection of mechanical calculators, slide rules, and the like. He was a generous donor of artefacts to museums in Australia, especially the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, and the Australian Computer Museum Society Inc. His collection included some rare pieces. The pride of place was taken by four mechanical anti-aircraft gun predictors developed and built by the British government after World War I. The machines, weighing about half a tonne, marked the height of mechanical computation; they were first used in the Spanish Civil War and extensively during World War II. They performed in real- time and were capable of predicting the firing angle to explode a shell within 10 meters of a plane at anything up to 10,000 meters.Omega Science Digest, Nov‚ÄìDec 1983 Charles Babbage's computing engines Replica of the Difference Engine in the Science Museum, reconstructed after studies of Charles Babbage's original drawings by Allan Bromley. Part of Allan Bromley's scholarship was his study, at the Science Museum library in London, of the original drawings for the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine designed by Charles Babbage more than a century earlier. These studies and the most detailed analysis and interpretation led to the reconstruction of two Difference Engines No. 2 under the direction of Doron Swade: Antikythera mechanism Antikythera mechanism built by Allan Bromley and Frank Percival. Bromley built a partial reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism, one of the oldest (surviving) geared mechanisms known. Working with Frank Percival, a Sydney clockmaker, he improved on an earlier reconstruction by Derek J. de Solla Price.Comments on \\"Decoding the Heavens\\", many details about Bromley's involvement in the Antikythera Mechanism research. Having tested Price's theory using Meccano parts, Bromley found that the mechanism was unworkable. Working with Percival, he improved the device by altering the function of the handle so that one complete rotation would correspond to a single day, which he considered to be the most obvious astronomical unit. Bromley worked with the same set of parts as Price, but suspected that a gap in the mechanism was originally home to several extra gears. Another breakthrough by Bromley concerned a train of gearing which appeared to have 15 and 63 teeth, for which Price had been unable to discover a purpose. Price considered these numbers to be too difficult to work with, and assumed that they should be corrected to 16 and 64, theorising that it could have operated a four-year cycle on the device. Bromley worked with the original count of 15 and 63 teeth, discovering that the train's cycle was four and a half years; four of such cycles equalled 18 years, a duration equal to the cycle of eclipses. With this gearing, the mechanism worked correctly, with the pointer moving into a new square for each new moon, as the handle is turned, meaning that each square on a dial represented one month. Over 223 months, or 18 years, the complete cycle is shown.

The bridge's design is a unique combination of a symmetric cable-stayed structure and a through-arch bridge; the through-arch bridge portion is reminiscent of a slender version of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Seri Saujana bridge, also called Bridge No 8, crosses Putrajaya Lake, an artificial lake made to provide natural cooling, and connects the Core Island (Precinct 4) to the Precinct 7 on Lebuh Sentosa highway. It is strategically located at the main entrance into the Core Island from the south, via the upgraded road (now Putrajaya-Cyberjaya Expressway ) and Kuala Lumpur‚ÄìPutrajaya Expressway, and links the Core Island, where the main government buildings are, with the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  Structure  Seri Saujana: 10 pairs of back stay cables in two planes, and 22 main stay cables in one plane Seri Saujana: main stay cables pick up the middle and hangers from arches pick up the edges of the main-span deck The Seri Saujana bridge is a new concept of a symmetric cable-stayed through-arch bridge. The bridge was designed by Michael Yamout of PJSI consultants, a Malaysian consulting engineering and architecture firm, as part of series of ten bridges built to access the Core Island within the new governmental city of Putrajaya. The symmetric cable-stayed system consists of two A shape pylons, each inclined away from the main span at an angle of 78¬∞, held by 10 pairs of back stays spread into two planes, and 22 main stay cables in one plane anchored on and pick up the middle spine of the main-span deck. The through-arch system, on the other hand, employs inclined hangers (from arches) anchored on and pick up the outer edges of the main-span deck. With support at the middle and the outer edges, the main-span bridge deck can be made relatively lightweight and slender. The bridge is controlled by the principal design parameters to reflect a transparent, elegant and futuristic slender looking structure, with an overall single span of 300m and total width of 32m. There are dual three lane carriageways. The deck level varies from RL 35.25m at abutment to RL 35m at centre of the bridge.

The first race run was in November 1977. It was originated and organized in just a few months by Sherm Miller, who worked for the Parks and Recreation Department of St. George City. It is currently the 13th largest marathon in the United States of America. Race The St. George Marathon accommodates up to 7,400 runners. All runners, male and female, from any nation, may submit registrations to run; but only 7,400 runners are selected by random lottery to participate. Runners must be able to complete the race within six hours. The race begins at 6:40 AM for wheelchair participants, and at 6:45 AM for runners. The course starts in the scenic Pine Valley Mountains at an altitude of 5,240 feet (1,598m), and descends nearly 2,600 feet (792m) through varied scenery, including the formations of spectacular white, pink, and red sandstone and black basalt in Snow Canyon State Park. The race finishes in Vernon Worthen Park in St. George City at an altitude of 2680 feet (816 m). Morning temperatures usually range from 38¬∞F to 44¬∞F (3¬∞C to 7¬∞C), while temperatures at the finish typically range from 65¬∞F to 85¬∞F (18¬∞C to 28¬∞C). History When Sherm Miller, who worked for the St. George City Parks and Recreation Department, returned to St. George after running the Deseret News Marathon in Salt Lake City, he was inspired to host a marathon in St. George. Although others were not as enthusiastic about the idea, he was allowed to hold his marathon. He quickly organized the first St. George Marathon, held in November 1977. That first race began on a cold day with 57 runners and one wheelchair racer. The participants faced a strong headwind as they ran. Near mile 20, one runner was almost hit by a hay truck. Of the 58 who started the race, only 38 reached the finish line, a finish line on a course that was later discovered to be 40 yards too short. The next year the number of participants grew to 378 just by word of mouth, drawn by the descriptions of the scenery of Southwestern Utah, including red and white sandstone formations in the Snow Canyon area just outside St. George, even though the race at that time was not yet a sanctioned marathon. Since then, the St. George Marathon has grown steadily and has since become a USA Track and Field Certified and Sanctioned race. In 2006, the 30th anniversary of the St. George Marathon, the race was limited to 6,700 participants, with applicants selected by random lottery, except for residents of Washington County, Utah and members of the St. George Marathon's 10-year and 20-year clubs who are officially entered into the race before the lottery. Also in 2006, the course was changed slightly in the last two miles for the run within the city, providing a route that is less congested with automobile traffic. The first member of the 10-year club was Debbie Zockoll who ran for the 10th time in 1987. She was also the first member of the 20-year club, in 2006 she became the first member of the 30-year club and she became the first member of the 40-year club in 2016, as she was one of those original 58 runners and is the only person to have participated in every St. George Marathon since then (so far). Race times are used by many participants to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Runner's World magazine has included the St. George Marathon in the Runner's World 10 Most Scenic Marathons, Fastest Marathons and the Top 20 Marathons in the USA; calling it one of four \\"marathons to build a vacation around.\\" Based on surveys of runners, Runner's World magazine named the St. George Marathon, the Most Organized Marathon. The race is known for tremendous volunteer support. The St. George Marathon is currently part of the Utah Grand Slam. The 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of transferring their entry to 2021 or obtaining a full refund.https://web.archive.org/web/20200813072903/https://www.stgeorgemarathon.com  References  External links * Official Web site of the St. George Marathon * St. George Marathon Elevation Profile * Information about The Mayor's Walk event Marathons in the United States Marathon Recurring sporting events established in 1977 Sports competitions in Utah ","title":"St. George Marathon"},{"id":"4341379","text":"Acer PC.

The rescue/recovery tool uses media containing a backup of the original factory condition or a favored condition of a computer as configured by an original equipment manufacturer or an end-user. OEM supplied media are often restore tools shipped with computers to allow the user to reformat the hard drive and reinstall the operating system and pre-installed software as it was when it was shipped.without user-created data files Many modern systems have eliminated use of a physical recovery disc and instead store this software in a separate partition on the hard disk itself. Overview As an alternative to using media supplied with a system, it is possible to make one's own rescue/recovery disk. The Macintosh computer tool's name is Disk First Aid; on Windows systems there is a Create Disk function. Factory reset \\"recovery\\" When a factory reset is done, user data is lost. The term \\"OEM recovery\\" refers to that type of \\"recovery.\\" What is \\"recovered\\" is the original system. Hewlett-Packard, using the term System Recovery, describes it as destructiveTHEIR emphasis recovery. They even advise removing \\"extra hard drives\\" to prevent loss of this too. Although non-destructive alternatives do exist, the standard OEM Systems Recovery of Microsoft Windows-based operating systems involves booting from a separate hard drive partition, CD-ROM, or DVD, reformating the hard drive and then copying operating system and software files. After the recovery process is completed, configuration such as the Windows Out-Of-Box Experience wizard is first run (along with any other additional setup the computer may perform), as it was on the initial startup of the computer. Most recovery systems use specialized software, though Toshiba and Dell licensed Norton Ghost technology for their recovery systems at one point. As of Windows Vista, Dell uses a Windows Imaging Format based image on a partition along with a tool launched from the Windows Recovery Environment's command prompt. Details =Recovery partitions= Most modern PCs store their recovery (non-destructive) or restore (destructive) tool on a hard drive partition rather than on bundled CD-ROMs or DVDs. They're typically accessed by using a specific key combination during system startup.after the computer's power-on self-test There's less cost to the OEM, but exposes the user to hard drive failure. An application used to create recovery discs or flash drive is sometimes offered to allow a backup of the recovery data. Recovery CDs can also sometimes be ordered directly from the OEM. For some computers, they can also recreate the recovery partition. Other recovery systems, such as those included with recent Apple Macintosh models, permit users to download the recovery partition over an internet connection, enabling successful recovery even if the hard disk fails or is replaced. Some third-party software has the function to create a factory recovery partition and one key system backup and restore for Windows PC and Server. Disk image recovery The advantages of OEM recovery media can be had, without some of their disadvantages, by using disk imaging software such as Mondo Rescue or Acronis True Image to create a bootable recovery CD containing an image of the machine in the desired initial state. For example, a user can install their operating system, install all device drivers for their hardware, install other desired software, and configure other personal settings. Some smaller OEMs even use bootable CDs generated by this software as the actual recovery CD or DVD itself. Criticism Many manufacturers, instead of supply a physical \\"recovery disc\\" store the \\"recovery\\" (destructive) software tool on a partition of the hard disk. Some software that was preloaded may not be included; likewise some device drivers.  Alternatives  Prior to the use of recovery discs, one would use a boot disk to boot the system, then reinstall software as necessary from the original installation media. A contemporary alternative, particularly used in Linux, is the installation disc or discs for a Linux distribution, or a Live CD or Live DVD ‚Äì a bootable disc. These can be used to boot the system and then either manually troubleshoot and repair problems (in the case of a live disc), or re-install or re-configure the operating system. In the case of free software, operating systems can legally be re-packaged and distributed, and thus there is no barrier to making the full installation available. However, in the absence of a backup of system- specific configuration, which is provided on recovery discs, a re-installed operating system may require re-configuration. Windows 8 includes two built-in recovery options, Refresh and Reset; Refresh re-installs Windows while preserving most user settings, while Reset performs a full restore back to its default configuration, similar to a factory restore function.

It is painted in oils on fruitwood and now hangs in the National Gallery, London. Subject matter The painting depicts a youthful Virgin Mary playing with the Christ child and handing him carnations. (The Italian title, La Madonna dei garofani actually means The Madonna of the Carnation.) These flowers, whose botanical name is dianthus (Greek for ‚Äòflower of God‚Äô), are a premonition of Christ's Passion ‚Äì according to Christian legend, the flower first appeared when the Virgin wept at the Crucifixion. The event takes place in a dimly-lit domestic setting influenced by Netherlandish art. The composition is based closely on the Benois Madonna by Leonardo da Vinci, although the colour scheme of blues and greens that link the Virgin with the landscape is Raphael's own. Through the arched window is a landscape with a ruined building, symbolising the collapse of the pagan world at the birth of Christ. Provenance The subject matter and size of the painting, little larger than a Book of Hours, suggest that it may have been intended as a portable aid to prayer. The identity of its original patron is unknown, although an inventory from the 1850s suggests that it was commissioned for Maddalena degli Oddi, a member of a prominent Perugian family, after she had taken holy orders. In the 19th century it was property of the painter Vincenzo Camuccini. =Attribution to Raphael= Only in 1991 was the painting identified as a genuine Raphael, by the Renaissance scholar Nicholas Penny. Although Raphael scholars were aware of the existence of the work, which had hung in Alnwick Castle since 1853, they considered it merely the best of several copies of a lost original. After a major public appeal the Madonna of the Pinks was bought in 2004 by the National Gallery from the Duke of Northumberland for ¬£34.88 million, with contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the National Art Collections Fund. To justify the expenditure it went on a nationwide tour to Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Barnard Castle. In the summer of 2006, Caruzzi et al. published online research which alleged that Nicholas Penny's attribution and the associated defence of it published by the National Gallery are based on incomplete analysis, untenable arguments and misinterpretations. In 2007 the posthumous publication of James Beck, From Duccio to Raphael: Connoisseurship in Crisis disputed the attribution of the National Gallery's painting Madonna of the Pinks to Raphael. Brian Sewell notably criticised the painting of being of low quality and possibly forged, pointing out how the Madonna's right leg seems disconnected from her body.

Plastron The species is distributed in China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hainan provinces as well as Hong Kong and Macau) and northern Vietnam. The populations from other parts of Vietnam and Laos are now regarded a separate species, the Vietnamese three-striped box turtle (C. cyclornata).Blanck et al. (2006) This species has three distinct black stripes on its brown carapace, with a yellow, slightly hooked upper jaw and a yellow stripe extending from the back of the mouth. The plastron is mostly black with a yellow border. In Hong Kong, this species feeds on fish, frogs and carrion; however, remains of crabs, snails and insects have been found in its faeces. It can grow up to 25cm (10 inches). It hybridizes vigorously with its relatives in captivity and in the wild, and hybrids may be fertile. Several of these have been described as new species, such as the Fujian pond turtle (\\"Mauremys\\" √ó iversoni), a hybrid between (usually) males of this species and females of the Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica). In addition, the golden coin turtle is suspected to be a parent of the supposed species Chinese false-eyed turtle and Philippen's striped turtle.Parham et al. (2001), Buskirk et al. (2005) The species is considered critically endangered with extinction by the IUCN.ATTWG (2000) It is used in folk medicine,da N√≥brega Alves et al. (2008) e.g. as the key ingredient for the Chinese medicinal dessert guƒ´l√≠nggƒÅo (ÈæúËãìËÜè); thus it is under threat because of unsustainable hunting. This is one of the most endangered turtle species in the world, according to a 2003 assessment by the IUCN. C. trifasciata is listed among Turtle Conservation Coalition's 25 Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles. Captive specimen on display at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington, DC Farming C. trifasciata is raised on some of China's turtle farms. Based on the data from a large sample (almost one-half of all registered turtle farms in the country), researchers estimated that the turtle farmers participating in the survey had the total herd of 115,900 turtles of this species; they sold 20,600 turtles of this species per year, with the estimated value of almost US$37 million. This would make a farm-raised C. trifasciata worth almost $1,800, making them by far the most expensive species tabulated in the survey (by comparison, a common Pelodiscus sinensis raised for food would be worth under $7, and a Cuora mouhotii, sold for the pet trade, around $80). Taking into account the registered farms that did not respond to the survey, as well as the unregistered producers, the total amounts must be significantly higher. Wild C. trifasciata are far more valuable than farmed- raised turtles of this species to both TCM practitioners and illegal wildlife traders. The gender of C. trifasciata is determined by gestation temperatures. Due to incubation temperatures at farms in warm lowlands, farms have only been able to produce females. This increased the price of wild-caught males to $20,000. The majority of farmed C. trifasciata are hybrids which can escape and establish populations, causing genetic pollution. The largest C. trifasciata farming operation is said to be located in Boluo County, Guangdong. According to the farm's founder Li Yi (ÊùéËâ∫), the farm was started in 1989 with eight wild turtles (two males and six females) bought at a local market, and now has \\"over 2000\\" turtles.Ë¥¢ÂØå‰∫∫Áâ©:ÈáëÈí±Èæü\\"‰∏≠ÂõΩÁ¨¨‰∏Ä‰∫∫\\" (\\"People and fortune: Country's No. 1 Golden-coin-turtle man\\") 2007-09-24 According to the farm's site, captive-born turtles start breeding at 8 years of age.Liyi Gold-coin Turtle Breeding Farm: Breeding and reproduction Footnotes References * Blanck, T., W.P.

Nineteenth-century Baptist writer J. J. Goadby named Eythorne as one of the three \\"most ancient Baptist churches in England\\".Goadby For many years the Church had associated village chapels in east Kent. Two of these remain--at Adisham and Nonington. Others were at Eastry, Ashley, Woolage Green, Wootton and Barnsole. Beginnings The immigrant Baptists and their English supporters held meetings at Eythorne and also at Canterbury, about away. Joan Boucher, or Bocher, who is sometimes described as Joan of Kent and known to have been involved in \\"reforming circles\\" in Canterbury DNB is said by \\"uninterrupted and uncontradicted tradition\\" Newton Brown to have been an early member of the church at Eythorne. She was burnt at the stake at Smithfield on 2 May 1550 after refusing to recant her views on the incarnation of Christ. The church's website tells us that she spoke of \\"our little meeting in quiet Eythorne\\" at the preceding trial. Soon afterwards, the Duke of Northumberland, one of the king's advisers, expressed concern about the \\"Anabaptists lately sprung up in Kent\\". 18th and 19th centuries The first recorded meeting house in Eythorne was on the Coldred Road and was probably built about 1755 with seats for 60 people; in 1773 it was doubled in size. In 1786 baptisms started to take place in the village itself, a change from the previous custom of baptising church members in the sea or river at Sandwich. Until 1750 the church seems to have forbidden singing, but half a century later a retired Dover banker, Peter Fector, who lived near the meeting house apparently objected to hearing the congregation's \\"hearty singing\\". In January 1804 church members gathered to discuss his offer of ¬£500 for the old meeting house along with an acre of land for a new chapel. This chapel, which is in use today, was built and opened the same year. In the late 1830s William Copley, husband of the writer Esther Copley (n√©e Beuzeville, previous married name Hewlett), became Baptist Minister in Eythorne. Though his ministry started well he developed problems, apparently alcoholism, which meant his wife had to support his work and help write his sermons.DNB Esther stayed on in Eythorne when William left in 1843.

Later, King Sagara, son of Bahu, was able to defeat the Haihayas or Taljungas together with the five hordes. King Sagara had divested the Paradas and other members of the Panca-ganah of their noble Kshatriyahood and demoted them to the barbaric caste of Mlechchas, due to their non-observance of sacred Brahmanical codes and neglect of the priestly class. Before their defeat at the hands of King Sagara, these five-hordes were called Kshatriya-pungava (\\"foremost among the Kshatriyas\\").Manusmriti X.43-44 The Vayu Purana state that the Udichya tribes, including the Panca-ganah, the Gandharas, Tusharas, Khasas, Lampakas, Madhyadesis, Vindhyas, Aprantas, Dakshinatyas, Dravidas, Pulindas and Simhalas, would be proceeded against and annihilated by Kalki in Kali Yuga.

It is the most important library in the city and in the province of Santa Fe. The library houses 186,000 books. It has three floors and includes a reading room for 190 people, a reading service for the blind, and photocopy and free Internet services. There is also a children's section, a multimedia library, and a bookbinding section. A newspaper and magazine annex (Hemeroteca) is located on a separate building around the block. History The library was founded in 1913 by judge and historian Juan √Ålvarez (1878-1954), who in 1909 addressed mayor Isidro Quiroga: \\"In this city of 200,000 inhabitants there is not a single public library that is capable of fulfilling with dignity the role assigned to such establishments.\\" On 1909-10-11 the project was authorized and the construction began at the Patio del Mercado, across Pasaje Centeno (now a small street called Pasaje Juan √Ålvarez). The library was officially inaugurated on 1912-07-24. At the time the Head of the La Plata University, Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez, stated in a lecture what was to be the motto of the library, \\"To know is to love, to ignore is to hate.\\"; this motto is printed on the entrance of the Reading Room. On that same year a group of people, El C√≠rculo de la Biblioteca was formed, with the purpose of organizing concerts, lectures, and art exhibitions and meetings. El C√≠rculo had no fixed seat until 1943, when they acquired the badly deteriorated facilities of the La √ìpera Theater (which was about to be demolished), then renamed El C√≠rculo Theater. The newspaper and magazine deposit was inaugurated in 1949. That year the library was also transferred to the municipality. The name of Juan √Ålvarez, the founder, was added to the library's in 1956, two years after his death. The continuous growth of the library required several reforms, until the building had to be completely restored and remodeled. It acquired its present structure in 1989.

The same name is given to the shuttlecock-object itself. Objectives The objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock-like object (the peteca) with your hand over a high net, similar to a volleyball net, causing the object to land inbounded on the opposite court. The peteca can only be hit once while on each side of the net. Doubles and singles, male and/or female matches are played, both for competitive or leisure purposes. History The word peteca is derived from a Tupian word meaning hit. Over time, the word found its way into Brazilian Portuguese language. Originally, peteca was played at times of celebration with dances and songs. Gradually, this play became more of a sporting activity. The game has been passed down through several generations by the Brazilian ancestors and has developed considerably along the way. Early petecas were very primitive home-made affairs consisting of stones wrapped in leaves tied inside an ear of corn. A more sophisticated version was described in a Brazilian-English dictionary as \\"a leather pad with feathers stuck into it.\\" Pictures of the first petecas are few and far between, but on 30 May 1979, Brazil issued a set of four postage stamps depicting children's toys, to commemorate the International Year of the Child. When Brazil was present at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium the Brazilian athletes took with them some shuttlecocks for amusement on the ship and during the intervals between games. The game of peteca fascinated athletes from many other countries who wanted learn the rules of the game. The problem was that there were no rules - it was just for pleasure. Peteca left the streets, the grass and the sand to become a field sport in Belo Horizonte in the 1940s. It was in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais state, that the toy shape was transformed to its current format, proper for competitive games. The typical peteca has four white chicken feathers attached to a base and connected to a bottom made with several thin layers of rubber. It was also in Belo Horizonte that the rules of the game were first written, as well as the first courts were built and the practice gained competitive sense with internal championships that were held in various social clubs of the city. In 1973 the Peteca Federation of Minas Gerais (FEMP) was founded, confirming the pioneering spirit of a sport born and developed among the Brazilian people. From Belo Horizonte, the practice has spread to other Brazilian states, and from there to other countries, like France, that adopted the game as it is played in Brazil. Peteca is now one of Brazil's fastest growing sports closely behind football and volleyball. Another version of the game, called Indiaca, and closely based on peteca has developed in Germany, first appearing in 1936. Rules of the game A peteca match is played to the best of the three games, singles or doubles. The first player (or the first pair) who scores twelve points wins the set. One game can last only a maximum of twenty minutes. If neither of the two sides have reached the required score, then the win is given to the team with the most points. The peteca must be struck with one hand only and must pass above the net to the oppositions side in order for them to return it. The server remains the same one until the service changes side. A point can only be won by the serving team. The player with the service has thirty seconds to score the point. If this is not achieved then the service is given to the opposing player/team. =Faults= There are a number of recognised faults which can occur. *Service fault: service passes to the opposing team if the peteca passes below the net, outside the limits of the court, if the peteca touches the net or if the peteca touches a player of the same team (double) before passing over to the opposing side. *The 'in play' faults: if a player puts his hands or feet on the opposing teams side (similar to what occurs in a volleyball game); if a player touches the peteca with two hands; if there are marked accompaniment and not striking; if any other part of his/her body touches it and if the peteca is not hit (head, feet). *The 30-second rule: the server or the team which is serving has 30 seconds to score the point. If the point is not scored in this period, then the service goes to the opposition. At the end of 20 seconds, the referee announces \\"10\\" as a warning of the time remaining. With the sounding of the referee's whistle, the rally is finished. This is a more strict rule, when there's a referee to open count. Equipment and court *Shuttlecocks: There are two types of shuttlecocks used in two different kinds of games of peteca. In a regular peteca tournament, the shuttlecock has a flat base and a standard weight of 42 grams. The feathers are crimped and straight. In a mini-peteca game, the shuttlecock has a rounded rubber base attached to five or more rubber discs. The base is softer on the hand. Although designs vary, the most common petecas (especially the competition type) consist of a base in the shape of a filled leather bag or a layered rubber pad, and a flight, which is usually made out of feathers stuck to the base. *Court: singles' games are played on courts 15 m x 5.5m. Doubles' games are played at 15 m x 7.5m. By comparison, a standard volleyball court is 18 m x 9m. Peteca is played on wood, cement or clay courts. Mini-peteca is played on a standard sized badminton court. *Net: men's games are played using a rectangular net topping 2.43 m high, similar to a volleyball net. Women's games lower it to 2.24 m. Children (8-12yrs) play over a 2 m high net. *Footwear: Sneakers with a firm grip to the floor are desirable. *Lightweight gloves: beginners often find that the rubber base of the peteca is hard on the hands, usually leaving red spots and a stinging sensation on them. It is suggested that they wear a lightweight fingerless glove, similar to those used in rugby. Competition Competitive court games have been played in Brazil since the early 1930s. It was only in 1973 that the first rules were written. In 1985, the National Sports Council of Brazil drew up the first official set of rules so that competitions could be held between cities and states, and only into 1987 that the first Brazilian championship of peteca was organized. In 1995, under the direction of the President of the Brazilian Confederation of Terrestrial Sports, new rules were introduced into the game play to make it still more competitive and attractive. Currently, in Brazil, there's a Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Peteca,peteca.com.br still incipient, being formed around the preexistent Federa√ß√£o Mineira de Peteca,fempemg.hpg.ig.com.br from the state of Minas Gerais. A version of peteca, indiaca, was developed by in Germany in 1936 and is very popular. However, France was one of the first European countries to embrace peteca proper. The Federation Fran√ßaise de Peteca (FFP)federationdepeteca.com is the national organ for France and was created in February 1997 by Jean-Fran√ßois Impinna, a French former international rugby player, and counts thousands of French peteca players. The United Kingdom has recently followed suit and taken up the game with the United Kingdom Peteca Association - UKPAukpeteca.co.uk leading its development. May 2006 would see the first International Peteca Tournament being hosted by the FFP in Sannois, Paris. Teams from Brazil, France and the United Kingdom were to compete.

Originally a network-programmed block, Nelvana took over programming responsibilities in October 3, 1998. History =Think CBS Kids= In 1997, taking advantage of the tightened Children's Television Act regulations instituted the previous year by the Federal Communications Commission that required broadcasters to carry three hours of educational programming each week, CBS launched an all-\\"educational/informational\\" Saturday morning lineup for the 1997-98 season, known as Think CBS Kids (which served as both the block's branding and tagline). The block consisted entirely of live-action series (marking the first time that CBS did not feature animated series within its children's program lineup) ‚Äì including the youth-oriented game show Wheel 2000 (a spin- off of the syndicated game show Wheel of Fortune), which aired simultaneously on the Game Show Network; Sports Illustrated for Kids (a series based on the youth-oriented magazine spun off from Sports Illustrated); The Weird Al Show; Fudge; The New Ghostwriter Mysteries (a reboot of the popular public television series); and Beakman's World. The one-minute youth-oriented series of segments, In the News, was also briefly revived as part of the new block, hosted by Dan Raviv, a Washington, D.C.-based correspondent for CBS Radio News. Think CBS Kids suffered from low ratings as a whole, resulting the network canceling most of the block's shows after four months. Fudge was subsequently replaced by reruns of CBS Storybreak (the show and Beakman's World were both carried over from the network's previous children's block CBS Kidz). =Relaunch as the CBS Kidshow= In January 1998, CBS entered into a programming agreement with the Canada-based animation studio Nelvana to program the Saturday morning time slot allocated to children's programming. Think CBS Kids was planned to relaunch as the CBS Kidshow on September 19 of that year, but CBS delayed the block's relaunch to October 3. The new block featured several first-run series co-produced by Nelvana, CBS and Scottish Television such as Anatole, Mythic Warriors, Rescue Heroes and Flying Rhino Junior High. The premiere of Mythic Warriors was further delayed due to its complicated animation techniques; reruns of Tales from the Cryptkeeper aired in Mythic Warriors' time slot until it premiered on November 7. In June 2000, a few months after Viacom (which CBS founded in 1952 as television syndication distributor CBS Films, Inc., and later spun off in 1971 after the then- recently implemented Financial Interest and Syndication Rules barred networks from holding financial interest in syndicated programming content) completed its $37 billion merger with CBS Corporation, CBS reached an agreement with new corporate cousin Nickelodeon to air programming from the cable channel's preschool-oriented block Nick Jr. beginning that September. Prior to the deal, former Nick Jr. series Rupert moved to the CBS Kidshow block in January 1999, as part of an agreement in which both it and another animated series, Franklin, swapped networks (with Franklin moving from CBS to the Nick Jr. block on Nickelodeon). The CBS Kidshow block ended its run on September 9, 2000, and was replaced the following week on September 16 by Nick Jr. on CBS. Nelvana then proceeded to create a new Saturday morning cartoon block, the Bookworm Bunch (so named because all of that block's series were adaptations of children's books), for CBS' non-commercial rival, PBS, which premiered two weeks later. Several of the series were also rerun in Scotland as part of co- producer STV's wknd@stv block in the early 2010s. Programming =Scheduling variances and pre-emptions= Although the block was intended to air on Saturday mornings, some CBS affiliates deferred some programs over the course of the Think CBS Kids/CBS Kidshow block's run to Sunday or early Saturday morning time slots or tape delayed the entire block in order to accommodate local weekend morning newscasts, CBS News Saturday Morning (which debuted alongside Think CBS Kids, and was later replaced in 1999 by the Saturday edition of The Early Show) or other programs of local interest (for example, then-affiliate KTVT in Fort Worth, Texas ‚Äì now owned-and-operated by CBS ‚Äì aired the Think CBS Kids block from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. on Saturdays and 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. on Sundays from 1997 to 1998). Other stations pre-empted some programs outright for these same reasons, as well as due to professional and college sports telecasts scheduled by CBS (especially in the case of college football and basketball games) or its stations (primarily through sports syndication services), although most affiliates aired the block in its entirety.

Autonomy for Veneto\\" North-East Project (, PNE) is a Venetist, fiscal federalist and libertarian Italian political party based in Veneto, demanding larger autonomy, if not complete independence for the region. History The party was founded in June 2004 by Giorgio Panto, along with former members of the Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord (LV‚ÄìLN) and former members of Liga Fronte Veneto, notably Mariangelo Foggiato and Ettore Beggiato. Panto himself had been a long-time supporter of Lega Nord, but he distanced from it as he perceived it to be too moderate and Lombardy-centred. The PNE won 5.4% of the vote in the 2005 regional election, electing Foggiato and Diego Cancian to the Regional Council of Veneto, while Panto, who was candidate for President and ran a campaign based on the slogan \\"Dignity. Autonomy for Veneto\\", took 6.0% (16.1% in the stronghold of Treviso). The key-issue for the party within the Regional Council has since been transforming Veneto into an autonomous region as Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. In the 2006 general election the party won 2.7% of the vote in Veneto and the 0.7% in Friuli- Venezia Giulia for the Chamber of Deputies, while the list for the Senate, headed by Panto, did not go further 3.5%, failing to elect him senator (he would have needed to surpass the 8.0% threshold for parties non affiliated to a national coalition). In the Treviso provincial election Panto and the PNE won respectively 10.3 and 10.8% of the vote, respectively. In November 2006 Panto died in a helicopter accident, laying the future of the party, which was heavily dependent on his leadership, personality and cash, on the line. In 2008 the PNE was on the verge of forming an alliance with LV‚ÄìLN and The People of Freedom (PdL). However, after that talks with the leaders of the centre- right failed, the PNE decided not to present a list for the 2008 general election, thus helping Lega Nord to win 27.1% of the vote in the region. In October 2008 the PNE signed a coalition pact with Liga Veneta Repubblica (LVR; which soon left the alliance) and Venetian Agreement (IV) for the future municipal, provincial and regional elections \\"in order to provide an adequate representation to the Venetian people, in line with what happens in Europe, from Scotland to Catalonia, from Wales to Brittany, where federalist, autonomist and independentist parties, who resopond uniquely to their territory, see their popular support increasing.\\"http://www.asca.it/moddettregione.php?id=324139&img;=&idregione;=&nome;=&articolo;=VENETO/ELEZIONI:%20NASCE%20ALLEANZA%20TRA%20PNE%20INTESA%20E%20LIGA%20VENETA In November 2008 Cancian left the party in disagreement with Foggiato and launched the Forum of the Venetians.Consiglio Regionale Veneto - Sala stampa In the 2009 provincial elections the PNE had its best result in Belluno (1.6%), where it supported the candidate of LV‚ÄìLN. For the 2010 regional election the party finally chose to support Antonio De Poli (UDC) for President under the banner of North-East Union (UNE), along with UNE, LVR and IV. The list won 1.5% of vote, with peaks of 1.9% and 1.8% in the provinces of Treviso and Belluno, and Mariangelo Foggiato (PNE) was re-elected to the Council. In the 2011 provincial election of Treviso the UNE won 2.4% of the vote and the PNE lost all its provincial councillors. In July 2014 the party joined \\"We Independent Veneto\\" (NVI), a coalition of Venetist and separatist parties including LVR, Veneto State (VS), Independent Venetians (VI) and other minor groups. In April 2015 NVI formed a joint list for the 2015 regional election named Independence We Veneto (INV), a sort of re-edition of 2010's UNE, but with a separatist platform and in support of Luca Zaia, incumbent President of Veneto and candidate of LV‚ÄìLN.http://www.ilgazzettino.it/NORDEST/TREVISO/elezioni_regione_veneto_zaia_comencini_foggiato/notizie/1312771.shtmlhttp://www.venetouno.it/notizia/44153/comencini- e-foggiato-ancora-insieme-a-luca-zaiahttp://www.miglioverde.eu/noi-veneto- indipendente-ufficializza-lalleanza-con-zaia/ In the election, the list won 2.7% of the vote (0.2% more than IV) and Antonio Guadagnini of VS was elected regional councillor.http://ricerca.gelocal.it/tribunatreviso/archivio/tribunatreviso/2015/06/28/treviso- indipendenza-i-veneti-diranno-la-loro-11.html Ideology North-East Project, which is active also in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, proposes the creation of a \\"macro-region\\" (macro-regione) through the merger of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol. This peculiarity among Venetist parties explains the party's name. The party is also more economically liberal and libertarian than its principal competitors, Liga Veneta and The People of Freedom, and tends to put fiscal federalism first. Among other issues, it tends to be very similar to the other Venetist parties.

Its capital is Massenya. It is composed of part of the former Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture (sub- prefectures of Massenya and Bousso) and parts of the sub-prefecture of N'Djamena). History The region was the historic heartland of the Sultanate of Bagirmi, which ruled much of the area from its capital in Massenya from the late 15th - late 19th centuries. Geography The region borders Hadjer-Lamis Region to the north, Gu√©ra Region to the east, Moyen-Chari Region to the southeast, Tandjil√© Region to the south, and Mayo-Kebbi Est Region, N'Djamena and Cameroon to the west. The Chari River flows through the west and south of the region. =Settlements= Massenya is the regional capital; other major settlements include B√§ Illi, Bogomoro, Bousso, Dourbali, Koundoul, La Loumia, Linia, Ma√Ø A√Øche, Mand√©lia and Mogo. Demographics As per the census of 2009 the population in the region was 621,785, with 50.30% females. The average size of household as of 2009 is 5.40; it was 5.40 in rural households, whilst it was 5.40 in urban areas. The number of households was 115,118: it was 102,322 in rural areas and 12,796 in urban areas. The number of nomads in the region was 31,205, 8% of the population.

As a part of decentralisation in February 2003, the country was administratively split into regions, departments, municipalities and rural communities. The prefectures, which were originally 14 in number, were re-designated into 17 regions. The regions are administered by Governors appointed by the President. The Prefects, who originally held the responsibility of the 14 prefects, still retained the titles and were responsible for the administration of smaller departments in each region. The members of local assemblies are elected every six years, while the executive organs are elected every three years. As of 2016, there are totally 23 regions in Chad, which are divided based on population and administrative convenience.

As the title suggests, the character Magnum is a private investigator. In the original series, Magnum was portrayed by Tom Selleck. Jay Hernandez portrays the character in the 2018 reboot series. Magnum, P.I. (1980‚Äì1988) =Biography= Early life The character Thomas Sullivan Magnum III was around forty years old during the original series, although a variety of birthdates have been indicated (see below). Both his father and grandfather were naval officers. He was born in Detroit, but raised in the Tidewater region of Virginia. In high school, his football team won a Virginia State football championship. Some members of his family, including his mother, still reside there (as seen and referenced in various episodes). In addition to English, Magnum speaks Vietnamese and French. Personality Magnum was endowed with a rich assortment of personality traits, quirks, and preferences. He was an avid sports fan, not only of baseball (he was a lifelong Detroit Tigers baseball fan), but of American football (having been a former quarterback for the U.S. Naval Academy, he evinced an intense fondness for the annual Army‚ÄìNavy Game that often worked its way into plotlines), and during varied episodes he tried out for a professional football team, coached and played both basketball and softball, and participated in the Ironman Triathlon. Magnum regularly worked out on a surf ski and participated in local competitions, and enjoyed daily swims in the tidal pool off Robin's Nest. Magnum was originally envisioned as a Bond type but at Selleck's request was made into more of an average \\"everyman\\" with numerous character flaws including immaturity, talking in a whiny voice when stressed, over confidence, being manipulative towards his friends, and often losing many smaller character conflicts in sometimes humiliating ways before solving the case. It became apparent during Season 1 that Magnum was a fan of the bands Styx, Jefferson Starship and Blondie but also admitted to owning cassettes of Bach and Beethoven, mainly to appease Higgins. His \\"Stuff\\" Magnum's drink of choice was \\"Old Dusseldorf\\" in a long-neck bottle, as well as Scotch on the rocks; also he enjoyed sneaking fine wines out of Robin Masters's wine cellar when he believed Higgins was not looking. Among his trademarks was his \\"stuff,\\" souvenir possessions collected over the years such as baseball bats and gloves, a disturbing looking gorilla mask, and a yellow rubber chicken. He also owned a Beta tape of Stalag 17, his favorite movie. His personal weapon, seemingly carried only when deemed necessary, was a Colt Government Model .45 ACP handgun (as stated in several episodes), Colt Commercial version of the standard military-issue M1911A1 pistol (in actuality, a similar-looking 9mm Star Model BM, as .45 ACP 1911s of the time could not reliably cycle blanks). A genuine Gauguin hung on the wall of the guest house he occupied (in actuality, a composite of two real Gauguin paintings), he had free use of Masters' Ferrari 308 GTS, and he often bartered with Higgins for use of expensive cameras, the tennis courts, and other accoutrements of wealthy living. Perhaps his most valued possession was his late father's Rolex GMT Master aviator's wristwatch. Magnum's father was a Naval Aviator killed in the Korean War when Magnum was only five (something that is an anachronism, as the GMT Master was introduced in 1954, too late for both active combat missions and Magnum to have been five when his father died). In early seasons Magnum also wore a Chronosport Sea Quartz 30. He, along with Rick and T.C., wears a team ring with a Croix de Lorraine on it from their time in Vietnam. Birthdate Magnum's birthdate has been given on multiple occasions, nearly all conflicting: *In the second season episode \\"Memories are Forever\\", his driver's license notes it as January 5, 1946. Magnum's PI license is also shown in the fifth season episode \\"Murder 101\\", using this date. *In the second season episode \\"Try to Remember\\", Magnum, waking up in the hospital with a serious head wound, gives his birthday as August 8, 1944. *In the fourth season episode \\"Letter to a Duchess\\", Magnum gives his age as 38, putting his birth date between November 1944 and November 1945, assuming the airdate of the episode corresponds to the in-show date. *In the fourth season episode \\"On Face Value\\", Magnum makes a point of being ten and not yet eleven in a flashback to August 4, 1956. This would put his birthday between August 5, 1945 and August 3, 1946. *The seventh season episode \\"Forty\\" centers around Magnum's 40th birthday, putting his birth in February 1947, assuming the airdate of the episode corresponds with the in-show date. =Careers= United States Navy =Annapolis= Magnum attended the United States Naval Academy, Class of '67\\"Lest We Forget,\\" Episode 1/10 or '68, depending on the episode referenced. While at the Naval Academy he dated Ginger Grant, no relation to the Gilligan's Island character, who became a professional tennis player and re-entered his life in the episode \\"Mixed Doubles\\". Additionally in the episode \\"From Moscow to Maui\\", Magnum states that he was the captain of the Annapolis football team during at least one Army‚ÄìNavy game; Army scored a touchdown early in the first quarter from a play he called. =Active duty= He served ten or more years as an officer in the United States Navy, rising to the rank of lieutenant before resigning from the service in disillusionment in 1979.\\"I Witness\\" In Magnum's opening narration he mentions the year he resigned and started as private investigator. Magnum was a Vietnam War veteran and a former POW who believed his wife Michelle died in bombing during the final pull-out from Saigon. He served in both the SEALs and Naval Intelligence during his Navy years, and as such maintained many contacts in both \\"communities\\". In the episode \\"Solo Flight\\" he is seen wearing the rank insignia for a lieutenant commander. By the final episode of Magnum P.I. in 1988, Thomas had decided to return to active duty in the Navy at the rank of commander (O-5). =Military decorations and awards= On his Navy uniform, Magnum wore service ribbons for the Navy Cross, Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Gallantry Cross, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. { Navy SEAL pin 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px } 212px Specifically in the season 2 episodes 23/24, \\"Memories are Forever\\" parts 1 & 2, we see the uniform Magnum is to wear to Washington, D.C., presented to him by Mac (so it should be correct). The collar has the commander rank, with the Special Warfare insignia with the Navy Cross, Purple Heart with 1 bronze oak leaf cluster, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with service star, Vietnam Gallantry Cross, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. Private investigator After leaving the Navy, Magnum became a largely penniless private investigator \\"beach bum\\" in Hawaii who, despite irregular employment, managed to secure a cushy job offer about six months after his discharge. He was able to live a comfortable existence thanks to celebrity author Robin Masters, by whom Magnum had been hired to test, on a semi-regular basis, both the security of his estate and the astuteness of his estate's majordomo, Jonathan Quayle Higgins. The job perks included use of the guest house on his Hawaii estate \\"Robin's Nest\\" and use of his red Ferrari 308 GTS in exchange for quality control of the estate security. In the course of the series, Magnum and his friends became involved not only in typical \\"P.I.\\" cases but also a wide variety of adventures involving espionage, covert operations, paramilitary escapades, and \\"lifestyles of the rich and famous.\\" The blending of private investigator and beach bum characteristics allowed the frequent addition of a strong comic element into the action-drama-comedy series. Magnum extremely disliked being referred to as a \\"P.I.\\", \\"Private Eye\\", or \\"Private Detective\\", and quickly corrected people by saying he was a \\"Private Investigator\\". He often appeared in either khaki pleated shorts or blue jeans (Navy-issue swim trunks, or Levis), an Aloha shirt, and Sperry boat shoes or white Puma Easy Rider Sneakers, usually without anything more than ankle socks. He often wore battered baseball caps of his favorite sports team, the Detroit Tigers, and sometimes one from his service in Da Nang (VMO-2). =Relationships= Friends Magnum regarded friendship as perhaps the most important element of life for him, and the theme of friendship ran throughout the many episodes. His most enduring friendships were with his former Vietnam comrades, Orville Wilbur Richard \\"Rick\\" Wright and Theodore \\"T.C.\\" Calvin, and their friendship not only survived but flourished under the eccentricities each showed the others, and the extreme, sometimes perilous stresses they shared. His other close friendship, of a love-hate nature, was with Jonathan Quayle Higgins III (referred to by T.C. as \\"Higgy-baby\\"), the ostensible majordomo of the estate where Magnum was a perennial guest (or in Higgins' view, moocher). Magnum persistently tried to foil Higgins' efforts to impose an orderly regimen on Magnum's disordered lifestyle, as they traded verbal jabs and one- ups-manship games with each other. Magnum lived in the guest house on Robin Masters' estate, Robin's Nest, as part of his being in-charge of security on the estate, which likely explains the almost unlimited access to the Ferrari. Other friendships were woven throughout his encounters in the series. He continuously took advantage of Lieutenant \\"Mac\\" MacReynolds, a Navy officer and intelligence source for many of his cases, but was devastated when Mac was killed in an assassination attempt on Magnum by \\"Ivan,\\" a Soviet intelligence operative who had also overseen the torture of Magnum when he was a POW in Vietnam. For almost every season in the series, Magnum's investigations paralleled and sometimes crossed those of Honolulu Police Lieutenant Tanaka, with the obvious respect they held for each other going well beyond a shared enjoyment of the Detroit Tigers. Magnum maintained friendships with women as well, most notably Assistant District Attorney Carol Baldwin and Lieutenant (later Lieutenant Commander) Maggie Poole, MacReynolds' successor. Magnum was no less apt to exploit his friendship with Carol or Maggie as he was his male friends, and no less loyal. Numerous episode plots featured \\"old friends\\" calling on Magnum for help, requests he always honored, even when helping conflicted with his best judgment. Family After Magnum's father's death, his mother Katherine married Frank Peterson. They had a son Joey, who ran away for reasons unknown before dying while serving in Vietnam. Magnum also has an aunt, Phoebe Sullivan, who is a novelist, Guest starring Barbara Rush as Phoebe Sullivan. and a cousin named Karen. While serving in South Vietnam, Magnum married a beautiful French-Eurasian nurse named Michelle Hue, the widow of North Vietnamese General Nguyen Hue. Magnum left Vietnam believing Michelle was killed during the 1975 evacuation of Saigon. Her death was staged because General Hue had resurfaced and Michelle knew Magnum wouldn't leave Vietnam without her. Michelle was a devout Catholic and in the eyes of the church Hue was her husband, not Magnum. In \\"Memories Are Forever\\" (November 1981), Magnum was reunited with his presumed dead wife and learned the truth behind her deception. Unbeknownst to Magnum at the time, they conceived a daughter during that reunion. The child, Lily Catherine, appeared in four episodes (\\"Little Girl Who\\", \\"Limbo\\", \\"Unfinished Business\\", and \\"Resolutions\\"). Although she was raised as the daughter of General Hue, Lily Catherine learned Magnum-related things from Michelle, such as \\"Detroit Tigers\\" and \\"Rick, T.C., Thomas\\". By \\"Resolutions\\" (May 1988), General Hue's enemies had killed Hue, Michelle, and Michelle's second husband, Edward Durant. Lily Catherine was presumed dead and was reunited with Magnum, who returned to his career as a Naval Intelligence officer to protect her. Magnum P.I. (2018‚Äìpresent) Jay Hernandez portrays a younger version of Thomas Magnum in the 2018 reboot of the series. In the reboot, Thomas Magnum is a decorated ex-Navy SEAL who returns home to become a private investigator. He gets help on cases from two of his friends from the Navy, Theodore \\"TC\\" Calvin and Orville \\"Rick\\" Wright, and from former MI6 agent Juliet Higgins. In season two, Higgins becomes Magnum's partner. Later in the season, Magnum asks Higgins to marry him in order for her to stay in the country after her visa expires. She initially accepts his offer, but later reverses her decision. Hernandez also played Magnum in a crossover episode with Hawaii Five-0.

The park is located near Ivins, Utah and St. George in Washington County. Other geological features of the state park include extinct cinder cones, lava tubes, lava flows, and sand dunes. About Snow Canyon is named after early Mormon settlers Lorenzo and Erastus Snow. It was designated as a Utah State Park in 1958. Two canyons, West Canyon and Snow Canyon, begin side by side at the north end of the park, cutting into the sandstone of the Red Mountains. The canyons converge, meeting in the middle of the park. Snow Canyon continues south-by-southeastward as a single, larger canyon. The canyon ends near the park's southern entrance, its mouth opening out onto the Santa Clara bench near Ivins, Utah. A paved two-lane road (formerly SR-300) enters the park from Ivins on the south, winds up the canyon, then climbs the eastern edge to the bench above Snow Canyon. There the road joins State Route 18. Ancient lava flows spill over the eastern edges of Snow Canyon from above, where the road climbs out of the canyon. The park boundaries extend northeastward across State Route 18, to encompass two cinder cones along the western edge of Diamond Valley. The highest point in the park, according to a U.S. Geological Survey topographical map, is a peak west of the southern cinder cone, above the eastern edge of the east fork of Snow Canyon. Facilities Snow Canyon State Park is open year-round. It contains 35 campsites for tents and RVs below . The day-use fee is $10. Hikers and bikers may obtain annual passes for $30. The Johnson Canyon trail (to a large arch) may be accessed without payment of fees, but is closed to hikers most of the year to protect nesting bird populations. The Johnson Canyon trail is usually open from approximately November to March. Climate Morning breaks over Snow Canyon State Park. Picture taken from an overlook just off of Utah State Route 18 Snow Canyon sits at the junction of the Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau. The climate is typical for a desert. Higher elevations tend to be dry and cooler. Lower elevations are also dry, but much warmer. Summers are hot with low temperatures of around and highs of over . Winters see lows around and highs around .  History  Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the region around Snow Canyon from AD 200 to 1250, utilizing the canyon for hunting and gathering. Southern Paiute used the canyon from AD 1200 to the mid-19th century. Mormon pioneers first came upon Snow Canyon in the 1850s while searching for lost cattle. Originally called Dixie State Park, it was later renamed for Lorenzo and Erastus Snow, prominent pioneering Utah leaders. In popular culture Many Hollywood films have been filmed in Snow Canyon. These include The Conqueror (1956) starring John Wayne, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Electric Horseman, Jeremiah Johnson, Run of the Arrow (1957), They Came to Cordura (1959), The Appaloosa (1966), Six Black Horses (1962), Bullet for a Badman (1964) and Gunpoint (1966).Maddrey, Joseph (2016).

Flora and fauna The vegetation of the area mainly consists of desert plants, such as creosote bush, scrub oak, yucca, cacti, and sagebrush. Various types of desert shrubs are found in the park against the rock formations Wildlife in Snow Canyon includes the Gila monster, peregrine falcon, and desert tortoise. Small fences to keep the ground-dwelling creatures from accidentally wandering onto roads can be seen across Snow Canyon and the St. George area. Other notable wildlife include the giant desert hairy scorpion, coyote, Mojave sidewinder, red-spotted toad, Utah banded gecko, and the side-blotched lizard, among many others.

It was founded in 1965 by Kjell Lindskog.  Formula Vee cars  Starting in 1966 the company produced two Formula Vee cars, Broke that was a copy of the American Beach Car and Dolling FVe that was a design by Willy Dolling. The Dolling was made in three versions between 1966 and 1967, in total 52 cars were built. In 1967 RPB started making their own Formula Vee car. It was simple to make and inexpensive. It sold well and did well in races. In 1968 the chassis was improved to make it more rigid and give it a more adjustable rear axle design. In 1969 the car was redesigned again, this time to increase performance, but only six were made due to rumours about changes in the Formula Vee rules. In 1970 the new rules came and they allowed a more wedge like shape and a longer and narrower car. 13-15 cars were made. The RPB cars were very successful and they won 14 out of 18 competitions. One of them was still winning races in 1978. The same model continued to be built in 1971 and 1972, but only in small numbers. In 1971 RPB cars made 22 European track records. In 1971 a Formula Super Vee car was made. This time using a monocoque chassis. The prototype car did well in races, but was plagued with engine problems and the rear end of the chassis had to be redesigned. After the redesign it worked better and the driver Bror Jaktlund managed to finished as number 3 in the European championship, even if a crash forced him to skip the last race. A second Super Formula Vee car was made in 1973 and was in use until it was sold in 1976. It then changed hands several times to owners in Sweden, Denmark and England until it came back to Sweden in late 2002.  Sports cars  In 1968 the RPB Piraya was introduced. It was a low, two seated kit car with gullwing-doors inspired by the Ford GT40 and made for a Volkswagen Beetle chassis. It sold 40 kits in less than a year, but some customers found it difficult to assemble the cars. In 1969 the RPB-GT was introduced. Prices started at 3800 SEK. The design was similar to the Piraya, but had normal front hinged doors. The kit was made easier to assemble for the customer. The GT sold well, most as kits, but some as completed cars. It used a fuel tank from Renault 10, hinges to the front and rear hood came from Renault 4, door handles and locks from Renault 16, door hinges and side windows (cut to size) from the Mini, the front screen from a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette, rear and front lights were Hella universal (although the same headlight units was also used in Saab 96, Saab 99 and Renault 16). In 1970 the new laws for homebuilt street cars was changed and required a mandatory crash test making kit cars virtually impossible to get street legal. Production for export, mostly to Finland and Norway, continued for a while. In May 1971 a fire destroyed the factory and the molds and it was not possible to restart production. The dealer in Finland had orders for more cars so he bought the rights to the RPB GT and made new molds from one of the delivered cars, but with desedigned rear and a 5 cm higher roof, and continued production for some years. RPB withdrew from car making and instead produced other plastic products such as bus interiors and snowmobile parts. In 1982 the law for amateur built cars changed so home built cars again could be made road legal. RPB decided to restart production with an updated model of the GT model. Some cars were built and showed on various exhibitions. They were well received both by media and public. But then RPB got a large order for plastic products for the Swedish military and the car production plans were put on hold. The Finnish mold was sold after some 20 cars were made and later changed hand several times. The last known owner was Allan Sj√∂backa in Vaasa and he tried to sell them.

In the Mahabharata, its inhabitants, known as the Tusharas, are depicted as mlechchas (\\"barbarians\\") and fierce warriors. Modern scholars generally see Tushara as synonymous with the historical Tukhara, also known as Tokhara or Tokharistan ‚Äì another name for Bactria. This area was the stronghold of the Kushan Empire, which dominated India between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE. Tukhara The historical Tukhara appears to be synonymous with the land known by Ancient Chinese scholars as Daxia, from the 3rd century BCE onwards. Its inhabitants were known later to Ancient Greek scholars as the Tokharoi and to the Ancient Romans as Tochari. Modern scholars appear to have conflated the Tukhara with the so-called Tocharians ‚Äì an Indo-European people who lived in the Tarim Basin, in present-day Xinjiang, China, until the 1st millennium. When the Tocharian languages of the Tarim were rediscovered in the early 20th century, most scholars accepted a hypothesis that they were linked to the Tukhara (who were known to have migrated to Central Asia from China, with the other founding Kushan peoples ). However, the subjects of the Tarim kingdoms appear to have referred to themselves by names such as Agni, Kuƒçi and Kror√§n. These peoples are also known to have spoken centum languages, whereas the Tukhara of Bactria spoke a satem language. The Tukhara were among Indo-European tribes that conquered Central Asia during the 2nd century BCE, according to both Chinese and Greek sources. Ancient Chinese sources refer to these tribes collectively as the Da Yuezhi (\\"Greater Yuezhi\\"). In subsequent centuries the Tukhara and other tribes founded the Kushan Empire, which dominated Central and South Asia. The account in Mahabharata (Mbh) 1:85 depicts the Tusharas as mlechchas (\\"barbarians\\") and descendants of Anu, one of the cursed sons of King Yayati. Yayati's eldest son Yadu, gave rise to the Yadavas and his youngest son Puru to the Pauravas that includes the Kurus and Panchalas. Only the fifth son of Puru's line was considered to be the successors of Yayati's throne, as he cursed the other four sons and denied them kingship. The Pauravas inherited the Yayati's original empire and stayed in the Gangetic plain who later created the Kuru and Panchala Kingdoms. They were followers of the Vedic culture. The Yadavas made central and western India their stronghold. The descendants of Anu, known as the Anavas, are said to have migrated to Iran. Various regional terms and proper names may have originated with, or been derived from, the Tusharas including: Takhar Province in Afghanistan; the Pakistani village of Thakra; the surname Thakkar, found across India; the Bengali surname Thakur, including the Tagore family; the Marathi surname Thakere, sometimes anglicised as Thackeray; the Takhar Jat clan in Rajasthan, and; the Thakar tribe of Maharashtra. It is also possible that the Thakor (or Thakore) caste of Gujarat, the Thakar caste of Maharashtra and; the title Thakur originated with names such as Tushara/Tukhara. The Sanskrit word thakkura \\"administrator\\" may be the source of some such names, or may itself be derived from one of them. Indian literature =References in Mahabharata= The Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata associates the Tusharas with the Yavanas, Kiratas, Chinas, Kambojas, Pahlavas, Kankas, Sabaras, Barbaras, Ramathas etc., and brands them all as barbaric tribes of Uttarapatha, leading lives of Dasyus.MBH 12.65.13-15 The Tusharas along with numerous other tribes from the north-west, including the Bahlikas, Kiratas, Pahlavas, Paradas, Daradas, Kambojas, Shakas, Kankas, Romakas, Yavanas, Trigartas, Kshudrakas, Malavas, Angas, and Vangas had joined Yudhishtra at his Rajasuya ceremony and brought him numerous gifts such as camels, horses, cows, elephants and goldMahabharata 2.51-2.53; 3.51 . Later the Tusharas, Sakas and Yavanas had joined the military division of the Kambojas and participated in the Mahabharata war on the side of the Kauravas.MBH 6.66.17-21; MBH 8.88.17 Karna Parva of Mahabharata describes the Tusharas as very ferocious and wrathful warriors. At one place in the Mahabharata, the Tusharas are mentioned along with the Shakas and the Kankas.Shakas.Tusharah.Kankascha At another place they are in a list with the Shakas, Kankas and Pahlavas.Shakas Tusharah Kankashch.Pahlavashcha And at other places are mentioned along with the Shakas, Yavanas and the KambojasShaka.Tushara.Yavanashcha sadinah sahaiva.Kambojavaraijidhansavah OR Kritavarma tu sahitah Kambojarvarai.Bahlikaih...Tushara.Yavanashchaiva.Shakashcha saha Chulikaih etc. The Tushara kingdom is mentioned in the traves of Pandavas in the northern regions beyond the Himalayas:- Crossing the difficult Himalayan regions, and the countries of China, Tukhara, Darada and all the climes of Kulinda, rich in heaps of jewels, those warlike men reached the capital of Suvahu (3:176). The Mahabharata makes clear that Vedic Hindus did not know the origins of the Mlechcha tribes, who were highly skilled in weapons, warfare and material sciences, but never followed the Vedic rites properly. That the Vedic people were dealing with foreign tribes is evident in a passage from Mahabharata (12:35). It asks which duties that should be performed by the Yavanas, the Kiratas, the Gandharvas, the Chinas, the Savaras, the Barbaras, the Sakas, the Tusharas, the Kankas, the Pathavas, the Andhras, the Madrakas, the Paundras, the Pulindas, the Ramathas, the Kambojas, and several new castes of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and the Shudras, that had sprung up in the dominions of the Arya kings. The kings of the Pahlavas and the Daradas and the various tribes of the Kiratas and Yavanas and Sakras and the Harahunas and Chinas and Tukharas and the Sindhavas and the Jagudas and the Ramathas and the Mundas and the inhabitants of the kingdom of women and the Tanganas and the Kekayas and the Malavas and the inhabitants of Kasmira, were present in the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhishthira the king of the Pandavas (3:51). The Sakas and Tukhatas and Tukharas and Kankas and Romakas and men with horns bringing with them as tribute numerous large elephants and ten thousand horses, and hundreds and hundreds of millions of gold (2:50). The Tusharas were very ferocious warriors. The Yavanas and the Sakas, along with the Chulikas, stood in the right wing of the Kaurava battle-array (6:75). The Tusharas, the Yavanas, the Khasas, the Darvabhisaras, the Daradas, the Sakas, the Kamathas, the Ramathas, the Tanganas the Andhrakas, the Pulindas, the Kiratas of fierce prowess, the Mlecchas, the Mountaineers, and the races hailing from the sea- side, all endued with great wrath and great might, delighting in battle and armed with maces, these all‚Äîunited with the Kurus and fought wrathfully for Duryodhana‚Äôs sake (8:73). A number of Saka and Tukhara and Yavana horsemen, accompanied by some of the foremost combatants among the Kambojas, quickly rushed against Arjuna (8:88). F. E Pargiter writes that the Tusharas, along with the Yavanas, Shakas, Khasas and Daradas had collectively joined the Kamboja army of Sudakshina Kamboj and had fought in Kurukshetra war under latter's supreme command.The Nations of India at the Battle Between the Pandavas and Kauravas, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1908, pp 313, 331, Dr F. E. Pargiter, (Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland). =In the Puranas and other Indian texts= Puranic texts like Vayu Purana, Brahmanda Purana and Vamana Purana, etc., associate the Tusharas with the Shakas, Barbaras, Kambojas, Daradas, Viprendras, Anglaukas, Yavanas, Pahlavas etc and refer to them all as the tribes of Udichya i.e. north or north-west.Brahmanda Purana 27.46-48. The Kambojas, Daradas, Barbaras, Harsavardhanas, Cinas and the Tusharas are described as the populous races of men outside.Markandeya Purana, LVII.39, The Markandeya Purana, F. E. Pargiter, Trans. Varanasi Reprint, 1969, pp 307-44; A Sourcebook of Indian Civilization, 2000, p 39, Niharranjan Ray, Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya. Puranic literature further states that the Tusharas and other tribes like the Gandharas, Shakas, Pahlavas, Kambojas, Paradas, Yavanas, Barbaras, Khasa, and Lampakas, etc., would be invaded and annihilated by Lord Kalki at the end of Kaliyuga. And they were annihilated by king Pramiti at the end of Kaliyuga.Vayu I.58.78-83; cf: Matsya 144.51-58 According to Vayu Purana and Matsya Purana, river Chakshu (Oxus or Amu Darya) flowed through the countries of Tusharas, Lampakas, Pahlavas, Paradas and the Shakas, etc.Vayu Purana I.58.78-83 The Brihat-Katha-Manjari10/1/285-86 of Pt Kshemendra relates that around 400 CE, Gupta king Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) (r. 375-413/15 CE), had \\"unburdened the sacred earth by destroying the barbarians\\" like the Tusharas, Shakas, Mlecchas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Parasikas, Hunas etc. The Rajatarangini of Kalhana records that king Laliditya Muktapida, the 8th- century ruler of Kashmir had invaded the tribes of the north and after defeating the Kambojas, he immediately faced the Tusharas. The Tusharas did not give a fight but fled to the mountain ranges leaving their horses in the battlefield.RT IV.165-166 This shows that during the 8th century CE, a section of the Tusharas was living as neighbours of the Kambojas near the Oxus valley. By the 6th century CE, the Brihat Samhita of Varahamihira also locates the Tusharas with Barukachcha (Bhroach) and Barbaricum (on the Indus Delta) near the sea in western India.bharukaccha.samudra.romaka.tushrah.. :Brhatsamhita XVI.6 The Romakas formed a colony of the Romans near the port of Barbaricum in Sindhu Delta.See comments: M. R. Singh in The Geographical Data of Early Purana, 1972, p. 26 This shows that a section of the Tusharas had also moved to western India and was living there around Vrahamihira's time. There is also a mention of Tushara-Giri (Tushara mountain) in the Mahabharata, Harshacharita of Bana Bhata and Kavyamimansa of Rajshekhar.√∑ Kingdom Historical references =Early Chinese & Greek sources= Little is known of the Tukhara before they conquered the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. They are known, in subsequent centuries, to have spoken Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language. The Yuezhi are generally believed to have had their ethnogenesis in Gansu, China. However, Ancient Chinese sources use the term Daxia (Tukhara) for a state in Central Asia, two centuries before the Yuezhi entered the area. Hence the Tukhara may have been recruited by the Yuezhi, from a people neighbouring or subject to the Greco-Bactrians. Likewise the Atharvaveda also associates the Tusharas with the Bahlikas (Bactrians), Yavanas/Yonas (Greeks) and Sakas (Indo-Scythians), as following: \\"Saka.Yavana.Tushara.Bahlikashcha\\".Ed Bolling & Negelein, 41.3.3. It also places the Bahlikas as neighbors of the Kambojas.AV-Par, 57.2.5; cf Persica-9, 1980, p. 106, Michael Witzel This may suggest suggests that the Tusharas were neighbours to these peoples, possibly in Transoxiana. =Later Chinese sources= In the 7th century CE, the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, by way of the \\"Iron Pass\\" entered Tukhara (Ë¶©Ë≤®ÁæÖ Pinyin Duhuoluo; W-G Tu-huo-luo).

The region was also known as Kumudadvipa of the Puranic texts, which the scholars identify with Sanskrit Kamboja.Dr Buddha Prakash maintains that, based on the evidence of Kalidasa's Raghuvamsha, Raghu defeated the Hunas on river Vamkshu (Raghu vamsha 4.68), and immediately after them he marched against the Kambojas (4.69-70). These Kambojas were of Iranian affinities who lived in Pamirs and Badakshan. Hiun Tsang calls this region Kiu.mi.to which is thought to be Komdei of Ptolemy and Kumadh or Kumedh of Muslim writers (See: Studies in Indian History and Civilization, Agra, p 351; India and the World, 1964, p 71, Dr Buddha Prakash; Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 300, Dr J. L. Kamboj). Before its occupation by the Tukhara, Badakshan formed a part of ancient Kamboja (Parama Kamboja) but, after its occupation by the Tukhara in the 2nd century BCE, Badakshan and some other territories of the Kamboja became part of Tukhara.Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, p 108, Dr J.

Kamboj; Around the 4th to 5th century CE, when the fortunes of the Tukhara finally waned, the original population of Kambojas re-asserted itself, and the region again started to be called by its ancient name, i.e. \\"Kamboja\\",Bhartya Itihaas ki Ruprekha, p. 534, J.

There are several later references to Kamboja of the Pamirs/Badakshan. Raghuvamsha - a 5th-century Sanskrit play by Kalidasa, attests their presence on river Vamkshu (Oxus) as neighbors to the Hunas (Raghu: 4.68-70). As seen above, the 7th-century Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang mentions the Kiumito/Kumito living to the north of the Oxus,Li, Rongxi (translator). 1995.

The 8th-century king of Kashmir, King Lalitadiya, invaded the Kambojas of the \\"far-spreading northern region\\" (uttarƒÅpatha) as mentioned in the Rajatarangini of Kalhana. After encountering the Kambojas, Lalitadiya's army approached the TuhkhƒÅras who \\"fled to the mountain ranges leaving behind their horses.\\"Kalha·πáa's RƒÅjatara·πÖgi·πáƒ´: A Chronicle of the Kings of Ka≈õmƒ´r.

Sircar, the Kambojas here are bracketed with the Tukharas and are shown as living in the eastern parts of the Oxus valley as neighbors of the Tukharas who were living in the western parts of that Valley.Sircar, D. C. \\"The Land of the Kambojas\\", Purana, Vol V, No ?, July 1962, p. 250.These Kambojas, apparently were descendants of that section of the Kambojas who, instead of leaving their ancestral land during second century BCE under assault from the Da Yuezhi, had compromised with the invaders and decided to stay put in their ancestral land instead of moving to the Helmand or Kabul valley.There are other references which also equate Kamboja with Tokhara. A Buddhist Sanskrit Vinaya text translated by N. Dutt, Gilgit Manuscripts, III, 3, 136, (quoted in B.S.O.A.S. XIII, p. 404) has the expression satam Kambojikanam kanyanam i.e. 'a hundred maidens from Kamboja'. This has been rendered as Tho-gar yul-gyi bu-mo brgya in the Tibetan and as Togar ulus-un yagun √ºkin in Mongolian. Thus, Kamboja has been rendered as Tho-gar or Togar. And Tho-gar/Togar are Tibetan or Mongolian forms of Tokhar/Tukhar (See: H. W. Bailey, Irano-Indica III, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1950, pp. 389-409; see also: Ancient Kamboja, Iran and Islam, 1971, p. 66, H.

The 10th century CE Kavyamimamsa of Rajshekhar lists the Tusharas with several other tribes of the Uttarapatha viz: the Shakas, Kekeyas, Vokkanas, Hunas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Pahlavas, Limpakas, Kulutas, Tanganas, Turusakas, Barbaras, Ramathas etc.Kavyamimamsa, Chapter 17. This mediaeval era evidence shows that the Tusharas were different from the Turushakas with whom they are often confused by some writers. =Possible connection to the Rishikas = Pompeius Trogus remarks that the Asii were lords of the Tochari.

India and Central Asia, 1955, p 24. If he is correct, the Rishikas, Tusharas/Tukharas (Tokharoi/Tokaroi), the Kushanas and the Yuezhi, were probably either a single people, or members of a confederacy.

It calls the modern Tajik race to be descendants of the Tukharas and Kambojas, thus assuming Kambojas as a component of the Tukharas or vice versa (The Cultural Heritage of India: Sri Ramakrishna Centenary Memorial, 1936, p 151).

A unit of justice or court overseen by a pr√©v√¥t was known as a '. Etymology Pr√©v√¥t is a Middle French term that comes from the classical Latin praepositus, meaning \\"person placed in charge\\" (literally \\"positioned in the forefront\\"). History The word pr√©v√¥t (provost) applied to a number of different persons in pre-Revolutionary France. The term referred to a seignorial officer in charge of managing burgh affairs and rural estates and, on a local level, customarily administered justice. Therefore, in Paris, for example, there existed both the \\"Lord Provost of Paris\\" who presided a lower royal court, as well as the very important and influential \\"Provost of the Merchants\\" (pr√©v√¥t des marchands), i.e. the Dean of the City Guilds, who headed traditionally the City Council and the City's merchant companies, thus being de facto a kind of feudal mayor. In addition to these two, there were \\"Provost Marshals\\" a.k.a. \\"Provosts of the Marshals of France\\" (Pr√©v√¥ts des Mar√©chaux de France), the \\"Provost of the Royal Residence\\" (Pr√©v√¥t de l'H√¥tel du Roi), later a.k.a. the \\"Lord High Provost of France\\" (Grand Pr√©v√¥t de France), and the \\"Provost General\\" (Pr√©v√¥t g√©n√©ral) later a.k.a. the \\"Lord High Provost of the Mint\\" (Grand Pr√©v√¥t des Monnaies or de la Monnaie). The role extended into New France, with and in the 17th and 18th centuries. =Royal provosts= The most important and best known provosts, as part of the King's personal aids administering the scattered parts of the royal domain, were the \\"Royal Provosts\\" (Pr√©v√¥ts royaux). The regional title of those provosts varied widely from province to province for traditional reasons: \\"castellans\\" (ch√¢telains) in Normandy and Burgundy and \\"vicars\\" (viguiers) in the South. These titles were retained from earlier times when formerly independent provinces were conquered and subsumed under the French Crown. Royal provosts were created by the Capetian monarchy around the 11th century. Provosts replaced viscounts wherever a viscounty had not been made a fief, making it likely that the domainal provost position was fashioned after the corresponding ecclesiastical provost of cathedral chapters, a charge which was strongly developed in the same era. Royal provostships were double faceted. Provosts were initially entrusted with royal power and carried out the royal part of local administration, including the collection of the Crown's domainal revenues and all taxes and duties owed to the King within a provostship's jurisdiction. Also, they were responsible for military defense such as raising local contingents for royal armies. Also, the provosts administered justice with very limited judicial powers. For instance, they never had any jurisdiction over noblemen or feudal tenants (hommes de fief) who instead fell under the jurisdiction of either a regional royal court (parlement) or their respective lord's court where they were tried before a jury of their peers, that is, the lord's other vassals. Provosts had no jurisdiction over purely rural areas, the pies pays, which instead fell to local lordship jurisdiction or lower royal courts. Basically, Provost jurisdiction was restricted to minor and medium delinquency committed in towns under their control, but was often usurped by Burgh/City courts chaired by burgesses. Until the end of the Old Feudal Regime (ancien r√©gime), a number of \\"Military Provost\\" positions (Pr√©v√¥ts d'√©p√©e, literally \\"Provosts of the Sword\\") survived until being replaced by other judging charges (e.g. lord lieutenants or military auditors) in administering military justice. Since the 11th century, the provosts tended increasingly to make their positions hereditary and thus became more difficult to control. One of the King's great officers, the Great Seneschal, became their supervisor. In the 12th century, the office of provost was put up for bidding, and thereafter provosts were farmers of revenues. The provost thus received the speculative right to collect the King's seignorial revenues within his provostship. This remained his primary role. Short-term appointments also helped stem the heritability of offices. Very early, however, certain provostships were bestowed en garde, i.e., on condition the provost regularly render accounts to the King for his collections. Farmed provostships (pr√©v√¥tes en ferme) were naturally a source of abuse and oppression. Naturally, too, the people were discontent. Joinville told of how under St Louis the provostship of Paris became an accountable provostship (pr√©v√¥t√© en garde). With the death of Louis XI, farmed provostships were still numerous and spurred a remonstrance from the States General in 1484. Charles VIII promised to abolish the office in 1493, but the office is mentioned in the Ordinance of 1498. They disappeared in the 16th century, by which time the provosts had become regular officials, their office, however, being purchasable. Further oversight and weakening of provostships occurred when, to monitor their performance and curtail abuses, the Crown established itinerant justices known as bailies (bailli, plural baillis, from which is derived the English word \\"Bailiff\\") to hear complaints against them. With the office of Great Seneschal vacant after 1191, the bailies became stationary and established themselves as powerful officials superior to provosts. A bailie's district is called a bailliary (bailliage) and included about half a dozen provostships (pr√©v√¥t√©s). When previously impossible appeals of provost judgements were instituted by the Crown, that competence of appeal was given to the bailie. Moreover, in the 14th century, provosts no longer were in charge of collecting domainal revenues, except in farmed provostships, having instead yielded this responsibility to \\"royal receivers\\" (receveurs royaux). Raising local army contingents (ban, draft; and arri√®re-ban, reserve) also passed to bailies. Provosts therefore retained the sole function of inferior judges over vassals with original jurisdiction concurrent with bailies over claims against noblemen and actions reserved for royal courts (cas royaux, royal cases). This followed a precedent established in the chief feudal courts in the 13th and 14th centuries in which summary provostship suits were distinct-guished from solemn bailliary sessions (assises). The provost as judge sat a single bench with sole judicial authority over his Court. He was, however, required to seek the advice of legally-qualified experts (cousellors or attorneys) of his choosing, and, in so doing, was said to \\"summon his council\\" (appelait √† son conseil). In 1578, official magistrates (conseillers-magistrats) were created, but were suppressed by the 1579 Ordinance of Blois. The office was restored in 1609 by simple decree of the King's Council, but it was opposed by the Parlement courts and seems to have been conferred in but few instances. =Provost Marshals= French Provost Marshals were non-judicial officers (officiers de la robe courte, literally \\"officers of the short gown\\") attached to the Marshalry (Mar√©chauss√©e) which under the Old Regime was vested with police authority. It would be replaced after the Revolution of 1789 by the newly created Gendarmerie nationale. Originally, they were assigned to judge crimes committed by people in the army, but over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, they gained the right to judge certain types of misdemeanors and felonies committed by the military and civilians alike. They became fixed with set areas of authority, and the offences falling within their jurisdiction came to be called provost crimes (cas pr√©v√¥taux, literally \\"provostal cases\\"). Provost crimes included high violent crimes and crimes committed by repeat offenders (repris de justice), who were familiarly known as the gibier des pr√©v√¥ts des mar√©chaux (Provost Marshal jailbirds; literally \\"Game of the Provosts of the Marshalls\\"). They had military jurisdiction in regiments without \\"Military Provost\\" (Pr√©v√¥t d'√©p√©e; see above), and their rulings were not appealable. However, the provost was required to consult a certain number of ordinary judges or \\"masters of law\\". As Presidial judges had concurrent jurisdiction with Provost Marshals for non-military cases, the two vied openly to be vested.

There were a group of Sakas called Apa Sakas meaning water dwelling Sakas, probably living around some lake in central Asian steppes. Sakas took part in Kurukshetra War.  References in Mahabharata  =The region called Sakadwipa= Mahabharata mentions about a whole region inhabited by Sakas called Sakadwipa to the north-west of ancient India. There in that region are, many delightful provinces where Siva is worshipped, and thither repair the Siddhas, the Charanas, and the Devas. The people there are virtuous, and all the four orders are devoted to their respective occupations. No instance of theft can be seen there. Freed from decrepitude and death and gifted with long life, the people there grow like rivers during the season of rains. The rivers there are full of sacred water, and Ganga herself, distributed as she hath been into various currents, is there as Sukumari, and Kumari, and Seta, and Keveraka, and Mahanadi and the river Manijala, and Chakshus, and the river Vardhanika, these and many other rivers by thousands and hundreds, all full of sacred water, are there. It is impossible to recount the names and lengths of rivers. As heard by all men there, in that region of Saka, are four sacred provinces. They are the Mrigas, the Masakas, the Manasas, and the Mandagas. The Mrigas for the most part are Brahmanas devoted to the occupations of their order. Amongst the Masakas are virtuous Kshatriyas. The Manasas live by following the duties of the Vaishya order. Having every wish of theirs gratified, they are also brave and firmly devoted to virtue and profit. The Mandagas are all brave Shudras of virtuous behaviour. In these provinces, there is no king, no punishment, no person that deserves to be punished. Conversant with the dictates of duty they are all engaged in the practice of their respective duties and protect one another. This much is capable of being said of the region called Saka. The region called Sakadwipa is mentioned again at (12:14) as a region to the east of the great Karnali mountains. = The tale of Kamadhenu's army = When the sage Vasistha was attacked by king Viswamitra's army, Vasistha's cow, Kamadehnu, brought forth from her tail, an army of Palhavas, and from her udders, an army of Dravidas and Sakas; and from her womb, an army of Yavanas, and from her dung, an army of Savaras; and from her urine, an army of Kanchis; and from her sides, an army of Savaras. And from the froth of her mouth came out hosts of Paundras and Kiratas, Yavanas and Sinhalas, and the barbarous tribes of Khasas and Chivukas and Pulindas and Chinas and Hunas with Keralas, and numerous other Mlechchhas. In the ancient Indian literature, cow is a symbol of earth or land. Thus the myth mentioned above simply means that, these tribes gathered for the protection of sage Vasistha's land against the army of king Viswamitra. This myth indicates that the ancient people were familiar with these Mlechcha tribes who were highly skilled in weapons, warfare and material sciences but never followed the Vedic rites properly. The confusion of ancient Vedic people in dealing with these tribes is evident in the following passage from Mahabharata. At (12:35) is mentioned:- What duties should be performed by the Yavanas, the Kiratas, the Gandharvas, the Chinas, the Savaras, the Barbaras, the Sakas, the Tusharas, the Kankas, the Pathavas, the Andhras, the Madrakas, the Paundras, the Pulindas, the Ramathas, the Kamvojas, the several castes that have sprung up from Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, and the Shudras, that reside in the dominions of (Arya) kings?. They were later given the status of Shudras. It is in consequence of the absence of Brahmanas from among them that the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas and other Kshatriya tribes have become fallen and degraded into the status of Shudras. The Dravidas, the Kalingas, the Pulandas, the Usinaras, the Kolisarpas, the Mahishakas and other Kshatriyas, have, in consequence of the absence of Brahmanas from among their midst, become degraded into Shudras (13:33). =Encounters with the Sakas = Nakula the son of Pandu reduced to subjection the fierce Mlechchas residing on the sea coast, as also the wild tribes of the Palhavas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the Sakas (2:31). They were also vanquished by Krishna:- The Sakas, and the Yavanas with followers, were all vanquished by Krishna. (7:11). Bhima subjugated strategically the Sakas and the barbarians living in that part of the country. And the son of Pandu, sending forth expeditions from Videha, conquered the seven kings of the Kiratas living about the Indra mountain. (2:29). These Sakas seems to be established in the north-east regions of Gangatic plain. These Sakas close to Videha was mentioned at (6:9) in the list of kingdoms of Bharata Varsha (Ancient India). Another colony of Sakas were mentioned close to the Nishadha Kingdom in central India. = Tribute to Yudhishthira = Sakas were mentioned with other tribes, bringing tribute to Yudhishthira (2:50,51). Numberless Chinas and Sakas and Uddras and many barbarous tribes living in the woods, and many Vrishnis and Harahunas, and dusky tribes of the Himavat, and many Nipas and people residing in regions on the sea-coast, waited at the gate. = In Kurukshetra War = Words of Satyaki a commander in the side of Pandavas:- I shall have to encounter the Sakas endued with prowess equal to that of Sakra (Indra) himself, who are fierce as tire, and difficult to put out like a blazing conflagration (7:109). In Kurukshetra War, the Sakas sided with the Kauravas under the Kamboja king Sudakshina. Saka king was reckoned by Drupada in his list of kings to be summoned for the cause of Pandavas in Kurukshetra War (5:4). Sudakshina, the king of the Kambhojas, accompanied by the Yavanas and Sakas, came to the Kuru chief with an Akshauhini of troops (5:19). The Sakas, the Kiratas, and Yavanas, the Sivis and the Vasatis with their Maharathas at the heads of their respective divisions joined the Kaurava army (5:198). The Sakas, the Kiratas, and Yavanas, and the Pahlavas, took up his position at the northern point of the army (6:20). Of terrible deeds and exceedingly fierce, the Tusharas, the Yavanas, the Khasas, the Darvabhisaras, the Daradas, the Sakas, the Kamathas, the Ramathas, the Tanganas the Andhrakas, the Pulindas, the Kiratas of fierce prowess, the Mlecchas, the Parvatas, and the races hailing from the sea-side, all endued with great wrath and great might, delighting in battle and armed with maces, these all united with the Kurus (8:73). Yavanas were armed with bow and arrows and skilled in smiting. They were followed by Sakas and Daradas and Barbaras and Tamraliptakas, and other countless Mlecchas (7:116). Three thousand bowmen headed by Duryodhana, with a number of Sakas and Kamvojas and Valhikas and Yavanas and Paradas, and Kalingas and Tanganas and Amvashtas and Pisachas and Barbaras and Parvatas, inflamed with rage and armed with stone, all rushed against Satyaki (7:118). Sakas were mentioned along with other tribes like the Sudras, the Abhiras, the Daserakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas, the Hangsapadas, the Paradas, the Vahlikas, the Samsthanas, the Surasenas, the Venikas, the Kukkuras, the Rechakas, the Trigartas, the Madrakas, the Tusharas and the Chulikas as battling on the side of Kauravas at various passages. (6:51,75,88, 7:20,90). A number of Saka and Tukhara and Yavana horsemen, accompanied by some of the foremost combatants among the Kambojas, quickly rushed against Arjuna (8:88). All the Samsaptakas, the Kambojas together with the Sakas, the Mlecchas, the Parvatas, and the Yavanas, have also been slain by Arjuna (9:1) = Sakas after Kurukshetra War = A passage which is rendered as a futuristic prediction in Mahabharata mentions thus:- The Sakas, the Pulindas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas, the Valhikas and the Abhiras, will then become possessed of bravery and the sovereignty of the whole earth (3:187).

The school motto is ', Irish for \\"with the gentle hand foremost\\".  History  Sullivan Lower School (equivalent to a primary school in modern terminology) was founded in 1862 by Robert Sullivan. After Sullivan's death in 1868, part of his estate was used to establish the upper school. Originally the two schools were based in Holywood's High Street, The lower school has been moved to a site beside the upper school and is now called Sullivan Prep which is a private school and the upper school has moved to a site on the edge of the town. The original building is now occupied by the town's public library. =The 1994 attack= On 17 June 1994, Garnet Bell, a former pupil, entered the School Hall during an A Level exam carrying an improvised flame thrower, containing petrol and paraffin. Bell discharged the device, burning six pupils, three of them seriously. He was subsequently found guilty of three cases of attempted murder and three of grievous bodily harm, receiving six life sentences.Flamethrower maniac prayed on deathbed The News Letter, 19 December 1997 Bell died in prison of cancer in 1997.  Sports  Sullivan Upper participates in various sports, including rugby, hockey, golf, volleyball, badminton, tennis, and chess. The school won the rugby Medallion Shield in 2001 and 2011, and the 2nd XV cup in 2009, beating Royal School, Armagh 14‚Äì12. Notable former players include David Erskine, a former senior Ireland international lock, and current Ulster and Ireland centre Darren Cave. In hockey, Sullivan won the 1993 Burney Cup, beating Banbridge Academy after sudden death penalty strokes. In 2006 they reached the final again, losing 4‚Äì2. Former team members include Irish senior international player Mark Raphael. In 2009 they also reached the McCullough Cup final for the first time in the school's history. In 2010, the team reached the semi-final of the Burney Cup but lost to Campbell College. In 2017 the school beat Wallace High School 3‚Äì2 in the Burnley cup final, the schools first victory since 1993. The school won the McCullough cup the following year beating friends after a late equaliser from Matthew Willis brought the game to a 2‚Äì2 draw with Fergus Gibson scoring the decisive penalty. The school also managed to reach the Burney Cup final this year but Friends avenged their earlier defeat, with the game again going to penalties. In 2019 Sullivan reached the Burnley cup final for the third year in a row but narrowly lost out to Wallace on penalty runs In cricket, the school reached the Schools Cup final for the first time in their history in 2009, but ended up losing by nine wickets to Foyle and Londonderry College. One notable player was Mark Adair. Sullivan have a golf team competing in various competitions. One notable previous member is Rory McIlroy.  The house system  The school is divided into four houses: Praeger (red), Grant (green), McAlester (blue), Speers (yellow). Two of the houses, Grant and Speers, were named after ex-headmasters of the school, whereas Praeger was named after the sculptress Rosamond Praeger and her brother Robert. McAlester was named after the Rev. McAlester who sat on the Committee of Sullivan Schools in the 1800s when the school was founded. The school's Preparatory Department, however, only contains three of the four houses - Grant house, which was established in the 1974‚Äì75 school year, only exists in the main body of the school. Regular inter-house competitions are held to cultivate house pride, including the House Photography Competition, House Music Competition and Sports Day.  Notable alumni  In 2016, the school launched an alumni directory program to establish a database of past pupils, staff, and governors to allow former pupils and personnel to reconnect. =Academia= * Prof David E.

The person at right in the foreground is in ch≈´dan-no-kamae, the person at left is in j≈çdan-no-kamae. , occasionally Ch≈´dan-gamae, or simply Ch≈´dan as it is shortened to in many Japanese martial arts schools that instruct in the use of the katana (sword). Ch≈´dan-no-kamae translates to \\"middle-level posture\\", it is also called Seigan-no-kamae (Ê≠£Áúº‰πãÊßã) that can be translated to \\"right posture\\". In most traditional schools of swordsmanship, and in the practice of kendo, ch≈´dan-no- kamae is the most basic posture. It provides a balance between attacking and defensive techniques. Kendo Ch≈´dan-no-kamae is one of the five stances in kendo: j≈çdan, ch≈´dan, gedan, hass≈ç and waki. This is the most basic stance in kendo which balances attack and defence. If correctly assumed, the trunk (do) and right wrist (migi-kote) are hidden from the opponent. The throat is visible, but the extended tip of the sword threatens a thrusting enemy with a likely counter-thrust. The head (men) is the only clearly open target, but this too is easily defended. If the kamae is not broken, the user can step into striking distance of the opponent whilst maintaining good defence. A beginner learns this stance first in order to learn the correct striking distance, issoku-itto-no-maai. =Body position= In ch≈´dan-no-kamae, the left foot is slightly behind the right with the left heel slightly raised, both feet are parallel, the hips are straight forward, shoulders are relaxed, spine is perpendicular to the floor at all times. The center of gravity should be centered between both feet. The shinai is held with the hands in front of the waist, with the tip of the weapon pointed at the opponent's throat. Kenjutsu, generally Traditional styles of kenjutsu also use this as a basic stance, the only variation being the footwork. Generally, a much more grounded base is required for proper cutting with power, stability, and focus. Some traditional styles may even assume zenkutsu dachi for their footwork. In contrast, and for example, the kenjutsu taught in the practice of aikido opts for a middle ground, where ch≈´dan-no-kamae is assumed with the body otherwise in hanmi-dachi. The purpose is to reduce the possibility of an ai-uchi (simultaneous strike, usually resulting in mutual death), which often occurs harmlessly in kendo (whoever the judges believe struck the earliest gets the points), but is generally undesirable in actual combat. Other kamae (positions) Some other kamae are: *Gedan-no-kamae *J≈çdan-no-kamae *Hass≈ç-no- kamae *Waki-gamae All of them have a hidari (Â∑¶) left and migi (Âè≥) right version. When indicated, hidari or migi wil be prefixed to the stance, e.g. migi gedan-no-kamae would be Âè≥‰∏ãÊÆµ„ÅÆÊßã„Åà. These are the most standard kamae, and the most widely practiced. Others exist, and as one extreme example, the art of Tenshin Sh≈çden Katori Shint≈ç-ry≈´ practices all of these and at least twice as many others, almost none of which actually use the above names.Otake, Risuke (1977). The Deity and the Sword - Katori Shinto-ryu Vol. 1, Japan, Japan Publications Trading Co. (Original Japanese title for all three volumes in this series is Mukei Bunkazai Katori Shinto-ryu) The five kamae are called fire (j≈çdan), water (ch≈´dan), earth (gedan), wood (hass≈ç) and metal (waki) according to the Five Elements.‰∏äÈáé Èùñ‰πã (1966) Ââ£ÈÅìÊïôÂÖ∏ (Educational Model Fencing) Â∞öÊ≠¶È§®Âàä. p318 European schools of swordsmanship This posture is known as Eisenport or Iron Gate in German martial arts from the 14th through 16th century. This posture is most similar to Posta di Breve or Short Guard in Italian martial arts from the 14th through 16th century. In the late 1500s Camillo Agrippa renamed it to Terza or Third. Agrippa's numeric naming conventions were widely adopted by the start of the 17th century.

(2002) The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Oxford University Press  Biography  Stolz was born of musical parents in Graz. His father was a conductor and a composer, his mother a concert pianist, and he was the great-nephew of the soprano Teresa Stolz. At the age of seven, he toured Europe as a pianist, playing Mozart.The Oxford Dictionary of Music 2nd ed. (1995), Oxford University Press He studied at the Vienna Conservatory with Robert Fuchs and Engelbert Humperdinck. From 1899 he held successive conducting posts at Maribor (then called Marburg), Salzburg and Brno before succeeding Artur Bodanzky at the Theater an der Wien in 1907. There he conducted, among other pieces, the first performance of Oscar Straus's Der tapfere Soldat (The Chocolate Soldier) in 1908, before leaving in 1910 to become a freelance composer and conductor. Meanwhile, he had begun to compose operettas and individual songs and had a number of successes in these fields. After serving in the Austrian Army in World War I, Stolz devoted himself mainly to cabaret, and moved to Berlin in 1925. Around 1930, he started to compose music for films, such as the first German sound film Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt (Two Hearts in Waltz Time), of which the title-waltz rapidly became a popular favourite. Some earlier Stolz compositions, such as \\"Adieu, mein kleiner Gardeoffizier\\" from his operetta Die lustigen Weiber von Wien, became known to wider audiences through the medium of film, after it was interpolated into Im wei√üen R√∂√ül (The White Horse Inn). The rise of Nazi Germany led Stolz to return to Vienna, where his title- song for the film Ungek√ºsst soll man nicht schlafen gehn was a hit. He remained active in Berlin as well. He used to travel by car between the two cities, so he smuggled Jews and political refugees across the German-Austrian border in the trunk of his limousine. He managed to do so 21 times. Then came the Anschluss, and he moved again, first to Z√ºrich and then to Paris, where in 1939 he was interned as an enemy alien. With the help of friends he was released and in 1940 made his way to New York. Viennese City Park In America, Stolz achieved fame with his concerts of Viennese music, starting with \\"A Night in Vienna\\" at Carnegie Hall. As a result, he received many invitations to compose music for shows and films, and he received two Academy Awards nominations: \\"Waltzing in the Clouds\\" for Spring Parade was nominated for Best Original Song in 1941, and his score for It Happened Tomorrow was nominated for Best Dramatic or Comedy Picture Score in 1945. In 1946 Stolz returned to Vienna, where he lived for the rest of his life. In the 1960s and 1970s he made numerous recordings of operettas by composers such as Johann Strauss, Franz Leh√°r, Emmerich K√°lm√°n, and Leo Fall, whom he had known previously. In 1952, he began to compose for the Vienna Ice Revue. He dedicated his first of 19 ice operettas (\\"Eternal Eve\\") to European Champion Eva Pawlik. In 1970, to mark his 90th birthday, he was made an Honorary Citizen of Vienna. He was also awarded Vienna's Grand Medal of Honour, being only the second musician ever to be so honoured (after Richard Strauss). He also appeared on a series of commemorative Austrian postage stamps. In later years he used a baton inherited from Franz Leh√°r, which had been originally owned by Johann Strauss and contained Strauss's initials engraved in silver. After his death in Berlin in 1975, Robert Stolz received the honour of a lying-in-state in the foyer of the Vienna State Opera House. He was buried near Johannes Brahms and Johann Strauss II in Vienna's Zentralfriedhof, and a statue to him was erected in the Wiener Stadtpark. A street is named after him - just off the Opernring in Vienna, close to the State Opera. Marriages Robert Stolz was married five times. His first and second wives (Grete Holm and Franzi Ressel), were singers. His third wife was Josephine Zernitz and the fourth was named Lilli. His fifth wife Yvonne Louise Ulrich, called \\"Einzi\\" (1912-2004) or \\"die Einzige\\", for her role assisting German and Austrian artists in exile in Paris during the Second World War, was his manager until his death. She had one daughter from her first marriage, whom Robert Stolz adopted: Clarissa. Robert Stolz's grandchildren are French writer Natacha Henry and entrepreneur and financier Nick Henry-Stolz.\\"Trauer in Wien:Witwen- Legende Einzi Stolz ist tot\\" (\\"Mourning in Vienna:Legendary Widow 'Einzi' Stolz is Dead\\") in News (28 January 2004), accessed 25 December 2010  Selected operettas  *Das Gl√ºcksm√§del (1910) * Der Tanz ins Gl√ºck (The Dance into Happiness) (1921) * Im wei√üen R√∂√ül (The White Horse Inn) (1930), jointly with Ralph Benatzky * Wenn die kleinen Veilchen bl√ºhen (When the Little Violets Bloom or Wild Violets) (1932) * Der verlorene Walzer, a stage version of the film Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt (1933)  Selected songs  Robert Stolz Memorial at the Prater *\\"Servus Du\\" (1912) words by Benno Vigny *\\"Wien wird erst sch√∂n bei Nacht\\" words by *\\"Im Prater bl√ºhn wieder die B√§ume\\" words by Kurt Robitschek *\\"Das ist der Fr√ºhling in Wien\\" words by Arthur Rebner *\\"Du, du, du sollst der Kaiser meiner Seele sein.\\" (1916) *\\"Hallo, du s√ºsse Klingelfee\\" (1919) words by Arthur Rebner *\\"Salome, sch√∂nste Blume des Morgenlands\\" (1920) words by Arthur Rebner *\\"Ich will deine Kameradin sein\\" words by Walter Reisch *\\"Die ganze Welt ist himmelblau\\" words by Robert Gilbert *\\"Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt\\" (Two Hearts in 3/4 Time) words by Walter Reisch *\\"Das Lied ist aus\\" (Frag nicht warum) (1930) with words by Walter ReischDiscogs from the 1930 film The Song Is Ended directed by G√©za von Bolv√°ry *\\"Wiener-Caf√©\\" (Waltz) *\\"Adieu mein kleiner Gardeoffizier\\" words by Bruno Balz Selected filmography * Two Hearts in Waltz Time (1930) * Hocuspocus (1930) * The Song Is Ended (1930) * The Merry Wives of Vienna (1931) * The Theft of the Mona Lisa (1931) * Madame Pompadour (1931) * The Prince of Arcadia (1932) * A Man with Heart (1932) * I Do Not Want to Know Who You Are (1932) * What Women Dream (1933) * My Heart Calls You (1934) * Two Hearts in Waltz Time (1934) * My Heart Is Calling You (1934) * Spring Parade (1934) * Adventure on the Southern Express (1934) * The Gentleman Without a Residence (1934) * Circus Saran (1935) * Heaven on Earth (1935) * The Charm of La Boheme (1937) * Who's Your Lady Friend?

Professional career During his pro career, Weis played with Unicaja M√°laga and Iurbentia Bilbao of the Spanish ACB League, PAOK Thessaloniki in the Greek League, and Limoges in the French League. On 28 January 2009 Iurbentia Bilbao waived him, after he missed 3 games in a row, due to his health, and on 13 February he signed with ViveMenorca. He was drafted by the New York Knicks, with the 15th pick in the first round, of the 1999 NBA draft, but he did not sign with them, and never played in the NBA. The draft pick angered many Knicks fans, because Ron Artest, who had grown up in Queens, New York, and played for St. John's University, was still available. Artest was taken with the next pick by the Chicago Bulls. Weis took part in the NBA Summer League, and then declined to sign a rookie contract, being convinced by his agent - who was also a minority owner of Weis's team, Limoges - to return to France. Weis ended up never playing in an NBA game, later stating that in spite of his interest in going to North America, the Knicks never directly contacted him about returning. On 29 August 2008 Weis's draft rights were traded from the New York Knicks, to the Houston Rockets, for Patrick Ewing Jr. In March 2011 he announced his retirement. National team career Weis won the silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, with the senior French national basketball team. With France's national team he played at the following EuroBaskets: the 1999 EuroBasket, the 2001 EuroBasket, the 2005 EuroBasket, and the 2007 EuroBasket. At the 2005 EuroBasket, Weis won the bronze medal with his national team. He also played with France's national team at the 2006 FIBA World Championship.Fr√©d√©ric WEIS (FRA) participated in 13 FIBA / FIBA Zones events. =\\"Le dunk de la mort\\"= Weis is known for having been posterized by the United States' Vince Carter, during a basketball game between the U.S. and France at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games on 25 September 2000. After getting the ball off a steal, the 6'6\\" (1.98 m) Carter drove to the basket and spread his legs as he jumped over the 7'2\\" (2.18 m) Weis before dunking the ball ferociously. The French media dubbed the slam \\"le dunk de la mort\\": \\"the dunk of death\\". The U.S. won the game 106‚Äì94. In an ESPN story published on the 15th anniversary of the dunk, Weis said that Carter \\"deserves to make history. Sadly for me, I was on the video, too. I learned people can fly.\\" Personal life In 2002, Weis' wife, Celia, gave birth to a son, Enzo, while Weis was playing in Spain. After Enzo was diagnosed with autism as a toddler, Weis spiraled into alcoholism and depression, and Celia took their son and returned to France. In 2008, Weis drove to a rest stop in Biarritz, and attempted suicide, by intentionally overdosing on sleeping pills.

According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Lewis has a net worth of ¬£4.358 billion, an increase of ¬£462 million from 2018. Lewis is also majority owner of Premier League football team Tottenham Hotspur. Early life Lewis was born to a JewishEuropean Jewish Press: \\"Jewish businessmen prominent in British 'Rich List'\\" 24 April 2006Wall Street Journal: \\"Star of David, For Entertainment Only\\" 11 November 2012 family above a public house in Roman Road, Bow, London. Lewis left school at 15 to help run his father's West End catering business, Tavistock Banqueting. When he took the reins, he quickly expanded it by selling luxury goods to American tourists, and also owned West End club the Hanover Grand, where he gave Robert Earl his first job. He later sold the business in 1979 to make his initial wealth. Currency trading After selling the family business in the late 1970s, Lewis moved into currency trading in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in his move to the Bahamas where he is now a tax exile. In September 1992, Lewis teamed up with George Soros to bet on the pound crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The event, which was dubbed Black Wednesday, made Lewis very wealthy, and some say he made more than Soros.Bowers, Simon. \\"Profile: Joe Lewis\\", The Guardian, 14 September 2007. Lewis is still an active foreign exchange trader. Tavistock Group Lewis is the main investor in Tavistock Group, which owns more than 200 companies in 15 countries. Tavistock Group's portfolio includes: *Lake Nona Medical City *Life sciences *Sports teams: Tottenham Hotspur via ENIC Group. Formerly owned stakes in Glasgow Rangers F.C. and Slavia Prague. *Sporting events: Tavistock Cup, Isleworth Collegiate Invitational *Manufacturing and distribution: Top Outlet and puma *Oil, gas and energy: BayCorp, Pampa Energia *Financial services *Restaurants: Freebirds World Burrito, Abe & Louie's, Mitchells & Butlers plc, Zed451 *Commercial property: Tamar Capital, Bulgarian Property Development *Private luxury residential property: Isleworth Golf & Country Club, Lake Nona Golf & Country Club *Resort property: Albany, Harmony Cove, The St. Regis Atlanta, Pier Sixty-Six Hotel & Marina. =Property= Lewis hosted the Tavistock Cup tournament every March from 2004 through 2013,; in Florida, raising millions of dollars for charity, and owns three of the six clubs that competed in 2013:Tavistock press release, 2013 Albany, Lake Nona Golf & Country Club and Isleworth Golf & Country Club. Lewis built a golf community in the Bahamas called Albany, which opened in October 2010. Tiger Woods and Ernie Els are also major shareholders in the luxury resort community located in New Providence. Lewis made a ¬£70 million investment in Bulgarian property development. Lake Nona Medical City Lewis seeded Lake Nona, covering 7,000 acres next to Orlando's international airport, with $100 million in gifts and land which was cultivated into a large-scale community offering research and educational facilities, hospitals for veterans and children, a town center, and a range of workspaces and residential options. Escondido Lake and controversy Since Lewis bought a property in R√≠o Negro Province, Argentina, public access to Escondido lake has been under discussion. The Argentine law asserts that every water course is public and of free access.¬øQui√©n es Joe Lewis, el magnate due√±o de Lago Escondido?, Clar√≠n, 26 March 2016. In 2009 Lewis was ordered by the Superior Tribunal de Justicia (STJ) to create and keep access to the lake, with \\"sufficient signage and to keep it transitable\\", but the ruling has not been enforced. Lewis' frontman Van Ditmer stated: \\"We are going to defend the private property with the Winchester in the hands; with blood if needed\\". Lewis' property encircles the lake. While some have called for another public mountain trail to be built to access the lake, El Consejo de Ecolog√≠a y Medio Ambiente de R√≠o Negro (the Council of Ecology and Environment of R√≠o Negro) does not support building another pass, which would cause harm to the environmentally protected area. He is currently planning to use a huge protected area, four times the size of the city of Buenos Aires, for another private development, against the wishes of the locals. The property was bought for 69 pesos per hectare, currently about US$4. This low price was secured by using the name of a local 'poblador' on the deed, after which it was transferred to him. It is suggested that the Hidden Lake property is needed to supply water and (hydraulic) energy to this new property, dubbed the private state in Patagonia. In January 2017, new mass protests have started in El Bolson against this project. =Bear Stearns= On 10 September 2007, Lewis paid US$860.4 million in an all-cash purchase of a 7% stake in Bear Stearns. By December 2007 Lewis had raised his stake at the brokerage firm to 9.4%, a total of 11 million shares, for which he paid an average price of $107 apiece. After the purchase of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan for $10 a share, it was estimated that Lewis lost $1.16 billion on his investment. =Mitchells & Butlers= Lewis is the largest shareholder in the British public house group Mitchells & Butlers, controlling 26.85% of the issued share capital through his investment vehicle Piedmont, which he built up since 2008.The Jewish Chronicle: \\"Joe Lewis still has that midas touch\\" by Alex Brummer 10 June 2010 It was reported on 27 August 2011 that Lewis had made a zero premium proposal for the pub group of 224p a share.

Structure The hemiazygos vein and the accessory hemiazygos vein, when taken together, essentially serve as the left-sided equivalent of the azygos vein. That is, the azygos vein serves to drain most of the posterior intercostal veins on the right side of the body, and the hemiazygos vein and the accessory hemiazygos vein drain most of the posterior intercostal veins on the left side of the body. Specifically, the hemiazygos vein mirrors the bottom part of the azygos vein. The structure of the hemiazygos vein is often variable. It usually begins in the left ascending lumbar vein or renal vein, and passes upward through the left crus of the diaphragm to enter the thorax. It continues ascending on the left side of the vertebral column, and around the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra, it passes rightward across the column, behind the aorta, esophagus, and thoracic duct, to end in the azygos vein. The hemiazygos may or may not be continuous superiorly with the accessory hemiazygos vein. It receives the 9th, 10th, and 11th posterior intercostal veins and the subcostal vein of the left side, and some esophageal and mediastinal veins. The dilated hemiazygos system displayed by chest or abdominal X-ray films can be misdiagnosed as a mediastinal or retroperitoneal neoplasm, lymphadenopathy or aortic dissection (2, 5‚Äì7, 10). Venostasis which is the consequence of pathological conditions such as acquired obstruction of the IVC or SVC, the right heart failure, portal hypertension or due to pregnancy can have the same clinical presentation as hemiazygos continuation of the IVC (5, 6, 10, 13). In the case of hemiazygos continuation of the IVC, the hepatic veins can drain directly into the right atrium (3, 10). An incidental finding of this condition during venous cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass complicates the procedure, since no solid IVC trunk for placing the cannula is present. Separate cannulation of the SVC and the right atrium should be used in this case. History The name for this vein is derived from that of the azygos vein. Azygos means 'unpaired', and hemi means half. This vein mirrors the bottom half of the azygos vein.

Biography David Tartakover was born in Haifa in 1944. His father, Dr. Jacob Tartakover, was a lawyer. His mother, Alexandra Shulamit Tarkatover (originally Gluckstein), was a teacher and the sister of Tony Cliff. When he was four, the family moved to Jerusalem, where he attended high school. Between 1962 and 1964, he served in the Israel Defense Forces in the Paratroopers Brigade. He later fought as a reservist in the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Tartakover studied at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, and is a graduate of the London College of Printing. Artistic career Since 1975, Tartakover has operated his own studio in Tel Aviv, specializing in various aspects of visual communications, with particular emphasis on culture and politics. From 1976, Tatakover has been a senior lecturer in the Visual Communication Department of the Bezalel Academy, is a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale (AGI), has been a president of the Graphic Designers Association of Israel (GDAI). He has established a reputation for a series of politically provocative self-produced posters, some at the time of Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish new year). His compositions are driven more by content or themes than by high aesthetics. He has described his work as a \\"seismograph\\" and \\"a way of reacting to events... to alter opinions and attitudes\\". Tartakover designed Peace Now's logo in 1978. The logo emerged from a poster created by Tartakover for a mass rally, held in what is now Rabin Square in Tel Aviv on April 1, 1978, titled \\"Peace Now.\\" It became the name of the organization, the first political bumper sticker in Israel and it is still one of Israel's most popular stickers. Tartakover, commenting in 2006, said \\"The movement activists liked the logo, [b]ut they thought there should also be a symbol. I told them it wasn't needed - this is the symbol. It took time until they understood that this was the first political sticker in Israel.\\" The logo combines two typefaces, \\"Shalom\\" (peace) in black traditional Koren Bible Type (designed by Eliyahu Koren) and \\"Achshav\\" (now) in the red headline-style Haim Type (designed by Jan Le Witt). He describes himself as \\"a local designer,\\" meaning that the subjects he tackles concern Israel. He follows the mantra of Hebrew expressionist poet Avigdor Hameiri (b. Andor Feuerstein): \\"Freedom of opinion is not a right but a duty\\". Influences on Tartakover's work stem from Gustav Klutsis, John Heartfield, Alexander Rodchenko, Ben Shahn, and Andy Warhol. He claims that his mentor has been comic-book artist Bob Gill and that best work is the Hebrew-lettered \\"Peace Now\\" logo. Tatakover is one of the most prominent Israeli graphic designers; others include Franz Kraus (1905‚Äì1998), Gabriel and Maxim Shamir (1909‚Äì1992, 1910‚Äì1990), and Dan Reisinger (1934‚Äì2019).

The judges said, \\"His unique work creates a synthesis between popular and high culture, between the written text and visual imagery, and between personal statements and collective representations of local cultural values. As a creator, teacher, and an active member of the community for over thirty years, he has influenced the language of visual representation in Israel.\\" His work has won numerous awards and prizes and is included in the collections of museums in Europe, U.S. and Japan.

Having seized the Bridgewater Works at Chippawa, Durand purchased the operation from his employers. He also established a trading depot near Long Point. In 1810, he sold the operation at Chippawa due to a downturn in the produce market. He served in the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812. In 1815, he became the representative for West York in the 6th Parliament of Upper Canada in a by-election after Abraham Markle joined the Americans. Durand criticized the introduction of martial law during the war. With John Willson, he drafted the Common Schools Act of 1816, which introduced public support of elementary schools. He also helped establish the Gore District with Hamilton as the district town. In 1817, he was elected in the riding of Wentworth and served until 1820. He was a partner in the Desjardins Canal Company, expanded his land holdings and built sawmills to process his timber holdings. He died in Hamilton, Ontario in 1833.

In 1907 The Welsh Northern Rugby Football Union was formed in Wrexham, but the English Northern Rugby Football Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the south of Wales and the Welsh body soon folded. In 1926 the English body, now called the Rugby Football League (RFL) formed a Welsh commission in an attempt to convert rugby union clubs to rugby league. The Wales Rugby League achieved governing body status in 2005 and employed its first professional chairman, Mark Rowley, in 2006. The WRL is responsible for the running of the game in Wales, for organising games and competitions and for selecting the squad for the national teams. In addition to managing professional and amateur national representative senior teams, WRL runs several age grade international sides from under 13s to a student team. The senior teams each play in annual European competitions, and the professional side compete in the World Cup every 4 years. In 2006 the WRL achieved autonomous status from the Rugby Football League. In 2010, at a meeting of the Rugby League International Federation in Melbourne, Australia, the WRL were made full members of the Federation.

It is the sequel to Wow Entertainment's Racing Game Sega GT, released in 2002 as Sega's take on the PlayStation 2's highly successful Gran Turismo 3. The game was originally intended to be released for the Dreamcast, but when the Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the game was reprogrammed for the Xbox. Following its initial release as a retail game, it was given away on a disk with Jet Set Radio Future in specially-marked Xbox console packages. Sega released Sega GT Online for the following year, with extra cars and an online facility to be used with the Xbox Live. Despite being an Xbox exclusive, the franchise would later die off and as a result, the Forza Motorsport series would later come to Xbox starting in 2005, and would later have sequels to counter the Gran Turismo franchise. Sega GT 2002 introduced plenty of innovative features, many of which were later adopted by future games of its kind. Game features This is the only GT-style game that allows the player to select their opponents directly. Unlike the original game, there are no works cars to win anymore, even though old racing cars can still be won from races. Some prizes are \\"special prizes\\" that can only be won by doing a certain objective. The game makes use of a \\"damage meter\\" in lieu of rendered damage, but while it does not affect the handling, it will reduce the awarded prize money at the end of the race. When the player finishes the race with the car unscratched, the game will award a bonus cash prize.

Biography He was born at Astley, just south of the town of Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire, and was from a yeoman family. He was apprenticed to a linen draper in Worcester circa 1632, but left after a few years to live a country life. According to John Aubrey he died violently; 'The cause of death was a beating and thrown into a tub of water'. = Civil War Period = During the English Civil War he served in the Parliamentary army rising to the rank of captain. In 1646 he became a member of the Worcester County Committee to administer \\"parliamentary justice\\" to the county and to list and fine all \\"delinquents\\" who had supported the Royalist cause.*Inett. What's in a name?, Edward Inett, 2010 Rock and District News pp25-28. After the war, he used the arrears of military pay to speculate in forfeited crown and royalist estates. With other officers, he set up ironworks, a blast furnace at Astley, to smelt cinders from Worcester with iron ore from the Forest of Dean, using charcoal obtained locally. Neighbouring ironmasters leased Shelsley Forge to him to discourage him from building one of his own. He probably withdrew from the iron industry after the Restoration. However he still had a share in a furnace at Sudeley near Winchcombe in 1673. Yarranton had been a leading Roundhead before the Restoration and was therefore under political suspicion afterwards. He was imprisoned several times during the 1660s, at least twice on trumped up charges. His other achievement related to making tinplate. The Stour Navigation proprietors, and certain notable men in the local iron industry commissioned him and Ambrose Crowley to go to Saxony to find out how tinplate was made. On their return, experiments were undertaken, including rolling (which was not part of the process in Saxony). This was sufficiently successful to encourage two of the sponsors Philip Foley and Joshua Newborough to set up a mill for the process on the Stour at Wolverley. = Agriculture = Engineering Yarranton is mainly remembered as a navigation engineer. His first interest in this was a proposal in 1651 to make Dick Brook navigable*Inett. What's in a name?, Edward Inett, 2010 Rock and District News p32. from the River Severn to a forge and furnace he owned on the Astley bank of the brook. In 1655 he proposed to make the River Salwarpe navigable from the Severn to Droitwich. This was partly to be financed with money raised by the town corporation, but came to nothing. However the proposal was revived in 1662, and an Act of Parliament was obtained authorising the improvement of the Stour and Salwarpe. Droitwich Corporation renewed its agreement in 1664, to provide financial assistance to Thomas Lord Windsor (later Earl of Plymouth), who was the scheme's leading financier. However, when five of the six locks had been built the proposal was found 'not to answer' and was abandoned. A century later the Droitwich Canal was built to fulfil the same objective, primarily that of bringing coal up to Droitwich to boil brine and taking the resultant salt out. The River Stour, Worcestershire flows through Stourbridge and Kidderminster to join the Severn at Stourport-on-Severn (which was then the hamlet of Lower Mitton). The proposal was that coal from Amblecote and Pennsnett Chase should be brought down railways (known as footrayles) and loaded on to barges to transport down the river. Several attempts were made to improve the river, but each time money ran out, either before it was finished or before a trade could be got going. These lasted intermittently until 1680, the later ones being under the immediate supervision of Andrew's son Robert Yarranton. The scheme was thus ultimately a failure, but its objectives were achieved at much greater expense a century later by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the Stourbridge Canal. Yarranton's work on a third navigation, the River Avon, was far more successful. William Sandys had improved the river in the late 1630s, but it had passed into the hands of Willam Say (one of his financiers), who was attainted at the Restoration (thus forfeiting his property). His rights passed to James, Duke of York, later King James II, who sold them to Lord Windsor in 1664. The navigation had languished under its previous ownership and needed substantial further investment. Lord Windsor retained the Lower Avon (below Evesham) himself, but employed Yarranton to maintain it, and also to rebuild Pershore sluice (i.e. lock). The Upper Avon Navigation (above Evesham) needed much more to be spent on it, and he took partners, including Yarranton. Within a couple of years, the river was again navigable, and remained so for over two centuries above Evesham, and ever since below that town. References A. W.

Based on a recovery model, common elements of the Soteria approach include primarily non- medical staffing; preserving resident's personal power, social networks, and communal responsibilities; finding meaning in the subjective experience of psychosis by \\"being with\\" clients; and no or minimal use of antipsychotic medication (with any medication taken from a position of choice and without coercion). Soterias are open‚Äîthey had no restraint facilities for young psychotic patients, mostly at their onset. Loren Mosher, who founded the Soteria experience, showed that treating psychosis also in the acute phase is possible without using restraint methods. Soteria houses are often seen as gentler alternatives to a psychiatric hospital system perceived as authoritarian, hostile or violent and based on routine use of psychiatric (particularly antipsychotic) drugs. Soteria houses are sometimes used as \\"early intervention\\" or \\"crisis resolution\\" services.  Theoretical model  Former patients declared that they needed \\"love and food and understanding, not drugs\\", and the Soteria Project was meant to compare results of the methods. Functioning of most psychiatric wards is principally based on the medical model. Doctors possess decision-making powers and final authority; primary therapeutic value is attached to drugs used extensively; patients are considered as having an illness, with concomitant disability and dysfunction which should be \\"treated\\" and \\"cured\\"; labeling and its consequences, namely stigmatization and objectification, are almost inevitable. At Soteria, in contrast, the primary focus was on development, learning, and growth. History The original Soteria Research Project was founded by psychiatrist Loren Mosher in San Jose, California in 1971. A replication facility (\\"Emanon\\") opened in 1974 in another suburban San Francisco Bay Area city. Loren Mosher was influenced by the philosophy of moral treatment, previous experimental therapeutic communities (such as the Fairweather Lodges), the workSullivan HS (1962) Schizophrenia as a human process. New York: Norton. of Harry Stack Sullivan, and Freudian psychoanalysis. The name Soteria comes from the Greek Œ£œâœÑŒ∑œÅŒØŒ± for \\"salvation\\" or \\"deliverance\\" (see Soter). Mosher's first Soteria house specifically selected unmarried subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 who had recently been diagnosed as meeting the DSM-II criteria for schizophrenia. Staff members at the house were encouraged to treat residents as peers and to share household chores. The program was designed to create a quiet, calming environment that respected and tolerated individual differences and autonomy. There was also an ethos of shared responsibility for the running of the house and playing a part in a mutually-supportive community, with the distinction between experts and non-experts downplayed (similar to therapeutic communities). Psychotropic medication, including anti-psychotics, were not completely rejected and were used in some circumstances. The Soteria staff, compared to staff in other psychiatric services, were found to possess significantly more intuition, introversion, flexibility, and tolerance of altered states of consciousness. The Soteria project was admired by many professionals around the world who aspired to create mental health services based on a social, as opposed to a medical, model. It was also heavily criticized as irresponsible or ineffective. The US Soteria Project closed as a clinical program in 1983 due to lack of financial support, although it became the subject of research evaluation with competing claims and analysis. Second generation US successors to the original Soteria house called Crossing Place is still active, although more focused on medication management. A first European near-replication of the original Soteria approach was implemented in 1984 in Berne, Switzerland, on a somewhat different conceptual basis. Three Soteria-like environments focused on longer term rehabilitation were created in Sweden (Perris, 1989). Writing in 1999, Mosher described the core of Soteria as \\"the 24 hour a day application of interpersonal phenomenologic interventions by a nonprofessional staff, usually without neuroleptic drug treatment, in the context of a small, homelike, quiet, supportive, protective, and tolerant social environment.\\" More recent adaptions sometimes employed professional staff. The Soteria approach has traditionally been applied to the treatment of those given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Current Soteria work Soteria or Soteria-based houses are currently run in Sweden,Perris, C.M. Cognitive Therapy with Schizophrenic Patients. Guilford, New York, NY, 1989. Finland,Soteria - kristillinen terapiakeskus Germany,Allgemeine Psychiatrie I / SoteriaToll - HausSoteria Switzerland,Soteria Bern HungarySoteria Alap√≠tv√°ny, the United States,https://www.pathwaysvermont.org/what-we-do/our-programs/soteria/ and some other countries. ‚ÄúSoteria Berne‚Äù located in the center of Berne started functioning on 1 May 1984 in a 12-room house surrounded with a garden. In the house, a maximum of six-eight patients and two nurses can be accommodated. Admitted patients had to meet the following criteria: # aged 17‚Äì35; # a recent onset of schizophreniform or schizophrenic psychosis defined by using DSM- III-R criteria, not more than one year before admission; # at least two of the following six symptoms within the previous four weeks: severely deviant social behaviors, schizophrenic disorders of affect, catatonia, thought disorders, hallucinations, delusions. Research at Soteria Berne found that most acute schizophrenia patients can be as successfully treated as by standard hospital proceedings, but with significantly lower doses of anti-psychotics and without higher daily costs. In addition, the Soteria approach appeared to offer certain advantages mainly located at the subjective-emotional, familial and social level. In the context of increasing interest in the Soteria approach in the United Kingdom, several European countries, North America, and Australasia, a review of controlled trials suggested the Soteria paradigm yields equal, and in certain specific areas better, results in the treatment of people diagnosed with first- or second-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders (and with considerably lower use of medication) when compared with conventional, medication-based approaches. A reevaluation of the approach was called for.

Elevated plasma levels of androgen testosterone and 11-Ketotesterone are associated with the heighten levels of aggression shown by the males.Pankhurst, N. W. (1995).

straddling the boundary between Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, in the community of Wenvoe. The district is centred on a major traffic roundabout that links West Cardiff to the M4 motorway and is home to a number of different retail outlets, and formerly ITV Wales's headquarters. History According to place-name etymologist Deric Meidrum John,http://www.someplacenamesinsouthwales.4t.com/rich_text_1.html there has been a crossroads at Culverhouse Cross for some centuries, originally at the intersection of the Cardiff to Cowbridge turnpike and the road between the parishes of St Fagans and Wenvoe. He states that a farmhouse by the name Culverhouse existed nearby and that the word Culver refers to a pigeon. The Welsh equivalent name Cwrlwys was apparently recorded in 1776. Research at British History Online shows that the word Culverhouse may also refer to a dovecot. The Coedarhydyglyn estate, seat of numerous local prominent men from 1767 onwards, is located at the top of the Tumble Hill above the crossroads. ITV Wales studios Significant commercial and retail development of the area began in 1984 when HTV, the local commercial television contractor at that time, established television headquarters, studios and related facilities near the village of Wenvoe. Renamed ITV Wales, the company downsized and relocated to Cardiff Bay in 2014, and the entire Culverhouse Cross studio, technical and office complex was demolished in April 2015. Tesco was the first store to be built in Culverhouse Cross in 1986, which preceded a decade of rapid development in the suburb because of its accessible location. Demolition of the old Tesco superstore began in March 2007 and operated out of a temporary structure while a new Tesco Extra was built in its place. This opened on 22 October 2007.  Retail parks  All retail parks are situated on or very close to the main roundabout. Valegate Retail Park forms around the A48 westbound exit of the roundabout towards Cowbridge and Bridgend.

The Famine of 1866‚Äì1868 was the last famine in Finland, and (along with the subsequent Swedish famine of 1867-1869) the last major naturally caused famine in Europe. In Finland the famine is known as \\"the great hunger years\\", or . About 8.5% of the entire population died of hunger; in the hardest-hit areas up to 20%. The total death toll was 270,000 in three years, about 150,000 in excess of normal mortality. The worst-hit areas were Satakunta, Tavastia, Ostrobothnia, and North Karelia. Causes Parts of the country had suffered poor harvests in previous years, most notably in 1862. The summer of 1866 was extremely rainy, and staple crops failed widely: potatoes and root vegetables rotted in the fields, and conditions for sowing grain in the autumn were unfavourable. When stored food ran out, thousands took to the roads to beg. The following winter was hard, and spring was late. In Helsinki, the average temperature in May 1867 was +, about below the long- time average and by far the coldest such month in the meteorological record. In many places, lakes and rivers remained frozen until June. After a promisingly warm midsummer, freezing temperatures in early September ravaged crops; as a result, the harvest was about half the average. By the autumn of 1867, people were dying by the thousands. Actions The government of the Grand Duchy of Finland was ill-equipped to handle a crisis of such magnitude. There was no money readily available to import food from largely monopolized Central European markets, and the government was slow to recognize the severity of the situation. Finance minister Johan Vilhelm Snellman, in particular, did not want to borrow, lest Finland's recently introduced currency, the Finnish markka, be weakened because of high interest rates. When money was finally borrowed from the Rothschild bank of Frankfurt in late 1867, the crisis was already full blown, and grain prices had risen in Europe. In addition, it was difficult to transport what little aid could be mustered in a country with poor communications. A number of emergency public works projects were set up, foremost among them the construction of the railway line from Riihim√§ki to Saint Petersburg. Aftermath The weather returned to normal in 1868, and that year's harvest was somewhat better than average, yet, contagious diseases that had spread in the previous year took many additional lives. Programs were launched to increase the diversity of Finnish agriculture, and rapidly improving communications made a recurrence of such a famine less likely. In general, ordinary Finns at the time saw the famine as an act of God. Few would have expected the crown to be able to do much more, and blame was directed mainly at local officials. No significant working class political movement had developed yet that could have capitalized politically on the crisis. The urban population was small, and for the people of the countryside, the first priority was to resume normal lives. In short, the famine did not threaten the social order, but its memory cast a long shadow.

In Cook Islands mythology, Varima-te-takere (\\"goddess of the beginning\\") also called Vari ( ), was the primordial mother of the gods and mortals. According to Gill, Vari, a female spirit or demon of flesh and blood, was admitted to the lowest depth of the interior of Avaiki, a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell. Such is the narrowness of her territory that her knees and chin touch, no other position being possible. Her name in full, Vari-ma- te-takere, Gill translates as \\"The very beginning\\". The word vari, however, also means \\"mud\\", and, taken in conjunction with takere (canoe bottom or keel), the name literally means \\"The mud at the bottom\\"; suggesting the mud on the bottom of Avaiki. Vari is the mud of taro swamps and connotes potential plant growth. As applied to a female, it means menstruation and conveys a connection with the female womb and the origin of human growth. The following passage from a dramatic song of creation (circa 1790) mentions Vari: > But we have no father whatever: > Vari alone made us. > That home of Vari is > The very narrowest of all! > Vari's home is in the narrowest of spaces, > A goddess feeding on raw taro > At appointed periods of worship! > Thy mother, Vatea, is self-existent. Vari was very anxious for progeny. At various times she created six children, three bits of flesh were plucked from each side of her body, and moulded into human form. These six are the primary gods of the universe. Yet no marae or image was ever sacred to them, nor was any offering made to them. These gods are: Vatea (or Avatea), the father of gods and men; Tinirau, lord of the seas; Tango, lord of the birds; Tumu-te-ana-oa, echo of the rocks; Raka, lord of the winds; and Tu-metua, a beloved daughter whom Vari kept close to her in Avaiki. Tu-metua (or Tu-papa) was the tutelary deity of the island of Moorea, and the fourteenth night in every moon was sacred to her.

Al- øƒÄ·∏çid became a minority caliph on the death of his cousin Al-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah (r. 1154‚Äì60), who also had been a minority caliph. The de facto ruler of the time was the vizier, Tala'i ibn Ruzzik, who had taken to himself the honorific title al-Malik, or \\"King\\". Ibn Ruzzik, a Twelver Shi'a, had further consolidated his position by forcing the young Al- øƒÄ·∏çid to marry his daughter.Bianquis, Thierry (2000). \\"·π¨alƒÅ æi ø b. Ruzzƒ´k\\". The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, Volume X: T‚ÄìU. Leiden: E. J. Brill. pp. 149‚Äì151. . Fatimid rule was so weak and divided by this time that the Crusaders were able to begin their invasions of Egypt. Al-Adid was the last Arab ruler in Egypt and Syria, and according to Michael Haag, \\"the once imperial Arabs were now governed by Turks and Kurds\\". Shawar, a former Fatimid governor of Upper Egypt, who, amid the empire's power struggle turned to Nur ad-Din Zangi, ruler of the Zengids in Syria, and was able to establish himself as vizier in Egypt (1163‚Äì1169), and he was the effective ruler of the land. Through careful seesaw diplomacy between Crusaders and Zengids, Shawar maintained a fragile grip on power. First, with the help of Syrian troops under Shirkuh and Saladin, Shawar's forces were able to fight off the Crusader incursions. A remarkable alliance was struck in 1167 between his caliphate and the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, against the Zengids. The crusader Arabic- speaking envoys, Hugh Grenier, a Knight Hospitaller, and Geoffrey Fulcher, a Knight Templar, arrived at his palace in Cairo, which was lavishly described by William of Tyre based on their impressions. Eventually, however, Shirkuh killed Shawar and took his place in 1169. After Shirkuh's death two months later, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin became vizier of Egypt. When al-Adid died of natural causes in 1171, the Fatimid dynasty ended to make way for the Ayyubids (1171‚Äì1260), a dynasty named for Saladin's father Ayyub. There were attempts to restore Fatimid rule in 1174/1175 with the help of Kanz ad-Dawla and Umara ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Yamani. A pretender claiming descent as Da'ud bin Sulayman bin Da'ud bin al- øƒÄ·∏çid also attempted to restore Fatimid rule in the 13th century in Egypt with both attempts being defeated by the Ayyubids. Al-Adid was believed by the Hafizi Ismailis to be the 25th Imam and was succeeded by his son Daud surnamed Al-Hamid-lil-lah as Imam. The Hafizi sect continued with Daud Al-Hamid-lil-lah as 26th Imam who died in 1207/1208, in prison under the Ayyubids appointing his son Sulayman Badruddin as the 27th Imam, who died in 1248 also in prison under the Ayyubids. Sulayman Badrudddin died without issue in prison under the Ayyubids and the Hafizi Ismaili Imamah bloodline died out. The Hafizi sect survived into the 13th and 14th centuries with adherents in Northern Egypt, Syria and Northern Yemen but had died out by the 15th century.

It is named after the historic county of Glamorgan in Wales. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese. History The origins of Glamorgan sausages are unknown. Research conducted at the Glamorgan Archives in Leckwith discovered that there is at least one traditional recipe which used meat. In a notebook dated between 1795 and 1813, John Perkins, of Ty-draw, Llantrithyd, included each of lean pork and fat in his recipe for Glamorgan sausage. The spicing was also different from modern versions, calling for the use of cloves, sage and ginger. The first published mention of them was by George Borrow in his book Wild Wales, written in the 1850s and published in the next decade. He described them as \\"not a whit inferior to those of Epping\\"; Epping sausages were skinless meat- based sausages. Borrow visited Y Gwter Fawr (now known as Brynamman); the Tregib Arms has been suggested as the location at which Borrow ate his sausages. Newspaper advertisements promoting the sale of Glamorgan sausages begin to appear from 1869 onwards, with the first advert placed by pork butcher Henry S. Hammond of 288 Bute Street, Cardiff, placed in the Western Mail on 15 December. Hammond continued to advertise over the next several years, and by 1873 was claiming that the demand necessitated making the sausages on an hourly basis, and referenced other makers of the sausages making theirs days in advance prior to sale. The advert makes it clear that the sausages were made from \\"choice dairy-fed pork\\". Glamorgan sausages are thought to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of cheese to be used. In 2005, a campaign began to register the Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This would have resulted in only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being labelled as such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously been extended to Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was not passed into law. Recipe In modern versions, Caerphilly cheese is used, which is a descendant of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture so that it does not fall apart during the cooking process. =Variations= Glamorgan sausages, served with a tomato chutney In various recipes, other substitutions and additions are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as an alternative to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese as an alternative ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage. Cooking techniques for the leeks vary, as some recipes call for them to be mixed in raw, while others suggest browning them first in a frying pan. If left raw, they can lend a crunchier texture to the sausage. Both the Hairy Bikers and Canteen opt for cooking the leeks first. A variety of herbs are used, with Canteen using sage as seen in the Perkins recipe, in addition to nutmeg. The Welsh Gas Board recipe simply called for \\"mixed herbs\\", while Felicity Cloake in The Guardian suggested the addition of thyme. For the frying, the gas board and chef Sophie Grigson suggested the use of lard, while the Bikers used vegetable oil. Both Cloake and The Daily Telegraph writer Nigel Godwin proposed frying Glamorgan sausages in butter.

Dezember 2018 Ressa studied molecular biology and theater as an undergraduate at Princeton University, where she graduated cum laude with a B.A. degree in English and certificates in theater and dance in 1986. She then was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to study political theater at the University of the Philippines Diliman.  Career  Ressa conducts an interview with former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III at the Music Room of the Malaca√±ang Palace, June 7, 2016 Ressa's first job was at government station PTV 4. She then co-founded independent production company Probe in 1987, and simultaneously served as CNN's bureau chief in Manila until 1995. She then ran CNN's Jakarta bureau from 1995 to 2005. As CNN's lead investigative reporter in Asia, she specialized in investigating terrorist networks. She became an author-in- residence at the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research (ICPVTR) of Nanyang Technological University's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. From 2004, Ressa headed the news division of ABS-CBN, while also writing for CNN and The Wall Street Journal. In September 2010, she wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal criticising the then president Beningno Aquino III handling of the bus hostage crisis. This piece was published two weeks before the president's official visit to the United States of America. Speculations were rife this among other reasons finally led to Ressa leaving the company in 2010, after deciding not to renew her contract. = Books = She is the author of two books concerning the rise of terrorism in Southeast Asia--Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al- Qaeda's Newest Center (2003) and From Bin Laden to Facebook: 10 Days of Abduction, 10 Years of Terrorism (2013). = Teaching = Ressa has also taught courses in politics and the press in Southeast Asia for Princeton University, and broadcast journalism for the University of the Philippines. = Rappler = She established the online news site Rappler in 2012 along with three other female founders and with a small team of 12 journalists and developers. It initially started as a Facebook page named MovePH in August 2011 and later evolved into a complete website on January 1, 2012. The site became one of the first multimedia news websites in the Philippines. The site has since been a major news portal in the Philippines, receiving numerous local and international awards. It currently is the fourth largest website in the country employing about 100 journalists. She serves as the Executive Editor and Chief Executive Officer of the news website. = Gaffe = In May 2020, Ressa apologised for mistakenly saying that ABS-CBN has 11 million workers instead of 11 thousand. =\\"Real Content Oversight Board\\"= On 25 September 2020, Ressa was named as one of the 25 members of the \\"Real Facebook Oversight Board\\", an independent monitoring group over Facebook.https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-real-oversight- board-n1240958 Legal issues Ressa first interviewed Rodrigo Duterte the 16th president of Philippines in the 1980s when he was a mayor of Davao. She again interviewed him in 2015 during his presidential election campaign where he confessed to killing three people when he was a mayor. Under her leadership, Rappler has been consistently critical of Duterte's policies, especially his policies on war on drugs with their stories demonstrating that the abuses were being carried out by the police with Duterte's approval. The website under her stewardship also wrote about the alleged pro-Duterte online \\"troll army\\" which according to their article, were pushing out fake news stories and manipulating the narrative around his presidency. In July 2017, in his State of Union speech, Duterte declared Rappler to be \\"fully owned\\" by the Americans and hence in violation of the constitution. He also said, \\"Not only is Rappler's news fake, it being Filipino is also fake.\\" Subsequently, in August 2017, the Philippine securities and exchange commission (SEC) initiated an investigation against Rappler and demanded to check its documents. In January 2018, it revoked Rappler's license to do business. The case went to the court of appeals, where it was remanded back to the SEC for having no basis. Duterte told a Rappler reporter in 2018: \\"If you are trying to throw garbage at us, then the least that we can do is explain ‚Äì how about you? Are you also clean?\\" The government under his leadership revoked the site's operating license. = Arrest and conviction = On January 22, 2018, Ressa appeared before the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), to comply with a subpoena over an online libel complaint under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, which the administration of Rodrigo Duterte has wielded to punish criticism of the President and his allies. The subpoena was issued on January 10 to Ressa, together with former Rappler reporter Reynaldo Santos, and businessman Benjamin Bitanga. The subpoena was filed in October 2017 by a Filipino‚ÄìChinese national, Wilfredo Keng, after Rappler published a story on Keng's alleged lending of his sports utility vehicle to now-deceased Chief Justice Renato Corona as a bribed form of favor. Though the article was written in 2012 before the act criminalizing cyberlibel was signed into law by Benigno Aquino III, the Department of Justice considered it republished after a typographical error was corrected in 2014. In 2019, prominent international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney joined the legal team (consisting of international and Filipino lawyers) defending Ressa. In November 2018, the Philippine government announced that it would charge Ressa and Rappler's parent company, Rappler Holdings Corporation, with tax evasion and failure to file tax returns. The charge concerns the investment in Rappler by the Omidyar Network in 2015. Ressa has denied wrongdoing, originally stating that the foreign money was \\"donated\\" to its managers, later stating the investments were in the form of securities. Rappler issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. The Philippines' Bureau of Internal Revenue, after a study of Ressa's explanation, ruled that Rappler's issuance of securities-generated capital gains was taxable. It concluded that Rappler evaded payment amounting to ‚Ç±133million in taxes. On February 13, 2019, Philippine judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa of the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch #46 issued the arrest warrant for \\"cyber libel\\" against Ressa for an article published on Rappler. The officials of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation fulfilled this warrant filed under the charge of cyber libel. The \\"cyber libel\\" law was passed after the article was originally published, so the charge was based on the technicality that fixing a typo might be considered \\"republishing\\". The arrest was live-streamed by many of Rappler's senior reporters on Facebook. Due to time constraints, Ressa was unable to post bail amounting to ‚Ç±60,000 ($1,150) resulting in her arrest and confinement within the (holding) board room office of the NBI building. A total of six lawyers, two pro bono, were assigned to work on her case. On February 14, 2019, at the executor proceeding of Manila city Judge Maria Teresa Abadilla, Ressa gained freedom by posting bail at ‚Ç±100,000 ($1,900). Ressa's arrest was criticized by the international community. As Ressa is an outspoken critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, many viewed the arrest as being politically motivated. In contrast, the official spokesperson for the Malaca√±ang Palace denied any government involvement in the arrest, asserting that the lawsuit against Ressa was set forth by a private individual, the plaintiff Wilfredo Keng. Madeleine Albright, a former U.S. Secretary of State, issued an opinion stating that the arrest \\"must be condemned by all democratic nations\\". Similarly, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines called it \\"a shameless act of persecution by a bully government\\". The National Press Club, an organization accused of having close ties to the Duterte regime and with a long history of criticising the Rappler organization, has stated that the arrest was not harassment, and that Ressa should not be relegated to \\"the altar of press freedom for martyrdom\\". It also warned against politicizing the issue. Ressa's trial on charges of cyberlibel began in July 2019. In a statement she made on the first day of her trial, Ressa said: \\"This case of cyberlibel stretches the rule of law until it breaks.\\" Ressa was found guilty on June 15, 2020. In her ruling, Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa argued that Rappler \\"did not offer a scintilla of proof that they verified the imputations of various crimes in the disputed article... They just simply published them as news in their online publication in reckless disregard of whether they are false or not.\\" Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa also quoted Nelson Mandela, saying, \\"To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\\" Sharon Coronel, director of the Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism at Columbia University, argued that the conviction is representative of \\"how democracy dies in the 21st century.\\" Ressa faces between six months and six years in prison and a fine of ‚Ç±400,000 ($8,000). Ressa warned that her conviction could augur the end of freedom of the press in the Philippines. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque asked the media to \\"respect the decision\\" and affirmed the commitment of President Rodrigo Duterte to free speech, while opposition leader Leni Robredo described it as a \\"chilling development\\" and the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said it \\"basically kills freedom of speech and of the press.\\" Internationally the ruling has been criticized by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders. In its statement condemning the release, Reporters Without Borders termed the legal proceedings against Ressa \\"Kafkaesque\\".

He commanded the two lieutenants and 62 legionnaires who fought the legendary Battle of Camar√≥n during the French intervention in Mexico, during which he was killed. Education Jean Danjou was born in Chalabre, he enrolled in the √âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, the foremost French military academy, and graduated from the academy at the age of 20.Ryan, James W., 1996, Camerone, The French Foreign Legion's Greatest Battle, Westport: Praeger Publishers, He was assigned to the 51st Regiment of the Line. Military career In 1852, he transferred to the 2nd Foreign Regiment. He was transferred to Algeria, to assist French colonization efforts, including the campaigns of Kabylie. He lost a hand during a mapping assignment, on 1 May 1853, when his musket exploded. He designed a wooden prosthetic hand, which he used for the rest of his life. Danjou was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 24 December 1853. As a 1st lieutenant, Danjou was part of the French army that fought in the Crimean War, and served during the Siege of Sevastopol. He was promoted to captain on 9 June 1855. His next campaign during the Austro-Sardinian War, where in 1859 he fought in the Battle of Magenta and the Battle of Solf√©rino. After serving in Morocco for some time, Danjou was part of the French expeditionary corps sent to Mexico in 1862. He was the quartermaster of Colonel Jeanningros, who was in charge of the Foreign Legion regiment in Mexico. It was the duty of the Legion to ensure the movement and safety of French supply convoys. On 29 April, Colonel Jeanningros was informed that an important convoy was on its way to Puebla with three million francs and material and munitions for the siege. Danjou decided to send a company to escort the convoy. The 3rd company of the Foreign Regiment was assigned to this mission, but had no officers available. Danjou himself took command. Two other officers volunteered for this mission: 2nd Lt. Jean Vilain, Regimental Financial Officer, and 2nd Lt. Cl√©ment Maudet, Regimental Colours-Bearer. The Battle of Camar√≥n At 1 a.m. on 30 April, the 3rd company was on its way, with three officers and 62 men. At 7 a.m., after a march, it stopped at Palo Verde to rest. Soon after, a Mexican force of 3,000 soldiers (800 cavalry and 2,200 infantry) was spotted. Danjou had the company take up a square formation and, even though retreating, he drove back several cavalry charges, inflicting the first heavy losses on the enemy. Looking for a more defensible position, Danjou decided to make a stand at the nearby Hacienda Camar√≥n, an inn protected by a 10-foot (3-meter) high wall. His plan was to tie up the enemy forces to prevent any attacks on the nearby convoy. While the legionnaires prepared a defense of the inn, the Mexican commander, Colonel Milan, demanded that Danjou and his men surrender, pointing out the fact that the Mexican Army was greatly superior in number. Danjou went around to each of his men with a bottle of wine and made them all take a solemn oath not to surrender. At noon, Danjou was shot in the chest and died. His soldiers continued to fight until 6 p.m. despite overwhelming odds and extreme heat. The 60 men, who had had nothing to eat or drink since the day before, resisted many charges of the Mexican army. The last five survivors were all down to their very last bullet. Instead of dishonoring themselves, they decided to charge with fixed bayonets. When they did, the Mexican commander ordered his troops to cease fire. Out of admiration for their courage, he spared the surviving men and allowed them to form an honour guard for the body of Captaine Danjou. They were released to return to France. This story has become legendary in French military history. Danjou was buried on 3 May 1863 in Camar√≥n. After the battle, a Mexican named Ramirez discovered and took Danjou's wooden hand. Ramirez was soon arrested and the hand retrieved by Lieutenant Karl Gr√ºbert of the Austrian army, which replaced the Foreign Legion in this conflict on 17 July 1865. Today, Danjou's wooden hand is paraded annually on April 30, Camerone Day. Prosthetic Hand Wooden hand of Jean Danjou When the Legion moved to France, Danjou's wooden hand was taken to Aubagne, where it remains in the Legion Museum of Memory. The hand is the most cherished artifact in Legion history, and the prestige and honor granted to a Legionnaire to carry it on parade in its protective case is among the greatest bestowed on a Legionnaire. 30 April is celebrated as \\"Camerone Day\\", an important day for the Legionnaires, when the wooden prosthetic hand of Capitaine Danjou is brought out for display. Captain Danjou appears in Ian Colquhoun's 2014 historical novel 'Le Boudin - The Demons of Camerone' - Colquhoun, like Danjou, is an amputee.

Her works range from autobiographical writing, travel writing and reflective novels, to translations of Spanish-language comic strips. She studied philosophy and taught German before becoming a career writer. Born as Chen Mao-ping (Èô≥ÊáãÂπ≥), her pen name was adopted from the main character of Zhang Leping's most famous work, Sanmao. In English, she was also known as Echo or Echo Chan, the first name she used in Latin script, after the eponymous Greek nymph. Later in life, she legally changed her name to Chen Ping; since young, she was said to have avoided writing the character \\"Mao\\" as she never mastered the ability to do so. Early life Sanmao was born in Chongqing to Chen Siqing, a lawyer, and Miao Jinlan. She had an older sister, Chen Tianxin. Her parents were devout Christians. Her family was from Zhejiang. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, the family moved to Nanjing. When she was six, her family moved to Taiwan because of the Communist takeover of mainland China. She disliked the lack of freedom in Taiwan's educational system, in which strict restrictions were placed on students. As a child, she developed an early interest in literature and was exposed to famous Chinese writers, such as Lu Xun, Ba Jin, Bing Xin, Lao She, and Yu Dafu. She read works such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Don Quixote, and Gone with the Wind. She was particularly interested in Dream of the Red Chamber and read it as a Grade 5 student during class. When asked what she wanted to become when she was older, she responded that she wanted to marry a great artist, specifically Pablo Picasso. Due to her preoccupation with reading, Sanmao's grades suffered in middle school, particularly in mathematics. After a distressing incident when a teacher drew black circles around her eyes and humiliated her in front of her classmates, Sanmao stopped attending school. Her father taught her English and classical literature at home and hired tutors to teach her piano and painting. In 1962, at age 19, Sanmao published her first essay. Career Sanmao studied philosophy at the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan, with the goal of \\"[finding] the solution to problems in life.\\" There, she dated a fellow student; however, becoming \\"disillusioned with romance,\\" she moved to Madrid, Spain at age 20 and began studying at the University of Madrid. It was in Madrid where Sanmao met marine engineer Jos√© Mar√≠a Quero y Ru√≠z, whom she would later marry. Sanmao later moved to Germany, where she intensively studied the German language, sometimes up to 16 hours per day. Within nine months, she earned a qualification to teach German and began studying ceramics. At age 26, Sanmao returned to Taiwan. She was engaged to a teacher from Germany, but he died from a heart attack before they could marry. Sanmao returned to Madrid and began teaching English at a primary school, rekindling her relationship with Ru√≠z. Desert in Western Sahara In 1976 she published the autobiographical The Stories of the Sahara, which was on her experiences living in the Sahara together with her Spanish husband Jose, who she first met in Madrid and later married in 1973 while living together in the then Spanish- controlled Western Sahara. Part travelog and part memoir, it was an account of life and love in the desert, and established Sanmao as an autobiographical writer with a unique voice and perspective. Following the book's immense success in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China, her early writings were collected into a book, published under the title Gone With the Rainy Season. She continued to write, and her experiences in the Sahara and the Canary Islands were published in several more books. On September 30, 1979, Jose drowned while diving. In 1980 she returned to Taiwan, and in November 1981, she traveled to Central and South America on commission from Taiwanese publishers. These experiences were recorded in subsequent writings. From 1981 to 1984, she taught and lectured at her alma mater, Chinese Culture University, in Taiwan. After this point, she decided to dedicate herself fully to writing. Sanmao's books deal mainly with her own experiences studying and living abroad. They were extremely well received not only in Taiwan, but also in China, and they remain popular reads today. From 1976 to the time of her death in 1991, Sanmao published more than 20 books. She also translated the comic Mafalda from Spanish to Chinese. In 2019, Sanmao was acknowledged in the New York Times Overlooked posthumous obituary feature for her book The Stories of the Sahara. Her work is lauded for its endurance through generations, inspiring young Taiwanese and Chinese women yearning for independence from conservative cultural norms.  Death  On January 4, 1991, at the age of 47, Sanmao died by suicide in a hospital in Taipei by hanging herself with a pair of silk stockings. Some fans, notably Zhang Jinran, claimed her death was a murder. Her apparent suicide came as a shock to many of her readers and was accompanied by public expressions of grief throughout the Chinese-speaking world. There has been much speculation regarding the reason for her suicide: a cancer scare, disappointment over losing the Taiwan movie Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards for her script to the film Red Dust, a loss which she took poorly, or depression over her husband Jose's death, which had occurred 12 years earlier.Tamara Treichel (March 11, 2013).

It is located on the island of Vigra in Giske Municipality and features a runway aligned 07/25. The airport served 1,077,209 passengers in 2013, making it the tenth-busiest airport in the country. Scheduled services are provided domestically to Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim by Scandinavian Airlines (SAS)¬∏ Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wider√∏e. International scheduled services are provided by KLM Cityhopper, Norwegian, SAS and Wizz Air. The first airport serving √Ölesund was √Ölesund Airport, S√∏rneset, a water aerodrome. Vigra narrowly beat Aukra Airport, Gossen as the main airport for M√∏re og Romsdal and subsequently opened on 7 June 1958. It originally featured a runway and all scheduled flights were provided by Braathens SAFE. Except for regional routes operated by Wider√∏e from 1971 to 1993, Braathens flew all routes out of Vigra until 1998. International flights commenced in 1977 and a new terminal opened in 1986. The National Air Ambulance Service has operated out of the airport since 1988. Between 1995 and 1998 the 330 Squadron had a detachment at Vigra for its Westland Sea King for search and rescue. Color Air and SAS started flying to √Ölesund in 1998. After suffering heavy losses, SAS bought Braathens and Color Air closed down. Norwegian Air Shuttle thereafter entered, first in 2004 and then in 2008. The terminal was expanded in 2007 and since the airport has seen a series of international destinations. History =Proposals= Plans for scheduled flights to √Ölesund were first articulated in 1919 by a government commission as part of a coastal seaplane route from Stavanger to Trondheim. The first landing in √Ölesund took place on 27 May 1920. Thereafter flights were sporadic.Hjelle: 12 The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service set up a base at Skutvika near the town center in November 1929, which they used to search for herring. They moved the base the following year, establishing √Ölesund Airport, S√∏rneset.Hafsten & Arheim: 63 Later used both for civilian flights, scheduled services and Luftwaffe operations,Hjelle: 13 the water aerodrome remained in use until 1979.Hjelle: 123 Work on a land airport around √Ölesund started with a public speech held by Hjalmar Riiser- Larsen in 1933. In the following excursion, he proposed Moa and Vigra as suitable locations. The former was preferred by the government, who included it in its 1935 plan for primary airports. The Luftwaffe also considered Moa as a suitable location, but instead opted to build Aukra Airport, Gossen.Flatmark: 118 However, that airport was not completed by the end of the Second World War in 1945. After the war ended M√∏re og Romsdal County Municipality established a commission to look into the location of a central airport for the county of M√∏re og Romsdal. They concluded that since Gossen was nearly completed and was more centrally located within the county, it would be a preferred location. In √Ölesund there was work with having Vigra chosen. They founded A/S Vigra Flyplass and in 1951 two students made calculations showing that Vigra would be cheaper than Gossen. The latter was selected by Parliament in 1952.Hjelle: 14 =Construction= The Civil Airport Administration (CAA) issued NOK 3.2 million for the upgrade of Gossen in 1955. However, Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap which was operating the seaplane route along the coast, launched a plan to operate Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer aircraft from a runway at Vigra. The CAA therefore placed Gossen's funding on hold. √Ölesund Municipality appointed a commission which demanded that the runway should be , allowing for operation of the de Havilland Heron. They negotiated the purchase of the necessary of land at Vigra and started construction on 9 January 1957. At this point Vigra was planned as a regional airport. Within a short period the CAA determined that the Twin Pioneer would not be approved and that, following Braathens SAFE Flight 253 that Heron's would not be allowed to fly during winter. The municipality therefore applied in February 1957 that Vigra be given status as a primary airport. Parliament approved this and granted funding for air traffic control and operations. Construction involved building a runway and to taxiway. These were built by Veibygg, Fredrikstad Granittkompani and Korsbrekke og Lorck. The terminal was building measured , of which was a garage, and was built by Bjarne Haugseth. √Ölesund Municipality was the owner and developer.Hjelle: 16 Three radio beacons were built.Hjelle: 17 √Ölesund was to be connected both to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and to a coastal service from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Bergen Airport, Flesland and √Ölesund to Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes. The latter had been operated by Vestlandske Luftfartselskap, but they went bankrupt in 1957. Both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the √Ölesund concession. Initially the ministry wanted to award the coastal service to Braathens and the Oslo route to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, allowing them to cross-subsidize the former. This was accepted by the ministry.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 112 =Early operation= Vigra with the airport The first aircraft to land was a military de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter, on 19 May 1958 with supplies for the navigational aids. Braathens landed a Heron on 2 June. The official opening took place on 7 June with 3,000 spectators.Hjelle: 18 Flights were at first flown using the Douglas DC-4.Hjelle: 90 Initially the coastal service and the Oslo service were flown one time per day.Hjelle: 89 Vigra did not originally have more to a terminal than a waiting hall. Check-in and baggage pick-up was handled at Braathens SAFE's offices at Skateflua in the city center. They were then transported by bus to the airport by Record og Vigra Rutelag (RVR).Hjelle: 191 They also operated a new car ferry services which was established between √Ölesund and Valder√∏y. M√∏re og Romsdal Fylkesb√•tar (MRF) took over the ferry service from 1965.Hjelle: 195 Ownership of the airport passed to the CAA and the state from September 1959. This coincided with a new taxiway from the runway and the opening of the instrument landing system (ILS).Hjelle: 19 This could only be used on runway 25. The Vigra Transmitter was situated in the way for the other direction. The ILS was installed without an inner marker.Hjelle: 37 The tarmac was extended in 1960 to make way for a general aviation section near the control tower.Hjelle: 20 Due to sinking of the runway it had to be re- asphalted the following year.Hjelle: 21 Braathens introduced their new Fokker F27 Friendship from 9 January 1959. From the summer program it flew two daily flights to Oslo and from 1961 twice per day on the coastal route.Hjelle: 91 VHF omnidirectional range and distance measuring equipment navigational system were installed in 1963. √Ölesund Airport experienced a massive increase in traffic during the 1960s. A third daily departure to Oslo was introduced in August 1963 and on the coastal route from 2 May 1964. The latter was extended to Bod√∏ Airport and Troms√∏ Airport from 1 April 1967, and upgraded to a fourth daily service. Some Oslo services were provided using a Douglas DC-6. A year later the coastal route increased to five daily trips, which was matched by the Oslo route in 1969.Hjelle: 93 That year also saws the installation of a visual approach slope indicatorHjelle: 38 and the introduction of the Fokker F28 Fellowship in March. MRF introduced a hovercraft service from √òrsta via Hareid to √Ölesund and Vigra, then onwards to Molde and √Öndalsnes. The 18-passenger craft sank only days after the service was inaugurated in April 1965. Two more hovercraft were delivered and served the route. Travel times was 50 minutes to Molde, 80 minutes to √Öndalsnes, 25 minutes to Hareid and 50 minutes to √òrsta. However, by the time of the fall storms the authorities withdrew the operating certificate due to safety concerns.Hjelle: 197 In the course of two years the number of airports in M√∏re og Romsdal increased from one to four, having a dramatical effect on patronage at Vigra.Hjelle: 94 Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget opened on 30 June 1970Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 183 after which two of the four daily Oslo services were moved there. √òrsta‚ÄìVolda Airport, Hovden opened on 1 July 1971, along with three airports in Sogn og Fjordane‚ÄîFlor√∏, F√∏rde and Sogndal. These were connected to Vigra with Wider√∏e's de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter services. Molde Airport, √Ör√∏ opened on 5 April 1972.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 184 Braathens introduced its Boeing 737-200 on one of the Oslo services that year. A new works building opened in 1972, including a new fire station, command center and workshop.Hjelle: 54 The Friendship was pulled out of Vigra from 1976, by which time Braathens was back up to fifteen daily services. The Fellowships had five departures in each direction on the coastal service and the 737s had taken over all the Oslo services. To handle the increased traffic the terminal was slightly expanded with a temporary structure, allowing the airport to handle two simultaneous aircraft.Hjelle: 23 =New terminal and longer runway= The first inclusive tour charter at Vigra was carried out by Stjernereiser in June 1977, contracting a Sud Aviation Caravelle from Transeuropa to Palma de Mallorca. The short runway meant that the aircraft could not take a full tank of fuel and therefore stopped in Stavanger to refuel. Vigra saw a limited amount of charter, largely since all flight had to have an intermediate landing.Hjelle: 104 M√∏refly, an √Ölesund-based air ambulance and helicopter operator, relocated its base from S√∏rneset to Vigra in 1979. This followed their building of a hangar and office building at the airport. Braathens extended its city offices in 1979 and the following year a new wing was added to the terminal for international arrivals. Baggage could from then be picked up either at the airport or in the city center.Hjelle: 24 Meanwhile, the traffic increased made it necessary for the airport to receive a new major upgrade. The works building was expanded in 1982, including more garages and office space.Hjelle: 55 A new control tower was taken into use in November 1984.Hjelle: 39 A new terminal was also built for NOK 53 million. It included an upper story with a restaurant. MRF operated a fast ferry service from Hareid to Vigra from 12 September 1983. The parking was expanded from 60 to 254 places, and from 1986 parking became paid. A private competitor, Vigra Parkering, offered parking from 1985 to 1991, after which the CAA bought the lot.Hjelle: 185 The new terminal also featured car rental from four companies.Hjelle: 187‚Äì189 Although the old terminal was proposed used as an offshore helicopter terminal, it caught fire in 1986 and was demolished the following year. M√∏refly introduced the first international scheduled service, to Aberdeen Airport in the United Kingdom, from 14 April 1986. In conjunction with this the airport introduced airport security for select passengers.Hjelle: 181 The Aberdeen route was terminated on 28 March 1987.Hjelle: 124 The National Air Ambulance Service was established on 1 January 1988. Vigra was selected as the base both for a Beechcraft Super King Air fixed-wing air ambulance and an A√©rospatiale SA365N Dauphin 2 rotorcraft. From 1 November 1988 to 31 January 1989 M√∏refly operated an A√©rospatiale SA332 Super Puma search and rescue helicopter from Vigra, before this was relocated. The Dauphin was relocated to √Ölesund Heliport, Hospital when it opened in 1993. M√∏refly merged with Lufttransport in 1995. The Vigra Fixed Link opened between 1987 and 1989. It consists of the long Ellings√∏y Tunnel between √Ölesund and Ellings√∏ya, the long Valder√∏y Tunnel connecting the islands of Ellings√∏ya and Valder√∏ya, and others. This allowed travelers from √Ölesund to reach the airport without a ferry. They remained a toll road until 25 October 2009. RVR and the airport coach service was taken over by √Ölesund Bilruter from 1 January 1988. A precision approach path indicator system was completed in 1991. Three years later an automatic terminal information service was taken into use.Hjelle: 41 The airport had for years been limited by its short runway. The construction of the tunnels spurred a surplus of earthwork, which could be used to reclaim land east of the tunnel and extend the runway along it. However, the extension of the runway proper did not take place until 1994, costing NOK 60 million.Hjelle: 25 The new runway was taken into use on 20 October 1995.Hjelle: 26 The most important part of this extension was that inclusive tour charters resumed from the airport, after several years without such services due to the need for a refueling stop. The airport therefore opened a duty-free store in 1996.Hjelle: 179 Braathens introduced its Boeing 737-500 at √Ölesund in 1990, replacing its older -200s by 1995.Hjelle: 98 Wider√∏e withdrew from √Ölesund in 1993, when the Twin Otters were retired.Hjelle: 103 The same year Braathens subcontracted some √Ölesund routes to their regional affiliate, Norwegian Air Shuttle, who operated the Fokker 50.Hjelle: 105 The Super Puma search and rescue service spurred public demands for a rescue helicopter to be based at Vigra. From 11 September 1995 the 330 Squadron of the Royal Norwegian Air Force stated a Westland Sea King helicopter at Vigra for such a service. However, the proximity to √òrland Main Air Station proved that the area was well covered from there. The service was therefore closed from 1 January 1999 and relocated to Rygge Air Station.Hjelle: 113 =Deregulation= The Norwegian airline market was deregulated from 1 April 1994. This initially had little effect on Vigra, as there were insufficient slots at Fornebu for new entrants to start flying to √Ölesund.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 340 Quite the contrary, the deregulation initially led Braathens to terminate the coastal services to Northern Norway, although it maintained flights to Bergen and Trondheim. From 19 April 1998 Braathens also served √Ölesund with its Boeing 737-700. A radar was installed at the airport in 1998. The same year all the electronics in the control tower were replaced. Boeing 737-400 of Scandinavian Airlines Fornebu was replaced by Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 8 October 1998, which had ample room for new routes. √Ölesund-based businessman Olav Nils Sunde saw the opportunity to establish a low-cost carrier, Color Air. It started twice-daily services from √Ölesund to Gardermoen on 6 August, using a Boeing 737-300.Hjelle: 149 SAS introduced flights from Oslo to √Ölesund on 7 December.Hjelle: 109 They initially used Douglas DC-9 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80, later switching to Boeing 737-600.Hjelle: 110 The number of Oslo-bound flights thus increased from seven to seventeen. The three operators started an intense price war which within a year had cost them NOK 3 billion. Color Air ceased operation on 27 September 1999. SAS also opened a route to Copenhagen Airport in Denmark via Bergen, which was soon terminated. SAS bought Braathens in May 2001, from 2002 the two SAS Group airlines coordinated their flights to √Ölesund. Their ground services were taken over by SAS Ground Handling.Hjelle: 115 Norwegian Air Shuttle shifted its operations in 2002 from a regional carrier to a low- cost airline. It took up competition with the SAS Group and launched an Oslo route on 23 August 2003 using the Boeing 737-300, using R√∏ros Flyservice as their ground handler. These were most ex-Braathens employees. Norwegian initially remained at √Ölesund only until 10 October 2004. Braathens and SAS merged in 2004 to create SAS Braathens, which served √Ölesund until 1 June 2007, when it again became part of Scandinavian Airlines.Hjelle: 114 Terminal exterior Full security check of all passengers took effect on 1 January 2004. An automated weather observing system was installed in 2006.Hjelle: 41 The same year √Ölesund Bilruter and the airport coach was taken over by Nettbuss. More tarmac for the general aviation section opened in 2006. In April the following year the main terminal was extended with . This included an arrival section for international passengers, with its own baggage carousel and a larger duty-free store. This allowed for simultaneous arrival of domestic and international passengers.Hjelle: 27 SAS Braathens commenced a bi-weekly service to London Gatwick Airport on 1 June 2007. It was terminated in 2008. Air Baltic introduced its Riga Airport service on 20 March 2008. SAS commenced a daily service to its hub at Copenhagen Airport from 31 March 2008. From 25 October 2009 this route was flown for SAS by Cimber Sterling using a Bombardier CRJ200 with two daily services. There was insufficient patronage for such a route and SAS resumed a daily service the following year. Norwegian returned to Vigra on 10 September 2008, when it reintroduced its Oslo service. They introduced bi-weekly services to Gatwick from 16 April 2011, as well as flights to √Ölesund to Trondheim and Bergen from the winter program of 2011. They also established weekly services to Alicante Airport and Gran Canaria Airport in Spain in 2012. The Trondheim route had insufficient patronage and were terminated from 1 February 2013. As a response, Krohn Air introduced a twice-daily service to Trondheim on 3 March 2013. It was terminated on 13 September. Wizz Air introduced thrice-weekly services to Gda≈Ñsk Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa Airport in Poland from March 2013. KLM Cityhopper commenced services to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport twice daily from 4 April, using the Fokker 70. It was followed up on 5 June with twice-weekly services by Wizz Air to Vilnius Airport in Lithuania. Norwegian terminated its Bergen route in January 2014. Wider√∏e responded by starting services to Bergen from the summer program of 2014. SAS responded by introducing more departures to Bergen and Trondheim and replacing some of them with smaller ATR 72 operated by Jet Time. Facilities The airport is situated on the island of Vigra on Giske, Norway. The main terminal has , including the control tower.

Its location was between Montclair Road and Crestwood Boulevard (U.S. Highway 78), adjacent to I-20, between Mountain Brook and Irondale. When it opened on August 25, 1960, Eastwood Mall was the second enclosed shopping mall in the Southeastern United States, being built after North Carolina's Charlottetown Mall, which opened on October 28, 1959. It remained one of the leading malls in Birmingham for nearly three decades and continued to hold its own into the 1990s.  History  Eastwood Mall was the creation of Newman H. Waters, who owned a chain of drive-in theaters in the Birmingham area, including one adjacent to where Eastwood was built. Eastwood Mall's original tenant list included J.J. Newberry and S.S. Kresge Corporation dime stores, as well as J.C. Penney, a Kroger supermarket, and Colonial Stores supermarket, (which became a Hill's Food Store, and eventually evolved into Winn-Dixie). The mall had no major department stores until the mid-to-late 1960s. Anchors that have been connected to the center over time include the local chains Parisian, Pizitz, and Yielding's, as well as Service Merchandise. A movie theater opened on Christmas Day 1964 and was equipped to show Cinerama movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ice Station Zebra. Eastwood Mall Theatre was also the site of the world premiere of the 1976 film Stay Hungry, which was set and filmed in Birmingham. In 1967, Newman Waters sold Eastwood Mall to Alabama Farm Bureau (today known as ALFA), which owned the property until the mid-1980s. A competing mall, Century Plaza, opened across the street in 1975. Decline In 1989, Eastwood Mall received a facelift, adding a food court with a glass atrium and a wall of video screens that made one big image, a Books-A-Million, and a larger space for Parisian. When larger cinemas came into favor, the Eastwood Mall Theatre was closed. However, the renovations came with a cost. Mismanagement involved with the mall renovations led to overcharged rents, which drove many of Eastwood's old- time tenants out, therefore turning the mall into a virtual dead mall. Walmart bought the property from Lehman Brothers (the last owner of Eastwood Mall), and demolition of the mall began on June 23, 2006. It was completed about 10 weeks later. A Walmart Supercenter opened on the site on October 22, 2007. This replaced the smaller Walmart in Irondale. It serves as one of the anchors of what is now called Eastwood Village. Other anchors are: Party City, Ross Dress For Less, Office Depot, and Shoe Carnival. Inside the \\"Retail Center\\" entrance of Walmart is a historical tribute to Eastwood Mall that contains a brief history of the mall, as well as several photos. The display was the work of Friends of Eastwood Mall in cooperation with Walmart. Many Eastwood Mall fans, as well as the Friends of Eastwood Mall, hope to see an official historical marker placed on the site of Eastwood Village honoring Eastwood Mall. As of November 2014, the western portion of the Eastwood Village shopping center has been sold. MAP Eastwood LLC sold the portion of the mall west of the Walmart, along with an out parcel to Eastwood Village Shopping Center LLC for $17 million, according to Jefferson County public records. The 134,000-square-foot purchase at 1600 Montclair Road did not include the Walmart or anything east of the retail chain. Phil Sambazis and Thomas Ladt of Sambazis Retail Group in Marcus & Millichap's San Diego office represented the seller. Andrew Chason of the firm's Mobile, Ala. office also provided representation. Zachary Taylor and Don McMinn, vice presidents investments in the firm's Atlanta office, represented the buyer. Sambazis said the mall is over 90 percent full and in good condition, and the buyer acquired the property as an investment. T-Mobile and Starbucks occupy the out parcel sold, and Ross Dress for Less, Office Depot, Party City, Tuesday Morning and Shoe Carnival are tenants in the main portion that was acquired.http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2014/11/13/eastwood- village-shopping-center-sold-for-17.html Grand opening ad from August 24th, 1960  See also  * Dead mall  References   External links  * Birmingham Public Library: Eastwood Mall * Deadmalls.com writeup on the mall with photos * Eastwood Mall history and photographs at BirminghamRewound.com *Grand opening ad from the Birmingham News via Newspapers.com Buildings and structures in Birmingham, Alabama Demolished shopping malls in the United States Defunct shopping malls in the United States Shopping malls established in 1960 Shopping malls disestablished in 2006 Shopping malls in the Birmingham, Alabama metro area 1960 establishments in Alabama ","title":"Eastwood Village"},{"id":"4341922","text":"Isora may refer to: * 1374 Isora, an asteroid * Artemis Isora, in Greek Mythology * Azumi-no-isora, a Japanese Deity * Helicteres isora, or Indian screw tree * Isora (beetle), a ladybird beetle genus See also * ","title":"Isora"},{"id":"4341942","text":"Controversy surrounds the UK‚ÄìUS extradition treaty of 2003, which was implemented by the UK in the Extradition Act 2003 and came into force in April 2007 following its ratification by the US Senate in 2006. Controversy The treaty has been claimed to be one-sided because it allows the US to demand extradition of UK citizens and other nationals for offences committed against US law, even though the alleged offence may have been committed in the UK by a person living and working in the UK (see for example the NatWest Three), and there being no reciprocal right; and issues about the level of proof required to extradite from the UK to the US versus from the US to the UK. Among other provisions Part 2 of the Act: Extradition to category 2 territories (non- European Arrest Warrant territories) removed the requirement on the US to provide prima facie evidence in extraditions from the UK, requiring instead only reasonable suspicion. This was necessary to redress the previous imbalance against the US under the 1870 Act, as the UK did not have to provide the more onerous prima facie evidence to extradite from the US. The requirement for the UK is to show probable cause. However, an independent legal review carried out by Sir Scott Baker found that \\"there is no significant difference between the probable cause test and the reasonable suspicion test. There is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States.\\" There is also concern at the loss of entitlement of UK citizens to legal aid for maintaining an adequate defence to criminal charges once they are extradited to US jurisdiction where costs are largely met by the defendant's private means. This has been a cause of controversy in cases where it has been perceived that the UK has suitable legislation for prosecuting offences domestically. The manner of its implementation also caused concern because of alleged secrecy and minimal parliamentary scrutiny. In response to these concerns, the Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Lord Justice Scott Baker to conduct an official review of the UK's extradition treaties, with the assistance of two independent extradition experts. The review was directed to address evidence standards and whether the US‚ÄìUK extradition treaty is unbalanced. Baker's report was presented to the Home Secretary on September 30, 2011, and concluded that there is no substantial difference in evidence standards, that the treaty is balanced and that there is not \\"any basis to conclude that extradition from the United Kingdom to the US operates unfairly or oppressively\\". The review contradicts the findings of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), which was intended to form part of the Government's full extradition review and which called for the Government to renegotiate the UK's extradition treaty with the United States to ensure British citizens get the same protection as Americans. The Home Affairs Select Committee published a report in 2012 into the UK‚ÄìUS extradition treaty and Extradition Act, acknowledging the low level of public confidence in the UK's extradition legislation. The Committee were particularly critical of the failure of the Home Office to publish the evidence that lies behind the Home Office-commissioned Scott Baker review ‚Äì the only parliamentary review to conclude that the US/UK Treaty was not imbalanced. The Committee had \\"serious misgivings\\" about some aspects of the US/UK arrangements but was at pains to recognise the importance of an effective extradition arrangement between the two countries. With respect to the differing legal standards of evidence required in support of an extradition request, the Committee accepted that there was \\"little or no distinction in practice between the 'probable cause' and 'reasonable suspicion' tests\\". The Committee further acknowledged that \\"extradition imposes a significant burden on the accused\\". On the most controversial of issues ‚Äì that of forum ‚Äì that campaigners have long been seeking to have introduced in UK legislation, the committee delivers perhaps its strongest message to parliament: \\"The Committee believes that it would be in the interests of justice for decisions about forum in cases where there is concurrent jurisdiction to be taken by a judge in open court, where the defendant will have the opportunity to put his case, rather than in private by prosecutors\\". The Committee concludes by recognising that it proposes significant amendments to the current legislation given the loss of public confidence in the current system. The Committee urges the government \\"to act with greater urgency\\" to rectify the issues the report has identified. Many say that the issue of forum is the key reform that will help bring an end to ongoing and future injustices that they say have occurred under the Extradition Act 2003. In April 2012 it was revealed in a Freedom of Information request to the UK Home Office that no US citizens have been extradited from the US to the UK under this treaty for crimes committed while the person was in the US. US ratification, 2006 The US‚ÄìUK Extradition Treaty 2003 was first sent to the US Senate for approval in April 2004. But another component of the controversy noted above was a result of the delay of the US in ratifying it into US law. Baroness Scotland, UK Minister of State for the Criminal Justice System at the Home Office, travelled to the US on Thursday 13 July 2006 to address this problem. This move was prompted by political criticism of the Extradition Act 2003 within the UK and an opposition proposal to amend the Act in the House of Lords. It also coincided with public disquiet at the case of the NatWest Three who were extradited on the same date. This meant the NatWest three were extradited to the US under the US‚ÄìUK Extradition Treaty 2003, even though that treaty had not been ratified in the US. On 30 September 2006 the US Senate unanimously ratified the treaty. Home Secretary John Reid said he was \\"delighted\\" that Baroness Scotland's visit to the US over the summer succeeded in getting Senate agreement, saying \\"The treaty is an important measure in our fight against serious international crime\\". Ratification had been slowed by complaints from some Irish-American groups that the treaty would create new legal jeopardy for Provisional IRA terrorists who fled to the US in the 1980s and their American supporters. US cases where the treaty has been applied From January 2004 to the end of December 2011, seven known US citizens were extradited from the US to the UK. No US citizen was extradited for an alleged crime while the person was based in the US. The US embassy in London reports that, as of April 2013, 38 individuals have been extradited from the US to the UK. UK cases where the Act has been applied From January 2004 to the end of December 2011, 33 known UK citizens (including 6 with dual nationality) were extradited from the UK to the US. The US embassy in London reported that as of April 2013, 77 individuals had been extradited from the UK to the US. The US argued that this is not disproportionate, due to the US population being about five times larger than the UK population. * Gary McKinnon ‚Äì extradition blocked on 16 October 2012 by order of Home Secretary Theresa May, on the grounds that \\"Mr McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights.\\" * NatWest Three ‚Äì extradited to Texas on fraud charges against a UK bank while they were living in the UK and working for the UK bank.

A spokesman for Tappin's lawyers said \\"This is a case in which the Customs agents caused the offence to be committed rather than merely providing an opportunity for the defendant to commit it.\\" On 9 January 2013, Tappin was given a 33-month prison sentence for arms dealing and fined US$11,357 (¬£7,095). * David McIntyre, an ex-soldier, was serving in Afghanistan when in July 2012 he was ordered to return to the UK after being accused of fraud following another man naming him in a plea bargain.

History While various iterations of what could be considered pensions existed before the declared independence of the United States, most were designed solely for veterans of wars or set up as charitable initiatives by Church communities. This trend continued throughout early American history, with much of the first veterans' pension under the newly formed United States offered to retired naval officers in 1799Clark, R. L., Craig, L. A., & Wilson, J. W. (1999). The Life and Times of a Public-Sector Pension Plan before Social Security: The US Navy Pension Plan in the Nineteenth Century. Life, 1, 1-1999.. Congress later created the Bureau of Pensions to oversee an increasing number of veterans' pensions in 1832 following the granting of pensions to all Revolutionary War veterans. Eventually, responsibility for these pensions would be transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1849 as returning veterans from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War put further stress on the systemDavies, W.

Payouts derived from this plan were based on degree of injury and subject to review by government boards. By 1890, general old-age pensions were incorporated for Union veteransibid. Outside of veterans' pensions, the institution of the first public pension plan for New York City Police is considered as the first iteration of a modern pension in the USA. The Police Life and Health Insurance Fund, created in 1857, provided payment to officers injured or otherwise disabled in the line of duty and offered compensation in a lump sum to families of officers killed in actionhttps://www1.nyc.gov/html/nycppf/html/about_ppf/ppf_history.shtml. The fund was initially funded not by state or municipal budgets, but by the sales of unclaimed stolen property, rewards, voluntary contributions and fines collected for violations of Sunday lawsibid, proving sufficient for the relatively low enrollment and demands of the initial plan. The compensation scheme later came to cover firefighters as well, growing into a lifetime pension plan about 20 years after its initial creation, with added funding from more substantial sourcesibid.

The United States saw significant growth in pension plans, both public and private, throughout the Progressive Era as labor sought more rights from larger, and often more industrialized employers. Private employer retirement plans also grew substantially following the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, which implicitly granted tax exempt status to retirement plans, making them more economically desirableFlexibility, W. (2010). A Timeline of the Evolution of Retirement in the United States.. Subsequent revenue acts in 1921 and 1926 added further, explicit benefits to contributions made to employees retirement plans (both defined contribution and benefit) spurring further growthibid. The establishment of the Social Security system and numerous New Deal initiatives aimed at providing a safe net for elderly Americans caused an explosion in the size of the nation's federal retirement investment. * See: Social Security Administration From the New Deal through the 1960s, numerous federal acts and regulations were created in order to encourage and protect the growing number of pensioners in the US. In particular, early retirement options were added to Social Security benefits and IRS regulations were created that clearly defined tax policies and benefits to pensionersibid. By the late 1960s, almost half of all employed persons in the United States had some form of pensionibid. However, the next seminal event in the history of pensions would be the creation of the Employees Retirement Income Security Act, ostensibly enacted in response to the failure of Studebaker and the loss of pension benefits promised to thousands of employeeshttps://www.pbgc.gov/about/who-we- are/pg/history-of-pbgc. Among other things, the act set fiduciary duties over pension plans, set funding requirements, and created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as a backstop to defined benefit plans. * ERISA * Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Further shifts in tax regulations, age of participation, vesting status, and contribution limits would be set throughout the Reagan, Clinton, and Bush administrations. Most notably, the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 and The Tax Reform Act of 1986 made significant changes to maternity leave implications for retirement savings' vesting schedules, specific compensation brackets, and attempted to unify rules for individual retirement accountsFlexibility, W. (2010). A Timeline of the Evolution of Retirement in the United States. Georgetown Press.. Both acts built upon changes made in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Despite reform legislation under discussion in the ensuing decades, pension participation particularly in the private sector continues to decline. From a peak of nearly 50% prior to the ERISA, now less than 10% of private sector employees are granted a defined benefit pension planWiatrowski, William J. (December 2012). \\"The last private industry pension plans: a visual essay\\" (PDF). Monthly Labor Review. Retrieved 2020-04-26. Types of Pensions in US A Defined Benefit Plan is commonly recognized as a \\"pension\\" in the United States. The structure of these plans guarantees a payout to a retiree following their date of retirement. This contrasts with a Defined Contribution Plan which creates a trust based on the amount invested by an employee during their working years. IRA, 401k plans, 403b, and 457 plans are prominent examples of the latter https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/457plan.asp and are not generally considered pensions in common parlance. Qualified v. Non- Qualified Plans Pensions can either be qualified or non-qualified under U.S. law. For defined benefit plans, the benefits of a qualified plan are protections under the Employees Retirement Income Security Act and offer tax incentives for contributions made by employers to fund the plansInternal Revenue Service. \\"A Guide to Common Qualified Plan Requirements.\\" Accessed April 26, 2020 . Non-Qualified plans are generally offered to employees at the higher echelons of companies as they do not qualify for income restrictions related to pensionshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-qualified- plan.asp. Typical iterations of these plans include executive bonus structures and life insurance contracts. Plans are also typically deferred compensation rather than defined benefitibid. Public, Private, and Union Distinctions There are also delineations drawn between public pensions, private company pensions, and multi-employer pensions governed under Taft-Hartley Act regulations. Multi-Employer Plans Multi-employer pensions necessitate a collective bargaining agreement between multiple employers and a labor union. The benefit of this structure is the mobility of labor between these employers without amending retirement and health benefits. A primary example of the benefit of these plans are the nations' Teamsters Unions whose employment demands necessitate movement across many geographies, maintaining benefits in each regionhttps://www.pbgc.gov/prac/multiemployer/introduction-to-multiemployer- plans. Multi-employer plans have courted a large degree of criticism in recent decades for corruption related to mob involvement and general misappropriation of pension fundsMarte, J. (2016). One of the nation‚Äôs largest pension funds could soon cut benefits for retirees. The Washington Post.. In response to growing concerns over funded ratios, the U.S. Congress enacting the Multi- employer Pension Protection Act of 1980 to increase funding requirements and curb bankruptcy fearshttps://www.pbgc.gov/prac/multiemployer/introduction-to- multiemployer-plans. Nonetheless, Congress was compelled to establish further regulations and restrictions on the specific stripe of plan in 2014 with the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA)ibid. Given the billions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities, the bill proposed reductions of pension benefits to plans slated to become insolventibid. The act also enforced penalty premiums on plans that necessitate PBGC intervention. Pension-Related Tax Law Various federal tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code apply to pension plans. Similar rules apply to profit-sharing plans and stock bonus plans, which are commonly used for retirement savings. Significant portions of these tax law provisions parallel portions of ERISA (see discussion in a preceding section of this article). Pension-Related Bankruptcy Law In April 2012, the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement Fund filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The retirement fund is a defined benefit type pension plan and was only partially funded by the government, with only $268.4 million in assets and $911 million in liabilities. The plan experienced low investment returns and a benefit structure that had been increased without raises in funding. According to \\"Pensions and Investments\\", this is \\"apparently the first\\" US public pension plan to declare bankruptcy.
