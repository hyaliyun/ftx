Biography Kambartel studied mathematics, physics, chemistry and philosophy at the University of Münster, where he received his PhD (in mathematics) and his “habilitation”, the postdoctoral lecture qualification (in philosophy). In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Constance, where he took active part in the reformation of the university (“Little Harvard on Lake Constance”). Kambartel has close ties to the Erlangen School of constructivist philosophy of science. He taught at Frankfurt am Main from 1993 until his retirement in 2000. Currently Kambartel is working together with his daughter on a conceptual novel. Kambartel’s main research areas are the philosophy of language, the philosophy of the natural sciences, and the philosophy of mind. However, he also did work in logic, action theory, ethics and the philosophy of economics. His most important works are the habilitation thesis “Erfahrung und Struktur” (“Experience and Structure”), published by Suhrkamp in 1968, as well as the two anthologies “Theorie und Begründung” (1978, “Theory and Justification”) and “Philosophie der humanen Welt” (1989, “Philosophy of the Human World”), also published by Suhrkamp. Two major topics are present throughout Kambartel’s work — on the one hand the primacy of practical reason, and on the other the conception of reason as culture. The first topic shapes his work in the philosophies of science, mind, and action. If practical reason were granted primacy over theoretical reason, if the latter were only possible on the basis of the former, then results obtained by neuroscience, for example, could never show that man is determined after all and cannot really act freely. The second topic does not emerge clearly until his later work, and then it also marks a distance to the constructive attempts of the Erlangen School. Reason was not to be understood exactly, e.g. to be defined as a principle or criterion. Reason was rather a culture you grow into, a social practice within which you cultivate your judgment. Conceptual judgments like Kant’s formula of man as an end in itself served as comments to parts of the “grammar” of this culture. Contrary to what Kant believed, morality was not supreme; it was only one standard of rationality among others; reason integrated this standard and weighed it up against other standards of rationality.

The prototype crashed during spinning trials at Woodley Aerodrome in January 1937. Four production aircraft followed. The design was modified to meet an Air Ministry specification and produced as the M.16 Mentor.Jackson 1988, p.341. In 1944 a Nighthawk fuselage was fitted with the wings from a Mohawk and fitted with a de Havilland Gipsy Six Series II engine with a variable pitch airscrew. It was designated the M.7A Nighthawk. The last Nighthawk to remain airworthy was G-AGWT in the early 1960s. This aircraft was raced in many postwar UK air competitions, but is no longer extant.

His name has many variations, including \\"Gerardus de Zutphania\\", \\"Gerardus Zutphaniensis\\", \\"Zerbold van Zutphen\\", \\"Gerhard Zerbolt von Zutfen\\", \\"Gerardus Zerboltus\\", etc. Biography Zerbolt was born in 1367 into a wealthy burgher family in Zutphen, then in the Duchy of Guelders. He got his first education in his hometown, and after attending one or more Latin schools elsewhere, he enrolled between 1383 and 1385 at the Brothers of the Common Life's St. Lebwin school in nearby Deventer.G. H. Gerrits \\"Inter Timorem Et Spem: A Study of the Theological Thought of Gerard Zerbolt\\", BRILL publisher, 1986. This school had been founded by Gerhard Groote (1340–1384) and in Zerbolt's time was led by Florentius Radewyns (1350–1400). Even in the Brothers of the Common Life's community of \\"plain living and high thinking\\" Gerard was remarkable for his absorption in the sacred sciences and his utter oblivion of all matters of merely earthly interest. He held the office of librarian, and his deep learning in moral theology and canon law did the brothers good service, in helping them to meet the prejudice and opposition which their manner of life at first aroused. In Radewijns' absence, Zerbolt assumed his responsibilities as rector. In June 1398, the plague drove most of the Brethren, including Zerbolt, from Deventer. They found refuge in Amersfoort until November. Here the legality of the Brotherhood was attacked regularly by the local clergy. Soon after his return to Deventer, Zerbolt traveled to the Benedictine monastery at Dikninge in Drente to confer with its learned abbot Arnold about the attacks. On his way home on December 3, Zerbolt and his companion stopped for the night at Windesheim, a small village just south of Zwolle. He felt mortally ill and died within a few hours, at the age of 31. Because of his heralded status, the Windesheim canons buried him quickly in an honored spot in their own chapel, before the Brethren from Deventer could collect the body. Writings Zerbolt was a prolific writer. His best known works are entitled Homo quidam and Beatus vir; the two are almost identical.Marguerin de la Bigne, Bibliotheca Patrum, XXVI Two treatises on prayer in the mother-tongue and on reading the Scripture in the mother-tongue are attributed to him.Karl Ullmann, Reformatoren vor der Reformation; and K.

Located in front of the Plaza de Armas and the Cathedral, the City Hall houses the executive power of Chihuahua, the office of the mayor of Chihuahua, and the City Council whose salon is of special interest. The edifice is considered one of the main landmarks in the city centre.  History  The building traces its origins to the construction of the so-called Royal House, built in 1721, that was designed to house the local authorities under royal Spanish rule. The building was popularly known as the Portals of the Municipality (Portales del Ayuntamiento). Eventually the colonial building was razed, and at the beginning of the 20th century construction was initiated on a new city office building. The project was put under the charge of Architects John White and Alfredo Giles, and the building was officially inaugurated by Chihuahuas governor, Don Enrique Creel on October 4, 1907. Since then the building has housed the municipal offices of the city, and in 2005 it underwent a further reconstruction, the most visible change being the color of the decorations near the roof which were changed from green to light brown.  Architecture  The building is a perfect example of the Mexican architecture that was erected during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz: Neoclassicism was influenced by French 'Beaux Artes' and European fashion at the turn of century. The building has two floors, the first with an available space for expositions and receptions. Of interest is the salon of the City Council which is decorated in a grand, almost Olympian style with large mirrors and Corinthian columns, and containing three stained-glass windows, representing the history and economy of the municipality, and including the City Coat of Arms. Also of interest is the honorary seat for the permanent member of the council, President Benito Juárez, who lived here with his cabinet and government-in-exile during the French incursion, from 1864 through December, 1866, and was accorded this honour during his stay.

It provided an important connection between Garifa railway station and Hooghly Ghat railway station. The Jubilee Bridge was opened on 16 February 1885 in the fiftieth, or jubilee, year of the reign of Queen Victoria. Construction began in 1882 and was completed in 1887. The Chief Engineer in charge of construction works was Lt Col Arthur John Barry, nephew of Sir John Wolfe-Barry, project engineer of the London Tower Bridge.Frederick Arthur Crisp Visitation of England and Wales, Volume 14, London (1906) The Bridge was designed by Sir Bradford Leslie, Chief Engineer in India and Alexander Meadows Rendel. Its steel was manufactured by Hawks Crawshay of Gateshead in England and James Goodwin of Motherwell in Scotland. Bradford Leslie also designed the floating pontoon bridge across the Hooghly in Calcutta, which was replaced by the Howrah Bridge in 1942 and the Gorai River Railway Bridge near Kushtia in Bangladesh. He was a son of the American painter Charles Robert Leslie, ultimately Professor of Painting at the Royal Academy in London. The Jubilee Bridge is noteworthy in that it is a cantilever truss bridge, constructed entirely by riveting, without any nuts or bolts used in the construction.  Replacement and retirement  The Jubilee Bridge was decommissioned from service on 17 April 2016, the last train to pass through it being 13141/Teesta Torsha Express. At the same time rail traffic was diverted through Sampreeti Bridge, the new bridge between Bandel and Naihati section of the Eastern Railway, that has been constructed beside the Jubilee Bridge. Jubilee bridge served the people for 129 years, and several generations used the service to cross the River Hooghly. The bridge has the distinction of being first permanent crossing over the Hooghly, which had been considered unbridgeable owing to difficult foundation conditions at that time. The new bridge, Sampreeti Bridge, was inaugurated in 2016 after work started on around 2004. It is the first continuous truss bridge in India.

During his time at Straight Left Milne became friends with Andrew Murray, who much later again became a colleague of Milne in the Labour Party. Milne himself was not a Communist Party member. Career =Journalism= Milne worked as a staff journalist at The Economist magazine from 1981, but was not content working for a free-market newspaper, later describing it as \\"the Pravda of the neoliberal ascendancy\\". He then joined The Guardian newspaper in 1984 on the recommendation of Andrew Knight, The Economists then editor. Milne's early responsibilities for The Guardian included posts as news reporter, Labour Correspondent (by 1994), and Labour Editor. In 1994, Milne's colleague Richard Gott resigned from The Guardian following an article in The Spectator that alleged Gott had connections to the KGB and was a Soviet agent of influence—charges that Gott vociferously denied. Milne defended Gott against these allegations, which he thought \\"seemed absurd\\", and claimed the journalists who had written the expose of his friend were connected to MI5.The \\"seemed absurd\\" quote appears in Milne was Comment Editor for six years from 2001 to 2007. According to Peter Wilby in an April 2016 New Statesman profile of Milne, his most controversial decision among Guardian staff was to print a 2004 article by Osama bin Laden, assembled from recordings of one of his speeches. While almost all thought it should have been published, a small majority thought it should not have been run as a comment piece, although the Readers' Editor later defended this decision. Milne's period in this role was described by Naomi Klein in her book The Shock Doctrine as having turned the Guardians comment section into a \\"truly global debating forum\\". Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan asserted that Milne's greatest achievement \\"was to take full advantage of the expansion of The Guardians comment pages ... making them the most thought-provoking opinion section in Britain\\". Hannan also praised him as \\"a sincere, eloquent and uncomplicated Marxist\\". Following changes in staff responsibilities, he was succeeded as comment editor by Georgina Henry, with Toby Manhire as her deputy. Milne was moved to his role as associate editor in 2007, according to Peter Wilby because he was building up too many writers in his own image, and devoting too much space to Palestine. Milne has reported for The Guardian from the Middle East, Latin America, Russia, Eastern Europe and South Asia,Guardian profile and has also written for Le Monde Diplomatique and the London Review of Books. He is reported to have lobbied within The Guardian in 2015 for editor-in-chief Katharine Viner to succeed Alan Rusbridger in the post. Milne served on the executive committee of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) for ten years, and is a former chairman of the joint Guardian-Observer NUJ chapter. In the 1980s, he chaired the Hammersmith Constituency Labour Party when Clive Soley (now Lord Soley) was the constituency's MP. \\"Resistance and the unity of the working class is what will progress our movement\\", Milne told a 2015 May Day rally in Glasgow. Kate Godfrey, who has worked as an aid worker in conflict zones such as Libya and Syria, described Milne as \\"an apologist for terror\\" in The Daily Telegraph in October 2015, adding that: \\"I think that he never met a truth he didn’t dismiss as an orthodoxy and that nowhere in his far-Left polemic are actual people represented\\". The attacks on Milne struck James Kirkup in the same publication nearly a year later as being \\"a little silly, since part of the point of this columnising lark is to say things that get attention and provoke argument: by that measure, he was pretty good at the job\\". =Labour's Director of Communications= In August 2015, Milne endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He wrote in The Guardian: \\"...the claim that the other leadership candidates – steeped as they are in the triangulating \\"pro-business\\" politics of the 1990s – can offer a winning electoral alternative to Corbyn's commitment to what are in fact mostly mainstream public views, looks increasingly implausible... But for now the Corbyn movement offers the chance of a break with a disastrous austerity regime – and for a real democratic opening.\\" Appointment On 20 October 2015, it was announced that Milne had been appointed to the team around Jeremy Corbyn, elected party leader the previous month, as the Labour Party's Executive Director of Strategy and Communications. Reportedly on a one-year contract, he was originally \\"on leave\\" from his post at The Guardian and assumed his new role on 26 October. \\"Just what the doctor ordered\\", Milne's friend George Galloway tweeted in response to the news.Galloway has said that Milne is his \\"closest friend. We have spoken almost daily for 30 years\\". See In a soon-deleted tweet, Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore expressed her dislike of \\"public school leftists\\" in reference to the news of Milne's new role and speculated that his appointment meant \\"Bye bye Labour\\". According to Tom Harris, a former Scottish Labour MP writing for The Daily Telegraph, Corbyn could have chosen for the Comms post \\"someone whose skills in media management were better known than his personal political views. Instead he chose Seumas Milne, a hate figure for the right of the Labour Party and pretty much everyone else to the right of that.\\" Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson told the BBC that Corbyn had shown a lack of professionalism in appointing Milne, \\"whom I happen to know and like as it happens. But he's completely unsuited to such a job, he has little connection with mainstream politics or mainstream media in this country.\\" John Jewell, an academic at Cardiff School of Journalism, criticised the articles by Harris and others which mention Milne's response to the murder of Lee Rigby. Jewell observes that \\"the article in which Milne wrote of Rigby not being a victim of terrorism 'in the normal sense' began with these words: 'The videoed butchery of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside Woolwich barracks last May was a horrific act and his killers' murder conviction a foregone conclusion.'\\" See also Patrick Wintour, the political editor of The Guardian, wrote that Corbyn \\"has been struggling to ensure he receives an effective press since he became party leader, and Milne will be charged with ensuring there is an improvement\\". In July 2016, Peter Preston, Milne's first Guardian editor, commented about the ethical challenges faced by journalists-turned-political advisers shortly after Milne's appointment: \\"The 'on leave' tag appears to make Seumas a once and continuing Guardian man, which won't help relations with journalists from elsewhere\\". Milne has demonstrated a low opinion of much of the British press in his comments. Milne left The Guardians staff in January 2017, when it became known he was working permanently for Corbyn. Owen Jones in his Guardian column defended Milne as \\"a deeply insightful and thoroughly decent man who has been wronged by his media portrayal as a soulless Stalinist apparatchik\\". January 2016 shadow cabinet reshuffle In early October 2015, a few weeks before his appointment was announced, Milne was interviewed by the Russian government-funded RT television network while the Labour Party conference was in progress. He said that Corbyn's initial front bench constituted a \\"stabilisation shadow cabinet\\" and was of the opinion that current Labour MPs were \\"not only far to the right of most Labour party members, but actually it's to the right of public opinion.\\" Milne commented that reselection in this parliament, necessitated by a reduction in the number of members of parliament due to planned constituency boundary changes, could be used for a \\"recalibration\\" of the parliamentary party.Milne expressed similar opinions earlier. See In response to Milne's comments on RT, Corbyn's spokesman said in October 2015 that the Labour leader \\"has been crystal clear he does not support changes to Labour's rules to make it easier to deselect sitting Labour MPs\\". The then Labour MP Ian Austin said, while the January 2016 reshuffle of Labour's frontbench was in progress, that Milne's actions had been \\"an absolute disgrace\\" over the previous few weeks. According to Austin, \\"people in the leader's office, I'm told by journalists, Seumas Milne, telling us that Hilary Benn was going to be sacked, that Michael Dugher was going to be sacked, a whole long list of people, not for questions of competence or loyalty but because they voted a different way on a free vote.\\" However, Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of The Spectator, cast doubt on this interpretation when speaking on This Week, giving credence to a view that it was other people who claim to be close to Corbyn who were briefing journalists. While Dugher was sacked by Corbyn from his post as Shadow Culture Secretary, Benn survived as Shadow Foreign Secretary. Milne made an official complaint to the BBC about the 6 January on-air announcement on the Daily Politics programme by Stephen Doughty that he had resigned as a shadow Foreign Office minister. In a letter to Robbie Gibb, the BBC's head of live political programmes, Milne objected to the BBC following a \\"particular political narrative\\". Gibb responded that the programme had merely observed the convention of the BBC, and other media outlets, in breaking news stories. Milne was reported, by Andrew Grice of The Independent on 21 January 2016, to be aligned with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell in a power struggle between two factions in Corbyn's team. June 2016 Vice News documentary A fly- on-the-wall documentary about the Corbyn-led Labour Party, produced by Vice News, became available online at the beginning of June 2016. Milne was featured asserting that Corbyn's line of attack as Leader of the Opposition for Prime Minister's Questions was leaked to the Conservative government. In a recorded aside Milne said that it happened \\"a third of the time\\", giving then prime minister David Cameron \\"an advantage\\". Labour's General Secretary Iain McNicol emailed party staff to acknowledge that they might be \\"upset\\" by Milne's comments and to reassure them that their work was appreciated. Brexit campaign and the Labour leadership crisis After the unexpected victory of the \\"Leave\\" campaign in the June 2016 referendum on UK membership in the European Union, Milne's role as Labour strategist came under scrutiny within the party. Internal emails passed to BBC News were alleged by Labour \\"Remainers\\" to show Milne minimizing party leader Corbyn's role in the Remain campaign. After more than sixty front-bench resignations, and a vote of no confidence with 80% of Labour MPs supporting the motion against Corbyn, Milne was accused by the Labour Party's former strategist John McTernan in the London Evening Standard of talking Corbyn out of resigning. Other sources, according to Robert Peston, have disputed this claim. Later developments According to Peter Wilby, writing in the New Statesman in March 2018, Milne as Corbyn's spin doctor \\"has proved rather good at it. Most lobby journalists, initially hostile, now respect and even like him, finding his calm, courteous and expletive-free manner a refreshing change from many of his recent counterparts\\". Wilby writes that Milne is the closest of the leader's team to Corbyn, after John McDonnell. Milne was replaced in April 2020, after the resignation of Corbyn and the election of Keir Starmer as leader of the Labour party. Views =Communism= Milne has attacked what he calls \\"the creeping historical revisionism that tries to equate Nazism and communism\\". The victims of Nazism \\"in the distorted prism of the new history...are somehow lost from the equation. At the same time, the number of victims of Stalin's terror has been progressively inflated over recent years\\", he wrote in 2002 which, he argues, has tended to \\"relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure\\". He has written that communism's \\"crimes are now so well rehearsed that they are in danger of obliterating any understanding of its achievements, both of which have lessons for the future of progressive politics and the search for a social alternative to globalised capitalism\\". Milne argued in 2006: In the same 2006 article, Milne criticised the Council of Europe and others for adopting \\"as fact the wildest estimates of those 'killed by communist regimes'\\". He has argued that while the \\"number of victims of Stalin's terror\\" remains \\"a focus of huge academic controversy\\", \\"the real records of repression now available from the Soviet archives are horrific enough (799,455 people were recorded as executed between 1921 and 1953 and the labour camp population reached 2.5 million at its peak) without engaging in an ideologically-fuelled inflation game\\". Milne contributed a foreword to Stasi State or Socialist Paradise (2015), a book by John Green and Bruni de la Motte about East Germany. In the Germany of Angela Merkel, he wrote, the denunciation of the former state has become a \\"loyalty test for modern Germans\\". The former communist state, he asserted, delivered \\"social and women's equality well ahead of its times, and greater freedom in the workplace than most employees enjoy in today's Germany\\". Milne told George Galloway in 2009 on the latter's The Mother of All Talk Shows (at that time broadcast on talkSPORT): =War on terror, Iraq wars and the response= Afghanistan and Iraq wars Milne has been a vocal critic of the \\"war on terror\\" and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He argued in 2001 that war in Afghanistan would fail to \\"stamp out anti-western terrorism\\" and if the US invaded Iraq, \\"it risks a catastrophe\\". In relation to Iraq, Milne argued in March 2008: According to Milne in July 2004, \\"the anti-occupation guerrillas\\" were \\"a classic resistance movement with widespread support waging an increasingly successful guerrilla war against the occupying armies\\". He argued in October 2009 for a \\"negotiated withdrawal\\" from Afghanistan based on a \\"political settlement, including the Taliban and regional powers\\". In a speech at a Stop the War rally on 4 October 2014, the day after Alan Henning is thought to have been beheaded, Milne said that \\"the horrific killing of the hostage Alan Henning in revenge for the British decision to bomb Iraq is a reminder, if any were needed, that another war in Iraq or Syria won't stop terror\\". He also said that \\"The group that calls itself Islamic State is the ultimate blowback from the invasion of Iraq\\", calling it \\"the Frankenstein product of the War on Terror\\". Motivations of al-Qaeda Milne argued after the London bombings that it was \\"an insult to the dead\\" and a \\"piece of disinformation long peddled by champions of the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan\\" to claim that al-Qaeda and its followers were motivated by \\"a hatred of western freedoms and way of life\\" and \\"that their Islamist ideology aims at global domination\\", rather than \\"the withdrawal of US and other western forces from the Arab and Muslim world\\" and an end to support for Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and despotic regimes in the region. Victor J. Seidler, a Professor of Social Theory from the University of London, argued in relation to Milne's article that we have to be careful \\"not to dismiss an Islamist rejection of the freedoms of Western urban cultures, in relation to consumerism and sexualities\\". Seidler argued that, contrary to Milne's claims, they were at least partly motivated by \\"Islamist religious doctrine\\".Seidler Urban Fears and Global Terrors, 2007. p. 118 Andrew Anthony, writing about the columnist's articles on Muslim extremism, asserted that \\"whereas Milne can instantly detect the relationship between far right rhetoric and the recent murder of Ahmed Hassan, a Muslim teenager in Dewsbury, he dismisses the idea that such hatred as was captured in the Dispatches programme \\"Undercover Mosque\\" [in 2007] might contribute to the kind of mentality that resulted in the carnage of the July 2005 bombs and the many terror plots that the authorities have successfully prevented.\\". Anthony was mainly responding to See Milne's comments about \\"Undercover Mosque\\" in Gaza Wars In the aftermath of the Gaza War (27 December 2008 – 18 January 2009), also known as Operation Cast Lead, Milne cited allegations of Israeli war crimes in arguing thus: \\"With such powerful evidence of violations of the rules of war now emerging from the rubble of Gaza, the test must be this: is the developing system of international accountability for war crimes only going to apply to the west's enemies – or can the western powers and their closest allies also be brought to book?\\" In a speech on 9 August 2014 at a Palestine Solidarity Campaign demonstration against the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflictThe Fourteen Films video recording of Milne's speech, delivered on 9 August 2014, is on their YouTube feed here. he said that \\"Israel has no right to defend itself from territories it illegally occupies. It only has an obligation to withdraw\\". He went on to say that \\"the Palestinians are an occupied people. They have the right to resist. They have the right to defend themselves from the occupier. It's not terrorism to fight back. The terrorism is the killing of citizens by Israel on an industrial scale that we have seen in the last month\\". =On Putin and Russia= Along with the journalist John Pilger and Andrew Murray, by now involved in Stop the War, Milne has been accused by Michael Mosbacher, writing for Standpoint magazine, of being one of the \\"leftist apologists\\" for Vladimir Putin's government in Russia. In The Times, Ben Judah wrote, \\"Illegal wars in Georgia, Syria and Ukraine. Thousands dead from bombing and artillery from Donetsk to Aleppo. An opposition strangled by a junta-like secret service with the same tools Seumas hated so much in Latin America. But this never comes up in his writing.\\" Nick Cohen wrote in September 2016 that people such as Milne, in allying themselves with Putin, \\"are not just making the West's enemy their friend. Western leftists are allying with the West's own far right\\" because Putin's government \\"funds the French National Front and far right nationalist movements in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria\\". In 2014, Milne attended the Valdai Discussion Club conference in Sochi, where he conducted a discussion in 2014 with Putin and former French prime minister Dominique de Villepin, opening a session there entitled \\"New Rules or No Rules in the Global Order\\". His expenses were paid for by the organisers of the event. On the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Milne wrote that \\"western aggression and lawless killing is on another scale entirely from anything Russia appears to have contemplated, let alone carried out – removing any credible basis for the US and its allies to rail against Russian transgressions\\", and has described the annexation as \\"clearly defensive\\", asserting that \\"the crisis in Ukraine is a product of the disastrous Versailles-style break-up of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s\\". Oliver Bullough, a journalist who formerly lived in Russia, disagreed with this view, asserting that \\"the destruction of the USSR was not some Versailles-style treaty imposed from outside. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus did it themselves\\". Cross-checking with the leak of 4,000 Russian emails, believed to originate from Putin's senior adviser Vladislav Surkov, the Conservative MP Bob Seely, and the Ukrainian specialist Alya Shandra, have found that several of Milne's articles on the Ukrainian crisis in 2014–15 appear to parallel the Kremlin's agenda at the time. Bullough also questions Milne's view of Russia in general, explaining he had himself lived in Russia for half a dozen years, and visited almost all the former Soviet bloc, \\"when I read what Milne writes about it, I slip into a parallel universe\\". Brian Whitaker, former Middle East editor for The Guardian, asserted in October 2015 that Milne In October 2016, while he was Jeremy Corbyn's press spokesman, Milne said that \\"The focus on Russian atrocities or Syrian army atrocities – which is absolutely correct – sometimes diverts attention from other atrocities\\"; that is, ones committed by the United States, Britain and their allies. Private life Milne married Cristina Montanari, an Italian-born director of an advertising firm, in 1992. The couple have two now-adult children, a son and daughter, who were educated at selective grammar schools in Kingston upon Thames. In or about 2013, Milne had a lung tumour removed.

Escondido High received a California Distinguished School award in 2007. History The first building to house Escondido High School was located in downtown Escondido. The University of Southern California (USC) constructed it in 1889 for use as a Methodist seminary. The seminary operated for ten years but eventually closed due to lack of finances. USC donated the building to a man named Henry Putnam, who himself gave it to the Escondido Union High School District. Overcrowding prompted the construction of a three-story building just south of the original site; this new building opened in 1927. The original building burned down in 1929. The severe damage to many school buildings in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake prompted the California State Legislature to pass the Field Act, mandating that school buildings be earthquake-resistant. The state inspected EHS and found the campus to be unsafe, but the inspection report was never acted upon. In the 1950s, the district wanted to construct a new high school to address overcrowding. The new school was to be named Vallecitos High School and located at the present- day North Broadway site. Two bond measures were required to fund construction. When the district began the process of submitting the second bond measure, the state confronted them with the old inspection report. The state again declared the campus unsafe and then required the district to vacate EHS before attempting the bond measure. Classes were moved to the partially completed Vallecitos High, temporary tents, and the buildings at EHS that were still considered safe. The North Broadway campus was completed in 1954. The Vallecitos name was dropped and the campus took the Escondido High name. The downtown campus was fully demolished in the mid-1980s.

Description Species of Dicranolasma range in body length from three to 6.4 mm. Most parts of the body are encrusted with soil particles. The anterior region features a large headlike \\"hood\\" with the eyes in center, which consists of two curved processes. The chelicerae and pedipalps are both hidden under the hood in adults and about half as long as the body. The legs are short. Immature forms are quite different from adults. The immature form of D. opilionoides was even described as a different genus (Amopaum). The hood develops only gradually, so in young Dicranolasma the relatively longer pedipalps are carried outside the hood. (2007): Dicranolasmatidae Simon, 1879. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 142ff Distribution Dicranolasmatidae occur mainly in the Mediterranean region northward to the southern Alps, the Carpathians, eastward to the Caucasus and Iraq, the Levant and southward to western North Africa. Relationships The Dicranolasmatidae are closely related to the Trogulidae and Nemastomatidae, with Trogulus probably sister to Dicranolasma.

The plot is based on a real incident in the life of British Air Marshal Sir Victor Goddard; his journal was published in The Saturday Evening Post of 26 May 1951.\\"Obituary of Sir Victor Goddard.\\" The Times, January 1987. The film stars Michael Redgrave, Sheila Sim and Alexander Knox. This was Sim's final film before her retirement from acting. Plot summary A senior Royal Air Force officer (Michael Redgrave) is at a dinner party in Hong Kong at which one of those present (Michael Hordern), a naval Commander, talks about a dream he had in which the Air Marshal and a group of 7 other companions were flying in a Dakota which crashed on a rocky shore. The Air Marshal is due to fly to Tokyo the following day but is not disturbed because many of the details differ from his planned voyage, including using a different kind of aircraft, a Consolidated Liberator. When problems ground the planned aircraft, a Dakota airliner - like the one seen in the dream - is substituted, and a number of other passengers arrive to make the total number of people on board 13 (8 passengers and 5 crew members), the same number of people in the dream. As the flight proceeds, other circumstances change so that eventually most of the details correspond to the dream. However, instead of crashing, the pilot manages to bring the aircraft down in a controlled emergency landing in a snowfield in the mountains and all on board survive.

It is located on the central coast of Tillamook County, in the northwestern part of Oregon. It is one of six National Wildlife Refuges within the Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex and was the first National Wildlife Refuge west of the Mississippi River. In 1970 the Refuge was designated as wilderness. It is one of the smallest wilderness areas in the United States.Three Rocks Wilderness - Wilderness.net  Geography  Three Arch Rocks consists of on three large and six small rocky islands located about a half mile (1 km) offshore from Oceanside. It is one of the smallest designated wilderness areas in the U.S., but features the largest colony of breeding tufted puffins and the largest common murre colony south of Alaska. It is the only northern Oregon pupping site for the threatened Steller sea lion.  History  Common murre colony at Three Arch Rocks. The refuge was established by President Theodore Roosevelt after being persuaded by two young conservationists — William L. Finley and Herman Bohlman — who studied and photographed Three Arch Rocks from Oceanside beginning in 1901. They recorded hunters killing dozens of sea lions at a time for skin and oil, and sportsmen shooting seabirds purely for sport. Due to a scarcity of regional chicken farms at the time, seabird eggs were priced at up to a dollar per dozen, encouraging egg harvesting and reducing the bird colony population. Finley and Bohlman suggested a wildlife refuge to Roosevelt to protect dwindling populations and ensure survival of seabird and marine mammal populations. Roosevelt declared the Three Rocks area a National Wildlife Refuge in 1907. In 1970 the United States Congress designated the Refuge wilderness. In 1994, there was a sighting of a group of 2 or 3 North Pacific right whales, the most rare and endangered of all large whales at the Rocks. Protection View from the south View from the Cape Meares Light The Three Arch Rocks Refuge has provided protection for Oregon's largest seabird nesting colony of more than 230,000 birds since October 14, 1907. The entire Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex protect over a million nesting seabirds, including common murres, tufted puffins, cormorants, and storm- petrels.  Access  The islands are closed to public access. Boats must remain at least 500 ft (150 m) away during summer months, and aircraft must maintain at least clearance.

Procession near Ploumanach Léon Augustin Lhermitte (31 July 1844, Mont-Saint-Père - 28 July 1925, Paris) was a French naturalist painter and etcher whose primary subject matter was rural scenes depicting peasants at work. Life and work He was a student of Lecoq de Boisbaudran, he gained recognition after his show in the Paris Salon in 1864. His many awards include the French Legion of Honour (1884) and the Grand Prize at the Exposition Universelle in 1889. Lhermitte’s innovative use of pastels won him the admiration of his contemporaries. Vincent van Gogh wrote that \\"If every month Le Monde Illustré published one of his compositions ... it would be a great pleasure for me to be able to follow it. It is certain that for years I have not seen anything as beautiful as this scene by Lhermitte ... I am too preoccupied by Lhermitte this evening to be able to talk of other things.\\"Léon Lhermitte 1844-1925, ex. cat., Beverley Hills: New York: Galerie Michael; Altman/Burke Fine Art, 1989, unpaginated Lhermitte is represented in the collections of museums around the world, including Amsterdam, Boston, Brussels, Chicago, Florence, Montreal, Moscow, Paris, Rheims, and Washington. Artwork =The Gleaners= The Gleaners Léon- Augustin Lhermitte's The Gleaners (1887, Philadelphia Museum of Art). A part of the Realism movement and an avid realist painter, Lhermitte depicts the working class poverty in France. Taking very obvious inspiration from Millet, a painting of the same name, Lhermitte in a series of works displayed at the Salon aims to capture this moment in time. When comparing his work to Millet's, even the poses of the women are very similar if not the same. In the foreground there are two women bent over picking up the grains left behind. An obvious difference between this work and Millet's is that there is no large crowd of people working in the background. Similarly though the women grasp the wheat in their hands on the left is shown a cache of what they have collected. This is vastly different from Millet's as his showed how little there was left. Lhermitte shows quite a bit of excess. When viewing the ground, identifying individual wheat grains is difficult if not impossible. This could be a representation of how difficult the work is, the endless task of gathering enough wheat to keep the families of these women fed. Around the same time the painting by Lhermitte was published and presented at the Salon, Millet's own \\"The Gleaners\\" was beginning to receive public appreciation. This led Lhermitte to continue painting scenes of rural France, many of which share the same name, \\"The Gleaners\\". Looking closely at the individual gleaners, they are each given some individual \\"character\\". Rather than having plain smooth looking clothes like in Millet's painting, Lhermitte opted for looser fitting shirts and added more detail to the faces of the women. The second woman reaching down has a pained expression on her face, showing the effort of reaching down all day. While the women in Millet's painting share the same traits, the women in Lhermitte's have different expressions. The two standing women each hold their bundle as if they are taking a small break, while the woman at the far end has her hand on her back and an exasperated look on her face. This piece leaves the viewer without a sense of closure, as it seems the day is just beginning and a hard day of work is still ahead. =The Tavern Interior= Léon-Augustin Lhermitte's The Tavern Interior (1880 or 1881, Chimei Museum, Tainan, Taiwan).

The street in particular and the area in general was associated with tailors. In particular, the leading Regency London tailors Schweitzer and Davidson were located in Cork Street. Beau Brummell (1778–1840), who introduced the flamboyant form of gentleman's fashion that became known as dandyism, patronised Schweitzer and Davidson in Cork Street. Savile Row, not far from Cork Street to the east, is now the street most associated with high-quality gentleman's tailors today. In the early 20th century, the street became associated with the art world. Cork Street is today known in the art world for its many commercial art galleries. It is close to the Royal Academy on Piccadilly to the south, when has an interest in the artistic nature of the street. , there are 22 galleries in the street. The street is considered to be one of the United Kingdom's \\"most important art hubs\\". The galleries of Cork Street have launched the careers of many major modern artists in Britain. For example, the Mayor Gallery was the venue for the first London exhibitions of Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, and Joan Miró. Peggy Guggenheim opened her 'Guggenheim Jeune' art gallery at number 30 in 1938.

In 1985 the Grey Organisation, a radical arts collective, launched an attack on Cork Street covering some of the galleries in grey paint. In a press release, GO justified the attacks on Cork Street, describing the galleries established there as \\"boring and lifeless\\", stating they \\"intended to liven up their lives a bit!\\". The attack took place on Tuesday 21 May 1985, somewhere between midnight and 6am. Members of the Grey Organisation were later arrested, released on bail and banned from central London, but when prosecuted at Well Street Magistrates' court, pleaded 'Not Guilty' and were released without charge. Campaign In 2012 the Save Cork Street campaign was created to protect Cork Street as a contemporary arts district. With 13,000 supporters, including David Hockney and Sir Peter Blake, the Save Cork Street campaign attracted major press interest. Chaired by artist and curator Simon Tarrant, the Save Cork Street committee petitioned Westminster Council to stipulate gallery usage for future Cork Street developments.

It has been listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List since 1986, as the remaining population totals less than 4,000. A population decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (24–30 years) is projected to continue. The global population has been estimated at 3,400 individuals, of which 3,100 (91%) live in India, mostly in Assam.Choudhury, A. (2010). The vanishing herds: the wild water buffalo. Gibbon Books, Rhino Foundation, CEPF & COA, Taiwan, Guwahati, India. The wild water buffalo is the probable ancestor of the domestic water buffalo. Taxonomy Water buffalo sculpture, Lopburi, Thailand, 2300 BCE Bos arnee was the scientific name proposed by Robert Kerr in 1792 who described a skull with horns of a buffalo zoological specimen from Bengal in northern India. Bubalus arnee was proposed by Charles Hamilton Smith in 1827 who introduced the generic name Bubalus for bovids with large heads, convex-shaped narrow foreheads, laterally bent flat horns, funnel-shaped ears, small dewlaps and slender tails. Later authors subordinated the wild water buffalo under either Bos, Bubalus or Buffelus.Ellerman, J. R., Morrison-Scott, T. C. S. (1966). Checklist of Palaearctic and Indian mammals 1758 to 1946. Second edition. London: British Museum of Natural History. Pp 383–384. In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature placed Bubalus arnee on the Official List of Specific Names in Zoology, recognizing the validity of this name for a wild species. Most authors have adopted the binomen Bubalus arnee for the wild water buffalo as valid for the taxon. Only a few DNA sequences are available from wild water buffalo populations. Wild populations are considered to be the progenitor of the modern domestic water buffalo, but the genetic variation within the species is unclear, and also how it is related to the domesticated river and swamp buffaloes. Characteristics Skull of a wild water buffalo in the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology The wild water buffalo has an ash-gray to black skin. The moderately long, coarse and sparse hair is directed forward from the haunches to the long and narrow head. There is a tuft on the forehead, and the ears are comparatively small. Its head-to-body-length is with a long tail and a shoulder height of . Both sexes carry horns that are heavy at the base and widely spreading up to along the outer edges, exceeding in size the horns of any other living bovid. The tip of the tail is bushy; the hooves are large and splayed. It is larger and heavier than the domestic water buffalo, and weighs from . The average weight of three captive wild water buffaloes was . It is among the heaviest living wild bovid species, and is slightly smaller than gaur. Distribution and habitat A herd of wild water buffaloes in Kaziranga National Park, Assam The wild water buffalo occurs in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Thailand, and Cambodia, with an unconfirmed population in Myanmar. It has been extirpated in Bangladesh, Laos, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. It is associated with wet grasslands, swamps, flood plains and densely vegetated river valleys. In India, it is largely restricted to in and around Kaziranga, Manas and Dibru- Saikhowa National Parks, Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary and Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary and in a few scattered pockets in Assam; and in and around D'Ering Memorial Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh. A small population survives in Balphakram National Park in Meghalaya, and in Chhattisgarh in Indravati National Park and Udanti Wildlife Sanctuary. This population might extend into adjacent parts of Odisha. In the early 1990s, there may still have been about 3,300–3,500 wild water buffaloes in Assam and the adjacent states of northeast India. In 1997, the number was assessed at less than 1,500 mature individuals. Many surviving populations are thought to have interbred with feral or domestic water buffaloes. In the late 1980s, fewer than 100 wild water buffaloes were left in Madhya Pradesh. By 1992, only 50 animals were estimated to have survived there. Nepal's only population lives in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and has grown from 63 individuals in 1976 to 219 individuals in 2009. In spring 2016, the population was estimated at 433 individuals including 180 adult females and 114 adult males. In 2016, 18 individuals were translocated from Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve to Chitwan National Park. In and around Bhutan's Royal Manas National Park, a small number of wild water buffaloes occur. This is part of the sub-population that occurs in India's Manas National Park. In Myanmar, a few animals live in Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary. In Thailand, wild water buffaloes have been reported to occur in small herds of less than 40 individuals. A population of 25–60 individuals inhabited lowland areas of the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary between December 1999 and April 2001. This population has not grown significantly in 15 years, and is maybe interbreeding with domestic water buffaloes. The population in Cambodia is confined to a small area of easternmost Mondulkiri and possibly Ratanakiri Provinces. Only a few dozen individuals remain.Tordoff, A. W., Timmins, R. J., Maxwell, A., Huy Keavuth, Lic Vuthy and Khou Eang Hourt (eds). (2005). Biological assessment of the Lower Mekong Dry Forests Ecoregion. WWF Greater Mekong Programme. Phnom Penh, Cambodia The wild water buffaloes in Sri Lanka are thought to be descendants of the introduced domestic water buffalo. It is unlikely that any true wild water buffaloes remain there today. Wild-living populations found elsewhere in Asia, Australia, Argentina and Bolivia are feral domestic water buffaloes. Ecology and behavior Wild water buffaloes are both diurnal and nocturnal. Adult females and their young form stable clans of as many as 30 individuals which have home ranges of , including areas for resting, grazing, wallowing, and drinking. Clans are led by old cows, even when bulls accompany the group. Several clans form a herd of 30 to 500 animals that gather at resting areas. Adult males form bachelor groups of up to 10 individuals, with older males often being solitary, and spend the dry season apart from the female clans. They are seasonal breeders in most of their range, typically in October and November. However, some populations breed year round. Dominant males mate with the females of a clan who subsequently drive them off. Their gestation period is 10 to 11 months, with an inter-birth interval of one year. They typically give birth to a single offspring, although twins are possible. Age at sexual maturity is 18 months for males, and three years for females. The maximum known lifespan is 25 years in the wild. In the wild in Assam, the herd size varies from three to 30 individuals. They are probably grazers by preference, feeding mainly on graminoids when available, such as Bermuda grass, and Cyperus sedges, but they also eat other herbs, fruits, and bark, as well as browsing on trees and shrubs. They also feed on crops, including rice, sugarcane, and jute, sometimes causing considerable damage.Lēkhakun, B., Mcneely, J. A. (1988). Mammals of Thailand. 2nd edition.

Endangered animals of Thailand. Issue 6 of Flora & Fauna handbook. Sandhill Crane Press. Threats A population reduction by at least 50% over the last three generations seems likely given the severity of the threats, especially hybridization; this population trend is projected to continue into the future. The most important threats are: * interbreeding with feral and domestic water buffaloes in and around protected areas; * hunting, especially in Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar; * habitat loss of floodplain areas due to conversion to agriculture and hydropower development; * degradation of wetlands due to invasive species such as stem twiners and lianas; * diseases and parasites transmitted by domestic livestock; * interspecific competition for food and water between wild water buffaloes and domestic stock.

The Cape Meares Light, which marked the cape at night from 1890 until 1963, is now open to the public. Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge and Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge are easily seen from the cape. It is the only point in the United States from which three refuges can be seen at the same time.  Wildlife viewing  The Oregon Coast Trail passes through the center of this headland and interpretive displays along the trail describe the varied wildlife. From this trail, it is possible to see migrating gray whales, three species of scoters, western grebes, and common loons. A wildlife viewing deck, part of the Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint, provides views of the refuge's sea cliffs and inshore islands. In season, visitors can see the aerie of a nesting peregrine falcon pair. Each spring thousands of seabirds return to nest on the cliffs. Species that can be seen are brants, pelagic cormorants, common murres, tufted puffins, pigeon guillemots, western gulls, and black oystercatchers. This state park has of hiking trails and a walking trail through the forest of sitka spruce and western hemlock.  The Cape Meares Giant  Some of the trees on the refuge are hundreds of years old and more than tall. The Cape Meares Giant, a sitka spruce, is of special interest. After the Great Coastal Gale of 2007 killed the Klootchy Creek Giant, once considered the largest sitka spruce in the world, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) granted a special use permit to Ascending the Giants, a Portland based organization, which allowed them to climb and measure the Cape Meares Giant. Based on the results, the FWS issued a press release in February 2008 that announced that the tree is the largest known Sitka spruce in the state and that it was designated an Oregon Heritage Tree. Oregon's actual largest Sitka Spruce, using a point system, is Falcon's Tower, discovered and measured by Certified Arborist M. D. Vaden. Cape Meares Giant Spruce had only 743 points, whereas Falcon's Tower was documented at 750 points by M. D. Vaden. Falcon's Tower is in Oswald West State Park, between Cannon Beach and Manzanita, Oregon.

Manufactured by EVI of Sterling Heights, Michigan, it sold for less than $400. Although it offered luggage space and was marketed as a fun and practical vehicle, it offered limited weather protection and was not fast enough to substitute for a car. The PPV may be considered a forerunner of the modern velomobile. This tricycle was manufactured with a three-speed, floor shift, open type transmission with a single-wheel drive. Either the driver or the passenger could pedal independently or as a team. Reverse was accomplished by reaching outside and turning one of the rear wheels by hand. At one time, a rear-hinged, surrey top was available. Most were manufactured with a dark blue bottom and a white hood. Red or yellow bottoms with white tops were also offered. Sometimes bicycle accessories were added, e.g. squeeze bulb horn and a rear view mirror. The PPV was designed for two adult riders, and with frame and body the total weight could approach three times that of a conventional single-rider bicycle. However, the PPV was fitted with just one brake, of a type intended to be just one of two brakes on a conventional single-rider bicycle (an Atom drum brake built in to the front wheel). Thus, even at relaxed speeds on level ground, the PPV brakes were dangerously inadequate. An upgraded version of this vehicle is currently (2011) being offered by the International Surrey Company Ltd. under the trade name Impello.

The term was defined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 1990, in the case of Foster, A and others v. British Gas plc.Full text: The ECJ's ruling defines the term as: > A body, whatever its legal form, which has been made responsible, pursuant > to a measure adopted by the state, for providing a public service under the > control of the state and has for that purpose special powers beyond that > which result from the normal rules applicable in relations between > individuals. The term is most obviously used to describe public sector employers, such as the police, fire service, local government bodies or schools. Foster, A and others v. British Gas plc This case was referred to the ECJ by the House of Lords in 1990. The issue to be decided was whether employees of a nationalised industry (in this case British Gas plc) could rely upon the Equal Treatment Directive when making claims in the English courts. British Gas dismissed female employees when they reached 60, the compulsory retirement age for women at the time, but male employees were not required to retire until 65. At the time, the Sex Discrimination Act did not prevent discrimination in retirement age, so the employees' only recourse was to the Equal Treatment Directive. The court found in favour of the employees. The gist of the finding was that when a state has failed to implement a directive as required, that state should not be allowed to benefit from the failure. Therefore, the provisions of the Equal Treatment Directive (and any other EU directive) can be relied upon against any organisation that is an emanation of the state.

The building was the former administrative headquarters of the County Borough of Birkenhead, and more recently, council offices for the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Birkenhead Town Hall remains the location of the town's register office. However, since the closure of the Wirral Museum in 2010, there is uncertainty over the future purpose of the Grade II* listed building. History When Hamilton Square was designed in the early 19th century, a plot of land was made available for the siting of a town hall between Hamilton Street and Chester Street. However, it wasn't until 1887 that the current building was completed. Designed by local architect Christopher Ellison in 1882, the building was constructed using Scottish granite and sandstone from the now filled-in local quarry at Storeton. The building consisted of a council chamber, offices, with a concert hall and function rooms known as the Assembly Rooms. Birkenhead's magistrates' court chambers are located in a separate building of the same design to the rear. The clock tower is 200 feet in height and consists of four faces. After a fire in 1901, the upper part of the clock tower was rebuilt to a design by Henry Hartley. The rebuilding included a stained glass window by Gilbert P. Gamon representing Edward I's visit to Birkenhead Priory in 1277. Despite the abolition of the County Borough of Birkenhead on 1 April 1974, the building continued to be used as council offices until the early 1990s, when work was undertaken to restore the external stonework and many interior decorations and features, including the former council chamber. The Wirral Archives Service was based in the building until 2008, when it transferred to the council's Cheshire Lines Building nearby. The service collects and stores all types of historical documents relating to the Wirral area, its people, businesses and institutions. Amongst the records in the collection are documents and photographs from Birkenhead's Cammell Laird shipyard, when the original company closed in 1993. Between 2001 and 2010, the Wirral Museum occupied a significant portion of the building. It featured both themed and permanent exhibits such as the history and development of Wirral, the Cammell Laird collection, the Wirral Silver and Mayoral collections, Della Robbia Pottery and a detailed scale model of the historic Woodside area in 1934. Current uses Birkenhead Town Hall still retains some civic service, such as the municipal registration centre for births, marriages and deaths and as a venue for local and national elections. It is also utilised for the celebration of notable occasions and as the town's focal point for annual Remembrance Sunday ceremonies. Some of the grand civic rooms are also used for social events including weddings. Future In 2009 owners Wirral Borough Council advertised the building for sale or lease, as part of its Strategic Asset Review. The council has invited \\"expressions of interest from individuals and organisations who can demonstrate that they can secure a sustainable use for this important building.\\" See also *Listed buildings in Birkenhead References External links * Birkenhead Town Hall bells * Wirral Archives Service Buildings and structures in Birkenhead Grade II* listed buildings in Merseyside Tourist attractions in Merseyside City and town halls in England Government buildings completed in 1887 ","title":"Birkenhead Town Hall"},{"id":"13283309","text":"Bruce M. Bailey, (born August 10, 1935), is an American author and humorist who also used the pen name of R. Adam Solo. Bailey's original name was Marion Bruce Bailey, but he was called \\"Bruce\\" by family and friends. Upon entering the military, he was informed that he would be addressed by his first name, not middle name or a nickname. He immediately proceeded to the local court house and officially changed his name to Bruce Marion Bailey. Bruce spent a career in the military flying reconnaissance missions, and upon retiring turned to writing. Early life Bruce was born in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, a rural agricultural town, and spent his youth there involved in typical activities of a small town boy. He was first son of Sidney Bailey and Flayvelle Florence Bruce, his brother John was borne 12 years later. Bruce was highly intelligent and often found mischief and mayhem as he sought fun and fulfillment in a small town. During his youth he developed a great love for aviation and aircraft of all types. As many of America's youth did, he watched the aircraft and the AAF with close interest during the second world war, collecting as many cards, pictures, and data about military airframes as possible. =Military career= He served as Honorary Sergeant and Bugler for an elite National Guard unit for 4 years while still in school (grades 6-10). He started college at Mississippi State and bounced from school to school for nearly 2 years before enlisting in the Marine Corps. He spent 2 years as a reservist in and out of Camp Lejeune and Okinawa, but Marine life did not suit him. He often said the only thing they taught was how to hate and fight, so transferred to the U.S. Air Force Aviation Cadet program designed to commission officers for flight duties (pilots and navigators). Cadets enabled him to fulfill his dream of flying. His latest book, The Elite, tells of his time spent in that program. His career in the Air Force (1956–77) was spent primarily as an Electronics Warfare Officer flying reconnaissance missions during the cold war. He has written several books on the subject and has become a sought-after authority. Bruce has flown different types of aircraft, but most of his 9,000 hours were spent in the RB-47 and RC-135. Throughout most of his career he flew combat missions and wore the Combat Crew badge. During the height of the Cold War he was constantly either \\"On Call\\" or deployed. Air Force life was much better suited to Bruce. He was a highly effective leader and widely recognized as such by his peer and superior officers. The Air Force also allowed him to put his intellectual capacity to work. Quickly mastering electronics and Radio Frequency theory and processing, he quickly dominated his specialized field within the community. By the time of his retirement, Bruce had been awarded the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross several times, and many other medals and awards. His life in the military enabled him to travel the world where he had the opportunity to meet and interact with a wide range of people and cultures. =Life as an Author= Upon retirement, he turned his attention to writing and has published several volumes of historical fiction and non-fiction. In addition to authoring books, he has also written several magazine articles for US and UK publications. Bruce is also sought out as an authority on the Cold War. He has appeared on numerous television programs and magazine interviews, both in the US and Europe. =Family life= Bruce married Fay Louise Olsen on 12 March 1960, in Topeka, Kansas. They have 4 children; Patti, James, Susie, and John. Bruce has retired to live in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area. Publications *The Elite: The Chosen Few, 2007, *Rencounter (By R.

Pegeia is situated mainly on the steep slopes of the coastal hills inland from Coral Bay, at the southern end of the Akamas Peninsula, and it lies 14 km northwest of Paphos. It has a large population of British immigrants and a growing number of holiday homes and apartments. In the town centre can be found the town hall, a church, a police station and several small shops, restaurants and banks. Due to its hillside location many parts of the town offer views over Coral Bay and Paphos. Pegeia actually covers a large area stretching from the Pegeia Forest on the hills high above the village in the north, to the sea in the south, and from the Bay of Maa in the east to the Akamas Peninsula in the west. However the name is used more frequently in respect to the town. History Yeronisos island, Pegeia =Pegeia Name History= The origin of the name Pegeia, is said to derive from the Latin word Baia (Bay) due to the close proximity of Coral Bay (Maa), which served as a natural safe docking for Egyptian cargo vessels dating back to antiquity. The village was first settled by Venetians, during the Venetian Domination of Cyprus (1489-1570), probably by Venetian merchant sailors and or by sailors of the Venetian fleet in conflict with the Ottomans over Cyprus rule. The beginning of the Ottoman rule (1571-1878), saw the relationship between the Orthodox and the Ottomans healthier than in comparison with the Catholic and Ottomans, as a result many of the Venetian settlements on the island, that of Pegeia included, had by then already assimilated into Orthodox Christianity as well as Greek-Cypriot way of life. Distinctively one can notice that the Cypriot Greek dialect in this region, including nearby villages of Kathikas, Akoursos, and Kissonerga has a characteristic singing and fluctuating tone that resembles very much the Italian way of speech. This can be more distinctively noticeable in conversations amongst elders. = Pegeia Vrisi = In the past, villagers had to collect their water from the local spring or 'vrisi'. It was here that everyone met, especially the young men of the village who would congregate to watch the young girls collecting water in their red clay pitchers. It is said that to drink the Pegeia spring water made the girls beautiful and several songs were written about the vrisi, one of which, 'Spring of Pegeia Woman' is still sung today. The vrisi is still visible though little visited except by newly weds, as this is where a great number of wedding ceremonies are now conducted. The vrisi is in a paved area to one side of the municipal car park in the centre of the village.https://web.archive.org/web/20080908023343/http://www.peyiacommunityassociation.org/mp.html Geography =Climate= Culture Concise presentation of Pegeia =Local Amenities= Pegeia, like many other towns in the Paphos region, sports a large number of cafes and restaurants along the main road of Coral Bay. More places to eat are being built on the next road in, to the east of the main strip, suggesting there is no shortage of demand. These range from taverns, meze houses and traditional cafes, to themed restaurants hosting, for example, Cypriot nights. The next significant town is Kathikas, which again has an impressive range of eateries, as well as the Sterna Winnery. The town is serviced by butchers, a fish market and a bakery, in addition to the large supermarket called Phillipos opposite the church. =Sports= The towns' football team APOP Kinyras Peyias FC formerly played in the Cypriot First Division but dissolved after bankruptcy in 2012. Now the town's current football team is Peyia 2014 which was formed by a merger of Peyia FC 2012 and PAS Peyia. In the 2018/19 season they compete in the Cypriot Third Division. =Notability= Since 2019, the town has received increased media coverage since professional footballer Gerard Piqué and international pop singer Shakira acquired a residence in the region.Shakira’s New Villa in Cyprus Will Blow Your MindShakira and Pique purchase luxury villa in Paphos References Municipalities in Paphos District ","title":"Pegeia"},{"id":"13283339","text":"Paul Andre Banke (born March 1, 1964 in Blythe, California) is a former World Boxing Council Super Bantamweight champion boxer, and is the first American boxer to go public with an AIDS diagnosis.

Like her sister, Caroline of Brunswick, Augusta had a scandalous personal life and an unhappy marriage. Early life Princess Augusta was born in Brunswick, the eldest child of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, the elder sister of George III of the United Kingdom. She was named in honour of her mother, and within the family, she was generally called \\"Zelmira\\". Augusta was the eldest of seven children, and of her younger sister, Princess Caroline, would marry the future George IV of the United Kingdom. Marriage Coat of Arms of Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel On 15 October 1780, at the age of 15, Augusta was married in Brunswick to Prince Frederick of Württemberg, eldest son of Frederick Eugene, himself the youngest brother of the reigning Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg. As neither the reigning Duke nor his other older brother had any sons, Frederick's father (and then Frederick himself) was expected to succeed in time as Duke of Württemberg. That eventuality was however many years in the future, and the birth of a legitimate heir would end Frederick's hopes conclusively. Moreover, his uncle the Duke was not disposed to give any member of his family any role in affairs of government. Frederick therefore determined to make a career abroad. His sister Sophie was married to Tsesarevich Paul, future Emperor of Russia. In 1782, Frederick accompanied Sophie and her husband to Russia, following a Grand Tour of Europe that the imperial couple had undertaken. Pleased with the well-spoken and confident young man, the Empress Catherine II appointed Frederick Governor-General of Eastern Finland, with his seat at Viipuri. =Separation= Augusta joined her husband in Viipuri. In the next five years, the couple would become the parents of four children. However, Augusta and Frederick did not have a happy marriage. During a visit to Saint Petersburg in December 1786, Augusta fled to the apartments of Empress Catherine to ask for protection. She alleged that Frederick was bisexual, that he had a coterie of young noblemen, and that he was violent towards her. A horrified Catherine gave Augusta asylum in her palace and sent word to Frederick that it would be best for him to leave Russia, at least for the time being. Sophie protested at this treatment of her brother, and Catherine replied curtly, \\"It is not I who cover the Prince of Württemberg with opprobrium: on the contrary, it is I who try to bury abominations, and it is my duty to suppress any further ones.\\" Augusta's father was less sympathetic, and he refused his daughter's plea for a divorce when she sent the request to him from Russia. Before he left, Frederick made it known through Sophie to the Empress that he regarded his wife to be as of \\"poor character\\" as she behaved with too much informality with servant-lads, grooms and aides, and that the \\"violence\\" she accused him of was only his insistence that she should behave with adequate reserve towards them, in keeping with what was regarded as suitable for a woman of her high rank. The allegation of bisexuality was never made known to him, but it is notable that Frederick later had a happy marriage, with no hint of either bisexuality or violence, with Princess Charlotte of Great Britain. =Affair and death= Augusta Grave in Kullamaa Church. After Augusta's father had refused to countenance a divorce, and with Augusta showing clear signs of proving her husband right in the matter of behavior with men of lower rank, Catherine found it necessary to make arrangements for her removal from the palace. She gave Augusta the use of one of her Imperial estates, Lohde castle,Lohde castle in Lohde (now Koluvere) in Kullamaa Parish to the south-west of Tallinn, Estonia. Augusta was put in the custody of Wilhelm von Pohlmann (9 April 1727 – 22 January 1796), a former hunt-master. Augusta quickly began a sexual relationship with her custodian, and soon became pregnant by him.Thomsen, Sabine. Die württembergischen Königinnen. Charlotte Mathilde, Katharina, Pauline, Olga, Charlotte – ihr Leben und Wirken (The Queens of Wuerttemberg: Charlotte Matilde, Katharina, Pauline, Olga, Charlotte – Their Lives and Legacies). Silberburg-Verlag, 2006. On 27 September 1788, aged 23, Augusta went into premature labour with a stillborn child, followed by hemorrhaging. Pohlmann refused to send for a doctor or any other medical help, fearful that his illegitimate relationship to her would be exposed. Augusta died of blood loss. She was hurriedly buried in an unmarked grave in the church at Koluvere. Brief letters were then written to the Empress Catherine and to Augusta's father in Brunswick, blandly announcing her death and giving the cause as the breaking of a blood vessel. Sightings of Augusta (or her ghost) were reported for several years in the vicinity of Lohde castle, which suggests some local belief of scandal, tragedy or foul play, but no sighting proved to be true. The facts of her death only came to light many years later, when her eldest son had the matter investigated and her body was exhumed.Thomsen, ibid.

Career Born Gary Lachlan Mack in Calgary, Alberta, he became, on his twenty-second birthday, the youngest news director at AM radio station CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, which also served Detroit, Michigan, as well as Toledo and Cleveland in Ohio and covered twenty-eight states and six provinces. This was during its \\"Big 8/20-20 News\\" period, and also around the time RKO General was forced to sell the station, due to a change in Canadian ownership rules that prohibited foreign firms from controlling Canadian licensed stations. In 1973, he read a Toronto newspaper editorial written by Gordon Sinclair of CFRB in Toronto, a commentary about America. MacGregor then read the patriotic commentary on CKLW Radio as part of a public affairs program and, due to the huge response, he was asked to record \\"The Americans\\" with \\"America the Beautiful\\" performed by The Detroit Symphony Orchestra as the background music. Both MacGregor and Sinclair released recorded versions of the commentary. MacGregor's version of the record (released on Detroit- based Westbound Records) became a bigger hit than Sinclair's in the United States, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of February 9, 1974.Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th Edition, 2000 It became a gold record. In Canada, MacGregor's version hit #1, while Sinclair's hit #24. His recording has sold over three-and-a-half-million copies, and all of his proceeds have been donated to the American Red Cross. MacGregor was honored with the \\"National Americanism Award\\". MacGregor was known for his deep voice and high-energy announcing style at CKLW, and for writing copy in a manner that was compared to that of sensational tabloid newspapers. He later made the transition to a more traditional anchoring and interviewing style when he moved to WWJ Newsradio 950, the CBS Radio all-news station in Detroit, where he served as both morning and afternoon drive anchor during his thirteen-year occupancy. MacGregor also became the first newsman in Detroit to simultaneously anchor prime-time newscasts on both radio (WWJ) and television (WKBD-TV 50). By the mid-1980s, MacGregor held dual citizenships in Canada and the United States. He died on January 3, 1995. His funeral took place at the McCabe Funeral Home in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and at the Shrine of the Little Flower Catholic Church in Royal Oak, Michigan. Having died two months short of his 47th birthday, he was survived by his wife of nineteen years, Jo- Jo Shutty-MacGregor. She was the first female helicopter news and traffic reporter in North America, and today works for WWJ and WOMC and the Metro News Networks. MacGregor was also survived by his sister, Leilani Harvie; by his mother, Murdena MacGregor Mack; and by his brother, Hudson Mack, who was news anchor at CIVI-TV in Victoria, British Columbia.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, he was regarded as one of the foremost British Dante scholars. Career Gardner was born in Kensington in 1869, the fifth of six children of John Gardner, a member of the stock exchange, and his wife Amy Vernon Garratt. His sister was the Polish scholar Monica Mary Gardner.Gerald Stone, ‘Gardner, Monica Mary (1873–1941)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 Nov 2015 He attended Beaumont College in Old Windsor before starting a science degree at University College London. He transferred to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1887, with the intention of reading medicine. His studies were interrupted in 1890 due to health problems that were to persist throughout his life; during his convalescence in Florence, he received his only formal training in Italian from a Florentine bookseller. He eventually graduated with a B.A., having been granted an aegrotat in Part I of the Natural Sciences Tripos. Gardner decided to engage in literary studies instead of following a medical career. In 1893 he was teaching English literature at the Cambridge Extension School and had his first article on Dante published in Nature. He proceeded to contribute to a series of popular travel guides on cities in Italy published by J. M. Dent, while producing a steady scholarly output on Dante, Ariosto and their period. His interest in Roman Catholic mysticism resulted in books on Saint Catherine of Siena, Saint Bernard and Dante and the mystics, in which he argued that Dante was \\"a scholastic in theology but a mystic in religion\\". He wrote several articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia. His academic contributions were recognized with his appointment as Barlow lecturer on Dante at University College London between 1910 and 1926. He was promoted to reader in 1918. The following year he became the first holder of the Serena Professorship in Italian Studies at the University of Manchester. In 1922 he won the Serena Medal of the British Academy, established in 1920. From 1923 to 1925 he was Professor of Early Italian Language and Literature at the University of London, becoming Professor of Italian there from 1925 until his retirement in 1934. In 1925 he became a member of the British Academy. A fund was set up in early 1935 to mark his retirement, its main purpose being to finance the Edmund G. Gardner Memorial Prize in Italian Studies, to be awarded every five years by a committee from University College London. He was appointed an officer of Order of the Crown of Italy in 1921, a commendatore in 1929, and a grand officer in 1935.

Life Anna Maria Schwegelin was born in poverty in the area near Kempten im Allgäu and served as a maid. In 1751, a Protestant was employed as a coachman, and converted to the Catholic faith. Schwegelin tried to prevent this. It is also said that she abandoned her Catholic faith in order to marry a Protestant, but that the marriage plans were broken off. In 1769, she injured her leg, and in 1770, she was put in the poor house. Suspicions of her (and the coachman's) involvement in Satanism led to an arrest; she reportedly freely confessed having made a pact with the Devil. She was judged guilty and sentenced to be executed on 11 April 1775. By July 1775, however, the case seems to have been forgotten, and Schwegelin remained in jail, where she died of natural causes in 1781. It was long believed that this sentence was carried out, and that she was the last person executed for sorcery in Germany. She was the last person to be sentenced to death for sorcery in Germany, but as her execution was never carried out, this is inaccurate. Similarly, she has been described as the last person to be executed for witchcraft in Europe, but this distinction belongs to Barbara Zdunk.

Under the new system, a two-round election system was promulgated, and candidates from any political party require at least 12.5% of the vote to enter the second round of voting, and a general electoral threshold of 5% was set.\\"Textes sur la stabilité politique en Polynésie adoptés, vives critiques PS\\" , AFP (Google.com), 23 November 2007 . Events leading up to the election =2007 political crisis= In July 2007, Former French Polynesian President Gaston Tong Sang was heavily criticized by Gaston Flosse, former President and the founder of Tong Sang's party, Tahoeraa Huiraatira. Flosse accused Tong Sang of caving in too easily to the demands of some of French Polynesia's minor coalition parties and ignoring the needs of Tahoeraa Huiraatira. Critics of Flosse asserted that the attack was merely a move by Flosse to regain the presidency, an accusation bolstered by revelations that Flosse had \\"secret talks\\" with Oscar Temaru, former President and a leading pro-independence politician who has been Flosse's long time political opponent in the past. According to reports, the talks were aimed at ousting Sang from office and setting up a unity platform between Flosse and Temaru's respective political parties. On 29 August 2007, a no confidence motion was introduced by Temaru's Union for Democracy (UPLD). The UPLD said that the no confidence motion against Tong Sang was based on the fact that he had only small support in the Assembly, thus losing his legitimacy to govern. Tong Sang's own Tahoeraa Huiraatira party asked him to resign ahead of the vote of no confidence against him. Tong Sang refused the calls from his party to step down. Tong Sang's government fell after the vote of no confidence was passed by French Polynesia's 57 member Assembly on August 31. The motion Sang was passed by a majority 35 members of the Assembly, including some members of the governing Tahoera'a Huiraatira party. Tong Sang tried to save his government by offering Tahoer'a Huiraatira 7 ministerial posts. The deal was refused. The motion against Tong Sang was the first time that Oscar Temaru's Union for Democracy and Gaston Flosse's Tahoera'a Huiraatira party formed a de facto alliance to oust a sitting French Polynesian government. =Post- crisis= After his ouster from government, Gaston Tong Sang left Tahoera'a Huiraatira and founded a new party, O Porinetia To Tatou Ai'a. The new party, from the onset, had 6 members in the Assembly, all former members of Tahoera'a Huiraatira. After Tong Sang's ouster, which was the third time a French Polynesian government was ousted from power via motions of no confidence since 2004, calls for electoral reform were heard. This culminated in an electoral reform package that was passed by France in November of the same year. After elections were announced, President of French Polynesia Oscar Temaru stated that he would prefer to have elections after the French municipal elections in March 2008. Election results Coalition negotiations According to reports, the two pro-autonomy/anti-independence factions were likely to agree to form the government for the next five years, but coalition talks broke down on 20 February 2008. The President of the Assembly was decided to be elected on 22 February 2008, with presidential elections in the Assembly to follow on 24 February 2008. In the election for the President of the Assembly, the incumbent Edouard Fritch was reelected with 36 votes while the pro- independence candidate Antony Géros received 21 votes; one of the 37 pro- autonomy MPs had therefore evidently voted for Géros.

The Oswego Recreational Trail actually comprises two trails which are separated by an on-road section. It follows the route of the former New York, Ontario and Western Railway, abandoned in 1957. The east portion runs from the city of Fulton's Maple Avenue to the village of Central Square, just short of Interstate 81. I-81 was built following the NYO&W; abandonment and no provision was made to preserve the railroad right-of-way by creating a grade separation. To get around I-81, you must travel on roads through Central Square. North on U.S. Route 11, east on New York State Route 49 across I-81, and south on County Route 37 takes you back to the trail. At that point, the trail to the west (back towards I-81) is ridable, but it ends at a creek where the railroad bridge has been removed. Once back on the trail, it is to Cleveland and the Oneida County line. The right-of-way continues as a privately owned trail, open for some uses. The trail has not been resurfaced except in a few eroded spots. The railroad used crushed rock ballast that remains as the surface of the trail. The trail crosses many steams on the original railroad bridges. They have been decked over with steel. Any road which crosses the trail may be used to gain access to the trail. Convenient parking is available at County Route 6, south of Fulton; on Toad Harbor Road, off Route 49, near Three Mile Bay; and in the village of Cleveland on North Street.

Meaning * Moo – military, chivalry, martial; within the ideograph the inner part of the symbol is the word for \\"stop\\" and the outer part means \\"weapon\\" * Duk – benevolence, virtue, goodness, commanding respect; within the ideograph on the left it means \\"little steps\\" or \\"to happen\\", and on the right the character means \\"moral\\"; thus moral steps or perhaps virtuous conduct * Kwan – large building, palace, library; again within the ideograph the left part looks like a roofed building and technically means \\"to eat\\" (under a roof). Moo Duk Kwan can therefore be loosely translated to \\"School of Martial Virtue\\" History Moo Duk Kwan is the name adopted by Hwang Kee for his martial arts school established in Korea November 9, 1945. Hwang Kee named the first martial art system he taught in his Moo Duk Kwan schools Hwa Soo Do. Later Hwang Kee modified the content of his martial art system and named it Tang Soo Do and eventually he modified his martial art system again and adopted the name Soo Bahk Do to reflect the significant changes incorporated into his system including a new series of hyungs. At the various developments of the art, some of Hwang Kee's students chose to leave the organization, and start new groups in order to keep using the old name of the art and the old curriculum. This has resulted in several different independent groups using the Moo Duk Kwan name for their organizations worldwide, while using different names for their martial art, such as Tang Soo Do, Taekwondo and Soo Bak Do. The Soo Bak Do branch of Moo Duk Kwan in the US considers themselves to be the true Moo Duk Kwan school, and Moo Duk Kwan and Hwang Kee's fist logo are therefore federally registered trademarks 3,023,145 and 1,446,944 and 3,119,287 of Hwang Kee's licensed successor organizations in the US. However, for the origin of the Taekwondo branch of Moo Duk Kwan, one has to look to Korea. In 1961 the Korean government initiated a movement to unify all of its country's martial arts schools under one governing body. This body would originally be called the Korean Tae Soo Do Association and later renamed the Korean Tae Kwon Do Association. The stated purpose was to unify the Kwans and allow for growth of this newly named Korean martial art. \\"A Modern History of Taekwondo\\", reprinted records and minutes of the meetings of the Kwan Unity committee indicating that Hwang Kee was upset that he would not lead the unified group. In March 1965 three of Hwang Kee's senior students, Kim Young Taek, Hong Chong Soo, and Lee Kang Ik, led a significant number of practitioners from Hwang Kee's Moo Duk Kwan schools to join the Tae Kwon Do Kwan Unity Movement and in April 1965 Lee Kang Ik became the president of the new group, which took the name Moo Duk Kwan Taekwondo. Today, the Moo Duk Hae is a social friendship club that endorses the Kukkiwon curriculum. Every year the Moo Duk Hae has an anniversary celebration in Korea, where members from all over the world attend. Attendees include some from the Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan. The Present Day Hwang Kee's Moo Duk Kwan schools have been the birthplace of many esteemed martial artists who today promote a multitude of different martial art systems including Tang Soo Do, Soo Bahk Do, Tae Kwon Do and more. Many practitioners with lineage back to Hwang Kee's Moo Duk Kwan schools consider each other as brothers and may attend each other's special events and tournaments. As founder of the 1st Moo Duk Kwan school on November 9, 1945 Hwang Kee is the progenitor of many practitioners worldwide and who express great admiration for him and his achievements in the martial arts.

It was also later included on the 1996 Tears for Fears compilation album Saturnine Martial & Lunatic. Lyrics According to the Elemental EPK, the song is an account of an encounter with a German photographer who was trying to take pictures of him while he was on-stage. He wasn't in the mood for photos and kept turning his face away and giving her the 'cold' shoulder. He eventually received a note from her later that said 'how can someone who makes such warm music to be so cold'. The first 2 verses of the song describes this event. The song's lyrics, written by Roland Orzabal, contain also references to prior associates of Tears For Fears such as the line \\"Listened to my old friend Nockles, hoped that it would warm the cockles\\" which is a reference to former TFF keyboardist and one time co-writer Nicky Holland whose nickname was \\"Nockles\\". Orzabal also takes a swipe at former Tears for Fears business manager Paul King with the lyric \\"King got caught with his fingers in the till. Where's your calculator, will you leave it in your will?\\" after alleged discrepancies were discovered in King's prior management of the band's financial affairs. King declared bankruptcy in 1990 and, after being found guilty of later fraudulent activities, was imprisoned in 2004 and disqualified from being a company director for a period of ten years.

The second man to achieve a career grand slam of 3 majors (Olympic Gold, World Cup, World Championships). He is considered by many to be one of the greatest players and coaches of all time. He has also played with Kong Linghui in the doubles. Biography Liu Guoliang was born in Xinxiang, Henan. He won two gold medals in the 1996 olympics, the men's singles and the men's doubles (with Kong Ling Hui), he won the men's singles in the 1996 World Cup, the World Doubles Championships in 1997 and 1999 with doubles partner Kong Ling Hui, and the 1999 World Singles Championships in Eindhoven. He was a member of the winning Chinese team in both the 1995 and 1997 World Table Tennis Championships. Liu retired after the 2001 season and was appointed as the head coach of the China's National Men's Team at the age of 27. As the head coach of the Chinese Men's National Table Tennis Team he is the most successful coach in history with a team gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in addition to the medal sweep by Ma Lin, Wang Hao, and Wang Liqin. At the 2012 Summer Olympics the team won gold and Zhang Jike and Wang Hao won gold and silver medals respectively in the men's singles. At the 2016 Summer Olympics the team again won gold and Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the gold and silver medals in the men's singles. The Chinese team has also won every men's singles teams championships in the World Table Tennis Championships since Liu became head coach; a period spanning from 2001 to 2018. On December 1, 2018, Liu was elected as president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, replacing Cai Zhenhua. Equipment His playing style is based on the use of short pimple-out rubber and he uses a penholder grip. He is the forerunner of the backhand reverse topspin. His blade is Stiga Clipper, his forehand rubber is Stiga Clippa and his reverse backhand rubber is Stiga Mendo Energy. During his prime (1996–1999) Liu played with TSP Spinpips on his forehand and Mark V on his backhand, yet still on the Stiga Clipper blade. The Spinpip rubbers was banned in the late 2000 and their counterpart Spinpip Md the year after. Both times because of the aspect ratio (ratio of pips height to width) and its structure of the pip and the arrangement of the pips that made the rubber extremely spinny and unpredictable; and therefore judged to be too advantageous. It is therefore uncertain if Liu actually ever played with Stiga rubbers in competition. Family Liu Guoliang's older brother, Liu Guodong, was the head coach of the Indonesia table tennis national team.

An inscribed dedication suggests the worship there of the Greek mythological figures Heracles and Alcmene. During a rescue excavation alongside the railroad tracks, archaeologists of the Greek Archaeological Service discovered a number of artifacts showing the existence of a sanctuary dating to the archaic period. Items recovered include bronze vases, objects of lead and clay, weapons, iron tools, and figurines. Some specific artifacts named are clay metopes with yellow veneer, spearheads, and part of the arm of a marble statue. One important artifact is a bronze flask (described as \\"navel-shaped\\") in excellent condition with the inscription \\"Tilephilos dedicated me to Herakles\\" in the archaic Greek alphabet. This indicates the presence of a Herakles cult, which is linked to Pherae and is documented in the region through Hellenistic-era inscriptions. The flask had been found several years before its value was recognized when a natural gas pipeline was built near the hill of Spartia by the Volos-Velestinos-Larissa highway (on the site of the ancient Pherae-Pagasses road).

As the Pacific Ocean war neared its climax in late 1944, the need for mine locator vessels became acute, and Industry's sweeping equipment was replaced by sound gear and diving equipment for underwater locator work. She commissioned 15 December 1944 and began training in company with . = Pacific Ocean operations = Industry and two other converted minesweepers departed Pearl Harbor 1 May 1945 and, after stops at Eniwetok, Guam and Saipan, arrived off Okinawa 4 July. There she located and raised mines and sunken Japanese midget submarines during the months that followed. = Fighting off air attacks and typhoons = The ship fought off enemy air raids in July and August, and in September endured a major typhoon. The ship was scheduled to depart for Japan in early October, but her departure was delayed by another typhoon, this one ranking with the most powerful in the recent history of Okinawa. = Wrecked in a typhoon = In the violent storm in Buckner Bay 9 October, Industry drove ashore on a reef. Her crew kept her afloat until rescue came next morning.  Decommissioning  The battered minesweeper was finally stripped and decommissioned 22 December 1945. The remaining hulk was sunk.

Early life and education The son of Wiliam Everett Chalmers and his wife Mary Dunklee Maynard, Gordon Chalmers attended Brown University, where he graduated in 1925. Awarded a Rhodes scholarship, he attended Wadham College at Oxford University for three years, earning his Bachelor's degree in 1928 and his Masters degree in 1934. Returning to the United States, he entered Harvard University, where he earned a masters degree and his Ph.D. in 1933 with a three-volume thesis on \\"Sir Thomas Browne’s thought and its relation to contemporary ideas\\". On 3 September 1929, he married the poet Roberta Teale Swartz, with whom he had three sons and a daughter. Career Chalmers was appointed as an instructor in English at Mount Holyoke College in 1929, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1933. In 1934, he was selected as president of Rockford College and then was later selected as president of Kenyon College in 1937. He remained Kenyon's president until his sudden death at the age of 52. While at Kenyon, Chalmers was responsible for a remarkable transformation of the College, recruiting for it a wide range of prominent scholars. He developed a close friendship with Robert Frost, who he brought to the college on a number of occasions. This relationship was no doubt aided by the fact that he worked with Lesley Frost Ballantine, Frost's daughter, while at Rockford College. He also had a close association with Kenyon English professor John Crowe Ransom. Among the achievements of Chalmers' administration at Kenyon was the establishment of the Kenyon Review. Through Chalmers, Kenyon also became the birthplace of the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Chalmers served as vice president of the Franco-American Audio-Visual Distribution Center from 1948–1953, and president from 1953-1956. He was a member of the National Committee for Fulbright Awards in 1951; chairman of school and college study of admissions with advanced standing from 1951 to 1956, president of the College English Association, 1949–50; president of the Ohio College Association, 1943-45.

This method is based on the mathematical concept of characteristic set introduced in the late 1940s by J.F. Ritt. It is fully independent of the Gröbner basis method, introduced by Bruno Buchberger (1965), even if Gröbner bases may be used to compute characteristic sets.P. Aubry, D. Lazard, M. Moreno Maza (1999). On the theories of triangular sets. Journal of Symbolic Computation, 28(1–2):105–124 Wu's method is powerful for mechanical theorem proving in elementary geometry, and provides a complete decision process for certain classes of problem. It has been used in research in his laboratory (KLMM, Key Laboratory of Mathematics Mechanization in Chinese Academy of Science) and around the world. The main trends of research on Wu's method concern systems of polynomial equations of positive dimension and differential algebra where Ritt's results have been made effective.Hubert, E. Factorisation Free Decomposition Algorithms in Differential Algebra. Journal of Symbolic Computation, (May 2000): 641–662.Maple (software) package diffalg. Wu's method has been applied in various scientific fields, like biology, computer vision, robot kinematics and especially automatic proofs in geometry.Chou, Shang- Ching; Gao, Xiao Shan; Zhang, Jing Zhong. Machine proofs in geometry. World Scientific, 1994. Informal description Wu's method uses polynomial division to solve problems of the form: : \\\\forall x, y, z, \\\\dots I(x, y, z, \\\\dots) \\\\implies f(x, y, z, \\\\dots) \\\\, where f is a polynomial equation and I is a conjunction of polynomial equations. The algorithm is complete for such problems over the complex domain. The core idea of the algorithm is that you can divide one polynomial by another to give a remainder. Repeated division results in either the remainder vanishing (in which case the I implies f statement is true), or an irreducible remainder is left behind (in which case the statement is false). More specifically, for an ideal I in the ring k[x1, ..., xn] over a field k, a (Ritt) characteristic set C of I is composed of a set of polynomials in I, which is in triangular shape: polynomials in C have distinct main variables (see the formal definition below). Given a characteristic set C of I, one can decide if a polynomial f is zero modulo I. That is, the membership test is checkable for I, provided a characteristic set of I. Ritt characteristic set A Ritt characteristic set is a finite set of polynomials in triangular form of an ideal. This triangular set satisfies certain minimal condition with respect to the Ritt ordering, and it preserves many interesting geometrical properties of the ideal. However it may not be its system of generators. =Notation= Let R be the multivariate polynomial ring k[x1, ..., xn] over a field k. The variables are ordered linearly according to their subscript: x1 < ... < xn. For a non-constant polynomial p in R, the greatest variable effectively presenting in p, called main variable or class, plays a particular role: p can be naturally regarded as a univariate polynomial in its main variable xk with coefficients in k[x1, ..., xk−1]. The degree of p as a univariate polynomial in its main variable is also called its main degree. =Triangular set= A set T of non-constant polynomials is called a triangular set if all polynomials in T have distinct main variables. This generalizes triangular systems of linear equations in a natural way. =Ritt ordering= For two non-constant polynomials p and q, we say p is smaller than q with respect to Ritt ordering and written as p <r q, if one of the following assertions holds: :(1) the main variable of p is smaller than the main variable of q, that is, mvar(p) < mvar(q), :(2) p and q have the same main variable, and the main degree of p is less than the main degree of q, that is, mvar(p) = mvar(q) and mdeg(p) < mdeg(q). In this way, (k[x1, ..., xn],<r) forms a well partial order. However, the Ritt ordering is not a total order: there exist polynomials p and q such that neither p <r q nor p >r q. In this case, we say that p and q are not comparable. The Ritt ordering is comparing the rank of p and q. The rank, denoted by rank(p), of a non-constant polynomial p is defined to be a power of its main variable: mvar(p)mdeg(p) and ranks are compared by comparing first the variables and then, in case of equality of the variables, the degrees. =Ritt ordering on triangular sets= A crucial generalization on Ritt ordering is to compare triangular sets. Let T = { t1, ..., tu} and S = { s1, ..., sv} be two triangular sets such that polynomials in T and S are sorted increasingly according to their main variables. We say T is smaller than S w.r.t. Ritt ordering if one of the following assertions holds :(1) there exists k ≤ min(u, v) such that rank(ti) = rank(si) for 1 ≤ i < k and tk <r sk, :(2) u > v and rank(ti) = rank(si) for 1 ≤ i ≤ v. Also, there exists incomparable triangular sets w.r.t Ritt ordering. =Ritt characteristic set= Let I be a non-zero ideal of k[x1, ..., xn]. A subset T of I is a Ritt characteristic set of I if one of the following conditions holds: :(1) T consists of a single nonzero constant of k, :(2) T is a triangular set and T is minimal w.r.t Ritt ordering in the set of all triangular sets contained in I. A polynomial ideal may possess (infinitely) many characteristic sets, since Ritt ordering is a partial order. Wu characteristic set The Ritt–Wu process, first devised by Ritt, subsequently modified by Wu, computes not a Ritt characteristic but an extended one, called Wu characteristic set or ascending chain. A non-empty subset T of the ideal generated by F is a Wu characteristic set of F if one of the following condition holds :(1) T = {a} with a being a nonzero constant, :(2) T is a triangular set and there exists a subset G of such that = and every polynomial in G is pseudo-reduced to zero with respect to T. Wu characteristic set is defined to the set F of polynomials, rather to the ideal generated by F. Also it can be shown that a Ritt characteristic set T of is a Wu characteristic set of F. Wu characteristic sets can be computed by Wu's algorithm CHRST-REM, which only requires pseudo-remainder computations and no factorizations are needed. Wu's characteristic set method has exponential complexity; improvements in computing efficiency by weak chains, regular chains, saturated chain were introducedChou S C, Gao X S; Ritt–Wu's decomposition algorithm and geometry theorem proving. Proc of CADE, 10 LNCS, #449, Berlin, Springer Verlag, 1990 207–220. Decomposing algebraic varieties An application is an algorithm for solving systems of algebraic equations by means of characteristic sets. More precisely, given a finite subset F of polynomials, there is an algorithm to compute characteristic sets T1, ..., Te such that: :V(F) = W(T_1)\\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup W(T_e), \\\\, where W(Ti) is the difference of V(Ti) and V(hi), here hi is the product of initials of the polynomials in Ti.

Lake Eola is the main feature of the park. Also located in the park (on the west side) is the Walt Disney Amphitheater, which hosts many community events and various performances year round. On the east side of the park is a Chinese pagoda, and a playground. The park is surrounded by four streets: East Robinson Street (State Road 526), Rosalind Avenue (SR 527), East Central Boulevard, and North Eola Drive. Lake Eola Lake Eola is a small lake within the South Eola neighborhood of Downtown Orlando, Florida, located at in Lake Eola Park. The lake is actually a sinkhole and is famous for its fountain. The sinkhole is approximately deep and is located east of the fountain. The fountain changes colors at night like a light show. The lake is in circumference and large. A multi-use sidewalk surrounds the water. History In 1883, wealthy Orlando resident Jacob Summerlin—owner of the Summerlin Hotel, the first City Council president, and financial lender for the construction of Orlando's courthouse in the 1870s—donated a large tract of land to establish a park in Orlando. In 1883, Summerlin came to a city council meeting and offered the land around the lake on the condition that it be beautified and turned into a park. He also required that the city plant trees and put a \\"driveway\\" around the lake. To ensure that the city followed through with the stipulations of the donation, Summerlin put reverter clauses in the contract to allow his heirs to reclaim the property if the city failed in its obligations. Several years later, his sons threatened to exercise the reverter clause if the city did not make good on its promise. Today, the park is still maintained according to his requirement that it be kept beautiful. The park was informally established in 1888 using the first parcel of land; it was the first of many that were donated to the City of Orlando by several families. His sons named it Lake Eola, after a lady they both knew. {Of note, the daughter of Maj. Robert Dickinson Allen, 1836 - 1909, and Laura Adelaide Sims, 1842 - 1885, was named Eola J Allen. She was born about 1860. (1860 United States Federal Census Texas Bastrop, Bastrop) She was the niece of John Howard Allen, second mayor of Orlando.} The area was officially declared as a park in 1892. The park area has been home to a zoo; a horse race track; tennis courts; a pier with a dance area; and the broadcast site of a local radio station. The fountain was installed in 1912 at a cost of $10,000. A replacement, originally dubbed the \\"Centennial Fountain,\\" was installed in 1957 at a cost of $350,000. The actual name of the fountain is the \\"Linton E. Allen Memorial Fountain\\". The iconic water feature is an official symbol of Orlando. Lake Eola Park was expanded in 1993 with the closure of Washington Street, which ran between Lee's Lakeside restaurant and the park. With the expansion, the restaurant and Post Parkside Apartments were now located in the park. The International Food Court was also created at this time. In late August 2009, lightning struck the fountain, rendering it inoperable. The city has a $1 million insurance policy on the fountain, with a $500,000 deductible. Because of the city's then-current budget crisis, the fate of the fountain was unknown. On October 15, 2009, Mayor Buddy Dyer announced that the city would not only repair the fountain, but \\"also replace its cracked plastic skin and install a state-of-the-art system of lights and water jets\\" at a cost of $2.3 million. The fountain was rededicated and resumed operation on July 4, 2011. In July 2013 the park expanded to the Southeast to include East Washington Street. The expansion added an extra 1.36 acres of lawn, new LED lighting, widened sidewalks, nearly 4,000 square feet of paved patio and an additional 7,500 square feet of brick paved space on East Washington Street. In September 2013 the City opened Eola House at 12 East Washington Street. The house sits on the expanded part of the park and serves as a welcome center, gift shop and park offices for the Lake Eola Park.A Look Inside the Eola House at Lake Eola Park http://bungalower.com/2013/09/an-look-inside-the-eola-house-at-lake-eola-park/ Also in 2013, six sculptures were installed by the non-profit See Art Orlando.

Designed and constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, this dam substantially reduces flooding along the Quinebaug and Thames rivers. Construction of the project began in June 1960 with completion in August 1962 at a cost of US$5.6 million. The Westville reservoir is located within the Quinebaug River Watershed and is part of the Thames River Basin. Access to the site is available from Interstate 84 and State Route 131. Description View of the Westville Dam The project consists of an earth fill dam with stone slope protection long and high. Located over the outlet channel, the spillway comprises a concrete weir in length. The weir's crest elevation is lower than the top of the dam. The dam creates a permanent lake in size with a maximum depth of The flood storage area for the project covers about in the towns of Southbridge and Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The entire project, including all associated lands, covers . The Westville Dam can store up to of water for flood control purposes. This is equivalent to of water covering its drainage area of . Recreation Areas There is a large picnic/recreation area, with two reserveable picnic shelters located near the south end of the lake. The entrance is on Wallace Road in Sturbridge, near the Quinebaug river bridge. A boat ramp is also located in the recreation area. Camping and swimming are not permitted. There is no entrance fee. The recreation area is open daily during the summer season (3rd Saturday in May to the 2nd Sunday in September) from 8am to 8pm. A loop trail, known as the Westville Lake Community trail, circles the lake. It is open to all non-motorized use. It can be accessed from the recreation area, the damsite parking lot, and the Wallace Road trailhead. The Heritage trail, a walking trail, starts at the damsite and heads north along the river to nearby West Street School. The Grand Trunk Trail, which follows the grade of the never completed Southern New England Railway, leads from the recreation area to River Road in Sturbridge. The western half of the Community Trail loop follows this railbed as well. The trails, including the damsite and Wallace Road parking areas, are open year-round from sunrise to sunset. A canoe launching area and fishing area is located along Old Mashapaug Road west of the recreation area. Canoeists can paddle up the Quinebaug River as far as Turner's Club Field in the village of Fiskdale, approx. upstream. Old Mashapaug Road is open to vehicles during daylight hours from the opening of fishing season in April to the Sunday after Labor Day. A 3/4 mile trail is also available in the Hobbs Brook area of the project, with a trailhead off Hall Road in Sturbridge.

He is notable for being one of the few (and the last) Canadian vice-regal representatives to refuse to give royal assent to a legislative bill. He was a descendant of Peter McMicking (1731–1823), a United Empire Loyalist, and also with Spanish ancestral origins.See last paragraph herein. Bastedo earned his law degree from the University of Toronto in 1909. He moved to Regina two years later to join a law firm there. He was appointed King's Counsel in 1927.Bastedo, Frank Lindsay, Encyclopedia of Saskatachewan A Conservative by party, he headed Regina's Conservative Association from 1921 to 1924 but did not seek the party's nomination for elected office. Bastedo was appointed lieutenant- governor on the advice of Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1958. The lieutenant-governor, like the Governor-General of Canada is a largely ceremonial position, however, as the Queen's representative he does have rarely used reserve powers to veto legislation. Bastedo employed the little-used power to reserve a bill (that is, withhold assent and send the bill to the Governor General of Canada who would grant assent only if the federal Cabinet agrees) proposed by Saskatchewan's Co- operative Commonwealth Federation government of Woodrow Lloyd in 1961.Brian Cole, \\"Ottawa's viceroy\\", Winnipeg Free Press, November 18, 1996 This was the first time a lieutenant-governor had refused royal assent in Canada since 1937 when Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen reserved three bills proposed by the Social Credit government of William Aberhart as unconstitutional. The measure in question, Bill 56, was entitled An Act to Provide for the Alteration of Certain Mineral Contracts. Bastedo issued a statement that \\"this is a very important bill affecting hundreds of mineral contracts. It raises implications which throw grave doubts of the legislation being in the public interest. There is grave doubt as to its validity.\\"J.R. Mallory, \\"The Lieutenant-Governor's Discretionary Powers: The Reservation of Bill 56\\", The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science / Revue canadienne d'Economique et de Science politique, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Nov., 1961), pp. 518-522 Bastedo's constitutional advisors, however, did not share his assessment and advised him to grant royal assent. Bastedo had not consulted with the federal government before taking action. The Diefenbaker government passed an order-in-council approving Bill 56. The Bastedo incident is the last in Canada where a vice-regal representative refused royal assent. Bastedo was the first (and probably the only) Canadian provincial Lieutenant-Governor to have been of Spanish ancestral origin; he is descended from Jacob Bastedo, a Protestant who fled persecution in Spain to the Netherlands centuries ago. From there the family migrated to England, the American Colonies, and then as United Empire Loyalists, to Canada. He was related to the British actress Alexandra Bastedo.From several family ancestry websites on internet. The Bastedo family is said to have been part of the Spanish nobility.

Named after Mount Canobolas and founded in 1966, the school enrolled approximately 630 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom approximately 35 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and five percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Scott Paterson. History Orange was expanding in the mid-1960s, at which time its only government secondary school was Orange High School located in the city's west, so the decision was made to establish a second government high school, to be located in the city's east. The new high school was established in 1966 but lacked a campus, so the first batch of students entering First Form (Year 7) took lessons at Orange High School and were kept separate from other students. This meant there were two parallel sets of Year 7 classes. The new school was originally called East Orange High School and in 1967 operated from a former infants school on Sale Street in what is now the Orange Cultural Centre. The school's name was changed to Canobolas High School when it moved to its current location on Icely Road on 23 March 1968, as the site provided a view of Mount Canobolas and was previously part of Canobolas Shire. The school had a strong multicultural composition as many European migrants had settled in Orange after World War II and housing was built for them in the city's east. Canobolas High School was officially opened on 7 December 1968 by NSW Deputy Premier and Minister for Education and Science, Charles Cutler . The school's first principal was Fred Dobbin, who later served three terms as mayor of Orange. In 1967, the school had 339 pupils and 16 staff. By 1974, it had 815 pupils and 47 staff. Canobolas High School started with three buildings: A, B and C blocks, and initially lacked landscaping. Some of the school's early students helped to plant trees to provide windbreaks and landscaping, and to block the view of Orange City General Cemetery. Logo and motto The school's logo is modeled on the atom. The school's motto is \\"Truth Through Knowledge\\". Healthy canteen Canobolas Rural Technology High School was in 2015 one of three NSW schools selected to take part in a new healthier eating policy introduced by the state government. The school gained nationwide media attention when the canteen doubled its sales after offering fresh fruit, vegetables and other health foods as alternatives to unhealthy traditional Australian school canteen foods such as meat pies and sausage rolls.

It was released on compact disc and digitally through their official website on September 11, 2007. Background Dumas planned to attend a rock and roll benefit show in Atlanta and upon being pressed by friends towards making music, she had responded \\"I couldn't come up with a good enough excuse not to. So I just went for it.\\" Taking the prompts from her friends, she began working with Shane Morton, who was in a relationship with Dumas. Together, they wrote all of the music for the album, which was done primarily on acoustic guitar and in the home of Dumas, particularly on her couch. The Luchagors went into the studio to begin recording in January 2007, and on March 17, 2007, Dumas announced that the band had finished recording all the music for The Luchagors. It was produced by bass player of Skid Row Rachel Bolan, who during the recording and mixing had guided the band and helped with their musical direction. The cover art for the album was made by Morton, which has been likened to the artwork found in DC Comics. The Luchagors has explicit lyrics, and the song \\"All There Is\\" features spoken word in the form of a manifesto. \\"Daddy's Girl\\" has been called pastiche of the music of Holly and the Italians, and their song \\"March of the Luchagors\\" was written as an anthem for their fans. Although some of the songs off of the album are dynamic and aggressive like \\"White Boy\\" and \\"Bastard\\", The Luchagors has songs that are lyrically geared towards conveying a message; the song \\"Crazy World\\" was written for people dissatisfied with society, and aims to motivate them towards changing it. The music has been described as being pop rock and punk, and has been compared to the music of The Ramones, as well as The Misfits. The Luchagors was released independently on September 11, 2007, and appeared for purchase from their official site, as well as in compact disc, and through iTunes. In an interview with Miriam Ramirez of The Monitor, Dumas said of the album \\"every member has put their heart and soul into the record\\". After moderate success and positive feedback, The Luchagors was distributed internationally in Europe. =Supporting tour= By the spring of 2007, The Luchagors were ready to tour in order to support the release of their album The Luchagors,Monroe, p. 68. which began locally in early July 2007. They toured throughout the U.S., as well as in several European venues, such as Belfast, Madrid, and in Leeds. However, in August 2007 and amidst touring, the original and recording drummer Troy King left the band, and had returned by October 2007. On the continuing tour he was replaced by Racci Shay in early 2009. Reception The Luchagors has received positive reviews, and has been called \\"rip-snortin’, candy-coated blast of jumpy, insanely catchy punk rock\\" by Jeff Clark of Stomp and Stammer. Stewart Mason of Allmusic said of the album that it is an \\"easily digestible blend of ramalama bubble-punk\\" and went on to say that they are \\"the sort of semi- ironic trash culture celebrations first pioneered by the Ramones. Wonka Vision views The Luchagors superior in comparison to other wrestling stars' albums and gave it a (3/5), stating that the \\"band’s songwriting tapers off a bit, but overall maintains the feeling of a decent, but dated, punk sound.\\" Track listing :Information on track listing.

Biography Stokes got into the comics industry thanks to his brother George Stokes who already worked for IPC. He lived in India until the age of 8 or 9 and when he returned to England the first comic work he saw was that of his brother and colleagues, as well the Eagle which launched around the same time. This sparked a lifelong interest in comics and he moved from drawing comics in his spare time at school, to trying not to draw comics at art school (where they discouraged his interest), to doing it professionally, starting in the early 1960s. He worked, largely uncredited (as was the way at the time), for IPC for 16 years where, among other things, he drew all 360 instalments of Fishboy as well as a number of other Buster titles. From 1964 to 1967, he also drew the strip 'Britain in Chains' (later editions were entitled 'The Battle for Britain') for Lion; the strip was later reprinted (with a truncated ending) in Smash! between 1969 and 1971. Then, in the late seventies, he was recruited by Dez Skinn to go and work for Marvel UK, initially on The House of Hammer and then on to Black Knight and Doctor Who. In the early to mid-eighties he also worked for other British comics like Warrior and 2000 AD. Following the success of the British Invasion he got more work with DC Comics and Marvel in the early to mid- nineties. In more recent years he has done inking work for DC's imprint Vertigo on The Invisibles with Grant Morrison, who he had worked with previously at Marvel and 2000 AD. He has also returned to 2000 AD after a 15-year hiatus to do more inking work. Influences include Frank Hampson and Frank Bellamy.

H. Macmillan, was an important member of the Bible Students, and later, of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He became a board member of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1918. He presented a history of the religious movement in his book Faith on the March, published in 1957. Early life Macmillan was born in Canada. From an early age he had a deep interest in serving God. At age 16, he decided to be a preacher, attending a school away from home, but ceased his studies when he suffered a nervous breakdown. With financial aid from his father, he relocated to Boston, Massachusetts. There, he came in contact with the Bible Student movement. In about 1897, he obtained a copy of the book, The Plan of the Ages, the first of the six-volume series Millennial Dawn (later called Studies in the Scriptures), written by Charles Taze Russell. He later obtained the second volume in the series, The Time Is At Hand, which claimed that the end of the Gentile Times would occur in 1914. He believed he had finally found biblical truth and later used the books as a basis for his theory that he and others would be 'taken home' to heaven in 1914. Ministry Macmillan first met Russell in 1900. In June of that year, he traveled to Philadelphia to a convention sponsored by the Watch Tower Society. In September, he was baptized in Boston. The following year he became a missionary and full-time minister in Massachusetts. In September 1901 he traveled to Cleveland to attend a convention, after which he was invited by Russell to live at the Watch Tower Society's headquarters in Allegheny. Macmillan traveled extensively with Russell, and in 1905 during a convention tour, he met J. F. Rutherford. Macmillan's proclamation of 1914 In the decades prior to 1914, Watch Tower Society publications claimed that Armageddon would take place in 1914. As the year approached, their publications stated that October 1914 would mark the \\"end of the Gentile Times\\" and the beginning of Christ's kingship. Many Bible Students believed they would be sent to heaven in 1914. At a convention at Saratoga Springs, New York, on September 27–30, Macmillan, believing that \\"the church was \\"going home\\" in October\\", he announced that \\"This is probably the last public address I shall ever deliver because we shall be going home soon.\\" Following the convention, at a meeting at the Brooklyn headquarters, Russell announced: \\"The Gentile Times have ended; their kings have had their day,\\" and added that, \\"At 10:30 Sunday morning Brother Macmillan will give us an address.\\" Those present laughed about Macmillan's previous announcement of his \\"last public address\\"; in the subsequent talk, Macmillan acknowledged, \\"some of us had been a bit too hasty in thinking that we were going to heaven right away\\".\\"Doing God’s Will Has Been My Delight\\", The Watchtower, August 15, 1966, page 62 Despite his expectations for October 1914, Macmillan remained committed to the Watch Tower Society. In 1919, The New York Times characterized Macmillan's address to a meeting of Bible Students as proposing a \\"new date for the Millennium\\" in the year 1925. Watch Tower Society board of directors In Faith on the March, Macmillan described a private meeting he had with Russell in 1916. According to Macmillan, Russell spoke of his poor health and indicated a desire for Macmillan to take over the affairs of the Allegheny office. Russell died several weeks later, on October 31, 1916. By 1918, The New York Times described Macmillan as \\"Superintendent of the Bethel Home\\"\\"Russelites Guilty of Hindering Draft\\", The New York Times, June 21, 1918, As Retrieved 2010-03-02 and as one of \\"the leaders of the International Bible Students Association\\".\\"Russellites to Testify\\", The New York Times, August 20, 1918, As Retrieved 2010-03-02, \\"Alexander H. Macmillan and William E. Van Amburgh, two of the leaders of the International Bible Students Association\\" After the January 5, 1918, annual meeting of the Watch Tower Society, Macmillan joined the Society's board of director, and Rutherford became a board member and president. That year, Macmillan--along with Rutherford and other Watch Tower Society officials--was arrested, charged with violation of the Sedition Act of 1918 as a result of anti-war sentiments expressed in the book, The Finished Mystery; they were sentenced to federal prison in Atlanta, but were released and exonerated in 1919. During the 1920s, Macmillan traveled extensively on service tours to Europe and the Middle East, for public speaking engagements and to monitor activities at branch offices around the world. Such assignments included Scotland,\\"Staying Close to Jehovah’s Organization\\", The Watchtower, July 1, 1987, page 27 Denmark,1993 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, pages 80-81 Finland,1990 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 155 Norway,\\"Norway\\", 1977 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 206 Palestine,Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, ©1993 Watch Tower, page 142 Lebanon and Syria,\\"Lebanon and Syria\\", 1980 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, pages 169-170 Italy,\\"Italy\\", 1982 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 133 and Sweden.1991 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, pages 134-135 Macmillan also traveled throughout the United States and Canada as an appointed \\"pilgrim\\", performing twice-yearly visits with local congregations.\\"Development of the Organization Structure\\", Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, page 222 By the 1930s, Macmillan, based in Brooklyn, was a \\"traveling representative\\" speaking at congregations and larger assemblies, encouraging individuals to pursue the full-time ministry.\\"Pursuing My Purpose in Life\\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1957, page 457 Macmillan also met with local law enforcement and government officials to explain the significance of the dozens of then-recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions which were mostly favorable to Jehovah's Witnesses.\\"Pursuing My Purpose in Life\\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1956, page 456 Macmillan was permitted by the director of the United States Bureau of Prisons to regularly visit Witnesses in federal prisons in the United States who had been incarcerated for refusing military service during World War II.\\"Objects of Hatred by All the Nations\\", Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, page 654\\"United States of America\\", 1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 206 Later years In 1955, Macmillan was granted permission to use Watch Tower Society records to compile a history of Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1957, he published his account, under the title, Faith on the March.Introduction, \\"Faith On The March\\" , Introduction Macmillan became an on-air personality on the Watch Tower Society's radio station WBBR, answering questions and providing counselFaith On The March by A.

It was built around the beginning of the twelfth century as a motte and bailey castle and this was probably replaced mid-century by a stone shell keep. The castle was enlarged in the early thirteenth century, but later fell into ruin. History Tretower about 1820 by Henry Gastineau Tretower (Dictionary of the Placenames of Wales byHywel Wyn owen and Richard Morgan; Gomer Press, 2007) was founded as a motte and bailey castle by Picard, a follower of Bernard de Neufmarché. Probably around 1150, Picard's son, Roger Picard I, replaced the motte with a shell keep. By about 1230 a tall cylindrical keep was added to the inside of the shell keep, possibly by his great-grandson, Roger Picard II, and the space between was roofed over. At this time the earlier bailey was walled in stone and provided with cylindrical corner towers. In the early 14th century residential buildings were constructed away from the original fortifications forming today's Tretower Court. Over time the lords of Tretower favoured the more luxurious Court and the castle fell into disuse. Description of the castle Tretower Castle, as engraved around 1800, showing an impression of its earlier and fullest extent The castle is roughly triangular in plan, with the motte and keep assemblage occupying the western corner. The 12th century shell-keep is an irregular enclosure with a gate-tower on the line of approach from the bailey. In the centre of the shell stands the tall cylindrical 13th century keep. The keep is of three storeys, with an original entrance at first floor level, above a strong, slanted batter or talus. The top of the talus is marked by a decorative string-course of stone.

Pre war As a result of a serious shortage of funds during the inter-war period and a weakness of policy, the RAF was singularly ill-equipped to deal with the requirements of air warfare for the protected storage of explosives. In 1936 the RAF had only three ammunition dumps: at Sinderland, Cheshire; Chilmark, Wiltshire; and Pulham St Mary, Norfolk. The latter and former sites' storage consisted of metal sheds connected by standard gauge rail tracks. In 1935 the standard bomb of the RAF was a device containing high explosives, the largest bomb being . Development of storage There had been some small-scale use of underground munitions stores in Britain during the First World War, although these were more general purpose than specifically for the RAF. Chislehurst Caves, southeast of London, were bought in October 1914 and a small portion of the twenty miles (32 km) of tunnels was prepared for storing up to 1,000 tons of explosives and raw materials for the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, nine miles (14 km) away. Similarly, at the Chilwell Ordnance Factory in Nottinghamshire, a nearby hillside was bored out with a T-shaped storage area in 1915 as part of a total £2.5 million spent on the site, but this could hold barely 300 tons of matériel. Other sites were also acquired but with the end of the conflict all fell into disuse. The Air Ministry estimated in 1936 that a war reserve would contain 98,000 tons of bombs, 82,000 as and bombs and the balance as incendiaries; to save money only 48,000 tons was purchased. The RAF decided to store these weapons in a number of underground depots, each holding 10–30,000 tons. The decision to expend the extra money to store the matérial underground was taken because the thin-walled bombs and inflammable incendiaries were extremely vulnerable to blast, much more so than artillery shells. The planning of the pre-war storage was finalized in 1938, with three underground depots – one each in northern, central and southern England – each of around 25,000 tons capacity; these served eight surface forward depots, termed Air Ammunition Parks (renamed Forward Ammunition Depots in 1941). Each surface depot would have a capacity of around 1,000 tons and would supply armaments to the individual airfields, being positioned within of its recipients. Underground storage medium capacity bombs in one of the tunnels at RAF Fauld. Over a hundred sites were considered and rejected for the RAF's underground storage; many had been pre-empted by the Army and the War Office. A survey in 1929–30 by the Army had found few sites to be satisfactory with regard to capacity, accessibility, locality and safety. Eventually the Army had a shortlist of five (Chislehurst Caves, certain mines near Blaenau, Scout Quarry in Rossendale, the Meadowbank salt mine in Cheshire, and Ridge Quarry near Corsham, Wiltshire) which was reduced to one: Ridge Quarry. The War Office bought Ridge and the nearby Tunnel and Eastlays quarries in mid-1936 for a little under £50,000. The Army went on to spend £4.4 million to create the Central Ammunition Depot at Corsham. In the summer of 1936 the RAF acquired a quarry at Chilmark in Wiltshire for its southern depot and an alabaster mine at Fauld in Staffordshire for its northern depot. Making Fauld suitable for use, including surface buildings, cost around £635,000. For the central depot the RAF was forced to create a store: in 1938 it bought a quarry at Harpur Hill in Derbyshire; concrete storage structures were built within the quarry and the hole then backfilled with waste stone. Difficulties with construction and the weather prevented Harpur Hill from opening until mid-1940. An additional pre-war site for underground storage was later created: a slate quarry at Llanberis was turned into another artificial cavern system with a large two-storey structure built for around £500,000 and opened in June 1941. In May 1941 Linley Caverns near Aldridge, Staffordshire was purchased, but, despite having over £1 million spent on it, Linley was never made useful and was relegated to the storage of obsolete munitions when it finally opened, in January 1943. The poor quality of the RAF stores led to the War Office's providing them with Ridge Quarry, and later part of Eastlays Quarry, at the Central Ammunition Depot. Both were rather poor quality: 96,000 tons of waste stone had to be moved out of Ridge to make it usable and it took over two years to make Eastlays satisfactory for use. The War Office also allowed 4,000 tons of incendiaries to be stored at the nearby Monkton Farleigh Mine.  Ammunition parks  The pre-war Air Ammunition Parks were all constructed to a similar pattern. Close to main railway lines with their own sidings, the sites had one fully enclosed component store, four enclosed stores for incendiaries and usually two groups of paired open-topped concrete storage magazines, each seventy two feet square. All the storage buildings were widely dispersed and had additional shielding with earthworks (termed blast barriers or traverses). Each open magazine was designed to hold 56 tons of bombs. There were additional buildings for the site staff and their needs. The main Air Ammunition Parks were: RAF Barnham, Suffolk (serving RAF Bomber Command), Brafferton, North Yorkshire (serving 4 Group North), Earsham (serving OTUs), Lords Bridge (serving 2 and 3 Groups), Mawcarse (serving Scotland), Norton Disney (serving 5 Group), Snodland (actually at Halling, serving 11 Group F), Southburn (serving 4 Group South), and Staple Halt (serving 11 Group F). All were completed in 1939–40; Staple Halt was closed in July, 1940 and its role was taken over by Snodland, which was itself replaced by a new park at Newdigate in May 1942. Two more were built during the war: South Witham (serving 1 Group F) was completed in July 1942 and Hockering (2 Group) in January 1943 some five months late. When the USAAF arrived new Forward Ammunition Supply depots were built for its needs at sites including Braybrooke (Northamptonshire), Bures (Suffolk), Melchbourne Park and Sharnbrook (both in Bedfordshire). Where it was rational the USAAF was given sub-sites at existing depots as well. After the outbreak of hostilities the demands on the Air Ammunition Parks grew far beyond the planned limits. Total site limits were raised from 1,000 tons to 10,000 tons, and the individual stores designed to hold 56 tons of bombs were each, by 1943, holding some 600 tons of matériel. When the parks were renamed Forward Ammunition Depots in 1941 they became central depots with a number of nearby satellite sites, Advanced Ammunition Parks, to increase holding capacity further. Staple Halt became an Advanced Ammunition Park. The two wartime Forward Ammunition Depots were markedly different from the pre-war designs, relying on concealment by woodland (South Witham was actually within Morkery Woods) rather than toughness. The munitions were held in standard Nissen huts dispersed to increase safety, with transport on standard nine-foot metalled roads. Each had a stated capacity of 8,400 tons of bombs, 840 tons of incendiaries and for small arms ammunition. Satellite sites Six Tallboy bombs in a bomb dump at Bardney, Lincolnshire prior to being loaded on No. 9 Squadron RAF aircraft in October or November 1944 The underground depots also gained satellite sites. Chilmark, which as the most southerly store had been often targeted by the Luftwaffe, gained a surface presence of over thirty buildings as well as control over extensive semi-underground sub-sites at Dinton and Groveley Wood, with smaller sub-sites at Hawkinge, Redbrook/Newland, Ruislip and RAF Worthy Down. Fauld had sub-sites at Bagot's Wood, Flax Mill and nearby Hilton; the main site was also expanded. The depots were in danger of obsolescence for two main reasons. During the war, RAF bombs became much larger: quickly became the new large bomb and the vast production of the older and devices was assigned to long-term storage. This meant the depots had little space to store new, bigger bombs, nor had they the equipment, training or ability to handle larger bombs safely. Secondly, the bases had been located on the assumption that the majority of fighting would be in support of France with active units in the south and east, together with support and training units in the south-west and west. There was no thought that France would collapse in early 1940. The new requirements for RAF fighter and bomber operations from the south-west needed a matching supply structure, which had not been built. As an example of the pace of change, the 1936 estimate of 98,000 tonnes can be compared to an October 1941 estimated requirement of 632,000 tons within the following year. In 1941 the RAF had a total storage capacity of 158,000 tons. This inadequate capacity was reduced after the depot at Llanberis partially collapsed on 25 January 1942 and the Harpur Hill depot was closed soon afterwards as a precaution against a similar structural failure. A total of 23,906 tons of matériel was removed from these two sites by May 1942. Llanberis was effectively abandoned (decommissioned in 1956, the site would cause problems later when, in 1969, it was discovered that terrorists were exploring the site for explosives) but Harpur Hill was reinforced and re-opened, although the storage of potentially sensitive explosives was prohibited. There was a hurried examination of even more marginal storage sites, but the situation was overtaken by events. By early 1942 German raids were markedly less threatening than anticipated, thus the need for the additional protection of underground storage was no longer paramount, indeed the sites came to be regarded as expensive white elephants. The method of supply of ammunition was soon changed, with supplies moving directly from the factories to the Forward Ammunition Depots, cutting the underground stores out of the system and relegating them to stores for obsolete stock and chemical weapons, holding points for very large cargoes, and repair centres. Three large new surface sites were established at Gisburn and Wortley in Yorkshire, and Longparish/Harewood Forest in Hampshire. Longparish was designed to hold 40,000 tons of ammunition and the other sites 25,000 tons each. The collapse of Llanberis also led to the decision to remove chemical weapons from subterranean storage; these were mainly a large number of bombs containing the unstable and corrosive mustard gas. Harpur Hill had been designated the central store for such devices in April 1940, receiving its first load in June of that year of mustard gas bombs evacuated from France. In June 1942 it was decided to move the bombs to a remote site at Bowes Moor in County Durham, beginning in December 1941 with the bombs initially stored in the open under tarpaulins or in wooden sheds. It was found that the sheep on the moorland would consume the tarpaulins and disturb the bombs, resulting in the addition of sheep-proof fences and gates for the entire site. Fifty new buildings were later added to store the larger bombs. To ease distribution of mustard gas, five Forward Filling Stations were built at or near existing bomb storage sites. Another blow to the underground stores came on 27 November 1944 when there was an explosion at Fauld involving approximately 4,000 tons of high explosive bombs, killing seventy people. The Court of Enquiry concluded that the explosion had been initiated by a mistake in the handling of a damaged bomb by RAF personnel. Post World War II ammunition disposal At the end of the war there was, naturally, a sudden and enormous surplus of ammunition. There was little storage difficulty; with no prospect of air attack many of the newly abandoned airfields were turned into open stores for this ammunition prior to its disposal. Many chemical weapons were disposed of in situ at Maintenance Units but Bowes Moor and Harpur Hill became the centres for destruction.Dangerous Stuff by Graham Crisp Bulk mustard gas was graded and shipped to Rhydymwyn where any sub-standard product was loaded into 52 gallon drums and dumped either in the Hurd Deep or in Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea.C&M; 1-77 Works Managers Minutes 1945-57 held at DEFRA Records,Alnwick Almost 71,000 bombs containing tabun had been seized in Germany; these were stored in the open at RAF Llandwrog, near Caernarfon, until 1955/56 when, in Operation Sandcastle, they were transported to Cairnryan and scuttled at sea in three ships north-west of Ireland.Sloan, Roy (1998).

It is named after the Luleå University of Technology, the home institute/university of the technique's authors. The name of the algorithm does not appear in the original paper describing it, but was used in a message from Craig Partridge to the Internet Engineering Task Force describing that paper prior to its publication.\\"second Europe trip for IETFers...\\", Craig Partridge to IETF, May 1, 1997. The key task to be performed in internet routing is to match a given IPv4 address (viewed as a sequence of 32 bits) to the longest prefix of the address for which routing information is available. This prefix matching problem may be solved by a trie, but trie structures use a significant amount of space (a node for each bit of each address) and searching them requires traversing a sequence of nodes with length proportional to the number of bits in the address. The Luleå algorithm shortcuts this process by storing only the nodes at three levels of the trie structure, rather than storing the entire trie. Before building the Luleå trie, the routing table entries need to be preprocessed. Any bigger prefix that overlaps a smaller prefix must be repeatedly split into smaller prefixes, and only the split prefixes which does not overlap the smaller prefix is kept. It is also required that the prefix tree is complete. If there is not routing table entries for the entire address space, it must be completed by adding dummy entries, which only carries the information that no route is present for that range. This enables the simplified lookup in the Luleå trie (). The main advantage of the Luleå algorithm for the routing task is that it uses very little memory, averaging 4–5 bytes per entry for large routing tables. This small memory footprint often allows the entire data structure to fit into the routing processor's cache, speeding operations. However, it has the disadvantage that it cannot be modified easily: small changes to the routing table may require most or all of the data structure to be reconstructed. A modern home-computer (PC) has enough hardware/memory to perform the algorithm. The Luleå algorithm is patented in the United States (). First level The first level of the data structure consists of * A bit vector consisting of 216 = 65,536 bits, with one entry for each 16-bit prefix of an IPv4 address. A bit in this table is set to one if there is routing information associated with that prefix or with a longer sequence beginning with that prefix, or if the given prefix is the first one associated with routing information at some higher level of the trie; otherwise it is set to zero. * An array of 16-bit words for each nonzero bit in the bit vector. Each datum either supplies an index that points to the second-level data structure object for the corresponding prefix, or supplies the routing information for that prefix directly. * An array of \\"base indexes\\", one for each consecutive subsequence of 64 bits in the bit vector, pointing to the first datum associated with a nonzero bit in that subsequence. * An array of \\"code words\\", one for each consecutive subsequence of 16 bits in the bit vector. Each code word is 16 bits, and consists of a 10-bit \\"value\\" and a 6-bit \\"offset\\". The sum of the offset and the associated base index gives a pointer to the first datum associated with a nonzero bit in the given 16-bit subsequence. The 10-bit value gives an index into a \\"maptable\\" from which the precise position of the appropriate datum can be found. * A maptable. Because the prefix tree is required to be complete, there can only exist a limited amount of possible 16-bit bitmask values in the bit vector, 678. The maptable rows correspond to these 678 16-bit combinations, and columns the number of set bits in the bitmask at the bit location corresponding to the column, minus 1. So column 6 for the bitmask 1010101010101010 would have the value 2. The maptable is constant for any routing table contents. To look up the datum for a given address x in the first level of the data structure, the Luleå algorithm computes three values: #the base index at the position in the base index array indexed by the first 10 bits of x #the offset at the position in the code word array indexed by the first 12 bits of x #the value in maptable[y][z], where y is the maptable index from the code word array and z is bits 13–16 of x The sum of these three values provides the index to use for x in the array of items. Second and third levels The second and third levels of the data structure are structured similarly to each other; in each of these levels the Luleå algorithm must perform prefix matching on 8-bit quantities (bits 17–24 and 25–32 of the address, respectively). The data structure is structured in \\"chunks\\", each of which allows performing this prefix matching task on some subsequence of the address space; the data items from the first level data structure point to these chunks. If there are few enough different pieces of routing information associated with a chunk, the chunk just stores the list of these routes, and searches through them by a single step of binary search followed by a sequential search. Otherwise, an indexing technique analogous to that of the first level is applied. Notes References *. *. *. *.

The prologue states that the tract was submitted to the Jade Emperor or Highest God by the king of hell Yan Luo and the Bodhisattva of Compassion, then passed down to a Buddhist priest and on to a Taoist, during the Song Dynasty. The tract describes how the dead pass through the ten courts of hell and are punished with terrible torture according to their misdeeds during life. In the first hall, the \\"Mirror of Reflection\\" lets the dead see their own sins. Sins specifically mentioned include: mocking or disbelieving the tract itself, taking one's life without good reason, having weak faith in the Buddha, being careless as Buddhist or Taoist priest, killing live creatures, stealing, cheating, gambling, drinking, drowning baby girls, killing slaves etc. Yan Luo himself rules over the fifth court of hell; the Highest God demoted him from the first court because he proved too compassionate towards murder victims, allowing them to return to the world for another life. Yan Luo also built a \\"Tower to View the World\\", from which the dead can observe how their relatives curse their memory and fight over their possessions. At the end of their passage through hell, the souls are made to forget their previous lives in the goddess Meng's \\"Tower of Forgetting\\" and are sent back to the world, reincarnated as animals, poor, ill or ugly humans, or as rich men, depending on their prior behavior.Jonathan D.

The Sakyamuni Buddha, the Boddhisattva of Compassion, and the Kitchen God receive two days each. Numerous other gods also receive their special day. Sinners are being tortured in the sixth court of hell by hammering metal spikes into the body; skinnig alive; sawing body in half; and having to kneel on metal filings. The Qing emperors tried to suppress the tracts, as the state religion Confucianism discouraged any speculation about the afterlife.

The bulk of these games were for Worcestershire and Oxford University, though he also appeared once for Harlequins. In minor cricket, he played for both Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements, where he was working as a doctor. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1973. History Hopkins was born in South Australia, a son of Herbert Horatio Oxley Hopkins (c. 1859 – 2 April 1944) and his wife Fanny Hopkins née Newland (23 July 1867 – 20 May 1920). Fanny was a granddaughter of Rev. Ridgway William Newland and a cousin of Henry Simpson Newland. His father was an employee of the National Bank of Australasia at Eudunda, later at Woodville and Grange, and was captain of district cricket clubs in these locations. Young Hopkins was educated at St Peter's College in Adelaide before going to Oxford. His studies were interrupted by The Great War, when he volunteered with 7 Battalion, Liverpool regiment, was injured and repatriated to Australia. After the war he returned to Oxford, studying medicine at Magdalen College. He married Dr. (Margaret) Elinor Jones of Tunbridge Wells around 1927; they had two children. The couple were involved with malaria research in Malaya, and were in Singapore at the time of the Japanese takeover of the island, and were held at Sime Road internment camp for the duration of the war. Cricketing career Hopkins played for St. Margaret's (Anglican, Woodville) church team and Woodville Cricket Club before leaving Australia. He made his first-class debut for the Oxford University against Free Foresters at The University Parks in June 1921. He scored 7 and 32 in a game which ended in a Free Foresters win despite an innings of 202 from Oxford captain R.L. Holdsworth. After three more university games Hopkins played the rest of the summer for Worcestershire, though his only substantial score was an unbeaten 60 against Lancashire in August. During 1922 and 1923, Hopkins divided his playing time between his university and his county. In June 1922, in a 15-run win for Oxford over the Army at Oxford, he scored what was to remain his career-best innings of 142*, though he made only one other half-century that season. In early July 1923 he hit 100* for Oxford against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, and won his Blue when he appeared in the Varsity Match at the same venue a few days later, making 42 in a crushing innings-and-227-run triumph over Cambridge University. He ended 1923 with 729 first-class runs at 27.00, by some way his highest season's aggregate. That marked the end of Hopkins' university cricket career, but he continued to appear, albeit somewhat irregularly, for Worcestershire over the next four seasons. In late June 1924, he scored 137 in a losing cause against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, and in the same match picked up three of the only four wickets he ever took: those of John Gunn, Len Richmond and Fred Barratt. (His other wicket, claimed earlier that same summer, had been that of Glamorgan's Jack Mercer. ) Hopkins scored just one more century — 122 against his old university in 1925 — although he got a start in a large number of innings without pushing on to fifties or hundreds. After the 1927 season, Hopkins ceased to play English cricket because of his work as a doctor in the Malay States, although he played minor cricket for Straits Settlements as late as 1938, by which time he was well into his forties. The exception was 1931, when he turned out nine times for Worcestershire in the County Championship during a period of leave. Hopkins acted once as wicket-keeper, for Worcestershire against Gloucestershire at Clifton College in 1921. His uncle, Bert Hopkins, played 20 Tests for Australia; while another uncle, Cyril Hopkins, had nine games for Otago.

It is an erect, woody shrub with glabrous branchlets, simple, egg-shaped leaves with fine teeth on the edges, and bright pink, four-petalled flowers on the ends of the branchlets.Illustration by Edward Minchen Description Boronia serrulata is an erect, woody shrub that typically grows to a height of about and has mostly glabrous branchlets. The leaves are crowded, simple, broadly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide and sessile. Both sides of the leaf are the same colour and the edges have fine teeth. Up to seven cup-shaped flowers are arranged on the ends of the branchlets on a peduncle up to long, the individual flowers either sessile or on a pedicel up to long. The four sepals are triangular, long and about wide and the four petals are bright pink, long. The eight stamens have a dense tuft of hairs near the tip. The style is hidden by a greatly enlarged stigma. Flowering occurs from August to November and the fruit is a mostly glabrous capsule about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia serrulata was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith who published the description in his book 'Tracts relating to natural history. The specific epithet (serrulata) is derived from the diminutive form of the Latin word serra meaning \\"saw\\", referring to the fine teeth on the edge of the leaves. Distribution and habitat Native rose grows in sandy soil in moist heath, mainly in near-coastal parts of the Sydney basin. Use in horticulture This boronia is described as an attractive shrub with bright green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It is most easily grown from semi-hardwood cuttings taken in early summer and the plant grows best in well-drained soil with a cool root run.Boronia serrulata - Stuart Donaldson (1981), Growing Native Plants, Australian National Botanic Gardens  References  serrulata Flora of New South Wales Plants described in 1798 Taxa named by James Edward Smith ","title":"Boronia serrulata"},{"id":"13284648","text":"Drop To His Death (also published under the title Fatal Descent) is a mystery novel by the American writer John Dickson Carr, who published it under the name of Carter Dickson, in collaboration with John Rhode.

As of 2000, its population numbered 213. Bryn Mawr is bordered on the east by Redlands. History Originally named Nahant in the 1880s, the community was renamed Redlands Junction after a Southern Pacific Railroad depot was built in the town, accompanying the railroad through nearby San Timoteo Canyon. To avoid being confused with nearby Redlands, the name was replaced with Bryn Mawr, and the depot added a post office in 1895. In the 1900s, the town was prosperous along with the local citrus industry, and four packing houses were built in the area. Before 1902, when the first packing house was built, the rail depot was used to pack citrus. Local amenities included a general store, blacksmith's shop, pool room, service station, market, restaurant and workers' cabins. The town slowly blended into nearby cities after the citrus industry was no longer an economic force in the area; a post office built in 1971 remains but the train depot was demolished. Parts of the town were incorporated into the city of Loma Linda when it incorporated in 1970, and the remaining area was controversially annexed by the city in 2008 at the suggestion of the county's Local Agency Formation Commission. The area is now mostly a suburban residential neighborhood. Landmarks San Timoteo Creek flows through the community, and San Timoteo Canyon is nearby. Bryn Mawr Elementary School, the Loma Linda Broadcasting Network, and a historic Native American mission school and former Catholic church (now the Loma Linda Romanian Seventh-day Adventist Church) are located in the community, and Barton Villa in neighboring Redlands is just east of the area. Two parks are located in the neighborhood: Leonard Bailey Park, named after the heart surgeon who operated on Baby Fae at the nearby Loma Linda University Medical Center, and Bryn Mawr Veterans' Memorial Park, built by the city of Loma Linda after the 2008 annexation in order to mollify local residents.

Early life  Campbell was born on June 30, 1889 in Winfield, Kansas. Her grandmother, Eliza Butler, was an ex-slave. Education Campbell was the only black student enrolled in Montrose High School (Montrose, Colorado) when she delivered the valedictorian address to the class of 1908. Upon graduation Campbell was offered a four-year scholarship to Colorado College. Campbell declined the scholarship and chose instead to enroll in Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1908 where she received financial support from the Congregational Church. In 1913 she co-founded Delta Sigma Theta and took part in a women's suffrage march in Washington, D.C. In June of that year she graduated cum laude from Howard University with a bachelor of arts degree in education. She then taught for two years in Topeka.  Family  She married Earl Pitts, a railroad worker and later government worker, in 1917. The couple spent some time in Colorado, then moved to Seattle in 1923. Earl died of a heart attack in 1954.  Activism and Later Years  In Seattle, Campbell was a committed activist and organizer. She was a charter member of the Christian Friends for Racial Equality, an organization which worked to expand housing and other opportunities for the black community; she worked with the Seattle Urban League; and was the first black member of the board of directors of the YWCA of Seattle-King County. She was an active member of the YWCA for 53 years. At age 92, Campbell led 10,000 members of her Delta Sigma Theta sorority in a march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. to commemorate the participation of the organization in the suffrage march of 1913. Having long survived her husband and son, she spent her final years in a Seattle nursing home and died peacefully at age 100. In 2018 and 2019, the Northwest African American Museum featured an exhibition on Campbell and Mona Humphries Bailey, the 17th president of Delta Sigma Theta.

It is one of the oldest Prussian aristocratic families extant, dating back to the 12th century in the Duchy of Carinthia.  Origins  Finkenstein Castle, Carinthia According to the Prussian State Archive Königsberg, the first representative of the family appeared authentically with one 'Niche of Roghusen' in 1388 in Roggenhausen in the State of the Teutonic Order. However, his allocation is uncertain; under its current name, the house appears authentically in 1451 with 'Michael Fincke' who calls himself 'Finck von Roggenhausen' in 1474. The family was raised to Imperial Counts (Reichsgrafen) and Counts (Grafen) in Prussia as 'Finck von Finckenstein' in 1710. The Finck von Finckenstein's Imperial Count Diploma of 1710 determines as the cradle of the house of Finck von Finckenstein the today dilapidated Finkenstein Castle ruin in Carinthia. Hereafter the house appears for the first time 1143 with Gotwold von Finkenstein, Master of Finkenstein in Carinthia. The Carinthian branch of the Finckensteins died in the 14th century, a junior branch, however, joined the Order of St John and after possibly participating in the Third Crusade conquered Old Prussia and Christianised the Old Prussians. According to the Imperial Count Diploma Konrad Finck von Finckenstein came during the Prussian Crusade in the 13th century with his 100 knights of the Order of St John in its drive to conquer Old Prussia alongside the Teutonic Knights.

However, the site is actually the promontory tombolo on the northeastern shore, near modern Gölyazı. The remains of Apollonia are inconsiderable. The Rhyndacus flows into the lake and issues from it a deep and muddy river. The lake extends from east to west and is studded with several islands in the northeast part, on one of which is Gölyazı, but the dimensions vary greatly through the seasons.

The name of “Apollonia ad Rhyndacum” was chosen in order to differentiate from other cities in the Ancient Era with reference to the stream “Rhyndacus (Adranos)” located close to the city and stemming from Aizanoi (Çavdarhisar).

Personal life Torres was married to Maria in 1938. They had one daughter, Helen, born in December 1939. They also had a son, Enrique (Tony), born in November 1940. Later Torres married Rachel in 1950. They had two sons; Allan Enrique, born April 1952, and Jim (James), born June 1956. Enrique married Kata in 1963; Kata and he later moved to Canada ultimately to reside in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, they had forty- four wonderful years together. In his later years Enrique was on kidney dialysis in addition to receiving a kidney transplant in 2006, then suffered a stroke. On September 10, 2007 he died as a resident of the Carewest George Boyack Nursing Home in Calgary. Professional wrestling career Torres was born in Santa Ana, California and after a long amateur career entered professional wrestling in 1946 debuting at the Olympic Auditorium and was very successful in the nascent and booming televised wrestling market in the California. He had no gimmicks, however his signature move was a deftly executed Flying Scissors. He used no self given stage name but a Mexican- market newspaper billed him as “La Pantera Negro de Sonora”, or \\"The Black Panther from Sonora, Mexico,\\" due to his \\"smooth and lightning-fast moves.\\" He would later be named \\"The Mexican Adonis.\\" In his first year, he won the California version of the world heavyweight championship before losing it Gorgeous George, only to win it back the following year. In 1952 Torres and then-rival Baron Leone were involved in a case that went all the way to the Santa Monica Superior Court due to two fans claiming they were injured when Leone threw Torres into the crowd. Leone claimed if he was capable of the feat he'd leave wrestling to play for the Southern Cal football team, and the two were exonerated. One of Torres' greatest matches was in February 1953 while he was the reigning Pacific Coast Heavy Weight champion, he wrestled the legendary world heavyweight champion Lou Thesz to a one-hour draw. The gate was a then-record $5000 in Sacramento. He also claimed the Central States championship in 1952 and 1963. Due to his success Torres' brothers Alberto and Ramon wanted to join him in wrestling. Enrique worked with Alberto and Ramon; Rachel, Enrique’s second wife, worked to help train Ramon in the various wrestling holds and tactics. In time, with hard work and training in Oakland, CA they received Enrique's blessing and later went on the road. The three went on to be involved in a 'Vachon-Torres Brother War' in Georgia against the Vachon wrestling family. In 1971 Alberto would be the first to die, as a result of a ruptured pancreas from a match in the ring. Ramon would later die August 2000 of heart failure. In addition to his singles titles, Torres also held numerous tag team championships teamed with Bobo Brazil, Leo Nomellini, Ronnie Etchison, Johnny Barend, Jess Ortega, and his brothers in the 1950s and 1960s, ranging from Texas to the Central States territory. Enrique and Alberto wrestled a headliner match in Havana, Cuba the night that the Batista regime fell to Castro’s rebel army in 1959 and returned to the US with the help of his Promoter, Benny Ginsberg and his Meyer Lansky connections in Cuba. Enrique retired in 1968 after one last run as a headline star, living in California Hawaii and Nevada. In 1969 Enrique was asked to make a cameo appearance by Jimmy Lennon, a much loved sports announcer at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles for a celebration of twenty-five years of televised wrestling. Enrique later moved with his third wife Kata Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In 2006, a Japanese reporter visited Calgary, Canada to meet and interview Enrique one last time. Enrique remains highly respected and revered as part of the Japan Wrestling Association where he wrestled the Japanese Sumobasho circuit in the 1960s. His success came for his skills, talent, good looks and a convergence of technology and the need for television content in what would later become a $Multi-Billion market. Those were the days of real wrestling. He used to say, \\"that these cauliflower ears didn't come from sleeping on hard hotel pillows, as well as his knee, back and other injuries sustained in the arena ring. It was called the arena, as a left over from the days of gladiatorial combat, arena means \\"the sand\\" in Latin. Enrique Torres - in 2010, voted into the Wrestling-Hall-of-Fame by a special committee that looked at pre-1980 wrestlers, Enrique Torres was one of the biggest stars in Southern California in the 1940s and 1950s. Enrique held the Los Angeles version of the World Title almost nonstop between 1946 and 1950. During that time he had two of the biggest feuds of the era with Gorgeos George and later Baron Michele Leone. He retired from wrestling in 1968 and died in 2007 at the age of 85.

TOC History The club was founded in 1923 as Turn- und Sportverein Lurup in the former town Lurup and later that same year merged with FSV 1920 Schenefeld to form TSV Lurup-Schenefeld in a union that lasted until 1930 when the two clubs went their separate ways. Both sides were workers' sports clubs which were regarded as too left leaning and politically undesirable by the Nazis. They were among numerous similar associations disbanded by the regime in 1933. The former membership of FSV was re-organized as Fußball Club Blau-Weiß 1933 Schenefeld and included the football department of TSV Lurup. On 17 July 1936 FC was in turn merged with Spielvereinigung Blau-Weiß 1896 Schenefeld to play as TuRa Blau-Weiß 1896 in Schenefeld und Osdorf/Nord. Following World War II occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of most organizations in the country, including sports and football associations. TSV 1923 Lurup was re-established in 1946, becoming SV Lurup in 1949, and SV Lurup-Hamburg in 1978. Throughout its existence to this point Lurup had played as an anonymous local side. At the time of the 1963 formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's first top-flight profession league, the club was playing in the Landesliga Hamburg (V). In the mid-70s shipping company Stauerei Tiedemann came on as the major sponsor of the club and SV's fortunes soon improved. A division title led to the Verbandsliga Hamburg (IV) in 1975, and a second-place finish there in 1978 saw the team's first participation in the promotion round for the Oberliga Nord (III). They were unable to advance and sponsor Tiedemann withdrew to be replaced by local construction firm owner Uwe Einsath. A Verbandsliga championship and successful promotion playoff in 1981 put the team into third tier competition. The club's first turn in the Oberliga was short-lived, but they immediately re-bounded with a second Verbandsliga title and playoff win in 1983. Lurup then enjoyed its best ever season, finishing third in the Oberliga Nord (III). The second team side of Werder Bremen captured the division that year, but were ineligible to move up. Lurup subsequently took part in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga alongside second-place finisher FC St. Pauli, but performed poorly. A dispute within the club over the move into professional football soon led to withdrawal of Einsath as sponsor and by 1987 Lurup slipped to fifth tier Landesliga play. With Einsath's later return as sponsor the club recovered itself and by 1992 was again playing third division football in the Amateur Oberliga Nord. League reorganization saw SV into the Regionalliga Nord (III) in 1994 where they would remain until relegated in 1997. The team was unable to attain Einsath's dream of reaching second division competition and he reduced his level of support to the club which fell to fourth division play in the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein in 1997. Since Oktober 2001 the club is deeply involved in the life of the Lurup quarter by training the young or lenting out sports equipment free of charge. Lurup narrowly avoided relegation to the Verbandsliga Hamburg (V) in 2001 when several clubs that finished ahead of them in the division withdrew from play. However, the merger of the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (IV) and the Oberliga Bremen/Niedersachsen (IV) to create the Oberliga Nord (IV) saw the club slip to the Verbandsliga in 2004. Their recent return to Oberliga play came despite a sixth-place result and accompanying negative goal difference in 2007, as the other clubs that finished ahead of Lurup each declined the opportunity to advance. In recent seasons the club has been fluctuating between the Oberliga Hamburg and the Landesliga below it, playing in the latter again from 2013 to 2015, when the club was promoted back to the Oberliga on winning its second Landesliga Hammonia title after 40 years. The 2015–16 season proofed dexterous for the club, coming last, losing 33 of 34 season games and being relegated. They have also lost 27 of their 28 games in a lower division in the 2016/17 season, picking up just 3 points.

Biography Henry was born in Thames in 1902, and was the son of John and Edith Henry. He was the eldest of the three sons who include Jack Henry and Clive Henry. He studied law at Auckland University College before being admitted as a barrister in 1925. He was one of the founding partners of the Auckland law firm, Wilson Henry (now Hesketh Henry), and was involved in several high-profile cases during the 1930s, including the murder trial of Eric Mareo and Dove-Myer Robinson's landmark lawsuit to prevent the Auckland Drainage Board discharging sewage in Auckland Harbour. Henry was raised to the bench of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1955, the same year that his son, John Henry was raised to the bar. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1970 New Year Honours for his services to the New Zealand justice system. In 1984, Sir Trevor and John made New Zealand legal history as the first father and son to sit together on a High Court bench in New Zealand. Sir Trevor was also a Justice of the Fijian Court of Appeal and served a term as the Chief Justice of Tonga. Henry continued his family's long history of community involvement, sitting on the 1936 New Zealand Olympic Games selection committee, serving three terms on the New Zealand Parole Board and chairing the New Zealand War Pensions Appeal Board. Henry's career was described as \\"meteoric.\\" His inauguration ceremony at the Supreme Court in 1955 saw one of the largest-ever turnouts of Auckland society and Sir George Finlay remarked that Henry possessed a \\"wiseness, a sense of duty and an experience of men and affairs which should light his path to the end that justice should truly be done.\\" Sir Duncan McMullin described Henry as a humble man, devoid of pretence, with a meticulous approach to surveying evidence and a sharp mind to analyse issues at the heart of any case. He remained active in New Zealand law well into his 90s, offering opinions and publishing articles on a range of legally related subjects. Following Henry's death in 2007 at the age of 105, the New Zealand Herald published allegations that he had secretly fathered two children with a young Māori woman from Te Arawa in the 1920s.

The name is also used to refer to the square in front of the church. The Pátio do Colégio marks the site where the city was founded in 1554.Colonial history in the São Paulo State official website The city of São Paulo has its beginnings in a mission established by Jesuits Manuel da Nóbrega, José de Anchieta and others in the Brazilian hinterland. The village - then called São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga - was founded on a plateau between two rivers, the Tamanduateí and the Anhangabaú, and was linked to the coastal village of São Vicente by a precarious path in the rainforest. The date that marks the beginning of São Paulo is January 25, 1554, when the priests celebrated the inaugural mass of the Jesuit school. Initially, the church building was a modest hut covered with palm leaves or straw. In 1556, under father Afonso Brás, new buildings of the school and church were finished using taipa de pilão (rammed earth), a more solid technique. These buildings would be the centre of spiritual and educational life in the settlement in the next couple of centuries. Since its beginnings, the Jesuit action in evangelising the Amerinds clashed with the interests of many settlers, who used indigenous slave labour and profited from the indigenous slave trade. In the early São Paulo, the expeditions of the bandeirantes to the hinterland in order to capture Amerinds were an important economic activity, and the conflicts with the Jesuits led to the expulsion of the Order from the village in 1640. Only in 1653, bandeirante Fernão Dias Pais Leme allowed the return of the Jesuit priests. The church and school were extensively rebuilt around 1653. In 1759, with the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in Portugal and its colonies ordered by the Marquis of Pombal, the fathers had to leave again. The Jesuit buildings now housed the colonial governors of São Paulo, and they continued to serve administrative functions after the Independence of Brazil and well into the 20th century. The colonial structures were completely rebuilt in different styles, and in 1896 the church collapsed. The tower survived but was greatly modified. In 1953, during the celebrations of the city's 400th anniversary, the area was given back to the Jesuit order. Thanks to their relative simple architecture and the abundance of 19th-century iconography, the church was rebuilt and the tower and the school façade were given back their colonial look. The church and tower, in particular, have the sober Mannerist style they had in the 17th century, typical of Jesuit churches of colonial Brazil. Anchieta Museum Pátio do Colégio In 1979, a museum dedicated to Father José de Anchieta was inaugurated in the Pátio do Colégio. It contains more the 600 items including colonial paintings, altarpieces and sculptures, documents and iconography pertaining Jesuit action in Brazil. 17th century portraits of José de Anchieta and writer and priest António Vieira, another important Jesuit figure, are highlights of the collection. Particularly informative is also a scale model of the Pátio do Colégio area at the time of the founding of São Paulo and the panels that show the development of this area of the city through the centuries.

Biography =Early life= Bedford was born in Hunslet, a suburb of Leeds, Yorkshire, England, in 1877. Alongside his four sisters and together with their mother, they emigrated to Invercargill in 1886 to reunite with his father. He received further education at Clifton School and left after Standard 6 (year 8) to work for his father's tailoring business. He later became a professor of history and economics at the University of Otago in Dunedin. He married Ella Brown in 1907. One of their four children, John Dodgshun Bedford (born 1916), was the father of the human geographer Richard Bedford. =Member of Parliament= Harry Bedford represented one of the multi-member City of Dunedin seats in the New Zealand Parliament from 1902 to 1905. Bedford was an Independent Liberal in 1902 topped the poll for Dunedin City with 10,088 votes. He became the sensation of the 1902 election: a political novice who had obtained the highest individual vote ever recorded in New Zealand. The Lyttelton Times described him as \\"the 'idol of Dunedin' ... young, good-looking, able, earnest, energetic and highly attractive as a speaker\\". In , Bedford stood for the new seat of Dunedin North but was not successful. He contested Dunedin West in as an Independent polling 3,635 votes to 778 votes for Jim Munro. The seat was held by John Millar on the second ballot. Harry Bedford joined the United Labour Party in 1912. =Death= Bedford drowned while swimming at Whangarei on 17 February 1918.

They are regularly replaced through desquamation and renewal from lower epidermal layers, making them an essential part of the skin barrier property.  Structure  Corneocytes are keratinocytes without nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. They contain a highly insoluble cornified envelope within the plasma membrane, and lipids (fatty acids, sterols and ceramides) released from lamellar bodies within the epidermis. The corneocytes are interlocked with each other and organized as vertical columns of 10–30 cells to form the stratum corneum. Corneocytes in the lower part of the stratum corneum are bridged together through specialized junctions (corneodesmosomes). Those junctions disintegrate as corneocytes migrate toward the surface of the skin and result in desquamation. At the same time, as those loosened junctions encounter more hydration, they will expand and connect together, forming potential entry pores for microorganisms. The stratum corneum can absorb three times its weight in water but if its water content drops below 10% it no longer remains pliable and cracks. Formation Corneocytes are keratinocytes in their last stage of differentiation. Keratinocytes in the stratum basale of the epidermis will multiply through cell division and migrate toward the skin surface. During that migration keratinocytes will undergo multiple stages of differentiation to finally become corneocytes once they reach the stratum corneum. As corneocytes are continually eliminated through desquamation or through rubbing, skin washing or detergents they are also continually formed through keratinocyte differentiation. Corneocytes, also referred to as squames (from Latin squama, meaning a “thin flake” or “scales”) are terminally differentiated, anucleated cells of keratinocyte lineage that constitute the majority of stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. Size of a corneocyte is approximately 30-50 µm in diameter and 1 µm thick, and the average area of corneocytes at the surface of the skin reaches approximately 1000 µm2, but may vary according to anatomical location, age and external environmental conditions such as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Major constituents of corneocytes are keratin intermediate filaments organized in parallel bundles to form a matrix to give rigidity to the overall structure of the skin. Functions Layers of corneocytes produce high mechanical strength which allows epidermis of the skin to perform its function as a physical, chemical and immunological barrier. For example, corneocytes act as UV barrier by reflecting the scattered UV radiation, protecting cells inside the body from apoptosis and DNA damage. As corneocytes are essentially dead cells, they are not prone to viral attacks, though invisible microabrasions may cause permeability. Colonization of pathogens in the skin is prevented via complete turnovers of corneocyte layer every 2–4 weeks. Corneocytes are also capable of absorbing and storing small amounts of water to keep the skin hydrated and maintain its flexibility. Intracellular structures Natural moisturizing factor Corneocytes contain small molecules called natural moisturizing factors, which absorb small amounts of water into the corneocytes thereby hydrating the skin. The natural moisturizing factor is a collection of water- soluble compounds produced from the degradation of histidine-rich proteins called filaggrin, which are responsible for aggregating keratin filaments to form keratin bundles that maintain the rigid structure of the cells in stratum corneum. When filaggrin is degraded, urea, pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (1,2), glutamic acid and other amino acids are produced. These are collectively referred to as the ‘natural moisturizing factor’ of the skin. The components of the natural moisturizing factor absorb water from the atmosphere to ensure that the superficial layers of the stratum corneum stay hydrated. As they are water-soluble themselves, excessive water contact may leach them and inhibit their normal functions which is why prolonged contact with water makes the skin drier. The intercellular lipid layer helps prevent the loss of natural moisturizing factor by sealing the outside of each corneocyte. Extracellular structures Although stratum corneum is mostly composed of corneocytes, other supporting structures are present in the extracellular matrix to assist in the function of stratum corneum. These include: *Lamellar bodies *Intercellular lipids (lamellar lipid bilayer) *Cornified envelope *Corneodesmosomes Lamellar bodies Lamellar bodies are tubular or ovoid-shaped secretory organelles derived from the Golgi apparatus of keratinocytes in the upper part of stratum spinosum. From the site of production, lamellar bodies migrate to the top of the stratum granulosum and then into the intercellular domain of the stratum corneum to extrude their contents, which are predominantly lipids. The lipids ultimately form the lamellar lipid bilayer that surrounds corneocytes and also contribute to permeability barrier homeostasis of the stratum corneum. The homeostasis function is regulated by the calcium gradient in the epidermis. Usually the calcium level is very low in stratum corneum, but high in stratum granulosum. Once the permeability barrier is disrupted an influx of water occurs in the stratum corneum, which in turn increases the calcium levels in the stratum corneum but decreases it in the stratum granulosum. This perturbation induces lamellar bodies to undergo exocytosis and secrete lipids such as glycosylceramides, cholesterol and phospholipids to retrieve the permeability barrier function of stratum corneum. Intercellular lipids (lamellar lipid bilayer) Corneocytes are embedded in a matrix of specialized lipids that constitute approximately 20% of the stratum corneum volume. The major constituents of the intercellular lipids in stratum corneum include ceramides (30-50% by mass), cholesterol (25% by mass) and free fatty acids (10-20% by mass), mostly produced by lamellar bodies. These hydrophobic components fuse together to form multiple bilayers of lipids between corneocytes to act as the principal barrier to the transcutaneous movement of water and electrolytes.  Cornified envelope  The cornified envelope is a protein shell that surrounds each corneocyte. Its thickness varies between 15 and 20 nm. The highly insoluble cornified envelope is formed by cross-linking of soluble precursor proteins such as loricrin, involucrin, envoplakin and periplakin. Corneodesmosomes and desquamation The overall integrity of the stratum corneum is maintained by specialized intercellular proteins called corneodesmosomes. Three adhesive proteins desmoglein-1, desmocollin-1 and corneodesmosin compose the corneodesmosomes and provide the cohesive forces to connect the adjacent corneocytes. The components of the corneodesmosomes are gradually degraded by the enzymes that digest proteins, as the corneocytes are pushed towards the surface of the skin. As a result of the weakened corneodesmosomes in the outer skin surface, the uppermost layers of corneocytes get exfoliated through frictional forces such as rubbing or washing. This process is a normal protective mechanism of the skin to prevent pathogens from colonizing the skin, and is referred to as desquamation. In healthy skin, desquamation is an invisible process and the stratum corneum is turned over completely within 2–4 weeks, while maintaining the tissue thickness. Pathologies Dry skin (xerosis) Dry skin (xerosis) involves increased thickness of stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis), which may occur due to various reasons including aging, humidity of the environment or UV irradiation. The accumulation of corneocyte clumps on the surface of the skin may lead to abnormal detachment of squames as visible clusters. Xerosis is common, especially in elderly individuals which may be due to decreased quantity of free amino acids, a constituent of natural moisturizing factor. Consequently, many moisturizers in the markets incorporate the components of the natural moisturizing factor as well as keratin and elastin. Localization Corneocytes are part of the stratum corneum of the epidermis and contribute the barrier function of the skin.

It is a whodunnit and features the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale. Plot summary Nine oddly-assorted passengers aboard the S.S. Edwardic are crossing the Atlantic during World War II, with the constant threat of attack by German submarines. When one passenger is murdered, apparently for a military secret, Sir Henry Merrivale must solve the mystery. But can he contend with the fact that the killer's fingerprint doesn't match anybody on the ship? Literary significance and criticism according to Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, the novel is:\\"One of the author's most straightforward stories. The action ... consists in finding out who murdered whom for a military secret -- except that the motive takes an unexpected turn. The several characters are well differentiated and suspicion fairly distributed. Shipboard life in the blackout is especially well done.\\"Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

The album contains 14 of the tongue-in-cheek pastiches of Beatles songs that were featured in the film. The primary creative force of the Rutles' music was Neil Innes, the sole composer and arranger of the songs. In the late 1960s, Innes had been the \\"seventh\\" member of Monty Python as well as one of the main artists behind the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, who had been featured in the real Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film performing \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\". Innes credits the three musicians he recruited to assist him on the project as having been important in helping him capture the feel of the Beatles. Guitarist/singer Ollie Halsall and drummer John Halsey had played together in the groups Timebox and Patto. Multi-instrumentalist Rikki Fataar had played with the Flames before joining the Beach Boys in the early 1970s. Eric Idle, who devised the Rutles concept and co-wrote the film, did not play or sing on any of the recordings; he offered to help, but had recently had an appendectomy, so he was encouraged to recuperate instead. George Harrison, having encouraged Idle and Innes to make a film that satirised the Beatles' history, and lent them archival footage for inclusion in the film, facilitated the album's release by introducing them to the chairman of Warner Bros. Records, Mo Ostin. The pastiches mimic the Beatles' sound to the degree that a 1978 Beatles bootleg, Indian Rope Trick, included the Rutles' \\"Cheese and Onions\\", attributing it to John Lennon. In the early 1980s, Innes was accused by one American Beatle fan of stealing unreleased Beatles tracks to use in the film; this was based on a recording of \\"Cheese and Onions\\" obtained by the fan which he believed to be by John Lennon. When the recording was played to Innes, he was amused to discover that it was actually his own demo of the song. Innes was taken to court by the owners of the Beatles' catalogue, alleging copyright infringement of their songs. Innes had to testify under oath that he had not listened to the songs at all while composing the Rutles' songs, but had created them completely originally based on what he remembered various Beatles songs sounding like at different times. Songs The album contains parodies of Beatles numbers such as \\"Ouch!\\" (\\"Help!\\"), \\"Hold My Hand\\" (\\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" \\"All My Loving,\\" \\"She Loves You,\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week\\"), \\"With a Girl Like You\\" (\\"If I Fell\\"), \\"Living in Hope\\" (\\"Don't Pass Me By\\"), \\"Love Life\\" (\\"All You Need is Love\\"), \\"Good Times Roll\\" (\\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"), \\"Nevertheless\\" (\\"Within You Without You\\", \\"The Inner Light\\"), \\"Let’s Be Natural\\" (\\"Julia,\\" \\"Dear Prudence\\"), \\"Another Day\\" (\\"Martha My Dear\\"), \\"Piggy in the Middle\\" (\\"I Am the Walrus\\") and \\"Doubleback Alley\\" (\\"Penny Lane\\"). The CD reissue includes \\"Blue Suede Schubert\\" (\\"Roll Over Beethoven\\"), \\"It's Looking Good\\" (\\"I'm Looking Through You\\") and \\"Between Us\\" (\\"If I Fell\\" again). \\"Get Up and Go\\" was not on the original LP – allegedly after Lennon warned Innes that it resembled \\"Get Back\\" much too closely and might prompt the music publisher, ATV Music, to sue – but was included on the CD reissue. All songs were written by Neil Innes. Despite having received Lennon's and Harrison's blessing for the project, however, he was forced by ATV Music to credit some of the songs to Lennon–McCartney–Innes. In 1996, Innes said of this stipulation: \\"George occasionally attempts to get the rights back for me, but it's not high up on anyone's agenda. I've stopped sulking about it.\\" The liner notes of the album give the names of the \\"Warner Brothers\\" as \\"Stan & Reg\\". The only song from the film not on the soundtrack is \\"You Need Feet\\", which is not a Rutles song. Originally released in 1958, it was written and performed by comedian Bernard Bresslaw and was a parody of the 1958 Max Bygraves hit \\"You Need Hands\\". Track listing = 1978 vinyl album = The original 1978 vinyl release of the soundtrack omitted some of the material. The design of the record's inner sleeve reflected the Apple/EMI 1962–1966 (\\"Red\\") and 1967–1970 (\\"Blue\\") compilation Beatles albums released in 1973, with printed lyrics, red, blue and white layouts, and the track listing for the two album sides using similar periods (side one: 1962–67, side two: 1967–70). Side 1 #\\"Hold My Hand\\" - 2:31 #\\"Number One\\" - 2:50 #\\"With a Girl Like You\\" - 1:50 #\\"I Must Be in Love\\" - 2:04 #\\"Ouch!\\" - 1:49 #\\"Living in Hope\\" - 2:37 #\\"Love Life\\" - 2:50 #\\"Nevertheless\\" - 1:29 Side 2 #\\"Good Times Roll\\" - 3:03 #\\"Doubleback Alley\\" - 2:54 #\\"Cheese and Onions\\" - 2:37 #\\"Another Day\\" - 2:09 #\\"Piggy in the Middle\\" - 4:07 #\\"Let's Be Natural\\" - 3:23 The remaining songs floated about as bootlegs until the 1990 re-release on CD. = 1990 CD re-release = The 1990 CD re-release not only restored the full Rutles canon, but also altered the running order of the tracks (this time intending to obviously align the songs chronologically as they would have been released individually in the Rutles universe). This broke some resemblance to track orders on original Beatles albums where the ending of a Rutles song closely resembled the ending of a Beatles song, and the same for the beginning of the next song. Additionally, \\"Hold My Hand\\" had originally featured a fake \\"airplane\\" intro sound (a nod to \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\") which actually was a hairdryer, along with a count-in to the song. Due to the fact it was not the first song on the CD re-release as it had been on the original LP, this intro was removed.All lead vocals by Neil Innes except: Ollie Halsall on tracks 3 (co-lead with Neil), 7, 12, 17 and 19; Rikki Fataar on tracks 5, 8, and 14; and John Halsey on track 9.

The petals are actually small and white - it is the sepals that enlarge to about 12mm after the flower sets fruit and starts to dry out. The specific name gummiferum alludes to the large amounts of gum that is discharged from cut bark. Description Plants initially grow as rounded shrubs but mature to pyramidical trees. The leaves comprise three leaflets and are up to 8 cm long. The petioles are grooved on the upper side and are 10 to 20 mm long. Small, white five-petalled flowers appear in sprays from October in the species' native range. As these die the sepals enlarge and become pink to red in colour, the display peaking at Christmas time in Australia. Taxonomy Ceratopatalum gummiferum is one of nine species in the genus Ceratopetalum which occur in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The species was first formally described by English botanist James Edward Smith in 1793 in A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to New South Wales where it occurs to the east of the Great Dividing Range from Ulladulla in the south to Evans Head in the north. Cultivation In cultivation, plants usually grow to no more than 6 metres in height. Plants may be propagated from seed or cuttings, the latter method being preferred to maintain good colour forms. Well-drained soil is required to avoid problems with dieback associated with root-rot fungus.

Nanoor is the birthplace of 14th century lyric poet Chandidas of Vaishnava Padavali fame. It is developing as a craft centre with NGO support. With the massacres in 2000, Nanoor was in intense media focus. History =Archaeological finds= The archaeological department of Calcutta University organised an excavation programme in Nanoor in 1932 and 1957 but nothing much has happened since then. The archaeological discoveries at Jalundi village in Nanoor block in 2007 are believed to be the ruins of the ancient Pala or Sen dynasties. =Chandidas= According to the historian Binoy Ghosh, there were at least three poets associated with the name of Chandidas. They were identified as ‘Baru’, ‘Dwija’ and ‘Din’. Baru Chandidas possibly belonged to Chhatna in Bankura district and he composed Srikrishnakirtan. Not much is known about Din Chandidas, except that he also composed on the life of Sri Krishna. Dwija Chandidas possibly belonged to Nanoor and composed lyrically rich creations initiating the finest traditions of Bengali padavali (gathering of songs). The Nanoor-Kirnahar area is full of folk-myths about Chandidas – the story of his love for a washer woman, the story of his religious devotion and music and the story of his death.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 261-266, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata The temple of Bisalakhi or Bagisree (more popular as Basuli) is believed to have been the centre of the devotional activity of Chandidas. The place at Nanoor where the Basuli temple (see pic lower down on this page) now stands and the surrounding area resembling a mound is called Chandibhita (see pic in the infobox). An effort was made by the University of Calcutta to understand what is there in the mound by excavating a small section of it. In the “Excavations at Nanoor by K.G.Goswami, March 1950”, the report says that in the mound, with a radius of around 550 feet and height of 17 feet, there are five occupational levels. The lowest of these levels belong to the Gupta era. At another place in Nanoor, some coins of the Gupta era were recovered. During and prior to the Gupta era, Buddhism had a strong hold over Bengal and early tantric practices prevailed. Chandidas lived about 500 years ago, just around or a little prior to the arrival of Muslims in Bengal. By then the poet Jaydeva had already composed the Gita Govinda (see map below for location of Jayadev Kenduli). It is natural that such an age could produce a tantric devoted to his goddess, who could indulge in composing Sahajiya lyrics and propagate the merits of humanism. His compositions were a possible source of inspiration for Sri Chaitanya (1486-1534). There are claims that Chandidas originally belonged to Ketugram, in neighbouring Purba Bardhaman district, and later came to Nanoor.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 188-189, Prakash Bhaban Geography =Location= Nanoor is located at . It has an average elevation of . It is 47 km from Suri, 18 km from Bolpur/Santiniketan and 29 km from Ahmedpur. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the area. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. =Physical features= Nanoor is located in the south-eastern corner of the district which is an alluvial plain between Ajay and Mayurakshi Rivers. It has hot and dry summers, spread over March - May, followed by the monsoon from June to September. 78 per cent of the rainfall occurs during this period.Choudhuri, Tapan, Unnayaner Alokey Birbhum, Paschim Banga , Birbhum Special Issue, February 2006, , pp. 60-61, Information & Cultural Department, Government of West Bengal. As per historical records there have been at least 13 intensive droughts between the years 1799 and 1855. The drought of 1836-37 was particularly severe.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, The Economic Life of a Bengal District: Birbhum 1770 - 1857, p. 114, The University of Burdwan, 1984. Floods also wreak havoc. Some 7,000 mud houses either collapsed or remained in bad shape in Nanoor and three other blocks, affecting around 15,000 villagers in 2004. =Police station= Nanoor police station has jurisdiction over Nanoor CD block. =CD block HQ= The headquarters of Nanoor CD block are located at Nanoor. Demographics As per the 2011 Census of India, Chandidas Nanur had a total population of 8,399 of which 4,268 (51%) were males and 4,131 (49%) were females. Population below 6 years was 977. The total number of literates in Chandidas Nanur was 5,409 (72.88% of the population over 6 years). Socio-economics Nanoor Block covering 24 villages, is economically backward. It has many artisan families who live below the poverty line. A large section of the population is either Muslim or belong to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Although the population is talented they hardly had an opportunity to earn a decent living. The Institute of International Social Development – an international NGO, based and headquartered in Kolkata, has initiated steps to rectify the situation. The artisans get an opportunity to meet people from different countries. Such people visit Nanoor to have a first hand experience of the living and working conditions of artisans. Internationally renowned designers are helping the artisans to use the traditional kantha craft for producing modern-day utilities. Traditionally, there used to be a weekly market, locally called hat. Apart from vegetables, such needs as pottery, wooden materials, iron materials, baskets, seeds etc. were available. With the passage of time the periodicity gradually increased till it became a daily market.Mukhopadhyay Aditya, Birbhumer Mela, Paschim Banga , Birbhum Special Issue, February 2006, , pp. 203-214, Information & Cultural Department, Government of West Bengal. Nanoor massacre On 27 July 2000, CPI(M) activists allegedly killed 11 landless agricultural labourers in Suchpur, near Nanoor and under Nanoor police station. Just after the massacre CPI(M) leaders said those killed were dacoits but a few days later they admitted that the dead were landless farmers and that they were killed over a land dispute. Two of the CPI(M)'s senior leaders, Anil Biswas and Biman Bose, both politburo members, condemned the Nanoor killings as well as the loss of lives in incidents of violence in the preceding weeks. The Hindu wrote, \\"On a long term, the killings, symbolising the birth of a new theatre of violence after Keshpur in district Midnapore - where deaths and maiming in political clashes have become a bizarre routine - constitute an extremely disturbing augury for the society in Bengal.\\" The prime witness to the Nanoor killings was injured in an attack allegedly by CPI-M activists. The Statesman, in an editorial, wrote, \\"The sole purpose in attacking the prime witness in the gruesome Nanoor massacre of July 2000 in which 11 Trinamul Congress supporters were slaughtered by armed CPI(M) cadres was to shield those responsible and abort their trial, by hook or by crook. The irony is that although five years have elapsed since the occurrence of the horrendous killings by the Marxists, the trial of their 79 accused comrades has not yet begun. Repeated postponement of hearing (at least seven in the last two years) because of failure of the accused to turn up in court has made the outcome uncertain.\\" The Nanoor area has continued to be turbulent, with political clashes and murders continuing. On the basis of a FIR (first information report) lodged with the police against CPI(M) men, the police made arrests and in August 2001 they submitted charge sheets against 82 accused. The trial started in 2000 and continued for eight years. The session court delivered verdict on Nanoor Massacre case in 2010, when 44 persons were convicted and sentenced to Life Imprisonment. Out of the 44, four were CPI(M) members. Education Nanoor Chandidas Memorial High School is a Bengali- medium co-educational institution established in 1937. It has arrangements for teaching from Class V to XII. Chandidas Mahavidyalaya was established at Khujutipara in 1972. Culture =Temples= Bisalkshi temple There is a temple dedicated to Devi Basuli at Nanoor. The Navaratna temple at Brahmandihi, Kirnahar Vadrokali Tala Temple , Parota Mahaprabhu Tala Temple and the Chand Roy temple and four Shiva temples at Uchkaran are amongst the temples under the protection of the state archaeological department. The renowned Navaratna temple was undertaken by the ASI but is now in bad shape. The four Shiva temples carry somewhat unusual terra cotta sculptures that need preservation. In 2001, the invaluable and rare black-stone Saraswati idol went missing from the Bishalakshmi temple. Nanoor temples David J. McCutchion mentions several temples in the Nanoor area: (1) the Shiva temple at Thupsara built in 1833 as a standard (small) tightly ridged early rekha deul of Birbhum-Bardhaman type with terracotta carvings on three sides, (2) the Jora Shiva temples at Serandi built in 1830 as a late wide ridging (banded) rekha deul with terracotta carvings, (3) the four Shiva temples at Uchkaron built in 1769 as standard small char chala structures with rich terracotta facades, Terracotta carvings in a Nanoor temple (4) the small decorated char chala Shiva temples at Nanoor, (5) the Jora Shiva temple at Nanoor as a standard ‘Hooghly-Burdwan’ 18th century or earlier small at chala structures, (6) the Vishnu temple at Serandi built in mid 19th century as a navaratna with turrets arranged without an upper storey and with porches on triple archways with terracotta façade, and (7) the renovated Chand Raya (1768) temple at Uchkaran as a small flat roofed or Chandni type structure with traditional pillars and terracotta decoration.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, pages 23, 24, 30, 31, 37, 54, 63. The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, =Fairs= A fair is organized annually on the occasion of dol purnima on the bank of the Dontapukur at Nanoor in memory of Chandidas and Rajakini (washerwoman) Tami. It is called Chandidas Mela and was earlier organized near Bisalkshi temple. Japeswar Shiva-Charturdashi Mela is organized at Japeswar in the Nanoor area.

Background Nanoor is located in the south-eastern corner of the district which is an alluvial plain between Ajay River and Mayurakshi River. It has hot and dry summers, spread over March - May, followed by the monsoon from June to September. 78 per cent of the rainfall occurs during this period.Choudhuri, Tapan, Unnayaner Alokey Birbhum, Paschim Banga , Birbhum Special Issue, February 2006, , pp. 60-61, Information & Cultural Department, Government of West Bengal.

Some 7,000 mud houses either collapsed or remained in bad shape in Nanoor and three other blocks, affecting around 15,000 villagers in 2004. Nanoor Block covering 24 villages, is economically backward. It has many artisan families who live below the poverty line. A large section of the population is either Muslim or belong to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Although the population is talented they hardly had an opportunity to earn a decent living. Nanoor was described by The Statesman in 2003 as \\"the most politically disturbed area in Birbhum district\\". With acute poverty it has been a disturbed area for ages. Massacre Immediately after the Nanoor massacre, the CPI(M) had tried to confuse the public by initially referring to those killed as dacoits and so on. However, when a spate of reports appeared in the press they were forced to admit that they were indeed landless agricultural wage workers, who were killed because of a land dispute. Somnath Chatterjee, then speaker of the Lok Sabha, in whose parliamentary constituency Nanoor fell, described those killed as \\"hired goons, dacoits and dreaded anti- socials\\". The CPI(M) had earlier been trying to analyse what happened in Nanoor as a fight between farmers and landlords desperate to recapture land they had lost earlier but they late changed course. Anil Biswas and Biman Bose, both politburo members and senior leaders of CPI(M), condemned the Nanoor killings and also the violence caused by political rivalry resulting in deaths earlier in the area. The Hindu wrote, \\"On a long term, the killings, symbolizing the birth of a new theater of violence after Keshpur in district Midnapore - where deaths and maiming in political clashes have become a bizarre routine - constitute an extremely disturbing augury for the society in Bengal\\". The West Bengal Chief Minister, Jyoti Basu, said that at least 800 Left Front party workers, mostly belonging to the CPI(M) had been killed in clashes with the supporters of the Trinamool-BJP combine. He felt that everybody, including Left party workers had the right of self-defence, but appealed to them to restrain themselves even in the face of atrocities. Aftermath Abdul Khalek, the prime witness to the Nanoor killings, and his guard, Jahangir Alam, were injured in an attack allegedly by CPI(M) activists, on 12 May 2005. Four people were arrested for the attack, the next day. Although local people thought of the arrested as having links with the ruling party, police were yet to ascertain their political connections. The Statesman in an editorial wrote, \\"The sole purpose in attacking the prime witness in the gruesome Nanoor massacre of July 2000 in which 11 Trinamul Congress supporters were slaughtered by armed CPI(M) cadres was to shield those responsible and abort their trial, by hook or by crook.

In 2005, The Statesman in an editorial said, \\"Repeated postponement of hearing (at least seven in the last two years) because of failure of the accused to turn up in court has made the outcome uncertain.\\" Just before start of the Nannor massacre trials in 2005 CPI(M) cadre were allegedly creating panic in the area threatening the witnesses repeatedly. A Trinamul Congress delegation visiting the villages to is reported that though there were a few police camps, the villages in the area were still in the grip of CPI(M) men. Two main accused in the Nanoor massacre, Nitya Chatterjee and Manirujjaman, filed nominations as CPI(M) candidates for the panchayat polls in 2003. In 2004, the West Bengal Government was reprimanded by Kolkata High Court for slow progress in the Nanoor massacre trial. Political equations Nanoor was traditionally considered one of the strongest bastions of CPI(M) in Birbhum district. However, the Nanoor massacres brought about a considerable change in the scenario. The Trinamul Congress started building on the unfortunate and has developed a base in the area. The changing scenario has been rather noticeable. In 2003, the CPI(M) charged Trinamul Congress with terrorising voters in the area, and demanded fresh polling in a majority of the booths in the Thupsara panchayat area in Nanoor block. The Nanoor area has continued to be turbulent, with political clashes and murders continuing. There are certain villages in the area which are known as Trinamool Congress strongholds and CPI(M) has been trying to capture such villages. On the basis of a FIR (first information report) lodged with the police against CPI(M) men, the police made arrests and in August 2001 the police submitted charge sheets against 82 accused. The trial started in 2000 and continued for eight years. During the trial 10 accused persons have died. The police has not been able to arrest five of the accused. Thirty-two witnesses have appeared in court. The court verdict is expected in November 2010.  Verdict on Nanoor  The session court delivered verdict on Nanoor Massacre case in 2010, when 44 persons were convicted and sentenced to Life Imprisonment. Out of the 44, four were CPI(M) members.

He is the founder and head of the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees. Personal life Parsi was born in Shiraz, Iran. As a gay Iranian, he felt alone until at age 15 he discovered solace in the Internet. Parsi began volunteering for underground gay organizations. At age 19, he began working for PGLO and networked with doctors to provide HIV testing. He responded to emails from suicidal gay teenagers. The strict laws against homosexuality forced Parsi to keep his work secret from friends and family. But in March 2005, Parsi realized the police were looking for him and fled from Iran to Turkey, where he spent 13 months. Unable to return to Iran, Parsi lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Activism In 2001, Parsi had formed a small LGBT group online called Rangin Kaman (Rainbow Group), which was renamed as Persian Gay and Lesbian Organization in 2004. As the PGLO would not be recognized in Iran, a friend of Parsi's officially registered PGLO in Norway. The PGLO later became the foundation for Parsi's Toronto-based Iranian Queer Organization (IRQO) in 2006. Parsi later left IRQO and founded the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees in 2008. The organization's headquarters are in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and they provide services to all self- identified Iranian LGBTs worldwide. He began secretly working for the advancement of civil rights for lesbians and gays in Iran. In 2003, he helped organize a clandestine Yahoo chat group for gay Iranians, called Voice Celebration. The group had 50 participants, who exchanged views on how best to achieve civil rights. Less than three years later, he was asked to speak publicly in Geneva, Switzerland, at the second session of United Nations Human Rights Council and on the fourth anniversary all international media published some articles about Iranian gays and lesbians. Parsi was the executive director of the Iranian Queer Organization and director of the organization's online magazine, Cheraq for several years. In October 2008 he launched Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees. Parsi has been working on Iranian queer asylum cases. He is an Iranian member of the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA), based in Brussels, Belgium, and ambassador of Iran in the International Lesbian and Gay Cultural Network (ILGCN), based in Stockholm, Sweden. Director of the cultural committee at the Iranian Association of University of Toronto (IAUT) in 2007, Parsi is also a founding member of the Rainbow Railroad group based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the Advisory Committee of the Hirschfeld Eddy Foundation. Parsi's autobiography, Exiled for Love, was written with Marc Colbourne and published by Fernwood Publishing in 2015.  International Recognition  In April 2008, Iranian Queer Organization (IRQO) which was his former organization name awarded Felipa de Souza Award in 2008 by the New York-based International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC). Two months later, Parsi's work was recognized with the Pride Toronto Award for Excellence in Human Rights. In June 2015, Parsi was awarded by Logo TV for the International Trailblazer. Parsi is being featured in two galleries of Canadian Museum for Human Rights that is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Parsi and Marina Nemat are the only two Iranians that were selected for the museum.  Documentaries  Parsi was interviewed by many major international media about the rights of LGBT people in Iran and Middle East and also featured in several documentaries including CBC Gay in Iran in 2007, A Jihad for Love by Parvez Sharma, and BBC's Iran Sex Change Solution by Ali Hamedani and many more.  Civil Defamation Lawsuit  On April 23, 2018, a Toronto Small Claims Court found Parsi liable for defamation of Soheila Amintorabi, who is also known as Shadi Amin, for activities taking place on the anonymous website \\"justice4lgbt.com\\".http://justice4lgbt.com/ArshamParsi- SoheilaAmintorabi-CourtTranscript.pdf Parsi's position was that he was not responsible for the website and has no knowledge of the parties who operate it; however, Deputy Judge Ashby of the Small Claims Court found that \\"[o]n a balance of probabilities, I am persuaded that Mr. Parsi was involved the creation and publication of the articles on justice4lbgt.com and for the email.\\" \\"On a balance of probabilities\\" means that the court used the civil standard that a fact is more likely to be true than not, which is a lower standard than the higher \\"beyond reasonable doubt standard\\" in a criminal trial (see Burden of proof (law)). Having found Parsi was involved with the website, the Deputy Judge found that certain articles published on the website \\"justice4lgbt.com\\" were defamatory, and awarded $25,000 in damages. Parsi's response to the ruling was made in a statement in which he said that \\"I am at peace with the outcome of the court and grateful that it ended the way it did\\" because he was \\"placed in a very difficult position.\\" Parsi went on to say \\"In order to defend myself, I was continually asked to disclose the names of LGBT+ individuals who reside in Iran and may have had some connection with Justice4LGBT, the defamatory website.\\" Homosexuality is punishable in Iran by death.LGBT Rights in Iran Parsi stated that he believes the damages he has been ordered to pay are a small price to pay for the safety of these LGBT+ individuals in Iran. In a statement published on Justice4LGBT following the trial, the persons behind justice4lgbt stated \\"Mr. Arsham Parsi is a well-know Iranian LGBT human rights activist and he was not involved in creation, management, publication, distribution and operation of Justice4LGBT in any capacities.\\" Amin has taken the position that Tabandeh, the director and coordinator of the website and author of at least one of the materials which Parsi was accused of authoring, is not a real person.

In 2011, Hill announced he was resigning from the Florida Senate to serve as Federal Policy Director in Jacksonville mayor Alvin Brown's administration. While he was in the Florida Senate, he served on the following committees: Transportation & Economic Development Appropriations (Vice Chair); Community Affairs; Children, Families, and Elder Affairs; Policy and Steering Committee on Governmental Operations; Military Affairs and Domestic Security; Policy and Steering Committee on Ways and Means; Regulated Industries; Select Committee on Florida's Economy and was Chair of the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations. He was the Senate Democratic Floor Leader and was appointed by the Senate President to serve on the Home Ownership Promotes The Economy (HOPE) Task Force. Political career =State House of Representatives= Prior to being elected to the Florida Senate, Hill was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, District 14, in 1992 and subsequently re-elected, unopposed, for three consecutive terms. After leaving the Florida House in 2000, due to term limits, he continued his leadership activities: co-chaired the Florida Coalition to Reduce Class Size, resulting in Florida Constitutional Amendment 9, requiring smaller class sizes. After being elected to the Senate he led the fight to make sure Amendment 9 was implemented. =State Senate= During the 2004 election Hill served as Florida's Statewide Co-Chair for the Minimum Wage Initiative, which helped successfully raise Florida's minimum wage. Hill led a successful effort in the Florida Senate to pass a resolution formally apologizing for the Legislature's support of slavery and expressing Florida's profound regret for the shameful chapter in the state's history. Florida followed Maryland, Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey in offering an apology for slavery. Hill and Representative Ed Holman spearheaded a legislative initiative regarding Florida's state song, \\"Old Folks at Home (Swanee River)\\", written by Stephen Foster. The song, whose original lyrics refer to the \\"de old plantation\\" and to \\"darkeys\\", is offensive to many Floridians. As a result of their efforts, \\"Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky),\\" by Florida music teacher Jan Hinton was selected as state anthem, and the lyrics to \\"Old Folks at Home\\" have been revised to eliminate the racially insensitive passages. While serving as Chair of the Florida Conference of Black State Legislators, Hill and other members encouraged Florida's Governor Charlie Crist to issue an Executive Order establishing a Task Force to develop the requirements needed for the State of Florida to begin the process of restoring Civil Rights and streamlining the restoring of Voting Rights to felons who have completed their sentences and all other court ordered requirements. In 2007, the Governor issued an Executive Order that provided for the restoration of the civil rights for certain ex-offenders. Under the rule, the civil rights of ex- offenders who have committed less severe non-violent crimes, and meeting certain requirements, qualify for approval without a hearing. In 2007, Hill was appointed to a three-year term as an at-Large member to the Executive Board of the National Black Caucus of States Institute (NBCSI). Also, in October 2007, in conjunction with Enterprise Florida, Hill led a trade delegation to South Africa and Namibia, visiting Johannesburg, Pretoria, Bela Bela, Cape Town, East London and Windhoek as a continuation of Florida's efforts to expand business and cultural partnerships in Southern Africa. During the 2008 presidential election, Hill was served as Florida's Co-Chair of the Florida Change Committee (and as a member of the Florida Advisory Council) for Senator Barack Obama's successful bid for the Presidency. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel included Hill among the five individuals, the \\"Fave Five,\\" whom, according to the Sun-Sentinel, then-candidate Barack Obama needed to know in Florida if he wanted to carry the state in the general election. Hill led a state-wide bus tour, \\"It's About Us OBAMA/BIDEN\\". He was one of two Democratic state senators selected as electors to cast votes for Obama in 2008. Also in 2008, Hill was elected to a four-year term as a member to the Democratic National Committee and appointed to a four-year term as a member of the Florida Democratic Executive Committee. In the August 2009 Special Issue of Florida Trend Magazine, Senator Hill was featured as one of the \\"Must-Know Jacksonville Leaders\\", with the quotation \\" State Sen. Tony Hill was an early supporter of Barack Obama. He still has Obama's ear.\\" In September 2009 the national political magazine Campaign and Elections Magazine included Hill as one of the fifty Democrats in \\"People of Influence.\\" In October 2009, Hill led another delegation to Dakar, Senegal, and the South African cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg. In April 2010, Hill and a delegation of heads of state and key representatives of the African Diaspora traveled to Senegal to celebrate 50 years of independence with Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade. In 2011, Hill announced he was resigning from the Florida Senate to serve as Federal Policy Director in Jacksonville mayor Alvin Brown's administration.

When it is running, it creates a bar at the top of the screen that greatly magnifies where the mouse is. Magnifier was first included as a sample in the Active Accessibility SDK/RDK for Windows 95 and later made a standard Windows utility starting with Windows 98. Prior to Windows Vista, Magnifier could be used to magnify the screen up to 9 times its normal size. Windows Vista and later allow up to 16× magnification. In Windows Vista, Magnifier uses WPF, which in turn uses vector images to render the content. As a result, the rendered magnified image is sharp and not pixelated. However, this is useful only for Windows Presentation Foundation applications. Non-WPF applications are still magnified the traditional way. Also, due to a change introduced in WPF 3.5 SP1, this functionality is lost if .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is installed. Microsoft has also released a Magnification API to allow assistive technology applications to use the Magnifier engine. Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system includes a significantly improved version of Magnifier. It features full-screen magnification which allows a user to pan around the screen at up to 16× magnification. The pre-Windows 10 icon. However, the full screen feature has also been criticized due to its incompatibility with the high contrast color schemes found in the Windows 7 beta release. This issue remains in the final Windows 7 release. Besides this, when the magnifier zooms, the text will appear blurry or pixelated because it is not being directly rendered at the larger size; instead, the smaller sized rendering is being enlarged as a raster image. ClearType sub-pixel anti-aliasing is also magnified as a result of this, so if ClearType is active, the magnified text may appear to have unexpected colors at the edges of non-horizontal lines. Some third party magnification software compensates for this effect by applying scaling filters to the enlarged image. The magnifier also features a lens mode similar to that found in the existing version of the software. Lens mode is improved, however, as now the magnifying window will follow the cursor around the screen rather than remain in a fixed position. Finally the magnifier is much easier to access by using the Windows key and +/- to control the zoom level without the need to start the application first. Pressing the Win+Esc combination will exit the magnifier.

Van Lear was a member of the Socialist Party of America. Early life Van Lear was born in Maryland in 1869. As a boy, he worked in the area's coal mines and, at the age of 18, he joined the Knights of Labor. He later served in the United States Army (including a year during the Spanish–American War) before relocating to Minneapolis to work as a machinist. He soon became active with the International Association of Machinists and other trade and union groups in the city.  Career  Van Lear led two unsuccessful campaigns for the mayoralty before he was elected on November 7, 1916, with over 33,000 votes. Van Lear did not win control of the city council, and Sheriff Otto Langum worked closely with the Minneapolis Citizens' Alliance, an anti-labor coalition of wealthy business magnates. In office, Van Lear welcomed the People's Council of America for Democracy and the Terms of Peace to Minneapolis and refused to approve a law that would effectively ban the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The only Socialist mayor in the city's history, Van Lear was defeated for re-election in 1918, amid accusations that he and his supporters secretly desired a German victory in World War I. Van Lear was expelled from the Socialist Party of America in 1918 and later helped to form a local section of the Nonpartisan League that firmly supported the policies of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. In 1919, Van Lear worked with Herbert Gaston to found the populist Minnesota Daily Star newspaper. The first issue was printed in August 1920. While the paper had some success as a political tool, it had a difficult time attracting advertisers and went bankrupt in 1924.  Death  Van Lear died on March 4, 1931. He is interred at Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery in Minneapolis.

It is often expressed in chill hours, which can be calculated in different ways, all of which essentially involve adding up the total amount of time in a winter spent at certain temperatures. Some bulbs have chilling requirements to bloom, and some seeds have chilling requirements to sprout. Biologically, the chilling requirement is a way of ensuring that vernalization occurs.  Chilling units or chilling hours  A chilling unit in agriculture is a metric of a plant's exposure to chilling temperatures. Chilling temperatures extend from freezing point to, depending on the model, or even .Byrne, D. H., and T. A. Bacon (1992). Chilling estimation: its importance and estimation. The Texas Horticulturist 18(8):5, 8-9. Retrieved 2010-05-24. Stone fruit trees and certain other plants of temperate climate develop next year's buds in the summer. In the autumn the buds become dormant, and the switch to proper, healthy dormancy is triggered by a certain minimum exposure to chilling temperatures. Lack of such exposure results in delayed and substandard foliation, flowering and fruiting. One chilling unit, in the simplest models, is equal to one hour's exposure to the chilling temperature; these units are summed up for a whole season. Advanced models assign different weights to different temperature bands. Requirements According to Fishman, chilling in trees acts in two stages. The first is reversible: chilling helps to build up the precursor to dormancy, but the process can be easily reversed with a rise in temperature. After the level of precursor reaches a certain threshold, dormancy becomes irreversible and will not be affected by short-term warm temperature peaks. Apples have the highest chilling requirements of all fruit trees, followed by apricots and, lastly, peaches. Apple cultivars have a diverse range of permissible minimum chilling: most have been bred for temperate weather, but Gala and Fuji can be successfully grown in subtropical Bakersfield, California.Hall, Anthony (2001). Crop responses to environment. CRC Press. . p. 87. Peach cultivars in Texas range in their requirements from 100 chilling units (Florida Grande cultivar, zoned for low chill regions) to 1,000 units (Surecrop, zoned for high chill regions).Kamas, J.; McEachern, J. R; Stein, L.; Roe, N. (1998). Peach Production in Texas, table 1. Texas A&M; University. Retrieved 2010-05-24. Planting a low-chilling cultivar in a high-chill region risks loss of a year's harvest when an early bloom is hit by a spring frost. A high- chilling cultivar planted in a low-chill region will, quite likely, never fruit at all. A four-year study of Ruston Red Alabama peach, which has a threshold of 850 chilling units, demonstrated that a seasonal chilling deficiency of less than 50 units has no effect on harvest. Deficiency of 50 to 100 units may result in loss of up to 50% of expected harvest. Deficiency of 250 hours and more is a sure loss of practically whole harvest; the few fruit will be of very poor quality and have no market value.Powell, A. (1999). Action Program for Dormex Application on Peaches . Auburn University. Retrieved 2010-05-24. Rest-breaking agents (e.g. hydrogen cyanamide, trade name BudPro or Dormex), applied in spring, can partially mitigate the effects of insufficient chilling. BudPro can substitute for up to 300 hours of chilling, but an excessive spraying and timing error can easily damage the buds. Other products such as Dormex use stabilizing compounds. Chilling of orange trees has two effects. First, it increases production of carotenoids and decreases chlorophyll content of the fruit, improving their appearance and, ultimately, their market value. Second, the \\"quasi-dormancy\\" experienced by orange trees triggers concentrated flowering in spring, as opposed to more or less uniform round-the-year flowering and fruiting in warmer climates. Biennial plants like cabbage, sugar beet, celery and carrots need chilling to develop second-year flowering buds. Excessive chilling in the early stages of a sugar beet seedling, on the contrary, may trigger undesired growth of a flowering stem (bolting) in its first year. This phenomenon has been offset by breeding sugar beet cultivars with a higher minimum chilling threshold. Such cultivars can be seeded earlier than normal without the risk of bolting. Models All models require hourly recording of temperatures. The simplest model assigns one chilling unit for every full hour at temperatures below . A slightly more sophisticated model excludes freezing temperatures, which do not contribute to proper dormancy cycle, and counts only hours with temperatures between and . The Utah model assigns different weight to different temperature bands; a full unit per hour is assigned only to temperatures between and . Maximum effect is achieved at . Temperatures between and (the threshold between chilling and warm weather) have zero weight, and higher temperature have negative weights: they reduce the beneficial effects of an already accumulated chilling hours. Southwick et al. wrote that neither of these models is accurate enough to account for application of rest-breaking agents widely used in modern farming. They advocated the use of a dynamic model tailored to the two-stage explanation of dormancy.Southwick, S.; Khan, Z.; Glozer, K. (2003).

Johnson Hall is located at Hall Avenue, West State Street and Johnson Avenue, in Johnstown, New York. History The mansion in 2020 The house was built seven miles from the Mohawk River, close to Hall Creek. Hall Creek provided water sufficient to power a sawmill and later a grist mill. Built of wood, the house frame was covered with wood planks intended to simulate stone. Johnson engaged leading colonial architect Peter Harrison (1716-1775) to design the house; he hired the carpenter, Samuel Fuller, to build it. At least some of the ideas for the house came from the Builders' Companion magazine. Johnson also had two stone block houses built as defenses against attack on the frontier, as the British had just ended the Seven Years' War with the French. The stonehouses were also used for storage and other domestic uses. Johnson founded Johnstown, New York, and came to own a estate. Johnson moved here from Old Fort Johnson in 1763 and lived here until he died in 1774. The house was inherited by his son, John Johnson. During the American Revolution, the rebel government in New York seized Johnson Hall because the Johnsons had gone to Canada as Loyalists. In 1779 the state sold the house to Silas Talbot, a migrant from New England. It was used as a private residence by various owners until 1906, when the state bought it for preservation and interpretation as a house museum of the most important colonial landowner in the state. It received restoration in the early twentieth century and in the 1950s, to remove additions of the late nineteenth century and better reflect its original time. The historic site includes more than 18 acres of land. The mansion and the West Stonehouse are the only original structures on the site; the East Stonehouse is a reproduction.Historic sign on site The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. and See also * List of National Historic Landmarks in New York * List of New York State Historic Sites References  External links  * *Revolutionary War Heritage Trail: Johnson Hall State Historic Site, Heritage New York *Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS): ** ** Historic American Buildings Survey in New York (state) Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) National Historic Landmarks in New York (state) New York (state) historic sites Museums in Fulton County, New York Biographical museums in New York (state) Houses completed in 1763 Historic house museums in New York (state) Houses in Fulton County, New York National Register of Historic Places in Fulton County, New York ","title":"Johnson Hall State Historic Site"},{"id":"13285416","text":"Nagata Station is the name of eight train stations in Japan: * Nagata Station (Saitama) (永田駅) - in Fukaya, Saitama, on the Chichibu Main Line * Nagata Station (Chiba) (永田駅) - in Oamishirasato, Sanbu District, Chiba, on the JR East Sotobo Line * Nagata Station (Osaka) (長田駅) - in Higashiosaka, Osaka, on the Osaka Municipal Subway Chuo Line and the Kintetsu Keihanna Line * Nagata Station (Kobe Municipal Subway) (長田駅) - in Nagata-ku, Kobe, on the Kobe Municipal Subway Seishin-Yamate Line, * Nagata Station (Shintetsu) (長田駅) - in Nagata-ku, Kobe, on the Kobe Electric Railway Arima Line * Kosoku Nagata Station (高速長田駅) - in Nagata-ku, Kobe, on the Hanshin Railway Kobe Kosoku Line, close to Nagata Station on the Kobe Subway Seishin-Yamate Line * Kii-Nagata Station (紀伊長田駅) - in Kinokawa, Wakayama, on the JR West Wakayama Line * Hizen- Nagata Station (肥前長田駅) - in Isahaya, Nagasaki, on the JR Kyushu Nagasaki Main Line ","title":"Nagata Station"},{"id":"13285423","text":"Nagaura Station (長浦駅) is the name of two train stations in Japan: * Nagaura Station (Aichi) * Nagaura Station (Chiba) ","title":"Nagaura Station"},{"id":"13285437","text":"alt=A road running through Durris Forest with an old field wall alongside Durris Forest is a chiefly coniferous forest south of the River Dee approximately three kilometres west of Netherley in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.Ordnance Survey Map, United Kingdom, Landranger 45, Stonehaven and Banchory, 1:50,000 scale (2004) (Ordnance Survey, 2004) The A957 road forms the southwest boundary of Durris Forest, separating it from Fetteresso Forest.

Baseball-Reference is part of Sports Reference, LLC; according to an article in Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal, the company's sites have more than 1 million unique users per month. History Founder Sean Forman began developing the website while working on his Ph.D. dissertation in applied math and computational science at the University of Iowa. While writing his dissertation, he had also been writing articles on and blogging about sabermetrics. Forman's database was originally built from the Total Baseball series of baseball encyclopedias. The website went online in April 2000, after first being launched in February 2000 as part of the website for the Big Bad Baseball Annual. It was originally built as a web interface to the Lahman Baseball Database, though it now employs a variety of data sources. In 2004, Forman founded Sports Reference. The company was incorporated as Sports Reference, LLC in 2007. In 2006, Forman left his job as a math professor at Saint Joseph's University in order to focus on Baseball-Reference full-time.

Biography =Early life= He was the son of Lieutenant John Read, and Lucy Read. John Read had received his military title through active service in the French and Indian war. Seth Read's brothers and sisters were: Sarah, born October 24, 1729, (married Josiah Adarns December 27, 1750); Joseph, March 6, 1732; Peter, November 13, 1735; John, June 1743; Seth, March 6, 1746; Josiah, July 23, 1753. Lieutenant John Read died at Uxbridge, January 18, 1771. Seth Reed grew up in the colonial, agricultural and recently incorporated frontier town of Uxbridge. He would become a landowner, a militia member and a farmer. One reference mentioned that he worked as a physician. Read married Hannah Harwood, (b. 1747), in 1768. Their son, Charles John Read, was born on December 23, 1771. Seth and Hannah's son Rufus was born in 1775. Seth and Hannah had seven children, James Manning, Charles John, Sophia, Rufus Seth, Sally Adams, Henry Joseph, George Washington and Mary (Polly) Reed. Seth Read also was the town clerk at Uxbridge from 1777 to 1778. Seth and his brother Joseph attended every meeting in the area having to do with preparing for the revolution. They are mentioned in the minutes of the town meeting as early as 1774 for Revolutionary War preparation and were active in the committee of correspondence. =Revolutionary war service= Lieutenant Colonel Seth Read was commissioned in the Revolutionary War, served in the Battle of Lexington and Concord \\"Alarm\\", and commanded a regiment of troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Massachusetts 26th regiment, under Col. John Patterson on June 17, 1775. He participated in the Invasion of Canada (1775) Campaign in the Massachusetts 15th Regiment up until August 1776 but left active service in January 1777 that year due to health reasons, after the 15th had succumbed to smallpox and hunger. General George Washington stopped at a tavern owned by Colonel Seth Read in June 1775, while on his way to assume command of the Continental Army at Boston. Two years later, Seth Reed is referred to as having received a written vote by the Town of Uxbridge for particular duties related to public safety in the town. \\"the town chose \\"by written votes,\\" Seth Read, \\"to procure and Lay before the court the Evidence that may be had of the Inimical dispositions of any Inhabitant of this town towards this or any of the United States who shall be charged by the freeholders and other Inhabitants of said town, or if their residence within this State is looked upon to be dangerous to the public peace and Safety.\\" In other words, Colonel Read was commissioned to deal with traitors, sedition or suspected treason within the town. Ironically, at least one source claims that Benedict Arnold's widow, Peggy Shippen, died here 59 years later. In the following year the Town of Uxbridge votes to send its troops and resources to the Continental Army. Worcester, Massachusetts Town Records indicate that Colonel Read was elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1780. Read also served as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1779. =Postwar service= Read helped place the motto \\"E pluribus unum\\" on U.S. coins. Massachusetts US coin with motto E Pluribus Unum. Read was a Massachusetts state legislator who introduced coin concept After the war we find references to Seth Read in the early records of Worcester County and the Town of Uxbridge. He remained active in the local political life. Colonel Seth Read served in the Massachusetts General Court, or State Legislature from 1784 to 1786.Marvin, p. 425, 436 In March 1786, Seth Reed petitioned the Massachusetts General Court, both the House and the Senate, for a franchise to mint coins, both copper and silver, and \\"it was concurred\\" (Massachusetts Coppers). According to the U.S. Treasury Colonel Reed of Uxbridge, Massachusetts was said to be instrumental in having E Pluribus Unum placed on United States coins. The phrase is placed on all U.S. coins. The phrase \\"E Pluribus unum\\", \\"Out of Many, One,\\", is now considered the traditional motto of the United States. The United States Treasury was first organized in 1789. The first official U.S. money with printing which included E Pluribus Unum was in 1795, and possibly as early as 1791. The first use of e pluribus unum on any U.S. coins was trace\\"d to copper coins minted at Newburg New York in 1786. The text which cites these earlier printings, again attributes use of e pluribus unum on US coins to Colonel Read of Uxbridge, Mass. Modern US coins have the phrase on the reverse side of the coin, (see the infobox of the one cent coin below where the inscription \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" appears above the Lincoln Memorial). The inaugural journey of President George Washington through New England in 1789 mentions the President's intent to visit his friend Colonel Read on passing through Uxbridge. But Colonel Reed was out of town reportedly moving his family to upstate Geneva, New York. Colonel Reed was reported to be a great landowner in Uxbridge. Another indicator of Seth Read's prominence in early Uxbridge was this citation. Referring to the Capron house in Uxbridge, \\"This house was built by Col. Seth Read, who once owned most of the real estate in this village\\" The biography of Seth Read and his descendants describes that Colonel Seth Read and his brother, Colonel Joseph Read owned half of the land in the town of Uxbridge, and in the town of Northbridge. Their two houses were within a mile and a half of each other on either side of the town common in Uxbridge. But during the war their financial fortunes took a severe reversal and these two entrepreneurial adventurous men returned to Uxbridge to a relative state of poverty. =Pioneer moves: Geneva, New York= Seth Read moved, his wife Hannah and their family to Geneva, Ontario County, New York in the winter of 1790. At the conclusion of the war he moved from Massachusetts into Ontario County, where by trade with the Indians he became owner of a tract of land eighteen miles in extent. This occurred in 1787, while Hannah stayed in Uxbridge with the family. Finally, he sold this property and brought his wife and two sons (James Manning and Charles John) to the present site of Erie, arriving on the 17th of June, 1795. The settlement at Geneva was not permanent yet, and there were attacks by the Indians. =First settler of Erie, Pennsylvania= Aerial view of Presque Isle State Park, Erie, PA, where Colonel Reed settled with his family in 1795. Colonel Reed, Hannah and their family, were then, the first European pioneers and family to have settled Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1795. The family came from Buffalo to Erie in a sail boat, reaching the harbor in the evening and camping on the peninsula over night, for fear of the Indians. Soon after his arrival in June 1795, Colonel Reed erected a log cabin at the mouth of Mill Creek, which was the first permanent building in Erie. Known as the Presque Isle Hotel, it was used by its builder both as family residence and public house. In the following fall the Colonel's others sons, Rufus S. and George W., came to Erie by way of Pittsburgh, and in the succeeding year the family homestead became the well known farm on Walnut Creek, where the pioneer father died at the age of 51 on March 19, 1797, less than two years after his arrival at Mill Creek. Seth Read, in 51 years, left his legacy, as a patriot soldier, a legislator, a pioneer, and as one who was instrumental in the phrase E Pluribus Unum, (\\"From Many, One\\") being added to all U.S. coins. This phrase is considered \\"the traditional motto\\" of the United States. \\"In God We Trust\\" was then added in 1956. Legacy and afterwards His wife (born Hannah Harwood) died in Erie on December 8, 1821 at the age of 74, being the mother of the following children, four sons of whom have already been mentioned: James Manning, Charles John, Sophia, Rufus Seth, Sally Adams, Henry Joseph, George Washington and Mary (Polly). One of his sons celebrated the first marriage recorded in the local annals, and his grandson by this marriage was the first child of European descent born in Erie. Seth and Hannah's grandson, Charles M. Reed became a Whig Congressman, from Pennsylvania, and wealthy great lakes steamship captain from Erie. Colonel Reed, was the great-grandfather of William Ward Reed, who has a prominent place in PA biographies. There were later Congressmen who were descended from Colonel Reed from PA. In Uxbridge, the family name was spelled Read, and in Pennsylvania, as Reed. The Read or Reed family was the most prominent family in northwest Pennsylvania for many decades. The descendants of this same family were extensively scattered across the United States. History of the Read estate at Uxbridge Seth Read House Uxbridge, MA, built circa 1767 at corner of present-day Mendon St, and North Main Street before railroad was built Read water works building on Mumford River. Today it houses a liquor store The former \\"Colonel Seth Read estate and water works\\", built in 1767 and 1777, both at Uxbridge, were purchased in 1790, by John Capron, originally of Cumberland, Rhode Island and later from Grovsvenordale, CT. John Capron pioneered Capron Mills which had the first power looms for woolens, developed at the Mumford River falls, in downtown Uxbridge, where the estate is located. Capron Mills and its successors manufactured U.S. Military uniforms from before the Civil War Period to 1962 including the first U.S. Air force blues. Colonel John Capron's first wife was a descendant of the Read family in Uxbridge. Colonel Read's original home at Uxbridge, known later as a Capron house and later owned by Chase's, was razed in 1967 to make a parking lot for a local drug store. The local drug store, is now a liquor store, and is actually built in the same 1777 grist mill built by Seth Read. The grist mill and water works later served as Bay State Arms, a manufacturer of single shot rifles, in the 1880s. A photograph of this house can be found in the book entitled, \\"Uxbridge, Images of America\\", by B. Mae Edwards Wrona, published in 2000 and in Mary Buford's book about his life.

Architecture The building continued to be used for various school uses until 1998, including at times as an elementary school, for several specialized programs, including secondary and pre-school, and for School Board administrative offices and some School Board meetings. Ralphe Bunche High School alumni formed a preservation committee in 1998 after plans to demolish the building were discussed. In August of that year, the King George County School Board approved a resolution to preserve the building allowing it to be registered as a historical site. In May, 2007 the Ralph Bunche Alumni Association unveiled a commemorative plaque to be placed on the building. The building is currently on the National Register of Historic Places.http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/KingGeorge/048-5007_BuncheHighSch_2006_NRfinal.pdf In 2016, efforts were underway to turn the old school building into the Ralph Bunche Museum and Cultural Centre.

Sargent (November 1, 1842 - February 25, 1914) was an American architect, known for his work on New York City schools, churches, office buildings, clubs, armory and country homes. Life and career Sargent was born Ebenezer Alfred Sargent on November 1, 1842 in Hastings, England. He later changed his first name to Edward. Emigrating to New York City in 1867, he attended Cooper Union College. Sargent married Mary Augusta Doubleday (daughter of Thomas D. Doubleday and niece of Abner Doubleday); together they had four daughters and one son. One daughter, Alice Sargent Johnson, became an illustrator. His brother was D. W. Sargent, an explorer in Africa. His first work was as a watercolor artist. He worked as a delineator (illustrator) for Frederick Law Olmsted in the designs for Central Park and again as delineator worked on the Corn Exchange Building and the Protestant Welfare building on Park Avenue. He made the plans for the 9th Regiment Armory, constructed the country home Lindenhurst for John Wanamaker at Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. In addition, he was the architect of public schools and private houses, including over 300 homes on Staten Island. Sargent also worked for George Post (who built the first building to have an elevator). Works Sargent designed the stone masonry pillars and wing walls of the entryways to the planned community of Rochelle Park in New Rochelle, New York in 1885. He designed large and medium-sized residences in the metropolitan New York area, notably in the St. George/New Brighton historic district of Staten Island . Sargent has been credited with designing the Vanderzee-Harper House (circa 1887) at Westervelt Avenue (St. George/New Brighton historic district), although documentation for this attribution is lacking. Among the many notable Sargent-designed homes in the St. George/New Brighton historic district is 103 St. Mark's Place, originally built by Sargent for banker Frederick A. Rodewald in 1890. In 1892, the firm of E. A. Sargent & Co. were the architects of the original American Yacht Club clubhouse on Milton Point (destroyed by fire in 1951). He designed the Cuyler Presbyterian Church (1892) in Brooklyn . In 1894, the firm of W.E. Cable and E.A. Sargent won a competition from among nineteen bids to design and build the 9th Regiment Armory on 14th Street Manhattan. Completed in 1896, the armory was razed in 1969. Sargent also designed the Romanesque-style Mother A.M.E. Zion Church (1903-1904) at 127 West 89th Street, Manhattan (razed in 1934).  References  Sources * *Sargent, E.

The device is categorized as a mechanical force manual assisted (MFMA) instrument which is generally regarded as a softer chiropractic treatment technique. Activator V Chiropractic Adjusting Instrument  Activator Adjusting Instrument  An Activator II instrument The traditional Activator Adjusting Instrument (AAI), or more simply, Activator, is a small handheld spring-loaded instrument which delivers a controlled and reproducible impulse to the spine. With the release of the Activator V this process has changed from a spring-loaded grip to an electronic tool which delivers the mechanical force. It was found to give off no more than 0.3 J of kinetic energy in a 3-millisecond pulse. The aim is to produce enough force to move the vertebrae but not enough to cause injury. The design of the tool was based on a dental impactor. Activator I was the first product patented by Activator Methods International on September 26, 1978. In 1994 the Activator II was first released when research at the University of Vermont found that when the initial instrument was given an impedance head it produced a \\"significant improvement in the frequency content\\" of the force delivered to the spine. This led to a better activation of mechanoreceptors when adjusting a specific segment of the spine. Activator V is the newest iteration of Activator products and is a cordless instrument capable of delivering its own adjustment. It is the first FDA registered and approved cordless electronic chiropractic adjustment instrument.  Leg length test reliability  Although prone \\"functional leg length\\" is a widely used chiropractic tool, it is not a recognized anthropometric technique, since legs are often naturally of unequal length, and measurements in the prone position are not entirely valid estimates of standing X-ray differences.D W Rhodes, E R Mansfield, P A Bishop, J F Smith. The validity of the prone leg check as an estimate of standing leg length inequality measured by X-ray. J Manipulative Physiol Ther.; 18 (6):343-6 Measurements in the standing position are far more reliable.E Hanada, R L Kirby, M Mitchell, J M Swuste. Measuring leg-length discrepancy by the \\"iliac crest palpation and book correction\\" method: reliability and validity. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2001 Jul; 82 (7):938-42 Another confounding factor is that simply moving the two legs held together and leaning them imperceptibly to one side or the other produces different results. Alan Alda, PBS. Video discusses Activator and leg length The Activator Methods technique uses leg length checks while prone (Position 1) and with the knees bent to 90 degrees (Position 2). Research shows good intraexaminer reliability and moderate interexaminer reliability with leg length checks in position 1, however no consensus has been met on the accuracy of leg length checks in position 1.  Utilization rates  In 2003, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners found that 69.9% of chiropractors used the technique, and 23.9% of patients received it. The majority of US chiropractic schools and some schools in other countries teach the AMCT method, and an estimated 45,000 chiropractors worldwide use AMCT or some part of the technique.  Results  There have been a number of studies of AMCT, including case reports, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials. A few studies suggest that the activator may be as effective as manual adjustment in treatment of back pain.

September 2005 This allows the player a greater degree of self-expression through freeform play, since they can set up their own goals to achieve.  History  Non-games have existed since the early days of video games, although there hasn't been a specific term for them. One of the first is Atari Inc.’s 1977 Surround, a two-player snake game for the Atari 2600, which contains a free-form drawing mode called \\"Video Graffiti.\\" Later examples which were sold as games but present a less structured experience are Alien Garden (Epyx, 1982), Moondust (Creative Software, 1983), Worms? (one of the 1983 launch titles from Electronic Arts), I, Robot (Atari, 1983) which contains an \\"ungame mode\\" called \\"Doodle City,\\" and Jeff Minter's Psychedelia (Llamasoft, 1984), which is an interactive light synthesizer. Bill Budge's Pinball Construction Set (Electronic Arts, 1983) popularized software where building something is more entertaining than playing the finished product. To a lesser extent, some games became construction sets through the inclusion of level editors, like Doug Smith's Lode Runner (Broderbund, 1983), Ron Rosen's Mr. Robot and His Robot Factory (Datamost, 1983), and John Anderson's Rally Speedway (Adventure International, 1983). Other more proper construction sets followed, such as EA's Adventure Construction Set (1984) and Racing Destruction Set (1985). In January 1984, Joel Gluck presented a simple toy called Bounce in his game design column in ANALOG Computing. Bounce lets users draw low-resolution lines, then release a block that leaves a permanent trail as it moves across the screen, making patterns as it reflects off of obstacles. The program is specifically designed not to have goals or scorekeeping, other than what's in the user's head. Bounce was revisited several times in ANALOG, including a version which allows multiple active blocks at once. The 1989 simulation game SimCity was called a software toy by its creator Will Wright, since there is no ultimate objective in the main game; scenarios with objectives existed in some incarnations of the game, such as SimCity 2000, but these were not the focus.The History of Civilization at GamaSutra Non-games have been particularly successful on the Nintendo DS and Wii platforms, where a broad range of Japanese titles have appealed to a growing number of casual gamers.Gpara.com: non-games sales figures in Japan, May 2007 IGN: Non-Game Flood: Twelve more non games are set for the Japanese DS, July 2006  See also  * Video games as art  References   External links  * gamesindustry.biz: When is a game not a game? * Lost Garden: Nintendogs: The case of the non-game that barked like a game * Qubrix Brain Twister - a 3D combinatorics toy.

It is also an important active metabolite of spironolactone, and partially accounts for its therapeutic effects. Medical uses Canrenone is mainly used as a diuretic. Canrenone has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Canrenone is reportedly more potent as an antimineralocorticoid relative to spironolactone, but is considerably less potent and effective as an antiandrogen. Similarly to spironolactone, canrenone inhibits steroidogenic enzymes such as 11β-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, and 21-hydroxylase, but once again, is comparatively less potent in doing so. =Pharmacokinetics= The elimination half-life of canrenone is about 16.5 hours. =As a metabolite= Canrenone is an active metabolite of spironolactone, canrenoic acid, and potassium canrenoate, and is considered to be partially responsible for their effects. It has been found to account for approximately 10 to 25% of the potassium-sparing effect of spironolactone, whereas another metabolite, 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), accounts for around 80% of the potassium-sparing effect of the drug.

Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 11(1), 3 In conclusion, there is still great controversy surrounding the use of the SVA and many studies have investigated its core component, the CBCA, in order to determine its validity and reliability. More research is needed to conclude whether or not the information obtained from these tests should be admissible in court. Example Statement analysis involves an investigator searching for linguistic cues and gaps in a subject's testimony or preliminary statements. Ideally, the technique would guide investigators to ask follow-up questions to uncover discrepancies. The creator of Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), Avinoam Sapir, gives the example of someone saying, \\"I counted the money, put the bag on the counter, and proceeded to go home.\\" Sapir says the statement was literally true: > He counted the money (when you steal you want to know how much you are > stealing), and then the subject put the bag on the counter. The subject > didn't say that he put the money back in the bag after counting it, because > he didn't; he left the empty bag on the counter and walked away with the > money. Sapir says that a fundamental principle of statement analysis is that \\"denying guilt is not the same as denying the act. When one says 'I am not guilty' or 'I am innocent,' they are not denying the act; they are only denying guilt.\\" Sapir claims that it is almost impossible for a guilty person to say \\"I didn't do it.\\" He asserts that guilty people tend to speak in even greater circumlocutions by saying things like \\"I had nothing to do with it\\" or \\"I am not involved in that\\". Criticism Aldert Vrij, one of the leading authorities on detection of deception (DOD) techniques, points out that most studies of the technique did not rely on the ground truth being established and thus examiners could not be certain if \\"examinees were actually telling the truth or lying\\".Aldert Vrij, Detecting Lies and Deceit: Pitfalls and Opportunities, 2nd ed., Chichester, England: John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p. 290. He also notes that there is no standardization among the different methods of analysis and this \\"implies that much depends on the subjective interpretation and skill of the individual\\" performing the analysis. Vrij attributes this to an absence of theoretical underpinning behind SCAN/statement analysis. Vrij characterizes SCAN/statement analysis as weaker than CBCA because SCAN/statement analysis lacks \\"a set of cohesive criteria\\", being instead \\"a list of individual criteria\\". Vrij argues that SCAN/statement analysis is best used as a technique to guide investigative interviews rather than as a \\"lie detection tool\\".Aldert Vrij, Detecting Lies and Deceit: Pitfalls and Opportunities, 2nd ed., Chichester, England: John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p. 291. Critics argue that the technique encourages investigators to prejudge a suspect as deceptive and affirm a presumption of guilt before the interrogation process has even begun. Statement analysis in general has been criticized as \\"theoretically vague\\" with little or no empirical evidence in its favor, and SCAN in particular has been characterized as \\"junk science\\" with the Skeptic's Dictionary and Skeptical Inquirer magazine\\"Statement Analysis Scan or Scam?\\", by Robert A. Shearer, Skeptical Inquirer, May/June 1999 classifying it as a form of pseudoscience. In 2016, the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG), a federal agency group consisting of the FBI, the CIA, and the United States Department of Defense, released a report which found that studies commonly cited in favor of SCAN were scientifically flawed and that SCAN's evaluative criteria did not withstand scrutiny in laboratory testing.

Part tell-all covering her sexual liaisons with music industry personalities and professional athletes, and part cautionary tale about the dangers of the otherwise romanticized hip-hop music industry, it caused considerable controversy in some circles. Summary Confessions of a Video Vixen recounts Steffans' life from her troubled girlhood living in poverty in St. Thomas, through abuse, drugs, rape and living as a teenage runaway who turns to stripping and hip hop modeling to support herself and, later, her young son. Originally published in 2005 by Amistad, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, the book was immediately a New York Times bestseller. (The 2006 paperback edition includes bonus material, and also made the NYT bestseller list.) The book created a stir when it went on sale because of Steffans' allegations of abuse at the hands of her then-husband rapper, Kool G Rap and her claims that she had sexual relationships with numerous famous music stars and athletes, including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, Bobby Brown, Dr. Dre, DMX, Xzibit, Diddy, Usher, Shaquille O'Neal and Irv Gotti.Inside the List: He Said, She Said; The New York Times; August 14, 2005 Contents *No Shame in My Game *The Sins of the Mother *Flower Off the Bloom *The Great Escape *Breaking Away *Pain Is Love *Around the Block References Further reading * 2005 non-fiction books African-American autobiographies HarperCollins books Literature by African-American women ","title":"Confessions of a Video Vixen"},{"id":"13285916","text":"Roomic Cube (subtitled ...A Tiny Room Exhibition) is the second studio album by Japanese musician Takako Minekawa.

History Narur is named after Nar Chand, one of the sons of Mian Mota, who was a Jaswal prince from the Punjab hills.Rose, Horace Arthur. Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, pg 52. According to village folklore, Narur was founded by a Jaswal prince hailing from Amb, capital of Jaswan, which is located in present day Himachal Pradesh. The prince was hunting in the area and fell in love with a local girl, said to be from a nearby village Ajnoha. The two eventually married and founded the village. Notable Historical Events = Peasant agitation against malba tax = As noted in the Kapurthala gazetteer of 1984,Anju Arora, The princely states: British paramountcy and internal administration, 1858-1948 : a case study of the Kapurthala State \\"In 1938-39, there was a peasant agitation against malba tax, which was being charged at the rate of six per cent of the land revenue. People refused to pay the tax and lambardars expressed their inability to do anything in the matter. The situation became quite grave at village Narur which was described as the storm centre of the agitation. The agitation won a partial victory when the Maharaja granted relief to the tune of rupees thirty thousand out of a total sum of rupees sixty five thousand.\\" It is told by the village elders that when the Kapurthala Maharaja sent his soldiers and tax collectors to Narur, the Jaswals threw rocks at them and fought them otherwise, as briefly hinted at above. The soldiers were pushed back and returned to Kapurthala without making any collections. = The Kisan Sabha protests against the Betterment Levy Tax of 1950s = In 1952, before the completion of Bhakra canal system, the Punjab Government armed itself with a legislation to impose betterment levy, with the aim of meeting all the expenditure on canal system through this tax. According to this legislation, the basis of this tax was to be fifty per cent of the increase in price of land due to the Bhakra canal irrigation system.Post- independence India, Volumes 33-50 By Om Prakash Ralhan, pg. 71 There were protests throughout the state and hundreds of people were arrested in false cases of encounters with the police. On 10 March 1959, Pratab Singh Kairon, the Chief Minister of Punjab, made a statement in state assembly that the communists were trying to take over the state. The next day, on 11 March, police surrounded Narur, which was cited as one of epicenters of revolt, and started firing. Five people, including a woman, laid down their lives.Post- independence India, Volumes 33-50 by Om Prakash Ralhan, pg. 79 The Punjab government eventually failed to suppress the agitation and Pratap Singh Kairon came to Narur. In an effort to appease the villagers, the government opened the primary and middle schools in the village. Since then the villagers have held an annual mela in memory of the five shahids who gave up their lives.

The story was adapted into the 1985 film Desert Hearts, directed by Donna Deitch. The book was originally published in hardback by Macmillan Canada. It was one of the very few novels addressing lesbianism that was published in hardback form; most books during this period with female homosexuality as a topic were considered lesbian pulp fiction until 1969. At the time the novel was published, Rule was a lecturer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and because the novel dealt with sapphic romance, her job was threatened.Heath. Profiles in Canadian Literature. Vol. 7.Dundurn Press Ltd., 1996 Desert of the Heart was first republished in paperback form by Talonbooks in 1977.  Background  Rule's family lived in Reno, Nevada, where the book is set, and although she was not a resident, she visited them. One summer, Rule worked in a casino to research for the book and was impressive in her competence. Rule completed the book in 1961 and spent three years trying to find a publisher for it, eventually sending it to about 25 American publishers. Rule remembered that one publisher told her, \\"If this book isn't pornographic, what's the point of printing it? ... if you can write in the dirty parts we'll take it but otherwise no\\".Hannon, Gerald. Xtra.ca (Toronto). Retrieved November 29, 2007.  Plot summary  Evelyn Hall is an English professor from the University of California. She arrives in Reno to establish a six-week residency to attain a quick divorce, which Nevada was known for at that time. After being married for 15 years, she is overwhelmed with guilt for feeling as if she is ruining her husband's mental health. While in Reno, she stays in the guest home of Frances Packer with other women awaiting their divorces. Frances also lives with Walter, her 18-year-old son and her late lover's 25-year-old daughter, Ann Childs. Evelyn and Ann are startled at how alike they are in appearance, despite their 15-year age difference. Ann works as a change operator at a local casino and as a relatively successful cartoonist. Ann is revealed to reject significant relationships in her life, and although she is romantic with both men and women, she refuses to become attached to anyone. She is ending a relationship with her boss, Bill, that was significant enough to make her friends believe they were to be married. Ann's best friend is Silver, who works with her at the casino as a dealer, and is also a sometime lover. Evelyn and Ann begin a friendship that evolves into a romantic relationship in which Evelyn must deal with her guilt after being asked by her husband's doctor to divorce him for his own good. Despite the symptoms of his deep and chronic depression, Evelyn takes the responsibility for the failure of the marriage and his depression upon herself, but after divulging how caustic she is to Ann, she is relieved to realize that the responsibility is not hers to take. Ann must subsequently deal with committing to a relationship wholeheartedly. Being employed by the casino, she is rather well-paid, but is stifled within the atmosphere there, though she continues to work despite her abilities. Ann is fired from the casino after a slot machine is stolen on her shift when she is distracted by Evelyn being at the casino. Ann's previous split with Bill is not amicable, despite Bill beginning to date another of his employees. There is some suspicion that Bill is spying on Ann and Evelyn, and he threatens to contact Evelyn's husband's lawyer to notify him of Ann and Evelyn's lesbian relationship, but the divorce is finalized without his interference. Immediately after the final hearing, Evelyn and Ann decide to live together \\"for a while.\\"  Origin of the title  The story is set in Reno, Nevada, around which spreads an expanse of desert that initially strikes fear into Evelyn upon her arrival and has been a comfort to Ann during her existence there. It is used to describe Evelyn's lack of knowledge of what real love is, when she tells Ann that she lives \\"in the desert of the heart.\\" After she falls in love with Ann, the desert surrounding Reno ceases to terrify her. Simultaneously, the desert also ceases to comfort Ann as a place to run to be alone. Along with the desert climate as a symbol, the setting of the casino in which Ann works and Evelyn visits is also considered a desert of morality. Ann is witness to what the addiction of gambling does to people of all walks of life, including the employees. Being fired from the casino frees Ann from her refusals to care about what happens to the gambling addicts, dealers, other change aprons, and the casino management, and allows her to commit to a more refined life with Evelyn. The title is taken from a poem by W.H. Auden, his elegy for Yeats. \\"In the desert of the heart, Let the healing fountain start.\\" Evelyn is a professor of English literature, and she quotes from some of Yeats' poems.  Reception  Rule's first novel received warm praise from literary critics who described it as \\"an intelligent novel, not afraid of ideas, and not committed to them overdiagrammatically.\\"Salvesen, Christopher. \\"Desert of the Heart (book review).\\" New Statesman; February 14, 1964. Rule's prose did not sensationalize the relationship between Evelyn and Ann, choosing a detached method of writing. One reviewer noted, \\"Miss Rule is so arbitrary in her depiction of the major characters' psyche-searching and so sketchy in her description of minor figures that the reader is apt to have little empathy with anyone.\\"Bresler, T. \\"Desert of the Heart (book review).\\" Library Journal; June 15, 1965.

Desert of the Heart was highly recommended by Gene Damon in The Ladder, who called it \\"a symbolic delight.\\"Damon, Gene. \\"Lesbiana.\\" Ladder, Jun64, Vol. 8 Issue 9, p12 Rule remembered the mail she got from women who read the book. \\"I got a huge amount of fan mail which I didn't expect.

People were writing things like you are the only person in the world who could possibly understand who I am, how I feel, if I'm not able to talk to someone I'm going to kill myself...it just felt to me overwhelming and depressing that there was so much fear and so much self- hatred and so much loneliness.\\"Bealy, Joanne.

Otto is an anthropomorphism of the color orange and represents the fruit the orange. Wearing a large blue hat and blue pants. Otto can usually be seen at Syracuse sporting events in the Carrier Dome and other university sporting events. Mascot History =Saltine Warrior= The Syracuse mascot was originally a Native American character named \\"The Saltine Warrior\\" (Syracuse's unofficial nickname is the Salt City) and \\"Big Chief Bill Orange\\". The character was born out of a hoax in which it was claimed that a 16th-century Onondogan Indian chief was unearthed while digging the foundation for the women's gymnasium in 1928. In the mid-1950s, the father of a Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity brother owned a cheerleading camp. He made a Saltine Warrior costume for his son to wear at SU football games. Thus began a nearly forty-year tradition of Lambda Chi brothers serving as SU's mascot. In 1990 however the University opened up the mascot traditions to the entire student body (Daily Orange, February 22, 1990).242x242px In 1978, Native American students successfully petitioned the University to discontinue the Saltine Warrior, citing the mascot's stereotypical portrayal of Native Americans. During the 1978 season, the University introduced a Roman gladiator dressed in orange armor, but the idea proved largely unpopular among fans, who regularly booed the mascot. =Otto becomes official= In the 1980s, a new Syracuse University mascot emerged and was described as a \\"juiced-up, bumbling citrus fruit from which two legs protrude\\", and quickly became popular on campus. In the summer of 1990, the cheerleaders and mascots were at Cheerleading Camp in Tennessee and the students who were chosen to suit up in the costume narrowed the field down to two potential names — \\"Opie\\" and \\"Otto\\" — as a new orange costume was made. It was concluded that the name \\"Opie\\" would lead to the inevitable rhyme with 'dopey', and settled on \\"Otto.\\" Later that fall, word got out that the cheerleaders were calling the latest mascot costume Otto, and the name stuck. For 17 years the university did not settle on an \\"official\\" mascot until the chancellor appointed a group of students and faculty to create a mascot and logo. University administration considered introducing a new mascot (a wolf or lion were likely candidates), but the student body supported Otto. He was recognized as the official mascot of Syracuse University by 1995. In 2016, Otto was named in the top-10 mascots in college football by Sports Illustrated. = Mascot Team = There are a team of performers that dress as Otto, this team contains a mix of personalities and genders. Similar body builds are required so not one Otto stands out, performers need to be the desired height of 5 feet and 10 inches. Stunts, dances, gestures and general movement are all practiced and routinized. The Ottos take turns attending events. Otto will never be in two places at once, so the magic of a mascot does not die. So if there are two sporting events happening at the same time, Otto's time will be split between the two events. Social Media 181x181pxIn general, most of Otto’s social media activity happens through pictures and videos. Additionally, he frequently retweets or shares other University pages in order to promote sports games, events such as the career fair, and instilling pride in SU fans. Otto the Orange is active on social networks such as Instagram,https://www.instagram.com/theottoorange/ Twitter,https://twitter.com/TheOttoOrange?lang=en and Facebook.https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=otto%20the%20orange In 2006, a video of a fight between Otto the Orange and the Hokiebird was spread, with many speculating that the fight was the result of pent up anger between the two actors portraying the characters. It was not until 2019 that the person who portrayed Otto at the time confirmed that this was a simulated fight.

Geographical data Morzhovets lies only a few km above the Arctic Circle. This island has an area of . The area where this island is located belongs to the Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russian Federation. Administratively, the island is part of Mezensky District. The island is flat and grassy (covered by tundra) and it has many lakes. The biggest one is Lake Morzhovets. There is a settlement on Morzhovets, Severny Gorodok, which serves the lighthouse and the meteorogical station. The population of the settlement is 12. History Historically, the pomors who populated the coast of the Mezen Bay, were fishing along the coast. A sudden change of the weather could drive them off- shore. In this case, Morzhovets island was the last land before they got driven off to the Barents Sea and perish, and thus was considered to be the last resort. In particular, the father of the Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov, Vasily Lomonosov, died in the sea, and his body was found on the island. Pomor fishermen built a chapel on the island, which did not survive.  Bibliography  * B. Wwedenski et al. Bolschaja sowetskaja enziklopedija: Tom 28.

Henry Russell's San Carlo Opera The first company was founded by impresario Henry Russell, initially as a touring arm of the Teatro di San Carlo of Naples, Italy, in 1904. The company soon became its own institution and toured to The Royal Opera, London, in the Fall of 1905 and Boston in early 1906. The group remained based in Boston and gave tours annually of mostly Italian operas throughout the United States from 1906 to 1909 in addition to giving performances in Boston. With the opening of the Boston Opera House in 1909, the company essentially became the seed for the newly formed Boston Opera Company under the leadership of Russell. Notable singers to perform with Russell's San Carlo Opera Company included sopranos Fély Dereyne, Alice Nielsen, Lillian Nordica, and Tarquinia Tarquini; tenors Florencio Constantino, Riccardo Martin, and Umberto Sacchetti; contralto Rosa Olitzka; and bass Andrés de Segurola. Fortune Gallo's San Carlo Opera The second San Carlo Opera Company was a touring grand opera company founded by the Italian-American impresario Fortune Gallo. Taking over management of a touring opera company led by Mario Lombardi that was stranded in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1910, Gallo brought them back to New York City, untangled their finances, and reorganized them as the San Carlo Opera Company, opening in December 1913 with a premier performance featuring Carmen. Until its disbandment in the mid-1950s, the company – 100 strong, including 30 instrumentalists – toured annually in the United States and Canada, visiting cities and towns poorly served by other companies, and often ventured as far afield as Europe, and South America. Part of Gallo's success was his innovation of using local talent and heavily advertising their use to spur ticket sales. In addition, the company was led under the musical direction of conductor Carlo Peroni from 1921 until his death twenty-three years later. Under Peroni's leadership the company fared well, and in 1927 Gallo built the Gallo Opera House on West 54th Street in New York City. It would later become Studio 54. The San Carlo company holds the distinction of having performed in the very first sound film of a complete opera, Pagliacci, in 1929. Gallo did not try to turn the opera into a \\"moving picture\\", rather this was a filmed stage production, with stage sets, framed by the proscenium arch. During the war years of 1943 and 1944, Gallo produced a full season of opera in Chicago, which had lacked a resident opera company for some years, under the name Chicago Opera Company, using both his San Carlo company and visiting artists. Upon Peroni's death in 1944, Nicola Rescigno assumed the role of music director. He was succeeded in 1947 by Carlo Moresco who served as the company's music director until its demise roughly ten years later.

He wrote 18 published novels. Robertson is probably best known for his trio of novels featuring Morris Bird III: The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread, The Sum and Total of Now, and The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened. A movie adaptation of The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened aired on NBC in 1977, starring Jimmie Walker and James Earl Jones. Early life Robertson was born on March 21, 1929 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Josephine Wuebben Robertson and Carl Trowbridge Robertson, an associate editor of The Plain Dealer. Robertson lived until 1946 on Cleveland's east side, in Hough, and graduated from East High School. Education and early career After stints in the Army and at Harvard and Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University), he became a reporter and columnist for The Plain Dealer (1950-1955 and 1963-1966), The Cleveland News (1957–1959), and The Cleveland Press (1968–1982). He reviewed movies and theater for the NBC's Cleveland affiliate WKYC-TV in the late 1970s and early ’80s, as well as \\"won a following as a no- nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is radio and TV talk show host.\\" He also got involved in live theater. Novels and film Most of Robertson's novels were set in Ohio, and the fictional town of Paradise Falls, Ohio, figured in many of them. Paradise Falls was also the title of one of his longest novels. Additionally, much of Robertson's fiction was set in the recent past, or a few generations past. His 1964 novel A Flag Full of Stars, for instance, was set during the 1948 U.S. elections. Like John O'Hara, Robertson often linked novels that were not substantially related by including brief allusions to characters and events in his previous works. His fascinations with history and human lives were evident from his first novels, a Civil War trilogy (1959–1962). Set in Cleveland between 1944 and 1953, each of the three Morris Bird III novels revolves around a major event in the city’s history: the East Ohio Gas explosion, the Indians winning the pennant, and the Korean War. In 1987, Stephen King’s Philtrum Press published Robertson’s novel, The Ideal, Genuine Man. King has acknowledged Robertson as one of his influences. Crown published Robertson's final novel, Prisoners of Twilight, in 1989. The early title of this book was Companion to Owls. In April 2008, HarperCollins Publisher reissued The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread in paperback. Berkley Trade (a division of Penguin Books) reissued The Sum and Total of Now in August 2009, and HarperCollins Publisher reissued The Greatest Thing that Almost Happened in September 2009. The rest of Don Robertson's books are currently out of print. In 2016 the italian editor Nicola Manuppelli started the italian publication of Robertson's works with the publisher Nutrimenti, translating \\"The Ideal, Genuine Man\\" (Nutrimenti, 2016).https://www.amazon.it/Luomo-autentico-Don-Robertson/dp/8865944609 A second novel by Robertson, \\"Praise the Human Season\\" will be translated by Nicola Manuppelli at the end of 2017. . In 2019, Nicola Manuppelli edited and translated an unpublished Don's novel \\"Julie\\" in Italy for Nutrimenti publisher. The novel is about the character Julie Sutton, known from others Don's works. Awards A Flag Full of Stars (1964), set during the 1948 election of Harry Truman, won the Putnam Award. Robertson won the Cleveland Arts Prize for his Morris Bird books, in 1966. He won the Ohioana Book Award in fiction in 1988 for The Ideal, Genuine Man.The Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature presented him with its Mark Twain Award in 1991. The Press Club of Cleveland's Hall of Fame inducted Robertson in 1992, and he received the Society of Professional Journalist's Life Achievement Award in 1995. Critical reception and legacy Reviewers compared Robertson's first three books - the Civil War trilogy (1959-1962) - to the works of Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington, and J.D. Salinger. The Dictionary of Midwestern Literature pronounced it Robertson’s \\"most significant fictional accomplishment\\" and predicted the three-book saga was \\"likely to assume an important place in American boyhood fiction.\\" In contrast, Robertson's later books were sometimes criticized for their violence and \\"sordid\\" tendencies. Stephen King stated Robertson’s work had been an inspiration to him as a writer, and Robertson was deeply touched when King published \\"the older writer's\\" novel, The Ideal, Genuine Man (1987). King also said, during an interview in 2015, that Robertson was \\"probably\\" his favorite novelist of all- time.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/books/review/stephen-king-by-the- book.html?_r=1 Sportswriter Terry Pluto has said that, \\"Robertson made me believe I could become an author,\\" after one of his high school teachers gave the 14 year-old Pluto a copy of The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread, and telling the young boy that he could write books too.http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2008/08/the_greatest_thing_since_slice.html Personal life and health Dennis Dooley describes Robertson thusly: \\"A battler who fought his way back, with the help of his wife Sherri, from a series of crushing health problems—two heart attacks in 1974, several strokes, lung cancer and the eventual loss of both legs to diabetes—Robertson liked to refer to the nine novels he published after 1974 as his \\"posthumous\\" books.\\" [...] \\"Wheelchair-bound but hard at work on another book (he relished a new software program that simulated the printed page), he told two departing fellow writers who had dropped by to see him shortly before his death, 'Hey, don’t forget me, you guys.'\\" Death Robertson died at home of lung cancer on his birthday in 1999, aged 70.

The public square is located between the north-south 3rd and 4th Streets and between the east-west Main and Columbia Streets. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is located in the Downtown Lafayette Historic District. History When the county was first organized in 1826, rooms were rented in which to conduct county business, until 1829 when the first courthouse was built; it was a two-story brick building. It was replaced by a larger brick building in 1845 at a cost of about $3,000; there was a fire in this building in the 1840s, but it was extinguished before it could do any damage. The third and current courthouse was built on the site from 1881 to 1884 at a cost of about $500,000. It is built of Indiana limestone and is two-and-a-half stories tall on a raised basement. Architecturally, it is a pastiche of styles including Second Empire, Beaux Arts, Baroque, Rococo, Georgian and Neo-Classical. Paul Goeldner in his study of Midwestern courthouses called the building the \\"epitome of county capitals\\". Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The old courthouse, built in 1845 When Samuel Clemens visited Lafayette he was asked his opinion about the Tippecanoe County Courthouse by a local newspaper reporter; Clemens replied: \\"Striking, striking indeed! It must have struck the taxpayers a mighty blow!\\" The comment was accurate as this was the most expensive courthouse built in the state until the Allen County Courthouse was built some twenty years later. The courthouse has one hundred columns, nine statues, an elongated dome with four clock faces and a bell tuned to C-sharp. A 14-foot statue depicting liberty tops the courthouse dome at a height of 212 feet.

The island's English population at the time totaled several hundred, and the native Wampanoag outnumbered them by at least three to one. Built as a wedding gift for Jethro Coffin (1663–1727) and Mary Gardner (1670–1767), the house represents the unity of two of the island's oldest families. Jethro was the grandson of one of the island's original proprietors, Tristram Coffin, and Mary was the daughter of John Gardner, one of the leaders of the so-called Half-Share Revolt, in which the island's tradesmen rallied against the wealthier full-share proprietors. Although the relationship between Gardner and Coffin was never amicable, the marriage of Mary and Jethro helped unite the families and soothe old wounds. Built on Gardner land using Coffin lumber, the house is a physical manifestation of this unity. By the late nineteenth century, the house was abandoned and had fallen into disrepair, but a Coffin family reunion held on the island in 1881 ignited renewed interest in the property. The NHA acquired the house in 1923, and four years later, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA, now Historic New England), commenced an extensive reconstruction in an attempt to return the house to its historic appearance. The Oldest House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. In 1987, it was struck by lightning, which caused extensive damage necessitating substantial repairs to and partial reconstruction of the roof and chimney. Today, the house stands as a monument to the lives of the island's earliest English settlers and offers visitors a glimpse of daily life on Nantucket in the seventeenth century. It is now a historic house museum owned and operated by the Nantucket Historical Association. It is also a contributing element of the Nantucket Historic District, a National Historic Landmark District. Kitchen garden Efforts have been made to restore the landscape surrounding the Oldest House to an appearance more appropriate to its historic setting. The kitchen garden, located behind the house, is a reconstruction of a circa-1700 herb and vegetable garden and is maintained without the use of modern fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides. Plants are grown in a raised-bed system typical of the time and include common vegetable staples such as carrots, onions, cabbages, and parsnips, as well as approximately thirty varieties of herbs grown for culinary, medicinal, or household use. Detailed history Mary lived on Sunset Hill for about twenty years. Although the date of construction of the house is not known exactly, tradition says that it was built as a wedding present for the couple in 1686, when sixteen-year-old Mary married twenty-three-year-old Jethro Coffin. Like the view from the house, the dwelling itself had a different appearance in the seventeenth century, although we can't be certain exactly what it was. It was an impressive house for its time, two stories in height on the south-facing front facade, with a long, sloping north roof sometimes called a “catslide,” which may be an original feature. Massive fireplaces were the dominant features of the rooms on each floor: the parlor on the west side, the hall, or great room, on the east, and the lean-to kitchen in the rear, under the low-hanging roof. Two chambers, or bedrooms, were on the second floor, with an attic above. Physical evidence indicates that the center-chimney dwelling originally featured twin front gables that allowed light into the second-floor rooms, and from that height on the hill the Coffins and their children could see for miles. Mary and Jethro sold their Nantucket dwelling to Nathaniel Paddack in 1708 and moved to Mendon, Massachusetts, when Jethro inherited property there. Although the Oldest House is closely associated with Mary and Jethro Coffin, four generations of the Paddack family lived there. Many of them were mariners, reflecting Nantucket's change from an agricultural to a maritime community in the eighteenth century. In 1839, George Paddack sold the house out of the family to a cooper named George Turner for $300, ending a hundred and thirty- one years of Paddack ownership. By 1867, George and Mary Turner found another place to live, and the ancient nuptial dwelling of Jethro and Mary Coffin was used as a hay barn. In 1881, two off-island members of the Coffin family purchased the Jethro Coffin house from the Turner family for $300. Repairs were made and the house was opened up in 1886 for its 200th anniversary, then settled down for a long sleep until 1897, when it was opened in the summers as a house museum. The house attracted a constant stream of curious visitors eager to peer into a relic of the early history of the island. The Nantucket Historical Association purchased Jethro and Mary's dwelling from Tristram Coffin in 1923. Winthrop Coffin of Boston — another off-island descendant of the original Tristram — stepped up to fund restoration of the house and his architect of choice, Alfred F. Shurrocks, began the work in 1927. Although Shurrocks determined that the house had originally had twin front gables, a decision was made to restore the structure to its more familiar appearance and to replace eighteenth-century double-hung sash windows with diamond-paned casements, which they felt more suited a seventeenth-century dwelling. The Jethro Coffin house was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior in 1968. On October 1, 1987, lightning struck the house, toppling the chimney, destroying half of the roof, and melting the electrical wiring, causing damage that required two years (and about a million dollars) to painstakingly mend. The stalwart old structure was so solidly built that since restoration it has continued to hold firm on Sunset Hill where it tells the story of the early English settlement of Nantucket in the seventeenth century.

Gutheil, 1904) No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 No. 4 No. 6 No. 7 No. 8 No. 9 No. 10 Ten Preludes, Op. 23, is a set of ten preludes for solo piano, composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff in 1901 and 1903. This set includes the famous Prelude in G minor. Together with the Prelude in C minor, Op. 3/2 and the 13 Preludes, Op. 32, this set is part of a full suite of 24 preludes in all the major and minor keys.  Composition  Op. 23 is composed of ten preludes, ranging from two to five minutes in length. Combined, the pieces take around thirty minutes to perform. They are: * No. 1 in F minor (Largo) * No. 2 in B major (Maestoso) * No. 3 in D minor (Tempo di minuetto) * No. 4 in D major (Andante cantabile) * No. 5 in G minor (Alla marcia) * No. 6 in E major (Andante) * No. 7 in C minor (Allegro) * No. 8 in A major (Allegro vivace) * No. 9 in E minor (Presto) * No. 10 in G major (Largo) Rachmaninoff completed Prelude No. 5 in 1901. The remaining preludes were completed after Rachmaninoff's marriage to his cousin Natalia Satina: Nos. 1, 4, and 10 premiered in Moscow on February 10, 1903, and the remaining seven were completed soon thereafter.Norris, Geoffrey, Rachmaninoff, pg. 170 Schirmer Books (1993). 1900–1903 were difficult years for Rachmaninoff and his motivation for writing the Preludes was predominantly financial.Lamagra, Anthony J., A Source Book for the Suty of Rachmaninoff's 'Preludes', Ed.D. dissertation, Columbia University (Publication No. AAT 6702817). Rachmaninoff composed the works in the Hotel America, financially dependent on his cousin Alexander Siloti, to whom the Preludes are dedicated.  Analysis  Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes abandon the traditional short prelude form delineated by composers such as Bach, Scriabin, and Chopin. Unlike Chopin's set, some half-page musical fragments, Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes last for several minutes each, expanding into complex polyphonic forms with musically independent sections. The pieces perhaps represent a culmination of the Romantic idiom.Lamagra, Anthony J., A Source Book for the Suty of Rachmaninoff's 'Preludes', Ed.D. dissertation, Columbia University (Publication No. AAT 6702817), p.232. The set reflects Rachmaninoff's experience as a virtuoso pianist and master composer, testing the \\"...technical, tonal, harmonic, rhythmic, lyrical, and percussive capabilities of the piano.\\" The popular Prelude in C minor, Op. 3, No. 2 perhaps unfairly eclipses the Op. 23 Preludes. Rachmaninoff remarked, \\"...I think the Preludes of Op. 23 are far better music than my first Prelude, but the public has shown no disposition to share in my belief....\\" Sergi Bertensson and Jay Leyda, Sergei Rachmaninoff: A Lifetime in Music, NYU Press, p.162 (1956). The composer never played all of the Preludes in one sitting, preferring to cycle through a rotating mix of his favorites.Martyn, Barrie, Rachmaninoff: Composer, Pianist, Conductor', Scholar Press (1990).' Nonetheless, certain characteristics of the work, such as the recurrence of stepwise motion, common chords between adjacent preludes, and the bookended relationship between the first and last preludes (both marked Largo, with the latter in the parallel major of the former) suggest that the works could be played as a set. Together with Op. 32 and Op. 3, Rachmaninoff's Preludes represent all twenty-four major and minor keys.Martyn, Barrie, Rachmaninoff: Composer, Pianist, Conductor', p. 148, Scholar Press (1990).' From a performance standpoint, the ten Op. 23 Preludes exhibit wide variations in difficulty. Nos. 1, 4, 5, and 10 are conceivably in reach of the \\"advanced-intermediate\\" pianist, while the endurance and dexterity demanded by nos. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and – above all – 9, require more advanced skill. Nonetheless, even the \\"easier\\" preludes present subtle interpretive challenges in counterpoint, dynamic control, and timing, putting true mastery of the pieces out of reach to all but those with virtuosic skill.  Reception  The Ten Preludes, along with the Op. 3 prelude and the Thirteen Preludes of Op. 32, are considered to be among Rachmaninoff's best works for solo piano. The \\"Russian\\" quality of the Op. 23 preludes is often noted by listeners: after hearing Boris Asafyev play the preludes, the painter Ilya Repin noted a streak of Russian nationalism and originality in rhythm and melody. At the same recital, Vladimir Stasov praised the characteristic \\"Rachmaninoff sound\\" and unusual and innovative bell-like quality of the pieces, and Maxim Gorky simply noted, \\"How well he hears the silence.\\"  Music editions  Most editions of the Op. 23 Preludes contain significant editorial distortions in dynamics and phrasing. In 1986, Ruth Laredo set out to produce the first authentic version but was unable to obtain the original manuscripts. The Piano Quarterly praised Laredo's editorial practices, remarking that, \\"this seems to be the edition to own.\\" However, in 1992, Boosey & Hawkes published an edition edited by Robert Threlfall, who had managed to obtain access to the original manuscripts. This edition is widely regarded as the first truly authentic version.Cunningham, Robert, Jr., Sergei Rachmaninoff: A Bio-Bibliography, Greenwood Press (2001).

She was part of the Calliope group of the C class. Construction Eight light cruisers were ordered for the Royal Navy in the 1913 budget. The six ships of the Caroline class used conventional direct- drive turbine engines but two, Champion and , had experimental engine designs using geared reduction to match optimum working speeds of turbines and propellers. This followed experimental designs ordered in 1911 using geared high-pressure turbines for the destroyers and and in 1912 using gearing for both high-pressure and low-pressure turbines in the destroyers and . Champion and Calliope tested different designs.Brown p.24-25 Built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at Tyneside, England, Champion was laid down on 9 March 1914, launched on 29 May 1915, and completed in December 1915.Gardiner, Robert, ed., Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1985, , , , p. 57, (preview of 2006 reprint). Champion had two propeller shafts, the port one being driven from the sternmost engine room and the starboard one from forward. Gearing increased overall engine efficiency, allowing a reduction in boiler and turbine size for a given force provided by the propellers, so the initial design reduced the boiler room size and dropped the nominal developed power from 40,000 shaft horsepower (shp) (29.8 megawatts/MW) to 37,500 shp (28.0 MW). However, during construction modifications were made to again increase boiler capacity and add cruising turbines which returned to the nominal power output of the Caroline class ungeared ships. Maximum propeller speed was a nominal 340 revolutions per minute. Trials comparing Champion to Caroline showed that at actual developed power of 41,000 shp (30.6 MW) in both ships, Champion achieved a speed of 29.5 knots using 470 tons of fuel per day, while Caroline achieved 29 knots using 550 tons of fuel per day. The ship could achieve 28 knots operating at the lower power of 31,000 shp (23.1 MW).

It is the first of three \\"Dresden pieces\\", along with Symphony No. 2 and part of an opera, which were composed in the quiet city of Dresden, Germany. It was originally inspired by Goethe's tragic play Faust; although Rachmaninoff abandoned the idea soon after beginning composition, traces of this influence can still be found. After numerous revisions and substantial cuts made at the advice of his colleagues, he completed it on April 11, 1908. Konstantin Igumnov gave the premiere in Moscow on October 17, 1908. It received a lukewarm response there, and remains one of the least performed of Rachmaninoff's works. It has three movements, and takes about 35 minutes to perform. The sonata is structured like a typical Classical sonata, with fast movements surrounding a slower, more tender second movement. The movements feature sprawling themes and ambitious climaxes within their own structure, all the while building towards a prodigious culmination. Although this first sonata is a substantial and comprehensive work, its successor, Piano Sonata No. 2 (Op. 36), written five years later, became the better regarded of the two. Nonetheless, it, too, was given serious cuts and opinions are mixed about those.  Background  In November 1906, Rachmaninoff, with his wife and daughter, moved to Dresden primarily to compose a second symphony to diffuse the critical failure of his first symphony, but also to escape the distractions of Moscow. There they lived a quiet life, as he wrote in a letter, \\"We live here like hermits: we see nobody, we know nobody, and we go nowhere. I work a great deal,\\" but even without distraction he had considerable difficulty in composing his first piano sonata, especially concerning its form. The original idea for it was to be a program sonata based on the main characters of the tragic play Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: Faust, Gretchen, and Mephistopheles, and indeed it nearly parallels Franz Liszt's own Faust Symphony which is made of three movements which reflect those characters. However, the idea was abandoned shortly after composition began, although the theme is still clear in the final version. Rachmaninoff enlisted the help of Nikita Morozov, one of his classmates from Anton Arensky's class back in the Moscow Conservatory, to discuss how the sonata rondo form applied to his sprawling work. At this time he was invited, along with Alexander Glazunov, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Alexander Scriabin, and Feodor Chaliapin, to a concert in Paris the following spring held by Sergei Diaghilev to soothe France–Russia relations, although Diaghilev hated his music. Begrudgingly, Rachmaninoff decided to attend only for the money, since he would have preferred to spend time on this and his Symphony No. 2 (his opera project, Monna Vanna, had been dropped). Writing to Morozov before he left in May 1907, he expressed his doubt in the musicality of the sonata and deprecated its length, even though at this time he had completed only the second movement. On returning to his Ivanovka estate from the Paris concert, he stopped in Moscow to perform an early version of the sonata to contemporaries Nikolai Medtner, Georgy Catoire, Konstantin Igumnov, and Lev Conus. With their input, he shortened the original 45-minute-long piece to around 35 minutes. He completed the work on April 11, 1908. Igumnov gave the premiere of the sonata on October 17, 1908, in Moscow, and he gave the first performance of the work in Berlin and Leipzig as well, although Rachmaninoff missed all three of these performances.  Composition  Movement 1. The piece is structured as a typical sonata in the Classical period: the first movement is a long Allegro moderato (moderately quick), the second a Lento (very slow), and the third an Allegro molto (very fast). # Allegro moderato (in D minor, ends in D major) #:The substantial first movement Allegro moderato presents most of the thematic material and motifs revisited in the later movements. #:Juxtaposed in the intro is a motif revisited throughout the movement: a quiet, questioning fifth answered by a defiant authentic cadence, followed by a solemn chord progression. This densely thematic expression is taken to represent the turmoil of Faust's mind. #:The movement closes quietly in D major. # Lento (in F major) #:In key, the movement pretends to start in D major before settling in the home key of F major. Although the shortest in length and performance time, the second movement Lento provides technical difficulty in following long melodic lines, navigating multiple overlapping voices, and coherently performing the detailed climax, which includes a small cadenza. # Allegro molto (in D minor) #:Ending the sonata is the furious third movement Allegro molto. Lacking significant thematic content, the movement serves rather to exploit the piano's character, not without expense of sonority. The very first measures of the first movement are revisited, and then dissolves into the enormous climax, a tour de force replete with full- bodied chords typical of Rachmaninoff, which decisively ends the piece in D minor.  Reception  Rachmaninoff played early versions of the piece to Oskar von Riesemann (who later became his biographer), who did not like it. Konstantin Igumnov expressed interest upon first hearing it in Moscow, and following his suggestion Rachmaninoff cut about 110 bars. The sonata had a mediocre evaluation after Igumnov's premiere in Moscow. Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov had died several months previously, and the burden of heading Russian classical music had fallen on this all-Rachmaninoff programme of October 17, 1908. Although the concert, which also included Rachmaninoff's Variations on a Theme of Chopin (Op. 22, 1903), was \\"filled to overflowing\\", one critic called the sonata dry and repetitive, however redeeming the interesting details and innovative structures were. Lee-Ann Nelson, via her 2006 dissertation, noted that Rachmaninoff's revisions are always cuts, with the material simply excised and discarded. The hypothesis is that the frequency of negative responses to many of his pieces, not just the response to the first symphony, led to a deep insecurity, particularly with regard to length. The musicologists Efstratiou and Martyn argued against, for instance, the cuts made to the second sonata on a formal basis. Unlike other pieces, such as the second piano sonata and the fourth piano concerto, no uncut version of this piece is currently known to be extant. Today the sonata remains less well- known than Rachmaninoff's second sonata, and is not as frequently performed or recorded. Champions of the work tend to be pianists renowned for their large repertoire. It has been recorded by Eteri Andjaparidze, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Boris Berezovsky, Idil Biret, Sergio Fiorentino, Leslie Howard, Ruth Laredo, Valentina Lisitsa, Nikolai Lugansky, Olli Mustonen, John Ogdon, Michael Ponti, Santiago Rodriguez, Alexander Romanovsky, Howard Shelley, Daniil Trifonov, Xiayin Wang, and Alexis Weissenberg. Lugansky performs the piece regularly.

The exposition begins with the first theme, which has a descending arpeggio that ends with a low B-flat octave followed by a B-flat minor chord. The first theme area lasts until a cadenza- like passage creates a bridge into the second theme area. The second theme is in D-flat major, with a chorale-like texture that contrasts with the brilliance of the first theme. In the development section, which is split into three parts, there is much tonal instability with constantly changing key centers. Parts of this section use the left hand to imitate bells, with chromatic descending, alternating sevenths and thirds. The recapitulation restates the first two themes in B-flat minor. The final section of an extension to the recapitulation alternates between B-flat major and B-flat minor, leaving the tonic unclear until the coda. The coda, clearly in B-flat minor, repeats two themes seen earlier in the movement. Second Movement (Non allegro) The second movement of the Piano Sonata is in two-part ternary form. A seven-measure interlude in G major links the first and second movements, after which there is a relative minor key area (E minor). The second movement's main theme is based on a motive of a sequentially repeated falling third. The second movement references material from the first movement, which is the first instance of cyclic unity in the sonata. For example, in the middle-section of this movement, the bell texture from the first movement is reestablished. Third Movement (Allegro molto) The third movement begins with a repetition of the interlude to the second movement, with the meter shifted from 4/4 to 3/4. This movement, again in sonata-allegro form, further utilizes cyclic unity by using themes from the first movement. The transition to the second theme area of the exposition introduces a new theme (in D major), unusual in sonata-allegro form. The development section, as in the first movement, is also split into three sub- sections. Similar to the exposition, it uses themes from the first movement in addition to the new themes introduced in the exposition. The recapitulation is in B-flat major, and states the first theme from the third movement only once. It utilizes another past theme expansively to lead toward the coda. The coda utilizes themes from the first movement and is highly chromatic and brilliant. = Revised edition = When Rachmaninoff performed the piece at its premiere in Moscow, it was well received. However, Rachmaninoff himself was not satisfied with the work and felt that too much in the piece was superfluous. Thus, in 1931, he commenced work on a revision. Major cuts were made to the middle sections of the second and third movements and all three sections of the first movement, and some technically difficult passages were simplified. A performance of the original version lasts approximately 25 minutes, while a performance of the revised version lasts approximately 19 minutes. = Horowitz's revision = In 1940, with the composer's consent, Vladimir Horowitz created his own edition which combined elements of both the original and revised versions. His edition used more original material than revised throughout all three movements. A performance of the Horowitz revision lasts approximately 22 minutes.

The character subsequently appears in Sub-Mariner #12-13 (April-May 1969), #32 (December 1970), and #36 (April, 1976). Fictional character biography Karthon is a member of the scaly-skinned subspecies of Homo mermanus called Lemurians. He served Naga as the foremost of his \\"Questers\\", searching on behalf of the undersea kingdom of Lemuria to retrieve the legendary Serpent Crown, which had been lost beneath the sea by Paul Destine. Namor found the Crown at the same time as Karthon.Sub-Mariner #9 The two fought over the Serpent Crown. Karthon told Namor that the Crown would allow the Lemurians to conquer the world, but Namor revealed to Karthon that the Crown was actually a vessel empowered by the demonic Elder God Set. As the two fought, Captain Barracuda and his crew inadvertently captured them in an electrified net. Namor broke free and fought Barracuda's forces, while Karthon took the Serpent Crown and fled back towards Lemuria.Sub-Mariner #10 Namor managed to catch up with Karthon and the two continued to fight over it until Karthon subdued Namor and subverted his will. The two traveled to Lemuria, where Karthon returned the Serpent Crown to Naga. Naga ordered Namor's death, and when Karthon refused to murder him, Naga struck Karthon down using the Serpent Crown and sent the other Questers to attack Namor. Namor collapsed the royal chamber over Naga's throne.Sub-Mariner #12 Karthon tried to hold back the vengeful Namor, who tossed both Karthon and the other Questers aside. Karthon asked Naga to stay his hand against Namor, and Naga instead obliterated the other Questers. The despondent Karthon asked Naga to destroy him as well, but Naga wished to keep Karthon as his enforcer. When Naga caused the death of Karthon's sister Llyna, Karthon became enraged by this final betrayal and slew Naga from behind with his sword. Karthon nearly fell to the evil call of the Serpent Crown, but Namor placed the Crown on Naga's corpse, which was then pulled into a great fissure which opened in the ocean floor.Sub-Mariner #13 The Lemurians proclaimed Karthon their new king, and he accepted, vowing to end Lemuria's history of despotic rulers.

The opera building was designed by the Armenian architect Alexander Tamanian. It consists of two concert halls: the Aram Khatchaturian concert hall with 1,400 seats and the Alexander Spendiaryan Opera and Ballet National Theatre with 1,200 seats. History The ground-breaking of the Opera-Theatre took place on 28 November 1930 during the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of Soviet Armenia. On January 20, 1933, the building was officially opened. Soon after the theatre foundation, a ballet troupe was established. Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was the first ballet performance in 1935. Based on Tamanian's design and under the supervision of his son the theatre hall was completed in 1939, and the opera building was renamed after Alexander Spendiaryan. Large-scale construction works did not finish until 1953, when the entire building was finally completed with its current shape. The opening of the theatre promoted the creation of new national operas and ballets. The first Armenian ballet was Happiness by Aram Khachaturian. On the basis of this ballet the composer soon created Gayane which has been performed all over the world. Many other Armenian composers have written operas and ballets. Over the years, these artists have worked at the theatre: singers Gohar Gasparyan, Tatevik Sazandaryan, Mihran Yerkat, Pavel Lisitsian, Haykanush Danielyan, Nar Hovhannisyan, Gegham Grigoryan, Anahit Mekhitarian; conductors Konstantin Sarajev, Michael Tavrizyan, Aram Katanyan, Karen Durgaryan, Gianluca Marciano, Yuri Davtyan; ballet masters A. Petrosyan, M. Chmshkyan, Vanush Khanamiryan, Vilen Galstyan, Rudolf Kharatyan; painters Martiros Saryan, Minas Avetisyan. Since 1935 a unique Armenian opera, Anoush by Armen Tigranian, has been performed in Yerevan opera theatre. It was a great step in Armenian opera history. Anoush is in the repertoire of the theatre until now. One of sopranos currently performing this role is Mary Movsisyan. Since it was opened, the Armenian National Opera & Ballet Theatre has performed more than 200 different operas and ballets by Armenian, Russian and Western European composers. The theatre company has performed in more than 20 countries, e.g. in Russia, Spain, Lebanon, United States, Greece, Germany. In 1956, the theatre received the status of National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre. The theatre has also hosted concerts performed by Charles Aznavour, Ian Anderson, John McLaughlin, Akvarium and many others.

Biography  Jacob studied in the Rabbinical Seminary and University of his native Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). He served as a rabbi between the years 1891-1929 until he retired to Hamburg to concentrate on his exegetical work. Already in his student years he was active in the fight against antisemitism, he founded a Jewish student's society that introduced fencing duels as a method of defending the honor of Judaism when it was degraded by antisemitic students. In 1892 he had a confrontation with Liebermann von Sonnenberg, a prominent antisemitic politician and publisher. After Sonnenberg delivered a two and a half hour lecture on the Talmud, Jacob, bearing a copy of the Talmud, challenged him to read out the passages he had referred to in his lecture. When Sonnenberg admitted that he could not read even a letter of the Hebrew language, Jacob chided him for speaking about a book which he could not even read and delivered an impromptu lecture of his own refuting the arguments previously advanced. After this pattern was repeated a few more times Liebermann von Sonnenberg was forced to cancel his tour. Jacob was also an active author and orator in the fight against German antisemitism in the years following World War I. He opposed Zionism not only because of his belief in a Jewish-German synthesis, but also because he saw in Zionism a complete secularization of Judaism and a basis for Jewish atheism.  Biblical Studies  Benno Jacob was a scholarly liberal rabbi (with a University degree in Semitics) in Germany until World War II. Before leaving Germany, he produced a monumental commentary on Genesis. Recently, a German edition of his commentary on Exodus has been published. Generally, Jacob is linked with Umberto Cassuto as one of the great twentieth-century opponents of the Documentary Hypothesis. Jacob was not a fundamentalist and did not believe in Mosaic authorship. His rejection of the Documentary Hypothesis was based on his sense that the Pentateuch presents so much literary unity and spiritual harmony that a search for its \\"sources\\" could only be an exercise in futile hypothesis. Melding a traditionalist (if not traditional) view of the Torah with a knowledge of Semitics and applying a Germanic thoroughness to his conviction that no word in the Torah is out of place, he produced two commentaries which attempt to explain nearly every nuance of every word in the Bible. The programmatic statement in his 1916 book, Quellenscheiden und Exegese im Pentateuch, illustrates his concerns: > [The Bible’s] means of representation may be termed the semi-poetic or > dichotomistic. It proceeds like poetry, but without its strict measure > [i.e., meter], employing instead paired thoughts, patterns of words and > clauses and syntax, in doublets, parallels and contrasts; it is rooted, when > all is said and done, in the Semitic [way of thought], which grasps matters > dichotomously. This manner of seeing, conceiving and representing dominates > the Hebrew language and literature in its entirety, to its subtlest > manifestations.  Bibliography  *Das erste Buch der Tora, Genesis.

She is better known under her previous ring name , under which she worked mainly for the Kaientai Dojo and Osaka Pro Wrestling promotions. Professional wrestling career She debuted on January 14, 2002, in Puerto Rico against another Kaientai Dojo wrestler, Ofune. While Ofune was becoming the promotion's top female wrestler, Apple sat back and was in the middle of the card, wrestling in more comedy matches while slowly getting over and gaining more experience. She also worked for JDStar, where she gained even more valuable experience. When Ofune was injured in 2005, Apple was brought into a more prominent role, first gaining the respect of fellow K-Dojo wrestler YOSHIYA, the final match of their series being a hardcore match. They teamed up from then, as the once defunct WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship were brought back into use, and they became the first team to hold them. Apple was also the first female wrestler to hold one of the belts, and the first woman in Kaientai Dojo to hold a belt, something replicated only once by Tomoka Nakagawa. Apple fused her high-flying offense with the hardcore style, and she was quickly over with the fans, taking bumps that women would not normally take. At the end of 2005, Apple and YOSHIYA were awarded the K-AWARD for best Tag Match that year. 2006 saw Apple's hot run continue, with a shot at the UWA Middleweight Title against then champion PSYCHO, although she was defeated. In late 2006, however, things became a little rocky for Apple, as she was turned on by YOSHIYA during a 3-way tag match for the WEW Hardcore Tag Titles, who then created the group \\"Omega\\" with Makoto Oishi, Shiori Asahi, Bambi, and MIYAWAKI. Apple originally declared war on YOSHIYA, but then changed her focus to Bambi, one of the other girls on the roster. With Bambi injured, Apple then took a break from the war against Omega to team with the rookies, adding star power that would not normally be there. 2007 saw a change for Apple, as with GET and RAVE being combined together. She had a small feud with Yu Yamagata to see who was the top women's wrestler in K-Dojo. They had two matches against each other, splitting them both, before throwing away their differences, and they have yet to have had a third singles match. In March 2013, Miyuki announced that she was joining the new Ryukyu Dragon Pro Wrestling promotion, adopting the new ring name Hibiscus Mii in the process.

It is owned by Nestlé Purina PetCare Company, a subsidiary of Nestlé global. Friskies was initially introduced by Carnation Company in the 1930s as a dog food brand. When Friskies cat food was introduced in the 1950s, it was the first dry pet food product specifically for cats. The brand was acquired by Nestlé in 1985. From the 1970s to the 2000s, variations in Friskies cat food proliferated as the competition for consumer spending intensified. Corporate  Friskies is produced and marketed by Nestlé Purina Petcare, a subsidiary of Nestlé. Friskies was first introduced in the 1930s by Carnation through its subsidiary, Albers Company. By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time Carnation was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with dry food products for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel. Carnation International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's pet food products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others. Carnation was acquired by Nestlé in 1985 for $3 billion. After the acquisition, it was renamed Nestlé/Carnation Food Company, before becoming a Nestlé subsidiary in 1992, under the name Friskies PetCare Company. The Friskies brand had a market-share of 28.2% by 1992. Friskies was merged with Nestlé subsidiary Nestlé Purina Petcare in 2001, during the merger with former competitor Ralston Purina. History Friskies was first introduced as a dry dog food brand in 1934. It introduced \\"Friskies Cubes\\" that year, which was followed by pellets called \\"Friskies Meal,\\" eight years later. Friskies sold well as a dry dog food on the west coast of the United States; then was increasingly distributed on the east coast. Only dry food was initially produced, because consumers preferred less expensive products during the Great Depression and World War II led to the rationing of tin for canned pet foods, in order to preserve metal for the war effort. The rationing of tin led to a growth in sales of Friskies dry food products, as competitors that sold canned foods were forced to limit production. The first Friskies brand canned dog food was released in 1951 and nine Friskies products were released from 1958 to 1963. When Friskies cat food was introduced in the 1950s, cats were becoming more popular as pets, but dry food for cats had not been introduced yet. In the early 1950s, a series of specialty dog food products were introduced under the Friskies brand, including one for puppies and cats. According to The Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands, \\"it was soon discovered that cats disliked the new 'puppy food'.\\" A sales manager named Henry Arnest was considered \\"eccentric\\" for advocating that Friskies make a pet food specifically for cats. According to Arnest, the company thought it was \\"a nutty idea.\\" He convinced Friskies executives to do a market trial for cat food, which was conducted on the west coast of the United States in 1956. The cat food was made of mackerel byproducts, cereals, vegetables and vitamins. The trial surprised Friskies executives when the cat food sold successfully. The cat food product was named \\"Little Friskies for Cats.\\" A cartoon cat was used as its mascot. It was advertised on television, newspapers, and through Friskies Research Digest, a publication for veterinarians and animal breeders published by Friskies. Canned \\"treats\\" for cats were first test-marketed in 1958. They were initially popular on the west coast of the United States, but not in the east. In 1959, Carnation executives considered withdrawing from the east coast market, because its cat food products weren't popular there, but decided to stay. A Carnation report found that consumers preferred more upscale, single-serving food products, so the treats were rebranded as single-serving, canned foods called \\"Friskies Buffet\\" in 1967. Buffet became one of Friskies' best-sellers. In the 1970s and 1980s, Friskies-brand food products were introduced in the \\"gourmet\\" industry category, such as Bright Eyes and Chef's Blend. A sister brand Mighty Dog was introduced in 1973, and another sister brand Fancy Feast was produced in 1982. By 1985, Friskies' producer, Ralston Purina, was the largest manufacturer of pet food with a 14.5 percent market-share. Dry and wet food products specifically for kittens were introduced in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Fresh Catch, which contained only fish, was introduced in the early 1990s. According to industry analysts, competition in the pet food industry heightened by 1990. According to The Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands, the market was at \\"a virtual saturation point\\" with more than 400 pet food products on the market. Friskies was one of six brands that controlled 80 percent of the pet food market and competed intensely with one another. Advertising and endorsements Grumpy Cat (aka Tardar Sauce), a Friskies spokescat Starting in 2011, Friskies has been developing digital games for cats on mobile devices that are played using touch-screens. Some of its early games included Cat Fishing, JitterBug and Pull 'n Play, which each focused on chasing moving targets on the screen. According to Adweek, Friskies \\"jumped on the cat Internet meme phenomena.\\" The internet celebrity cat, Grumpy Cat (also known as Tardar Sauce), became a Friskies spokescat in 2013 after having been featured in episodes of the Friskies YouTube game show \\"Will Kitty Play With It?\\" That same year, Friskies created a series of four Henri, le Chat Noir short films on the subject of \\"cat food boredom\\" and several internet celebrity cats were used in a Christmas music video called \\"It's Hard to Be a Cat at Christmas\\". In 2014, Friskies created a satire in partnership with The Fine Bros., whereby they filmed reaction videos of cats watching web series' created by Friskies. Later that same year, Friskies started \\"The Friskies 50\\", a list of the most influential internet cats. The list is based on the cat's audience and engagement on social media sites, media coverage and other factors. Users can also input a cat name to see how cats that did not make the list compare. At the 2015 South by Southwest Interactive festival, Friskies promoted its bacon- flavored cat food with a bacon/cat-themed art gallery, some of which were constructed using Friskies products and bacon. In 2016, Friskies worked with BuzzFeed to create \\"Dear Kitten\\" videos, where an older cat teaches a younger one how to be a house-cat. The series had more than 30 million views. A sixty- second spot based on the series was aired during the Super Bowl, which was the first time Friskies aired a television commercial. Products Friskies-brand products currently include dry food, canned wet food and treats for cats. According to the Friskies website, there are more than 50 variations of Friskies cat food. There are five dry food flavors sold in bags, including \\"Seafood Sensations\\" and \\"Grillers.\\" Wet foods are sold in various flavors, such as chicken or seafood, and in vacuum bags or cans. The Tasty Treasures canned wet food has cheese and bacon flavors. SauceSations canned wet food is mixed with sauces. There are also pouches of Friskies Party Mix treats, and \\"Pull 'n Play\\" treats that are edible tender strings. In 2003, the Friskies brand was re-launched with new packaging. By this time, Friskies was the largest market-share holder in the cat food segment, with a 60 percent share of the wet food market and 49.3 percent share for dry food.

The Beavers won the season-ending Civil War by a point with a late touchdown. Oregon was led on the field by All-American quarterback Bob Berry, who finished thirteenth in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy, just behind Joe Namath (Alabama) and Gale Sayers (Kansas).

Active in the 1577-1603 period, Ponsonby published the works of Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, and other members of the Sidney circle;Michael Brennan, \\"William Ponsonby: Elizabethan Stationer,\\" Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography Vol. 7 No. 3 (1983), p. 91. he has been called \\"the leading literary publisher of Elizabethan times.\\"Harry Gidney Aldis, The Printed Book, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1951; p. 38. Ponsonby completed his apprenticeship under stationer William Norton on 11 January 1571. Around 1576 he established his own bookshop at the sign of the Bishop's Head in St. Paul's Churchyard.Michael G. Brennan, and Noel J. Kinnamon, A Sidney Chronology 1554-1654, London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003; pp. 28-9. Ponsonby's relationship with the works of Spenser began when he issued the 1590 volume of The Faerie Queene, Books 1-3. Ponsonby published all of Spenser's future works, including the complete edition of The Faerie Queene in 1596; he issued the entire Spenserian canon except for the poet's earliest volume, The Shepherd's Calendar (1579). In regard to Sidney, Ponsonby issued both the 1590 and 1593 editions of the Arcadia, the 1595 edition of The Defence of Poesie and the large 1598 folio collection that included Astrophil and Stella. The works of Sidney's sister Mary, Countess of Pembroke, including Antony (1592, 1595), her translation of Garnier's tragedy, were also published by Ponsonby. Ponsonby nourished a reputation as an elite publisher, and so avoided what the Elizabethans considered lower-prestige product -- like stage plays. Ponsonby printed none of the plays of English Renaissance drama that are such a strong focus of modern interest in his era, and he generally avoided the non-dramatic works of dramatists as well -- though his 1583 edition of Robert Greene's Mamilia, Part II, and his 1594 publication of George Chapman's The Shadow of Night, are exceptions to this general trend. In 1595 Ponsonby tried to register ownership of Lewes Lewkenor's The Estate of English fugitives under the King of Spain and his ministers but the edition was printed, possibly piratically, by John Drawater, assistant to Thomas Blagrave Master of the Revels (Ponsonby's apprentice Edward Blount largely followed his master's example of avoiding plays during his own independent career -- though Blount made a few exceptions, most notably the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays in 1623.) Ponsonby made occasional exceptions for closet drama, as with the Countess of Pembroke's Antony noted above. In an age when the disciplines of publishing and printing were largely (though not entirely) separate, Ponsonby concentrated on publishing and commissioned professional printers to print his texts. The 1590 Faerie Queene volume, for example, was printed by John Wolfe, while Ponsonby's 1595 edition of Spenser's Amoretti and Epithalamion was printed by Peter Short. The 1583 Mamilia was printed by Thomas Creede. On Ponsonby's death in 1604, many of his copyrights passed to his brother-in-law, stationer Simon Waterson.Adolphus William Ward and Alfred Rayney Waller, eds.

He was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Canary Islands), Spain, on 21 October 1926. His father, Otto Kraus, was born in Austria and Francisco was the first born of the Kraus-Trujillo family; soon would follow Alfredo, Enriqueta Lola and Carmen. Vocal technique He and his brother Alfredo began their training with María Suárez Fiol, (born in Madrid, 1897 – died in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1987). The first songs in front of an audience were in the house of his teacher, where Mrs Fiol organized benefit concerts. He started singing in the Choir of the School of the Heart of Maria, and made an audition for Soloists in the Philharmonic Society of Las Palmas. After coming back from Barcelona, Francisco married his fiancé Enedina Kraus. He studied Voice technique in Milan with famous teacher and Soprano Mercedes Llopart. Mrs Llopart’s legacy of exquisite technique and knowledge of voice production was passed on to her students, Alfredo Kraus, Renata Scotto, Anna Moffo, Fiorenza Cossotto, Ivo Vinco, Greek soprano Elena Suliotis, Venezuelan coloratura soprano Cecilia Nuñez Albanese, and Francisco Kraus. Francisco’s baritone voice has a wide vocal range, up to a high B with powerful bright, dark, rich notes, placed high in the mask. His career In December 1960, Francisco made his Debut in the “Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Verdi” in Trieste with the Moussorgsky opera Khovanshchina in the role of Shaklovity and using the stage name Franco di Marco. Later he continued singing Enrico of Lucia di Lammermoor, Valentin of the opera Faust, and Germont of La Traviata. He returned to Spain where he appeared with the “Festivales of Spain” in La Coruña. He made his debut in the “Teatro de la Zarzuela” in Madrid with the Compañía Lírica Nacional with great success. With this same Company he made a tour of Spain with identical results. In 1962 he formed his own company and toured Spain for four years, singing zarzuela: La Bruja, La Tabernera del Puerto, Katiuska, El Huésped del Sevillano, La Calesera, La Rosa del Azafrán, La del Soto del Parral, and other works of the repertoire with artists like Amparo Azcón, Celia Langa, Pilarín Alvarez, Rosa Gil, Fina Gessa, María Pastor, Eduardo Bermúdez, Enrique del Portal, José Luis Cancela and Andrés García Martí, under the baton of the Maestros Jose Terol and Mariano de las Heras. In Madrid, in June 1963, he performed several presentations of the opera Marina, by the Spanish composer Emilio Arrieta. The performances took place in El Parque del Retiro, with his brother Alfredo. In 1966 a contract with the company of Maria Francisca Caballer and Agustín Lisbona, to perform in the National Theater of Caracas, “Teatro Nacionál,” took him to Venezuela for one long season. He then returned to the Canary Islands to dedicate more time to family matters. His break from the Operatic scene was not total, however, and in the 1970s he took part in several seasons of Zarzuela with the Isaac Albéniz Company of Juan Jose Seoane, performing all over Spain and the Spanish Islands. Career in Venezuela At the end of 1978 Kraus returned to Venezuela for a series of concerts and performances in Radio and Television. He performed in Teatro Municipal de Caracas with Opera Metropolitana de Caracas OMAC the opera Marina, with Alfredo Kraus, soprano Cecilia Núñez Albanese and Cayito Aponte, with the Orquesta Filármonica de Caracas conducted by Dominican Maestro Carlos Piantini. He had a series of concerts in Hogar Canario de Caracas and Teatro Nacional. His brother Alfredo was very often performing in Caracas, Teatro Municipal, with OMAC (Caracas Metropolitan Opera Company). This time the stay would last nine years since, aside from his performances Kraus was offered the position as professor of vocal technique in the Superior School of Music of Caracas, Escuela Superior de Musica J.A. Lamas and also in the Escuela de Música Prudencio Esaá. He was very active as a teacher and some of his students were: Fanny Arjona soprano, Amelia Salazar, Natacha Valladares, Marisol Gil, Alfredo Olarte, Rosaura Longa, and Biella Da Costa. In 1987, he returned to Spain to teach voice technique in the Conservatory of the “Gran Teatre del Liceu” in Barcelona, where he taught until his retirement. Retirement His last public performance took place in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 1996, where he was awarded the Gold medal of the City. In July 2000 Kraus and his wife Enedina decided to be based permanently in the city where he was born. In November 2000, Francisco Kraus received the tribute of the Canary Island “Friends of the Zarzuela”, who gave him a Plaque in recognition of his long career.

He is notable for being the all-time leading goalscorer for Notts County. Rotherham United Bradd started his league career at Rotherham who signed him from non-league club East Sterndale. His spell at Millmoor was a brief one, in which he only scored one goal which, ironically, was the winning goal against Notts County, the club with which he is most associated, in a League Cup tie. He joined Notts shortly afterwards. Notts County It was at Notts County where his career took shape. Bradd spent eleven seasons at Meadow Lane, barely missing a game as the club climbed steadily away from the lower reaches of the fourth division into a comfortable second division position. Though the club struggled in his first season, Bradd finished top scorer, with 10 goals. It was the arrival of Don Masson in 1968 that kick started the club's upturn in fortune over the next decade. The 1970/71 season saw the club win promotion, and the Division Four title, by 9 points. The club finished fourth in its first season back in the Third Division, with Bradd finishing as top scorer with 21 goals. The following season Bradd earned his second promotion with the club as it returned to the Second Division after a long absence, also reaching the League Cup quarter finals, a run which saw County beat two top flight clubs, Stoke and Southampton, with Bradd scoring in both games. Although linked to moves to the top flight with Coventry and WBA, Bradd spent a further five seasons at the club, which saw County establish themselves as a comfortable second division side. Bradd finished as top scorer a further two times, in 1975/76 and 1976/77, though the last of these was jointly held with Mick Vinter. During this period the club embarked on another notable League Cup run in 1975/76, again reaching the Quarter Finals and knocking out Sunderland, Leeds and Everton on the way. The defeat of Everton came in a 2-1 Replay victory at Meadow Lane in which Bradd scored twice in arguably his finest County performance. Finally in 1978, at the age of 30, after 11 seasons which saw Bradd score 125 league goals, he was sold to Stockport Stockport County Stockport's purchase of Bradd proved to be an inspired one as Bradd scored 31 league goals in his three-year spell at Edgeley Park, despite often being employed as a central defender. Whilst at Stockport Bradd scored the only hat-trick of his career when he netted three times in the last ten minutes as Stockport came from 4-1 down to claim a 4–4 draw against promotion chasing Barnsley. Another highlight from his time at Edgely Park came when he scored against Arsenal at Highbury in the League Cup. Bradd was freed by Stockport at the end of the 1980/81 season. Late career Bradd joined Wigan following his release from Stockport. Despite being 33 years of age, Bradd helped the club, who had only joined the football league three years earlier, to their first ever promotion, scoring nineteen league goals. He also netted yet another memorable game in the League Cup, scoring a goal as Wigan shocked Chelsea with a 4–2 win. The following season Bradd made another twenty two third division appearances for Wigan, scoring five times. He also briefly went on loan to Bristol Rovers, scoring in his only appearance. He retired at the end of the season at the age of thirty five.

It is a 1,000+ acre (3 km²) working farm owned and operated by the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) as an environmental education center. In 1683, settlers Gulian Verplanck and Francis Rombout bought the 85,000-acre (430 km²) tract, including the farm, from the Wappinger Indians for goods worth approximately $1,250. In 1708 the Great Partition of this land put the area around the farm in the Verplanck family's hands. Instead of working it themselves, they took in tenant farmers to keep the land worked and productive. They built the stone tenant farmhouse near the property's main entrance in four sections between the late 17th and early 19th centuries. An 1836 subdivision of the property gave a thousand acres (4 km²), including the current farm, to descendant James DeLancy Verplanck of nearby Beacon. He had a Greek Revival home, now known as the Manor House, built and moved into it in 1842. A century later, his descendants gave the farm to the state Education Department (SED) for use as a teaching farm. It was used for this purpose by SUNY Farmingdale until the late 1960s, when the college decided it no longer needed the property. In 1973 DEC took it over and converted it to its present use. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Today, DEC uses the property to help visitors learn about basic ecological issues. They can either do this on their own, by walking the property and hiking several trails or perusing the library at the Manor House, or by taking part in the many programs DEC offers or sponsors with other groups on the site.

The original December 13, 1966 listing on the National Register of Historic Places included only the historic downtown core and the village of Siasconset, but was expanded in 1975 to include the entire island, as well as the islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget.Nantucket’s National Historic Landmark Update Gains Advisory Committee Approval At over 30,000 acres, it is the largest conventional historic National Historic Landmark District by area in the contiguous United States. Much of the district was originally designated as a local historic district in 1955, making it one of the earliest historic districts in the United States, along with the Charleston Historic District in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Vieux Carre Historic District in New Orleans. Since 1955, the Nantucket Historic District Commission has been the governing authority charged with overseeing the island's preservation.The Nantucket Historic District Commission : An OverviewHistoric District Commission  History  Nantucket is a uniquely preserved New England seaport, largely developed during the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the whaling industry dominated the town's economy. By 1774, Nantucket accounted for about sixty percent of the New England whaling fleet. In 1840, the town's population peaked at roughly 9,000. However, during the years that followed, several events occurred that resulted in a dramatic downturn in the island's fortunes. By this time, the nearby mainland port of New Bedford, Massachusetts had surpassed Nantucket as the leading whaling port in the nation. Also during this time, the formation of sand bars prevented the increasingly larger ships from entering Nantucket Harbor, forcing the industry to shift to nearby Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard. Another blow came in 1846, when a great fire destroyed much of the town's commercial center and wharves. By the end of the 19th century, when much of the country was experiencing dramatic growth, Nantucket's population had fallen to just 3,000. Thus, the existence of Nantucket's historic buildings is largely due to the island being forgotten for more than half a century, as its architecture survived through neglect. In 1894, the first preservation efforts on Nantucket occurred with a campaign to save the \\"Old Mill\\", a 1746 windmill built by Nathan Wilbur. In 1897, the mill was purchased at auction and donated to the Nantucket Historical Association.The Old Mill During this period, new construction began to reflect the island's historic character.Nantucket Preservation Overview The oldest buildings within the historic district date from the late 17th century. Built mostly of wood, they are utilitarian in style with little ornamentation or detail. In the period that followed the American Revolution, with the rise in whaling wealth, more ornate buildings were constructed by sea captains and merchants in the Federal style. Among these is the Second Congressional Meetinghouse, built in 1809. The most outstanding buildings are situated on Main and Orange Streets, such as the Hadwen-Wright House at 94 Main Street. Immediately following the devastating fire of 1846, the entire commercial district was rebuilt with new two and three-story brick buildings.National Park Service - Maritime History of Massachusetts The rebuilt area is dominated by the predominant Greek Revival style of the 1840s.Nantucket Preservation Trust - Greek Revival Architecture It was not until the 1990s that Nantucket's population surpassed its 1840 peak of 9,000. The island's economy is now mostly based on seasonal tourism, which has put increased pressure on its historic properties. In 2000, the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed Nantucket on its 2000 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places, noting that while \\"Nantucket has a long history of commitment to preservation, an upsurge in the destructive practices of \\"teardowns\\" and \\"gut rehabs,\\" along with the inappropriate sizing and siting of new homes, are dramatically altering the heritage, cultural landscape, and quality of community life on the island.\\"National Park Service - Nantucket Historic District Contributing properties A partial list of contributing properties within the Nantucket Historic District includes: * The Old Mill (1746) * Old Gaol (1806)The Old Gaol 15R Vestal Street * Quaker (Friends) Meeting House (1838)MHC Inventory Form * Nantucket Atheneum (1847)The Island’s Unique Library * St. Paul's Church (1901)Parish History See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Nantucket County, Massachusetts * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts References External links * Town of Nantucket - Nantucket Historic District * Nantucket Historical Association Nantucket, Massachusetts Geography of Nantucket County, Massachusetts National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts National Register of Historic Places in Nantucket County, Massachusetts Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts ","title":"Nantucket Historic District"},{"id":"13287647","text":"Fortune Gallo. Fortune Thomas Gallo (May 9, 1878 - March 28, 1970) (born Fortunato Gallo) was an Italian-born opera impresario. Gallo was owner and General Manager of the traveling San Carlo Opera Company from 1913 until its disbandment in the late 1950s. Biography He was born on May 9, 1878 at Torremaggiore, Italy, a little town in the province of Foggia, to Zelinda Accetturo and Tommaso Gallo. He had two sisters, Antonia and Marianna and two brothers, Giuseppe and Giovanni, who became Italian army officers. His childhood was spent at Torremaggiore, where he became involved with music and musicians, especially the \\"Banda Rossa,\\" which would prove of importance later in his life. In 1895, aboard the vessel \\"Werra,\\" Gallo immigrated to the United States. He worked as a clerk in an Italian bank on Mulberry Street in New York City. From that base it appears Gallo became involved in politics on the local level, amassing contacts and influence within the Italian community. Shortly after the turn of the twentieth century the \\"Banda Rosa\\" was engaged to play in America. Emanating from this situation was the acquaintance of Gallo with Channing Ellery, a patron of music, that led to Gallo's work as an advance man from Ellery's band. By 1910 Gallo had also become manager of another band, operated by Giuseppe Creatore. That same year he rescued an Italian opera company led by Mario Lombardi that was stranded in St. Louis, Missouri by bringing them to New York City and untangling the company's financial difficulties, ultimately assuming its management in December, 1913, and renaming it the San Carlo Opera Company. The company fared well, and in 1927 Gallo built the Gallo Opera House on West 54th Street in New York City which would become Studio 54. Gallo with his wife Sofia Charlebois He not only toured the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America with San Carlo, but in addition, managed Anna Pavlova's ballet company, as well as other troupes. In 1929 Gallo produced the first full-length sound movie of an opera, Leoncavallo's \\"I Pagliacci\\". Furthermore, he managed the Chicago Opera Company in the early 1940s. Fortune Gallo's managerial abilities were lauded because he made opera \\"pay\\". Numerous periodical articles described Gallo's skills, with one portraying his as having produced opera for the \\"masses and not the classes\\". The impresario, often labeled the \\"cut rate opera king,\\" financed and toured with the San Carlo for over forty-five years. He died on March 28, 1970 in New York City. Personal On May 4, 1912 Gallo married Sofia Charlebois, an American lyric soprano in the San Carlo company. She died in 1948.

The village is part of A'ana Alofi III Electoral Constituency (Faipule District) which forms part of the larger political district A'ana. Satapuala is 40 minutes west from the country's capital Apia. The village was relocated in 1942 to build the Faleolo International Airport. Like other land in Samoa, customary land in Satapuala was also alienated during colonialism. Customary land has since come under the government. Part of the former customary village land is where the new Aggie Grey's Lagoon Resort (the Government is the majority shareholder) has been built with a golf course beside the airport. Other Satapuala land includes a large coconut plantation opposite the airport which the government had planned to sell as small freehold lots and to build businesses and resorts. The chiefs (matai) of Satapuala have made legal claims to return customary land from the government for many years. The disputed land is the property of the government's Samoa Trust Estate Corporation (STEC, formerly WSTEC), land which came under the Samoa government when German and New Zealand colonial rule ended in Samoa. Leading Satapuala's legal claim against the government for more than two thousand acres (8 km²) was a high chief of the village, To’alepaiali’i Toeolesulusulu Salesa III, the late Member of Parliament of the A'ana District and a prominent figure in Samoan politics. To'alepaiali'i was a Cabinet Minister in Samoa during the 1980s. He died during a trip to Sydney in November 2008. In the early 20th century this village had also made land claims against the New Zealand colonial administration, since it wanted to put an airport on the village grounds. Like most villages in Samoa, the geographic boundary of Satapuala covers an area from the coastline and inland. The village is separated into two sections. Satapuala-I-Tai (tai means coastal) is the end of the village nearest to the lagoon shoreline. Satapuala-I-Uta (uta means inland) is the end where most of the village people live, and also the place where the village road ends. The village of Satapuala is famous for having the historic Lapita Site. There is one narrow and roughly paved road which connects the two ends of Satapuala-I- Uta, although in Satapuala-I-Tai the road is unpaved. The main Upolu Highway is accessible from the main village junction, or also known as the Magafa. There are a few schools in Satapuala, including district college Satapuala College. Many children from the village attend and so do those from places as far as Leulumoega to Falelatai. There is a large coconut plantation, where coconuts are used to make Samoan Brand Coconut Cream which is sold worldwide. There are some 10 family-owned shops in the village with 3 billiard gaming areas. The traditional 'Sa', evening prayers, takes place each day throughout the village and lasts for about 30 minutes. The 'Sa' is a Prayer Curfew, played throughout most of Samoa. The village is vibrant in colour and culture. Horses used for plantation work are sometimes kept in the village tied amongst the breadfruit and coconut trees. This village is abundant in crops and flowers although the thorny weed vao fefe. Television and radio broadcast reception is reasonable in the village. A few pay phones are found around Satapuala's Main Village Shops, but the majority of pay phones are found at the airport, where there is internet access. Mobile Phones are widely used and through local companies Digicel and Go Mobile. Topping Up, Credit Recharges and SIM Cards can be purchased from the local stores. There are ATM outlets at the ANZ and Westpac branches at the airport. Like most villages in Samoa, Sunday is a sacred day. Churches in the village are Catholic Church of 'Sagato Atonio' and the LDS Church, which is located across the narrow village road from the Catholic Church. Ten minutes west from the village is Mulifanua Wharf where the inter-island ferry terminal is located for passenger and vehicle transport to Savai'i island. Boats to Manono or Apolima Islands are located at Manono Uta and Apolima Uta, further west on the main road past Mulifanua wharf. 2007 South Pacific Games Two of the events from the 2007 edition of the South Pacific Games were held here. Sailing and the Triathlon took place in Satapuala and due to the event, Satapuala became a busy area of the Island of Upolu too, besides Apia and Tuna'imato. Many Samoans and tourists have stood in this village since this is where the main international airport of Samoa, Faleolo International Airport, stands. Only one aircraft disaster was recorded back in the 50s-70s, when a small domestic Polynesian Airlines plane from Pago Pago crashed on the shores of Satapuala. Transport The village is by the main island highway with a regular bus service. Fares to and from Satapuala are only $2 for adults and $1 for children under 12. From Apia to Satapuala the cost of a 40-minute taxi ride is approximately $40 to $50. Sport Volleyball, cricket and rugby union are the most popular sports in the village especially among youths. These take place in the village 'malae', open grounds in front of the 'fale tele' main meeting houses.

Its original manifesto stated that the organization's mission was to \\"liberate\\" abandoned buildings for use by the homeless. In December 1999, Campbell, acting as senior vice president of Rosewater, led vegetarian activist group \\"Food Not Bombs\\" in a protest on public square against the then Cleveland Mayor Michael Reed White's \\"sweeping the streets\\" policy.http://www.clevescene.com/2001-02-01/news/curry-duty/ Mayor White had instituted a policy in unison with other big city mayors, most notably, then Mayor, Rudolph William Louis Giuliani of New York City,http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/07/0413249 of discreet removal of homeless from the streets to public shelters. Homeless advocates claimed this to be part of a larger plan to \\"sweep the streets\\" of the homeless during the holiday shopping season. City officials countered that the policy intended to promote strong economic development, improve city public image and safety, and provide humanitarian assistance to the poor and homeless. As part of this policy, homeless people sleeping in public were approached by police officers, and provided with maps to the new city shelter. If the homeless refused, they were encouraged to move. Failure to cooperate with this policy resulted in several arrests. This brought Mayor White, and the city, into a legal dispute with the American Civil Liberties Union,https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E0D71339F936A15751C1A96F958260&n;=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fA%2fAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union who represented the homeless in a series of lawsuits filed against the city intending to end the \\"sweeping the streets\\" policy, and to prevent further arrests.http://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&s;_site=ohio&p;_multi=AK&p;_theme=realcities&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=0EB6D572ED324A14&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=10&p;_sort=YMD_dateD&s;_trackval=GooglePMhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&s;_site=ohio&p;_multi=AK&p;_theme=realcities&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=0EB6D8A035D88C2B&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=108p_sort=ymd_date:D&s;_trakval=googlePM The explanation given by the ACLU was that the homeless in Cleveland frequently sleep on public sidewalks; they are crisscrossed by underground steam pipes supplying heat to area businesses. The thermal service manholes become heated, hot enough to burn, with steam occasionally escaping from cracks. The concrete sidewalk around the manholes can become quite warm. These areas are known colloquially as \\"steamers,\\" and are popular places for the homeless to sleep when it is cold. As a result, many of the homeless refused shelter, and continued sleeping on the street. Furthermore, according to the homeless, the available shelters were subject to overcrowding, inadequate staffing, and a lack security, resulting in possible threats to property, health, or safety. In a show of support for the homeless, on December 22, 1999, Rosewater's Campbell enlisted the help of \\"Food not Bombs\\" to erect a tent city on public square to protest of the Mayor's policies. Campbell, a Vietnam era veteran and former marine, had frequently advocated against the shelters, preferring a variant of legalized squatting, which he referred to as the \\"requisitioning of abandoned buildings.\\" He actively promoted an independent lifestyle for the nation's homeless, pursuing a program of self- sufficiency, against a policy of public assistance and shelters. Later that night, Mayor White visited the site of the protest on public square. He surveyed the motley erection of tents from his vantage point at Stouffer's Hotel, located across the street, in the Terminal Tower complex. He talked to reporters and appeared on television in an effort to reassure the public, and maintain calm. After Mayor White had left the downtown demonstration, police stormed the square and arrested all present.http://www.workers.org/ww/2000/cleve0113.php The exposure and public sympathy brought about in tandem by the initial arrests coupled with the ACLU response, and the tent protest with its arrests, helped to sway public opinion, and lead to cessation of the unpopular \\"sweeping the streets\\" policy.http://www.clevescene.com/2000-01-06/news/street-fighting-men/full Rosewater, since November 2008, has been registered with the state of Ohio as a not for profit limited liability company.

In 1915, she was fitted with a runway on her forecastle to launch French-made Royal Naval Air Service monoplanes to attack German airships flying over the North Sea, but the aircraft proved unable to achieve the altitude necessary to attack the airships, and the runway had been removed by early 1916. In August 1915, she took part in the hunt in the North Sea for the Imperial German Navy auxiliary cruiser . In February 1916, she replaced the recently lost light cruiser as flagship for Harwich Forces commander, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt.

She was involved in an engagement with German destroyers in the North Sea on 18 July 1916. On 4 August 1916, she struck a mine off Thornton Ridge off the coast of Belgium, but soon returned to action after repairs. In January 1917, Cleopatra participated in an unsuccessful operation to attack German destroyers off the Belgian coast. She underwent modernisation during 1917, and in October 1917 joined the other Harwich Force cruisers in a patrol zone to intercept any German attempt to intercept convoys steaming to and from Scandinavia. She was assigned to the 7th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet in August 1918 as squadron flagship, and served in that capacity through the end of World War I in November 1918 and until March 1919. =Postwar= After leaving the 7th Light Cruiser Squadron in March 1919, Cleopatra rejoined the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron in April 1919 and served in the Baltic Sea from 1919 to 1920 during the British campaign there against Bolshevik and German forces during the Russian Civil War.

It was the only major battle of the Sullivan Expedition, an armed offensive led by General John Sullivan that was ordered by the Continental Congress to end the threat of the Iroquois who had sided with the British in the American Revolutionary War. In the battle, the Iroquois were defeated decisively. A portion of the battlefield is today managed as a state park. The entire battlefield (about ) was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. Description and history The Newtown Battlefield is located along the eastern bank of the Chemung River, in western New York southeast of Elmira. Its main focus is Sullivan Hill, a wooded hill that was fortified by the Iroquois in a bid to ambush Sullivan's column. The main trail followed by Sullivan's troops had to pass near the steep hillside, which was only from the river. Sullivan's advance forces discovered the Iroquois works, and Sullivan set up his artillery on a rise to the south, from which it could command not just Sullivan Hill but also another hill to the east. After cannonading the Iroquois position, Sullivan sent troops up Baldwin Creek, which skirts the hill to the east. These forces eventually formed a battle line that drove the Iroquois from the position. View from the hill below the Newtown Battlefield Monument The state acquired of land, covering most of Sullivan Hill, which it managed first as a state reservation, and then as a state park. A narrow column of white granite known as the Newton Battlefield Monument was erected on top of Sullivan Hill in 1912. On January 19, 2010, New York State Governor David Paterson proposed closing the park to reduce the state's growing budget deficit. However, the park was allowed to remain open after budget adjustments were made throughout the state's park system.

The Hindu Similarly, a tsunami alert was issued in Peninsular Malaysia at 20:50 (local time) for the coastal areas of Perlis, Kedah, Perak and Penang; the alert was lifted two hours later. However, Malaysian authorities had detected a 1-3m high tsunami heading away from the epicenter of the earthquake.  Tectonic summary  right According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake was caused by thrust faulting on the boundary between the Australian Plate and the Sunda Plate. At the location of the earthquake, offshore of the west coast of Sumatra, the Australia plate moves northeast with respect to the Sunda Plate at a velocity of about 69 mm/year, oblique to the orientation of the plate boundary. The component of plate motion perpendicular to the boundary produces thrust faulting on the offshore plate-boundary. The magnitude 7.9 earthquake was also a result of thrust faulting on the same plate boundary. It occurred about 225 km northwest of the magnitude 8.4 earthquake, at the northern end of the aftershock zone. The magnitude 8.4 earthquake was the most powerful earthquake of 2007 to date, more powerful than the two March 2007 Sumatra earthquakes nearby and the 2007 Peru earthquake. It was the second most powerful earthquake since the magnitude 9.3 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, exceeded only by the magnitude 8.6 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake. The two largest earthquakes were the fourth and fifth earthquakes with magnitude 7.9 or greater to have occurred on or near the plate boundaries offshore of western Sumatra in 7 years, the others being the magnitude 7.9 earthquake of 4 June 2000; the magnitude 9.3 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on 26 December 2004; and the magnitude 8.6 Nias–Simeulue earthquake on 28 March 2005. According to data from the Japanese PALSAR microwave sensor aboard the Daichi(ALOS) satellite, South Pagai Island was uplifted, creating 6 new islands, and exposing previously submerged coral reefs as well as enlarging existing islands.

She was one of six ships of the Caroline sub-class and was completed in 1915. Assigned to the Grand Fleet, the Harwich Force, and the Dover Patrol during the war, the ship served as a flagship for part of the war. Her only known combat was a short battle against German torpedo boats in the English Channel, although she was very active patrolling the North Sea and unsuccessfully searching for German ships. Carysfort was assigned to the Home and Atlantic Fleets after the war and was sent to the Mediterranean Fleet during the Chanak Crisis of 1922–23 to support British interests in Turkey. In 1922, she patrolled off the Irish coast during the Irish Civil War. The ship was placed in reserve after returning home in 1923 and, aside from ferrying troops overseas, remained in reserve until she was sold for scrap in 1931. Design and description The C-class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range.Friedman, pp. 38, 42 Ordered in July–August 1913 as part of the 1913–14 Naval Programme,Friedman, p. 42 the Carolines were enlarged and improved versions of the preceding s. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Carysfort was powered by four direct-drive Brown-Curtis steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of .Raven & Roberts, p. 403 The turbines used steam generated by eight Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of . She carried tons of fuel oil. The ship had a crew of 301 officers and other ranks. Carysforts main armament consisted of two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. Her secondary armament consisted of eight QF Mk IV guns, four on each side, one pair forward of the bridge, another pair abaft it on the forecastle deck and the other two pairs one deck lower amidships. For anti-aircraft defence, she was fitted with one QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss gun.Raven & Roberts, p. 402 The ship also mounted two twin, above- water, mounts for torpedoes, one on each broadside. The Carolines were protected by a waterline belt amidships that ranged in thickness from and a deck. The walls of their conning tower were 6 inches thick. =Wartime modifications= A few weeks after completion, her 6-pounder anti-aircraft (AA) gun was replaced by an Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers Mk II anti-aircraft (AA) gun. Between August–October 1916, her forward pair of 4-inch guns were replaced by another 6-inch gun and a QF 4-inch Mk V gun replaced her 3-pounder AA gun. In 1917, her aftmost 4-inch guns were replaced by another pair of 21-inch torpedo mounts. During 1917–18, her pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director. In November 1918 her AA gun and a pair of 4-inch guns was replaced by a pair of QF 20-cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. AA guns abaft the bridge, where the 4-inch guns had originally been located. An additional 6-inch gun was added abaft the funnels in March–April 1919 in lieu of her last 4-inch guns. Sometime between 1919 and 1924 the ship received a pair of 2-pounder Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" guns on single mounts. All of these changes adversely affected the ship's stability and the additional 21-inch torpedo tubes and the aft control position were removed by the end of 1921.Raven & Roberts, pp. 46, 48–50 Construction and career Carysfort, the fourth ship of her name in the Royal Navy, was laid down by Pembroke Dockyard in Pembroke Dock, Wales,Colledge, p. 62 or Hawthorn Leslie and Company at Tyneside, EnglandGardiner & Gray, p. 56Friedman, p. 412 on 25 February 1914, launched on 14 November 1914, and completed in June 1915. Commissioned into service in that same month, Carysfort was assigned to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron (4th LCS) of the Grand Fleet in August 1915.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 56–57 Early that month, the squadron was dispatched to patrol off the Norwegian coast in search of the German commerce raider which was trying to return to Germany. While the squadron did not find her, the German ship was forced to scuttle herself on 9 August by other British cruisers to avoid being captured.Corbett, pp. 122–26 In April 1916, she relieved her damaged sister in the 5th Light Cruiser Squadron in the Harwich Force, which operated in the North Sea to guard the eastern approaches to the Strait of Dover and English Channel, and so did not participate in the Battle of Jutland a month later.Gardiner & Gray, p. 57 In May, the ship participated in towing trials with the Coastal-class airship C 1.Layman, p. 167 On the evening of 22 July, she was flagship of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, as he took Carysfort, her half-sister , and eight destroyers to sea to patrol the sea lanes between Felixstowe and the Dutch coast. He split his forces to cover the two routes involved and encountered three German torpedo boats en route to attack merchant shipping in that area around 01:15 of the following morning. Hampered by an inopportune rain squall and a German smoke screen, Tyrwhitt's ships were only able to engage the Germans for a short time before they disengaged. Tyrwhitt then ordered Canterbury and her escort to intercept the fleeing Germans; they spotted six torpedo boats about a half-hour later and opened fire at 02:02. Visibility was poor because of another smoke screen laid by the Germans and the British ships were forced to disengage without inflicting any damage at 02:25 as they were approaching a minefield.Newbolt, IV, pp. 27–29 On 19 August, the Harwich Force sortied in an attempt to intercept a German raid on Sunderland. The British had decoded German radio messages and knew the High Seas Fleet had sailed, but not its target or purpose and failed to locate the Germans. In contrast, German reconnaissance Zeppelins spotted the Harwich Force several times, but reported it as a force of battleships and cruisers, when, in actuality, it consisted of cruisers and destroyers. These reports, however, did persuade Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, to abandon his attack and turn for home. Losses to submarines and mines during the operation persuaded the British that it was too risky to deploy major forces in the southern part of the North Sea. This left the defence of the southern part of the English coast solely to local defence forces like the Harwich Force. This policy was tested when Scheer attempted another raid on 18–19 October; Tyrwhitt's force was ordered to sea based on German radio signals, but did not locate the Germans. Scheer turned around after one of his cruisers was torpedoed by a British submarine and the High Seas Fleet never again made a sortie into the North Sea in force.Newbolt, IV, pp. 32–51 A few days later, the Harwich Force sortied on the night of 23–24 October in response to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack on the night of 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.Newbolt, IV, pp. 52–55, 58, 373 By October, she had rejoined the 5th LCS and participated in the unsuccessful search for a pair of German light cruisers that destroyed a British convoy returning from Norway on 17 October.Newbolt V, pp. 149–55 In December, Carysfort collided with the merchant ship in the North Sea off Orford Ness, Suffolk, England. By May 1918, she was the flagship of the 7th Light Cruiser Squadron and remained with the squadron through the end of World War I in November 1918 and through at least 1 February 1919. =Post-war activities= By 18 July 1919, Carysfort had been reassigned to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. She remained with the squadron as the Home Fleet was merged into the Atlantic Fleet at least through 18 December 1920. In 1922, she patrolled off the coast of Ireland during the Irish Civil War. She was detached to Turkish waters in September to support of British interests during the Chanak Crisis and remained there until April 1923.Halpern, pp. 400, 423, 439 She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Devonport in September. In September 1924, Carysfort recommissioned for service transporting troops. She became the flagship of the Devonport Reserve in 1927. She carried troops to China from February to July 1929, and then again became flagship of the Devonport Reserve in January 1930, serving in that capacity until relieved by her sister in April 1931, when Carysfort was decommissioned and placed under dockyard control at Devonport. The ship was sold for scrap four months later.

In Yugoslav service she was renamed Nada. Her main armament was a single Mk IX naval gun, although a significant number of secondary and anti-aircraft guns were added towards the end of the war. During the war she escorted a total of 80 convoys whilst in British service, sinking one German U-boat, and escorted another 18 convoys whilst in Yugoslav service. After the war she served in the fledgling Yugoslav Navy as Nada then Partizanka, before being returned to the Royal Navy in 1949. Later that year she was transferred to the Egyptian Navy in which she served as El Sudan until she was decommissioned in 1975. Design, description and construction The s had their origins in a sketch design by the Smiths Dock Company which was based on their whaling ship Southern Pride, but lengthened by . Many ships of the class were modified while they were under construction, or as the opportunity presented itself during service. Mallow had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of extending to at deep load. While her standard displacement was , she displaced at deep load. She had a crew of 85 officers and enlisted men. She was powered using steam created by two cylindrical boilers, driving a single 4-cylinder triple- expansion steam engine that generated . The engine drove a single propeller and Mallow could reach a top speed of . She carried of fuel oil, which gave her a range of at . The ship was armed with a single Mk IX naval gun, two depth charge throwers and two depth charge rails, and could carry 40 depth charges. Ships of the class were also initially equipped with one 2-pounder () \\"pom-pom\\" autocannon and two twin machine guns. Later in the war, they received two additional depth charge throwers and their capacity was increased to 70 depth charges. The machine guns proved inadequate as anti-aircraft (AA) weapons, and were replaced by heavier guns. In 1944, Mallows AA armament included a total of six single Oerlikon cannons, and one 2-pounder\\"pom-pom\\". This was intended to better meet the higher air threat in the Mediterranean Sea. She was also equipped with rocket rails fitted to the gun shield of the 4-inch gun, a forward-firing anti-submarine Hedgehog fitted aft of the main gun, and had a Type 271 radar fitted on the rear of her bridge. By 1945, Mallows armament had been further enhanced with two 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns. Mallow was built by the firm of Harland and Wolff at Belfast, Northern Ireland under as yard number 1065, and was ordered on 19 September 1939, laid down on 14 November, launched on 22 May 1940, and commissioned on 2 July. She was allocated the pennant number K81, and her first captain was Lieutenant Commander William Brown Piggott. Career alt=a black and white photograph of the main gun of ship with a group of men around it Mallow was quickly put into service as a convoy escort from July 1940 onwards; her first convoy was OB 187 which departed Liverpool on 21 July. During the balance of 1940, she was engaged as an escort for 24 convoys as they left from or arrived at Liverpool. During 1941, she escorted 22 convoys to and from Liverpool, as well as three that departed from Milford Haven in Wales. On 1 July 1941, Lieutenant William Robert Boyce Noall took command of Mallow. In October 1941 she was serving with the 37th Escort Group based in Liverpool, along with two sloops and seven other corvettes. In mid-October, the group was assigned to escort Convoy HG 75 from Gibraltar to Liverpool; Mallow and the Shoreham-class sloop participated in sweeps west of Gibraltar against the concentration of German U-boats awaiting the departure of the convoy, and together sank U-204 on the 19th. The convoy departed a week later than scheduled due to the submarine threat. On 26 October, Mallow assisted in driving away U-563 and U-564 from the same convoy. Noall was later made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order for \\"skill and enterprise in dealing with submarines\\" whilst commanding Mallow. During 1942, Mallow escorted 15 convoys, again mainly to and from Liverpool, and escorted the same number in 1943, remaining with the 37th Escort Group covering the UK–Mediterranean and UK–Sierra Leone convoy routes. On 10 May 1943, Temporary Acting Lieutenant Commander Harold Thomas Stewart Clouston assumed command of Mallow. In December 1943, Mallow was not listed as active on the Navy List. In early 1944, Mallow was transferred to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and renamed Nada. She sailed with a reduced crew in convoy OS 68/KMS 42 which departed Liverpool on 12 February and arrived at Gibraltar on 25 February. Nada then commenced escort duties in May, conducting a total of 17 convoy escorts between Gibraltar and Port Said, Egypt, to October. During her final escort of 1944, she was detached from convoy KMS 66 as her crew was not considered \\"politically reliable\\" because they were not aligned with Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces. She is recorded as participating in one escort in early February 1945. After the conclusion of the war, Nada was taken over by the fledgling Yugoslav Navy and renamed Partizanka. In 1949, she was returned to the Royal Navy and reverted to HMS Mallow. The requirement to return Partizanka was a painful blow to the Yugoslavs, as she was one of few modern warships in service with them at the time. On 28 October 1949, Mallow was transferred to the Egyptian Navy where she served as El Sudan. By 1971 she was one of the last ships of her class in use. She remained in service until 1975, latterly in a training role, and was decommissioned in that year.

She was damaged by a mine in July 1918 and was decommissioned on 13 July 1918 for repairs which lasted through the end of World War I and until April 1919.Gardiner, Robert, ed., Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1985, , , , p. 57, 59, 60, (preview of 2006 reprint). =Postwar= After her repairs were complete, Conquest went into the Nore Reserve, and underwent a refit in 1921 while in reserve. She was recommissioned in February 1922 to serve as flagship of the 1st Submarine Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet, continuing in this capacity until January 1927, when she transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She left the Mediterranean in April 1928 and returned to the United Kingdom to enter the commissioned reserve at Portsmouth, in which she remained until 1930. Disposal Conquest was sold on 29 August 1930 to Metal Industries of Rosyth, Scotland, for scrapping. While in the North Sea bound for the shipbreakers yard under tow off Flamborough Head in bad weather on 26 September 1930 with a skeleton crew of six men on board, her tow line broke, and she was adrift and missing until 28 September 1930, when she was found and her tow to Rosyth resumed.

She was one of six ships of the Caroline sub-class and was completed at the beginning of 1915. The ship was assigned to the 1st and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons (LCS) of the Grand Fleet for the entire war and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. Cordelia spent most of her time on uneventful patrols of the North Sea. She spent most of 1919 as a training ship before she was recommissioned for service with the Atlantic Fleet in 1920. The ship was placed in reserve at the end of 1922 and was sold for scrap in mid-1923. Design and description The C-class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range.Friedman, pp. 38, 42 Ordered in July–August 1913 as part of the 1913–14 Naval Programme,Friedman, p. 42 the Carolines were enlarged and improved versions of the preceding s. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a mean draught of . Displacement was at normal and at deep load. Cordelia was powered by four direct-drive Brown-Curtis steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of .Raven & Roberts, p. 403 The turbines used steam generated by eight Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of . She carried tons of fuel oil. The ship had a crew of 301 officers and other ranks. Cordelias main armament consisted of two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. Her secondary armament consisted of eight QF Mk IV guns, four on each side, one pair forward of the bridge, another pair abaft it on the forecastle deck and the other two pairs one deck lower amidships. For anti-aircraft defence, she was fitted with one QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss gun.Raven & Roberts, p. 402 The ship also mounted two twin, above- water, mounts for torpedoes, one on each broadside. The Carolines were protected by a waterline belt amidships that ranged in thickness from and a deck. The walls of their conning tower were 6 inches thick. =Wartime modifications= In August 1915, her 6-pounder anti-aircraft (AA) gun was replaced by an Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers Mk II anti-aircraft (AA) gun. In September–October 1917 the ship's armament was extensively revised. Her forward pair of 4-inch guns were replaced by another 6-inch gun, her aftmost 4-inch guns were replaced by another pair of 21-inch torpedo mounts and a QF 4-inch Mk V gun replaced her 3-pounder AA gun. In addition, her pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director, her conning tower was replaced by a lighter one with thinner armour and a flying- off platform installed over the forecastle. This was removed between April and August 1918 when an additional 6-inch gun was added abaft the funnels in lieu of her forward main-deck 4-inch guns. Cordelias last 4-inch guns, including the Mk V AA gun, were replaced by a pair of QF 20-cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. AA guns abaft the bridge, where the 4-inch guns had originally been located. Sometime between 1919 and 1923, the ship received a pair of 2-pounder Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" guns on single mounts. All of these changes adversely affected the ship's stability and the additional 21-inch torpedo tubes and the aft control position were removed by the end of 1921.Raven & Roberts, pp. 46, 48–50 Construction and career Cordelia, the third ship of her name in the Royal Navy, was laid down by Pembroke Dockyard in Pembroke Dock, Wales,Colledge, p. 78 on 21 July 1913. She was launched on 23 February 1914, and completed in January 1915.Gardiner & Gray, p. 56 Commissioned into service in the Royal Navy that same month, Cordelia was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) of the Grand Fleet.Gardiner & Gray, p. 57 In early August 1914, Cordelia and the rest of her squadron were among the ships dispatched to hunt for the German commerce raider , which was trying to return to Germany. Although the squadron did not find her, the German ship was forced to scuttle herself by other British cruisers on 9 August to avoid being captured.Corbett, pp. 122–26 During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May-1 June 1916, the 1st LCS was assigned to screen Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers and were the first British ships to spot and engage the ships of the German High Seas Fleet on the afternoon of 31 May. Cordelia fired four rounds from her main armament at the light cruiser , but they fell short of the target. The ship was not heavily engaged during the battle and only fired a total of a dozen rounds from her 6-inch (152-mm) guns and three from her 4-inch (102-mm) guns. So far as is known, she did not hit anything, nor was she damaged herself.Campbell, pp. 31–32, 360 By October 1917, she had been transferred to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. Cordelia remained with the 4th LCS through at least 1 February 1919. Later that month, she was reduced to reserve at Devonport. By 1 May 1919, however, she had been assigned to the Devonport Gunnery School, and by 18 January 1920 she had recommissioned for service in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron in the Atlantic Fleet. and remained there through 18 December 1920. In 1921, Cordelia joined the light cruisers , , and and the destroyers , , , , , , , and in a Baltic cruise, departing the United Kingdom on 31 August. The ships crossed the North Sea and transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to enter the Baltic Sea, where they called at Danzig in the Free City of Danzig; Memel in the Klaipėda Region; Liepāja and Riga Latvia; Tallinn, Estonia; Helsinki, Finland; Stockholm, Sweden; Copenhagen, Denmark; Gothenburg, Sweden; and Kristiania, Norway, before crossing the North Sea and ending the voyage at Port Edgar, Scotland, on 15 October 1921. Cordelia patrolled off the coast of Ireland in 1922 during the Irish Civil War. In December 1922, she was decommissioned and placed in the Nore Reserve. She was sold for scrap in July 1923.

The geographical jurisdiction of the North Gujarat University encompasses four districts: Mehsana, Patan, Banaskantha and Sabarkantha. It is NACC 'A' accredited state university with a CGPA of 3.02. History To cater to the cultural and education needs of the area, North Gujarat University was established by Ordinance No. 5 of 1986 dated 17 May 1986 which was later passed as the North Gujarat University Act No. 22 of 1986 on 11 September 1986 by Gujarat Legislative Assembly. The university has been functioning, growing, and expanding steadily since then. Location and campus growth This university was carved out of Gujarat University. On bifurcation, the North Gujarat University inherited no physical assets from its parent university. Patan, a historical town in northern part of Gujarat, was officially designated as the headquarters of the university. The town happens to have composite campus of four affiliated colleges. The managing council of the colleges was kind enough to let the infant university rent its two hostel buildings to accommodate its offices. Thus the university began to operate and serve 41 colleges scattered over the three districts of Banaskantha, Mehsana and Sabarkantha.Online Admission Process With the two hostel buildings, the university rented Gandhi Memorial Hall to house its library. The aim was to start building a nucleus library for the future post-graduate departments. The university simultaneously moved the state government to acquire land measuring about from farmers. It also requested the state government to transfer its seed farm land measuring about to the university. This entailed considerable delay owing to litigation in the State High Court and then in the Supreme Court. Following the Supreme Court judgment, acquisition of the land has been possible. As a result, over the years the university has been able to get land as follows: * Government land * Land acquired from farmers . The university will, in due course, acquire land measuring from one farmer. The total land available is . In addition to this, the university has received a property worth Rs.10 lakhs donated by the Gramodhyog Mandal, Patan. The university employment bureau is housed in that building. Proposals to the state government for further assistance in materializing plans for more constructions, in phased manner, are under active consideration. =Vice- Chancellor= * Shri K.P.

Although they are widespread they occur only locally.Fauna EuropaeaTree of Life Habitat These rare butterflies can be found in warm, sunny and open places such as grassy herb rich meadows, vineyards, river banks, wetlands, cultivated areas, brushy places, wasteland, rocky cliffs and karst terrains, at an elevation of from 0 to 1,700 meters above sea level, but usually under 900 meters. Description Dorsal view The southern festoon can reach a wingspan of 46–52 mm. The females have slightly longer wings, usually lighter colored than males. The basic color of the wings is yellow, with a complicated pattern of several black bands and spots. On the edges of the hindwings they have a black sinuous line with a series of blue and red warning spots to deter potential predators (aposematism). The body is dark brown and bears red patches on the sides of the abdomen. This species is rather similar to Zerynthia rumina, Zerynthia cerisyi and Zerynthia cretica. However this butterfly can be confused only with the Spanish festoon (Z. rumina). The differences are in the presence of blue on the hind wings of Z. polyxena and the relatively lower amount of red on its forewings as compared to Z. rumina. The ranges of these two species overlap only in southeast France. The caterpillars of Z. polyxena are up to 35 millimeters long. They are initially black, then they are yellowish with six rows of fleshy orange and black spikes all over the body.

Adults fly from April to June in a single brood. The adults are active for no more than three weeks. The females lay their eggs singly or in small groups at the bottom of the host plants. The eggs are spherical and whitish at first, bluish colored before hatching. The caterpillars feed on birthworts (mainly (Aristolochia clematitis, Aristolochia rotunda, Aristolochia pistolochia, Aristolochia pallida).Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa The special food of the larvae provides the toxic substances which then also go to the adults, making them inedible. The young caterpillars feed at first on flowers and young shoots, while after the second molt they feed on leaves. The pupae stay linked to a support by a silk belt for wintering and the new adults hatch the next spring. References Bibliography *Capinera, J. L.

The earliest known trisonic wind tunnel was dated to 1950 and was located in El Segundo, California before it closed in 2007. Other trisonic wind tunnels currently in operation are those located at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis.  El Segundo Trisonic Wind Tunnel  The El Segundo Trisonic Wind Tunnel or North American Trisonic Wind Tunnel (NATWT) was a wind tunnel that was located in El Segundo, California. It was built by North American Aviation in the 1950s. The tunnel had a maximum testing speed of Mach 3.5. The NATWT was a blow-down type tunnel. In contrast to a continuous wind tunnel, a blow-down wind tunnel only provides air for short period. A continuous wind tunnel is driven by large fans and typically is only capable of subsonic speeds. Because a blow-down tunnel can build up pressure over a long period time, it can release air at faster speeds. The NATWT used two Westinghouse motors, totaling 10,000 hp and consuming 8 megawatts of electricity, that drove two compressors. NATWT had its own substation to supply its high electrical demand. During the hot summer season, NATWT ran on a night schedule to balance its load with public air conditioning. The compressors pressurized eight large spheres totaling . These spheres were connected to a single manifold that connected to a valve mechanism. When the valve was opened, the compressed air passed through the settling chamber, nozzle, and the test section, where instrumented aerodynamic models were mounted. A diffusing area that expanded in size slowed the air before it was exhausted vertically into the atmosphere. The diffuser area included a colander-like sieve made of steel to catch debris in the event of a catastrophic model failure. The speed of the air was determined by the pressure of the spheres and the cross sectional area of the wind tunnel nozzle and diffuser. A smaller cross section in the nozzle caused the air to move faster. The NATWT could change the shape of the nozzle by operating a series of hydraulic pistons that would bend one-inch thick steel plates into the desired contour. A distinguishing feature of the NATWT was the size of its test section []. Unlike most blow-down wind tunnels, the NATWT test section had a so-called \\"walk in\\" test section that could accommodate very large aerodynamic models. Large models have several advantages: * ability to model relatively small features, such as vortex generators * ability to instrument the model with more pressure probes and sensors * more surface area enabling more pressure sensors * more interior space for instrumentation Because of the \\"walk in\\" nature of NATWT, the tunnel was designed with the possibility that someone could accidentally be locked in the tunnel. Two large emergency safety switches were provided. One was located at the test section, the other at the diffuser area. When either of these safety switches were activated, the valve could not be opened. Another feature of NATWT was the ability to visualize airflow over a model surface. By using optics built into the test section, an engineer could view air disturbance patterns as they were occurring during a test. =History= When Rockwell International purchased North American Aviation, it also gained ownership of the NATWT. The NATWT was then gifted to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1998, with the intention of NATWT becoming a university research facility. It became known as the Micro Craft Trisonic Wind Tunnel. In 2007, UCLA decided to close the trisonic wind tunnel, citing environmental issues. The last test to be conducted at TWT was completed on August 28, 2007. It was designated as test TWT 807. TWT was demolished in 2009.

The well-known vernier scale and micrometer screw-gauge are classic examples that make use of such graduations. History Dividing engine at the Museo Galileo in Florence. There has always been a need for accurate measuring instruments. Whether it is a linear device such as a ruler or vernier or a circular device such as a protractor, astrolabe, sextant, theodolite, or setting circles for astronomical telescopes, the desire for ever greater precision has always existed. For every improvement in the measuring instruments, such as better alidades or the introduction of telescopic sights, the need for more exact graduations immediately followed. In early instruments, graduations were typically etched or scribed lines in wood, ivory or brass. Instrument makers devised various devices to perform such tasks. Early Islamic instrument makers must have had techniques for the fine division of their instruments, as this accuracy is reflected in the accuracy of the readings they made. This skill and knowledge seems to have been lost, given that small quadrants and astrolabes in the 15th and 16th centuries did not show fine graduations and were relatively roughly made.Daumas Maurice, Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers, Portman Books, London 1989 In the 16th century, European instrument makers were hampered by the materials available. Brass was in hammered sheets with rough surfaces and iron graving tools were poor quality. There were not enough makers to have created a long tradition of practice and few were trained by masters. Transversals set a standard in the early 14th century. Tycho Brahe used transversals on his instruments and made the method better known. Transversals based on straight lines do not provide correct subdivisions on an arc, so other methods, such as those based on the use of circular arcs as developed by Philippe de La Hire, were also used. Another system was created in the 16th century by Pedro Nunes and was called nonius after him. It consisted of tracing a certain number of concentric circles on an instrument and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. Thus the outermost quadrant would have 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the alidade fell was noted. A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure. However, this system was difficult to construct and used by few. Tycho Brahe was one exception. Some improvements to Nunes' system were developed by Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius. Curtius' work led directly to that of Pierre Vernier, published in 1631. Vernier refined this process and gave us the vernier scale. However, though these various techniques improved the reading of graduations, they did not contribute directly to the accuracy of their construction. Further improvements came slowly, and a new development was required: the dividing engine. Prior work on the development of gear cutting machines had prepared the way. Such devices were required to cut a circular plate with uniform gear teeth. Clockmakers were familiar with these methods and they were important in developing dividing engines. George Graham devised a process of using geometric methods to divide the limb of an instrument. He developed a sophisticated beam compass to aid marking of the graduations. John Bird and Jeremiah Sisson followed on with these techniques. These beam compass techniques were used into the 19th century, as the dividing engines that followed did not scale up to the largest instruments being constructed. Circular Dividing Engine The first true circular dividing engine was probably constructed by Henry Hindley, a clockmaker, around 1739. This was reported to the Royal Society by John Smeaton in 1785.Smeaton, John, Observations on the Graduation of Astronomical Instruments, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Volume 76, 1785 It was based directly on a gear cutting machine for clockworks. It used a toothed index plate and a worm gear to advance the mechanism. Duc de Chaulnes created two dividing engines between 1765 and 1768 for dividing circular arcs and linear scales. He desired to improve on the graduation of instruments by removing the skill of the maker from the technique where possible. While beam compass use was critically dependent on the skill of the user, his machine produced more regular divisions by virtue of its design. His machines were also inspired by the prior work of the clockmakers. Jesse Ramsden followed duc de Chaulnes by five years in the production of his dividing engine. As with the prior inventions, Ramsden's used a tangent screw mechanism to advance the machine from one position to another. However, he had developed a screw-cutting lathe that was particularly advanced and produced a superior product.Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers; A history of man's search to know his world and himself, Random House, 1983, This engine was developed with funding from the Board of Longitude on condition that it be described in detail (along with the related screw-cutting lathe) and not be protected by patent. This allowed others to freely copy the device and improve on it. In fact, the Board required that he teach others to construct their own copies and make his dividing engine available to graduate instruments made by others. Refinements to the Dividing Engine Edward Troughton was the first to build a copy of the Ramsden design. He enhanced the design and produced his own version. This permitted an improvement in the accuracy of the dividing engine. Samuel Rhee developed his own endless screw cutting machine and was able to sell machines to others. His screws were considered the finest available at the time. In France, Étienne Lenoir created a dividing engine of greater accuracy than the English version. Mégnié, Richer, Fortin and Jecker had also built dividing engines of considerable quality. By the beginning of the 19th century, it was possible to make instruments such as the sextant that remained fully serviceable and of sufficient accuracy to be in use for a half century or more. The dividing engine was unique among developments in the manufacture of scientific instruments, as it was immediately accepted by all makers. There was no uncertainty in the value of this development.Ronald Pearsall, Collecting and Restoring Scientific Instruments, David and Charles, London 1974, See also Henry Joseph Grayson - an Australian inventor who developed an engine (~1900) for making diffraction gratings that ruled 120,000 lines to the inch (approximately 4,700 per mm).

KIS offers protection from malware, as well as email spam, phishing and hacking attempts, and data leaks. Kaspersky Lab Diagnostics results are distributed to relevant developers through the MIT License. Windows edition =Version 2007 (6.0)= Version 6.0 was the first release of KIS. PC World magazine praised version 6.0's detection of malware. KIS detected 100 percent of threats on a subset of the January 2006 wild-list, a list of prevalent threats. The suite detected almost 100 (99.57%) percent of adware samples. KIS has the ability to scan within compressed or packed files, detecting 83.3 percent of the \\"hidden\\" malware. However, version 6.0 was criticized for not completely removing malware by leaving Registry entries and files. PC World also highlighted the suite's false positives — eight of 20,000 clean files were incorrectly flagged as malicious — and its noticeable impact on computer performance. However, data is cached from each scan, making each subsequent scan faster. The firewall blocked all attacks from inside and outside the computer when tested. The magazine found the graphical user interface to be awkward to navigate. Features such as parental controls and instant messaging protection, found in competing suites from Symantec and McAfee, were not a part of version 6.0. Both CNET and PC World criticized the suite's relatively high retail price, US$79.95. KIS 6.0 supports Windows 98 SE, ME, NT Workstation 4.0, 2000 Professional, XP Home Edition, XP Professional, XP Professional x64, and Vista. 50 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0 are required. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system. =Version 2008 (7.0)= Version 7.0 introduced a redesigned GUI. Components were renamed and reorganized; the Anti-hacker module was renamed to the Firewall, and the Anti- Spy module was integrated with the Privacy Control module. PC World described the new interface as \\"intuitive\\" and \\"great-looking\\". Parental controls were introduced, with specific settings for different age categories, such as \\"child\\" or \\"parent\\". Within age categories are content categories, such as drugs or violence. Users can manually configure profiles. Filtering profiles can be associated with users. Since content is filtered at the network level, the feature will work with any Internet browser. The filter relies on a database of known URLs and can analyse websites in real-time. Attempts to access forbidden URLs are logged, and sites visited are tracked as well, raising privacy issues. Limits on Internet access may be set based on time, and chat rooms along with webmail sites can be manually blocked. Spam filtering integrates with Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and The Bat!. E-mail content is analysed and scored, and e-mail with scores above two specified thresholds are either marked as \\"!!spam\\" or \\"??probably spam\\". The Mail Dispatcher feature shows subject and sender information for messages, and allows users to avoid downloading blatant spam by selecting which messages to download. The filter self-trains by analyzing incoming and outgoing e-mail not marked as spam, or by analyzing folders only containing spam or valid e-mail. Senders of verified valid e-mail are whitelisted. E-mail can also be whitelisted or blacklisted based on phrases present in the text. E-mail with non-ASCII characters or invisible text can also be blocked. However, version 7.0 had a relatively poor showing, misidentifying 30 percent of valid messages in PC Magazine testing. 30 percent of spam also made to the inbox. Protection against data leaks was incorporated in this release. The suite warns users when programs attempt to access or send data from certain areas, such as where Internet Explorer stores webform information. Malware protection was mostly positive in detection and disinfection tests by AV- Test.org. Version 7.0 detected 100 percent of wildlist threats. Using one- month-old signatures and a set of new malware, however, detection fell to 14 percent. Files were scanned at 5.24 megabytes per second. Version 7.0 successfully identified all six actively running rootkits, four of six inactive rootkits, and was only able to remove two of six rootkits. The firewall correctly blocked all attempted outside connections, with a reasonable level of security when left on default settings. This version drops support for the Windows 98, 2000, and NT. Windows XP Service Pack 2 is required, except in the case of XP Professional x64 edition. Vista is supported as well. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system. 75 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0. =Version 2009 (8.0)= This version introduces a revised user interface, an application filtering module, an updated anti-virus engine, and a vulnerability scanner. The main window separates settings in four categories, compared to eight in its predecessor. A status bar changes colour (green, yellow, and red) to reflect overall program status and flashes to divert attention when needed. PC Magazine also noted pop-up notifications were kept to a minimum. Kaspersky claims the core anti-virus engine was revised to increase scan speed. PC Magazine found an initial scan took over two hours, however subsequent scans took two minutes to complete. However, malware detection was relatively low in comparison to other anti-virus applications tested. Out of 650 thousand samples, version 8.0 detected 95.6 percent. The top score was around 99 percent. Using two-week-old signatures, version 8.0 detected 52 percent of viruses in a different set of samples. Kaspersky also blocked about 60 percent of malware based solely on behaviour. The top performers scored 55.3 percent and 80 percent respectively. Version 2009 detected 98.1 percent of adware. However, PC World noted to achieve that kind of performance, users will have to modify program settings. On default settings, KIS allowed Zango to install. To block the installation, users must enable KIS to scan for \\"other malware\\". The Security Analyzer looks for operating system and program patches. It also looks for vulnerable system settings, presenting users with a list of recommended actions to prevent malware from gaining access to a system. However, PC World criticized the amount of computer jargon used and lack of information about how adjust settings appropriately. On the other hand, PC Magazine found the feature straightforward, and often the solution involved downloading and installing an update. KIS uses a whitelist by Carbon Black to classify trusted and malicious programs. Malicious programs are not allowed to run at all. Unknown programs falling in between the two categories are restricted in the actions they can perform. Its firewall blocked all attacks in PC Magazine testing. Phishing protection was introduced in this release. Testing by PC Magazine found the feature blocked 44 percent of phishing URLs. Internet Explorer 7 blocked 67 percent of the URLs, and Mozilla Firefox blocked 81 percent. Spam filtering now integrates with Mozilla Thunderbird and scans NNTP traffic. Spam can be automatically diverted to its own folder. When using an unsupported e-mail client to download POP3, IMAP or NNTP mail, Kaspersky will still generate a report of all messages. However, in an unsupported client, there will be no toolbar nor will the program classify any messages as spam in the client itself. =Version 2010 (9.0)= Version 2010 of Kaspersky Internet Security introduced an overhauled user interface and a sandbox for running applications in a virtualized environment. The 9.0.0.736 build of KIS 2010 fully supported the Windows 7 operating system. =Version 2011 (11.0)= The beta version was released for all windows users on 8 June 2010. This version included a new interface, as well as a gadget only available for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users. PC Mag rated this version \\"very good\\" (4/5 stars). Its firewall was noted to be very good, but that made up for its only adequate malware detection rates. Two critical fixes have been released by Kaspersky Lab, making the current version 11.0.2.556. =Version 2012 (12.0)= On 1 March 2011, Kaspersky released the first build of version 2012, it came out as beta version and in English, French and Russian version, with more versions due out later. On 7 June 2011 Kaspersky Lab announced the commercial release of Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 in France, Germany, Switzerland. The current version is 12.0.0.374. =Version 2013 (13.0)= The beta version was released for all windows users on 3 March 2012. This version includes an interface which looks (currently, at least) much like Internet Security 2012. There is no Safe Run option, no Proactive Defense, while instead the behavioural monitoring System Watcher seems to be taking greater responsibility for detecting malware and a Safe Banking feature has been added. The release candidate (build 13.0.1.4088 RC) was released for all windows users on 20 July 2012. The Final Version was released on 28 August 2012 build 13.0.1.4190 =Version 2014 (14.0)= Beta testing started on 12 March 2013. This version introduced a Windows 8 like GUI design. The final version was released on 3 August 2013 build 14.0.0.4651 in India and Russia, then on August 13 in the USA and August 27 in the UK. The 2014 release was frequently characterized as inferior to user expectations, largely due to its removal of a range of granular fine-tuning options in 2013 and earlier, which were used by experienced users; a number of these were added back in the 2015 beta by the time of its technical release (build 463). As of February 13, 2014 build 14.0.0.4651(E) was released. Build 14.0.0.4651(I) is the latest (current) version. =Version 2015 (15.0)= In April 2014, a beta version of the 2015 product, build 463, was released, followed by a technical release preview, of the near-complete 2015 product. The first official release of the product was in Bangladesh in June 2014. = Version 2016 (16.0) = = Version 2017 (17.0) = = Version 2018 (18.0) = = Version 2019 (19.0) = = Version 2020 (20.0) = Controversies regarding security In March 2015, Bloomberg accused Kaspersky of having close ties to Russian military and intelligence officials. Kaspersky slammed the claims in his blog, calling the coverage \\"sensationalist\\" and guilty of \\"exploiting paranoia\\" to \\"increase readership\\". As a result of alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election and ongoing investigations, the Department of Homeland Security officially banned the use of the Kaspersky Internet Security by the United States federal government in September, 2017. As of December 12, 2017, the use of Kaspersky software is banned from use by the American federal government by law.

A fan of the 1930s and 1940s, she plays vintage instruments and wears clothing and hairstyles from the period. Although she was born in England, she lived in Poland for the first five years of her life. Her album Paszport, a tribute to those who fought in World War II, won Best Concept Album from the Independent Music Awards in 2014. In 2016 she was given Poland's Pro Patria Medal. Life Carr was born in Nottingham, England to a Polish mother and a Scottish-English father, but until she was five years old, lived in Poland where her parents met and her father worked. Her English grandmother's stories about the 1930s and 40s stirred an interest in the era, as did photographs of the clothing and hairstyles. She admired Édith Piaf and female pilots Amy Johnson and Amelia Earhart. An undisciplined girl, she joined the Air Cadets, a youth group affiliated with the Royal Air Force, and learned to fly. Career = 2009: Kommander's Car= The single \\"Kommander's Car\\" was inspired by Kazimierz Piechowski's escape from an Auschwitz concentration camp. Piechowski was sent to Auschwitz in 1940. Two years later a fellow prisoner who repaired the cars of SS officers suggested they steal a car. Carr's song is about their escape. =Kazik and the Kommander's Car documentary= Kazik and the Kommander's Car is a documentary produced by Carr and directed by British film maker Hannah Lovell. It documents Carr's first visit to meet and present her tribute song, \\"Kommander's Car\\", to Polish World War II veteran Kazimierz Piechowski. Piechowski was present for the debut of the documentary, which included a concert on 27 January 2010 in Warsaw, Poland to mark the 65th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz. Two years later a DVD of the film was released. The film was shown in museums and festivals in England and Poland. =Touring and humanitarian work= In March 2011, Katy Carr and the Aviators embarked on The Escapologist Tour. Kazimierz Piechowski was present for the first two London performances. The aim of the Escapologist Tour was, in Carr's words, \\"to help unite both British and Polish communities throughout the UK through film, music and the sharing of stories.\\" Events included concerts and screenings of Kazik and the Kommander's Car, as well as outreach with Polish retirement and care homes. Carr sang Polish folk songs to World War II veterans. In 2012, the tour was nominated for the National Lottery Good Causes Awards. She embarked on a US Polish diaspora tour and performed in Chicago, and New York City. Short films about Polish history from the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum archives were shown by Hannah Lovell, director of Kazik and the Kommander's Car. Carr studied Polish at Jagiellonian University so she could communicate better with the Polish media during her tour and also to \\"help to share the joys of learning the Polish language\\". =2012: Paszport= Carr's fourth album, Paszport, contains lyrics in English and Polish. She worked with British producer Nigel of Bermondsey and with musicians from Klezmer, Gypsy jazz and Folk music to create a sound that would be both traditional and contemporary. The album was released in Poland on 17 September 2012 to mark the anniversary of the Soviet invasion, National Independence Day in Poland and Remembrance Day (also known as Poppy Day or Armistice Day). Paszport was released in the UK on 11 November 2012 to positive reviews, some considering it one of the best albums of the year. Aside from the single about Piechowski, the album's subjects include the Soviet invasion of Poland, the Polish resistance and the repression of Polish people by the Soviets. Regarding the title of the album, Carr cited a poem by Jerzy Harasymowicz: \\"it's not a very well known poem, but I think it says everything about my album, 'Masz paszport, więc jesteś' – \\"You have a passport, therefore you exist\\". In 2013, Carr was given the Polish Daily Award for Culture. In October 2020, Carr released the final part of her 'Polish Roots Trilogy' (previously Paszport and Polonia) with the album, Providence.

Born near the town Abasha, he was educated at the Kutaisi Realschule and Tbilisi State University from which he graduated in 1922. As a teenager, he was associated with the Blue Horns, a group of young Georgian Symbolists. Although he stood far from any “proletarian” thematic, he joined the nascent \\"Left\\" poets and became their spokesman. In 1924, was arrested and nearly shot on a walking-tour to Kakheti during the Red Terror that followed the Georgian rebellion against the Soviet rule. Between 1924 and 1929, he produced two series of poems (ფიქრები მტკვრის პირას [\\"The Thought at the Mtkvari\\"], 1925; მხოლოდ ლექსები [\\"Only Poems\\"], 1930) that earned him a reputation of one of the most original Georgian poets of the 20th century. In the words of modern British scholar Donald Rayfield, \\"most are energetic and provocative Whitmanesque heckling and satirizing of the older generation of poets: Chikovani sported Mayakovsky’s mantle.\\"Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 265-260. Routledge, . Since 1924, he edited the notorious Futurist journal H2SO4 and directed his attacks against his former associates from the Blue Horns group, chiefly Titsian Tabidze and Paolo Iashvili. From 1930 onward, he distanced himself from his innovative Futurism and brought his work more in line with ideologically-sanctioned patriotic lyrics and love-poetry, suppressing all reference to his versatile early work, especially during the 1937 Great Purge, in which his brother was shot. He served as a secretary of the Georgian Union of Writers from 1930 to 1932, its president from 1944 to 1951, and deputy to the Supreme Soviet from 1950 to 1954.

Biography Cirlot was born in Barcelona to Juan Cirlot and Maria Laporta. There he matriculated high school from the College of the Jesuits and worked in a customs agency and the Banco Hispanoamericano while also studying music. In 1937, he was mobilized to fight for the Second Spanish Republic. In early 1940, he was mobilized again, but this time by the pro-Franco side. He was in Zaragoza until 1943; there he frequented the city's intellectual and artistic circles and associated with the painter Alfonso Buñuel—brother of Luis Buñuel—with whom he translated the poems of Paul Éluard, André Breton, and Antonin Artaud. During this period, he read many avant-garde art books and magazines. In the summer of 1943, he returned to Barcelona to work in the Banco Hispanoamericano. He met novelist Benítez de Castro, who introduced him in the media as an art critic. On 11 August 1947, he married Gloria Valenzuela, then began to work in the editorial bookstore \\"Argos\\". He composed music and worked with the artists of the Dau al Set, a Catalan group. On 21 October 1948, he premiered his Preludio in the Ateneu Barcelonès. In 1949, his daughter Lourdes was born, and he became a writer for the Dau al Set magazine journal. In October, he traveled to Paris and met André Breton. Igor Stravinsky, his first treatise, was published. In 1951, he began to work in the Gustavo Gili publishing house, where he remained until his death. That year, he also began to collect antique swords. Between 1949 and 1954, in Barcelona, Cirlot befriended and worked with the German ethnologist and musicologist Marius Schneider, who initiated him into the science of symbology. Jose Gudiol Ricart likewise introduced him to the study of Gothic art. His work El Ojo en la Mitología: su simbolismo [The Eye in Mythology: Its Symbolism] was published in 1954. His daughter Victoria was born the same year, and he helped found the Academia del Faro de San Cristóbal. In 1958, he began to write collaborations, such as Goya, Papeles de Son Armadans, and published, through the publishing house Luis Miracle, his most famous and international work, the Diccionario de símbolos tradicionales. Years of intense activity as a critic and lecturer followed. In 1962, his father died and he published his dictionary in English under the title A Dictionary of Symbols, with a prologue by Herbert Read. In 1963, he severed ties with Dau al Set member Antoni Tàpies. In 1966, he saw Franklin Schaffner's film The War Lord, which had a great impact on his poetic work. Cirlot fell ill with pancreatic cancer in 1971, for which he underwent surgery on 11 May 1973. He died that day in his home on calle Herzegovino in Barcelona. Analysis Beginning in the 1940s, Cirlot ascribed himself to the French Surrealist school and to Dadaism, soon assuming a very broad-horizoned spiritualist tradition of universal longing (Kabbalah, Sufism, and Eastern studies). From this was sparked the interest in symbology that permeated all his literary activity and his important work as an art critic. As a member of the Dau al Set school, he was a collaborator of Joan Brossa and Antoni Tàpies. He conducted comprehensive studies on medieval symbology and hermeneutics, accruing an impressive collection of swords, and his prolific and varied poetic output—more than fifty books—remained independent of the trends that dominated the poetry of the postwar period because of their darkness and hermetism; nevertheless, his impact has never ceased to be reevaluated through continuous revisions, reeditions, appearances of unpublished works, and tributes. The best-known part of his work is the phase of his poetic evolution centered in the actress Rosemary Forsyth, who played Bronwyn in the Franklin Schaffner film The War Lord (1965) and inspired the permutational phase of his poetry. As a poet his writing ranges from playful invitations and lexical juggling acts within a general elegiac tone. There are echoes of avant-garde fantasy. Cirlot also cultivated aphorism in his book Del no mundo (1969), in which his thought can be traced back to its sources in Nietzsche and Lao Tse. In 1986 El mundo del objeto a la luz del surrealismo was published unedited. Written in 1953, it went beyond the conceptual trends of the previous decades and continues to be an essential reference for professors and students of the universe of the work of art. In 1988 88 sueños, a complete collection of the dreams transcribed by Cirlot published partially in the Catalan journal Dau al Set, was published, clearly showing the importance that the Surrealist school had on his formation. As a scholar, Cirlot is known internationally from his Dictionary of Symbols, which continues to be successfully reissued in the wake of symbologists like Carl Gustav Jung, Mircea Eliade, Gaston Bachelard, René Guénon, Gilbert Durand, and Paul Diel. One reviewer in 1962 called the book \\"a momentous contribution to symbology\\".

Built in 1874, it was the residence of Lewis Miller, founder and leader of the Chautauqua movement. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1965 for its association with Miller, and and is included in the larger Chautauqua Institution Historic District, also a National Historic Landmark. Description and history The Lewis Miller Cottage stands in the village of Chautauqua, at the northwest corner of Vincent and Whitfield Avenues. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a broad gabled roof showing Stick style woodwork and large supporting brackets. It has a symmetrical front facade, with sash windows flanking the center entrance on the ground floor, and paired sash windows on the second floor, flanking a center doorway that provides access to the second-story balcony. The first-floor porch and second-floor balcony both have gingerbread balustrades. The cottage is a prefabricated structure, built in 1874 and delivered here for Lewis Miller (1829-1899), founder and leader of the Chautauqua movement.

It stars Steve Buscemi, Michael Pitt and Alison Lohman. It is the story of twenty-year-old Toby Grace (Michael Pitt) who progresses from a homeless scavenger in New York City to the assistant of a neurotic paparazzo, Les Galantine (Steve Buscemi), then falls in love with a famous singer, K'harma. Plot Toby and Les meet when Toby interrupts a crowd of paparazzi waiting to take pictures of pop diva K'harma Leeds (Allison Lohman). Les requests that Toby go get coffee for himself and two of his colleagues. On his way back with coffee, Toby is stopped by K'harma's agents from the inside of a building and asked to see if the photographers are looking. After the photographers look away, the agents guide K'harma past Toby towards a car. The photographers catch on and rush towards the car, colliding with Toby and spilling some coffee. Later that night, Toby approaches Les outside his apartment, scaring him. He claims that he was bringing his change back from the coffee, but eventually asks to stay with him that night, saying that he is really cold and doesn't have a place to stay. The next day, Toby offers to be his assistant for free, which Les accepts. Later that night, after being thrown out of a party, Les and Toby overhear a celebrity's agent talking about where his client is getting surgery done on his penis. Toby writes down the address, and they show up there the next day. After waiting for quite some time, Les gets a shot of the celebrity, referring to it as \\"the shot heard 'round the world\\", although he only gets $700 for it. Les offers to take Toby's headshots free of charge to help him start out his dream of being an actor. Eventually, their partnership begins to wear thin after K'harma takes Toby backstage without Les, angering the latter. The next day, at Les' apartment, Toby gets a call from K'harma, who invites him to her birthday party. Toby agrees on the condition that he can bring Les along, making it up to him. At the party, however, even after agreeing not to do so, Les takes pictures of K'harma with Elvis Costello, getting him and Toby thrown out. Toby is extremely angry at Les, who feigns dropping his camera's memory card into a cup of coffee (unbeknownst to Toby, Les ejects his camera's battery instead) and offers to print up Toby's headshots and show them to a few people. The next day, Toby says his stomach hurts and that he cannot go with Les. After he leaves, Toby tries to leave after him only to find that Les has locked him in. He then walks into Les' room and gets on his computer, discovering the pictures of K'harma and Elvis Costello on it. Feeling betrayed, Toby escapes by way of unhinging the apartment door. Later, we see Toby walking through the park, seemingly homeless again, until a couple nears him. He runs up to the man, and stabs him in the stomach. The woman tries to talk him out of killing her, but forgets her line. A bell rings, and it is revealed that the park is a film set, and Toby is the lead character. Les repeatedly tries to talk to Toby by calling Toby's agent until Toby finally speaks to him. Les offers to apologize over coffee, but Toby declines. Soon, Toby professes his love for K'harma on film, which skyrockets his popularity. A jealous Les soon finds a vintage camera in his apartment, which his father gave to him. The camera is actually a hidden gun, and he resolves to murder Toby with it. At the premiere of Toby's latest film, he walks down the red carpet with K'harma. Les shows up, and raises the camera, getting ready to shoot him, but then sees him kissing K'harma, and stops. As he is trying to leave the crowd, Toby sees him and asks him to come back. They shake hands, and Les takes his picture up close. Les tells Toby to go, and Toby walks down the red carpet into the premiere. Les, although disappointed that recognition still eludes him, is proud of Toby's fame. After the credits, Les is shown on a Hollywood talk show discussing his picture of Toby, which the interviewer refers to as \\"the shot heard 'round the world\\". Reception The film received positive reviews from critics. On the website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 82% approval rating, based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 6.75/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"A funny, energetic satire of the paparazzi life and the entertainment industry, Delirious is another winner for indie helmer Tom DiCillo.\\" On the website Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 22 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

It is known as One Wall Handball.  Courtfield  International Fronton courtfield International fronton takes back its courtfield to the most basic version of the indirect style: One wall where the ball must bounce. This only wall, the fronton, is 6,10m wide and 4,90m high.

Swearing the oath allowed him to gain access to a $25,000 a year capital housing allowance to provide for living accommodations in Yellowknife. The total estimated cost to tax payers was $65,000. He was forced to pay back $10,000 of it after it was determined he did not actually live in Fort Resolution.

From September 1890 until January 1920, Nijō served as a member of the House of Peers. Together with Konoe Atsumarō, Nijō was a leader of the Sanyōkai faction within the upper house, which was critical of Itō Hirobumi’s pro-Jiyutō politics, plans for increased military expenditures after the First Sino-Japanese War, and plans for tax reform.Banno, Establishment of the Japanese Constitutional System pg.108 He later served as high priest of Kasuga-taisha, the Fujiwara clan’s ancestral Shinto shrine in Nara.

The film is about a man going to various locations in town where he flirts with the women, and they in turn get revenge on him, causing him to leave their establishment. This film is believed to have included the first cinematic instance of a comedian being hit in the face with a pie, later known as the Pie in the Face, when Ben Turpin was struck. However, the pie Turpin was hit with was hand-held, not thrown. Plot The film begins with Mr. Flip, played by Ben Turpin, in a general store, in which he flirts with the woman behind the counter, for which he is carried out of the building on a Hand truck. He travels to a manicurist where he eventually gets the pointed end of a pair of scissors, sticking up out of his chair, when he sits down. He then meets a telephone operator at her desk, he calls her on a nearby phone, and she gets revenge by shocking him with electricity, through the phone, by turning her manual generator. Next at a barber shop two women workers, get even with him by pasting his face with shaving cream and tossing him out of the building. At a bar he flirts with the bar attendants, until he gets sprayed with seltzer, by them and another patron. As the film's climax he enters a restaurant and gets a pie in the face by the waitress.

He retired in 1998 and is now an Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Sheffield. Academic career After attending Tupton Hall Grammar School Holmes entered the University of Nottingham in 1957 as a County Major Scholar to read History. After two years he changed courses and graduated in 1960 in Economic and Social History. He subsequently received a Revis postgraduate scholarship to begin work with Professor J. D. Chambers, an authority on Britain's industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries, and wrote a thesis on the life and work of H. S. Tremenheere. In 1963 Holmes was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the University of Sheffield in the Department of Economic and Social History under Sidney Pollard, then a rising star in the field of Economic History. During the 1970s the two worked closely together producing several volumes of documents covering European Economic History in the modern period. These books were: The Process of Industrialization (1968); Industrial Power and National Rivalry (1972) and The End of the Old Europe (1973). Holmes and Pollard also edited Essays in the Economic and Social History of South Yorkshire (1977 reprinted 1979). Together with Alan Booth, in 1991 Holmes edited and contributed to a \\"festschrift\\" for Pollard called Economy and Society. European Industrialisation and its Social Consequences. On Pollard's death in 1988 Holmes became his literary executor and also edited for publication Pollard's Essays on the Industrial Revolution in Britain (2000). However, Holmes is best known for his work on British antisemitism, migration and fascism. His first major contribution to this field was an edited volume, \\"Immigrants and Minorities in British Society\\" to which he contributed an essay on \\"J.A.Hobson and the Jews\\". In 1979 Holmes wrote Anti- Semitism in British Society 1876–1939, which proved to be an inspiration for the growth of research into the area of fascism and antisemitism in the interwar period. He also wrote influential articles on the British editions of the notorious Protocols of Zion. Holmes jointly founded the journal Immigrants and Minorities in 1981 and served as joint editor until 2012. He currently serves on its advisory panel. In 1998 he wrote \\"John Bull's Island: Immigration & British Society, 1871–1971\\", which is widely regarded as an authoritative text on the history of migration. It focused on a wide range of groups that entered Britain in these years, their contributions to society and the varied responses they encountered. A similar but smaller study, \\"A Tolerant Country? Immigrants, Refugees and Minorities in Britain\\", appeared in 1991. Holmes's interest in migrant groups was also evident in his contribution, \\"The Chinese Connection\\" which appeared in Outsiders and Outcasts. Essays in honour of William J Fishman (1983) which he edited jointly with Geoffrey Alderman, and his two volumes of edited source material in Migration in European History. Following his appointment as assistant lecturer Holmes later became lecturer (1965), senior lecturer (1972) and reader (1980) before being appointed to a personal professorship in the Department of History in 1989. He retired in 1998 and is now an Emeritus Professor of History in the University. During his career Holmes supervised a large number of postgraduate students, some of whom have subsequently been appointed to Chairs in British Universities, and who are often referred to as the \\"Sheffield School\\" (see Welsh History Review, June 1990. vol. 50. no. 1. p. 138). Following his retirement, in 2002 he held a Parkes Fellowship at the University of Southampton. Holmes continues with his research interests. He contributed on British Government Policy Towards War Time Refugees in M. Conway and J Gotovitch Europe in Exile. European Exile Communities in Britain, 1940–1945 (2001). In 2008 The Burton Book co-written by Geoffrey Alderman appeared in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 2015 his chapter William Joyce and the German Connection will come out in Ian Wallace (ed.) Voices from Exile. Much of his time recently has been consumed by working on his long-awaited political biography of William Joyce: Searching for Lord Haw- Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce that was published by Routledge in 2016. In 2017 together with Anne Kershen he edited An East End Legacy. Essays in Memory of William J. Fishman which was published by Routledge. In 2018 at the Migration Museum in London he was presented with a Festschrift entitled Migrant Britain: Histories and Historiographies: Essays in Honour of Colin Holmes (Routledge Studies in Radical History and Politics) edited by Jennifer Craig-Norton, Christhard Hoffmann and Tony Kushner.

The 200-acre park-like estate includes homes, a carriage house, ice house, trails, a flower garden, and vegetable garden, and it overlooks the Hudson River from a bluff. The property includes a home designed by architect Alexander Jackson Davis for Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph. An Italianate style mansion, it was completed in 1851. The estate is open to the public, tours are offered, and the site is used for weddings and parties. It includes a museum, nature preserve, antique exhibits, and a gallery showing artworks. History Henry Livingston Jr. was Locust Grove's first resident owner and named the estate after the black locust trees growing on the property in 1771 when he purchased the property from his own father. After his death his heirs sold the property to a wealthy New York City couple, John and Isabella Montgomery. They moved farming operations to the lower-lying lands closer to the river and built a cottage. Morse bought the land from them in 1847, three years after his breakthrough with the telegraph. He hired Davis in 1851 and began working with him to remodel and expand the cottage into an Italianate villa. He continued to improve the landscape around the house, which became his summer home, for the rest of his life. After Morse's death in 1872, his family spent less time in Poughkeepsie and eventually emptied the mansion and rented the estate. One of their tenants, William Young, moved to Locust Grove in 1895 and eventually bought the property from Morse's heirs in 1901. He and his wife Martha realized its historic importance and restored the mansion and gardens. They added modern amenities like central heat, and hot and cold running water, as well as a new dining room and guest bedrooms in a large north wing (the last significant renovation to the building). Family heirlooms were the foundation of the Young Family's 20,000-piece collection of fine and decorative arts, today displayed in the mansion's 40 rooms. William and Martha Young's daughter Annette and son Innis also worked to preserve and restore the house, which was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. and Annette and Innis Young also restored their great-great grandfather's home, the Locust Lawn Estate and opened it to the public as a museum in 1958. Annette Young died in 1975, establishing in her will a trust so that her house, property, and collections of paintings and decorative arts could be opened to the public. Five years later, they were. Today the estate offers guided tours, lectures and other special events. Five miles of trails, originally 19th-century carriage roads, have been built in the woods around the house. Admission to the grounds is free; there is a fee for guided tours of the mansion.
