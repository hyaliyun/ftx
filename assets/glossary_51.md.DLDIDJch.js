Origin While there had been temporary volunteer units in Orkney during the Napoleonic Wars, the popularity of the Volunteer movement in 1859 led to the creation of the 1st Orkney Artillery Volunteers) as a permanent part of the auxiliary forces of the Crown, eventually becoming a coast defence (CD) unit of the Royal Garrison Artillery. However, this unit was disbanded during World War I, the defence of the Grand Fleet's base at Scapa Flow being entrusted to units of the Regular Army. After the war it proved difficult to reform the unit, and there were no Orcadians in the Territorial Army (TA).Rollo, pp. 7‚Äì15, 26‚Äì7.Litchfield, p. 301. The worsening international situation in the late 1930s led to the expansion of the TA, including a revival in Orkney. First, a new anti-aircraft (AA) unit, the 226th (Caithness and Orkney) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery (RA), began recruiting in Orkney as well as in Caithness (on the Scottish mainland) in 1937. Then the coastal artillery unit was revived as the Orkney Heavy Regiment, RA, in 1938.Rollo, pp. 27‚Äì8. This was followed by a unit of the Royal Engineers (RE) to support the two artillery units: the Orkney Fortress Royal Engineers.Rollo, pp. 27‚Äì8.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 105, 186. The local novelist Eric Linklater, who had served in the trenches during World War I, was asked by the Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland to raise one of these units, and chose the 'Sappers'. He was commissioned as Captain and second-in-command on 16 September 1938, with Major J. Gibson as officer commanding. The unit consisted of a single company with its headquarters at Kirkwall. Its main role was to operate the electrical generators for the Scapa Flow defences and to man the searchlights (S/Ls) for both the AA and CD guns.Linklater, Tin Hat, pp. 161‚Äì2.Monthly Army List, May 1939. Mobilisation On 22 August 1939 mobilisation warning orders arrived in Kirkwall and Linklater called out his 'Key Party'. The following day full mobilisation of the TA's AA and CD units was ordered, and the Key Party quickly called in the men from isolated farms and villages to transport them to their war stations on Flotta and at Stromness. Mobilisation was completed by 00.30 on 25 August, 8 hours after receipt of the final order. When war was declared on 3 September, Scapa Flow was defended by a few hundred local Territorials.Linklater, Man on my Back, pp. 339‚Äì41.Linklater, Tin Hat, pp. 163‚Äì5. Service Formation sign of OSDEF The AA guns were in action soon after the outbreak of war when the Luftwaffe attacked the warships in the anchorage in daylight on 17 October 1939, when HMS Iron Duke was damaged, and at dusk on 16 March 1940, when the sappers' S/Ls and Lewis guns were of little use. The Fortress Engineers were also expected to defend their positions with Lewis guns and rifles in case of seaborne attack, fears of which grew after the German invasion of Norway.Collier, Chapter V.Linklater, Tin Hat, pp. 167‚Äì74.Routledge, pp. 374‚Äì5. Over succeeding months large numbers of AA gun and S/L units were moved into the islands under the Orkney and Shetland Defences (OSDEF), controlled by Anti-Aircraft Command. The fortress engineers were engaged during the winter of 1939/40 with constructing emplacements of corrugated iron and sandbags for 13‚Äì14 extra pairs of S/Ls across the islands, with hardstandings for the associated generators and huts for the crews. Later they built camps for the reinforcements, which included two full AA S/L battalions from the Lancashire TA (38th (King's Regiment) and 39th (Lancashire Fusiliers).)Linklater, Tin Hat, pp. 170‚Äì2, 179.Linklater, Northern Garrisons.Routledge, p. 401, Table LXV, p. 397.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 3 March 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/115. Disbandment In 1940 AA searchlights became an artillery responsibility, and many of the Orkney men transferred from the RE to the RA. The Orkney Fortress RE was deleted from the order of battle of OSDEF in November 1941. However, an Orkney & Shetland Maintenance Company, RE, continued to serve in the islands.Linklater, Tin Hat, p. 181.Litchfield, p. 5. As a well-known author, Linklater was soon employed by the War Office Public Relations department to write official 'instant histories' of the war, such as The Northern Garrisons (1941) which described the life of British troops stationed in remote locations, including the Orkneys.Linklater, Tin Hat, p. 185. Successor unit 10 (Orkney) Troop, RE, was formed after 2008. Currently based at the Army Reserve Centre in Kirkwall it forms part of 71 Engineer Regiment, RE, originally assigned to 236 Field Squadron (Air Support) it was placed under 124 (Lowland) Field Squadron in 2014.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 314.

Built in 1609, it is the oldest surviving dated bridge in Moray and is a Category A listed building. Description Keith Old Bridge is built of granite rubble, and spans the River Isla in a single segmental arch, linking the higher northern bank to the lower southern one, where it is widely splayed. On its eastern flank it bears a worn carving of the coats of arms of Thomas Moray and Janet Lindsay, and on the west there are date stones showing 1609, the year the bridge was built, and 1822, when repair work was carried out on it. Currently used only by pedestrian traffic, it is approximately 2.8 metres wide, with a span of 8.2 metres. History Keith Old Bridge, sometimes known as Keith Auld Brig, was built for the use of packhorses by Thomas Moray and Janet Lindsay, his wife. The couple lived close to the ford that had been in use prior to the bridge's construction, and they were distressed by the dangers involved in crossing it, so paid for a bridge to be built with their own savings. It was built in 1609, making it the oldest surviving dated bridge in Moray. It has been in constant use since that date, and underwent repairs in 1724, and again in 1822. Its role in carrying the main road across the River Isla ended in 1770 when the nearby Union Bridge was built, but it remained open for pedestrians, and stone steps were added at the southern end, probably in the twentieth century. The bridge was designated a Category B listed building in 1972, and upgraded to Category A in 1988.

It was constructed by the architect Tevdore Taplaisdze, who laid foundation of the church in 906 as related in a Georgian inscription on the building. The church is a three-nave basilica, which, despite later reconstructions, has largely preserved its original architectural features. The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. After the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the Georgians lost access to the church and services there were restricted by the South Ossetian authorities.  Location and status  The Eredvi church of St. George is located in the village of Eredvi in the Lesser Liakhvi valley, 5 km northwest of the city of Tskhinvali. The village, whose recorded history goes back to the 14th century, was part of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast in Soviet Georgia, remained under the Georgian control after the 1991‚Äì1992 South Ossetia War, and was overran by the Russian and South Ossetian forces in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. During the August 2008 hostilities, the curtain wall of the Eredvi church was partially damaged. According to the United States Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report for 2014, the South Ossetian authorities did not permit services in the Georgian Orthodox churches, such as Eredvi. In 2017, the largely ruined village Eredvi, deprived of its ethnic Georgian population, was completely demolished by the South Ossetian authorities with the Russian aid. The church was reported standing untouched by the Tskhinvali-based South Ossetian media and a local video blogger. The church was placed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia in 2007. It is protected as part of the Greater Liakhvi Valley Museum and Reserve, whose administration, after the 2008 war, is based in exile in the Verkhvebi neighborhood of Gori and is tasked with collecting information on cultural monuments in South Ossetia left beyond Georgia's control.  History and architecture  The Eredvi basilica is enclosed within the complex of a ruined fortress, which consists of a rampart‚Äîirregular rectangle in shape‚Äîand two towers to its northwest. The towers, one of which in ruins and the other rising three storeys, are dated to the 13th‚Äì14th century; the rampart was reconstructed in the 18th. By the 18th century, both the fortress and the church were in possession of the Princes Pavlenishvili. The church was deemed to have been \\"miraculous\\" as reported by Prince Vakhushti and was described by the 1826 French Dictionnaire g√©ographique universel as the site of an yearly pilgrimage. The basilica, which measures 13 √ó 21 metres, is built of hewn stone and is roofed with tiles. It is a modified three-nave design, peculiar for the early medieval Georgian architecture, and defined by the art historian Giorgi Chubinashvili as \\"three-church\\" basilicas. These are a series of churches, in which the nave is completely separated from the aisles with solid walls, in order to create what are almost three independent churches. An ambulatory at Eredvi envelopes the church from all four sides, including the eastern fa√ßade, a feature unusual for the contemporaneous churches of this type, which usually had an ambulatory running on three sides. The main nave is divided by prominent pilasters into two nearly equal parts. The vault over the middle nave is supported by arches. The arch of a semicircular apse is two- tiered and somewhat horseshoe-shaped. The apse itself is lower than the central chamber. The entrance to the church is from south, and additionally, from the west. The window and doors are decorated with carved stone headpieces and crosses.  Inscription  The Eredvi basilica contains an engraved inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, placed in the upper part of a round column on the southern wall. It is made in the name of the architect Tevdore Taplaisdze and dates laying the foundation of the church to 906. The text makes mention of contemporary lay and clerical dignitaries, such King Constantine III of Abkhazia, who had recently conquered the wider region of Kartli from its Bagratid rulers, Ivane Tbeli, member of the great noble family of Kartli, and Bishop Stephen of Nikozi, the church's patron. The inscription, further, relates Constantine's victorious campaign against Hereti and his reduction of the fortress of Vejini in that country.

The entrance is exposed on a cliff of andesite reddish (at a height of about 300‚Äì400 m above the base of the rock). The cave of Bethlehem is mentioned by Vakhushti Batonishvili in his work Description of the Kingdom of Georgia.  History  The first mention of the cave that contains a Georgian chronicle Kartlis Tskhovreba, according to which a hundred young people of Khevsian soldiers hid, of the soldiers of Timur Leng who approached them, in this cave of the treasure of the Queen Tamara of Georgia and for fear of secret disclosure, they killed each other. According to a group of researchers, the most recent visitors had left the cave temple about 100 years ago. Not far from the cave, the monks' cells, a tombstone, a stone cross, and a pillar were found carved into the rock. These findings led to the conclusion that the cave was the oldest and tallest \\"temple of Christians in a mountain cave\\" in the world, and that the monastic complex dates from the 6th to 7th centuries.  Cave discovery  In his diary entries, mountaineer Levan Sudzhashvili in 1947 noted that he saw a cave with an iron gate and a descending chain in a rock northeast of the top of Kazbek. In January 1948, a group of mountaineers led by Alexandra Dzhaparidze explored the cave, finding a 5.5-meter long hanging metal chain at the entrance. The cave had a dome-shaped vault, rounded walls and a paved floor with square tiles.

It was built in Moscow in 1900‚Äì02 by the architect Fyodor Schechtel. It is also known as the Ryabouchinsky House, for the young Russian industrialist and art collector who built it. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Ryabouchinsky family emigrated to France. In 1931 the Soviet government offered the house to the writer Maxim Gorky and his family. It was his home until his death in 1936. The widow of Gorky's son continued to live in the house until her death in 1965. It then became the Gorky Museum, dedicated to his life and work. It is located in the historic center of Moscow, at 6 Malaya Nikitskaya. Admission is free. History = The Ryabouchinsky House - Construction = Stepan Ryabushinsky, who commissioned the house (c. 1900) The house was designed and built 1900-1903 by the architect Fyodor Schechtel for the wealthy Russian banker, industrialist and newspaper publisher Stepan Ryabouchinsky, who at the time of construction was only twenty-six years old. His father, or peasant origin, had built an industrial empire, based on textile mills and many other businesses, and shared by his nine sons. Stepan himself was also an art patron who assembled a noted collection of Russian icons. In addition to being patrons of the arts, the family members were Old Believers, an Orthodox doctrine condemned by the official Russian Orthodox Church. The design of the building included a small Old Believer Chapel hidden discreetly under a corner of the roof. Contemporary Russian critics praised Schektel's design for its \\"boldness\\" and \\"courage,\\" although they noted that the massive entrance porch and large windows on the first floor were inconvenient and illogical.Ivonne d'Axe, \\"Sovremennaia Moskva,\\" Zodchii, 1904, no. 18:213; and Vladimir Apyshkov, Ratsional'noe v noveishei arkhitekture (Petersburg, 1905), p. 54, cited in Brumfield. The building led to other more important commissions for Schechtel, including the Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station, his largest Moscow work. The Ryabouchinsky family continued to prosper and expand its enterprises. In 1916, they constructed the first automobile factory in Russia. But in 1917, following the Russian Revolution, all the property of the family was seized by the Bolsheviks. The Ryabouchinskys left behind their home and departed Moscow for Italy. Stepan died in Milan in 1942. Dzhondzhukova, E.A., \\"\\"Arkhitecturniye Sokravischiou Moskvi - Osobnyak Ryabushinskovo (2014) p. 93-101 = Soviet Period to the present= Stalin with Gorky (1931) After the Revolution the house was occupied by a series Soviet state institutions; a committee for relations with foreign communist parties; the state institute of psychoanalysis, and then a kindergarten. In 1931, Stalin and the Soviet government offered the house and a dacha in the suburbs to Maxim Gorky, the most famous living Russian writer, who was living in Sorrento, Italy, but regularly visited Moscow. Gorky accepted and occupied the house with his family until his death in 1936, though after 1934 he was not permitted to travel abroad. Stalin and other Bolshevik leaders visited Gorky in the house several times before his death. Gorky and his son lived on the ground floor, while the rest of his family lived on the upper two floors. Following Gorky's death, Nadejda Pechkova, the widow of Gorky's son, was allowed to occupy several rooms until her death in 1965. Then the house officially became the Gorky Museum, displaying objects related to his life and work.  Architecture  =Facade= The design of the house and interior is a blend of the 'Style Moderne', the Russian term for Art Nouveau, and elements of the symbolist movement of the end of the 19th century. The asymmetric forms of the roof contrast with the curving forms of the mosaic frescoes, the portals, the frames of the windows, and the balustrades of cast iron. The iron decoration over the entrance suggests a tree, while the wrought iron balustrade around the base of the house has spiral forms, suggesting waves. The facade of the house combined elements of Moderne with traditional Russian forms. The massive concrete front porch, for example, looked like the entrance of a cave or grotto, but also resembled the \\"kryltso\\", the ceremonial porch Russian churches of the 17th century. and the small narrow windows on the right upper floor resembled those of a \\"terem\\", a medieval style of Russian residence. The elaborate wrought ironwork and colorful ceramic decoration was both Art Nouveau and a recollection of medieval Moscow palaces. The wrought iron decoration on the facade also had a marine theme, resembling fish scales, while the design on the mahogany front door had lotus ornaments made of brass.Brumfield (1991) pg. 31 In addition, the facade was decorated with glazed hollow bricks, a backdrop for iron railings and large windows with wooden mullions. The most colorful element of the facade was the mosaic frieze of Iris flowers against clouds and blue sky.Bromfield (1991) pg. 31 File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫ –†—è–±—É—à–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ 1900.jpgView of the house in early 1900s File:M Dmitrovka Ryabushinsky Schechtel detail.jpgSouth facade decoration File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫ –°.–ü. –†—è–±—É—à–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ. –Æ–∂–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∞—Å–∞–¥. –û–∫–Ω–æ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ –æ—Ç –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–∫–∞. 2015-08-12 13-25-34.jpgWindow on the south facade File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫ –†—è–±—É—à–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ04.JPGFacade mosaics of Iris flowers against blue sky File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫ –°.–ü. –†—è–±—É—à–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ. –Æ–∂–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∞—Å–∞–¥. –ü–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–∫. –ë–∞–ª–∫–æ–Ω. 2015-08-12 13-23-22.jpgBalcony decoration on south facade =Interior - Entrance hall, Stairway and the Medusa Lamp= The plan of the interior was organized around a central element; the three-story staircase. The major rooms of the house all open onto the stairway. Its main feature is the highly sculptural stairway whose the railing is made of an aggregate of cast concrete mixed with marble and granite fragments, highly polished. The fIts smooth, curling forms suggest waves of the sea. The glass and brass lamp at the base of the staircase is pure Art Nouveau. It takes is the form of a medusa or jellyfish, on the stairway is pure Art Nouveau, and seems to float above the staircase. A red marble column emphasises the verticality of the staircase. It rises to the top of the house to the central skylight. Its capital is decorated with sculpted snakes and other reptiles. The stairway is lit by both natural light from above, and through three vertical panels of stained glass that rise the height of the building. The lighting effect on the ground floor is that of being at the bottom of the sea, an effect emphasized by the Medusa lamp, and the filtered light coming from above. The setting is highly theatrical; the sea- bottom effect had been introduced in Moscow in 1896 in the stage design for the opera Sadko by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in a scene in which the hero descends to the bottom of the sea, to the realm of the Sea King, and returns to the surface with enormous wealth.Brumfield, William Craft, Fedor Shekhtel - Aesthetic Idealism in Modernist Architecture, Chapter Four, pg. 131-139 The entry hallway from the front door to the stairway of the house also picks up the motif of waves, both in the brass door handles and in the ceramic floor.Brumfield, William Craft, Fedor Shekhtel - Aesthetic Idealism in Modernist Architecture, Chapter Four, pg. 131-139 File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫ –°.–ü. –†—è–±—É—à–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ. –ü—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–∂–∞—è. 2013-07-28 12-56-26.jpgThe entrance hall with wave pattern ceramic floor File:–û—Å–æ–±–Ω—è–∫ –°.–ü. –†—è–±—É—à–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ. –ü—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–∂–∞—è. 2018-06-06 14-56-38.jpgDetail of the front door handles File:Moscow.

Emma Timbery (c.1842 - 26 November 1916) was a Mulgoa Aboriginal Australian shellworker and matriarch. She was also known as the \\"Queen of the Illawarra\\", \\"Queen of La Perouse\\" or \\"Granny Timbery.\\" Her shellwork became part of a family tradition that continues to the present day. Timbery was also a Christian convert and active in the Christian Endeavor Society in La Perouse. Timbery also acted as a cultural informant about her language, Dharawal.  Biography  Timbery was born on the Georges River at Liverpool, New South Wales. She spoke Dharawal and was originally known by her stepfather's last name, Lond or Lownds. At the age of ten, she was taken to live with Mr. and Mrs. Edward Hill in Surry Hills, New South Wales. There, she began attending Sunday School regularly. She married George Timbery, an Aboriginal fisherman, in 1864 in Botany Bay. She and George had 11 children together. The couple had moved to La Perouse by 1882 where Timbery was able to make extra money creating shell baskets. Timbery's shellwork was displayed on a regular basis and sold annually in Sydney at the Royal Easter Show. Timbery's work is part of the \\"early phase\\" of La Perouse shellwork. In 1910, her shellwork was displayed in London. Timbery was revered in the community, known as \\"Queen of La Perouse\\" or \\"Granny Timbery.\\" Timbery was also a skilled fisher, and on at least two occasions, in 1876 and in the early 1900s, a boat was provided for the community to enable them to catch their own fish. The boat provided in 1876 was named the \\"Queen Emma\\", in honour of Timbery. Timbery was also an informant on her own culture, working with the anthropologist R.H. Mathews, who was studying the Dharawal language and culture. Maria Nugent writes that Timbery's \\"information has been essential for the preservation and revival of the Dharawal language.\\" Timbery, who had become a Christian convert in the early 1890s, was also involved with Christian missionaries at the La Perouse Aboriginal settlement and also with the Christian Endeavor Society. Timbery was elected as vice president of the Christian Endeavor Society branch in La Perouse. Timbery was close to missionary, Retta Dixon and the two women worked together. It was believed by the community that Queen Victoria had left lands to Timbery, but the paperwork had been destroyed in a fire. Timbery died in La Perouse on 26 November 1916 and was buried in Botany Cemetery. She left behind a long family legacy of arts with her grandson, Joseph Timbery, noted as a boomerang maker and women in her family continuing to do shellwork. Her great-granddaughter, Esme Russell, has won awards for her shellwork.

Between 1966 and 1968, at the request of John Willis Hurst, he became a cardiology fellow at the Emory University in Atlanta. His interest in medical photographs led him to produce more than 24 articles on the value of images in the diagnosis of a number of diseases. In 1968, he co-authored an article with Hurst, titled The Hand and the Heart, illustrated with clinical pictures of findings in the hands of people with cardiovascular disease. They demonstrated, using a \\"Sherlock Holmesian approach\\", how the condition of the heart might be revealed by clues in the hands. The article made international headlines. In 1970, a faculty position at Piedmont Hospital was created for him by Hurst, and Silverman subsequently established its first cardiology program. Eight years later, he was made professor at Emory. At Piedmont, he also created one of America's earliest patient education libraries, started programs to help people learn about heart disease and its prevention, and for over 25 years directed Piedmont's coronary care unit. He made significant contributions to a number of books including British Cardiology in the 20th Century (2000), a collection of 867 quotations by Sir William Osler in The Quotable Osler (2002) and J. Willis Hurst: His Life and Teachings (2007). In 1979, Silverman became president of the Georgia Chapter of the American Heart Association. In 2000 he was elected president of the American Osler Society, and in 2001 his work in British medical history was rewarded with a fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine. The Mark E. Silverman Endowed Chair in Cardiology and Education was established in his name. Early life and education Mark Silverman was born on June 21, 1939, in Springfield, Ohio. His father was a grocer. In 1959, he graduated from Ohio State University and then gained admission to the School of Medicine at the University of Chicago. In between his junior and senior years at medical school, during one summer, he attended Guy's Hospital in London, where he became interested in both clinical signs and the history of medicine. He received his MD in 1963 and returned to Ohio State to complete his internship and residency. Here, he was inspired to pursue a career in the specialty of cardiology by cardiac catheterisation pioneer James V. Warren and academic cardiologist John Willis Hurst, who was a visiting professor at Ohio State and the chief of medicine at Emory University in Atlanta. Career =Emory University Hospital= Emory University Hospital Front Entrance Silverman became interested in medical photography and produced a collection which drove him to publish more than 24 articles on the value of images in the diagnosis of a number of diseases. Between 1966 and 1968, at the request of Hurst, he became a cardiology fellow at the Emory University in Atlanta. In 1968, he wrote two articles with Hurst, one called \\"The mitral complex: Interaction of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the mitral annulus, mitral valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles\\" and the other titled \\"The Hand and the Heart\\", a topic Silverman also presented to the Laennec Society of the American Heart Association. The article was illustrated with 24 pictures of findings in the hands of people with cardiovascular disease. They demonstrated, using what they described as a \\"Sherlock Holmesian approach\\", how the condition of the heart might be revealed by clues in the hands. He begins with a quote from Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887): > Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the > history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile > as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and > teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger-nails, by > his coat-sleeve, by his boots, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of > his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuffsby each of > these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. That all united should > fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost > inconceivable.Silverman, Mark E., \\"The Hand and the Heart\\". The American > Journal of Cardiology November 1968, Vol.22 It made international headlines. Subsequently, Silverman co-authored a section on inspection in the second edition (1970) of Hurst's classic cardiology textbook The Heart. He remained affiliated with the Emory for the rest of his medical career, teaching students, nurses and residents. =Piedmont Hospital= After spending two years in the United States Air Force, Silverman returned to a faculty position in 1970, which was created for him by Hurst, and Silverman subsequently founded the cardiology programme at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Hurst later recounted: > We rotated cardiology fellows through Piedmont Hospital for twenty-five > years. The experience they gained there was rewarding, as they learned a > great deal from Silverman and other physicians. I never had a trainee who > did not think more of the subject and the profession after working with > Silverman. He was the only consultant cardiologist at the Piedmont for eight years, during which time he was responsible for the cardiac stress test, echocardiography and electrophysiology units, and the cardiac rehabilitation and exercise centre. By 1978, he was a full professor at the Emory and became involved in the founding of a number cardiology services at Piedmont. He was an advocate of preventive medicine and founded the Nicholas E. Davies Community Health Information Center, one of America's first libraries for patient education. In 1980, he published Heart attack, what's ahead? A manual for patient/consumer health education, a booklet for people with coronary heart disease that sold millions of copies, the royalties from which went to the American Heart Association. In 1991, he was appointed founding chief of the Fuqua Heart Center at Piedmont. He directed Piedmont's coronary care unit for over 25 years. =Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine= Wellcome Building In 1998, Silverman became an academic fellow at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine in London, where he spent six months researching and writing a book titled British Cardiology in the 20th Century, for which he was awarded a fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians. Silverman authored a number of articles, chapters and five books. These included papers on British cardiologists, such as Paul Wood, inspired by his time at the Wellcome in London. In 2003, he co-authored a collection of 867 quotations by Sir William Osler in The Quotable Osler. The influence of history also meant that when teaching new medical students, he would incorporate history of medicine by dressing as William Harvey and then read from De Motu Cordis. Honors and awards In 1979, he became president of the Georgia Chapter of the American Heart Association and in 1986, received the Georgia Governor's Award in the Humanities. Silverman was governor of the Georgia Chapter of the American College of Physicians (ACP) between 1995 and 1999 and was elected president of the American Osler Society for 2000-2001, and for both these organisations, he designed their ties. In 2001, his work in British medical history was rewarded with a fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine. In Atlanta, Silverman founded its Forum of Cardiology, Medical History Society and its Echocardiographic Society. Personal and family In 1969, Silverman married Diana Howard. They have two sons, Joel and Adam. Death and legacy In his final years, Silverman had been suffering with a rare disease of nerves, which caused him disturbing nerve sensations including the feelings of excessive heat and electric impulses. He described these symptoms as \\"like being in a vat of boiling oil, plus electric shocks\\" and found it notable that he \\"who had such an interest in teaching about rare diseases, would have such a rare disease that no neurologist had ever seen\\". He died unexpectedly on November 12, 2008. The Mark E. Silverman Endowed Chair in Cardiology and Education was established in his name, and a tribute is held at Piedmont Heart every year. The Mark Silverman award is presented to a physician involved in the Georgia Chapter of the ACP who \\"has demonstrated excellence in bedside skills and teaching\\" and \\"served as an inspiration for younger physicians to advance their knowledge and training in medicine.\\" Selected publications Silverman authored more than 200 medical articles and a number of books. =Books= *Electrocardiography, basic concepts and clinical application.

It is a trace fossil and thus evidence of activity, rather than a body fossil. Detail of levees in flaring portion of trail of Myxomitodes stirlingensis. Description Myxomitodes stirlingensis are irregular markings on the surface of beds, with the superficial appearance of animal trails. They are problematic for such trails because of their great geological age. Unlike fossil trails made by slugs or worms, Myxomitodes flare and vary in width. Worm and slug trails are long, so generally run off the edges of rock slabs. Myxomitodes in contrast is short, with one end tapering and the other forming a bulbous structure. Cross section of a small ancient gully with Myxomitodes fossils in the Stirling Range Formation of Western Australia. Reconstruction of paleosols and life on land in the 1900 billion year old Stirling range Formation of Western Australia. Biological affinities Myxomitodes stirlingensis is a problematic fossil of controversial biological affinities. At first it was interpreted as a trail of a soft-bodied worm-like animal, and then as a trail of wind blown bubbles. Later it was suggested to be a trace of a giant globular, marine amoeba, similar to Gromia. Discovery of a variety of paleosols associated with Myxomitodes suggests that it might have lived on land like dictyostelid slime molds. These are dispersed soil amoebae for most of their life cycle, but occasionally stream together to form a grex, or slug-like multicellular aggregate that moves a short distance to form a sporulating stalk. This explanation explains the flaring shape (from cellular aggregation), levees (from slime trail), short length (migration distance) and bulbous ends (base of sporulating stalk).

His ability to play cello was praised by Hector Berlioz. He studied music in Italy with Luigi Cherubini and returned to Russia where he became a patron of the arts. He supported Mikhail Glinka who would become Russia's first major composer and entertained Robert and Clara Schumann on their visit to Russia. Schumann dedicated his Piano Quartet to Wielhorski. Early life The Wielhorski family home was located near the palace of Grand Duke Michael, whose wife Elena Pavlovna hosted a political and musical saloon. Matvei's brother Mikhail Wielhorski was a composer. There was no conservatory in Russia during those days, so Wielhorski and his brother studied in Paris under Cherubini. When they returned to Russia they were given positions at the Tsar's court and, as members of the aristocratic class, became patrons of the arts. European music like Mozart and Beethoven, composers that the Wielhorski's held in high regard, had come to Russia by way of the salons, such the one hosted by Grand Duchess Pavlovna, and The Philharmonic Society. Pavlovna introduced Matvei to Anton Rubinstein. Composers =Glinka= The Wielhorski's provided rehearsal space for Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar. Trained in Italy, Glinka became Russia's first major composer. A Life for the Tsar has been described as \\"patriotic and very monarchist\\", with a story by Vasily Zhukovsky and libretto by the Baron G. F.

This machine is the first product of MV Agusta's ‚ÄúReparto Veicoli Speciali‚Äù (RVS) (Special Vehicles Operations) department, and a reinterpretation of the MV Agusta Dragster. It is powered by a 150 bhp (110 kW) version of the company's 800 cc three-cylinder engine. The machines are all hand assembled and went on sale in 2019. Background MV Agusta's CEO, Giovanni Castiglioni, set up a new division, the RVS, to design special and premium models. The first project was a reinterpretation of the Dragster. The machine was designed in conjunction with the C.R.C. (Castiglioni Research Centre) who provided the engineering expertise. Technical details =Engine= The 799 cc engine, originally designed by Ezio Mascheroni and first fitted to the F3, uses a DOHC inline three-cylinder layout with four valves per cylinder. A counter-rotating (reverse) crankshaft is used, which counteracts the centripetal forces of the wheels allowing the bike to turn faster. The bore and stroke are 79 mm and 54.3 mm. Modified to meet the Euro4 European emission standards and tuned to produce 150 bhp (110 kW) at 12.800 rpm, the engine is the most powerful triple in the MV range. Power is fed through a six speed gearbox via a hydraulic slipper clutch. The gearbox is fitted with a quickshifter. =Cycle parts= As is usual for MV Agusta the frame is constructed of chrome-molybdenum tubing with an aluminium swinging arm mounts, and the engine acts as a stressed member. Marzocchi ‚ÄúUpside down‚Äù front forks are fitted which have a DLC (diamond like carbon) coating to reduce wear. The single sided swinging arms is controlled by a fully adjustable Sachs shock absorber. The front brakes use distinctive SunstarBraking Batfly twin discs and Brembo radial 4-pot calipers with a single 2-pot Brembo caliper on the rear. Wheels are from Kineo with red highlights to the wire spokes. Carbon fibre is used for many of the bodywork component.

A month after setting up an Abwehr branch at the H√¥tel Lutetia in occupied Paris in June 1940, Colonel Friedrich Rudolf summoned Brandl there and made him head of the offices financing and protecting agents. Known as Abwehrstelle or Ast, the Abwehr had bases in the occupied zone of France at Saint-Germain- en-Laye, Angers, Bordeaux and Dijon. By spring 1941 it was a success, employing 400 people. Everything was done without bills, without knowing the name of the seller or the origin of the goods. The transactions were made in cash. When southern France was also occupied in November 1942, three new bases were set up in Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse.

By 2007, plans were proposed to close the aging school building in the face of declining enrollment and the potential to save City Schools $6 million in maintenance and capital expenses. The school was also among five Baltimore schools that were identified as \\"persistently dangerous\\" under standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act. The school board approved a plan to close Hamilton Junior High in the summer of 2009 by a phase out plan where it would not admit new 6th graders. City Neighbors first opened an elementary/middle school in the former Hamilton Junior High building under the name City Neighbors Hamilton in 2009, and plans were made to add a high school in another part of the building the following year.

The film involves the painter Saint Simon (John Phillip Law) who loses his sanity after the death of his wife. Along with his butler Hermann (Gordon Mitchell) , they meet a young pianist named Sybille (Brigitte Christiensen) who resembles his dead wife home to their castle. After Saint Simon discovers that blood from a murder victim re-inspires him artistically, he orders Hermann to seek out more women for him while Sybille is held captive in the castle. Plot After the death of his wife Christine, the painter Saint Simon begins to lose his inspiration and his sanity. With the help of his butler Hermann, Saint Simon exhumed the corpse of his dead wife. Later, at an exhibition of his work Saint Simon meets a young pianist named Sybille who closely resembles Christine. He invites the woman to his castle hoping it will cause his inspiration to reappear. The presence of the woman initially fails to inspire his art, but after Saint Simon discovers that Hermann has attempted to rape a young woman and has killed her. Saint Simon discovers that the blood is the right colour he require for his paintings. Saint Simon sends Hermann to go after Sybille's friend Corinne whose is murdered with her blood drained for Saint Simon's art. Sybille is imprisoned in the castle left to be the next victim to Hermann and Saint Simon until her fiance Gerard arrives to save her. Production Blood Delirium was director Sergio Bergonzelli's first attempt at a gothic horror film in his three-decade career which spanned working in Italy, France, Turkey, Spain and Greece. The director was predominantly making pornography for most of the decade and had only returned to feature film work with this erotic thriller Tentazione. Bergonzelli is credited as Peter Storage in the films credits. In an interview in 1996, Bergonzelli stated he wrote the film with Fabio De Agostini although De Agostini is not credited in the credits. De Agostini had previously worked with Bergonzelli on previous scripts including Silvia e amore and In the Folds of the Flesh Among the cast was John Phillip Law who took on the role to work again with his friend Gordon Mitchell. Law spoke negatively about the film later, \\"That one, yes, is extremely bad. When my Italian agent found out I had starred in it, he practically exploded. \\"John, you can't make movies like that! Don't you take yourself seriously?\\" The rest of the cast included Olinka Hardiman who also appeared in Tentazione in one of her rare non-hardcore pornography roles. The film was shot in the 13th century castle of Pereto in the Abruzzo region. Release Although Blood Delirium was submitted to the Italian ratings board where it passed with a V.M.14 rating on 8 August 1988, the film was released direct-to-video in Italy by the distributor Azzurra.

Established under the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act as a relief measure for the province's impoverished M√©tis people, the wooded Wolf Lake settlement supported a population of 58 settlers in 1940. However, it was withdrawn in 1960, causing its M√©tis inhabitants to disperse. History The Great Depression saw much deprivation among the nomadic M√©tis population of Alberta, estimated at about 11,000 in 1936. A royal commission was formed to investigate the living conditions of Alberta's \\"half-breeds\\" (as the M√©tis were known), who were then squatting on road allowances with no ready sources of cash income, or trapping in remote areas without access to education or health services. M√©tis children in urban areas were driven away from public schools by the ridicule and humiliation of white pupils, with an estimated 80% of the provincial M√©tis population receiving no education whatsoever. This Ewing Commission saw agriculture, particularly stock-raising, as the means by which the M√©tis could be made into \\"self-supporting citizens\\". Farm colonies, in which the M√©tis themselves would provide most of the physical labour, would be a suitably inexpensive relief scheme for the cash- strapped Alberta government to implement. Following these recommendations, the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act enabled unoccupied Crown land to be set aside for the creation of new M√©tis settlements. Eleven were originally created by Order-in-Council through 1938 and 1939 - Wolf Lake, Utikuma Lake (now Gift Lake), Cold Lake, Marlboro, Keg River (now Paddle Prairie), Big Prairie (now Peavine), Touchwood, Goodfish Lake, Elizabeth, Fishing Lake, and East Prairie. The Wolf Lake settlement was established thirty miles north of Bonnyville, including Wolf Lake and several smaller lakes. With commercially viable fish stocks, an abundance of timber, and connection to Bonnyville and Lac La Biche ensured by all-year wagon trail, only the agricultural suitability of the settlement was in doubt. Covered mostly in grey clay \\"not of a highly productive nature\\", Wolf Lake was estimated to have a modest carrying capacity of \\"not more than seventy or eighty families\\". A 1941 report of the Alberta Bureau of Public Welfare recorded a resident population of 58 inhabitants, with a lumbering operation active and a school under construction. Besides the cost of surveying the area, and $10 spent on seed, the colony had incurred no expense to the provincial government. The Province withdrew the settlement in 1960, causing most of the settlers to disperse. But one Wolf Lake settler, Isadore Cardinal, refused to leave, living and trapping in the former settlement area until at least 1989. The M√©tis settlers' cemetery still exists at the site today. Alberta Parks also operates a campground on the south shore of the lake. Geography The Wolf Lake settlement consisted of approximately five townships, enclosing most of Wolf Lake and Seibert Lake. =Legal land description= The original boundaries of the Wolf Lake settlement, as described in its enabling legislation, are as follows: A second Order-in-Council expanded these boundaries on April 18, 1939.

Glerum (August 16, 1939 - June 26, 2014) was an American theatre consultant and author, best known for his book, Stage Rigging Handbook, Jay O. Glerum was widely recognized in the technical theatre circles as the author of the Stage Rigging Handbook, referred to by many stagehands as the bible of the industry. Published by Southern Illinois University Press and continually in print since 1987, the book has been revised each decade to stay current with the rapidly changing field of technical theatre. As president and founder of Jay O. Glerum & Associates, Inc., Glerum was an independent consultant to a wide band of entertainment venues in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia‚Äîfrom amusement parks and performance halls to historic theaters and arenas. He worked with architects and engineers on renovations and new theater buildings and inspected rigging-systems for hundreds of venues. Alone or working with other rigging specialists he taught safe rigging master classes to thousands‚Äîboth academics and professional stagehands‚Äîin Europe, Asia, and North America. Glerum's work as an educator and advocate of standardized techniques for stage rigging led him to be considered at the forefront of improved safety for theatrical riggers and stagehands. His passionate dedication to backstage safety was influential in the establishment of the current formalized safety standards for stage rigging. Early life Born Jay Otis Glerum, Jr., on August 16, 1939, in Washington D.C., he lived with his parents, Catherine and Jay Otis Glerum, Sr., in Evanston, Illinois and Marinette, Wisconsin for the first nine years of his life. The family then moved to the Washington D.C. area, where he graduated from Wheaton High School (Maryland) in 1957. In high school, Glerum became a student of technical theatre and was hired upon graduation as a theatre technician for the summer season at Olney Theatre in Olney, Maryland. He subsequently was hired as the lighting and sound guy for the Catholic University National Players 1957-58 Tour. As the youngest person ever hired at that time by what then was known simply as ‚ÄúThe Players,‚Äù Glerum toured Germany, Austria, and Italy, entertaining U.S. military troops with Romeo and Juliet and The Taming of the Shrew. That same season, he also toured thirty-six U.S. states with them. Not only did Glerum set up sound and lights for each venue, he drove the truck hauling scenery, props, and costumes and also played small parts in both plays. After completing two years in pre-engineering at Montgomery Junior College in 1960, he worked as a U.S. postal carrier while also serving as the technical director at Marjorie Webster Junior College in (1960‚Äì61) and Dunbarton College of the Holy Cross (1959-61), both in Washington D.C. He then transferred to the University of Washington in 1961 where he earned his B.A. (1963) and M.A. (1965) from the School of Drama. Personal He met his future wife, Sara ‚ÄúSallie‚Äù Johnsone, at the University of Washington. They married in September 1962 in Seattle, Washington. Together they raised four children. The family moved to Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where they lived from 1972 until 1986, at which time Glerum and his wife returned to the Seattle area where they lived until his death in 2014. Professional Glerum was hired as an assistant professor in Seattle University's Drama Department in the School of Arts and Sciences in 1965 after serving as its part-time stage carpenter and designer for two years, during which he worked full-time at the USPS. As the sole earner for his growing family, he moonlighted during the mid-1960s and early 1970s with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union (IATSE) Local 15 in Seattle as a part-time extra. During academic breaks, he worked for the Seattle Repertory Theatre as a stage carpenter and served as the technical director for Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre (ACT) for its 1970 summer season. He accepted a faculty position at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1972 where he was an assistant professor and technical director for the Drama Department of Marquette's School of Speech. In that capacity he oversaw technical requirements of the soon-to-be-built Evan P. and Marion Helfaer Theatre, consulting on both front- of-house and backstage design for the teaching and performance spaces. Determined to continue interacting and working with tech-theatre professionals in order to provide students with accurate, up-to-date curricula, he also worked as part-time extra for IATSE Local 18 in Milwaukee. In 1980 Glerum joined Peter Albrecht Company, Inc., a Milwaukee company known for its design and manufacture of custom stage rigging systems where he was a project manager and stage system designer. In that capacity, he designed technical systems for venues in the U.S., South America, and Asia, working with architects and engineers. It was during this period that he began writing Stage Rigging Handbook, having witnessed first-hand for more than two decades what he considered a universal need for stage-rigging safety protocol. In 1986 he joined the University of Washington faculty as a lecturer and head of its graduate Technical Theatre program, and he and his wife returned to the Seattle area. Soon after the release of Stage Rigging Handbook in April 1987, he founded his company, Jay O. Glerum, Inc. on July 15, 1987, to sort out the increasing demands for his services as a consultant. On April 4, 1990, he amended the company's name to Jay O. Glerum & Associates, Inc., to better represent collaborations done when he contracted with other specialists in the entertainment industry. He remained the company's only employee, however, for the duration of its existence. While Glerum was at the University of Washington, campus development and strategic placement of new buildings meant the removal of its small arena theater, the Penthouse, built in 1939 by the WPA and the first theater-in-the-round in America. The idea for theatre in the round had been conceived by Glenn Hughes, head of the Drama Department at the University of Washington from 1930 to 1961. Demolition of the Penthouse was scheduled to make way for a new Physics Building in1990. Glerum recalled hearing from Hughes, then an Emeritus Professor, that the Penthouse was designed to be movable, and only when Glerum researched and located the original plans in the UW archives, did the possibility of saving the Penthouse become a reality. The University revamped its plans for the small 165-seat theatre's demolition and agreed to move it to a different location on campus. It was subsequently refurbished, renamed Glenn Hughes Penthouse Theatre, and was reopened in its new location on campus in 1991. As Glerum's work became nationally recognized, he resigned his position at the University of Washington in 1992 to be a full-time consultant to the entertainment industry, focusing on inspecting rigging systems, consulting on new construction and renovation of theaters, teaching rigging seminars for professional stagehands, and training employees of entertainment parks and performance centers. In its early years, the company also accepted expert witness work, but by 2000 he had eliminated that side of the business. He dissolved the company, a Washington State corporation, effective Feb. 24, 2014. When he turned sixty, Glerum determined that he wanted to spend the remainder of his working life focusing on safety inspections and master classes. To that end, he would cease consulting with architects and engineers on construction and renovations of physical theater buildings. To close out that part of his career, he accepted his last consultancy project for Main Stage Theatre in Olney, Maryland (which was completed in 2000), the venue of his first foray into professional theatre with the Catholic University Players. Although he accepted fewer jobs after entering his seventies, Glerum remained engaged and passionate about his work and never retired. He upheld his agreement to teach a pre-conference two-day master class for United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT) at the March 2014 conference in Fort Worth, Texas, despite a terminal illness. He died in June of that year. Honors Glerum was active in USITT for more than forty years, joining in 1973 and serving on the Board and Technical Production Commissioner in the 1980s. He received the Joel E. Rubin Founder's Award in 2001 and the Health and Safety Award in 1992, and he was elected a Fellow of USITT in 1995. Jay was elected to IATSE 80 in Los Angeles as an honorary member (never having worked for long enough periods of time to qualify as a full-time stagehand‚Äîan essential qualifier for union membership), an honor which touched him deeply. He didn't travel to Los Angeles have the membership bestowed on him in person, so he could not be considered a member of IATSE. Legacy Jay O. Glerum Masterclasses with specific workshops for entry- level, intermediate, and advanced stagehands are offered through USITT each summer. They were established in 2016 to honor Glerum's passion for rigging safety and training.

Foreign refugees  A result of Syrian Civil War is on the refugees who seek asylum in Syria from neighboring conflicts: Refugees of Iraq (1,300,000), Palestinian refugees (543,400), and Somalia (5,200). April 2012, within Syria, there were 100,000 refugees from Iraq, 70,000 more already returned to Iraq. Circassians in Syria have been returning to their historic homelands in Circassia. The Chechen and Ossetian diasporas in Syria have also sought to return to their Caucasus homelands.  Conditions against return  The UNHCR stated that conditions in Syria are still unsafe and destitute, improvements in many areas are uncertain and many basic services are absent; access of aid convoys is also a challenge. Less than a half of the returnees have access to water or health services, due to extremely damaged infrastructure. An estimated 10 per cent ended up as internally displaced persons once again. = Destruction = The incidences of damage, assessments are based on actual physical conditions, as seen on the satellite images from January 2017. Syrian urban centers served as battlegrounds. The major populated cities Aleppo (important to the economy as the main place for industry and finance), Damascus, Homs and also many smaller towns faced with the low intensity conflict (on and off fighting lasted months), which caused the breakdown of partial or entire urban systems. Destruction lead to the collapse of economic activities in many areas as public service‚Äìrelated infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals) is destroyed. Infrastructure such as bridges, water resources, grain silos, and other economically significant assets were used as a battle positions and consequently became strategic targets. Destruction of homes. In 2011, Syria was rapidly urbanizing with 56% of the population living in urban areas (population density: 103 inhabitants/km2). Most urban areas are either in rain-fed agricultural regions, or in the basin of the Euphrates River. Remaining urban areas are along the interior trade routes. In 2006, 92% of the population had access to improved sanitation (96% urban and 88% rural) and 89% had access to improved water sources (95% urban and 83% rural). Damascus and Aleppo, the two largest cities, accounted for nearly 37% of the urban population and hold 20% of the total population. In 2010 Syrian census, 4,128,941 conventional dwelling units existed. In 2017, around 72.6% (from 56%) of the population (13.7 million people) was living in the urban areas. Homs and Aleppo were directly impacted (violence, destruction, and the collapse of basic services) and experienced an exodus. Other areas (promising relative security and consistency of services) had experienced large influxes. The net result was a significant concentration of the population (internally displaced persons and their hosts) in urban areas. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license In 2017, at the city level (city boundaries, no suburbs, no towns, etc) conflict had an impact (bombed, shelled, gunned etc) in an estimated total of 316,649 housing units. Aleppo at the top of list with 64% impact, followed by Homs at 16%. Across the 10 most populated cities, 27% of the housing had impact (7% destroyed and 20% partially damaged). 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license Across Syria (that is eight governorates that had active conflict) statistics translates into an estimated 220,826 residential units destroyed and 649,449 partially damaged. Destruction in health care. Before the conflict, physical infrastructure capacity in Syrian health care was below the averages of regional countries. Syrian health care showed regional variance within Syria (better at one place, but not others). 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license Hospitals became specifically targeted places of attacks. Physicians for Human Rights documented attacks on 400 facilities (some multiple times) and the deaths of 768 health personnel between March 2011 and the end of July 2016. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license United Nations Security Council Resolution 2286 (3 May 2016) condemned the attacks on medical facilities and personnel. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2268 (26 February 2016) asked to grand health support (access to humanitarian workers). As of 2016, 14 hospitals and 57 medical centers in Aleppo corresponding to 35% destruction on pre-conflict structures. As of February 2017, almost 9 in 10 health facilities in Raqqa (partially damage 80%) and Dayz az-Zawr (partially damage 79%) suffered some form of damage. As of February 2017, across Syria (that is eight governorates that had active conflict) 68% of all medical centers, 84% of specialized medical centers, 75% of medical points, and 51% of all polyclinics experienced some form of physical damage. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license According to Physicians for Human Rights, at least 15,000 of Syria‚Äôs 30,000 physicians have left their positions. As of 2014, Aleppo had fewer than 70 where 6,000 physicians were in the city at pre-war. More people may have been killed (women who died in labor because she required a C-section, or the men who had a heart attack and died because lack of a medication, or elderly person who died as a result of complications from diabetes that was not managed) in Syria than KIA due to a breakdown of the health system. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license Destruction in educational structures. In 2009, Education in Syria had primary net enrollment rate (NER) of 93% and the enrollment gender gap was negligible. In the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, Syria ranked 32 and 39 of 49 countries for eighth grade science and mathematics, respectively. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license Education facilities became military bases, schools used as military quarters and informal shelters for displaced people. Vocational institutes (14.5%), secondary schools (14.7%), and education offices (33.3%) were the highest targeted educational structures. Aleppo (fully destroyed 49), Da‚Äôra (fully destroyed 21), Raqqa (fully destroyed 7) and Tadmur (fully destroyed 7) had destroyed educational facilities. Kobani, Homs, Douma, and Daya Az-Zawr had 5 or fewer facilities fully destroyed. The conflict caused damage to numerous historic buildings, tell mounds and archaeological locations, including all six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. List of heritage sites damaged during the Syrian Civil War. Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since 2014. = Syrian law 10 = The Syrian government has put forward a law commonly known as \\"law 10\\", which could strip refugees of property, such as damaged real estate. There are also fears among some refugees that if they return to claim this property they will face negative consequences, such as forced conscription or prison. The Syrian government has been criticized for using this law to reward those who have supported the government. However, the government denies this and has expressed that it wants the return of refugees from Lebanon. In December 2018, it was also reported that the Syrian government has started to seize property under an anti-terrorism law, which is affecting government opponents negatively, with many losing their property. Some people's pensions have also been cancelled. = The war economy = Ongoing conflict for many years, stop the functioning of the formal economy, capital moved out, and state weakening in much of Syria have predictably given rise to war economy.Hamoud Al-Mahmoud, ‚ÄúThe War Economy in the Syrian Conflict: The Government‚Äôs Hands-Off Tactics,‚Äù Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, December 15, 2015, http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/12/15/war-economy-in-syrian-conflict- governments-hands-off-tactics-pub-62202 .

The import restrictions are promulgated, consumers have restricted choices of goods. Export restrictions imposed which caused decline in markets and investment opportunities. Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, the Syrian economy has been hit by massive economic sanctions restricting trade with the Arab League, Australia, Canada, the European Union, (as well as the European countries of Albania, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, and Switzerland) Georgia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. West already took steps to block any activity in Syria, there are further steps. In January 2019, the EU added 11 people and five entities to its sanctions list. The U.S. Congress planning a rigorous Syria sanctions bill.  Conditions for return  The Syrian foreign minister called on the country's refugees to return home. Mr President Assad has asked refugees to return, and he claimed host countries abusing foreign aid. = Stability/security = The attempts to find/bring stability began in late 2011. As of 2019, Syrian peace process and De-escalation are ongoing efforts.  Peace process  The Arab League launched two initiatives, but without much success. The Syrian peace process is the ensemble of initiatives and plans to resolve the Syrian Civil War and spills beyond its borders. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 was unanimously adopted on 18 December 2015, which calls for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria. Financial Times reported that returning Syrian men either risk death in the military or risk the prison network. Human rights groups have documented widespread torture and abuse of detainees part of Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War.  De-escalation As of 2019, there were Safe Zones, along with their ceasefire areas, established in Syria in order to halt fighting. These agreements were set to expire in every 6 months with possibility of continued renewal. = Reconstruction = 2016, World Bank estimated the reconstruction at $226 billion. 2019, the United Nations estimated the reconstruction at $250 billion. While the war still ongoing, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad claimed that Syria will be able to rebuild the war-torn country on its own. , the reconstruction is estimated to cost a minimum of US$400 billion. Assad claims to be able to loan this money from friendly countries, Syrian diaspora and the state treasury. In 2019 Atlantic quoted a diplomat: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm told that before the war, the capital budget was $60 billion, and last year the capital budget was $300 million, of which only 20 percent was actually spent. Not only does it not have the money, but they don‚Äôt have administrative [or] political capacity to build the country.‚Äù ' ‚Äì Iran has expressed interest in helping rebuild Syria. International donors have been suggested as one financier of the reconstruction. , reports emerged that rebuilding efforts had already started. It was reported that the biggest issue facing the rebuilding process is the lack of building material and a need to make sure the resources that do exist are managed efficiently. The rebuilding effort have so far remained at a limited capacity and has often been focused on certain areas of a city, thus ignoring other areas inhabited by disadvantaged people. ' ‚Äì In 2019, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated his country's contributions to Syrian reconstruction were helping to improve the humanitarian crisis. Moscow investment in the Syrian energy sector accompanied other footholds in other sectors such advance deals for power generation projects in Homs, a rail line linking Damascus International Airport to the city center, and an array of industrial plants that will play an instrumental role in Syria‚Äôs future development. ' ‚Äì There would be ‚Äúno reconstruction without [a] political transition,‚Äù a French embassy spokeswoman recently told to Atlantic. Referenced to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for ‚Äúcredible, inclusive and nonsectarian governance ‚Ä¶ free and fair elections ‚Ä¶ to the highest international standards of transparency and accountability...‚Äù NGO ‚Äì In 2019, International donors pledged $7 billion, including $397 million from the United States, for the civilians. The Atlantic Council‚Äôs published \\"Rebuilding Syria\\" program, which was developed requesting information from officials of the US government and some other specialists, including development experts, their own policy analysts, and some partner governments which is not in conflict with US.  Countries declared safe return  ' ‚Äì Denmark has reclassified Damascus as safe. Voluntary return movements of refugees As of 2012, more than 5,000 returned to Syria between July and August, while most were moved to newly built camps that hosted 7,600 refugees by November. As of mid-2017, an estimated 260,000 refugees returned to Syria since 2015 and more than 440,000 internally displaced persons returned to their homes, to search for family, check on property and, in some cases, due to improved security in parts of the country. =Lebanon = Lebanon hosts 929,624 as of 2019 Since 2011, Lebanon has taken Syrian refugees. Lebanon has seen 2.2 million estimated arrivals as of December 2015. In 2015, Lebanon stopped the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from registering Syrians. May 2019, 301 refugees were summarily deported as an official decision to send back refugees entered after April 24. The Lebanese refugee policy is driven by a slowing economy and high unemployment. = Turkey = Turkey framed its generosity in bestowing money or gifts toward Syrians fleeing the civil war as a moral duty (Islamic duty). In August 2019, Turkey began imposing restrictions on where in Turkey Syrians could live.

British by birth, Sisley was unable to fight in the Franco- Prussian War and - fleeing the Siege of Paris - he first stayed at Louveciennes in autumn 1870, at which time he painted First Snow at Louveciennes (Boston Museum of Fine Arts), showing rue de Voisins, near Renoir's mother's house in the hamlet where he had set up his studio. He also produced a series of paintings showing the peak of the side of the C≈ìur- Volant. In spring 1871, with Paris in the control of the Commune, Sisley again took refuge in Louveciennes, this time at 2 rue de La Princesse. He found his studio ransacked by the Prussian troops, meaning few paintings of Louveciennes from before 1871 survive.

In 1497, he enlisted the men of Devon and Cornwall to suppress Perkin Warbeck's rebellion and was involved in the relief of Exeter. In 1513 he accompanied Henry VIII to France where, in recognition of his bravery, he was made knight banneret. In 1520 he was present with Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He died in 1539, having married twice. His first marriage was with Jane, the daughter and heiress of James Dernford of West Stonehouse and widow of Charles Dynham of Nutwell, Devon, with whom he had 3 sons, including his heir Richard Edgecumbe and 4 daughters. He married secondly by 1525, Catherine, the daughter of Sir John St John of Bletsoe, Bedfordshire and the widow of Sir Griffith ap Rhys of Carmarthen. The diplomat Ralph Sadler admired Catherine's gravity, and in July 1543 advised Henry VIII to send her to Scotland to join the household of Mary, Queen of Scots at Stirling Castle, under a provision of the Treaty of Greenwich. This plan was cancelled by the War of the Rough Wooing.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 230 as \\"Lady Edongcomb\\".

The crackdown was described in June 2018 by a United Nations special rapporteur as taking place \\"on a wide scale across\\" Saudi Arabia; the special rapporteur called for the \\"urgent release\\" of the detainees. Six of the women arrestees were tortured, some in the presence of Crown Prince advisor Saud al-Qahtani. Background According to Clarence Rodriguez, the 2018‚Äì2019 crackdown can be considered as following from a wave of arrests in September 2017 of intellectuals and moderate clerics, including the arrests of Abdulaziz al-Shubaily, a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA); Mustafa al-Hassan, an academic and novelist; and Essam al-Zamel, an entrepreneur. Rodriguez described the September 2017 arrests as constituting a campaign of political repression by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS), in reaction to which Jamal Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia for exile in the United States. Arrest waves Rodriguez described the 2018 arrests of the women activists as a \\"detonator\\" of the reputation of MBS as a reformer, arguing that MBS aimed to claim the credit for dropping the women driving ban. =January‚ÄìJune 2018= Noha al-Balawi was detained in January 2018, the first in a 2018 wave of arrests of women's right activists involved in the women to drive movement and the anti male- guardianship campaign. She was questioned during her detention about her women's rights activities. In mid-May 2018, all three of Aziza al-Yousef, Loujain al-Hathloul and Eman al-Nafjan, together with Aisha al-Mana, Madeha al-Ajroush and two male activists, were arrested by Saudi authorities. , more anti male-guardianship campaigners had been arrested, bringing the total to 13. , four of the women had been released. Nouf Abdelaziz was arrested on 6 June 2018 after expressing support for seven of the activists arrested in May. Mayaa al-Zahrani was arrested later in May after she published online a letter written by Abdelaziz for release if arrested. Hatoon al-Fassi, a women's rights activist and an associate professor of women's history, was arrested around 27 June, not long after she had driven a car following the official lifting of the women's driving ban. The wave of political arrests in 2018 extended beyond women's rights groups to other individuals making political statements against Mohammad bin Salman's policies. Economist Essam al-Zamil was charged with terrorism as a result of questioning plans involving the national oil company. Political prisoners were held without trial, and public figures, such as Salman al-Awdah, were \\"wanted dead\\", according to The Economist. Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi, co-founder of the Saudi Arabian human rights organisation Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), who had already been held in prison from 2011‚Äì2015, was arrested on 24 May 2018. , Al Jazeera English stated that nine of the activists, out of a total of 17, remained under arrest without contact with their families or lawyers. Al- Yousef was released from prison, without the charges against her being dropped, in late March 2019. , Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sada remained under arrest, while several of the other detained women had been released while their trials continued. =April 2019= Twelve people, a pregnant woman and eleven men, involved in women's rights activities or supportive of the imprisoned activists were arrested on or around 4 April 2019. The arrestees, including two United States (US)‚ÄìSaudi binational citizens, Badr al-Ibrahim and Salah al-Haidar, son of Aziza al-Yousef, were seen as not being \\"front-line activists\\", in the sense that they were not politically active on Twitter and were rarely quoted in non-Saudi media. Other April detainees included writers Khadijah al-Harbi and her husband Thumar al- Marzouqi, Mohammed al-Sadiq, Andhullah al-Dehailan, Naif al-Hendas, Ayman al- Drees, Abdullah al-Shehri and Moqbel al-Saqqar. Fahal Abalkhail, who had supported the women to drive movement was also among the arrestees. King Saud University lecturer Anas al-Mazraoui was earlier arrested in March after having stated the names of some of the imprisoned women's rights activists during a human-rights panel discussion at a book fair. , a total of 14 of the March/April detainees remained imprisoned without charge.  Torture  Samar Badawi, al-Yousef, al-Nafjan, al-Hathloul, Shadan al-Onezi and Nouf al-Dosari were tortured during the detention, with Crown Prince advisor Saud al-Qahtani present at some of the torture sessions. Physical torture techniques included beating the women on their feet, giving them electric shocks and whipping them. The torture location was referred to as \\"the hotel\\" or \\"the officer's guesthouse\\". One of the women was photographed naked, one was sexually harassed, beaten and groped, one was stripped naked in front of interrogators. Several had black eyes, suffered from trembling, and were unable to walk or stand normally. One was told falsely that a family member had died. Testimony of torture was obtained independently by ALQST, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Some of the women have testified about their torture in court. Aims of the crackdown Human Rights Watch (HRW) interpreted the arrests as being aimed at frightening the activists, stating, \\"The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince's [human] rights agenda faces time in jail.\\" The arrested campaigners were severely criticised in semi-official media as \\"traitors\\". Social anthropologist Madawi al-Rasheed interpreted the May arrests as being part of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's aim to keep all the credit for allowing women to drive starting from 24 June 2018. Rothna Begum of HRW said that since the arrests and the public smearing of the activists' reputations, women's Twitter activity was quiet. ALQST described the series of arrests as \\"unprecedented targeting of women human rights defenders\\". In June 2018, United Nations special rapporteurs described the detentions and arrests taking place as a \\"crackdown\\" taking place \\"on a wide scale across\\" Saudi Arabia and called for the \\"urgent release\\" of the detainees.  International support for the detainees  On 2 January 2019, a group of UK members of parliament and international lawyers requested permission to visit the women detainees. However, there was no response from the Saudi ambassador Prince Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz. The UK panel that included former Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee Crispin Blunt concluded that the female detainees had been subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, including assault, threats to life and solitary confinement. On 14 May 2019, one year after the women human rights activists were arrested by the Saudi authorities, Amnesty International criticised Saudi Arabia's western allies, including the US, the UK and France for not doing anything for the \\"immediate and unconditional release\\" of the activists.

The Puustellinmets√§ mass grave was a mass grave that was located in Puustellinmets√§, Suutarila, Helsinki, Finland. It was created during the Finnish civil war in 1918. The remains of the bodies in the grave were transferred to the Malmi Cemetery in 1971. History On the final day of the Finnish civil war, on 15 May 1918, there was a shooting incident in Tapanila, in which a White Guard man named Karl Lindstr√∂m was killed. Who shot him or what the exact circumstances were, was never found out. Also the chain of events during the reprisals is unclear, but it seems likely that members of the White Guard in Malmi apprehended numerous members of the Red Guards, who were taken to the Malmi Police Station for interrogation. At least some of the apprehensions were conducted in a random way, by apprehending men at the Tapanila Station who were going to travel to work by train in the morning. The following night, on 17 May 1918, some of those apprehended were put on a march to the Puustellinmets√§ Wood, where they were shot and then buried in a mass grave. The identities of those shot are not known with certainty. After World War II, local working class organizations arranged an annual memorial march from the Tapanila square to the site of the mass grave. It seems that this tradition came to an end in 1971 at the latest, when the remains of the bodies were transferred to the Malmi Cemetery. At that time, ‚Äúseven complete skeletons and some separate bones where found in the grave‚Äù. A memorial was erected on the site of the mass grave in October 2012.

She earned her MD‚ÄìPhD at the University of Pennsylvania, where she trained in the laboratory of Carl H. June, developing methods to expand T-cell populations, for medical therapies. She completed residency in Internal Medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from 2006 to 2008. She completed fellowship in Hematology and Oncology at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 2008 to 2012.  Research and career  In 2012 Maus returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where she became an assistant professor and director of translational medicine. Since 2015 Maus has worked in the Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana‚ÄìFarber Cancer Institute. Here she leads the Cellular Immunotherapy Program which translates her research into clinical trials for patients with malignancies. Maus develops chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for cancer patients. She demonstrated that it is possible to use engineered CAR-T cells to identify and kill tumour cells that express a specific protein, EGFRvllI (variant III). She believes that using CAR-T cells in combination with checkpoint inhibitors used to treat other cancers. The cells can breakthrough the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, infiltrate a tumour and illicit an immune response. Maus has used CRISPR-Cas9 to develop the CAR-T cells that incorporate a molecule called Bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE). Bi-specific T cell engager continues to produce short-lived molecules that attack the tumour until it is destroyed. BiTEs contains two molecular arms, one which catches an antigen EGFR target on the tumour cells and the other locates a CD3 receptor of a nearby T cell. Once the target and T cell receptor are close to one another it can destroy the cancer cell. The BiTEs force the tumor and T cells together. Usually BiTE is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier, but as CAR-T cells can pass through, they can produce the BiTE inside the brain. Maus is on the leadership team of MicroMedicine, a start-up which creates automated microfluidics for targeted cell isolation from biological fluids. Maus was awarded a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Stage 2 fellowship to develop CAR-T cells that can target abnormal antigens made from oncogenes.

It is based on interpretations of the United States copyright principles of fair use and copyright exhaustion. Proponents argue that CDL is legal under those principles because it relies on digital rights management (DRM) to ensure that any library-owned digitized work that is in copyright is loaned for a limited period of time, and that a one-to-one ratio of owned copies to borrowers is maintained. However, opponents have criticized this interpretation, arguing that CDL involves copying, not mere lending, and that a library's purchase of a physical book does not entitle it to produce and lend an e-book or distribute digital copies. Development A precursor to CDL was the \\"Digitize and Lend\\" program begun in 2011 by the Open Library, a program of the Internet Archive. Also in 2011, the basic principles of CDL were articulated by Michelle Wu in her paper Building a Collaborative Digital Collection: A Necessary Evolution in Libraries. The use of the term \\"Controlled Digital Lending\\" to refer to this concept first appeared in the Position Statement on Controlled Digital Lending, published in 2018 alongside a white paper explaining their legal arguments. CDL is increasingly being considered by a number of libraries and is being followed by library organizations across the United States as well as in other countries. The Internet Archive has gathered together 12 stories from their blog about libraries that are engaged in aspects of CDL. Lisa Petrides argues that in terms of school libraries, CDL is a positive step forward, but does not go far enough.  Mechanism  One of the core activities of a library is to loan materials, and proponents argue that CDL is a modern digital extension of this function. With CDL, a library takes a physical copy of a legally acquired item and digitizes it. After digitization, DRM is applied to the digital version, and the physical item is then made unavailable for loan. The library catalog record is usually the mechanism to give access to the digital loan, so the record is changed to point to the repository where the digital copy resides. In this way, there is only one copy being loaned for each copy owned by the library. After the loan expires, the DRM software removes the previous borrower's access and the book is available for loan to another patron. Opponents of CDL argue that CDL is not like lending, which does not require copying, and dispute the claim that only one copy at a time is available for reading. Opponents say that CDL involves first making an unauthorized digital copy of a printed edition of a work, and then making an additional unauthorized digital copy for each \\"borrower\\". Opponents also argue that unencrypted digital copies are distributed for viewing in a Web browser, and that these copies can be retained, viewed, or printed from the browser cache even after the e-book is marked as \\"returned\\" and is available for \\"lending\\" to other readers.  Controversy  Authors' and publishers' groups have questioned the copyright interpretations that underlie CDL. In early 2019, the National Writers Union and a coalition of forty national and international organizations and federations of writers, photographers, visual artists, translators, publishers, and reproduction rights organizations released a statement entitled \\"Appeal from the victims of Controlled Digital Lending (CDL)\\" that claimed that CDL \\"violates the economic and moral rights of authors.\\" In a news article in Publishers Weekly The American Association of Publishers is quoted as stating that CDL \\"'denigrates' the incentive copyright provides for authors and publishers.\\" The Authors Guild relies on the case of Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc., which established that ReDigi could not resell digital music, to argue that libraries would similarly be prohibited from loaning digitized version of books that were legally purchased, and argues that CDL results in lost sales.

He defeated George Jackson by 11,556 votes to 1,736, and won the post. However, Davies became concerned about Wilson's absence from union affairs, as Wilson focused on forming a non- political union for miners. While the NUS voted to fund Wilson's venture, Davies sought legal advice, and found that voting irregularities and a lack of notice of the vote might lead to issues. He decided to allow an injunction to stop its activity until a special general meeting was held. Wilson was angry at this, believing it was part of a plot by Joe Cotter to take over the union. Wilson accused Davies of negligence and incompetence, and arranged for Davies to be suspended until the union held its annual general meeting. In September, Davies instead resigned as general secretary, and was soon expelled from the union.

Iusnaturalism is a theory of law, which holds that legal norms follow a human universal knowledge on justice and harmony of relations. Thus, it views enacted laws that contradict such universal knowledge as unjust and illegitimate. Modern theorists considered as iusnaturalists include Hugo Grotius, Immanuel Kant, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Franz von Zeiller, among others. This school of thought became popular during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance amid the attempt to identify \\"the relation, if any, of the ius gentium to natural law in the Aristotelian-Thomistic sense.\\" This issue had covered the role of God and the adequacy of reason without divine grace, among others particularly in the field of legal theory as it established the notion that natural law could exist without religion.  Concept  Iusnaturalism is associated with the notion of natural law proposed by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, and Samuel von Pufendorf. It emerged from the view that emphasizes how the ideas of nature and divinity or reason are the sources of the validity of natural and positive laws. It is also linked to the general theory of law, which has been viewed as one that has positivist character, aiming to be objective and non-normative. For iusnaturalists, in order for a law to be accorded the status of legal or one that has a binding effect on people, it must be fair. Some scholars distinguish iusnaturalism from legal positivism but it is noted that both are concerned with the good law. Iusnaturalism subordinates power to law as well as positive law to higher laws, giving it a more meaningful primordial metanarrative of natural law. One of the fundamental notions of iusnaturalism is that man is free and no one has power over other men or moral power over another without a mutual act of will. Failure to understand or recognize this would lead to conflict.  Variations  Iusnaturalism has different variations and these are based on religious and rational perspectives. Two of the most important are classical iusnaturalism and rationalist iusnaturalism. Classical iusnaturalism is associated with theorists such as Saint Thomas Aquinas, who maintained in his Treatise on Law that the universal laws of justice have a divine origin. Rationalist or realist iusnaturalism emerged during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a consequence of the process of secularization, which affected the relationship between Christianity and international law. Thinkers such as Grotius, Hobbes, and Kant maintain that the shared laws of justice are not revealed by God to humans but can be accessed by reason through an understanding of human nature. This type of iusnaturalism integrates natural law and positive law as species of the same genus since they share one principle of common validity - political power. Moderate iusnaturalism is also another variant, which emphasizes how natural law exists together with positive law within a legal dualism that rejects all monisms as well as the so-called extreme iusnaturalism. The extreme type holds that \\"natural law exists and all that exists is natural law\\". It also recognizes that morality is one of the traits for characterizing what law is.

Her research focus is on the evolution, assembly and data curation of protozoan parasite genomes, particularly Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium.  Biography  Kissinger obtained her PhD at Indiana University in 1995. During her PostDoc she worked with David Roos to help establish the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database (EuPathDB) series of genome collections, including the malaria specific PlasmoDB, for easy querying and access by scientists. Since its launch in 1999 the database has accrued 9TB of data, has been received renewed grant contributions by the NIH at every funding cycle, and now receives 6 million searches a year from 13,000 individuals. Most recently Kissinger and Roos were awarded a grant that is expected to total US$23.4million for maintaining the resource. The success of EuPathDB has led to the creation of Clinical Epidemiology Database (ClinEpiDB) based on the same framework, alongside Christian Stoekert and Christiane Hertz-Fowler. In 2008, while an associate professor, she was made a National Associate of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. She helped to establish the Institute of Bioinformatics at the University of Georgia and then became director. In 2016 she was awarded the Richard F. Reiff Internationalization Award by the University (alongside fellow professor Rose Chepyator-Thomson) for her international collaborations, opening up data internationally, and for being a member of the steering group for the West African International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research at the National Institutes of Health. Beyond the creation of databases, Kissinger focuses on the analysis and comparison of parasite genomes. Using genome assemblies from across the Apicomplexa (which includes malaria and toxoplasmosis parasites) it was shown that genetic synteny (genes arranged in the same groupings in different genomes) was substantially less than expected from animal genomes, suggesting that the parasite genomes have undergone major rearrangements or that their most recent common ancestor is more ancient than previously thought. In 2012 her lab helped develop a computational tool, MCScanX, to identify synteny across genomes, which has been cited >650 times. Kissinger continues to make big data obtained from investigations into parasites as accessible as it can be. The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center, a collaboration with Emory University, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and headed by Mary Galinski, is embarking on a major project to characterise many thousands of malaria-mammal associations and Kissinger is involved in converting this data into a format that can be used by everyone. She said of the project: \\"The goal of my team is to integrate the terabytes of data being produced on both the host and the parasite and make it accessible to our mathematical modelers, who are looking for patterns and signals, as well as the global malaria research community to guarantee that this large investment has the biggest impact possible on malaria research\\".

The Alexandre Chavchavadze complex was approved by the decree of the President of Georgia in 2006, under the category of Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Importance of Georgia.  History  The history of the Tsinandali Chavchavadze complex originates in the 17th century when Heraclius I resettled the ancestors of Chavchavadzes from the village of Chavchavadze, to strengthen the village. In 1680 they settled in Tsinandali. In 1797, Heraclius II of Georgia donated to Garsevan Chavchavadze (Georgian Ambassador to Russia), together with Tsinandali, the villages: Zegaani, Napareuli and Muganlo. The first building was built in 1818, and in 1831 the second. In 1829, the water pump was built and obtained 12 hectares of the wooded area, where the garden- park was made in 1835 by European decorators. In 1840, Alexander Chavchavadze built a winery. Its name is associated with the introduction of new vines and the implementation of technological innovations in winemaking, the highly regarded dry white Tsinandali, is still produced there. By this period, the romantic poet's hometown became a meeting place for the main Georgian and European cultures. Mansion of Prince David Chavchavadze in Tsinandali After the death of Alexander Chavchavadze in 1846, the land of Tsinandali was inherited by his son David. In 1854, during the Shamil attack in Tsinandali, the palace and the library were destroyed along with part of the park. Family members of Aleksandre Chavchavadze were kidnapped. This event shocked not only Russia, but also the West. On March 22, 1855, after complicated negotiations, the hostages were exchanged for Shamil's captive son, Jamal al-Din, and 40,000 rubles of silver as part of an agreement involving a general exchange of prisoners.Gammer, Moshe (1992), Muslim resistance to the tsar , pp. 272-4.

The next day, on August 2, 2019, the bill was passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Trump. This act increases spending by $320 billion over levels set in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and removes the possibility of budget sequestration.  Appropriations legislation  On September 26, 2019, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019 () which contained a continuing resolution lasting until November 21. On November 21, Congress passed the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Further Health Extenders Act of 2019 () which extended temporary funding until December 20.

The home and business place of banker William Duff of Braco from 1703 to 1722, the house has borne his name ever since. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1970. Description Braco's Banking House, at 7 High Street in Elgin, is a south-facing three-storey town house of three symmetrical bays, with crowstepped gables on each side, and fronted by an arcade of three round-headed arches on the ground floor. It has a harled exterior, with ashlar detailing. Each bay on the first floor has a small, twelve-pane sash window, and the two outer bays on the second floor each have a window, raised through the eaves of the roof, with carved stone pediments, the western one dated 1694 with initials I D and a thistle finial, the eastern one decorated with a star and a fleur-de-lys and initialled M I. The roof is of stone slabs, and there is a two-storey wing at the rear. History Built in 1694, the house was owned by the Coxtons of Innes; initials above the second floor windows represent John Duncan and Margaret Innes. From 1703 to 1722 however, the house served as the home and place of business for William Duff of Braco and Dipple, for whom it is named. Duff and his brother Alexander enriched themselves by lending money to estate owners in a period when harvests were poor. Many landowners in Scotland had lost money on the Darien scheme, and when lenders defaulted on their loans, the brothers would take ownership of the properties that had been offered as security. In this way, Alexander acquired the Braco and Balvenie estates, and when Alexander's son committed suicide in 1718, William inherited the estate of Braco, and continued to lend and acquire more properties. He acquired such a reputation that the Earl of Kintore is reported to have prayed \\"Lord, keep the Hill of Foudlin between me and Braco.\\" William's son, also called William, went on to become the first Earl of Fife. The house has continued to be used as a residence and place of business since it was built. In 1971, it was designated a Category A listed building, and in 1975 it was restored and reharled by Meldrum & Mantell. It is currently in use as a shop, with a flat above it.

Fenci (1914‚Äì1999) was an Italian-American artist and arts educator, best known for his bronze sculpture. He worked in 1942 as a New Deal artist with the United States Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture.  Biography  Fenci was born in Florence, Italy on 18 November 1914. At a young age he went to study art at the Royal Institute of Art. He received a master's degree in 1932 from Instituto d'Arte Firenze (Art Institute of Florence) and studied with sculptors Libero Andriotti and Bruno Innocenti.

After graduating from the Institute of American Indian Arts and Northeastern Oklahoma State University, she became an art teacher, first working in the public schools of Dewey, Oklahoma. When Josephine Wapp retired as the textile instructor at the Institute of American Indian Arts, Wilson was hired to teach the design courses. After three years, in 1979, she returned to Oklahoma and taught at Chilocco Indian School until it closed and then worked in the Morris Public School system until her retirement in 2009. In 1976, Wilson and her sisters formed the Fife Collection focusing on designing contemporary fashion, but incorporating traditional Southeastern Woodlands techniques and motifs. Their works were shown at many museum venues and festivals, like the Coconino Center for the Arts , Southern Plains Indian Museum, and Red Earth Festival. Her later career has included works of traditional Creek split-cane baskets, shell carvings, and fingerweavings. Wilson has participated in numerous art and fashion shows throughout her career, winning first place honors in 1972 at the Scottsdale National Indian Arts Exhibition, the Grand Heritage Award of the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in 1995 and placing 2nd in the traditional objects category of the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2016. Early life Sandy Fife was born in 1950 in Dustin, Oklahoma to Carmen (n√©e Griffin) and James Fife. She grew up on her grandfather's allotment which sits on the border of the Hughes County-Okfuskee County line. The youngest of six children, she came from a long line of artists and teachers. Her grandfather was a wood and stone carver, her father drew with colored pencils and chalks, and from the time she was ten years old, her mother, who was a teacher, taught her fingerweaving. Fife attended Graham High School in Weleetka, Oklahoma and then went on to further her studies at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1965 to 1969. At the institute, she studied with world-renowned artists and her courses included painting with Neil Parsons (Blackfeet) and Fritz Scholder (Luise√±o), printmaking with Seymour Tubis, and traditional design with Josephine Wapp (Comanche). In 1969, Fife begang her university studies at the College of Santa Fe, but in 1970, she transferred to Northeastern Oklahoma State University, graduating in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in art and finishing her graduate education there in 1978. Career After completing her bachelor's degree, Fife taught for two years at the Dewey Public School. In 1975, she married Lawrence A. \\"Al\\" Wilson, who was a math instructor. The couple moved to Santa Fe that same year when, Wilson took over the design courses at the Institute of American Indian Arts, previously offered by Josephine Wapp, who had retired in 1973. She combined traditional and contemporary trends in her curricula, which included classes on \\"Decorative Techniques\\", \\"Traditional and Contemporary Fashion Design\\", \\"Traditional Techniques\\", and \\"Weaving and Basketmaking\\". Making sure that her students were grounded in the history of traditional garments, she taught them how to incorporate motifs into contemporary designs. Her weaving course used a wide variety of looms and techniques, utilizing diverse materials other than textiles, like bone, feathers, leather, and porcupine quills. She also included instruction in beadwork, teaching students how to use a bead loom. Wilson organized a fashion group, \\"Full Moon Fashions\\" to allow her students to design and market their works, and build rapport with the local community. Pupils also served as models and emceed the show. One of those, who served as emcee in 1977, was Wendy Ponca (Osage). The show was popular and became an annual event, with the students also traveling throughout the state and to neighboring states to show their work. In 1979, Wilson was offered a teaching position with the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Chilocco Indian School and returned to Oklahoma, where her three children Laura, Clint, and Dan were born. When Chilocco closed, in 1980, she began teaching art in the Morris Public Schools, where she remained until her retirement in 2009. As a student, Wilson had participated in several showings of her work, including a demonstration at the Wichita Art Museum and her selection to participate as an artist in 1969 at the Woodstock Music & Art Fair. After having also shown work in Oklahoma and Virginia, in 1972, Wilson placed first in the contemporary textile category at the Scottsdale National Indian Arts Exhibition. In 1976, she co-founded with her sisters Phyllis and Sharon, the Fife Collection, Inc., which focused on fashion design and incorporated traditional motifs and techniques from the Southeastern Woodlands peoples. These included Cherokee fingerweaving, Delaware appliqu√©, Muscogee themes and designs from pottery and artifacts, as well as Seminole patchwork designs, presented in contemporary garments, adorned with beadwork, embroidery, and ribbonwork. In 1979, the Southern Plains Indian Museum hosted a month-long exhibit of the Fife Collection‚Ä≤s works, which also included pieces from their mother, oldest sister Jimmie Carole, and youngest sister Robin. Though primarily focused on Native American fashion, the exhibit also included paintings by Jimmie Carol, embroidery works by Robin, handbags and jewelry by Wilson, and other fabric arts like quilts and wall hangings. Throughout her career, Wilson has participated in numerous art and fashion shows hosted at various venues, like the Kirkpatrick Center, and Governor's Arts Awards at the Oklahoma State Capitol, both in Oklahoma City; Broadmarket Square in Colorado Springs, Colorado; the Indian Paintbrush Gallery in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, the Coconino Center for the Arts in Flagstaff, Arizona, the Red Earth Festival, and the Santa Fe Indian Market, the \\"largest juried Native American art market in the world\\". In 2007, Wilson returned to the classroom, to study basketweaving, flute making, Muscogee hymns, pottery making and shell carving at the College of the Muscogee Nation, in Okmulgee, Oklahoma.

Twenty-first century feminist movements in Saudi Arabia include the women to drive movement and the anti male-guardianship campaign. Madawi al-Rasheed argued in 2019 that the Saudi feminist movement was \\"the most organised and articulate civil society\\" in Saudi Arabia. Nabataea In 2007, Hatoon al-Fassi, an associate professor of women's history at King Saud University, published her research into the status of women in the pre-Islamic Arabian kingdom of Nabataea as the book Women in Pre-Islamic Arabia: Nabataea. Some of the evidence she used included coins and inscriptions on tombs and monuments written in ancient Greek and Semitic. She found that women were independent legal persons able to sign contracts in their own name, in contrast to women in modern Saudi Arabia, who require male guardians to sign contracts. Al-Fassi says that ancient Greek and Roman law gave less rights to women than they had in Nabataea, that \\"an adaptation of Greek and Roman laws was inserted in Islamic law\\", and that \\"it's an ancient adaptation, that [Islamic] scholars are not aware of, and they would be really shocked.\\" Women to drive movement Up until June 2018, Saudi Arabia was unique in being the only country in the world where women were forbidden to drive motor vehicles. The women to drive movement ( qiyƒÅda al-imar æa fƒ´ as-Su ø≈´diyya) was a campaign by Saudi women for the right to drive motor vehicles on public roads, starting in 1990 when dozens of women drove in Riyadh, were arrested and had their passports confiscated. In 2007, Wajeha al-Huwaider and other women petitioned King Abdullah for women's right to drive, and a film of al-Huwaider driving on International Women's Day 2008 attracted international media attention. In 2011, the Arab Spring motivated some women, including al-Huwaider and Manal al-Sharif, to organise a more intensive driving campaign, and about seventy cases of women driving were documented from 17 June to late June. In late September, Shaima Jastania was sentenced to ten lashes for driving in Jeddah, although the sentence was later overturned. Two years later, another campaign to defy the ban targeted 26 October 2013 as the date for women to start driving. Three days before, in a \\"rare and explicit restating of the ban\\", an Interior Ministry spokesman warned that \\"women in Saudi are banned from driving and laws will be applied against violators and those who demonstrate support.\\" Interior Ministry employees warned leaders of the campaign individually not to drive on 26 October, and in the Saudi capital police road blocks were set up to check for women drivers. On 26 September 2017, King Salman issued an order to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia, with new guidelines to be created and implemented by June 2018. Women to drive campaigners were ordered not to contact media and in May 2018, several, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aisha Al-Mana, Aziza al-Yousef and Madeha al-Ajroush, were detained. The ban was officially lifted on 24 June 2018, while many of the women's rights activists were under arrest during the first phase of the 2018‚Äì2019 Saudi crackdown on feminists. Anti male-guardianship campaign The anti male-guardianship campaign by Saudi Arabia women and their male supporters opposes the requirement to obtain permission from their male guardian for activities such as getting a job, travelling internationally or getting married. Wajeha al-Huwaider deliberately tried to travel internationally without male guardianship permission in 2009 and encouraged other women to do likewise. Women activists wrote a letter to the Saudi Minister of Labor and brought media attention to the issue in 2011. A 14,000-signature petition was given to royal authorities by Aziza al-Yousef in 2016 following a Human Rights Watch report on male guardianship. During 2018‚Äì2019, a crackdown took place against the activists, many of whom had been active during the women to drive movement. Some of the women activists were tortured, with some of the torture supervised by Saud al-Qahtani, a close advisor of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. In August 2019, a royal decree was published in the Saudi official gazette Um al-Qura that would allow Saudi women over 21 to obtain passports and travel abroad without male guardian permission. The decree also gave women the rights to register a marriage, divorce or birth or obtain official family documents; and gave the mother the right to be a legal guardian of a child. Madawi al-Rasheed interpreted the weakening of the guardianship system as the \\"second victory\\" of the Saudi feminist movement, following the June 2018 lifting of the women driving ban. She referred to remaining guardianship restrictions including the need for male guardian permission to marry, leave prison or a domestic violence shelter, and to work, study or seek medical care. Al-Rasheed argued that many of the anti male-guardianship campaigners wouldn't be \\"able to celebrate\\" the new announcement, due to imprisonment, travel bans or exile. , Loujain al- Hathloul, Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sada remained under arrest, several of the other women detained in the first half of 2018 had been released while their trials continued, and a total of 14 of the March/April 2019 detainees remained imprisoned without charge. Significance of the Saudi feminist movement Madawi al-Rasheed argued in 2019 that the Saudi feminist movement was \\"the most organised and articulate civil society\\" in Saudi Arabia. She argued that the Saudi feminist movement obtained support from global feminist movements and popularised human rights concepts in general, beyond equality for women and men. She described the possibility of Saudi-feminist inspired human rights \\"language to spread beyond [the] control\\" of Saudi authorities, becoming \\"the regime's nightmare\\". She argued that the fear of this uncontrolled spread of human rights concepts was the reason for the 2018‚Äì2019 Saudi crackdown on feminists.

Early life and education Artigue was born in 1946 in Bord√®res-sur-l'√âchez, a small town in the Pyrenees. She was the daughter of a kindergarten teacher, and writes that she was \\"always interested in mathematics\\". She attended the lyc√©e in Tarbes, the nearest town large enough for that level of school, and then spent two years in a preparatory mathematics course for entrance to the grandes √©coles in Toulouse, where her sister worked as a teacher. She became a student at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1965. Her instructors included Gustave Choquet, Henri Cartan, and Laurent Schwartz. After her son was born in 1967, her mother came to live with her in Paris to help take care of him. At approximately the same time, she became interested in model theory through a book by Georg Kreisel and . She took part in a student protest in 1968, part of the May 1968 events in France, in which most of the students refused to take the oral part of the agr√©gation exam, but their resistance to the exam did not last and she completed her agr√©gation in 1969. Following this she became a student at the University of Paris, studying mathematical logic, and when it split into multiple universities in 1970 she chose to go to Paris Diderot University. She completed her doctorate there in 1972. Career While still a doctoral student, Artigue became a faculty member at what would become Paris Diderot University in 1969. In part as fallout from the student protests, in the same year, the Institute of Research in Mathematics Education (IREM) was founded at the university, with as its director, and Revuz invited Artigue to become one of its members. Through her involvement with the institute, her interests shifted from logic to mathematics education. Artigue directed IREM from 1985 to 1988. She then moved to the University Institute for Teacher Education of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, where she took a full professorship and became head of the mathematics department. She returned to Paris Diderot University and to the directorship of IREM in 1999, and retired as an emeritus professor in 2010. She also served as president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 2007 to 2010. Research Artigue's early work in mathematics education focused on derivatives and integrals and on the graphical representation of functions. Later, she became interested in educational technology and its integration into the teaching of mathematics. Her research also included work on pedagogical theory. Recognition Artigue was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians twice, in 1998 and 2006. In 2012, her collaborators organized a conference in her honor in Paris, and a festschrift from the conference, The Didactics of Mathematics: Approaches and Issues: A Homage to Mich√®le Artigue, was published in 2016. Artigue won the F√©lix Klein medal of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction in 2013. In 2015, the Inter-American Committee on Mathematics Education gave her their Luis Santal√≥ Medal. She became a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 2015.

Patterson attracted national media attention for throwing a fastball at 96 miles per hour in a carnival- style pitching game at a ballpark, video of which became popular and directly led to the signing of a minor league contract with Oakland. Early life Patterson was born in 1996 in Kansas City, Missouri. His mother is a long-time nurse and real estate agent and his father a former high school baseball coach in Overland Park, Kansas.Scott Ostler, \\"'This is real': How A's Nathan Patterson went from sales to slinging fastballs,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, vol. 155, no. 209 (Aug. 13, 2019), pp. B1, B6. He played baseball as a middle infielder on the junior varsity team at Overland Park, but suffered a fracture in the elbow of his throwing arm during his junior year and never recovered sufficiently from the injury to resume his high school career. He enrolled in a local community college before leaving to start his own landscaping business. Patterson moved to Austin, Texas, in the summer of 2015 and met his girlfriend, with whom he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in January 2018. There he worked as a salesman of computer software. Professional career In August 2018, Patterson was attending a Nashville Sounds game with his father and a friend, who convinced him to throw in a speed pitch game set up on the concourse of First Tennessee Park. Patterson recalled: > \\"I hadn‚Äôt thrown a ball in years. We're all hanging out, having a great > time. My friend and dad go, 'Hey, let's go in the speed-pitch and throw a > ball.' All right, let's go have a little fun here. > > \\"My buddy hit 65 (mph), something like that. I stepped in next, first ball > was 90, I was blown away. Honestly, I thought it was a joke, I thought they > just jacked up the gun just to make you pay another dollar to throw another > ball. I threw about five balls, and the last one I threw was 96 miles an > hour. It just blew my mind, honestly.\\" The impressive velocity inspired Patterson to resume training for a possible return to baseball. He signed with a sports agent who put him in touch with Jarrod Parker, a former pitcher for the A's, who worked with Patterson on his pitching technique. Patterson's long-shot effort was sidetracked in December 2018 when he was hit by a car and forced to undergo surgery on his left, non- throwing wrist. Having assured himself that he was on the path to full recovery, Patterson contacted the Oakland Athletics, parent major league team of the Nashville Sounds, in February 2019 and joined an amateur baseball team to hone his skill. On July 15, 2019, Patterson made a trip to Coors Field, home of the major league Colorado Rockies and lit up another fan-pitch speed booth with another 96 mph fastball. Video of his achievement came to the attention of pitching talent evaluator Rob Friedman, known as \\"the pitching ninja,\\" and a few days later Patterson was contacted by the A's with an offer for an entry-level minor league contract. Video of Patterson had previously been featured on Friedman's FlatGroundApp in January 2019.

It commemorates the French dead from the Siege of Paris in 1870‚Äì71, during the Franco-Prussian War. The sculpture group was unveiled to the west of Paris on 12 October 1883, erected on an existing plinth that had previously supported a bronza by Charles √âmile Seurre, alongside the crossroads between Courbevoie and Puteaux. The location became the La D√©fense roundabout, but the statue was later removed. The surrounding area was subsumed into Paris as the city expanded later in the 19th and in the 20th centuries; the area became known as La D√©fense after the statue. The statue was removed to a new location about 1965, and then moved several times before it was placed at its current location near the Arche de la D√©fense in 2017. Background The Republican government that came to power in France in 1879 was determined to commemorate the defence of France and Paris during the Franco-Prussian War nearly 10 years earlier, when the collapse of the Second French Empire had led to the foundation of the French Third Republic. The statue was also intended to mark the reintegration of the city of Paris into the French nation after the radical socialist insurrection of the Paris Commune in 1871. It was one of several patriotic sculptures commissioned during the first few decades of the Third French Republic, such as Rodin's Burghers of Calais and Jules Dalou's , both from the 1880s. The government of the Seine department organised a competition for a monument to be erected at the crossroads of Courbevoie, at the far end of the , on the extended alignment of the Axe historique from the Louvre, through the Tuileries to the Place de la Concorde, then along the Champs-√âlys√©es to the Arc de Triomphe, along the Avenue de la Grande-Arm√©e to the Porte Maillot, and along the Avenue de Neuilly (now the Avenue Charles-de-Gaulle) to the Pont de Neuilly . The location for the statue was the place where soldiers of the French National Guard were assembled before the Battle of Buzenval on 19 January 1871, in the last effort of the defenders to break out of the siege of Paris. Proposals were sought from around 100 French artists, including Gustave Dor√©, Auguste Bartholdi, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, Alfred Boucher, Alexandre Falgui√®re and Auguste Rodin, but the jury awarded the project to Louis-Ernest Barrias. His plaster model was shown at the Paris Salon in 1881. A casting of Rodin's rejected proposal, L'Appel aux armes (\\"The Call to Arms\\"), has been shown in the garden of the Mus√©e Rodin since 1937. This sculpture was selected in 1916 for a memorial to the Battle of Verdun: a version enlarged to four times the original size was unveiled at Verdun on 1 August 1920. Description Barrias designed a sculptural group of three figures to symbolise the defence of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War: a woman standing in the uniform of the National Guard and with a mural crown on her head, leaning on a cannon and holding a flag, symbolises the city of Paris; on the ground in front, a young soldier loading his Chassepot rifle represents the service of the military; and to the rear, a sad young woman represents the suffering of the civil population. Barrias used a similar triple composition for his Franco-Prussian war memorial sculpture in Saint-Quentin, Aisne. A plaster preparatory model, c.1880, patinated to resemble bronze, is exhibited at the Petit Palais. The statue was cast in bronze by founder . It is high and weighs . It was mounted on a tall plinth that was already in place, and which had previously supported a by Charles √âmile Seurre, which had itself been erected atop the Colonne Vend√¥me from 1833 to 1863, until moved to Puteaux as the centrepiece of the new Rond- Point de l‚ÄôEmpereur. The statue of Napoleon was removed in 1870 and lost into the River Seine (whether by the Prussians or by Parisians, accidentally or deliberately, is unclear); it was recovered from the river some months later, and has been displayed at the H√¥tel des Invalides since 1911. Reception The statue was unveiled on 12 August 1883 by Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, French Minister of the Interior, with a 21 gun salute and a military parade, observed by an audience estimated at 100,000. The statue was originally mounted on a granite plinth behind iron railings with four gas lanterns. The commune of Courbevoie became known as La D√©fense after the sculpture, and is at the heart of the Defense business district, developed from the 1950s and which also spreads into the neighbouring communes of Nanterre and Puteaux. The buildings of the (EPAD) and the Centre des nouvelles industries et technologies (CNIT) were constructed nearby from 1958, with early examples including the Nobel Tower and the Esso Tower. The statue was moved several times during the expansion of La D√©fense. The statue was moved in 1965 to a different plinth nearby, and was removed for several years during the development of the La D√©fense business district and the building of La D√©fense station of RER line A, until it was again reinstalled on 21 September 1983, almost 100 years after it was originally unveiled. It moved to a new more visible location in 2017, near the Arche de la D√©fense.

It was known as ≈íuvre suisse d'entraide ouvri√®re [OSEO] (in French) and as Schweizerisches Arbeiterhilfswerk [SAH] (Swiss Workers Relief Agency, in German) until 2011 at the Swiss level, and again afterwards for its regional branches which became independent. Solidar has more than 50 projects in 14 countries. In Switzerland, the relief organization runs awareness- raising campaigns. It has 180 employees.http://www.cinfo.ch/de/solidar-suisse The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the cantonal cooperation federations of Vaud (FEDEVACO) and Geneva (FGC) as well as many Swiss cities are among Solidar's partners. The association carries the ZEWO quality label .  History  The association was created in 1936 by the Swiss Trade Union Association and the Swiss Socialist Party, under the name of the Swiss Worker's Mutual Aid Organization (OSEO). Initially, OSEO's main line of action is to support families and children living in Switzerland in a precarious situation, notably through the funding of holiday camps or the opening of homes. Very quickly, the association engages in Spain to help the children victims of the Spanish Civil War . During the Second World War, she distributed food parcels in refugee camps in Europe, and took care of more than 2000 refugees on Swiss territory. In the immediate post-war period, the OSEO provides emergency assistance, social support and open homes for children. From 1951, the association broadens its spectrum of action. Through the creation of the International Workers Foundation section, OSEO undertakes its first development cooperation projects in Palestine and Israel or in the former Yugoslavia . In the following decades, OSEO maintained its activities in favor of the Swiss population while developing international activities. It supports refugees fleeing civil wars or dictatorships ( Algeria in 1954, Hungary in 1956, Chile and Argentina in the 1970s or Turkey in the 1980s). In parallel, it multiplies the actions of humanitarian aids following natural disasters. OSEO is gradually defining \\"priority\\" countries for development cooperation. In 2011, the International Workers Foundation becomes Solidar Switzerland. A dozen regional branches of the OSEO, however, continue to develop independently activities related to professional reintegration, training or the integration of migrant people  Locations of activity  International locations of OSEO In 2015, Solidar is active in 15 countries: Burkina Faso, Mozambique, South Africa, Kosovo, Bosnia, Serbia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, China, Nepal, Bolivia, Nicaragua and El Salvador. In Switzerland, ten independent regional Schweizerisches Arbeiterhilfswerk SAH associations (Basel, Berne, Friborg, Geneva, Schaffhausen, Ticino, Vaud, Valais, Central Switzerland, Zurich) are involved in 16 cantons with around 900 employees for disadvantaged people. They provide education, employment and work integration programs for the unemployed and displaced, and provide guidance and assistance to asylum seekers, refugees and migrants.http://www.sah-schweiz.ch/das-sah.html  National campaigns  Location of regional associations within Switzerland Since 2008, Solidar has been conducting national awareness campaigns such as \\"Responsible Public Purchasing ‚Äì No to Exploitation with Our Taxes\\", \\"For a FIFA and Socially Responsible World Cups\\", \\"Fair Toys\\", on toys that have come from China, \\"Stop food speculation\\" or \\"For pans produced in decent conditions\\".

They were originally built for the Canterbury Provincial Railways in New Zealand. They were sent from New Zealand to South Australia in 1878 and were first in service on the South Australian Railways between 1880 and 1881. History The South Australian Railways purchased their new M class locomotives from the Canterbury Provincial Railways of New Zealand in 1878. The M class locomotives were a batch of five locomotives which were also transported with the E and I classes, destined for South Australia. On journey to South Australia on the ship \\"Hyderabad\\" which was carrying the order of locomotives, got wrecked off New Zealand. All the locomotives on board were salvaged and they completed their journey to South Australia. The batch of five locomotives on the ship \\"Hyderabad\\" were to create the S.A.R.'s first series of M class. There were two different types of this class and the difference can be seen in the specifications. The two earlier built locomotives which were numbered 44 & 46 were fitted out with well tanks instead of side tanks. The other M class locomotives numbered 43, 45 and 47 had side tanks. These locomotives eventually entered service on the S.A.R. between the years 1880 and 1881 and they entered service on the Port line and its branchlines. They also time to time worked on the private operated \\"Glanville to Largs Bay railway line\\". Their duties included shunting on the wharves and later on in their life they worked on trains to Henley Beach, Outer Harbour, Semaphore and on passenger/goods trains on the Northern railway line. Note: The \\"Glanville to Largs Bay Railway Line\\" was a privately built line by the Largs Bay Railway and Investment Company and they operated hired locomotives/rolling stock from the S.A.R.

All three are venerated in Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Serbia. St. Gabriel's feast is January 15. Biography According to the Life of Saint Gabriel of Lesnovo, written during the twelfth century, he was a hermit in the tradition of Saint John of Rila. He was born in the latter part of the eleventh century in the village of Osiƒçe, near Kriva Palanka.Kiril Petkov, The Voices of Medieval Bulgaria, East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450; BRILL, 2008, ,p. 171. Today it is in North Macedonia, but at that time the area was part of the Byzantine Empire, included in a province named Bulgaria.Alexandru Madgearu, Byzantine Military Organization on the Danube, 10th-12th Centuries, BRILL, 2013, p. 63. According to other sources he was born in the early 11th century, when the area was still part of the First Bulgarian Empire.Ilija Velev (University of Skopje); The Scripture Heritage from the Lesnovo Monastery in Macedonia. Slovo: Towards a Digital Library of South Slavic Manuscripts His decision to leave the world and remain pure squares well with the great religious awakening that was reverberating throughout Christian Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Gabriel lived a life of asceticism in the eleventh century Kratovo on Mt. Osogovo, where he built a church dedicated to the Holy Archangel Michael. Several other monks joined him, and this was the advent of the Lesnovo monastery. It remains still unsolved whether Gabriel founded a monastery or whether it was founded on the spot close to his hermitage. Very little is known of this original monastery and the first and only mention of the old monastery comes only from 1330 in a chronicle by its monk Stanislav, a famous writer. During the reign of Emperor Ivan Asen II (r. 1218‚Äì1241) the relics of the saint were transferred from the monastery to the then capital of Bulgaria ‚Äî Tarnovo, and placed at the Church of St. Apostles on Trapezitsa. After the Ottoman invasion of Bulgaria at the end of the 14th century, the traces of the holy relics of Saint Gabriel were lost.SCRIPTA BULGARICA: –¥–∏–≥–∏—Ç–∞–ª–Ω–∞ –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ –∑–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–∏–Ω–∞; –ü—Ä–æ–ª–æ–∂–Ω–æ –∂–∏—Ç–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤. –ì–∞–≤—Ä–∏–ª –õ–µ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏. The church located at the present-day monastery was built by Despot Jovan Oliver, a nobleman under the Emperor Stefan Du≈°an (r. 1331‚Äì1355).

Fed by the main course of the Golmud River, it is the largest present-day lake in the Qarhan Playa. Like the other lakes of the surrounding Qaidam Basin, it is extremely saline, with 307‚Äì338 grams of salt per liter of water Name Dabusun. or Dabasun Nor is a romanization of its Mongolian name, which means simply \\"Salt Lake\\". In Mongolian, the name is sometimes designated \\"eastern\\", to distinguish it from West Dabusun Lake. It is sometimes misspelled Dabsun. or Dabsan. It was formerly known as the Dalai Dabasun,. meaning \\"Sea\\" or \\"Ocean of Salt\\". Dabuxun is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese name (D√°b√πx√πn), a transcription into characters of the Mongolian name. Geography Dabusun lies in the Dabusun subbasin in the central Qarhan Playa. It is one of the many saltwater lakes in the endorheic Qaidam Basin, bound by the Qilian Mountains to the north, the Altun to the west, and the Kunlun to the south. Lying at an elevation of above sea level, it has a mean annual temperature of despite lying on the same latitude as Greece, Algeria, and Virginia in the United States. Dabasun is the largest present lake in the Qarhan Playa. It is fed by the main course of the Golmud River from the south and, to a lesser extent, by mineral springs from the north. In Qaidam's hyperarid climate, there is generally only of annual rainfall but about of annual evaporation. Its area is thus variable by season and year, usually but increasing in the wetter winter and spring and decreasing through the summer and fall. The lake is elongated, stretching from the northwest to the southeast. Its length is usually about east to west, and its width is usually about north to south. The maximum depth is , and the average depth varies from . Geology Although the northern springs contribute much less volume, their waters carry far greater concentrations of solutes and are important to the chemical composition of the lake. Below, the alternating beds of mud and halite extend at least in some places. In addition to common salt, it also has an abundance of carnallite (potassium magnesium chloride) in an area of and magnesium sulfate. The known beds are exposed at the surface or buried by of sedimentation. History Paleoclimatologists believe that between 770,000 and 30,000 years ago Dabusun formed part of a much larger Qarhan Lake, which alternated nine times between being a fresh- and saltwater lake. Pollen studies suggest that the area of the lake bed which now underlies Dabusun was raised around in just the last 500,000 years. Tectonic activity also varied sedimentation in the lake by shifting its tributaries and basins, although it remained in the Qarhan Playa during this period. At around 30,000 years ago, this great freshwater lake spread over at least with a surface above the present levels of its successors. It was cut off and became saline again around 30,000 years ago and began precipitating salts about 25,000 years ago.. It has been shrinking in size by evaporation for most of that time, although it was only about in circumference in the mid-19th century, when it was visited by the Polono-Russian explorer Przhevalsky. Until the recent commercial exploitation of the salts and other minerals, the district has remained largely unpopulated, as the salt deposits made it difficult for the nomads of northwestern China to use the area for their herds. The area's potassium deposits were accidentally discovered in 1957 and exploratory wells found the Yanhu Gas Field north of the lake the next year. Transportation The lake lies just west of the G3011 Liuge Expressway. It is also serviced by the Dabusun and Qarhan railway stations on the Qingzang Railway.

The film deals with the German occupation of Norway. The film studies professor Gunnar Iversen characterizes it as \\"an uneven and choppy film that is marred by melodramatization that undermines authentic material.\\" Dalgard and Randal wrote the manuscript while confined at the Grini detention camp and had it smuggled out before being sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Plot It is April 9, 1940 and an airplane takes flight to warn Norwegian merchant vessels that German naval forces are on their way toward Norwegian waters. The pilot signals to a Norwegian-flagged ship that responds by firing at the aircraft. The pilot is injured but manages to land on the water. He is picked up by a Norwegian boat on his way to Kristiansand. Before he dies, he informs Captain Knut Viker and First Mate Harald Bakken about the incident. Sussie Holm is waiting for Captain Viker on the dock. However, he is concerned with more important things than spending time with her, and therefore introduces her to Harald. Knut immediately goes to Kristiansand's military to inform them about the incident with the flight. At the same time, the message comes that Norway is at war with Germany. The air raid alarm goes off when German airplanes circle the city. Knut decides to fight the Germans and takes Harald with him. Germany proves to be overwhelming and they both move to Harald's hometown of Ut√∏y, where they embark on dangerous underground work. They meet Harald's former girlfriend Elsa, and she and Knut fall in love with each other. At the same time, the Nazi county governor suspects Knut and Harald and has them watched. Sussie meets the Gestapo member Vogel and does hesitate to tell him about Knut as revenge for leaving her. One night Knut and Harald are planning to put a captain on board a Norwegian warship to take the captain to England. The county governor is alerted and goes out with the Germans to arrest the captain. However, the captain has already gotten on board and he instead begins hunting for Knut and Harald. They have been given important papers to take ashore. Knut jumps ashore while Harald is arrested and interrogated by Vogel. Later, Knut is also arrested and he is also questioned and tortured. He confesses, but protects Harald as best he can. Soon, all the residents of Ut√∏y are arrested and sent to the Grini detention camp. Knut and Harald are told that they risk being sentenced to death and therefore decide to escape. Elsa and Ruth manage to dress in German uniforms to get Knut and Harald out of prison. They flee to Sweden.

Biography  He came from an artistic family. His father was the scenographer, Pierre-Luc- Charles Cic√©ri. He was also the grandson of the painter Jean-Baptiste Isabey, and his mother's brother was the painter Eug√®ne Isabey. He received his first lessons from his father and his uncle and became influenced by the Barbizon School while still young. He decided to specialize in landscapes and was one of the first artists to work in Bourron-Marlotte, where he settled in 1849.Apophtegme.com His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1851. The following year, his painting of the banks of the Loing was awarded a second-class medal. He was also a watercolorist and published albums of lithographs based on photographs; breaking with his Romantic predecessors to present scenes realistically. One of his most popular albums was derived from trips he made to the Alps and the Pyr√©n√©es: Les Pyr√©n√©es dessin√©es d'apr√®s nature et lithographi√©es and La Suisse et la Savoie, based on photographs by taken from 1859 to 1865. Later, he was one of the artists who participated in illustrating the travel writings of Baron Taylor and Charles Nodier, collected as Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France, featuring views of Brittany. A few of his works were done in North Africa, gaining him a reputation as an Orientalist. Like his father, he also did theatrical set designs and some decorative work; notably at the Ch√¢teau de Montmort.

He has written two books and has won many awards for his magazine articles on themes of justice within New Zealand. He is also an awarded travel writer. White has won New Zealand Feature Writer of the Year (Qantas / Canon / Voyager Media Awards) three times, and a Wolfson Fellowship to the University of Cambridge. He has also won the Cathay Pacific New Zealand Travel Writer of the Year title three times. Early life and education White grew up near Blenheim, and graduated with a political science and history degree from the University of Canterbury in the mid-80s. In 1996, he graduated from the Wellington Polytechnic (now Massey University) School of Journalism. Career After six years working as reporter and chief reporter for the Marlborough Express in Blenheim, he left to work as a foreign correspondent in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. In 2003 White returned to New Zealand to write full-time for North & South, a current affairs monthly magazine. He is now North & South's senior staff writer, and is based in Wellington. In an eight-page North & South article in 2015 (Long Walk to Justice) White asked if New Zealand's justice system should establish an independent commission to investigate wrongful convictions. White researched this story in the UK during his Wolfson Press Fellowship to the University of Cambridge. White covered the Ben Smart and Olivia Hope/Scott Watson case as a reporter on the Marlborough Express from 1998; he revisited the case for North & South in December 2007. In 2014 Scott Watson invited White to interview him in prison, having maintained his innocence for 18 years. The Department of Corrections sought to prevent that meeting. It took more than a year and a hearing in the High Court to overturn that decision. White described the widely reported verdict as a \\"win for journalism.\\" \\"The judge has realised that journalists have a special role in investigating cases of potential miscarriage of justice and has enforced that role. In certain circumstances, journalists do have a responsibility to investigate these cases and the best way to do that is by talking to the people who have been convicted and imprisoned.\\" White's story on the interview with Watson in Rolleston Prison was published in North & South in December 2015. In November 2016, after again taking the Corrections Department to the High Court, he covered the first meeting between Scott Watson and Olivia's father, Gerald Hope, also held in Rolleston Prison. White has also written extensively on the Lundy case. In 2015 he spent two months in Courtroom One at Wellington‚Äôs High Court, covering the retrial of Mark Lundy for North & South. It‚Äôs a case he had been following for seven years. His 18-page story: The Lundy Murders: What the Jury Didn‚Äôt Hear, in North & South‚Äôs February 2009 issue, led to international lawyers and experts joining Lundy‚Äôs team and eventually having his conviction quashed by the Privy Council in 2013. White‚Äôs story on Lundy‚Äôs trial and reconviction in May 2015 examined whether the justice system was able to cope with such a complex case ‚Äì and if the jury got it right. In 2016 White and his long time partner, Wellington journalist Nikki Macdonald, took over the editing of long-form journalism website Featured from the journalist and author Naomi Arnold.

According to tradition, the young ascetic Prohor was shown in a vision a place near the Pƒçinja River where he would be a hermit. For many years, nobody disturbed him, until one day a hunter chasing a deer came across the saint, who was in prayer. The hunter engaged the monk in conversation, which went on for hours. As he prepared to take his leave, the hunter asked for the saint's blessing, upon which St. Prohor foretold that greatness awaited him. The hunter, Romanos Diogenes, became Byzantine emperor in 1068. The emperor sought out the prophetic hermit but found his grave instead. The church of the St. Prohor Pƒçinjski Monastery was built by the generosity of the emperor, as a sign of his thanksgiving to God and the saint. There is an icon in the monastery church that shows St. Prohor's encounter with Emperor Romanos Diogenes. Also shown are wild animals approaching him without fear such as a deer. Hermits before Prohor of Pƒçenja, John of Rila, Joachim of Osogovo, Peter of Kori≈°a and those after them have exerted an influence both social and cultural on the people of the Balkan Peninsula during the Middle Ages.

They were rebuilt in 1904 which vastly improved their performance and completely changed their look from a typical American locomotive of the time to a more British locomotive. History These new N class locomotives were imported from Baldwin Locomotive Works USA, also with two O class locomotives for the South Australian Railways. The other two O class locomotives were more of a goods locomotive and the N class locomotives were made for working passenger trains along the new \\"Intercolonial Railway\\", which ran through the Adelaide Hills. These new locomotives imported from the United States were the first to be fitted with bogie tenders. When they were first issued into service in 1881 they were allocated to run passenger and mixed trains between Adelaide and Kapunda. On the 14th of March 1883 N class locomotive No. 52 was rostered to haul a train to officially open the line between Adelaide and Aldgate. Though with a great deal of difficulty it managed to haul the official train which had the State Governor on board and made it to Blackwood, where it finally broke down. N class locomotive No. 52 eventually finished the trip to Aldgate with only the Vice-Regal and Ministerial carriages later on that day. The N class locomotives continued their service through the Adelaide Hills and on some occasions worked to Strathalbyn. In 1904 both N classes were rebuilt at Islington Railway Workshops, which completely changed their appearance from the classic American design of that period to a more conventional British outline. Along with the rebuilding of these locomotives, they also got new bogie tenders built as well. After the rebuilding the primary duty of the N class was now hauling livestock trains between Adelaide and Terowie. Though now the N class locomotives were capable of the duties of the Rx class locomotives, they still worked on livestock trains. The rebuilt N class roamed their way around the S.A.R. system until they were both withdrawn in the mid 1920s.

It is located on the site of the former Anderson family farm, a , mostly-outdoor site containing the original farm buildings, artifacts from local history, as well as a heritage building from the former community of Creighton. History =Anderson Farm= The site history, which is the main topic of the museum, is primarily focused around the Anderson family, a typical Finnish pioneer family in the area. The main period the museum focuses on is the Anderson family's arrival in the area, the construction of their farm in the 1910s, through to the farm's growth and success as it became one of the largest dairy farming operations in the area. Frans Viktor Anderson and Gretta Peltonen immigrated to Canada from Finland at the beginning of the 20th century and were married in Copper Cliff in 1901. This period marked the beginning of a high point in Finnish immigration to Canada, as many Finns fled economic stagnation, political persecution, and the suppression of their national identity under the Russian Empire. Finns were directed to, and chose to settle in, areas such as Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Michigan, and Minnesota due to the similarities in geography to much of Finland, and the fact that occupations which were common in the mostly agrarian and resource-based Finnish economy, such as agricultural labour, lumbering, and mining, were in high demand in these regions of North America. Around this time, Sudbury was emerging as a significant industrial centre, and the creation of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and Algoma Eastern Railway (AER) significantly improved infrastructure and transportation in Northeastern Ontario, making them an ideal destination for settlers. A number of small company towns were being established along these railway lines, including Creighton in 1900, which was constructed along the AER line. These new populations of industrial workers and their families created a strong local food market for farmers, and the presence of the rail lines opened up the possibility of easy export of their products to urban centres like Sudbury. Many Finns began to create farms in the fertile area west of Sudbury, and formed communities such as Beaver Lake. Frans Anderson (who began to go by \\"Frank\\") initially worked at the Creighton mine. The family's fortunes would steadily improve, as they had a number of children and moved to the Crean Hill mining community in 1906, where Frank worked as a shift boss and Gretta ran a boarding house. In 1910, they moved to Creighton and began to save money to build a farm. In 1914, they constructed their farmhouse, which is the centrepiece of the museum today. At the time it was considered to be living in Waters Township, as Lively did not exist. In 1916, the main dairy barn was constructed, and by the early 1920s the farm's operations had significantly expanded. A sign of the family's increasing prosperity was the construction of a new kitchen, which was added onto the house in the mid-1920s. By the end of the 1930s, the farm's operations had largely come to an end, however, and Frank Anderson died in 1944. =Heritage activities= Conservation activities began to take place at the farm in the latter half of the 20th century, and in 1985 the site was known as the Anderson Farm Heritage Project. Around this time, the farm's iconic Beatty Brothers Limited Beatty Pumper Windmill, which features in its logo, was constructed out of parts from the farm's original three windmills, which powered its dairy operations. In 1986, Inco announced that it was closing the town of Creighton, with a deadline in 1988 for residents to vacate the town. A number of homes in the area were relocated to other towns and areas of Greater Sudbury. Around this time, the historic log-built paymaster's cabin, which had functioned as a \\"company bank\\" early in Creighton's history, was relocated to the Anderson Farm site, and is still there today, with the museum interpreting aspects of Creighton and mining history alongside Waters Township's agricultural heritage. In 1995, the Walden Art Club had a special exhibition by local artists at the Anderson Farm, with the farm itself as the artistic subject for many of the pieces. The Walden Community Action Network's Heritage Committee was established in 2006, and brought a number of proposals to the Greater Sudbury city council regarding improvements and conservation work at the site.https://www.grandsudbury.ca/content/div_councilagendas/documents/The%20Anderson%20Farm%20Museum_0130.pdf As a result, the Anderson Farm Museum Heritage Society (AFMHS) was incorporated in 2007. Status The site is currently managed by Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums, a heritage and conservation body under the City of Greater Sudbury. It is open to the public within visiting hours. It is also the location of events organized by the Anderson Farm Museum Heritage Society, which hosts three recurring events at the site: the Rock the Farm Free Concert/Farmers' Market in July and August, a Fall Fair in September, and a Christmas tree lighting in December.

It originally consisted of more than 500 trees and markers representing the D.C. men and women who died in conflict. Dedication The 16th Street Memorial Trees were a gift to the city from the D.C. department of the American Legion. Norway Maple trees were planted approximately 40 feet apart along the 2.5-mile stretch of 16th Street NW between Alaska Avenue and Varnum Street. Each tree was accompanied by a small concrete marker with a bronze plate. The markers were approximately 6-8\\" tall, with a sloping top and the name of the deceased engraved on a bronze plate. The plates bore the dead soldier's name, their branch of service and the words \\"Memorial Tree, World War, 1917-18.\\" The 507 markers were arranged in alphabetical order, starting with Edward D. Adams in the north and ending with Randolph T. Zane to the south. At least 6 of the markers are known to have been dedicated to women who perished in the war. The memorial was dedicated on Sunday, May 30, 1920 at 4:00pm. The ceremony consisted of a parade by the American Legion and other veteran organizations, with music performed by the United States Marine Band. Assistant Secretary of War Benedict Crowell and District Commissioner Louis Brownlow made brief addresses and approximately 10,000 District residents were in attendance. Early Decades and Later Neglect By 1922 the total number of trees comprising the memorial had increased to 533. In the years following the dedication and into the 1950s, the trees were decorated and the street was a gathering point for Memorial Day celebrations and remembrances. The closely planted tree canopy created an attractive passage into downtown Washington, coinciding with active development along 16th Street in the 1920s and 30s. However, it was not long before the markers and trees began to fall victim to automobile accidents, theft, unintentional damage due to utility and landscape maintenance, and general indifference. The American Legion set up slot machines in federal buildings to fund maintenance of the memorials, but a legal ruling in the 1950s banned such machines. The Legion's budget priorities fell elsewhere in subsequent decades, on projects such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the World War II Memorial, and little attention was paid to the World War I memorial trees and markers. As of 1982, only about three dozen trees remained, many of them not originals but saplings planted as replacements for lost trees. While several dozen concrete columns were still present, only one bronze marker could be located. By 2000, the remaining concrete markers were largely flush with the earth and obscured by grass, and very few bronze markers remained. Present Day As of 2010 only two bronze markers remained, those of Leo Joseph and Private John Kendall. A ceremonial resolution was introduced by Phil Mendelson and passed by the Council of the District of Columbia on May 4, 2010, recognizing the 90th Anniversary of the memorial's dedication and calling upon stakeholders to rededicate the memorial on its centennial, May 31, 2020.

She was feared not only for her looks but also for her power of turning any animal or human being into stone just by greeting them. She is known to have originated from the hinterland of Pahang, but popularly associated with many origin myth especially of geological rocks with peculiar shapes throughout the Malay world. In literature, her petrifaction power is commonly described as Sumpahan Sang Kelembai ('The curse of Sang Kelembai'). The legend Sang Kelembai was said to have once lived on the banks of the Pahang River where she fed on fruit, meat and the soft leaves at the top of bamboo plants. Before being cursed and acquiring her petrifaction power, she was described as a giantess who love playing with children. She was also in good terms with the village folks and the people used to supply her food. She began to realize her power after a cow elephant and her calf turned into stone after she greet them in the forest. On the following day, she arrived at a village where a feast was being held. She greeted a cook but the unfortunate man immediately turned into stone. She turned to other villagers to apologize but they too suffered the same fate. There was a time when she happened to pass by an old man who was cooking a big pot of broth that greeted her, but she refused to return his greeting. Because of his poor eyesight, he did not recognize her as the infamous Sang Kelembai and invited her to join the feast by saying, sila, sila ('come','come'). In her haste to get away, Sang Kelembai tripped and started her latah as she exclaimed the same sila, sila. Upon hearing the words, the old man was instantly turned to stone. Sang Kelembai was so upset at what happened to the innocent old man that she lifted the big cooking pot and threw it into the Pahang River. As she became deeply depressed by all that had been happening, Sang Kelembai became a wanderer and went into hiding. One day she reached a village she had never seen before. She slipped into the fruit orchards to find some bananas but was instantly spotted. The villagers, who had been warned about her evil power, quickly gather to discuss how they could drive her away. They decided to place a big toothless old woman in a cradle along the path of Sang Kelembai. They also arranged some tortoises around the cradle and surrounded it with short stumps of bamboo. When Sang Kelembai was making her way out of the village, she came upon the old woman lying in the cradle. She was astounded by what she thought was a huge baby, and that the tortoises were enormously fleas. She probably also thought the baby must be eating the bamboo as if they were sugarcane. She was filled with dread of a village that must be populated by giants, perhaps bigger and stronger than she was. She fearfully ran away into the jungle as far as she could and was never seen again. Origin myth of Kota Gelanggi Caves Kota Gelanggi Caves is a limestone cave complex said to be hundreds of millions of years old, located in the Jerantut District, Pahang, Malaysia. All of the caves here are mysteriously named as kota (Malay for 'fortress' or 'city'), and commonly associated with orang bunian. Among the caves are Kota Tongkat, Kota Kepayang, Kota Rehut, Kota Gelap, Kota Angin, Kota Jin and Kota Balai. The mysterious complex of caves has been the source of many colorful tales. Legend has it that the site is the remains of an ancient kingdom known as Gelang Kiu, which in the local Aslian languages means the ‚ÄúTreasure House of Jewels‚Äù, ruled by Raja Gelanggi. A local tale surrounding the kingdom is that of a war or curse that befell Gelang Kiu, which brought an end to the city. It tells the story of a beautiful princess of Raja Gelanggi who was betrothed to Raja Usul of Bera. At the same time, Raja Mambang of Lipis also wanted to marry the princess and a war ensued. Raja Usul emerged victorious after killing Raja Mambang and won the princess hand in marriage. The vengeful father of Raja Mambang summoned the Sang Kelembai for revenge, and a curse was cast and turned everything into stone, wiping the kingdom off the map.

It is situated south of Mount Chardonnay, and northwest of Hannegan Peak in the Mount Baker Wilderness, which is managed by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Fraser River and the Nooksack River. Climate Granite Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Born in England, he studied at the Manchester School of Art and then Royal College of Art. He taught at Liverpool City School of Art and in 1910 was recruited to teach at the Canterbury College School of Art in Christchurch in New Zealand. He moved there with his wife Elizabeth Wallwork and established a reputation as a respected teacher and eventually rose to become director of the college. He had a prodigious output of landscapes of Canterbury and historical works of classic and Maori legends as well as taking commissions for portraits. He died in Christchurch at the age of 73. Early life Richard Wallwork was born on 2 January 1882 at Stretford in Lancashire into a large family. His father, also named Richard Wallwork, was married to Mary and worked in leather goods. Stretford was an industrial area on the outskirts of Manchester with little in the way of luxuries. The Wallwork family were cautious with their finances, even more so when Wallwork's father died in 1897. His mother had to take up sewing for income while Wallwork himself was working as well for the benefit of the family. In 1899, he enrolled for evening classes at Manchester's Municipal School of Art where he would study art until 1906. This include periods travelling in Belgium and France on a scholarship. He was an excellent student, earning first class honours in a number of subjects and several cash awards and scholarships. He then attended the Royal College of Art on a scholarship and became a valued student teacher working with Gerald Moira. He took courses in mural and decorative painting, etching and engraving, art history, and architecture while at the college. Teaching In late 1909 he was recruited to teach at the Liverpool City School of Art and commenced work there early the following year, teaching drawing and painting. On 16 July 1910, he married Elizabeth (), a promising artist in her own right who had also attended the Municipal School of Art and then went on to the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Soon afterwards, Robert Herdman Smith, the head of the Canterbury College School of Art in Christchurch in New Zealand, made contact with a view to offering him a position as an instructor to replace Sydney Lough Thompson. Herdman Smith was familiar with Wallwork's art, having the previous year purchased his mural of Robert the Bruce from the Royal College of Art, as well as his reputation as a good teacher. Wallwork accepted the role and the couple departed for New Zealand in December 1910. Life in New Zealand Wallwork's portrait of Victoria Cross recipient Samuel Forsyth, completed in 1920 They soon settled into life in Christchurch and started travelling around the country, painting as they went. His early output was poorly received but within a few years his work was beginning to become sought after. Both the Wallworks joined the Canterbury Society of Arts and Richard would be involved with the organisation for over 40 years, including a period as its president from 1927 to 1928. His output included Canterbury landscapes, depictions of scenes of classic and Maori legends, as well as portraits. After the First World War, he was commissioned to execute portraits of New Zealand Victoria Cross recipients Richard Travis and Samuel Forsyth. He had been exempted from service during the war because of medical reasons. At the Canterbury College School of Art, Wallwork taught not just painting but also etching and established a reputation as a respected teacher. By 1920, he was head of the drawing and painting department but still had capacity to undertake commissioned work. In 1928 Wallwork was appointed as director of the School of Art following the retirement of his predecessor. Under his guidance the curriculum for a diploma in fine arts was developed and within a few years he was on the professional board. In 1932, when the Robert McDougall Art Gallery was established, he was on its advisory committee. He retired as director of the college at the end of 1945 but carried out teaching in a part-time role for a further three years. Even into his seventies, he continued to exhibit his work, most often at the Canterbury Society of Arts and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts but also elsewhere. He died in Christchurch on 14 April 1955 at the age of 73, survived by Elizabeth and a daughter. Although his output declined in his final years as he became ill with lung cancer, his studio still contained several hundred paintings at the time of his death. His wife organised a posthumous exhibition of over 100 of his works the following year.

Biography  Hotel Hollywood in August 2018 Goddard was an entertainer who moved to England to become a star but was told she was too tall (at 5'8\\") to play roles alongside male actors. Goddard called this \\"an irreversible physical disability\\" and was told to forget about being on stage and film; she moved to cabaret instead. However, the film Geordie (1955) required a tall actress to play alongside Bill Travers, who was 6'4\\"; Goddard was sent a telegram requesting her services and arrived on set the next day. As a tall actress in Hollywood, Goddard was required to play a Russian spy, Maria, in the 1956 film The Iron Petticoat. She kidnapped Bob Hope and played alongside Katharine Hepburn. Goddard landed several movie roles and is credited to have performed in at least twelve films, most famously Geordie (1955), Tim (1979) and Hostage (1983). At the age of 34, Goddard moved into the hotel industry; she took to it like \\"a duck to alcohol\\" as Doris herself put it. She ran several hotels in Sydney, including the Marlborough Hotel in Newtown. In 1977, she and her husband Charlie Bishop purchased the Hotel Hollywood, located near Central Station. Goddard said \\"What makes the Hotel Hollywood quite unique is that we haven't tried to tart it up.\\" Charlie worked behind the bar with Goddard singing at the bar with her guitar. During her later years Goddard actively protested Sydney Lockout Laws. = Recognition = As part of the city's Vivid Festival in May 2019 Goddard was inducted as Heckler's 51st iconic woman; the list included Kate Moss, Brigitte Bardot, Amy Winehouse and Queen Elizabeth II. As part of the celebrations and in recognition of Goddard's new status a montage, created by women and featuring the 51 iconic women, was projected onto the Hotel Hollywood's facade. = Death = Goddard lived upstairs in the hotel until 18 months before her death, when she moved in to a care facility; she died on 29 July 2019. She was buried on 6 August at Rookwood cemetery following a service at St Canice Church in Rushcutters Bay. In a tribute, Sydney Morning Herald journalist Jenny Noyes described Goddard as a 'diva, icon, humanitarian and activist'. Sydney‚Äôs deputy Lord Mayor, Linda Scott, called Goddard a \\"beloved icon\\" of the city and \\"always a star\\".

Gen. James F. Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps, observes the transfer of the John Philip Sousa Baton from Michael J. Colburn to Jason Fettig in 2014, symbolizing the continuity of the directorate. The John Philip Sousa Baton is a conducting baton considered the symbol of the authority of the directorate of the United States Marine Band \\"The President's Own\\". It is traditionally passed from outgoing to incoming directors of the band at change of command ceremonies; when not in use it is held at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. The baton was originally a gift given to John Philip Sousa on the occasion of his 1892 retirement. Description The John Philip Sousa Baton is an approximately wooden conducting baton capped with a silver engraving depicting the United States Marine Corps' Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem and finished in silver at the opposite end. Along the side of the bottom is engraved the words \\"John Philip Sousa‚Äîpresented by members of the U.S. Marine Band as a token of their respect and esteem. July 29, 1892\\". History In 1892, John Philip Sousa announced his retirement as director of the United States Marine Band, \\"The President's Own\\", following twelve years as the ensemble's director during which, according to historian Paul E. Bierley, he developed it into \\"the finest military band in the world\\". On July 29 of that year, Sousa directed the band in a penultimate concert at the National Theater, Vice President of the United States Levi Morton and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Charles Frederick Crisp among those dignitaries in attendance. At the conclusion of one number, cornetist William F. Smith approached Sousa and presented him with the baton. Sousa accepted the baton and used it to conduct two final pieces: \\"Approach and Retreat of the Salvation Army\\" and \\"Hail, Columbia\\". The next day, July 30, Sousa led the band in its final performance under his leadership, at the White House for President of the United States Benjamin Harrison following which he was officially discharged from service. The last piece Sousa used the baton to conduct, while leader of the Marine Band, was \\"Hail, Columbia\\". U.S. Army Band \\"Pershing's Own\\" was the last piece with which Sousa used the John Philip Sousa Baton to direct the Marine Band as its leader. Sousa died in 1932 and, in 1953, his daughters donated the baton to the U.S. Marine Band. Since that time it has been passed from director to director of the band during change of command ceremonies and is considered the symbol of the directorate. It is otherwise held at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. In popular culture The baton figures in the plot of the 2011 juvenile novel by Martha Freeman, The Case of the Rock 'n Roll Dog. According to Kirkus Reviews, the book centers on a \\"concert [that] is jeopardized when, among other items, the John Philip Sousa baton used by the Marine Corps Band goes missing.\\" See also * Sword of State of South Carolina References Category:John Philip Sousa Category:United States Marine Band ","title":"John Philip Sousa Baton"},{"id":"61429688","text":"Albert W.

In certain scenarios, women may ask their employers for more time off before the baby's due date if her pregnancy is considered at risk and if her workplace puts her health or her baby's in danger. In some instances, women can request to work up to one month before her due date with the approval of her doctor and employer. However, this means that she will have to take a total of four months off after the birth of her child.Turner, Matt. \\"Here's how much paid leave new mothers and fathers get in 11 different countries\\". Business Insider. Retrieved 2019-08-03.  Paternity leave  Fathers are also obligated to take a four-day paid leave of absence from work during the five months of maternity leave. The mother has the option to extend the father's paternal leave if she transfers one of her maternity days to him.  Parental leave  One parent or both parents have the option to take up to 11 months of leave from work during the first eight years of their child's life. Parental leave allowance is significantly less than maternity leave allowance; parental leave is only 30% of one's wages. Maternity allowance These pensions are funded by the INPS (National Institute for Social Security) which are financed by the employers and employees through the rate established by the employment sector. Workers can either be paid from INPS or through the employer who is compensated by the INPS.Addabbo, T., Cardinali, V., Giovannini, D. and Mazzucchelli, S.

Other European models for maternity leave  Denmark, Norway, and Sweden offer up to a full year of maternity leave with a rate between 80% to 100% of wage replacement. Germany encourages women to take up to three years of maternity leave. Additionally, the EU sets the standards for maternity leave under the 2010 Parental Leave directive.

In the US the alcohol is usually made by fermenting cane sugar; sometimes malted barley is used. Hard seltzer products outside of the US have been found to use either neutral spirit, or fermentation of fruit. The alcohol by volume is around 5% and the calorie-content is relatively low. 5th generation brewer Nick Shields invented the beverage style with Spiked Seltzer, in Westport, Connecticut, and brewed the first commercial batches in November, 2013. The category saw a spike in popularity around 2018‚Äì2019 in the U.S. As of 2019, in the U.S. the most popular brand is White Claw. Hard seltzer is expected to generate $2.5 billion in sales in the US by 2021. Analysts attribute the success of White Claw and the appeal of hard seltzer in general to increased demand from health-conscious consumers. The rise of hard seltzers in the beer category may also bee seen as a reflection of the broader surge in popularity of non-alcoholic flavored seltzers evidenced by the sudden and massive popularity of brands like LaCroix and Spindrift. On the back of this popularity, hard seltzer brands have launched in numerous countries outside of the U.S., including in Canada, Australia and the UK. In February 2020, White Claw launched in Canada and has a registered trademark in the UK.

He eventually decided to enter the , under the direction of Augustin Aubert. In 1840, at the age of twenty-seven, he moved to Paris and became a student of Th√©odore Gudin, the noted marine painter. His origins in Marseille led to him to prefer maritime and nautical scenes, which came naturally to him. Two of his scenes were awarded third-class medals at the Salon, the very same year he first arrived in Paris. In 1853, he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie de Marseille. In 1862, he made an extended trip to Egypt to examine the works at the Suez Canal; travelling in the entourage of Prince Napol√©on Bonaparte, Ferdinand de Lesseps and Jules Charles-Roux. He executed several paintings that provide an invaluable record of the canal and life in its vicinity. He made another trip to Egypt in 1865, this time visiting Alexandria, where he mingled with traders from Marseille. After his retirement to Saint-Laurent-du-Var, he continued to paint landscapes of Provence. In 1882, he was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor.Dossier @ the Base Leonore.

Released in 2002, it is a sequel to the PlayStation game of the same name. The gameplay is more similar to SSX, and it features characters from that series. Gameplay Sled Storm combines the ability to perform aerial tricks with arcade-style racing down a series of seven snow- and ice-covered courses. As in previous games branded under the EA Sports BIG name, performing tricks earns players points used to unlock characters and acquire speed boosts. The eight male and female characters have varying trick abilities and they each have distinct snowmobiles, or \\"sleds\\", individually rated in acceleration, top speed, handling, and stability. New sleds for each character can be earned by placing first on the majority of courses. Modes of play include Single Race on any of the unlocked courses, Multi-Player for a split-screen challenge against a friend, Time Trial, Practice, Championship, and Rival Challenge. Championship is the primary mode in which players unlock courses, characters, and up to five classes of sleds. Each course is raced against five computer opponents in a series of three laps. Players need to finish in a specific position to advance to the next track or achieve a certain point total to unlock one of the characters (only three of which are initially playable). Once a character completes the Championship, the Rival Challenge mode is revealed. Rival Challenge allows players an opportunity to win another character's sled by racing for it. If victorious in the one-on-one race, the player can add another sled type to a character's roster. If players should lose the race, they forfeit one of their character's sleds offered as collateral. To win back a lost sled, players need to complete the same objective in the Championship mode. The computer randomly selects the course to ensure an even match for each Rival Challenge. Players can toggle the number of opponents and laps for non-Championship races, and unlocked courses, sleds, and characters can all be saved to memory card. SSX characters Zoe and Psymon make appearances as playable guest characters. Reception Reception of the game was positive. Some felt it expanded on the original Sled Storm and contained enough fresh content to be a worthy expansion of the game. However, some criticized the game for its lack of innovation. The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame considered that the game offered \\"simple controls, fast action, and inventive courses with shortcuts so long they almost qualify as completely new tracks\\" and stated: \\"Sled Storm may not offer an avalanche of features or a gust of realism, but it won't leave thrill-seeking players, especially those burned by Arctic Thunder, out in the cold with its high-powered action.\\" Martin Taylor of Eurogamer was quite critical of the game and even claimed the game \\"never becomes really particularly interesting or unpredictable,\\" adding that the game gradually becomes \\"ridiculous and occasionally downright frustrating\\"; he also criticized the design of the game, saying that the environments of the tracks \\"would be more suited to a game like Toon Car\\" and that \\"the more sensible tracks have some irritating quirks.\\" He concluded the review, noting, \\"What starts off to be a fun little arcade racer turns out to be a sadly wasted opportunity in the wake of far superior alternatives.\\" Giancarlo Varanini of GameSpot cited how \\"purists will undoubtedly become frustrated with Sled Storms unrealistic AI and collision detection issues\\"; however, he later noted that, despite the problems with the game's mechanics, \\"it's still quite fun to drive through Sled Storms unique tracks, which become progressively more insane as you go through the championship mode.\\" He later claimed that \\"for the most part, Sled Storm looks a lot like SSX\\"; and concluded, \\"Sled Storm uses the SSX formula well, and anyone who enjoys a challenging arcade-style racer should have fun with the game.\\" David Smith of IGN noted in the review that \\"EA's artists still have the touch when it comes to interface design, and Sled Storm carries off its over-the-top personality pretty well.\\" He also saw the multiplayer as \\"great,\\" the graphics \\"looking very good, with environments comparable to SSX,\\" good rider animation and a solid frame rate in single-player and split-screen. Criticism towards the gameplay claimed it \\"isn't as integrated into the racing as in SSX\\", but he still felt the game was \\"great to drive.\\" He later criticized the soundtrack, claiming it \\"doesn't seem to have as complex a mix as SSX\\" but later claiming it is \\"still a slickly-produced package.\\" He ended the review saying that \\"in the end, it's still an evolution of the PlayStation game, rather than the revolution that was SSX.\\" References External links * Category:2002 video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:EA Sports games Category:EA Sports Big games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Canada ","title":"Sled Storm (2002 video game)"},{"id":"61430265","text":"Juhani Rahikainen (born 26 June 1944) is a Finnish gymnast.

After the Klaipƒóda Revolt in 1923, Bitƒónai became a part of independent Lithuania. In 1926, the village had 72 homesteads and its population reached 391 in 1941. Due to its proximity to the Rambynas hill, Bitƒónai developed as a kind of resort and boasted three restaurants. It was depopulated during the evacuation of East Prussia and the subsequent expulsion of Germans. About 80% of the village's buildings, including the former printing press of Jankus, were destroyed. The population declined from 287 in 1959 to 120 in 1989. In 1986, there were only 26 homesteads in the village. Bitƒónai is part of the Rambynas Regional Park, established in 1992. The village is home to the park's administration (established in 2001) and visitors' center (established in 2012 in a pre-World war II restaurant). Heritage Entrance to Bitƒónai cemetery In 1972, a memorial column with a bell was built near the destroyed printing press of Jankus. A memorial exposition dedicated to Jankus was unveiled in May 1981. It was housed at the primary school until the printing press was rebuilt in 1998 and the Martynas Jankus Museum officially opened in July 1999. In 2015, the museum reconstructed Jankus' granary over the authentic arched red-brick cellar. The village cemetery located between Bitƒónai and the Rambynas hill date as far back as the early 18th century. There are small mounds around the cemetery that resemble tumuli. There were some reports of archaeological finds in the area, but in 1991 it was determined that the mounds are natural sand dunes. The cemetery was neglected and vandalized during the Soviet era ‚Äì extensive damage was done during searches for the legendary treasure of Napoleon Bonaparte that was allegedly buried during the French invasion of Russia somewhere near the Rambynas hill. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990, the cemetery was reconstructed and chosen as the re-interment place for the remains of philosopher Vyd≈´nas. His remains were moved from West Germany and reburied on 19 October 1991. Martynas Jankus was reburied on 30 May 1993. Other notable reburials include composer (1999), political activist (2009), doctor and activist (2013). Memorial monuments commemorate other personalities of Lithuania Minor ‚Äì Kristijonas Donelaitis Martynas Ma≈ævydas, Ludwig Rhesa. The cemetery is developed as a pantheon of Lithuania Minor. In 1996, German writer published Paradise Road (), a memoir by Lena Grigoleit (Elena Grigolaitytƒó-Kondrataviƒçienƒó). Grigoleit and her family were displaced three times, but each time returned to Bitƒónai showcasing the turbulent history of the region. Her mother was deported to Russia during World War I; the family evacuated to Germany at the end of World War II but returned when they were overrun by the Red Army; the family was then deported by the Soviets to the Krasnoyarsk Krai in 1951 but returned in 1956.

Irish revolutionary period During the Irish revolutionary period, the Soviets were supportive of Irish efforts to establish a Republic independent of Britain and was the only state to have relations with the Irish Republic. During the 1916 Easter Rising, Vladimir Lenin spoke of it positively calling it a decisive \\"blow against the power of English imperialism\\". In 1920 Roddy Connolly, the son of the Socialist Republican James Connolly who was executed by firing squad in the aftermath of the Easter Rising visited Lenin in Russia. Lenin informed Connolly that he had read his father‚Äôs book \\"Labour and Irish History\\" and that he rates him ‚Äúhead and shoulders‚Äù above other European socialists. In 1920, a secret loan deal was reached between the proclaimed Irish Republic and the Soviet Union. Russian crown jewels were given to the Irish Republic in exchange for $20,000, the equivalent of $250,000 today. The jewels were not returned for another three decades. The same year, Patrick McCartan travelled to the Soviet Union, hoping to secure formal recognition of the proclaimed Irish Republic however the Soviets refused as they were hoping to improve Anglo-Soviet relations. 1925 and afterwards In 1925, a three man delegation containing Gerald Boland, Pa Murray (the leader) and Se√°n Russell traveled to the Soviet Union. They went in the hope of receiving financial support and weaponry. Murray had a meeting with Joseph Stalin in which they reached a mutually beneficial agreement. The IRA would spy for the Soviet Union in the neighboring United Kingdom and on the United States. In exchange for their support for the Soviet Union's strategic goals, the IRA would be paid ¬£500 monthly. The agreement was a very closely guarded secret for the Irish, and no explicit written mention of it was made except in code. Despite this agreement some in the IRA had little regard for the Soviets. Moss Twomey said \\"these people are so shifty...they are out to exploit us ...Except for our urgent need of cash, I would not be so keen on this [agreement]\\". Frank Aiken called the Soviets as ‚Äòhopeless bunglers‚Äô. In November 1926, the Soviets decreased payments to the IRA from ¬£500 monthly to only ¬£100 a month. Their cited reasonings were both the low quality of work on the IRA's part and the ongoing financial crisis in the Soviet Union. The IRA had monthly operating costs of ¬£400 a month, so this was a major financial blow to the organization. IRA man Andy Cooney went to London to meet with the Soviet intelligence officer there, but he had little success. Trying to pressure the Soviets for additional funds, IRA volunteers were eventually ordered to withhold the amount of intelligence provided to them. In May 1927, the Soviets handed over ¬£1,000, but they soon ended up severing ties with the IRA altogether. =The Troubles= The Official IRA had relations with the Soviet Union, and during The Troubles they had been supplied by the Soviets. One Irish diplomat in Moscow once wrote that Ireland provided the Soviets with \\"convenient stick with which to beat the West.\\" Assistance from the Soviet Union first occurred in late 1972 when Yuri Andropov who was then the head of the KGB (later to become President of the Soviet Union) authorized weapons shipments. On 21 August 1972, Andropov had presented a plan known as SPLASH to the Central Committee of the Community Party of the Soviet Union. It was entitled \\"Plan for the Operation of a Shipment of Weapons to the Irish Friends\\". Two machine guns, 70 automatic rifles, 10 Walther pistols and 41,600 cartridges were sent. The pistols were lubricated with West German oil and the packaging was taken from several countries around the world by KGB agents so that the weapons could not be traced back to the Soviet Union. The weapons were brought to Ireland using the ship known as the Reduktor. Official IRA members also travelled to the Soviet Union for training.
