The route is long, and connects Balmorhea State Park to State Highway 17 (SH 17) in Toyahvale in southwestern Reeves County. The route is made up of several individual drives within the park. The route was first built by the CCC in the mid-1930s, and was designated as PR 30 in 1941. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Route description Camping area at Balmorhea State Park The main roadway of PR 30 begins at the circulating drive around the parking lot in front of the concession building of the swimming pool at San Solomon Springs. The route proceeds to the north with a spur branching off to the east to the San Solomon Springs Courts before passing the park headquarters near the terminus of the road at SH 17. An extension of PR 30 begins at the entrance to the San Solomon Springs parking lot and proceeds to the east to the park campground. At the campground, the route ends as a circular drive accessing individual camping spaces and a viewing exhibit for a reconstructed desert wetland. The circular drive is bisected by another drive with bath facilities and campsites for recreational vehicles. History The main portion of PR 30 from the parking lot at the swimming pool to SH 17 including the spur to the San Solomon Springs Courts was constructed between 1935 and 1940 by Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps. An long stretch of the spur was designated as PR 30 on April 23, 1941. On May 30, 1961, the modern routing of PR 30 was designated, including the eastward extension toward the campgrounds.

Still owned by the Federal Government, the building appears on all major heritage lists: the National Trust of Victoria (Australia), the Commonwealth Heritage List, and the state of Victoria where it is noted for its fine and impressive architecture and historical significance.Heritage Victoria, retrieved 29 April 2012 The location of the post office is still used as a point of reference for the measure of distances from the centre of Melbourne.  Significance  The General Post Office is historically significant as one of the foremost public buildings in Victoria, both architecturally and as the centre of postal communications for the Colony of Victoria, being the conduit of communication with other colonies, and the United Kingdom, the birthplace of most 19th century Victorians. It retained this central postal role for much of the 20th century, adding telegraphic and telegram functions. The surrounding steps and clock tower are city landmarks and have prominently featured in meetings, protests, and Armistice Day and New Years Day celebrations. The building occupies the north-eastern corner of the Elizabeth and Bourke Street intersection. The design is a fine and elaborate example of Renaissance Revival, with its use of arcading, pedimented windows, and layers of attached and overlaid columns, piers and pilasters, employing the characteristic order of Tuscan columns in the first level, Ionic columns in the second and Corinthian columns in the third.. The use of Mansard roofs on central and end sections set slightly forward of the main walls add a French Second Empire flavour.  History  Arrival of overseas mail in 1862. The new GPO building can be seen under construction in the background. State Library Victoria Pictures Collection. Melbourne General Post Office Charles Nettleton 1868 State Library Victoria H868 H141622 A post office was first established in Melbourne on 13th April 1837, but it would not be until 1841 that a permanent post office building would be erected on the site of the present GPO. = Design competition (1858) = In 1858 a design competition was held for a new General Post Office building, with the winners announced on Friday 7 May 1858. The competition was in two parts, Crouch and Wilson won first prize for their exterior design, while A. E. Johnson won second place for exterior, and also won second place for the interior arrangement. Johnson was then employed by the Public Works Department, and eventually construction started in 1861 on what was said to be Johnson's design, rather than the Crouch and Wilson design, which proceeded slowly and at great expense. In 1861 however, Johnson himself claimed that it was an entirely new design prepared by the Public Works Department. = Initial construction (1860-1867) = The 1861 design consisted of two storeys, taking up the full site, with a main floor fronted by arcades raised up on a stepped plinth (possibly due to the frequent flooding of Elizabeth Street), mansard roofed end and central pavilions, and a corner clocktower. Construction of this design ceased in 1867, without the northern half of the Elizabeth Street wing, the central mansarded portion or the mansarded roof to the tower. The grand hall, lit by a skylit roof, was designed as the mail sorting room; the public transacted all business outside, at window-counters opening into the arcade, with various counters designated for different purposes. = Additions (1887) = After 20 years, with the rapid growth of Victoria, the General Post Office became overcrowded, and A. E. Johnson designed a third level, an attic level, and a taller and more ornate clock tower (rather than extending the building to the Little Bourke Street as originally intended). This work was supervised by Peter Kerr of the Public Works Department and was completed in 1887. The Mansard roof originally intended for the central section of the Elizabeth Street facade was also constructed, as well as similar curved roofs as part of the tower, which, along with the increased height, gave the building much of its Second French Empire grandeur. = 20th century = In 1906-7 the GPO was extended to the north by five bays, but only two storeys (and a basement), with the Elizabeth Street facade extending the original design. In 1913, it was decided to remodel the building, turning the sorting hall into a public 'postal hall', with entrances from Bourke and Elizabeth Streets. Architect Walter Burley Griffin was hired to design the works, his design later modified by architect John Smith Murdoch of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, finally completed in 1919. The hall of 'the GPO' served as one of Melbourne's major grand 19th century public spaces for the rest of the 20th century, and the steps as a meeting place. For a period, there was a tradition of celebrating the New Year on the steps of the GPO as the clock struck midnight. = Closure and redevelopment = In the 1990s, Australia Post began a program of closing and selling or leasing out many of the large and historic post office buildings across Australia, moving post office functions into smaller shopfronts. In 1993, the closure of the Melbourne GPO was first announced and various commercial schemes proposed amid some controversy, but none proceeded until 2001, when it was leased to developers for conversion into a shopping centre, with contemporary extensions to the still incomplete north end. Shortly after postal functions were moved into a smaller building on Little Bourke Street a fire severely damaged the interior of the building, especially the postal hall, on 10 September 2001. The redevelopment proceeded as planned, including the restoration of the postal hall, and a contemporary styled extension, reopening in late 2004 as a high-end fashion retail precinct. . The redevelopment opened up a new link through the building to Little Bourke Street, and escalators in the new addition made the first and second floors easily accessible, and open to the public for the first time, with the old offices occupied by boutiques. Cafes occupied the delivery laneway on the east side, and part of the outer colonnade, while the hall itself was subdivided with glass walls into retail tenancies. This work was designed by Williams Boag architects, and won two Architect's Institute awards in 2005. A lift was added into the postal hall in 2010, but the development was not a commercial success. H&M; became the GPO's major tenant in 2014 The GPO was redeveloped again, reopening on 5 April 2014 occupied almost entirely by Australia's first branch of Swedish retail giant H&M;, with crowds forming hours in advance. The cafes in the former delivery lane and the arcades remained in place, and the top (second) floor is occupied by offices.

Early Life Margaretta was born to Captain William Elisha Smith and his wife, Louisa Barclay at Hythe, Kent. Establishing the 'Fur, Fin and Feather Folk' Margaretta was inspired by Eliza Brightwen's Wild Nature Won by Kindness (1890) on the killing of egrets for the plume trade. At church she would note women wearing plumes and send them a note on how birds were killed for them. She founded the Fur, Fin and Feather Folk in 1889 Croydon with Mrs Eliza Phillips (1823‚Äì1916), Miss Catherine Hall (1838-1924) and Miss Hannah Poland who had been close neighbours. The organisation had a subscription of two pence and in the first year their membership was nearly 5000. The Fur, Fin and Feather Folk society merged in 1891 with the Society for the Protection of Birds also founded in 1889 by Emily Williamson at Didsbury. She was listed as a Local Secretary, Miss M.L. Smith of 46 Lee Terrace, Blackheath, in the first SPB Annual Report in 1891. Work at the RSPB In 1904 the Society for the Protection of Birds was incorporated by royal charter to become the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds or RSPB. The constitution for the new merged society was written by a barrister Frank Edward Lemon (c.1859‚Äì1935) who served as a legal advisor. Margaretta married Lemon on 25 May 1892 and they lived in Redhill in Surrey. Mrs Lemon conducted the society's daily business as the honorary secretary of the Publishers and Watchers Committees from 1893 to 1904. Her position was taken up by Frank Lemon after 1904. She continued to be the driving force behind the society and her efforts are credited for the success of the society.International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950, Catharine M. C. Haines p 174 She worked to help the passing of the Importation of Plumage (Prohibition) Act 1921. The bill was introduced in 1908 but not passed until 1921 and then not enforced until 1 April 1922, a culmination of the RSPB's original raison d'√™tre. Mrs Lemon, like many other women of the time, opposed the suffragists because they used plumed hats as part of their identity. She even headed the East Surrey branch of the Anti-Suffrage League. Mrs Lemon was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union but she did not consider herself an ornithologist and looked upon ornithologists as opponents of the RSPB which sought to curb the collection of eggs and the shooting of birds for specimens. When the secretary of the society, Linda Gardiner, retired in 1935, there was a proposal to replace the position with a man, apparently to give the society more acceptability. This idea was opposed by the two women assistant secretaries which included her niece Phyllis Barclay- Smith. Mrs Lemon, who was acting honorary secretary after Frank's death in April 1935 did not support the women assistants plea for gender equality leading to their resignation. She even omitted any mention of their resignation in the society's magazine. Mrs Lemon came under scrutiny in The Field where an editorial in 1936 questioned the Society's inaction on cage birds, its gambling on real estate, the high expenditure, and aged management. This led to the establishment of a six-member committee headed by Julian Huxley of the Zoological Society of London that proposed changes in the management which included fixed terms for elected members. The rules however came into effect only in 1960, well after Mrs Lemon's death at Annandale, Redhill. She was buried at Reigate. Other works Margaretta also worked with the Royal Earlswood Institution, the Crescent House Convalescent Home, Brighton and during the First World War she volunteered at the Redhill Clinic for which she was made MBE in 1920.

The program is in partnership with Fresno Pacific University and hosts local teens for a 3 1/2-week summer workshop exploring Shakespearean style and devising original material based on a Shakespeare play. History In 2005, The Woodward Shakespeare festival staged its first season. The theater company was originally conceived by S. Eric Day and Brandon Weis. Christien Sweeney also joined the company and, with Day, helmed the first two seasons. In 2007, the company became an official non-profit organization in the public trust.

In 2007, he declared their production of The Taming of the Shrew to be \\"Audacious and bold\\" and added, \\"it doesn't outlive its welcome. It's daring, fun and perfect for an outdoor summer breeze.\\" In 2011, Munro allotted praise for the company's production of All My Sons which was the company's first foray into Non-Shakespearean territory. After viewing a performance, Munro wrote in his review \\"There's no doubt \\"All My Sons\\" still has the power to move audiences. As I left my seat at the conclusion, I walked by three semi-stunned young men still grappling with the intensity of what they had just seen.\\" References Category:Shakespeare festivals Category:Culture of Fresno, California Category:Tourist attractions in Fresno, California Category:Festivals in California Category:Theatre in California ","title":"Woodward Shakespeare Festival"},{"id":"35514774","text":"Stictoleptura trisignata is a species of longhorn beetle in the Lepturinae subfamily.

The site opened as a caf√© in 1936; the motel has remained in continuous operation since 1938. The motel rooms were fully restored in 2010, adding modern amenities such as HDTV and wireless Internet. A filling station which once also occupied the original 1936 property is no longer in active use; the original Wagon Wheel Caf√© restaurant is now a retail store filled with jewelry, purses, d√©cor, Route 66 books, T-shirts and a few original Wagon Wheel antiques. The property has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2003.  History  One of the oldest motels on US Route 66, the Wagon Wheel Cabins consisted in 1938 of three stone lodging buildings. Set back 200 feet from the road, these originally provided a few rooms each plus an office and garages for motorcar storage at a time when cabins or cottages in most tourist courts were simple single-room structures. The restaurant, filling station and signage were located at roadside. The original buildings were constructed using local Ozark sandstone and designed in the Tudor Revival style by stonemason and builder Leo Friesenhan. Original owners Margaret and Robert Martin ran the motel until 1946, by which time the accommodations had been expanded, converting garages to motel units and bringing the site up to fourteen rooms. The filling station was leased to Marathon Oil Company from 1936 to 1941 and operated by Joe and Clara Slowensky. John and Winifred Mathis purchased the lodgings in 1947, adding two new buildings at the rear of the property (one of which would add additional rooms for travelers), installing neon signage (which remains in use today) and changing the name to Wagon Wheel Motel. They became early members of The Best Western Motels referral chain at a time when the network operated as a loose coalition of independent, locally owned and operated motels. The Wagon Wheel Caf√© was acquired by Bill and Sadie Mae Pratt, operating independently of the motel and obtaining favorable reviews from the Duncan Hines travel guide. This popular eatery moved to a larger building east of the town as the Wagon Wheel Restaurant in 1954 and was sold in December 1956. Pauline Roberts later operated a small complementary coffee and doughnut shop from a circa-1950 frame storage building at the back of the motel; it closed when her first husband, Wayne Roberts, died in 1980. This mixed-use building later housed the motel's laundry; it is now a pavilion for social gatherings and a dry place to park motorcycles. shows the former coffee shop as pavilion near 0:04:22. U.S. Highway 66 (East Washington Street) was the main road in the area from 1926 until Interstate 44 bypassed Cuba in 1969. Under longtime owner Pauline Armstrong, who (as Pauline Roberts) had purchased the properties in 1963 and operated the motel until her demise forty years later, lists a caf√© as operating until 1980, with only the motel open continuously beyond that date. the 5.34-acre \\"Wagon Wheel Motel Historic District\\" was added to the US National Register of Historic Places. The designation includes the original 1936 stone caf√© and gas station buildings (the original caf√© building at that time was a souvenir shop), all three original stone motel buildings, plus one concrete block motel building and the frame mixed-use building added circa-1950. The listing also included two historic signs (the neon \\"Wagon Wheel Motel\\" and \\"office\\" signage) and a concrete gas pump island. A similarly named \\"Wheel Well Motel\\" appeared in the animated 2006 film Cars, a movie based heavily on US Route 66 people and places. Restoration Former gas station and office While the motel continued operating after the demise of Pauline Armstrong (2003) and her widower Harold (2008), the property slowly began to decline. Connie Echols purchased the site from Harold's son James Armstrong in September 2009, operating the caf√© building as a gift shop while painstakingly restoring each of the individual motel rooms with new plumbing, wiring, bedding and modern amenities in 2009 and 2010. A recent, temporary frame structure which obscured much of the original fuel station building was removed in November 2009 as part of the effort to return the site to its original architectural appearance. A $12733 federal matching grant in 2012 was used to replace the roof on one building. In 2010, Henry Cole brought a documentary crew from London, England, to record \\"The World's Greatest Motorcycle Rides\\" for the Travel Channel; the series devoted two episodes to a tour of the various U.S. states along historic Route 66. The Wagon Wheel was host for one day of Spyderfest, an annual April gathering for Spyder Ryders which was held in Cuba from 2010 to 2012, and remains one of the main stops for many Route 66 tour groups and car clubs. During Spyderfest, the Wagon Wheel hosted a Spyder Welcome Home Party with food, music, a bonfire and Spyder games. The Wagon Wheel Motel, as the oldest continuously operating motel on US 66, celebrated its 75th anniversary on August 20‚Äì21, 2011, with a Bonnie and Clyde-themed celebration complete with historic cars and garb of the era.

There is one ace of hearts in a standard deck of 52 cards. In games In the 17th century French game Le Jeu de la Guerre, the ace of hearts represented the cavalry. In the game Bankafalet, the second best card in the deck is the ace of hearts. In the Irish game Five Cards, the ace of hearts is the second highest card in the pack, below the five fingers (aka five of trumps). In literature National Museum in Warsaw depicting a wedding in a peasant house are allusion to indecent final of the feast - pitcher symbolizing a woman and playing cards, a symbol of a man with ace of hearts having a clear erotic meaning and nine of club a symbolic of troubles and mental frustration. American author Zane Grey used the cartomantic meaning of playing cards in his novels. For example, in his book The Border Legion, he describes the character Joan Randle as an Ace of Hearts, after she \\"outwit[s] and outtalk[s] her would-be-seducer, outlaw Kells\\". The very same card is pinned by Kells to a tree, where he shoots at with many bullets, \\"every one of which touch[ing] the red heart and one of them...obliterat[ing] it\\", and then signs his name below. This foreshadows the climax described above. These uses of the ace of hearts by Grey utilize the many symbolic meanings of the card including intimidation, eroticism, and death. Referring to the Jesuits, the author of The true history of Pope Joan says: \\"a certain prince of ours did compare unto them a game of cardes, in which the gamesters like loadem play and bring them forth last that are of most price, to beat downe the adverse play: or like the ace of hearts at Mawe (the game which is with us called Rumstich)\\". This is said to provide the answer to the origin of the card game Mawe. In Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy, the murder of the main villain is given away by a spot on the ceiling that \\"speedily grew as large as the palm of [Mrs. Brooks'] hand\\" and \\"[Mrs. Brooks] could perceive that it was red\\".

The structural engineer was Luis S√°enz Duplace, of the firm S√°enz, Cancio & Mart√≠n, and professor of engineering at the University of Havana. The civil engineers were Bartolome Bestard and Manuel Padron. Gustavo Becquer and Fernando H.Meneses were the mechanical and electrical engineers respectively.  History  Aerial view he FOCSA Building seen from the west showing the floating service and tenant corridors, circa 1958 The building is located on a site bordered by Calles 17 and M and Calles 19 and N in the Vedado. In 1952 the CMQ Radio and TV Network located at Calle Rampa and M in el Vedado planned to provide administrative offices, a radio station and housing for employees. CMQ selected a 110,000 sq. ft. plot of land costing approximately 700,000 pesos. The company Fomento de Hipotecas Aseguradas (FHA) financed 80% of the cost of the residences and 60% of the commercial shops. El Banco Continental Cubano granted a credit of 6 million pesos. Work began in February 1954 and finished in June 1956. At the time of construction it was the second-largest residential concrete building in the world, second only to the Martinelli Building in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It surpassed the L√≥pez Serrano Building in height which had been Cuba's tallest building. In the early 1960s, middle-class owners of residential floor units had their properties nationalized by the current government. In the 1970s the building housed Soviet and Eastern bloc specialists and advisors and the ground store supermarket was for non-Cubans only. In 2000 an elevator cable snapped killing one person. In the 2000s the building was repainted and renovated and much of the building was given over to temporary housing of foreign guest workers, primarily from Venezuela.  Distribution  The FOCSA has 39 floors 4 of which are dedicated to commercial use, two floors are for parking. Twenty-eight floors have thirteen residences each. The thirty-fourth floor has six penthouses on a plinth made possible by the structural walls which stop below this floor. Each penthouse is the size of two apartments (A+B, C+D, E+F, etc.). The penthouses have a dedicated elevator and patio- courtyards open to the sky. All apartment floors are terrazzo on cinders. The site may be divided into three parts: #A shallow, mixed-use ‚Äúwall and slab‚Äù Y of 35 floors above a base. #The podium of outdoor amenities including two swimming pools and a club for guests and tenants. The podium covers the entire site. #Four floors of building services, commercial spaces, and parking for 500 cars located below the podium.  Construction  FOCSA Building Typical Floor Plan. The building rises to a height of 402' above its footings; 11\\" bearing walls separate the apartments and in turn support the 6-3/4\\" reinforced concrete slabs at each level. The bearing walls are solid and have no openings except at the basement and lobby floors to facilitate access between rooms. There is an additional concrete mass at the center of the Y, (apartments F and G), to increase resistance to lateral forces. The walls extend through the rear wall to support the corridors. The wall and slab structural system form a three-dimensional lattice resisting horizontal forces. A high strength concrete mix from 3,000 to 7,000 psi. was used. The tower and corridors show prefabricated panels on the exterior. Reinforced concrete columns support the podium and the stories below. The residential block, the 'Y,' is supported by thirteen eleven-inch walls. The building was chosen in February 1997 by the Uni√≥n Nacional de Arquitectos e Ingenieros de la Construcci√≥n de Cuba (UNAICC) as one of the seven wonders of Cuban civil engineering.The Majestic FOCSA Building, August 2, 2011 =1/2 level= Apartments are a one-half level up or down from the service and tenant corridors. A typical floor contains 13 apartments, five have two bedrooms and a maid's room. The cost of the apartments was $21,500 for the larger units in the center and $17,500 for the smaller ones. It was stipulated that an additional $30 per each floor was charged the higher up in the building the unit was located, the highest apartments were the first to be sold.Juan de las Cuevas Toraya, published in 2001.arquitecturacuba.blogspot.com ‚Äì visited 2/2010 Located in the tower, are the building's four tenant and two service elevators and two sets of stairs. One of the service elevators is dedicated to the restaurant and the observation floor. The other service elevator is for the apartments and is linked to the service corridors. The tower also contains offices on the 37th floor for the restaurant, ‚ÄúLa Torre,‚Äù on the 38th floor and an observation room on the 39th floor. The podium contains a clubhouse, and offices and swimming pools for adults and children. It has gardens, lighted paths, and benches. There is a ramp to the street located at the corner of 19th and M, the podium was used as a staging area during the construction of the project. Below the podium at the fourth level are building offices. =Porte-cochere= Calles M and 17, FOCSA building entrance. Marked by a two-lane covered Porte-coch—êre at street level is the building's entrance. Inside is the building desk, a large waiting area, and the tenant elevator lobby. The restaurant ‚ÄúEl Emperador,‚Äù and a supermarket, a bank, a post office, theaters, and two radio stations are also located on the ground floor. (COCO and Radio Metropolitana) There are various cafes situated around the perimeter of the site and along a double-loaded corridor traversing the site from Calle M to N. Light filters to the interior corridor from openings in the podium. On the second floor are the administrative offices for the building. = Corridors = The wall of the apartments extends through the rear wall to form the support of the corridors on the exterior. The corridors are separated vertically from each other by approximately twenty inches to provide for apartment ventilation and view to the west. There are three sets of service and tenant corridors every other floor. The center corridor is for service to the building the other two corridors are for tenants. The service and tenant corridors are undifferentiated on the exterior, except that the service corridors are shorter in length, this reflects the location of the service stairs of the end units, A and L. Service and tenant corridors are located at different heights. From each apartment, the exit stair goes up to the tenant corridor and down to the service corridor. There was a private elevator in the initial design to each apartment (X on the plan), it was never installed. Ventilation The separation of the floating corridors allows for cross ventilation of the apartments and views to the west. The dropped ceiling over the bathrooms and maid's room allow for natural ventilation to flow through the apartments. Closet doors have vent grilles on their tops and bottoms to allow for air circulation. Penthouses Roof showing penthouse courtyard openings Penthouse apartments have a \\"patio\\" that is open to the sky with access to water that is located next to the kitchen.

In the spirit of reality shows such as Animal Planet's I Shouldn't Be Alive (and incorporating that show's narrator Eric Meyers), the four boys go to the Colorado Mountains to try ziplining, but their trip keeps taking unexpected turns.Kleinman, Jacob (April 19, 2012). \\"Episode 1606 'I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining' Review and Recap\\". International Business Times. Plot As Kenny, Stan, Kyle, and Eric Cartman try to decide what to do on the last day of spring break, they suddenly find themselves in a unanimous agreement over a plan to try ziplining for the first time. However, the activity proves tedious, with a lot of safety briefings, small talk and very long waiting and traveling times. The boys decide to leave after the first descent, after which they find the ziplining experience not too exciting; however, they are horrified after the tour guide tells them that there are 16 more ziplines on the tour. Things get worse when Cartman, loaded with fast food from the previous night as well as sugar and caffeine from drinking excessive amounts of Mountain Dew, constantly farts; instead of stopping, he goes on to drink \\"Double Dew\\" which has twice the caffeine and sugar of Mountain Dew. After being further delayed by a free lunch of wet sandwiches, the boys use twigs to form the word \\"HELP\\" on the ground and wait. Cartman gets a diarrhea attack and tries to find a restroom; Kyle tries to persuade him to use the forest as a restroom, but Cartman claims the diarrhea would attract beavers. Stan walks over to one of the employees to tell them that one of his friends has herpes as an excuse to leave the group, so, despite their enthusiasm with ziplining, the employee points to a nearby horse ranch, and the boys eagerly head towards it. However, it turns out that the horses are used for a tour group as well and cannot go faster than four miles per hour. While the tour group stops for lunch, Kyle lies on a rock, weak with boredom (annoyed by the fact that one of the tourists keeps saying \\"to make a long story short\\" but are actually making it long). Stan notices a marina nearby, and so they decide to get a boat to try and escape. A viewer discretion warning appears, flashing to a live action sequence. The power boat turns out to be slow as well (going five miles an hour), and the boys snap. Cartman is blamed for his diarrhea, everyone is trying to recall whose idea it was to go ziplining to begin with, except for Kenny, who does not care as he is apparently dying from a combination of boredom and herpes. Cartman defecates into the water; it attracts beavers, which the boys fight off offscreen. They then realize that falling asleep might result in their death, so in order to keep everyone awake, Kyle asks Cartman to share his drink (now \\"Diet Double Dew\\", which has half the caffeine and sugar of \\"Double Dew\\", equivalent to regular Mountain Dew), but he refuses to let Kenny touch it because he has herpes. Kenny eventually dies and the three boys end up contracting herpes from sharing it anyway. When Kyle and Cartman start arguing on whose idea it was to go ziplining again, Stan admits that he was the one who signed them up for the ziplining tour, in order to receive a free 5th generation iPod nano (which cannot be traded). Stan however revealed this earlier in the episode in one of the interview scenes that excessively occur throughout, although he was reluctant to tell his friends. Kyle and Cartman are outraged and they all have an emotional breakdown. Just as all hope seems lost, the boys are miraculously rescued by Mr. Hankey who takes them home. At this point, the live action sequence ends and reverts to its original animation format (however, the short interview scenes were still animated during the live action sequence). In the aftermath, Kenny's body is delivered to his family. Stan and Cartman are treated for their herpes (Cartman, having previously mocked Kenny for having herpes, now claims his was a cold sore), and Kyle is hospitalized due to Cartman's feces getting stuck in his nose following Cartman's incessant flatulence. Motivated to raise awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining, Stan makes a video, but ends up \\"jackin' it in San Diego\\" √† la Jason Russell again as he did in the previous episode. Cartman goes back to drinking Diet Double Dew as he refuses to \\"Dew the Math\\".  Reception  The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Marcus Gilmer of The A.V. Club said the episode had potential, but abandoning the zip-lining aspect and focusing on how bored the boys are didn't work, ultimately giving the episode a C-. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a 7.5/10 \\"Good\\" rating, also saying the episode didn't reach its full potential, but stated that the episode was entertaining.

These operations took place during the Battle of Nablus, part of the Battle of Megiddo which began on 19 September in the final months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. Fought on the right flank and subsidiary to the Battle of Nablus, the Third Transjordan attack began northwards, with the assault on Kh Fasail. The following day a section of Chaytor's Force, attacked and captured the Ottoman Empire's 53rd Division (Seventh Army) on the main eastwards line of retreat out of the Judean Hills across the Jordan River. Retreating columns of the Yildirim Army Group were attacked during the battle for the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, and several fords to the south were also captured, closing this line of retreat. Leaving detachments to hold the captured bridge and fords, Chaytor's Force began their eastwards advance by attacking and capturing the Fourth Army garrison at Shunet Nimrin on their way to capture Es Salt for a third time. With the Fourth Army's VIII Corps in retreat, Chaytor's Force continued their advance to attack and capture Amman on 25 September during the Second Battle of Amman. Several days later, to the south of Amman, the Fourth Army's II Corps which had garrisoned the southern Hejaz Railway, surrendered to Chaytor's Force at Ziza, effectively ending military operations in the area. The British Empire victories during the Third Transjordan attack resulted in the occupation of many miles of Ottoman territory and the capture of the equivalent of one Ottoman corps. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Fourth Army were forced to retreat in disarray north to Damascus, along with the remnants of the Seventh and Eighth Armies after the EEF victories during the Battle of Sharon and Battle of Nablus. Fighting extended from the Mediterranean Sea during these seven days of battle, resulting in the capture of many thousands of prisoners, and extensive territory. After several days pursuing remnant columns, Desert Mounted Corps captured Damascus on 1 October. The surviving remnants of Yildirim Army Group which escaped Damascus were pursued north during the Pursuit to Haritan when Homs was occupied and Aleppo was captured by Prince Feisal's Sherifial Army Force. Soon after, on 30 October, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, ending the Sinai and Palestine campaign. Background Following the victory at the Battle of Jerusalem at the end of 1917, and the Capture of Jericho in February 1918, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) crossed the Jordan River, establishing bridgeheads in March prior to the First Transjordan attack on Amman. These bridgeheads remained after the Second Transjordan attacks on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt when a second withdrawal back to the Jordan Valley took place from 3 to 5 May. This marked the end of major operations in the area until September 1918.Bruce 2002 p. 203 General Edmund Allenby, the commander of the EEF, decided to occupy the Jordan Valley during the summer of 1918 for a number of reasons. A retreat out of the valley would further enhance the morale of the German and Ottoman forces, and their standing among the peoples living in the region, following their two Transjordan victories. So important did Allenby consider the support of the Hedjaz Arabs to the defence of his right flank, that they were substantially subsidised: The road from the Hedjaz railway station at Amman to Shunet Nimrin remained a serious threat to the occupation of the Jordan Valley, as a large German and Ottoman force could quickly be moved along this line of communication from Amman to Shunet Nimrin, from where they could mount a major attack into the Jordan Valley.Powles 1922 pp. 222‚Äì3The Ghoraniyeh bridgehead was just from Jerusalem direct. [Maunsell 1926 p. 194] As Allenby explains, By July, Allenby was \\"very anxious to make a move in September,\\" when he aimed to capture Tulkarm, Nablus and the Jisr ed Damieh bridge across the Jordan River. He stated, \\"The possession by the Turks of the road Nablus‚ÄìJisr ed Damie‚ÄìEs Salt is of great advantage to them; and, until I get it, I can't occupy Es Salt with my troops or the Arabs.\\" He hoped the capture of this important Ottoman line of communication from Nablus along the Wadi Fara to the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh and on to Es Salt would also \\"encourage both my own new Indian troops and my Arab Allies.\\"Allenby letter to Wilson 24 July 1918 in Hughes 2004 pp. 168‚Äì9 =EEF front line= From the departure of the Australian Mounted Division in August steps were taken to make it appear the valley was still fully garrisoned.Hamilton 1996 p. 135‚Äì6Mitchell 1978 pp. 160‚Äì1 On 11 September the 10th Cavalry Brigade, which included the Scinde Horse, left the Jordan Valley.

It began in the south, where Ottoman cavalry guarded tracks to Madaba before continuing with strongly wired entrenchments. In front of these, advanced posts extended from the foothills opposite the ford across the Jordan River at Makhadet Hijla to about north of the Jericho to Es Salt road. The road had been cut at the Ghorianyeh Bridge before the First Transjordan attack, in the vicinity of Shunet Nimrin. The front line was strengthened by advanced posts which were also wired on the left flank at Qabr Said, Kh. el Kufrein and Qabr Mujahid. From their right flank in the foothills a wired line of redoubts and trenches facing south ran from north of Shunet Nimrin, across the Jordan Valley to the Jordan River, south of the Umm esh Shert ford.Hill 1978 p. 162Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 p. 1Falls 1930 Vol. 2. pp. 547‚Äì8 This line was continued west of the river by a series of individual \\"wired-in redoubts with good fields of fire,\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 548 then as a series of trenches and redoubts along the northern or left bank of the Wadi Mellaha.

The Ottoman front line was supported by entrenched positions on Red Hill beside the Jordan River, which was also the site of their main artillery observation point. =Battle of Megiddo 19 to 20 September= During the first 36 hours of the Battle of Megiddo, between 04:30 on 19 September and 17:00 on 20 September, the German and Ottoman front line had been cut by infantry of the EEF's XXI Corps. This allowed the cavalry of the Desert Mounted Corps to pass through the gap and begin their ride towards their objectives at Afulah, Nazareth, and Beisan. The two Ottoman armies were left without effective communications, and so could not organize any combined action against the continuing onslaught by the British Empire infantry in the Judean Hills. The Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies were forced to withdraw northwards along the main roads and railways from Tulkarm and Nablus, which converged to run through the Dothan Pass to Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain. There, retreating columns from these two Ottoman armies would be captured during the evening of 20 September by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, who already occupied the town.Blenkinsop 1925 p. 241Massey 1920 pp. 155‚Äì7Wavell 1968 p. 211Nazareth has been mentioned as the objective of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, who were to \\"await the retreating Turks beginning to stream back through the Dothan pass\\".

He drove via Tiberias and Samakh where he alerted the garrisons, to arrive at Deraa on the morning of 21 September, on his way to Damascus. At Deraa, Liman von Sanders received a report from the Fourth Army, which he ordered to withdraw to the Deraa to Irbid line without waiting for the troops which garrisoned the southern Hejaz.Keogh 1955 p. 251Wavell 1968 p. 223Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 511, 545It has been stated that the Fourth Army began its withdrawal towards Damascus as a consequence of the loss of Samakh on 25 September.

Jordan Valley deployments Chaytor took command of the Jordan Valley garrison on 5 September 1918. The right sector, under the command of Brigadier General Granville Ryrie, was held by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the 20th Indian Brigade. The left sector, under the command of Brigadier-General W. Meldrum, was held by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, the 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment, supported by a field artillery battery and an Indian mountain battery. The 39th Battalion Royal Fusiliers formed the sector reserve, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade was in force reserve.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 548‚Äì9Powles 1922 pp. 231, 235 While the Ottoman Fourth Army continued to hold the eastern side of the Jordan Valley, Es Salt, Amman and the Hejaz railway, Chaytor's smaller force was to continue the EEF's occupation of the Jordan Valley. As soon as possible, Chaytor's Force was to advance northwards to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, which would cut a main line of retreat for the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies. This was also a main line of communication between the two armies west of the Jordan River in the Judean Hills with the Fourth Army in the east.Blenkinsop 1925 p. 242Pugsley 2004 p. 143Bruce 2002 p. 235 The expectation was that, the attacks on the Eighth Army by the XXI and Desert Mounted Corps, and the start of the Battle of Nablus attacks on the Seventh Army, would force the Fourth Army to withdraw northwards along the Hejaz railway to conform with the withdrawals of the Seventh and Eighth Armies. Preliminary operations Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, the Australian commander of Desert Mounted Corps, instructed Chaytor to hold his ground \\"for the present,\\" but to closely watch the Ottoman forces during around-the-clock patrolling, and to immediately occupy any abandoned enemy positions.Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 pp. 0‚Äì1 (E1/71-72) From 16 September, the Ottoman front line was closely monitored, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the British West Indies Regiment's infantry battalions carried out demonstrations to the north on the western side of the Jordan River. Chaytors Force was prepared to exploit all withdrawals by the Fourth Ottoman Army, including a third Occupation of Es Salt and a Second Battle of Amman.Wavell 1968 p. 199 In addition to the close patrol work, demonstrations against Ottoman defences were made during the nights of 17 and 18 September, by the 1st Light Horse Brigade and a regiment of 2nd Light Horse Brigade, which rode out from the bridgeheads in the Jordan Valley. The Ottoman \\"heavy high-velocity gun\\" retaliated, firing shells on Jericho, and to the north of town on Chaytor's headquarters in the Wadi Nueiame.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 549 =Yildirim Army Group= Otto Liman von Sanders The Yildirim Army Group commanded by von Sanders consisted of 40,598 front line infantrymen armed with 19,819 rifles, 273 light machine guns and 696 heavy machine guns in August 1918.The only available German and Ottoman sources are Liman von Sanders' memoir and the Asia Corps' war diary. Ottoman army and corps records seem to have disappeared during their retreat. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 494‚Äì5] The high number of machine guns reflected the Ottoman Army's new tables of organization and the machine gun component of the German Asia Corps.

The Composite Division was on their left, while the Caucasus Cavalry Brigade and the Mule-Mounted Infantry Regiment held outposts extending southwards towards the Dead Sea. The II Corps was responsible for some of the Hejaz Railway, a strong detachment of about seven battalions was at Ma'an and about eight battalions were deployed between Ma'an and Amman. The Fourth Army's reserve was formed by the German 146th Regiment, the 3rd Cavalry Division and part of the 12th Regiment at Es Salt. The Fourth Army strongly garrisoned Shunet Nimrin, the entrenched area in the foothills which had repulsed an attack by Chetwode on 18 April and a second attack at the end of April during the Second Transjordan attack. The Fourth Army also held substantial forces at Amman, and guarding tunnels and viaducts along the Hejaz railway near Amman.Gullett 1919 p. 39 Battle of Nablus eastern flank 19 to 21 September alt=sketch map shows all the towns, roads and main geographic features Chaytor's Force continued to vigorously patrol the eastern flank as the Battles of Sharon and Nablus developed.

Fusail in the late morning on the western side of the Jordan River. By 19:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade had begun its advance towards Tel sh edh Dhib. Jericho was shelled again in the mid-afternoon. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Patiala Infantry, (Chaytor's Force) advanced on 20 September eastwards across the Jordan Valley toward the strongly entrenched Shunet Nimrin position, and Derbasi on the Ottoman left flank. The 6th Light Horse and 7th Light Horse Regiments, with a company of Patiala Infantry, were shelled by guns from El Haud in the foothills of Moab as they moved across the valley. Positions east of the Jordan River, including Mellaha, continued to be strongly held by Fourth Army units. Part of the Wadi Fara road between Balata and the Jisr ed Damieh bridge Aircraft reconnaissance, during a second dawn patrol on 20 September reported the whole area quiet, from Jisr ed Damieh bridge north to Beisan and from the bridge east across the Jordan Valley to Es Salt.

The regiment, supported by one section of their brigade's machine gun squadron and two guns from 29th Indian Mountain Battery, advanced along an old Roman road on the western bank of the Jordan River, with patrols pushed towards Jisr ed Damieh and Umm esh Shert. They captured Kh Fusail and Tel es edh Dhiab, along with 26 prisoners and two machine guns. Shortly afterwards the regiment discovered an Ottoman defensive line stretching from the ford at Mafid Jozele on the Jordan River to El Musetterah to the north west, defending the Jisr ed Damieh bridge. Units of the Seventh Army were seen withdrawing along the Wadi el Fara road from Nablus towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge.

Fusail, occupying a position at Talat Armah to protect Meldrum's right flank and rear, and if necessary to block the track from Mafid Jozele.Wavell 1968 p. 221 Aerial reconnaissance flights during the evening of 21 September, confirmed that Shunet Nimrin in the rear of Meldrum's Force was still strongly garrisoned, and that the roads and tracks running west from Amman were carrying normal traffic.Cutlack 1941 p. 162 Battle for Jordan River crossings 22 September =Jisr ed Damieh= Chaytor ordered Meldrum to cut the Wadi el Fara road from Nablus to Es Salt west of the Jordan River, occupy the headquarters of the Ottoman 53rd Division at El Makhruk, and capture the Jisr ed Damieh on the Wadi el Fara road over the Jordan River. Meldrum's Force left Kh Fusail at midnight on 22 September with the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment as vanguard, followed by the 1st Battalion British West Indies Regiment, which dumped their kits and blankets to move \\"at once\\" towards the bridge.Falls p. 551 The Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments advanced north along a Roman road, across a narrow plain between the Judean Hills to the west, but exposed to artillery fire on the eastern side across the Jordan River.Powles 1922 p. 246 The Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment's objective was to capture the Damieh crossing from the north east, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment's objectives were to make a frontal attack on El Makhruk, capture the headquarters of the Ottoman 53rd Division, and cut the Nablus road. The Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, with one section of machine gun squadron attached, reached the Nablus to Jisr ed Damieh road early on the morning of 22 September and captured their objectives.Powles 1922 pp. 245‚Äì6This was the second time that a commander of the Ottoman 53rd Division had been captured by the New Zealanders. The first occurred at Gaza in March 1917. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 551] [Hill 1978 p. 173] Meanwhile the Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiments, supported by the 1st Battalion, British West Indies Regiment, advanced to attack the Ottoman garrison holding Jisr ed Damieh. After a \\"hot fight\\" by the infantry and mounted riflemen, they forced the defenders to withdraw in disorder, and the bridge was captured intact.Moore 1920 pp. 148‚Äì50 =Umm esh Shert and Mafid Jozele fords= To the south of Jisr ed Damieh, the Umm esh Shert ford was captured by the 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers (Chaytor's Force). At 03:00 on 22 September they took advantage of the absence of Ottoman defenders at Mellaha, to advance to occupy trenches overlooking the ford at Umm esh Shert, which was captured shortly afterwards.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 552 The Mafid Jozel ford was captured by the 2nd Battalion British West Indies Regiment, reinforced by the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, 1st Light Horse Brigade. Despite encountering strong resistance at Mellahet umm Afein, this force attacked and \\"drove in\\" the rearguard defending the ford and an Ottoman column withdrawing across the ford. Mafid Jozele was captured by 05:50 on 23 September, along with 37 prisoners, but the bridge had been destroyed at the ford.Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 p. 4Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 551‚Äì2 The last remaining Ottoman defences on the western bank of the Jordan south of the Jisr ed Damieh bridge had thus been captured, although most of the Ottoman defenders of these two fords managed to escape. Captures included 105 prisoners, 4 machine guns, 4 automatic rifles, transport, horses and stores. =Air support on 22 September= Cutlack's Map 6 The Dead Sea section of the Hejaz Railway in 1918 No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols found the Shunet Nimrin garrison still in place on the morning of 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, half way between the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half way between the Jordan River and Amman) was found to be full of Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds. =Asia Corps withdrawal continues= Von Oppen's battalions and about 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman soldiers in the 16th and 19th Infantry Divisions were moving north towards Beisan on 22 September when they learned it had already been captured. He planned to continue his withdrawal north to Samakh during the night of 22 September, where he correctly guessed that Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army which included Asia Corps, ordered von Oppen to move eastwards across the Jordan River. Von Oppen got all the German and some of his Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and closed that line of retreat during fighting to close the Jordan River gaps. All those who had not crossed the river were captured.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 546Liman von Sanders was very critical of Jevad's intervention, which considerably weakened the Samakh position, but von Oppen would have had to break through the 4th Cavalry Division's piquet line across the Esdrealon Plain from Afulah to Beisan, to get to Samakh. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 521, 546] =Fourth Army withdrawal= While at Deraa on 21 September during his withdrawal from Nazareth to Damascus, Liman von Sanders ordered the Fourth Army to withdraw. They were to move without waiting for the II Corps/Southern Force, which had also begun to withdraw north from Ma'an and the southern Hejaz railway. The army was in general moving northwards from Amman along the railway towards Deraa by 22 September, where they were ordered to form a rearguard line from Deraa to Irbid.Downes 1938 p. 722Wavell 1968 pp. 220, 223 Aerial reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Ottoman army withdrawal from Amman towards Deraa. Ottoman units in the hills to the south west, and a column of all arms, were seen moving from the Es Salt area towards Amman. The aircraft bombed and machine gunned this column, then flew back to report at Ramleh.Cutlack 1941 p. 165 Advance to Es Salt 23 September Gullett's Map 35 shows positions on 2 May 1918 during the Second Transjordan attack, also shows the Naaur and Ain es Sir tracks to Amman Chaytor's Force issued orders at midnight for attacks on Shunet Nimrin, Kabr Mujahid and Tel er Ramr when the retreat of the Fourth Army became apparent at 23:35 on 22/23 September. These attacks were to be carried out by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the mobile sections of the 20th Indian Brigade, armed with 1,500 rifles and supported by three sections of machine guns and 40 Lewis guns. This force moved eastwards along the main road from Jericho, across the Jordan River at Ghoranyeh to Es Salt towards Shunet Nimrin, while the immobile section remained in defence in the right sector of the occupied Jordan Valley. The CRA was to support this advance by targeting Shunet Nimrin.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 552, note Before Haifa on the Mediterranean coast, was captured by the 14th Cavalry Brigade during the Battle of Sharon, Chaytor's Force had crossed the Jordan River on 23 September to climb to the Plateau of Moab and Gilead on their way to capture Es Salt that evening. (See Gullett's Map 35.) Chaytor's Force entered the hills of Moab on a front stretching from north to south of almost . The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, the northernmost, left one squadron and the 1st Battalion British West Indies Regiment to hold the Jisr ed Damieh bridge. The brigade then advanced south east along the road from the bridge across the Jordan Valley to the foothills of Moab, with patrols to the east and north, to make the climb to Es Salt. The 1st Light Horse Brigade in the centre, advanced across the Jordan River at the Umm esh Shert ford at 09:10. They met no opposition as they rode up the Arseniyet track (also known as the Wadi Abu Turra track) to arrive at Es Salt at midnight. To the south, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved round the southern flank of the Shunet Nimrin position, captured Kabr Muahid at 04:45, before climbing to Es Salt via the village of Ain es Sir. All wheeled transport vehicles moved along the Shunet Nimrin road to Es Salt.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 552‚Äì3Falls refers to four columns.

By 18:15 in the evening, the 20th Indian Brigade had reached Shunet Nimrin with a squadron of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade as advance guard. Here they found the 150-mm long-range naval gun \\"Jericho Jane\\", also known as \\"Nimrin Nellie\\", abandoned on its side in a gully beside the road.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 553Powles 1922 p. 248Gullett 1919 p.52 Patterson's Column, which had been formed at 15:00 on 22 September by the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers (Chaytor's Force) under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Patterson, concentrated at the Auja bridgehead just across the Jordan River to the north of Ghoraniyeh, ready to follow the 20th Indian Brigade to Shunet Nimrin. =Capture of Es Salt= The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade' advanced guard was opposed by a line of outposts and a strongly wired Ottoman redoubt located across the main Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt road west of Es Salt. This extensive rearguard position was attacked and outflanked by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade advanced guard consisting of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment. The Ottoman redoubt had been defended by nine officers and 150 other ranks armed with rifles and machine guns. All defenders were captured, and at 16:20 on 23 September, Es Salt was occupied by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. After establishing outpost lines and searching for prisoners and intelligence, the brigade bivouacked at Suweileh for the night, to the east of Ain Hummar on the north western road to Amman. Total captures for the day were 538 prisoners, four machine guns, two automatic rifles, two 4.2-inch howitzers, one 77-mm gun, and supplies of stores and ammunition. The brigade was reinforced by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, which reached Es Salt at 24:00, while Patterson's Column, less the 38th Royal Fusiliers, moved towards Shunet Nimrin.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 553‚Äì4 This was the third time Es Salt had been captured by the EEF in six months. The 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) had captured Es Salt on 25 March, and the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) had captured Es Salt on 30 April. =Air support on 23 September= At dawn on 23 September, aircraft \\"observed a column of fairly orderly traffic of all arms streaming down the road from Es Salt to Amman,\\" which was subsequently bombed and machine gunned. Groups of retreating Ottoman soldiers were seen moving from the hills to the south-west towards Amman. Bombing formations attacked these columns with 48 bombs and 7,000 machine gun rounds shortly after 07:00. Eight direct hits on lorries and wagons blocked the road, and the retreat became a disorderly rout.Cutlack 1941 pp. 165‚Äì6 At about the same time, airmen reported that camps at Samakh and Deraa were burning and long trains \\"with steam up [were] facing east\\" and north, but \\"would never arrive anywhere\\" because the railway lines were cut. Retreating German and Ottoman forces from Nablus were seen approaching Deraa. \\"And this was the refuge towards which the Fourth Army from Amman was making in headlong retreat!\\" =Consolidation of Chaytor's Force at Es Salt= During the night of 23/24 September, Allenby's General Headquarters (GHQ) instructed Chaytor's Force to continue harassment of the Fourth Army, cut off their retreat north from Amman, gain touch with the Arab Army, and maintain the detachment guarding the Jisr ed Damieh bridge. Horse artillery negotiating a blocked road The main road from Jericho to Es Salt, along which all wheeled transport and supplies for Chaytor's Force travelled, had been severely damaged by the retreating Fourth Army. The 20th Indian Brigade, which had been marching up this road, was ordered to provide working parties to unblock it. This was completed by 08:50 on 24 September, when the 20th Indian Brigade continued their march to Es Salt, where they took over garrison duties from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade.Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 pp. 4‚Äì5 The 2nd Light Horse Brigade continued their advance to Es Salt up the Wadi Jeria and Wadi Sir, reaching Ain es Sir at 10:30, with forward patrols to the cross roads and north east of the village. During this advance the brigade was fired on by two Ottoman 77 mm guns located near Sueifiye. These guns fired 16 shells, then withdrew as the light horse patrols approached. The brigade bivouacked for the night on the road from Ain es Sir to Ain Hummar when a strong picquet line was maintained throughout the night. (See Falls Sketch Map 24 Amman detail) Most of the land to the west of Amman was cleared of enemy forces during the afternoon of 24 September, and by that evening Chaytor's Force, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the 38th Royal Fusiliers at Shunet Nimrin and the Jisr ed Damieh detachment, was concentrated at Es Salt with mounted troops at Suweileh.Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 p. 5Cutlack 1941 p. 1662nd Light Horse Brigade War Diary AWM4-10-2-45 =Raid on Hejaz railway= Four officers and 100 men from the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment carried out a successful raid from Suweileh on the Hejaz railway line north of Amman during the night of 24/25 September. This force, carrying nothing but tools and weapons, advanced to the railway, where they destroyed part of the Hejaz railway line north of Amman near Kalaat ez Zerka station. They \\"returned next morning without the loss of a man\\" to rejoin their regiment eleven hours and later.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 554Powles 1922 pp. 249‚Äì50One source claims the raid took place during the night of 23/24 September. [Powles 1922 pp. 249‚Äì50] =Allenby's assessment of the battle= Battle of Amman 25 September Amman was an important city on the Ottoman lines of communication. All of the supplies and reinforcements for the Ottoman army force defending the line on the eastern edge of the Jordan Valley had passed through it. Now the city was on the main line of retreat.Powles 1922 p. 250 The defences at Amman had been greatly strengthened since the First Transjordan attack on Amman, with the construction of a series of redoubts that were defended by machine guns. However, the boggy ground which had limited movement during the first attack in March, was by the early autumn, firm and now favoured a rapid mounted attack.Powles 1922 p. 252\\"The memory of those four days of bitter fighting [during the First Transjordan attack on Amman] in the rain and cold were yet fresh in everyone's memory.\\" [Powles 1922 p. 250] Amman in foreground, Hill 3039 behind Orders were issued for the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades to advance at 06:00 on 25 September to capture Amman followed by the 1st Light Horse Brigade who left at 06:30. They were to strongly assault the defenders, if the town was lightly held. If Amman was found to be held in strength the assault on the town was to be deferred until infantry could reinforce the mounted infantry. Only the outlying or forward trenches were to be attacked, artillery was to fire on the town, all lines of retreat northwards were to be cut. Aerial bombing of Amman was requested. The 1st Battalion British West Indies Regiment arrived at Suweileh at 07:00 to take over garrison duties from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. Within two hours the light horse and mounted rifle brigades were in sight of Amman and the attack had begun. The movement of Ottoman units were seen behind Amman, on Hill 3039. Two batteries of small guns and a number of machine guns opened fire. Several Ottoman posts from Amman were attacked and captured by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade along with 106 prisoners and four machine guns.Kinloch 2007 p. 315 One regiment of the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent at 10:00 to reinforce the left flank of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and came under Meldrum's command. The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment advanced half an hour later, on the right of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on their left. They eventually forced the Ottoman front line defenders to retire back to the main line of defence, which was also strongly supported by machine guns.Powles 1922 p. 251 At noon the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment advanced towards \\"the main entrance to Amman,\\" but they were stopped by fire from concealed machine guns. However, by 13:30, fighting in the streets of the town was underway, when the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment continued their steady advance, and the 5th Light Horse Regiment entered the southern part of the town. At 14:30, a second regiment of 1st Light Horse Brigade was ordered to reinforce the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade's left. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment advanced to a position from which they were able to enfilade the defenders in the Citadel, and shortly afterwards the 10th Squadron, with a troop of the 8th Squadron, attacked and \\"stormed\\" the Citadel. By 15:00 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment was in Amman and, with the 5th Light Horse Regiment, were \\"hunting out snipers and capturing prisoners.\\" By 16:30 on 25 September the Anzac Mounted Division, captured Amman along with between 2,500 and 2,563 prisoners, 300 sick, ten guns (three of which were heavy), and 25 machine guns.DiMarco 2008 p. 332Kinloch 2007 p. 316 The mounted infantry method of systematically \\"galloping to points of vantage and bringing fire to bear on the flanks of such machine gun nests,\\" combined with quick outflanking of machine guns eventually won all obstacles, and the opposition was broken.Powles 1922 pp. 252, 257 During the Third Transjordan attack, Chaytor's Force suffered 139 casualties, consisting of 27 killed, 7 missing and 105 wounded. Of these the Anzac Mounted Division suffered 16 men killed and 56 wounded, while the 2nd Battalion British West Indies Regiment suffered 41 casualties.Downes 1938 pp. 723‚Äì4Kinloch 2007 p. 321 Historian Earl Wavell notes that \\"the Anzac Mounted Division here ended a very fine fighting record. It had taken a gallant part in practically every engagement since the EEF had set out from the Canal two and a half years previously.\\"Wavell 1968 p. 222 Aftermath By the evening of 25 September, the 1st Light Horse Brigade held the Amman railway station area, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade held the area to the south, while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade bivouacked on the western slope of Hill 3039. A squadron from the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment was sent to Madeba where they captured a number of prisoners and a very large amount of grain. Emergency rations were supplemented by food bought from the inhabitants.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 554‚Äì5Powles 1922 pp. 255‚Äì6 The 20th Indian Brigade along with the VIIIXX RHA Brigade and 1st Battalion British West Indies Regiment were ordered to march to Amman, leaving the 39th Royal Fusiliers at Suweileh to take over the defence of Es Salt.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 555 Allenby wrote to Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff at the War Office regarding his plans for the Anzac Mounted Division: \\"I shall leave one cavalry division in the Amman area to operate against and cut off the enemy retreating Northwards from Ma'an, and thereafter it will proceed to Damascus and rejoin Desert Mounted Corps.\\"Allenby to Wilson 25 September 1918 in Hughes 2004 p. 188 =Pursuit of Fourth Army north of Amman= Gullett's Map 43 shows Ziza and Jericho to Semakh and Deraa with positions of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Samakh, the 4th Cavalry Division, retiring Ottoman forces, the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters at Deraa and Chaytor's Force at Amman on 25 September Only a rearguard of the Fourth Army was captured at Amman. The remainder of the garrison was already retreating northwards, following orders received from Liman von Sanders on 21 September, four days before Chaytor's attack. Those who had escaped by train, before the line was cut by Chaytor's Force during the night of 24/25 September, were forced to detrain south of Deraa. Here they found the railway line cut by Arab Sherifial forces. A retreating column of 3,000 infantry and cavalry, 300 horse transport and guns, and 600 camels was seen at Mafrak, withdrawing northwards from Amman in the early morning of 25 September. Ten Australian aircraft bombed Mafrak between 06:00 and 08:00. The railway station, a long train and several dumps were destroyed, and the railway was completely blocked. A number of trains continued to arrive at Mafrak from Amman during the day, but each was attacked by aircraft. No. 1 Squadron AFC bombed the area three times, dropping four tons of bombs and firing almost 20,000 machine gun rounds. The survivors were forced to abandon their wheeled-transport, and only a few thousand managed to escape on foot or horse towards Deraa and Damascus.Cutlack 1941 pp. 166‚Äì7 The 1st Light Horse Brigade was ordered to capture the nearest water in the Wadi el Hamman north of Amman, to deny it to the retreating columns. A regiment of the brigade captured Kalaat ez Zerka railway station, north east of Amman. Here, \\"after a short action\\" on 26 September, they captured 105 prisoners and one gun.Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 p. 6 Aircraft guided the 1st Light Horse Brigade to the location of an Ottoman force on 27 September, which the aircraft then machine gunned. Subsequently the light horsemen captured 300 prisoners and two machine guns. By evening, they had captured the water at Wadi el Hamman, while one regiment occupied Kalaat ez Zerka.Powles 1922 p. 254 The next day the 1st Light Horse Regiment advanced to Qalat el Mafraq, north north east of Amman. Here they captured several trains, one Red Crescent train full of wounded, along with 10 officers and 70 other ranks found sick at Kh es Samra. Woodward claims the Red Crescent train at Qalat el Mafraq had been looted and all the sick and wounded killed.Woodward 2006 p. 202 A total of 6,000 or 7,000 retreating soldiers from the three Ottoman armies, mostly from the Fourth Army, escaped the combined encirclement by the XX Corps, the XXI Corps, the Desert Mounted Corps and Chaytor's Force, to retreat towards Damascus. =Capture of Fourth Army units south of Amman= Some of the 4,500 prisoners captured by 2nd Light Horse Brigade Chaytor's Force blocked the road and railway at Amman and prepared to intercept the Ottoman II Corps of the Fourth Army, which was retreating north from Ma'an. This large Ottoman force which had garrisoned the towns and railway stations on the southern Hejaz Railway, was reported to be south of Amman on the evening of 25 September, advancing quickly north towards Chaytor's Force.Wavell 1968 p. 221‚Äì2Moore 1920 pp.160‚Äì1 Consisting of Ottoman, Arab and Circassian soldiers,The inhabitants of the region, from Beersheba to Jericho, varied greatly in their background, religious beliefs and political outlook. The population was mainly Arab of the Sunni branch of Islam, with some Jewish colonists and Christians. At Nablus, they were almost exclusively Moslems excepting the less than 200 members of the Samaritan sect of original Jews. To the east of the Jordan Valley in the Es Salt district were Syrian and Greek Orthodox Christians, and near Amman, Circassians and Turkmans. [GB Army EEF Handbook 9/4/18 p. 61] the II Corps had three options: to pass to the east of Amman along the Darb el Haj direct to Damascus, although water would be a problem in that desert region, to attack Chaytor's Force at Amman, or to move westwards, to try to get to the Jordan Valley. Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards.Patterson's Column, which was formed at 15:00 on 22 September by the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Patterson, ceased to exist at 12:15 on 28 September.

They cut the railway line just north of Ziza Station. By 08:30 on 27 September, they had captured some Ottoman soldiers south of Leban Station, to the south of Amman. One of the prisoners said the advanced guard of a 6,000 strong retreating column had reached Kastal, south of Amman.Powles 1922 p. 253 Aircraft located the Ottoman Southern Force at 06:55 on 28 September at Ziza, about south of Amman, where three trains were in the station. A message dropped at 15:15 called on them to surrender. They were warned that all water north of Kastal was in EEF hands, and that they would be bombed the next day, if they refused to surrender.Falls 1930 Vol. pp. 555‚Äì6 No answer had been received by 08:45 on 29 September, and arrangements were made for the bombing to be carried out in the afternoon. The 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade), meanwhile had reached north of Ziza at 10:30, where an Ottoman officer delivered a letter from the commander of the II Corps. The 5th Light Horse regimental commander was informed at 11:40 by 2nd Light Horse Brigade headquarters that, unless the Ottoman force surrendered, they would be bombed at 15:00. Negotiations for a surrender began at 11:45, and the 5th Light Horse Regiment moved across the railway to within of the Ottoman force, which was surrounded by Bedouin. Reports were received by 12:45 that the Ottoman force at Ziza would surrender, and the bombing raid was cancelled. The remainder of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to \\"make a forced march\\" from Amman to Ziza, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was ordered to follow at dawn the next day. The 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) arrived at Ziza late in the afternoon.Powles 1922 pp. 254‚Äì5Kinloch 2007 p. 318 The remainder of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, less details and patrols, left Amman at 13:45. They moved slowly at first, through hilly and stony country between Amman and Leban, then trotted to Ziza, where they arrived at 17:20. The Bedouin force which surrounded the Ottoman II Corps were Beni Sakhr Bedouin Arabs. They demanded that the Ottoman force be handed over to them. This was refused, and after the arrival of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the Beni Sakhr force became openly hostile.These were not Feisal's men, but Bedouin of the Beni Sakhr tribe, who had agreed to co‚Äìoperate with the EEF during the Second Transjordan attack in April, but were out of the area when the attack occurred. [Wavell 1968 p. 222] Chaytor arrived at about 17:00, and informed the Ottoman commander that his soldiers were to \\"be prepared to defend\\" themselves for the coming night.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 556‚Äì7 The Ottoman commander Colonel Kaaimakan Ali Bey Whahaby agreed to be a hostage in exchange for the cooperation of his men with Chaytor's Force, and left for Amman with Chaytor at 17:30.Anzac Mounted Division General Staff War Diary AWM4-1-60-31 Part 2 Appendix 38 p. 7 The 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments galloped through the encircling Arabs into the Ottoman position, and placed troops in position at intervals in the Ottoman line, where they remained until the morning.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 559Kinloch 2007 pp. 318‚Äì9 Two small clashes between Beni Sakhr Arabs and Ottomans occurred before dark, but a cordon was put round the Ottoman force after the arrival of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade.

All arms and equipment were collected and put in railway trucks. This task was finished by 15:30. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment remained to guard the sick until transport was organised. One hundred sick walking cases were sent on to Amman in New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade transport wagons and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade commenced its return journey to Amman. They arrived at 21:00, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remained in charge at Ziza. Chaytor's Force's total captures from the beginning of operations to 30 September were 10,322 prisoners, 57 guns including one 5.9-inch gun, three 5.9-inch howitzers, one anti aircraft gun, ten 10 cm guns, 32 77 mm guns, six 75 mm guns, two 3-inch guns and two 13 pounder HAC guns, 147 machine guns, 13 automatic rifles including one Hotchkiss rifle and one Lewis gun, two wireless sets, 11 railway engines, 106 railway rolling stock, 142 vehicles and large quantities of artillery shells, small arms ammunition (SAA) and other material. =Medical establishments and evacuations= Roman Amphitheatre at Amman The mobile sections of the field ambulances followed their brigades to Es Salt with their camel transport. They travelled up the Umm esh Shert and Jisr ed Damieh tracks, while their wheeled transport followed by the Shunet Nimrim road. A divisional collecting station was established at Suweileh, during the Second Battle of Amman, by the immobile section of the 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance and the Anzac (No. 7) Sanitary Section. Both of these units arrived from Jerusalem early on 25 September, following the wheeled supply vehicles along the Shunet Nimrin road. Subsequently a dressing-station was opened in the ruins of the Roman amphitheatre at Amman. There, 268 sick and wounded light horsemen were admitted up to 30 September and evacuated from Amman by motor ambulance wagons. Two Ottoman hospitals in the town were found to hold 480 patients, a number which quickly grew to more than 1,000. These patients and the Ottoman medical staff were evacuated to Jerusalem by motor lorries. There were also 1,269 British and Indian sick evacuated from Amman in the ten days between 30 September and 9 October.Downes 1938 pp. 722‚Äì3 A hospital and camp in the hills of Moab, Jordan These large numbers of evacuations to Jericho, eight to ten hours away, travelled mostly in motor lorries. Motor ambulances were reserved for the most severe cases. The trip was broken about south of Es Salt, where the Welsh Field Ambulance fed the patients and rested them for two hours before they resumed their journey. One group of motor ambulances drove between Amman and the Welsh Field Ambulance, and a second group drove from the Welsh Field Ambulance to Jericho. Motor lorries and some cars of No. 35 Motor Ambulance Convoy evacuated the sick from the Anzac Mounted Division receiving station near Jericho to the casualty clearing station at Jerusalem. =Health among the troops= Downes Map 20 Desert Mounted Corps medical situation 27‚Äì28 September 1918 Many of the troops at Amman had garrisoned the malarial Jordan Valley for over six months, during the summer. The hot, humid Jordan Valley sits at about below sea level, while the troops at Amman were now some above sea level in a climate where the nights were cold. With malaria dormant in their blood, the change of climate caused many cases of attacks of malaria fever.Moore 1920 p. 151Many of Chaytor's Force became sick towards the end of operations, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade lost almost 60 per cent of its strength sick to hospital during the period. [Moore 1920 p. 151] Before the returning 2nd Light Horse and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades reached Jerusalem on their way back to Deiran, they, along with the 1st Light Horse Brigade still the Amman area, were struck by a heavy outbreak of disease. \\"Between 19 September and 3 November, 6920 men in Chaytor's Force were listed as sick. In the Anzac division, 1088 men were sick in September; the number trebled in the following month ... In some regiments, riderless horses were let loose and herded down into the valley like a mob of cattle.\\" The Anzac Mounted Division evacuated more than 3,000 sick in the last three weeks of September 2700 of which were cases of malignant malaria.Preston 1921 p. 246 The divisional collecting station was brought forward from Suweileh on 30 September, and at one time treated as many as 246 cases, the majority of which were seriously ill.Downes 1938 p. 723 The 1st Light Horse Brigade evacuated 126 cases during the seven days following 28 September, and 239 cases by 10 October. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade evacuated 316 cases and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had 57 cases, many of whom suffered a high fever of 105¬∞ to 106 ¬∞F.Blenkinsop 1925 pp. 243‚Äì4 More than 700 cases of mostly malignant malaria were reported during the first 12 days of October, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade lost about one third of its strength.Pugsley 2004 p. 144 Of the approximately 5,000 New Zealanders, about 3,000 were either in hospital or in convalescent depots, mostly with malaria. On 21 September 1 Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigades accompanied by the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment advanced to the Jisr ed Damieh. The surrounding area was swampy ground where no mosquito management had been carried out. \\"The air was full of hordes of peculiarly aggressive and blood‚Äìthirsty mosquitoes, laden with as subsequent events proved the parasites of malignant malaria.\\" While the other units advanced to Es Salt and Amman, the 2nd Battalion remained to guard the bridge and was subsequently virtually the whole unit was infected with malaria. By 19 October 726 soldiers from this unit, had been evacuated with malignant malaria. Within the units of Chaytor's Force which moved to Es Salt and Amman cases of malignant malaria began to appear in much smaller numbers on 28 September and up to 10 October 2 Light Horse Brigade which had not been in the Jisr ed Damieh area evacuated 57 soldiers compared with 239 from the 1st Light Horse Brigade and 316 from the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade.Powles 1922 pp. 261‚Äì2 Of the many hundreds sent to hospital with malaria, many died, many recovered in hospital but later suffered a relapse and went to hospital again, many men were invalided home as a result of malaria, with their health badly undermined.Moore 1920 p. 142 With so many men sick amongst the British Empire forces, it became common for one man to be placed in charge of eight horses. At this time, the horses were fed newly threshed barley, which resulted in the deaths of 15 horses in Chaytor's Force, while a further 160 became seriously ill. =Return to Richon le Zion= Leaving the Jordan Valley for the last time. Jericho in middle distance with hills of Moab in the background The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade returned from Ziza to Amman between 1 and 2 October, then continued on to Ain es Sir on 3 October and returned to the Jordan Valley the next day. At Ain es Sir, the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment captured a number of Circassians \\"suspected of involvement in the May attack and escorted them to Jerusalem for trial.\\"Kinloch 2007 p. 323Powles 1922 p. 256This incident occurred during the First Transjordan attack, on 1 April at 07:45, during the retreat from Amman. See First Transjordan attack on Amman. The brigade left the Jordan Valley after three days at Jericho, bivouacking at Tallat ed Dumm on 8 October. They paused at midday on 9 October at the Mount of Olives, near Bethany, then \\"rode down into the Valley of Jehosophat for the last time, past the Garden of Gethsemane, up round the old walls and then through the streets of Jerusalem, past the Jaffa Gate, on to the Hebron road.\\" The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade rested for a few days near Jerusalem, then returned to Richon le Zion on 14 October to rest and recuperate.Moore 1920 pp. 166‚Äì7Powles 1922 pp. 256, 263 Notes Citations References          * Further reading * Category:British Empire in World War I Category:German Empire in World War I Category:Ottoman Empire in World War I Category:Middle Eastern theatre of World War I Sinai and Palestine Category:Military campaigns and theatres of World War I involving Australia Category:Military campaigns and theatres of World War I involving New Zealand Category:Conflicts in 1918 Category:1918 in British-administered Palestine Category:1918 in Ottoman Syria Category:Battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign Category:Battles of World War I involving Australia Category:Battles of World War I involving New Zealand Category:Battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of World War I involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles of World War I involving British India Category:Battles of World War I involving British West Indies Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War I Category:History of the Royal Air Force during World War I Category:Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk Category:ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º Category:September 1918 events ","title":"Third Transjordan attack"},{"id":"35514955","text":"In the Philippines, the Kapampangan Development Foundation (KDF)Ocampo Flora (2012) is an organization of Kapampangans living outside the region.

Biography He was born in Florence into a middle-class family belonging to the local gentry. He began his artistic training in 1859 at the Florentine Academy under the sculptor Aristodemo Costoli. In that same year he fought alongside Telemaco Signorini in the Second Italian War of Independence.Steingr√§ber & Matteucci 1984, p. 108 In 1860 he participated in a competition to provide military artworks for the Tuscan government. His submission, a maquette for a statue of Charles Albert of Savoy, won a prize but was deemed unsatisfactory by academicians and was not commissioned.Oxford Art Online In 1863 Cecioni received a grant and went to Naples, where he was instrumental in the formation of the artists' group Scuola di Resina, which included Giuseppe De Nittis, Marco de Gregorio, and Federico Rossano. A major work of this period was his sculpture The Suicide, which he exhibited at the Florence Academy in 1867. In 1872 Cecioni spent six months in London, where he contributed a series of caricatures to Vanity Fair magazine. After he returned to Italy, the sculptures he produced for the rest of his career were mainly genre works, often humorous in nature. He also painted domestic scenes. In 1884 he became Professor of Drawing at the Istituto di Magistero Femminile. Cecioni's activities as an art critic, which began in the 1870s, consumed an increasing amount of his time in his later years. He died of a heart attack on May 23, 1886. His work is in collections including Galleria d'arte moderna di Palazzo Pitti, Florence; Galleria nazionale d'arte moderna, Rome; Museo statale d'arte medievale e moderna, Arezzo; and Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan.

In the course of the event, a Shiite Arab militia, accompanied by Bedouin from a nearby village, attacked the Jewish agricultural locality of Tel Hai. In the aftermath of the battle eight Jews and five Arabs were killed. Joseph Trumpeldor, the commander of Jewish defenders of Tel Hai, was shot in the hand and stomach, and died while being evacuated to Kfar Giladi that evening. Tel Hai was eventually abandoned by the Jews and burned by the Arab militia. The event is perceived by some scholars as part of the Franco-Syrian War and by some as an outbreak of violence, in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Background Tel Hai had been intermittently inhabited since 1905 and was permanently settled as a border outpost in 1918, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. The area was subsequently subject to intermittent border adjustments between the British and the French. The Franco-Syrian War took place in early 1920 between Syrian Arab nationalists, under the Hashemite King, and France. Gangs ('isabat) of clan-based border peasants, combining politics and banditry, were active in the area of the loosely defined border between the soon to be established Mandatory Palestine, French Mandate of Lebanon and Syria.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, vol.1, Fayard, Paris 1999 p.502 Joseph Trumpeldor had served as an officer in the Russian Army during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905, being one of the few Russian Jews to gain a commission under the Tsar. He had also commanded a Jewish auxiliary unit fighting together with the British Army during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. As such, he was a well experienced military man, whom the Zionist movement could send to command the threatened outpost. History At the beginning of the Franco-Syrian War, the Upper Galilee was populated by several semi-nomadic Bedouin Arab tribes, the largest residing in Halasa, and four tiny Jewish settlements, including Metula, Kfar Giladi, Tel Hai and Hamra. While the Arab villages and Bedouin allied with the Arab Kingdom of Syria, the Jewish residents chose to remain neutral during the Arab conflict with the French. Early in the war, a Kfar Giladi resident was killed by armed Bedouin, greatly increasing tension in the region. Jewish villages were regularly pillaged by the pro-Syrian Bedouin on the pretext of searching for French spies and soldiers. In one incident, Trumpeldor and other Jews were stripped of their clothes as a public insult by an Arab Bedouin militia. =Battle= On March 1, 1920, several hundred Shiite Arabs from the village of Jabal Amil in southern Lebanon marched to the gates of Tel Hai together with Bedouin from Halasa and their Mukhtar, Kamal Affendi. They demanded to search Tel Hai for French soldiers. One of the farmers fired a shot into the air, a signal for reinforcements from nearby Kfar Giladi, which brought ten men led by Trumpeldor, who had been posted by Hashomer to organize defense. Joseph Trumpeldor and his ten men attempted to influence the Shiites and roving village militias to go away through negotiation. The Arabs demanded to search Tel Hai, which some claim was a ruse, while their real intentions were intelligence-gathering, murder and driving out the Jews. Kamal Affendi was allowed to enter the village to search for French soldiers. He encountered one of the female Jewish residents named Deborah who pointed a pistol at Kamal, apparently surprised to see an armed Bedouin in the village. A shot was discharged during the struggle (unclear whether from the pistol or by another weapon) and a major firefight erupted. Trumpeldor was shot and seriously wounded, while the sides barricaded themselves in the village. Kamal Affendi asked to leave, saying it was all a misunderstanding, and the Jewish force approved the cease-fire. During the Arab retreat, one of the Jewish defenders, unaware of the agreements by his comrades and hearing-impaired by the previous firefight, shot at the Arab party, and the exchange of fire recommenced. Six Jews and five Arabs were killed in the fighting. Trumpeldor was shot in the hand and stomach and died while being evacuated to Kfar Giladi that evening. The survivors of Tel Hai found their position untenable and had no choice but to withdraw, whereupon the Arabs set fire to the village.Cohen, Aharon (1970) Israel and the Arab World. W.H. Allen. . p.178. Names the other dead as Dvor Drachler, Benjamin Toker, Benjamin Munter, Sarah Chijik and Zeev Scharf. Aftermath The eight Jews killed at Tel Hai (this number including two killed in a previous probing attack in January 1920) were buried in two common graves in Kfar Giladi, and both locations were abandoned for a time. On 3 March, Kfar Giladi was also attacked by a large group of Bedouin. The defenders abandoned the position and retreated to the Shia village of Taibe where they were given shelter and an escort to Ayelet Hashahar which was under British control.Cohen. p 178. The Franco-Syrian War entered its last stages in July 1920, with the defeat of Hashemites in the Battle of Maysalun. The border in the area of Upper Galilee was finally agreed between the British and the French, and this area was to be included in Mandatory Palestine. It was thus possible for Tel Hai to be resettled in 1921, though it did not become a viable independent community and in 1926 was absorbed into the kibbutz of Kfar Giladi. With a national monument in Upper Galilee, Israel commemorates the deaths of eight Jews, six men and two women, including Joseph Trumpeldor. The memorial is best known for an emblematic statue of a defiant lion representing Trumpeldor and his comrades. The city of Kiryat Shemona, literally Town of the Eight was named after them. The man who had led the attack, Kemal Hussein, represented the Jewish National Fund which in 1939 purchased land for Kibbutz Dafna. Significance Idith Zertal has written that it marked 'the dramatic initiation of the violent conflict over Palestine.'Idith Zertal, Israel's Holocaust And The Politics Of Nationhood, Cambridge University Press, 2005 p.5. =Trumpeldor's heritage= Trumpeldor was severely wounded and died after several hours. He is traditionally credited with having said before dying \\"No matter, it is good to die (tov lamut) for our country\\" (\\"◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ì◊ë◊®, ◊ò◊ï◊ë ◊ú◊û◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊¢◊ì ◊ê◊®◊¶◊†◊ï\\") words which in Zionist and Israeli collective memory remain closely associated with the names \\"Trumpeldor\\" and \\"Tel Hai\\". A recent theory has argued that Trumpeldor's last words were, in fact, a pungent curse in his mother-tongue Russian, reflecting frustration with his bad luck, namely 'Fuck your mother' ((Yob tvoy√∫ mat'),:—ë–± —Ç–≤–æ—é –º–∞—Ç—å! ).Yael Zerubavel, 'The Historic, the Legendary, and the Incredible: Invented Tradition and Collective Memory in Israel,' in John R. Gillis,Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity, Princeton University Press, 1994 pp. 105‚Äì126, p. 115. The words attributed to Trumpeldor, moreover, are clearly a variant of the well known saying \\"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\\" (\\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country\\"), derived from the Odes of the Roman poet Horace ‚Äì lines with which Trumpeldor, like other educated Europeans of the time, may have been familiar.

Biography Beckwith was born on June 25, 1818 (some report a January birthdate) in Cazenovia, New York, son of Judge Barak Beckwith, and Polly (Kennedy) Beckwith. He graduated from West Point in 1842. He served in garrison at Savannah, Georgia as a second lieutenant of the Third Artillery until 1846, when he was appointed for recruiting service. He was promoted First lieutenant June 18, 1846, and took an active part in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War; he was present at Tampico and Vera Cruz. Beckwith was engaged in the Pacific Railroad Survey from 1853 to 1857 with John Williams Gunnison. Notably, the First Transcontinental Railroad followed his recommended route. His report, which also included an extensive survey of the Great Salt Lake, contained \\"much information on the plants, animals, climate, and geographical features of the lands he had explored\\". He succeeded Gunnison as leader of the survey after his death, and personally recommended the route for the railroad. He was also involved with constructing military roads in Nebraska and Kansas, between 1857‚Äì1859. Beckwith was promoted captain May 12, 1855, and served during the American Civil War in the commissary department from 1861 to 1865, with the exception of a few weeks in 1863, when he acted as provost-marshal-general of the department of the Gulf, and again when placed for a short time (August 1863 ‚Äì January 1864) in command of the defenses of New Orleans. On February 8, 1864, he was promoted major, and on March 13, 1865, was brevetted lieutenant-colonel, colonel, and brigadier-general of volunteers. He continued in the service of the commissary department until he was mustered out on May 31, 1866. Personal life Beckwith married Cornelia Williamson (1828‚Äì1911), with whom he had a daughter, Madeline Julia Beckwith (1852‚Äì1935). He died at Clifton, New York, in 1881, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

The episode was directed by Paris Barclay and written by Steven Bochco, David Milch, Bill Clark and Nicholas Wootton. It was the culmination of months of public speculation on the method of closure that would be employed to write Jimmy Smits's critically acclaimed Bobby Simone character out of the regular cast and clear the way for Smits' replacement, Rick Schroder. \\"Hearts and Souls\\" was a critical and commercial success, achieving both high ratings and positive critical feedback and is now regarded as one of the greatest television episodes in television history. It marked the second high-profile replacement of the partner for lead character Detective Andy Sipowicz, played by Dennis Franz. At the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards, this episode won awards for Direction for Paris Barclay and Guest Actress for Debra Monk as well as a nominations in Writing for Steven Bochco, David Milch, Bill Clark and Nicholas Wootton. Barclay also won a Directors Guild of America Award. The episode also won an Eddie Award and a Banff Rockie Award as well as a Cinema Audio Society Award nomination. This was Smits' last regular appearance as Simone, although he returned for one scene in an episode during the twelfth season. The episode highlights his rapid and mysterious physical demise, which has culminated in his need for a heart transplant. Many emotional portrayals are included to represent the feelings of loved ones, friends and colleagues when someone that they care about is suddenly in dire medical need. In another storyline, the episode simultaneously highlights the stress that can be caused when alcoholism afflicts a family through a critically acclaimed guest appearance by Debra Monk as the ex-wife of Sipowicz. Plot The episode begins with a special five-minute extended \\"Previously on NYPD Blue\\" segment that retraces Simone's (Jimmy Smits) whole character history. The final portion of the prologue presents Lt. Arthur Fancy's (James McDaniel) prior episode persuasion of a police widow to directly donate her husband's heart to give Simone a chance to live. The regular portion of the episode begins after the completed heart transplant. The episode focuses on whether Simone's heart transplant was successful. It starts ten days after the heart transplant with his anticipated hospital release. Simone's recovery is hampered by an internal chest infection, which leaves him weakened. The doctors attempt diagnosis of the infection and weakness, which appear to be minor, with tests. Tensions run high in the department from almost the beginning of the episode. Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) has a scene where his verbal aggression with a citizen complainant provides a respite and represents the frustration and helplessness of Simone's friends and colleagues. James Martinez' (Nicholas Turturro) generally good manners are also tested. Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) displays deep emotions to his wife ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence). The doctors differ in their opinions of which treatment to use. One advises Simone and wife Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) to pursue surgery, while another advises natural progression. Sipowicz's ex-wife Katie (Debra Monk) catches him offguard by appearing at the station drunk and asking for his help. She is preparing a pro se defense against DWI charges, but when Sipowicz is about to respond with assistance, she slips away. The personal turmoil drags him away from his compassionate watch. When he is distracted, Simone's health deteriorates to the point where his demise seems imminent. Dr. Carreras suggests ending the suffering, while Dr. Swan disagrees, but Carreras believes his sentiment is masking office politics that govern how statistics are attributed to various departments. Russell is conflicted on which doctor to take advice from. Sipowicz manages his wife's crisis by negotiating agreed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. After Simone receives his last rites, his colleagues say their goodbyes, while Simone dreams aloud of his mentor Patsy Ferrara. In Simone's waking dream, Patsy acts as a medium, helping Simone transition out of life. In the end, with his wife Russell, having removed his wedding ring, by his side, Simone, shedding a final tear, fades away, and the screen fades to white (as opposed to black). Production =Background= After one season on NYPD Blue, David Caruso decided to leave his role as Detective John Kelly and pursue a movie career when he was unable to secure a salary increase from $80,000 (US$ in dollars) per episode to $100,000 (US$). At the time, Caruso had a pending Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination for the 46th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1994. Meanwhile, ABC was enduring the odd combination of high ratings, high critical praise and largescale network affiliate boycotts of its breakthrough use of nudity and profanity on public television that forced it to offer discounted advertising rates in spite of its success. Smits, who had left his Emmy Award-winning role as Victor Sifuentes on L.A. Law in 1991, was signed as a replacement on August 18, 1994. Caruso would continue in his role for the first four episodes of the second season, and Smits replaced him in a new role in episode 5 in November. Smits originally hoped to sign with the show for three years, while ABC sought a more standard five-year contract. In April 1998, toward the end of the fifth season, Smits told Liz Smith that he would only perform in a handful of episodes in the sixth season in order to smoothly transition his character's departure. Smits declined interviews and made a written statement, but show creator Steven Bochco noted that Smits had come to the decision several weeks before he announced it. Smits earned five consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nominations as well as three nominations for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Television Series Drama for the Simone role. Smits, who earned the Golden Globe Award at the 53rd Golden Globe Awards in 1996 for the role, stated that \\"I accomplished what I sought to do - to prove I can act - and now it's time to seek another course.\\" In mid-June 1998, rumors surfaced that Rick Schroder would replace Smits. The following week, Schroder was officially announced as the replacement. By late September, the buildup the Smits' departure was set to commence with the first episode of season 6, on October 20. On October 7, ABC announced that Smits would be stabbed in the opening episode of the season. The week before the season premiere, Mark Tinker revealed that Smits would be written out in the fifth episode of the season and Schroder would enter in the subsequent episode. Bochco revealed that National Enquirer and other gossip tabloids had offered to pay for details about the storyline. The five-week story arc was scheduled so that the final three weeks were in the November sweeps with Schroder's debut marking the final week of the sweeps. When the network decided to pre-empt the show on Election Night (November 3), the final episode was moved back to the second last night of sweeps. The first week stabbing was regarded as similar to the murder of Jonathan Levin. ABC sent the media the first two episodes prior to the season 6 premiere. In the first episode, Smits is both stabbed and inadvertently cut by his dentist. Based on the first two episodes, Dave Matheny and Neal Justin of the Star Tribune determined that Simone would endure a worsening mysterious illness. In the third episode of the arc, Smits was hospitalized and in need of a heart transplant. The fourth episode was a buildup to impending heart surgery as he struggles with cardiomyopathy. =Writing= In April, Bochco stated that he did not intend to kill off Smits' character, Simone. On L.A. Law, Smits had returned to the show for critically acclaimed guest appearances during sweeps episodes after leaving his regular role. Whether Smits' character would overlap with Schroder's character on screen was undetermined when Schroder was announced in June, but at the time Season 6 production was scheduled to commence on August 10, 1998. As of mid-July, Smits' departing episode was not scheduled to film until September. On the eve of the season 6 premiere, NYPD Blue executives assured the public that Smits' storyline would not be irreversible. However, this led to doubt among critics who did not feel it was possible to have a sensible storyline that retained the services of Kim Delaney in the role of Simone's wife Detective Diane Russell. A humorous piece in Newsweek described the general consensus as \\"He's gonna die. He looks like he's dying...If he dies, it's easy to keep his wife (played by Kim Delaney) on the show.\\" In addition, his castmates noted that their characters would grieve. However, some sources, such as National Public Radio's Noah Adams and Robert Siegel, read into the fact that \\"Network publicity speaks of Simone's departure, not his demise...\\" =Filming= In late August, Schroder participated in a New York City Police Department ride-a-long to prepare for his role. Season 6 production began the week of September 5. David Milch, who had had multiple angioplasties influenced the storyline so that it would represent \\"the alienation and disempowerment that almost everyone feels in a hospital, without demonizing the hospital\\". Milch employed his brother, who is a doctor, as a consultant. He explained to his hometown newspaper, The Buffalo News, that the five-story arc was chosen because a surprise event would not have worked in this media age with the audience's expectation of the character's departure. According to Kim Delaney, during the filming of this episode the cast was repeatedly breaking down emotionally as if they were experiencing a personal death in the family. The 90-minute special extended into the Sports Night time slot that preceded NYPD Blue during the 1998‚Äì99 United States network television season. Smits appeared in the November 9, 2004 \\"The Vision Thing\\" episode in his only return guest performance. Cast *Jimmy Smits as Det. Bobby Simone *Dennis Franz as Det.

It was the largest overall viewership in three years for the series and the best 18-49 demographic rating in two years. =Critical commentary= Buildup Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe noted that the buildup to the finale added intrigue at the cost of cliche. John Levesque of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said \\"the whole six-episode arc strikes me as a B or B-minus effort that got bogged down in one character and gave us all-too-familiar subplots that were lacking in imagination.\\" Phil Rosenthal of the Chicago Sun-Times described the arc as a \\"lingering exit\\". Associated Press Television critic Frazier Moore found the entire story arc to be \\"a dramatic and fitting farewell for the character - and a proud performance by Smits\\". The Buffalo News describes the arc as \\"a brilliant five-episode story line\\". Episode Dusty Saunders of Rocky Mountain News described the farewell episode as \\"Unforgettable\\", praising several acting performances. Of Simone (Smits), he described his performance as \\"spellbinding\\" noting his \\"Particularly effective\\" and metaphorical scenes with his pigeons in addition to saying \\"Smits is not the first TV actor to portray a character, lying in bed, facing death. Such scenes are as common as headache relief commercials. However, Smits' compassionate portrayal is as realistic as weekly TV drama gets.\\" He described Russell (Delaney) as \\"...superb Tuesday night, displaying both helpless agony and feisty determination.\\" Although he praised her role as a wife, he noted that as a detective her dealings with her partner Det. Jill Kurkendall (Andrea Thompson) were clich√©d. He noted that Greg Medavoy's (Gordon Clapp) \\"...frustration epitomizes the concern of the precinct crew as it monitors Bobby's Simone's battle for life.\\" He noted that Sipowicz' (Franz) storyline with his first wife, Katie (Monk) \\"...provides a needed diversion from the hospital room drama.\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer Levesque claimed the finale had its ups and downs. He describes the Sipowicz subplot as the only \\"viable\\" one in the episode, stating that Monk's performance had \\"a frantic loneliness that almost brings the show back to its dark, gritty-streets realism\\". He claims this performance is tempered by the dramatic, but unrealistic \\"overwrought behavior\\" of Simone's fretful colleagues. He summarized the episode as \\"well written (by Nicholas Wootton) and generally well acted, with several characters having to experience a range of emotions\\", but was most disappointed in Delaney's performance as Russell. The Chicago Sun-Times Rosenthal described the episode as \\"wrenching\\" and a \\"powerful piece\\". He says the focus of the episode is whether Simone's transplant took and that the episode downplayed policework, while highlighting the interpersonal. He noted that the performance made Simone an Emmy Award favorite. He notes that a lot of emotions are displayed by Simone's colleagues and that the episode also has a meaningful secondary storyline in which Sipowicz shows volatility in the face of \\"Simone's uncertain health and the reappearance of his alcoholic ex-wife\\". Kevin Newman of ABC's Good Morning America described the finale as \\"very touching\\" and noted that Smits, himself, claimed to have warned his own mother not to watch because it would be \\"too emotional\\". The Associated Press' Moore described the episode as \\"moving\\". Immediately before the finale, The Boston Globe Gilbert praised the episode as \\"one of the series' most memorable\\" and \\"a highly emotional and yet restrained 90 minutes, with a satisfying resolution\\". He describes the special introduction as \\"a nice touch\\". He commends the writers for focusing the episode on \\"medical themes\\" rather than \\"crime investigation\\". He praises Delaney's performance over a range of emotions. He describes Monk's Katie Sipowicz \\"a prisoner of grief for their late son\\". He notes that Smits ends his NYPD Blue tenure with \\"grace and power\\". The Buffalo News describes the finale as a \\"heart-pounding resolution\\", noting that the final moment between Sipowicz and Simone was \\"also emotional despite its simplicity\\". They note that the medical ethics consideration outdoes ER. They note that the \\"acting is uniformly excellent\\", praising Smits in particular for conveying emotion without much dialogue as well as Delaney for \\"capturing Diane's anxiety and heartache\\". They praise the pigeon scenes' ability to complement to the symbolic achievement of the episode that lives up to its billing. Monica Collins of the Boston Herald said the episode \\"lives up to the hype\\" with \\"high melodrama\\" that offset \\"graceful, gutsy storytelling\\". She lauded the script, which delved into \\"the politics of medicine\\". The episode demonstrates the emotions of several relationships.

In the front row are two of his youngest students: Fou Ts'ong (front left) and Wu Yili (front right). Mario Paci (June 4, 1878 ‚Äì August 3, 1946), also known by his Chinese name Mei Baiqi (), was an Italian pianist and conductor who was instrumental in establishing classical European music in China. Life Paci was born in Florence. He attended the Naples Conservatory and in 1895 won the Franz Liszt Prize. Afterwards, he undertook extended tours across all of Europe. Through the support of Giacomo Puccini, he was able to study composition and conducting at the Milan Conservatory. In December 1918, Paci went to Shanghai to perform at the Olympic Theater. He was hospitalized after falling ill, and ended up deciding to stay in Shanghai. In 1919, he took the leadership of the predecessor of Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the oldest symphony orchestra in Asia, which had been founded in 1879 as a military wind band. Paci succeeded in having the orchestra grow from 22 to 37 members and gave the first symphonic concert in Asia on November 23, 1919. On the program was Beethoven's fifth symphony, the serenade for strings \\"In the Far West\\" by Granville Bantock, and Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite No. 1. In 1922 the orchestra was renamed the Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra. Initially, the audience was composed of foreigners living in Shanghai, who numbered about 20,000; at this time Chinese were not permitted to attend the concerts. Persistent pleas by Paci to the officials led to the loosening of these restrictions. This also applied to the orchestra itself, which originally was composed exclusively of foreigners, but later incorporated Chinese musicians. Paci's support also contributed to the founding of the National Special School for Music (ÂúãÁ´ã‰∏äÊµ∑Èü≥Ê®ÇÂ∞àÁßëÂ≠∏Ê†°), which was renamed the Shanghai Conservatory in 1956. This school, established by Cai Yuanpei and Xiao Youmei, was the first conservatory in Asia. Among the teachers there who were also members of the orchestra was the German composer Wolfgang Fraenkel (1897-1983), who fled Germany in 1938, and violinist Tan Shuzhen. A high point in the history of the orchestra was the Chinese premiere of Beethoven's ninth symphony on April 14, 1936, under the direction of Paci; by this point many Chinese were in the orchestra, although they were not among the singers. After Japanese invaded China in 1937 and the beginning of the Second World War, the situation for the orchestra became more severe. Paci was forced to dissolve the orchestra after giving his final performance on May 31, 1942. It was reestablished in October 1950, four years after Paci died in Shanghai. Paci trained some of China's first pianists, including Fou Ts'ong, Wu Yili, Wu Leyi Âê¥‰πêÊáø, Zhu Gongyi Êú±Â∑•‰∏Ä, and Zhou Guangren Âë®Âπø‰ªÅ.

The series primarily explores the impact of adoption, disability and unconventional relationships within families and communities. These themes had never previously been explored within a Syrian television drama. The romantic themes within Forbidden Love are highly contentious to Syrian culture and religion. The most controversial storyline in the series involves the complex relationship between the series‚Äô two protagonists, Sarah (an adopted daughter) and Dr. Wael (her adoptive father). The series explores the reactions of community and kin to this relationship, and depicts the moral dilemmas of characters in deciding whether to condone or condemn the relationship. The series also involves depictions of adultery, greed, manipulation, illegal business dealings and a relationship between characters where a significant age disparity exists. Production Forbidden Love began shooting in mid-March 2011, inadvertently coinciding with the start of the \\"Arab Spring\\" protests. Many production companies declined the option to finance the series, as they were nervous about the Syrian political situation disrupting the shooting. However, Golden Line agreed to the project, aspiring to be a Syrian company capable of delivering a reliable commodity in the midst of political turmoil. As of April 2012, Forbidden Love has been filmed amongst neighborhoods in Damascus and Ghouta without incident. To attract a maximum viewing audience, the series premiered during Ramadan 2011. =Broadcast on satellite channels= *Infinity Channel *Infinity 2 Channel *Amwaj Channel *Majan Channel *Syria Drama Channel *New TV Channel *Arabia Drama Channel Reception Since premiering in September 2011, The Forbidden Love series has broadcast continually to Arabic speaking communities across the Middle East, despite the program causing controversy amongst some sections of the community. Primarily, the series has provoked criticism in the Arabic language press, including e-Sama Syria, a Syrian newspaper; October, a Syrian art magazine; and Al Itthihad, a newspaper printed in the United Arab Emirates. The series explores a number of subjects, including incest, which are highly taboo in Arabic culture. Critics of the series have accused it of \\"unraveling morality\\" and have demanded an end to the program. The campaign against the series has also involved threats to prosecute the satellite channels which broadcast the program. However, the series has a strong fan base, which was apparent within 10 days of the program being launched when it attracted over 80,000 YouTube downloads. Social networking sites have provided fertile ground for supporters and opponents of the series to promote their perceptions of the program's values. These sites have also provided a space for supporters and opponents to engage in dialogue about the program, and to explore the culturally acceptable limits of popular media in highlighting and challenging cultural taboos. As incest is such an emotive and taboo topic in many cultures, including Arab cultures, many people have been confronted by the series' exploration of this issue. Consequently, there have been a high number of sharp attacks on the program and its cast through social networking sites.

Inclusion Melbourne provides day service activities to adults with intellectual disabilities. Its head office is in Armadale, and the group provides day services to people in twelve municipalities of Melbourne, for disabilities over the full spectrum of impairment. History Inclusion Melbourne was founded in 1948 by a group of parents of children with intellectual disabilities who met informally in a small church hall in South Yarra. The cause for these meetings was a wish by the parents for something other than institutional care, which at this time they considered overcrowded and unhygienic, for their children.Breaking Wishbones: the story of Gawith Villa, Breaking Wishbones, 2003, page 10. In 1951, the Helping Hand League of Victoria (which became known as the Helping Hand Association for Sub-Normal Children) formed a number of sub-branches, including the Prahran-South Yarra sub-branch, with Stan Glassborow as the inaugural president. In 1954, with the support of the then-Mayor of Prahran Charles Gawith, the sub-branch became an independent organisation called Gawith Villa. In that year, Queen Elizabeth II visited Prahran at a Command Variety Performance, with all the proceeds donated to Gawith Villa.Breaking Wishbones: the story of Gawith Villa, Breaking Wishbones, 2003, page 7. Gawith Villa's change from day service to individualised care commenced in the early 1990s with the appointment of Prof Errol Cocks, formally the Director of Disability Services, Victoria. From this point, Gawith Villa aimed to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities were included in the community, rather than shut away in centres.Essential lifestyle planning, Rouget, D., Bell, E., Essential lifestyle planning, 2000. In the same year Gawith Villa's literacy and numeracy training programs started. In 2007, Gawith Villa sold its centre in Sutherland Road, Armadale. All day services from this point were based in the community. Gawith Villa renamed itself in 2008 to Inclusion Melbourne Inc, reflecting that it no longer provided centre-based day services. Volunteers Inclusion Melbourne makes significant use of volunteers. With a paid staff to volunteer ratio of over ten to one, Inclusion Melbourne has the highest involvement of volunteers supporting people with intellectual disabilities in the sector.Self Directed Approaches: Example of Innovative Practice Self Directed Approaches: Example of Innovative Practice, National Disability Service, 2010.

Earlier, it had been a sub- station of St. Anthony's Church, Pudupet. A new church was built in 1952 with the name Queenship of Mary; it was consecrated on 18, December 1955 by Auxiliary Bishop Francis Arthur Carvalho, of Madras and Mylapore. Under the supervision of Reverend M. V. Jacob, a new church was constructed on 1 October 2003. A grotto was built in commemoration of the centenary celebrations in 2004. History The Queenship of Mary Church, then known as St. Lazarus Church, with about 2500 members, was erected in Madras (now Chennai), near the Ripon Building and the Corporation of Madras. Originally, St. Lazarus was not meant to be a parish church. It was a chapel attached to St. Anthony's Church of Pudupet. The earliest references to this church, as a separate ecclesiastical unit, are from 1904, when it was raised to the status of a parochial church with the parish priest residing in Pudupet. On the transfer of the spiritual jurisdiction in 1929 and division of Madras by the river Cooum, Madras and Mylapore became like two different cities. The churches on the eastern bank of the river were to be taken over by the Mylapore Diocese and those on the western side from part of the Archdiocese of Madras. While therefore Mylapore handed over one of the best city churches, Sacred Heart of Egmore, Mylapore got in return St. Lazarus of Chintadripet with St. Antony's of Narasingapuram, located on Ritchie's Street, close to Mount Road. There were two St. Lazarus Churches, within the city. One in Mylapore close to Mae de Deus Church (the name Madras is derived from the name of this church), and the other in the slum area of Chintadripet. It is unknown why there were two churches in Madras dedicated to St. Lazarus. It is possible that a sense of rivalry brought into existence the St. Lazarus of Chintadripet, while the older one (which had grown in fame as a shrine where devotes flocked and still do come round every Tuesday) that one in Mylapore, as it is stated elsewhere, it may safely be assumed that it is now more than three centuries old, while that in Chintadripet is comparatively younger, having been built at the earliest in 1904. As far as historical data go, owing to the absence of records, the origin and the early history of St. Lazarus Chintadripet is unknown. However, there is a strong tradition that St. Francis Xavier visited this parish. = Re-dedication = Originally this parish was dedicated to St. Lazarus, after the Second Vatican Council, it was rededicated to the Queenship of Mary on 18 December 1955, on the recommendations of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. = Revelation of Our Lady = The Most Holy and Miraculous Mother of Chintadripet is said to have revealed herself to a poor Hindu lady, Mrs. Devi, who lived in the slum adjacent to the church, at 11:00 am, on 14 August 2007.

It won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novella in 1979. It was included in the anthology of the same name and in The John Varley Reader. Plot summary A keen drifter describes the dismal political state of the world following a general collapse. He comes upon a commune of people who are blind and deaf. Much of the story details the culture and personal habits of the people. As their main cultural activity the commune uses different levels of touch-based communication on a regular basis, perhaps 3-4 times a week, in group sessions. These occur after work done during the days. Through these sensory communication encounters the protagonist develops strong bonds with several of the members. The commune members emphasize mutual understanding to overcome their physical limitations. Their rich use of unspoken/unseen tactile language is used to establish intense clarity about others, a depth of clarity unobtainable using the senses of hearing and vision conventionally. Sex is part of their communication language.

Led by Paula Martelo, The Terrible Ones are the widows of men executed for plotting to overthrow former Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. Carter also has to investigate the nature of Operation Blast and stop it. The Terrible Ones are searching for a US$100 million ($700 million in 2012)http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ horde of gold and precious stones reputedly hidden by Trujillo. Also searching for the Trujillo Treasure is Dr Tsing-fu Shu, a Chinese communist intelligence officer. The location of the treasure has been encoded in a series of separate clues known only to a handful of Trujillo's most trusted advisers. Based on one of the clues supposedly referring to a castle or fortress of some kind, Tsing-fu is conducting excavations in the dungeons of the Citadelle Laferriere in Haiti. If discovered, the treasure will enable the Chinese to fund Operation Blast and make Haiti a puppet state under the control of China. Carter and Paula Martelo discover that the Citadelle is not the location of the buried treasure and head for Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. They arrive at the secret headquarters of The Terrible Ones and find it has been captured by three Cuban fidelistas. Carter is tied up and interrogated but escapes by using Pierre ‚Äì the poison gas bomb. With the help of The Terrible Ones he plants the bodies of the fidelistas in the Chinese restaurant in Santo Domingo used as a front by Tsing-fu and retrieves a map showing the locations of planned short-range missile bases dotted around the Caribbean designed to control the sea passages and restrict US shipping ‚Äì the true nature of Operation Blast. Carter asks The Terrible Ones to search through their husbands' belongings for possible clues to the location of the treasure. Eventually, the location is identified as the \\"Valley of the Shadow\\" ‚Äì a small dark valley on the outskirts of Santo Domingo in which an obscure sect of black-cowled monks have built a fortified monastery. Carter and eight of The Terrible Ones go to investigate. The monastery has been attacked and overrun by Tsing-fu and his soldiers who have also discovered the true location of the treasure by tracking down and torturing former Trujillo aides. After a fierce firefight, Carter kills Tsing-fu and his men. The treasure has been sealed up inside the body of a huge plaster saint in the monastery chapel. The abbot gives up the treasure to The Terrible Ones. As Carter and a few of The Terrible Ones try to leave the valley with the treasure they are ambushed by Cuban fidelistas. Paula is killed and Carter is wounded. The attackers are all killed. Carter recovers in hospital treasuring a ruby ring once owned by Paula.

The lagoon is an important habitat for resident and migratory birds with seventy three different species being recorded. The expansion in the area of Leptocarpus rushes that has been observed over a 47-year period in the lagoon have been attributed to artificial openings of the lagoon to the sea, and the increase in sedimentation. The lagoon is largely unmodified by human activity but there are elevated nutrient levels and sedimentation with a fear that it may lead to eutrophication.

History In the late 19th century, Frederiksberg Municipality struggled with disposing of trash from its fast- growing population. Due to the lack of tips in the small independent municipality, household trash from the some 75,000 inhabitants accumulated and increasingly constituted a health hazard. The first facility of its kind in Denmark, Frederiksberg Incineration Plant was built in 1903 to a design by Heinrich Wenck, most known for his work as head architect for the Danish State Railways. The heat from the incineration was led via tunnels and tubes to nearby Frederiksberg Hospital, an orphanage and a poorhouse. The steam was used for driving the turbines in an electricity plant. A district heating plant was built at the site in the 1980s. The old buildings was decommissioned in 2000. Buildings The buildings today The plant originally consisted of several buildings. A single complex of interconnected volumes still exists today. It consists of the former electricity plant and a boilerhouse which are placed parallel but offset relative to each other.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle for the churches in Galatia, written between 49‚Äì58 CE. This chapter contains the meeting account of Paul, Barnabas and Christians in Jerusalem, considered as \\"one of the most momentous events in the earliest Christianity\\", and the dispute between Paul and Peter.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 21 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (~AD 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Papyrus 99 (~400) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 1, 8-9, 16-17) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) Conference in Jerusalem (2:1‚Äì10) The handclasp symbol (Galatians 2:9) and the words \\"I Am Alpha and Omega\\" above it on the Salt Lake Temple (Ben P.L.; 2018). Scholars generally connect the meeting described in this part with the accounts in and/or , although the details are unclear. = Verse 1 = : Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with me. NKJV *\\"After 14 years\\" most likely refers to \\"Paul's call\\" (), not to his visit to Cephas (). =Verse 9= :and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. NKJV *\\"James, Cephas, and John\\": James was a brother of Jesus Christ, attributed to the Epistle of James, gave the famous speech in the synod at Jerusalem (Acts 15:13), presided in the church in Jerusalem, was a man of great holiness, and much esteemed by the followers of Jesus. Cephas is the name that was given by Christ to Simon Peter () and in the Syriac language signifies a \\"stone\\", as the word \\"Peter\\" does in the Greek, to which Jesus alludes, (). John was the evangelist, and the same that wrote the epistles, was the beloved disciple, and who outlived all the rest. *\\"Who seemed to be pillars\\" (pillars: Greek œÉœÑ·ø¶ŒªŒøŒπ, 'Galatians 2:9 in Greek - Biblehub.com): they were considered \\"the very chief of the apostles\\" (cf. ; ). *\\"The right hand of fellowship\\": a token of a covenant or agreement between them, taking them into partnership with them, admitted them as apostles into their society, and gave their full consent, to show their joint agreement, used the above rite; which was used among other nations,Alex. ab Alex.

The absence of the outcome report indicates that this issue has influenced the tensions in the Galatians churches, which is addressed in this epistle. =Verse 11= : Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; NKJV This serves as a summary of the confrontation between Paul and Peter, which leads to the discussion of the main issue in 2:15‚Äì21. Works of Law or Faith? (2:15‚Äì21) In this part, Paul details the theological reasons of his dispute with Peter. In verse 17 Paul uses the word 'we'/'our' to show that both he and Peter actually agreed about the justification by faith only, and based on this mutual conviction Paul confronted Peter when Peter became inconsistent. =Verse 16= :knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. NKJV \\"Justified\\": \\"declared righteous\\".Note [i] on Galatians 2:16 in the NKJV =Verse 20= :I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. NKJV In Paul's belief, a believer 'dies to the law' through the crucifixion and death of Christ, and has the new life that is \\"no longer self-centered, but Christ-centered\\", the resurrection life where the risen Christ lives in. =Verse 21= :I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing. HCSB *\\"Set aside (NASB: \\"nullifying\\") the grace of God\\": that is \\"by receiving it and then going on as though it made no difference\\", either by \\"continuing to live under the law\\" or by \\"continuing to sin\\".

He was appointed Governor of Anatolia, and in 1544 was nominated fourth Vizier.

Appointed again lieutenant Governor of the Capital from 1553 to 1555, after the comeback of the Sultan to Istanbul he was forced to retire because of his old age. Ibrahim Pasha died in 1562. He followed a modest lifestyle and was among the few Court Eunuchs who enjoined unanimously a high reputation. Legacy In 1551 he commissioned Court Architect () Sinan to erect his funerary mosque in Istanbul, in the neighborhood of the Gate of Silivri (). On January 21, 1562, he established an endowment (), which was entitled to administer several institutions in the western part of Istanbul. These were: his Friday mosque with an elementary school in the Silivrikapƒ± neighborhood ; another school near Silivrikapƒ±; a Byzantine church which he had converted into a mosque, with an attached medrese and an elementary school (also erected by Sinan) near the Isakapƒ± Gate;M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 118. another elementary school near the Column of Arcadius and a water well for travellers outside Yenikapƒ± Gate. The endowment was to be financed through villages donated by the Sultan, fields, shops and mills in Rumelia, and buildings in Edirne and Istanbul. The Waqf was administered by the Chief white eunuch of Topkapi. The location of these establishments in sparsely settled neighborhoods along the Walls, where the population was predominantly Christian, shows his desire of pursuing a policy of islamization of the city.

Wu had the opportunity to collaborate with Margaret Atwood for the Book Lovers Ball, hosted in support of the Toronto Public Library in January 2012. Wu created designs inspired by Margaret Atwood's book \\"In Other Worlds\\". Margaret tweeted that Adrienne Wu is \\"a brilliant designer\\". In March 2012, Adrienne Wu was also involved with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada in Wu's annual event The Heart Truth Foundation. Jessi Cruikshank, eTalk's Host modeled the Heart Truth Fashion Show's opening dress. Later that month, Canada's Got Talent Host Dina Pugliese modeled Adrienne Wu's custom designed dress for the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show. The annual Steven Lewis Foundation Fashion Show was Toronto Fashion Week's Finale show featuring the top 16 designers of Canada. Celebrity models included Jeanne Beker and Bob Marley's grand daughter, Donisha Prendergast. Wu has dressed celebrities such as Jessi Cruickshank, Keshia Chante, Dina Pugliese, Kreesha Turner, and Christine Avanti. Wu has been covered by various publications including Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa Life Magazine, Dresstokill Magazine, Huffington Post, Hamilton Spectator, Burlington Post, Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, The Vancouver Sun, World Journal, Flare Magazine, Fashion Magazine, ELLE Magazine, and the National Post. [21] Wu has also been covered by such television news programs like Fashion Television, Sun News, CityTV, CBC, CTV, AChannel, eTalk, and Associated Press. Wu designed a tutu for The National Ballet of Canada's 60th anniversary celebration which is to be debuted late 2012. Wu has also recently been commissioned to their second corporate collaboration recently. Wu was to create a dress out of toilet paper for Cashmere (previously known as Cottonelle). Cashmere plans to launch this collection in September 2012. Wu became a spokesperson for Perrier as an official social influencer in 2012.  Criticism  = Debut = After Wu's debut at Toronto Fashion Week late 2011, Natalie Atkinson of the National Post criticized them for \\"threads hanging from the seam\\" and sending \\"unabashedly hairy-legged boys\\" down the runway. She concluded the review with \\"...if Wu is earnest, I would urgently refer Wu to land an internship at Comme des Gar√ßons or Margiela\\". Fashion Magazine called Wu 'overwrought' and Flare Magazine has said \\"One of the most unforgettable shows we saw this season\\". = Gawker = In early 2012, Wu had their \\"Hierarchy of Needs\\" FW12 show at Toronto Fashion Week, which involved models wearing Guy Fawkes masks. This caused controversy quoting the Toronto Star to say, \\"message baffles audience\\". Wu also caught the attention of Gawker, which questioned the designer's judgment for citing the group Anonymous.  Personal life  In 2015, Adrienne Wu came out to the public as neutrois, a non-binary gender identity and started going by gender-neutral pronouns. In the following year, Wu wrote an article on the Medium explaining the concept of being non-binary and how it differs greatly from other transgender identities. Wu has since openly participated in the Trans Fusion drop-ins at the Sherbourne Health Centre in Toronto, advocating for the visibility of non-binary identities within the vast spectrum of gender diversity. Wu frequently posts video updates about their transition journey on their personal YouTube channel as of 2016. In 2017, Wu changed their name to Adrienne, from Adrian. Reception Canadian fashion ranking aggregate website Canadian-Fashion.ca rated Adrienne Wu 2 out of 5 stars for their body of work. Fashionmagazine reviewed Wu's debut collection saying it, \\"...failed to impress\\". It later went on to write, \\"While the gowns themselves were quite striking in a palette of muted colours and constructed to Wu's signature voluminous style, it was not the focus of the audience, and apparently not that of its either. On more than a few pieces, faulty zippers and rogue hem threads stuck out like sore sartorial thumbs.\\"http://www.fashionmagazine.com/fashion/at-the-shows/2011/10/25/tfw- diary-adrian-wus-overwrought-lg-fashion-week-debut-fails-to-impress/ References Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People with HIV/AIDS Category:People from Burlington, Ontario Category:Canadian people of Hong Kong descent Category:Canadian fashion designers Category:Fashion stylists Category:LGBT fashion designers Category:Transgender non-binary people ","title":"Adrienne Wu"},{"id":"35515376","text":"Eduard Pestel (rechts), 1973 Eduard Kurt Christian Pestel (born 29 May 1914 in Hildesheim, died 19 September 1988 in Hannover) was a German industrial designerNational Academy of Engineering (1994) \\"EDUARD C.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 15, 2012. Plot Numerous food trucks are parking on the street in front of the restaurant, stealing the customers. After several failed attempts to make the trucks leave, Bob ends up buying a food truck of his own. Teddy fixes up the truck, warning Bob that the grill cannot be on at the same time as the truck or it could result in a massive fireball. Gene proceeds to destroy the truck this way, and Teddy fixes it up again. Bob and the kids work from inside the truck and Linda is forced to stay inside watching the restaurant. The food truck is doing well and Bob decides to take it on the go to get more money. Soon after, Linda shuts down the restaurant to join them on the road. Bob laments to Randy Watkins (Paul F. Tompkins) that he is still not turning a profit, and Randy mentions \\"Lolla-Pa- Foods-A\\" which has a $1,000 prize for the best food truck. The Belchers hit the road to the festival, with Linda driving who quickly gets road rage. At the festival, Tina, who has reinvented herself as Dina, hands out free mini burgers to promote the truck and lying about the contents of the burgers to the festival-goers. Louise and Gene taste-test other food truck fare and give bad reviews online, giving Bob's truck more business. Bob ends up winning the $1,000 prize before Linda accidentally letting the festival-goers in on one of the various lies. A riot ensues, and the Belchers (and Randy) are forced to hide in their food truck. After the festival-goers fall asleep, they manage to get away in the food truck before Randy starts the grill while driving, causing an explosion that forces everyone to walk back to town. Reception The episode received a 1.9 rating and was watched by a total of 3.90 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to The Cleveland Show, Family Guy and The Simpsons with 4.96 million. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying \\"So much of the episode hinges on the Bob-Randy relationship, and their move from rivals to, well, more-friendly rivals doesn‚Äôt lead anywhere. Most of the rest of the episode works, though not as well as normal.... After the highs of this second season, ‚ÄúFood Truckin‚Äô‚Äù is a mild disappointment.\\" References External links  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 2) episodes Category:Food trucks ","title":"Food Truckin'"},{"id":"35515384","text":"Koyo (Ekoyo) is a Bantu language of the Republic of Congo.

The species was discovered at abyssal depths when submersible vehicles such as DSV Alvin began exploring the deep ocean. It occurs on the sea bed, often in great numbers, close to hydrothermal vents where hot, sulphur-rich water wells up through the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Description Bathymodiolus thermophilus is a very large mussel with a dark brown periostracum, growing to a length of about . It is attached to rocks on the seabed by byssus threads but it is able to detach itself and move to a different location. It is sometimes very abundant, having been recorded at densities of up to 300 individuals per square metre (270 per square yard).Hydrothermal vents Deep Ocean. Retrieved 2012-04-15. Distribution Bathymodiolus thermophilus is found clustered around deep sea thermal vents on the East Pacific Rise between 13¬∞N and 22¬∞S and in the nearby Galapagos Rift at depths around 2800 metres (one and a half miles).Deep-Sea Vent Mussels Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Retrieved 2012-04-15. Biology Bathymodiolus thermophilus has chemosymbiotic bacteria in its gills which oxidise hydrogen sulfide. The mussel absorbs nutrients synthesized by these bacteria and is not reliant on photosynthetically produced organic matter. However it also feeds by extracting suspended food particles from the surrounding water through its gills. Mostly these are the bacteria that live around the vent, often forming a dense mat. When some mussels were transplanted from a sulphur-rich vent to another site lacking sulphur compounds, the symbiont bacteria died and the mussels suffered gill deterioration and loss of condition. This led researchers to believe that the mussels would be unable to survive when the flow of sulphur-rich water from their ephemeral vents runs out. The larvae of Bathymodiolus thermophilus drift with the currents and are planktotrophic, feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton. This method of feeding is likely to give them good dispersal capabilities and it has been shown by DNA analysis that there is a high rate of gene flow between populations round different vents.

It has been used in streetball, Camp Nama, torture, and medical malpractice. Streetball origins The phrase \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" is commonly used in Streetball. Streetball is a version of Basketball played in the streets. It typically has fewer rules, no referee, and is generally rougher than basketball. \\"Within the context of sport, aggressive acts are often viewed as instrumentally useful to the initiator and are consequently likely to be valued\\". In regular basketball, the National Basketball Association defines a foul by saying, \\"A player shall not hold, push, charge into, impede the progress of an opponent by extending a hand, forearm, leg or knee or by bending the body into a position that is not normal. Contact that results in the re-routing of an opponent is a foul which must be called immediately\\". In Streetball, pushing and shoving is acceptable provided no serious damage (typically drawing blood) is done. Hence the phrase \\"No Blood, No Foul\\". Camp Nama sign In Camp Nama a sign was posted that read, \\"No Blood, No Foul: The High Five Paintball Club\\". \\"One Defense Department specialist recalled seeing pink blotches on detainees' clothing as well as red welts on their bodies, marks he learned later were inflicted by soldiers who used detainees as targets and called themselves the High Five Paintball Club\\". The phrase \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" grew to sum up the entire camp as it was posted around the camp and torture chambers. An official of the Defense Department explained the slogan by saying,\\" [it] reflected an adage adopted by Task Force 6-26: \\"If you don't make them bleed, they can't prosecute for it.\\" or in other words \\"torture that leaves no scars is hard to prove\\". Torture Memos Much of the recent history of the \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" policy was shaped by the so-called Torture Memos (also called the Bybee- Yoo memorandum). The Torture Memos were written in the wake of the attack on 9/11. They detail approved interrogation techniques by evaluating proposed techniques in terms of International Statutes. They give approval to techniques such as walling (shoving a prisoner into a false flexible wall in order to disorient them), sleep deprivation, putting a benign insect in the prisoners box while telling them it is a stinging insect, the use of stress positions, and water boarding. They are evaluated to be legal and not constitute torture because they do not cause severe physical or mental pain or suffering (Bybee). \\"The Bybee Memorandum which was widely used as a legal basis for far-reaching interrogation methods explicitly authorized against terrorist suspects, concluded by stating that 'even if an interrogation method might violate Section 2340A, necessity or self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability\\". Because of these memos it has been said that the \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" policy evolved from the White House and Pentagon, \\"'No blood, no foul,' [was] the punch line that the Defense Department drew from the Bybee-Yoo memorandum\\". Extending to doctors The philosophy has been extended to physicians as well in two notable areas: torture and malpractice. =Torture= Torture (in the context of interrogation) has been defined as, \\"Physically and/or psychologically painful methods designed to elicit information from an individual\\". \\"With respect to the last few decades, increasing evidence indicates that doctors are frequently involved when torture is carried out\\". Physicians aided the military in its torture of prisoners in Camp Nama when the phrase was applied to them. The Secretary of U.S. Torture policy said, \\" The use of isolation as an interrogation technique requires detailed implementation instructions ... including medical and psychological review ... including the presence or availability of qualified medical personnel.\\". In Guantanamo, \\"doctors were made to agree to torture in advance and to live by the motto: \\"No blood, no foul.\\" They practiced the art of sleep deprivation, hypothermia, withholding food and treatment of injuries, among other abuses\\". In the interrogation log for Mohammed al-Qhatani it is revealed that, \\"doctors were present during the long process of constant sleep deprivation over 55 days, and they induced hypothermia and the use of threatening dogs, among other techniques\\". Physicians and Psychologists use of the \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" policy to get around their Hippocratic oaths have sparked controversy, \\"It is unthinkable that any psychologist could assert that stress positions, forced nudity, sleep deprivation, exploiting phobias, and waterboarding ‚Äî along with other forms of torture techniques that the American Psychological Association has condemned and prohibited ‚Äî cause no lasting damage to a human being's psyche\\". \\"The American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association adopted Position Statements absolutely prohibiting their members from participating in torture under any and all circumstances, and, to a limited degree, forbidding involvement in interrogations\\".Halpern, Abraham L \\"Enhanced\\" interrogation of detainees: do psychologists and psychiatrists participate? =Malpractice= The use of the \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" policy has been extended to medical malpractice. The Improve Patient Safety Summit 2001 established that in medicine the \\"No Blood, No Foul\\" philosophy, \\"assumes no harm has been done if a patient is not injured.\\". Dr. Bagian, director of the National Center for Patient Safety at the VA, said about the \\"No Blood, No Foul Policy\\", \\"That's true for tort, if you don't hurt people, you don't have to pay\\".

It was the home of the prosperous Merritt family, who occupied from its completion in 1817 until 1958. It was taken over by the New Brunswick Historical Society in 1961. Its current address is 120 Union Street. History The Merritt family were United Empire Loyalists, originally from Rye, New York. In May 1783, along with approximately 6,000 other loyalists, they landed at Parrtown, New Brunswick, having fled the American Revolution. The patriarch of the Saint John Merritts, Thomas Merritt (1729‚Äì1821), lived with his wife and seven children in Parrtown (what is now the south end of the City of Saint John). Despite being initially of \\"modest circumstances,\\" the family soon became prominent in the city, with the second generation amassing great wealth. David Daniel Merritt, the third of Thomas' sons and a wealthy shop keeper, purchased the Loyalist House property, on which construction began in 1810. The house took until 1817 to complete, likely due to the War of 1812. The property was, at that time, just within the city limits, Union street being its northern border until 1889. As a consequence, the area surrounding the property was sparsely populated, allowing the Merritts to keep livestock well into the later half of the century. While the house was originally at street level, as the city expanded the streets were dug down to lessen the strain on the draught horses coming up Germain Street. This created the elevated look of the house, which can be seen in the above photo. The family owned the house until 1961, and lived in it on and off until the death of Louis Merritt Harrison, in 1958. The house was then occupied by Mr. Harrison's housekeeper until the sale of the property to K C Irving and an associate, in 1961, at which point the New Brunswick Historical Society opened the house as a museum. Architecture Loyalist House is often claimed to be the oldest structurally unaltered building in Saint John, most of its contemporaries having been destroyed in the Great Fire of 1877. The house was built in the New England Federalist style, in keeping with the cultural background of its owners. The structure consists of two-and-a-half storeys, with the western half having been built on a stone and mortar cellar. The two main floors, which comprised the family living quarters, are identical in layout and almost completely symmetrical. They contained the living and dining rooms, the kitchen, the study, four bedrooms and numerous family and servant halls. The features of the living area include a main and servants' staircase, centralized bell system, four chimneys with two fireplaces each, and thirty one large windows. It was fitted with gas lighting, though the system was disabled by the family and there is little that remains of it today. The top floor was used as servants' quarters, containing five rooms. There is speculation that one of these rooms was a servants' dining room and lounge. The adjacent room, which is small and houses numerous shelves, is joined to it by a window as if it were a bar. While this floor features numerous skylights added by the later Merritts, originally it would have had no windows. Also on the property is a carriage house. Originally double its current length, it housed the Merritt's carriage, sleigh, and livestock. The Loyalists used a heated frying pan to keep them warm in the night. In 2017, Loyalist House underwent a $600,000 refurbishment. Museum The Loyalist House museum comprises most of the two main floors of the house, with other areas used as office space and storage. It is furnished with multiple examples of high quality Georgian and Victorian furniture, supplied from the collections of the New Brunswick Historical Society, the New Brunswick Museum, and Kings Landing Historical Settlement. It is open during regular business hours from Loyalist Day, on May 18, until the beginning of September, though it opens for cruise ships well into autumn. Guided tours of the house are available at all times, with particular emphasis being placed on the Merritt family and the lives of wealthy Saint Johners during the 19th century. Affiliations Loyalist House is affiliated with numerous heritage organization throughout New Brunswick, such as the Fundy Heritage Zone, as well as the federal and provincial governments.

It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and writer Frank Pierson, and directed by main cast member John Slattery. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on April 15, 2012. The episode takes place between July 1966 and August 1966, with references to the 1966 World Cup Final, the Charles Whitman shooting rampage, and the crash of Braniff Flight 250. Business and pleasure converge on each other at both a dinner party thrown by the Campbells and a misguided whorehouse visit intended to woo a client. Pete discovers that Ken is writing science fiction under a pseudonym, which angers Roger Sterling. Pete's emasculation continues after a routine office meeting ends in fisticuffs. The episode's title is derived from the infamous 1959 driving safety film of the same name, which Pete Campbell is required to watch as part of his driver's education class. The film, shown widely to high school students across the country during the 1960s, was produced by the Ohio State Highway Patrol and takes its name from the radio code used by that agency for a fatal traffic accident. \\"Signal 30\\" received 2.69 million viewers and a 1.0 in the coveted 18-49 demographic. It was met with rave reviews, with many commentators calling it the best episode of the season so far. Critics commended John Slattery for his directing work. Matthew Weiner and his Academy Award-winning co-writer Frank Pierson were also praised for the symbolism of the leaking faucet and the character study of Pete Campbell. Plot Pete is being kept awake by a leaking faucet in the kitchen. He eventually goes to fix it, doing so effectively and with self- satisfaction. He is later shown attending a driver's education class, where he flirts with a teenage girl about to go off to college. Ken Cosgrove has continued his writing and runs into Peggy while meeting with a publisher over lunch. He is secretive about his work and attempts to politely get rid of her. Peggy is unsettled by this, until Ken later explains his actions in the office. Following a drunken celebration at a bar with other expatriates over England's 1966 World Cup victory, Lane excitedly tells the other SCDP partners that he has arranged a lunch meeting with a fellow Englishman, Edwin Baker, over possible representation for Jaguar Cars in America. The Campbells throw a dinner party for the Cosgroves and the Drapers at their home. As the night progresses, Ken's writing career is accidentally brought up in conversation by his wife, leading to a retelling of one of his stories. The guests are unsure of how to react to the science fiction plot, apart from Don, who asks questions about the character. When Don learns of Ken's writing success he is supportive of it; in contrast, Pete denigrates it. Afterwards, the wives retreat to the kitchen, where the faucet Pete previously \\"fixed\\" bursts, spraying water everywhere. Pete rushes away to get his toolbox, but by the time he returns, Don has already fixed it, explaining that Pete's previous fix was merely a coincidence. Pete returns to his driver's ed class to find that a new student, Hanson (nicknamed \\"handsome\\"), has the attention of the girl Pete previously flirted with. Roger advises Lane about how to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it relatable to himself, forming a \\"conspiracy\\" of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, but he wants to have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away. The next day, Roger calls Ken into his office and bluntly tells Ken to stop writing in his spare time, as he should not be diverting any attention from his job. Roger attempts to create a bond between them, stating they are both \\"unappreciated authors\\" (referencing the autobiography Roger was dictating in Season 4), but Ken has none of it. Later that day, Lane storms into a partners' meeting, shouting at Pete about how Edwin's wife has found out about Edwin's adultery and is devastated; Edwin has withdrawn his business as a result. Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds by citing Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his blunder, claiming that he'd done to Pete what everyone in the office had wanted to do for some time. Peggy, excitedly, tells Ken about Lane's beating up Pete. Ken takes pleasure in this, and then tells Peggy about his conversation with Roger. Ken suspects Pete informed Roger, after learning about his publishing deal during the dinner party. Later, Pete talks about his despair at the day's events with Don in the elevator, wondering how the fight occurred, when he thought they were all friends. Close to tears, he blurts out that he has nothing. Don doesn't respond. The episode ends with Ken writing about a character whose situation reflects Pete's. Pete is shown back in his driver's ed class, watching helplessly as Hanson effortlessly seduces the girl Pete had his eyes on, while the dripping sound of the leaky faucet replays in his mind. Production Creator Matthew Weiner co-wrote the episode with 86-year-old veteran screenwriter and Academy Award winner (for Dog Day Afternoon) Frank Pierson. Pierson offered Weiner his writing services back in 2009, leading him to serve as a consulting producer on the third season. About Pierson, Weiner said, \\"He's now in the writer's room. Arguably one of the greatest living writers. It means you're doing something right.\\" Cast member John Slattery, who portrays Roger Sterling on the series, directed the episode, the third time he has directed for the series. Weiner stated that the episode was about the question -- \\"What do you want?\\" and \\"Do you ever get a chance to have it?\\", as well as the \\"tentative nature of business friendships\\". He used Lane's friendship with the Jaguar executive and the dinner at Pete Campbell's house as examples. Vincent Kartheiser reasoned that Pete invited them over to show off his wife, home, and success. Jon Hamm elaborated on Don's reluctance to go as his desire to keep his relationship separate from the poisonous influence of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Jon Hamm pointed to Don's bad history with whorehouses as to his reluctance to take part in the festivities, while noting that \\"Pete has no such problem.\\" Of Pete's scene with the prostitute, Weiner said, \\"You see what his fantasy is. You see his powerlessness\\" and that Pete is \\"trying to keep his life exciting\\". Due to the desperation and unhappiness inherent in Pete Campbell's character as demonstrated in this episode, Weiner called it \\"probably the saddest episode we've ever had.\\" The fight scene, according to Jared Harris, was Lane discovering what Pete really thought of him. Harris saw the boxing match as \\"a mix of so many different styles\\" with Lane carrying an \\"old school and traditional\\" stance. Harris saw it as Lane getting a chance to \\"fight for his dignity\\". Reception =Ratings= \\"Signal 30\\" was watched by 2.69 million viewers and obtained a 1.0 adults 18-49 rating, a slight drop from the previous episode. =Critical reception= The episode opened to laudatory reviews from the television critic community, with much praise reserved for John Slattery's direction and the acting work of Vincent Kartheiser. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, her highest grade for the season so far, calling it \\"transfixing and incredible\\" and \\"season five's first instant classic\\". She praised the symbol of the dripping faucet as well as the editing choices that suggested \\"the way that time passes, so that it almost seems as if you‚Äôve lost yourself in the mists of your own life\\". Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, exalted Slattery's \\"strong command of the comedic moments\\", and recognized that \\"most of the carnage\\" of the episode \\"comes out of failed attempts by Pete, Lane and Ken to be more than they are by building bridges from one world to another.\\" Meredith Blake, reviewer for the Los Angeles Times, said that the episode was a sort of masculine companion piece to the fourth season episode \\"The Beautiful Girls\\", as \\"Signal 30\\" focuses on \\"collective identity crisis of the agency's male population\\". Paste magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg called Pete Campbell \\"one of the most complex, underrated characters on TV today\\" and called the dripping sink \\"more like a fucking geyser in reality, and if he doesn‚Äôt do something to plug it up soon, he‚Äôs going to drown.\\" Jordan Bartel of the Chicago Tribune called the episode \\"a classic\\" and saw a possible Emmy nomination for Vincent Kartheiser, but felt the kitchen sink symbolism and ending voiceover was a little heavyhanded.

At that time it was located on Marine Lines, which was the only access as Marine Drive was yet to be reclaimed. Until 1942, membership of the gymkhana was restricted to people of Hindu religion.

Hindu Gymkhana was responsible for fielding the Hindu XI in the Bombay Quadrangular and its successor Bombay Pentangular cricket tournaments. The gymkhana is one of the founder members of the Bombay Cricket Association. Hindu Gymkhana organises several tournaments such as Purshottam Shield Cricket Tournament, which is the oldest tournament started in 1912 that it organises. The Gymkhana has been identified as a Heritage Grade IIA structure.

He has made contributions to the study of medieval mysticism (especially Meister Eckhart), early medieval Welsh and Irish spirituality, and contemporary Systematic Theology. He presently works in the fields of neuroscience, theology (including Sino-theology) and social transformation. Davies is the originator together with Paul Janz and Clemens Sedmak of ‚ÄòTransformation Theology‚Äô.Transformation Theology. Church in the World, London, 2007 Since 2004 he has held the chair of Christian Doctrine at King's College London, as a Roman Catholic layman. He is founding director of the Centre for Social Transformation at King's College London, which specializes in the development of 'global' or 'ecumenical' understandings of the self in the light of comparative philosophy, traditional philosophies and new advances in the neurology of social cognition. Biography Oliver Davies was born in Bradford, United Kingdom, in 1956 but grew up in South Wales (his father was Eryl Davies). He attended Cardiff High School and then Merton College, Oxford (1975-9), where he studied German and Russian. He completed his doctoral work in the area of Religion and Literature, with a study of the German Jewish poet Paul Celan, at Wolfson College Oxford (1979‚Äì86). He met his wife Fiona Bowie at Wolfson and they married in 1981. From 1982-4 Davies lectured in English at the University of Cologne. His first publications were in the area of the medieval German mystical tradition, especially Meister Eckhart. From 1989 he taught Theology at University of Wales Bangor until his appointment as lecturer in Theology at University of Wales Lampeter in 1993 (Senior Lecturer from 1995 and Reader from 1997). Following the untimely death of Colin Gunton, Davies was appointed in 2004 to the Chair of Christian Doctrine at King's College London. From 2006‚Äì9, he served as Head of the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at King's. Davies was Visiting Professor in the Dept. of Religion, University of Virginia, in 2002‚Äì3, and held the McCarthy Visiting Professorship, Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome in 2006‚Äì7. Since 2011 he has been a regular visitor to Renmin University of China, where he works with Chinese colleagues, including the leading Chinese scholars Yang Huilin and Geng Youzhuang, on the development of a new 'ecumenical' theology reflecting Chinese culture and experience. Writings Davies‚Äô work combines an interest in language and communication, whether textual or oral, with questions of metaphysics, ethics and doctrine. His chief works to date are A Theology of Compassion, 2000, The Creativity of God, 2004, Transformation Theology, 2007 (with Paul Janz and Clemens Sedmak) and Theology of Transformation: Faith, Freedom and the Christian Act, 2013. His work can be characterized as a progression from metaphysics, to hermeneutics and finally to philosophies and theologies of the act. His work has furthered an emphasis on the centrality of ethics and the structure of the ethical self for Christian theology. In recent work Davies has also taken up the theme of the possibility of grounding global or 'ecumenical' accounts of the self in the proto-ethical structure of the self as identified in the contemporary neurobiology of human social cognition. He is currently writing a series of articles, published in English and Chinese, on the possibilities of new contemporary 'global' accounts of the self and on 'ecumenical' theologies, working together with colleagues from China, Europe and the UK.Oliver Davies, 'Religion, Politics and Ethics: Towards a Global Theory of Social Transformation', Frontiers of Philosophy in China, Volume 7, Issue 4, pp. 572-594, 2012.

He was sent to England to be trained by Fred Rimell at Kinnersley. The horse won the Aintree Grand National in 1961. At that time, Nicolaus Silver was only the second grey horse to win the Aintree Grand National since its first running in 1839. There was not another grey winner until Neptune Collonge won the race in 2012. Ridden by jockey Bobby Beasley Nicolaus Silver started at odds of 28/1 in a field of thirty-five runners for the 1961 National. He was among the leaders from early on the second circuit and drew clear over the last two fences to win by five lengths. It was Rimell's second National win having won the race in 1956 with ESB. Prior to the race, Nicolaus Silver had been the target of dopers. Nicolaus Silver completed the course in the next two Grand Nationals, finishing seventh in 1962 and tenth in 1963.

Description The systematics of the family Vesicomyidae is unclear because of the small number of specimens collected, the variability between specimens of the same species and their wide dispersal in isolated, deep water locations. The morphology of Calyptogena magnifica resembles another member of the genus, Calyptogena elongata, the type locality of which is several hundred miles further north. C elongata is only known from three small specimens and the size of mature individuals is unknown. The two valves of Calyptogena magnifica are oval or slightly kidney-shaped and about two times as long as they are high. The umbones are towards the anterior end of the valve and the growth rings are most noticeable near the margins. The shell material is thick and the exterior is white and usually chalky in appearance. The periostracum is yellowish brown, wrinkled and loose. The ligament is external and there are several U-shaped cardinal hinge teeth on each valve. The largest specimen so far collected has a valve length of . The mantle is an iridescent purplish pink and there is a large pink protrudible foot divided into two portions. The two separate siphons are short and do not extend beyond the edge of the valves. The pallial sinus is small. The gills are large and thick and the visceral mass is red due to the haemoglobin in the blood. Distribution Calyptogena magnifica was first described by Kenneth Boss and Ruth Turner of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, in 1980, following its discovery during research dives by the submersible vehicle DSV Alvin to the floor of the Pacific Ocean in 1977 and 1979. The location of the thermal vent where it was found was approximately west of Punta Mita, Mexico at a depth of . Further deep water exploration shows that it is present at other thermal vents on the East Pacific Rise between 21¬∞N and 22¬∞S as well as in the Galapagos Rift. In some locations it is plentiful while in other, apparently suitable habitats, it is not present at all.Deep-Sea Vent Clams Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Retrieved 2012-04-15. Biology Calyptogena magnifica is assumed to burrow and it is thought the divided foot may be specially adapted for insertion into cracks in hard substrates or among mussels (Bathymodiolus thermophilus). The animal can move around on the sea floor with its muscular foot and usually takes up a vertical position rather than lying flat. Calyptogena magnifica is specially adapted to life round hydrothermal vents by the chemosymbiotic bacteria it harbours in its gills which oxidize hydrogen sulfide seeping from the vents. The clam absorbs nutrients produced by these bacteria rather than photosynthetically derived products and no longer has guts.Hydrothermal vents Deep Ocean. Retrieved 2012-04-15. Little is known of the reproduction and life cycle of Calyptogena magnifica but examination of specimens brought up from the deep showed numerous large oocytes with yolks in various stages of development among the visceral mass. Researchers thought this might mean that the clam had poor dispersal abilities but a study using rDNA analysis showed that larvae did in fact disperse to other vents throughout its range. Hydrothermal vents emit hot, sulfur-rich water for several years and then cease to flow. This results in the death of the community surrounding them, and for the continuing existence of their species, there is a need for the larvae of these animals to have dispersed to other existing vents and for them to exploit new vents when they open up. Ecology Calyptogena magnifica was found near thermal vents in the deep sea floor where it was part of a rich benthic community. There were considerable numbers of empty shells and a few live individuals in the small area studied. The clams were lodged in crevices among a large number of mussels and some large galatheid crabs were observed walking over the bed of bivalves. Shrimps and octopuses were also observed in the vicinity.

Early history The Division was established in 1842. The G Division was purely investigative, consisted of plainclothes detectives and was unique to the DMP. 'Instead of having detectives attached to each division, as was the practice in London, the Dublin Police administration established one central office, or G Division, for the whole district at Exchange Court, Dublin Castle. A superintendent, two sergeants and 14 constables were assigned to the Detective Division. A certain number of constables were on duty day and night, while others were exclusively employed in connection with the pawnbrokers‚Äô offices. Special attention and continuous watch was kept on the networks of receivers of stolen goods.' By 1859 much of the G Division's work was concerned with Fenianism. Superintendent Daniel Ryan headed the detectives answering to Sir Henry Lake, chief commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP). Ryan had an informer named Pierce Nagle within the offices of the Fenian Irish People newspaper. In 1865 Nagle warned Ryan about an ‚Äúaction this year‚Äù message on its way to the Irish Republican Brotherhood unit in Tipperary. On 15 July 1865 Irish American plans for an IRB rising in Ireland were discovered when the emissary lost them at Kingstown railway station. Ryan raided the offices of the newspaper on 15 September and the staff were arrested.Christy Campbell, p.58-9 They were tried and sentenced to terms of penal servitude. In 1874 John Mallon succeeded Ryan as head of G Division. Mallon's father had been linked with the Ribbon Society but the son had specialised in his career working against Irish republicanism. He had an extensive knowledge of the separatists and operated a personal network of spies and informers. In the 1880s G Division was pitted against separatist insurgents including the Invincibles. It also operated against the Land League and even the Irish Parliamentary Party, arresting Charles Stewart Parnell in 1881. Mallon supervised G Division until his retirement in January 1902. To protect his informants, Mallon had refused to commit much of his knowledge to paper. During Irish War of Independence The unarmed and uniformed majority of the Dublin Metropolitan Police played a relatively neutral role during the troubles of 1919, restricting their functions to such traditional roles as criminal investigation and traffic control. However an expanded G Division was employed as an active intelligence agency against the IRA. In his book \\"The Spy in the Castle\\" David Neligan (an IRA double agent who infiltrated G Division) suggests that much of this activity was unprofessional, dependent upon casually recruited local spies and English officers whose wartime experience in Cairo and elsewhere had little relevance to Dublin conditions. Several DMP officers actively assisted the IRA during the Irish War of Independence (1919-21), most famously Edward Broy, who passed valuable intelligence to IRA leader Michael Collins throughout the conflict. Broy was a double agent with the rank of Detective Sergeant (DS) The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict between the IRA and British Intelligence by Tony Geraghty (), p.336 and worked as a clerk inside the G division branch. While there he copied sensitive files for Collins and passed many of these files on to him through Thomas Gay, the librarian at Capel Street Library. On 7 April 1919, Broy smuggled Collins into G Division's archives in Brunswick Street, enabling him to identify \\"G-Men\\", six of whom would be killed by the IRA.Cottrell, op. cit., p.53. *30 July 1919 ‚Äì the first assassination authorised by Collins was carried out when Detective Sergeant Patrick SmythShooting 'The Dog' by Sean Ryan in History Ireland (Vol 27-n¬∞4) pp 40-41 - july-august 2019, \\"the Dog\\", was shot near Drumcondra, Dublin.Mackay, James.

He composed music for more than half a dozen Hindi and about 25 Punjabi films.  Early life  Singh was born in 1928 to a Sikh family in Lahore in British Punjab. He was very fond of music since his childhood. During his school days he got his initial training in classical music from Sardar Avtar Singh of Lahore. Later joined popular music director Hansraj Behl as an assistant. = Personal life = He was in love with a Muslim girl and composed some tunes celebrating her femininity and charm. He left Lahore in 1947 but his beloved's mesmerising looks lingered in his thoughts and once admitted that he can't create good music without being in love.  Career  After partition, Kwatra family moved to Amritsar and then to Bombay. The first film of Kwatra Production was a Punjabi film, Posti (1950). The entire cast was refugee from Lahore. Sardul picked a young girl Shyama for the female lead. The music of the film was a hit and critically acclaimed. Sardul modified the folk tunes of Punjab and introduced Asha Bhosle and Jagjit Kaur as playback singers for Punjabi films, with Asha Bhosle making her debut. In 1953, another Kwatra Production, Kaude Shah with Shyama as heroine, became a blockbuster. Sardul also composed the music of another Punjabi film Vanjara, in which Lata Mangeshkar sang majority of songs. He also introduced Shaminder as a playback singer. he composed the music for another great Punjabi musical Billo in the later 1950s. He later composed music for some Hindi films from which, Goonj and Mirza Sahiban 1953 are among the hits. In the mid 1970s he moved to Chandigarh and established the Chandigarh Film Institute in sector 5. His last assignment was a Punjabi film, Unkhilli Muttiar 1983. He was in Bombay from 1975 with his eldest son. He was great friends with actor Pradeep Kumar. It was struggle, even then he found his way to do what he loved the most MUSIC and MOVIES.

At about the age 16, Scovel indicated to his parents his lack of interest in religious training and his intention to seek work as an engineer. However, later Scovel returned to Wooster University. Afterwards Henry Scovel attended the Michigan Military Academy, graduating in 1877 and enrolling at the University of Michigan in the fall. Halfway through his sophomore year, despite his excelling on the athletic field and performing well in the classroom, Scovel, restless, dropped out. From time to time he would send articles on conditions there to Cleveland newspapers. He also provided occasional articles about the club's activities to the Pittsburgh Dispatch. His imagination and sympathies stirred by the revolution taking place in Cuba, he headed to New York, where he made arrangements to work as a foreign correspondent for the Herald, a paper well-regarded for its reporting of international news. An editor promised Scovel $24 per dispatch for the information he could smuggle out about the Spanish‚ÄìCuban conflict.  War coverage  Sylvester Henry \\"Harry\\" Scovel was one of the most celebrated journalists of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Sylvester Scovel had never planned to become a yellow kid journalist or the celebrated correspondent covering the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War for Joseph Pulitzer's New York newspaper, The World. His dispatches from Cuba‚Äîabout Spanish atrocities before the war, the American war effort in Cuba, and especially those about the sinking of the Maine in Havana Harbor‚Äîgave him a national notoriety unexpected for a man not trained as a journalist but an engineer. Scovel landed in Cienfuegos on the southern coast. After some initial difficulties in eluding Spanish authorities as he tried to slip out of town, he headed to the backcountry in search of the army of General Maximo Gomez, the Cuban insurgent chief in the eastern provinces. Scovel arrived in November, \\"traveling with the commander's personal staff,\\" as the insurgents began their invasion of the western provinces. He sent his dispatches to New York through sympathetic Junta agents who smuggled them by boat to the U.S. But after three months, he had no idea if any of his work had made its way to the Herald. In an effort to locate American newspapers, early January 1896, while traveling with the rebel band of General Antonio Maceo, Scovel attempted to slip into Havana to check on his dispatches. In trying to pass through a sentry post as a 20-year-old Spanish speaking journalist, his bluff was called, and he was imprisoned in Havana's dreaded Morro Castle. Several days away from execution, he was visited by Dr. William Shaw Bowen, a correspondent for The New York World, who made a strong case to the Spanish authorities that they should not execute this college president's son. Scovel was released and directed to leave the country. But the young man had impressed the veteran political writer with his sincerity \\"to make a reputation as a war correspondent\\" that he was employed by The World. He traveled on horseback with a typewriter and refused to carry a weapon of any kind, for to do so, he believed, would compromise his noncombatant status. As quickly as Scovel became an ally valued by the Cubans, he was reviled by the Spanish for his reporting. Senor Sylvester was \\"the best known and most bitterly hated American in Cuba\\" (Bullard 410). The Worlds representative wrote numerous articles about the Spanish atrocities and had the information witnessed with signatures. He reported on Spanish and Cuban troop movements, their strengths and weaknesses and the devastating effects of the Spanish reconcentrado policy. On February 23, 1896, Scovel published an exclusive interview with Gomez that enraged General Valeriano Weyler, Spanish governor of Cuba, who responded by posting a reward of $5,000 (Milton 95) and then $10,000 for The World correspondent's capture. Nursing a six-month-old gunshot wound that he incurred while witnessing an exchange of fire between the insurgents and the Spanish, Scovel left the country in disguise in August (Milton 100). On January 2, 1897, Scovel slipped back into Havana, risking arrest \\"at times when the execution of a little band of captured revolutionists by a firing squad was one of the regular early morning spectacles\\" (\\"Sylvester Scovel,\\" February 13, 1905, 3). He met with American Consul-General Fitzhugh Lee, who wanted Scovel to locate Gomez and obtain the general's response to an American proposal for home rule in Cuba (Milton 143). Scovel accomplished his mission expeditiously. On January 4, he wrote, \\"I have been fortunate enough to get into Havana, get out of it again, and to find an insurgent force, all within twelve hours\\" (\\"Rebels Never More Hopeful,\\" January 7, 1897, 1). The Spanish authorities seethed. Scovel continued to elude capture until February 2, 1897, when he was arrested for a second time by Spanish officials, who claimed that the journalist had forfeited his American citizenship by assisting the insurgents. A great outcry ensued. Newspapers in 87 U.S. cities ran editorials calling for Scovel's release. Congress, 14 state legislatures, as well as the Oklahoma territory and the city council of Columbus, Ohio, adopted resolutions calling for immediate governmental intervention (World, February 17-March 9, 1897). Journalist Richard Harding Davis and illustrator Frederic Remington published letters in The World protesting Scovel's unjust imprisonment. Davis argued Scovel's status as a non-combatant and concluded by threatening that if Scovel were to perish in Spanish hands, \\"HIS DEATH WILL FREE CUBA\\" (\\"Richard Harding Davis Writes,\\" February 18, 1897, 1). Three days later, Remington called for greater State Department involvement and observed that \\"it must make [Scovel] sour on his country when he is abandoned this way\\" (\\"Fred Remington to The World,\\" February 21, 1897, 1). On March 9, he was released and traveled back to New York, now one of the most famous correspondents in the nation.

King William often resided at Lanark Castle, taking part in local hunts and watching racing on the moors. However, the various hallmarks on the bell, by members of the Incorporation of Goldsmiths in Edinburgh, date from the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

Msizi means 'helper' in Zulu. The charity, based in South London and originally named Mants'ase Children's Home UK, is registered with the UK Charity commissionCharity Commission, Msizi Africa account report 2015 and provides children in Lesotho with nutritious food. Msizi Africa actively supports and closely works with a number of local projects and collaborates with Letsema, a network of service providers working with orphans and vulnerable children in Lesotho.Letsema Since October 2015, Msizi Africa Lesotho has been registered as a Lesotho registered charitable organisation. History Lucy Caslon first heard about Mants'ase Children's Home, an orphanage in Lesotho, in news reports of Prince Harry's visit to the home.Prince Harry At the end of an extensive trip through Africa in 2006 she decided to work at the orphanage as a volunteer. During this time she recognized that while the children in the home were fed, the food was not optimal in terms of nutrition and healthiness especially taking into consideration that many of the 50 children living in the home suffered from HIV/AIDS infection and other health issues. She received financial help from family and friends back in the UK which allowed her to buy fruit, vegetables, meat and fish to complement the children's normal diet of maize meals and cabbage. Realizing the positive effects of this healthier nutrition on the children's wellbeing Lucy Caslon founded the Mants'ase Children's Home UK charity after she arrived back in London. It was first set up specifically to benefit the lives of the children at the Mants'ase orphanage. Later the charity was re-branded as Msizi Africa as the support was extended to children in South Africa and Zambia. Msizi Africa grew significantly after Lucy Caslon became one of eight winners of Vodafones 2008's World of Difference programme which allowed her to work full-time for her charity. Impressed by her success one of her corporate supporters decided to match Vodafone's scheme and continue to pay her salary for 2010 and 2011 enabling the charity in the following years to help to relieve the hardship of around thousand children in Africa, where the AIDS pandemic has left many without parents or an extended family. Besides providing food Msizi Africa also repairs the houses of children who live on their own to ensure safer living conditions for them. In 2008 the Cape Town charity Beautiful Gate had to care for additional several hundred mothers with babies and young children due to the xenophobic attacks aimed towards foreign nationals living in South Africa which erupted in May and June of that year. Msizi Africa donated funds to feed these families for several days. Msizi Africa has in the past also supported Umthombo, a non- profit organisation based in Durban, South Africa, by providing three meals a day for hundreds of homeless children in the city. Founder Lucy Caslon attended the Christ's Hospital school from 1992 to 1999 and started organising fundraising events as a student. After graduating from Royal Holloway, University of London in 2003 with a BA in History she worked in the charity sector for three years, first in the events team at Marie Curie Cancer Care and eighteen months later as corporate fundraiser with FSID. Lucy Caslon waiting to receive the Olympic flame (Photo: helejo) In 2006 she spent three months traveling East, Central and Southern Africa before volunteering for four months, from August to December, at the Mants'ase Children's Home. After her return to London in 2007 she founded a charity in order to raise money to continue the food improvement project she had started during her time in Lesotho. She spend her evenings and weekends to raise funds while working full-time for eighteen months as Team Secretary EMEA Hospitality for DTZ. Besides winning 2008 the World of Difference initiative of the Vodafone Foundation she was shortlisted for the Red and Cosmopolitan magazine 'Woman of the Year' awards in the same year. In 2011 Lucy Caslon was shortlisted for the Dods and Scottish Widows 'Women in Public Life Awards' in the category \\"Voluntary Sector Achiever of the Year\\". Lucy Caslon shares her experiences to help other prospective founders by giving talks like for the Royal Holloway Entrepreneurs or as speaker at the Institute of Fundraising's National Convention 2012 and by writing articles. She has also published video tutorials about setting up a charity with the 'KnowHow NonProfit StudyZone', which is part of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Caslon was selected to carry the Olympic Torch on 23 July 2012 in SuttonOfficial site of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games on Croydon Road (A232) from the junction with The Manor Way by the Wallington County Grammar School to the beginning of Acre Lane. In order to raise money for her charity she put her torch up for sale for an amount of ¬£40000.00 which is needed to feed the 50 orphans of Mants'ase Children's Home for one year.

In 2016 Msizi Africa Lesotho catered for 108 children in the villages Majapereng, Ha Mahase and Ha Thoriso but tries to raise money using the JustGiving crowd funding platformSaving Mpokho and her 70 friends from Lesotho's deadly drought to expand their support to further villages as a survey of 2000 homes by the Msizi Africa Lesotho team revealed severe food shortage due to the drought in the country. In early 2018 the charity supported 96 orphans in those three villages and aimed to launch another feeding programme in a fourth village. On 6. June 2018 Msizi Africa announced that it has started to support a fourth village, Ha Lekhoaba, in its feeding programme. End of 2018 the feeding programme was extended to a fifth village, Ha Sekoati, bringing the number of orphans supported by the programme to over 200. Msizi Africa also continues to support the children of the Mants'ase orphanage in Mohale's Hoek. =COVID-19 pandemic impact= During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic the charity has lost up to 80% of its income and the trustees announced that Msizi Africa has to reduce the number of villages supported by their feeding programme from five to three. The villages have been evaluated in order of their vulnerability taking into account the age of the children, the availability of food sources, prevalence of HIV and the presence of adult carers. The food programme in Majapareng has been stopped end of July 2020 and in Ha Mahase end of August 2020. =Milk Project= In order to allow Msizi Africa Lesotho to become self-sufficient and able to raise the income for the feeding programmes within the country by 2023, a pilot project was started in June 2020 with two cows and loaned land. The Milk Project will produce milk from a small herd of Jersey cows, giving the milk to the supported children and selling the surplus to raise money to buy food. The project is run by Msizi Africa Lesotho with the initial support of the charity in London. Previously supported projects =Mophato oa Mants'ase Children's Home= The Mants'ase Children's Home was started in 1979 as home for unwanted girls by Father Patrick M.

Msizi Africa supports the children's home by providing financial help to buy food, build housing and pay for staff salary. The orphanes lived in round houses (rondavels), a typical type of building in that region, which were in a state of disrepair and Msizi Africa funded the building of a new dormitory complete with ablution blocks. Since 2014 the orphanage receives their food support from local organisations inside Lesotho.Thank you so much Msizi Africa Lucy Caslon was from 2010 until 2013 a member of the Board of Trustees of Mants'ase Children's Home and was its temporary manager for a short while in 2011.The Mophato oa Mants'ase Society - 2013 BoardThe Mophato oa Mants'ase Society - 2014 Board =iZulu Orphan Projects= In 2000 Chadd Bain returned to his native KwaZulu-Natal from the UK and started with two Zulu friends to educate and feed poor people in the rural area he had grown up in. He became involved with an orphanage called 'Nkosnathi' which he supported. In 2002 he met his later wife Kate and they started iZulu Orphan Projects (IOP), a non profit organisation which deals with orphans and widows affected by HIV and AIDS. From originally 80 orphans attending the 'Annual Orphan Christmas party', IOP supports now over 1600 children.iZulu Orphan Projects After Chadd Bain's tragic death in a motorcycle accident in December 2009 the project was in danger of failing and Msizi Africa pledged to feed 250 of the children and became Kate Bains biggest supporter enabling her to continue with the charity. Lucy Caslon climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in September 2010 in order to raise money for that project. =Peace Matunda School and Orphanage= Msizi Africa helped to fund the feeding programme of the Peace Matunda project founded in 2005 by Unambwe Zephania Kaaya. It consists of an orphanage with 24 children and a school and Kindergarten with over 200 pupils located in the rainforest of Mount Meru in Northern Tanzania, about 15 km from the city of Arusha. =Testimony and Majapereng feeding programmes= Msizi Africa provided food to couples in villages surrounding the Mants'ase Children's Home who cook for local orphans and distribute food parcels. This project supports 160 children not only with food but also with school uniforms and medical care. The Testimony Feeding Programme (covering Ha Potsane, Qalakheng and Kubake) and the Majapereng Feeding Programme were located in nearby villages in the Mohale's Hoek district. 250px =The 28 Fund= The 28 Fund was a campaign started by Msizi Africa in 2011 which aims to gain donation by direct debit accounts set up by supporters for 28 pence (or multiples of that amount) as it costs Msizi Africa 28 pence to feed one child for a day.

In 1451, William transferred his claim on the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg to Ernest and received Ernest's third of Opava in return. Thus, William owned a two-thirds share of Opava.Pavel Sedl√°ƒçek: Vztahy mezi Kladskem a Franken≈°teijnskem ve 14. a 15. stoleti, in: Kladsk√Ω Sborn√≠k, vol. 2, 1998, p. 119 However, William died the following year and Ernest, acting as guardian for William's underage sons, sold this share to Duke Bolko V of Opole.

The building depicted here replaces an earlier chapel, constructed in 1893 but destroyed in 1798 in the French invasion of Switzerland. The 1672 building may in turn have built on the site of an older chapel. Odermatt, St. Magnus- oder Winkelriedskapelle auf Allweg in Nidwalden, Geschichtsfreund d. V Orte, 1887, p. 42. Heinrich von Winkelried (d. after 1303), known as Schrutan or Strut \\"the giant\\", was a medieval knight in what is now Central Switzerland. As Strut von Winkelried he became the subject of a legend which makes him the slayer of a dragon. The legendary Strut is placed a generation before the historical character, with a flouruit in the 1240s, and his death due to poisoning by dragon-blood recorded for 1250. Historical character Heinrich von Winkelried, genannt Schrutan is recorded in a document dated 22 April 1275.J.E.Kopp: Geschichtsbl√§tter aus der Schweiz, Herausgegeben von J.E. Kopp, Band 2, Seite 200, 5. Beilage III a After this date and until 1303, his name figures repeatedly as that of a witness on official documents. Nothing beyond this is known about his life. The Winkelried family is well attested in 13th and 14th century, the first known member being the knight Rudolf von Winkelried, attested 1248 as a follower of Frederick II. Heinrich therefore may have been a son of Rudolf's. The home castle of the Winkelried may have been at Ennetmoos near Stans. The modern municipality of Ennetmoos has chosen dragon for its coat of arms due to the legend of Schrutan. The nickname Schrutan (also Strutan, Struthan, Struth, etc.) is derived from German legend, where it is given to a giant, in particular one of the guardians of the Rosengarten in Heldenbuch literature, but it also occurs as the name of a knight at Etzel's court in the Nibelungenlied (v. 1880). Why the historical knight was given this nickname is not known, but it was not uncommon at the time for members of the knightly classes of the Holy Roman Empire to adopt pseudonyms taken from heroic fiction. Heinrich's sons would have been Rudolf and Walther von Winkelried, both d. c. 1325. Hermann von Liebenau further assumes that one Heinrich genannt Schrutan who was buried with his wife Mechthild in Colmar, Alsace must be identical with the knight,Hermann von Liebenau, Arnold Winkelried, seine Zeit und seine That: ein historisches Bild nach neuesten Forschungen, 1862, p. 25. who therefore would have left Switzerland at some point after 1303, but Oechsli (1898) does not accept the identity and ascribes the equality in name to coincidence.  Legend  Schrutan's fight with the dragon, by Karl Jauslin (1842-1904) The legend is first mentioned by Etterlin (1507), without the given name Strut and without a fixed year (but placed \\"before the time of king Rudolf). It is expanded into greater detail in the Chronicon Helveticum by Aegidius Tschudi (d. 1570), compiled in the 16th century and first printed in 1734. Tschudi now fixes the year of the event as 1250 and specifies the identity of the hero as one Struth von Winkelriedt (which name he emphasizes is recorded in the annals of Stans), who had been knighted by emperor Frederick at the battle of Favenz (1239). The legend was later included by the Brothers Grimm in their collection of German legends (Deutsche Sagen 1865, no. 218). According to the story as reported by Tschudi, a dragon lived in a cave near Stans (the Drachenloch near the top of Mueterschwandenberg), destroying cattle and causing much damage to the people of Wilen, to the point where the village had to be abandoned and came to be known as √ñdwilen (deserted Wilen). The people of Unterwalden made several expeditions trying to kill the dragon with crossbows, but each time the dragon saw he was at a disadvantage, he quickly retired into his cave or ran up a steep slope like a lizard, where he was unreachable. At this point, Winkelried, who had been banished from Unterwalden for manslaughter, asked whether he would be allowed back into the land if he would kill the dragon. This was accepted, and Struth attacked the dragon single-handedly, armed with a spear, to the point of which he had attached sharp barbs. The dragon seeing that the attacker was alone came from his hiding-place and attacked with open jaws, and Winkelried was able to transfix the monster with his spear, hacking at it with his sword until it died. Glad for his victory, Winkelried lifted his sword over his head, thanking God, and the dragon's blood dripped from his sword blade on his body, poisoning him so that he died a few days later. Toponymy referring to a dragon is found in Ennetmoos, where the historical Winkelried family originated. A Drachenried (dragon's fen) and Drachenloch (dragon's cave) are to the west of the village, and a Drachenkapelle (dragon chapel), also known as Winkelriedkapelle dedicated to Struth is south of the village, next to Wychried, the probable site of the original Winkelried estate. The story is probably a recontextualisation of a much older dragon myth, put into a new historical context in late medieval folklore. The \\"dragon\\" toponymy in this place has been associated with the older dragon narrative in the Nibelung cycle in 19th-century scholarship.

Both Grieg and the Austro-Hungarian conductor Anton Seidl had a hand in the orchestration. It consists of three pieces revised by Grieg from Seidl's arrangements, and one piece arranged by Grieg alone. History Grieg wrote the six Lyric Pieces of Book V for piano in 1891. The original order was: * 1. Shepherd Boy (Gj√¶tergut) * 2. Norwegian March (Gangar) * 3. March of the Dwarfs (Troldtog) * 4. Notturno * 5. Scherzo * 6. Bell-Ringing (Klokkeklang). In 1894, Anton Seidl, the conductor of the New York Philharmonic, orchestrated four of the pieces for his orchestra to play. He gave the work the title of Norwegian Suite. The four pieces he chose were: * 2. Norwegian March * 3. March of the Dwarfs * 4. Notturno * 6. Bell- Ringing. Seidl died in 1898. In 1905, with the assistance of Daniela Thode (1860-1940; the daughter of Cosima Wagner by her first husband Hans von B√ºlow, and the grand-daughter of Franz Liszt), Grieg obtained the score of Seidl's arrangement but was dissatisfied with it in some respects. He wrote to Seidl's widow, saying that, while her late husband's work had considerable merit, it did not fully accord with his own conception of the pieces, and he had therefore revised Seidl's orchestrations.NaxosClassical Archives Seidl had worked alongside Richard Wagner for a number of years, making the first copy of the score of Der Ring des Nibelungen, and conducting the Ring Cycle many times in Germany and America. He was undoubtedly influenced by Wagner's heavy Germanic instrumentation, which did not fit well with Grieg's lighter, more subtle and folkloristic approach. Structure Grieg gave his revised arrangement the title of Lyric Suite. Although he did complete his revision of Seidl's arrangement of No. 6 Bell-Ringing, he chose not to include it. Instead, he orchestrated the first piece, Shepherd Boy, directly from the original piano score, and included it in the suite. The other three pieces were set for full orchestra, but Shepherd Boy was arranged for strings alone. Grieg slightly altered the order of the numbers in the orchestral suite by swapping No. 4 Notturno with No. 3 March of the Dwarfs. The final order is: * 1. Shepherd Boy * 2. Norwegian March * 3. Notturno (originally No. 4) * 4. March of the Dwarfs (originally No. 3). He conducted the Lyric Suite a number of times in the two remaining years of his life, and it has been recorded and performed many times by other conductors. Seidl's Norwegian Suite has not survived in the repertoire. The score is now part of the Seidl Collection at Columbia University Library. Other arrangements of Lyric Pieces In 1899, Grieg orchestrated two of the pieces from Book IX, Op. 68. * No. 4 Evening in the Mountains was set for oboe, horns and strings. * No. 5 At the Cradle was set for strings alone.

The troop was founded by United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Marvin Howard in 1954 and was active for about 10 years. They rode the feral Banker horses of North Carolina's Outer Banks. These horses were descended from horses that had either survived shipwrecks or early explorations from the 1500s‚Äì1700s along the Outer Banks. Though the ponies roamed free, they were considered livestock. In 1953, when the Cape Hatteras National Seashore was created, the Park Service banned free roaming livestock on the island. Efforts have been made to preserve the horses and improve their bloodline. History =Horses= Ocracoke Island The Banker horses were primarily descended from Spanish horses that had either survived shipwrecks or early explorations from the 1500s‚Äì1700s along the Outer Banks. The first horses on Ocracoke may have been from Sir Richard Grenville's ship, Tiger, which ran aground on Ocracoke in 1565. Solid documentation of the ponies on Ocracoke goes back to the 1730s. The Ocracoke ponies are different from other ponies in that they possess five instead of six lumbar vertebrae and 17 instead of 18 ribs. They also differ from standard horses in shape, color, size, posture, and weight. Historically, though the ponies roamed free, they were owned by various members of the community and hence were considered livestock. This began to change in 1953 when the Cape Hatteras National Seashore was created and the Park Service banned free roaming livestock on the island. =Troop= The troop was founded by Army Lieutenant Colonel Marvin Howard, who had started his military career with the Navy in World War II before switching to the United States Army Corps of Engineers. This troop is the only mounted troop in the history of the BSA. In summer 1954, ten horses were taken from the Ocracoke herd as a project for Boy Scout Troop 290; and almost every age-eligible boy on the island joined the troop. The Scouts had to catch, tame, train, and teach the ponies to eat hay rather than native feed. Individual Scouts worked part-time to own their own pony, equipment, and horse feed. The horses, which were comfortable in the water, proved difficult to catch. The horses were taught to respond to \\"port\\" and \\"starboard\\" instead of \\"gee\\" and \\"haw\\". The Bankers were ridden in parades, especially on July 4, and used as mounts during programs to spray mosquito-ridden salt marshes. The troop made regular trips to the region's Pirates Jamboree and horse races in Buxton, North Carolina, as well as troop horseback hunting and camping trips. Sand dunes of Ocracoke In 1959 the North Carolina legislature and the National Park Service ordered the ponies removed from all the Outer Banks islands because of overgrazing. However, the legislature and Park Service were persuaded to make an exception for the Scouts' ponies as long as they were penned and taught to eat hay. In the 1960s the National Park Service also began taking care of a small herd kept on at the northern end of the island in pasture known as the Ocracoke Pony Pens. Then the BSA demanded that the Scouts buy insurance to continue riding the ponies, which they could not afford, and the troop folded about 10 years after it was formed. The pony pasture also became too expensive. When Troop 290 became defunct there were few ponies left. The Park Service took control of the ponies in the late 1960s. =Preservation= In 1973 Park Ranger Jim Henning and his wife Jeannette began efforts to save some of the horses at the north end of the island. The Ocracoke herd showed definite signs of an inadequate gene pool by the 1980s when in 1988 Susan Bratton of the Park Service recommended replenishing the herd's gene pool with other Banker horses. The herd shows genetic similarities to Standardbred horses. Park Ranger Kenny Ballance had been the district ranger for 30 years when, on February 2, 2012, he brought Alonso, a two-year-old registered Spanish stallion with proven DNA links to the Ocracoke herd, from the Corolla Wild Horse herd of Corolla, North Carolina, to the Ocracoke herd to join 16 other horses to replenish their gene pool. This herd has respiratory and other problems believed to be caused by inbreeding. Alonso is believed to be the only healthy stallion that can continue the Ocracokes' blood line‚Äîand he has only one testicle with which to do it. It took Ballance three years to find a suitable stallion.

Life Fran√ßois de Bonne, first duc de Lesdigui√®res (1543-1626) Charles de Cr√©quy, ca 1575 to 17 March 1638, was the only child of Antoine de Blanchefort (ca 1545-1575), and Chr√©tienne d‚ÄôAguerre (1556-1611), Lady-in-waiting or dame d‚Äôhonneur to Louise de Lorraine. The de Cr√©quy family were distributed throughout Northern France, with branches at Fressin, Bernieulles, Auffay and Heilly. They originated from Cr√©quy, in Artois, which formed part of the French-speaking Southern Spanish Netherlands until annexed by France in 1659. Charles' father Antoine de Blanchefort inherited his titles and lands from his uncle, another Antoine (1531-1574), Roman Catholic Bishop of Amiens and advisor to Charles IX. This background is significant in understanding their importance; Catholic loyalists from a disputed border province, in a period when France was divided by the Wars of Religion and threatened by the Spanish Empire, then the dominant power in Europe. Charles later married into the Lesdigui√®res family, Huguenots from the Dauphin√©, which was then another border province. In 1595, he married Madeleine de Bonne (1576-1621), daughter of Fran√ßois de Bonne, duc de Lesdigui√®res (1543-1626); they had four children, Fran√ßoise (1596-1656), Charles (1598-1630), Fran√ßois (1600‚Äì1677) and Madeleine (1609-1676). After his first wife's death in 1621, Charles married her half- sister Fran√ßoise de Bonne (1604-1647), ensuring his succession as duc de Lesdigui√®res when his father-in-law died in 1626. Pattou, Etienne p.14 Career During the second half of the 16th century, France was divided by the 1562-1598 French Wars of Religion; in 1589, the Huguenot leader Henry of Navarre converted to Catholicism and was crowned Henry IV of France. The 1590 Edict of Nantes ended this phase of the civil war, although the Catholic League fought on for several years; Charles first saw action as a volunteer at the recapture of Laon by Henry in August 1594. The long-running contest with Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs led to French involvement in the 1568-1648 Dutch Revolt and peripheral engagements of the 1618-48 Thirty Years War. During the 1627-1630 War of the Mantuan Succession, Charles' eldest son and namesake died in 1630 at Chamb√©ry, the capital of Savoy and he himself was killed in 1638 at Breme in Lombardy. Charles' younger son, Fran√ßois de Bonne de Cr√©qui, who succeeded him as duc de Lesdigui√®res and Governor of the Dauphin√© Charles served under his father-in-law, the duc de Lesdigui√®res, in the 1600-1601 Franco-Savoyard War and was appointed Colonel of the Gardes Fran√ßaises in 1605. When Henry IV was assassinated in 1610, his son Louis XIII was only nine years old and his mother, Marie de Medici became Regent. Her concern at having the Protestant Lesdigui√®res as Governor of the Dauphin√© led to his replacement in 1612 by Charles. France regularly became involved in Italian disputes given its proximity to the Duchy of Savoy, which then included the modern French territories of Villefranche and the County of Savoy. In addition, control of Northern Italy allowed the Habsburgs to threaten the French provinces of Languedoc and the Dauphin√© and control supply routes over the Alpine passes. The capture of the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle in 1628 released French forces for the relief of Casale Monferrato, then besieged by a Habsburg army during the War of the Mantuan Succession.

The Ese Kapƒ± Mescidi is located at the corner between the Walls of Constantine and the southern branch of the Mese, in the southwestern part of the city Ese Kapi Mosque (, where mescit is the Turkish word for a small mosque), also \\"Isa Kapi Mosque\\", meaning in English \\"Mosque of the Gate of Jesus\\", is an Ottoman mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. The building was originally a Byzantine Eastern Orthodox church of unknown dedication.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 118. Location The mosque lies in the Fatih district of Istanbul, in the neighborhood () of Davutpa≈üa, about 500 meters east-northeast of the Sancaktar Hayrettin Mosque, another Byzantine building. The edifice is now enclosed in the complex of Cerrahpa≈üa University Hospital. History =Byzantine Age= The origin of this Byzantine building, which lies on the southern slope of the seventh hill of Constantinople in the neighborhood named ta Dalmatou and overlooks the Sea of Marmara, is not certain. It was erected along the south branch of the Mese road, just inside the now disappeared Wall of Constantine (dating to the foundation of Constantinople by Constantine the Great) in correspondence of an ancient gate, possibly the Gate of Exaki√≥nios () or the Gate of Saturninus (, the city's original Golden Gate). The comparison of the brickwork with those of the Pammakaristos and Chora churches suggests that the building was erected between the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century, in the Palaiologan era. The proposed identification with the Monastery of Iasit√©s (), which lay in the neighborhood, remains uncertain.Janin (1953) p.264 =Ottoman and modern Age= The mosque in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' Byzantine topographical studies After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, in 1509 the Gate which gave the Turkish name to the building, (\\"Isa Kapi\\", gate of Jesus) was destroyed by an earthquake. Between 1551 and 1560 Vizier Hadim Ibrahim Pasha (d. 1562/63) ‚Äì who endowed also in the nearby neighborhood of the Gate of Silivri () a Friday mosque bearing his name ‚Äì converted the building into a small mosque (). At the same time he let Court Architect Mimar Sinan (who also designed the Friday Mosque) enlarge the existing complex. Sinan built a Medrese (Koranic school) and a Dershane (elementary school) connecting them to the ancient church.Necipoƒùlu (2005), p.392Eyice (1955), p.90 The location of these religious establishments in sparsely settled neighborhoods along the city's Theodosian Walls, where the population was predominantly Christian, shows the Vizier's desire of pursuing a policy of islamization of the city. During the seventeenth century the complex was damaged several times by earthquakes, and restored in 1648.M√ºller- Wiener (1977), p. 119. In 1741 Ahmet Agha ‚Äì another chief eunuch (Ibrahim Pasha in the charter of his waqf had designated the current chief white eunuch of the Imperial Harem as administrator () Boyar & Fleet (2010), p. 146 of the endowment) ‚Äì sponsored the construction of a small fountain ().Eyice (1955), p.90 The 1894 Istanbul earthquake ruined the building (only two walls withstood the quake), which was then abandoned. The ruins are now enclosed in the garden of Cerrahpa≈üa Hospital, seat of the Faculty of Medicine of Istanbul University. In recent years the building was surveyed and scanned and has been reconstructed according to its original shape and functions now again as a Mosque. Description The edifice has a rectangular plan with sides of 17.0 m and 6.80 m, and has one nave which ends towards East with a Bema and a three apses.Mamboury (1953) p.302 The central apse was demolished during the Ottoman period and replaced with a wall. The edifice's brickworkconsist of courses of rows of white stones alternating with rows of red bricks, obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. The external side of a surviving wall is divided with Lesenes surmounted by arches. Most likely the church was originally surmounted by a dome, but in the nineteenth century this had already been replaced with a wooden roof. The church interior was adorned with frescoes of the Palaiologan Age. Two of them ‚Äì painted in the south apse ‚Äì one depicting respectively the Archangel Michael (on the Conch) and the St. Hypatius (on the side wall), were still visible in 1930, but now have disappeared. On the two walls still standing are still visible decorations in stucco. Two sides of the court are occupied by a medrese () with eleven Cells to lodge the students () and a dershane (). The tight space constraints (the complex was encroached by several roads) forced Sinan to adopt a plan which strongly diverts from the standard solution for a complex of this kind. The brickwork of the medrese adopts a bichromatic pattern similar to that used in the church. The dershane is decorated with a frieze made of stucco arabesques in relief. The entrance of the court is adorned with a small Sebil.

Origins Originally, the Ojibwe lived further eastwards in the Great Lakes region. Their history is tied to the Seven fires prophecy which brought them to the Montana region and beyond, from 1000 to 1500 years ago. The Chippewas followed the prophecy and migrated west. The second stopping place may have been Niagara Falls, but they named the location \\"Great Falls,\\" which may be Git-chi Ka-bay-cone in the Chippewa language. Another theory proposes that the stopping place was Great Falls, Montana. =The People of the Falls= According to William W. Warren, the Dakota people named the Chippewa the \\"People of the Falls\\" (in Dakota Ra-ra-to-oans), not the French. Supposedly the name refers to the falls in the Sault Ste. Marie region of Michigan and Ontario. However, the Dakota may have been referring to the Great Falls of the Missouri. Once the first Chippewa settlers reached the Great Falls region, they could not ignore the five waterfalls which make up the Great Falls of the Missouri River, and also Giant Springs which is the largest freshwater spring in the United States. At one time a lake was located a few miles north of Great Falls which is known as Black Horse Lake. To the northwest of Black Horse Lake is Benton Lake. Historians claim the United States wanted to use Benton Lake for irrigation for nearby farms and in the late 19th century commenced to dig canals for that purpose. The one remaining canal in Benton Lake leads directly to what is left of Black Horse Lake, which is now just an indention in the land. Within Black Horse Lake was a possible island which is turtle shaped. It is one of the many buttes in the Great Falls region. It is around 200 feet higher than the elevation below Black Horse Lake. Non-treaty Chippewa leaders who refused to recognize treaties with the United States brought about the problem of landless Chippewas in Montana. Among the defiant Chippewa leaders of Montana who refused to sign the treaties were Chiefs Ahontoay, Big Bear, Little Bear, Little Shell III, and Lucky Man. As a result, the United States refused to recognize them and forced them off of reservation rolls, as well as claiming that they held no jurisdiction over them. Unlike the defiant Chippewa leaders, Chippewa leaders like Chief Rocky Boy and Chief Buffalo Coat were willing to accept treaties. Chief Rocky Boy who became friends with the United States. Chief Buffalo Coat attempted to negotiate a treaty in 1898 but the United States claimed to have no jurisdiction to reach an agreement. Present day The Chippewa in Montana live on these reservations: * Blackfeet Reservation :In the early 1990s, the population of Browning, Montana was around 15% Chippewa, which may indicate the percentage of the Indian population on the Blackfeet Reservation. The Indian population between those two Blackfeet settlements is almost entirely Chippewa. Around 1500 or more Chippewa presently live here. * Crow Reservation and Northern Cheyenne Reservation :It is difficult to ascertain the Chippewa population here due to the presence of the Muskegoes (who are called Swampy Cree, but according to Warren, these Muskegoes are the northernmost Chippewas, as Mushkegowuk means \\"Swampy People\\" in the Chippewa language). Historical records from around 1900 tell of at least 40 lodges of Muskegoes living here. With an average number of six people living in each lodge, the Chippewa population here would have been around 240. The population in 1900 was around 2000, which would put the Chippewa population at over 10%. * Flathead Reservation :A Chippewa population has always lived here. This includes the Muskegoes. A historical population record of the Muskegoes from around 1896 put their population at around 250 or 40 lodges. That does not include the other Chippewa. Around 1900, the Indian population here was just under 2000. Chippewa may make up 20% or more of the Indian population. However, only around 200 still maintain their Chippewa identity now. * Fort Belknap Reservation :The number of Chippewa clinging to their tribal identity here is large. * Fort Peck Reservation :This reservation has a large Chippewa population. * Rocky Boy Reservation :This is the only official Chippewa reservation in Montana. However, the United States claims that the Cree and M√©tis make up 90% of population.

Little is known of his childhood and education, however his early education probably took place at his family home in the Khari Baoli area of Delhi. He studied at the Anglo- Sanskrit Victoria Jubilee High-School. As a young businessman he went into the chemical industry manufacturing and trading in dyes and chemicals. He started a trading company - Amba Prasad Jadavjee & Co.. He was a pioneer in early advertising and introduced colorful and graphic labels for his products. He later sold the rights to these labels and trademarks to companies like Ciba and Bayer. =Philanthropy= His father founded the Delhi Pinjrapole Society at Kishanganj in Delhi to take in and look after abandoned and old cows. Amba Prasad took over the reins after him and expanded the lands owned by the gaushala by hundreds of acres. The society still exists but is not under family control. He also served as the Municipal Commissioner of Delhi and as an Honorary Magistrate. In 1916 his old school needed to expand so he contributed Rs 80,000 and built a new school building at Daryaganj; the building is known as Amba Prasad Vidyalay, and is now a registered heritage structure. In 1922, he was one of the founder members of the Roshanara Club, which had the first cricket field in Delhi at Roshanara Bagh. He was one of the few non-royal Indians invited to attend the Delhi Durbar to commemorate the coronation of King George V in 1911. For the trading community he founded the Kirana Committee of Delhi, one of the oldest trader associations in India. Being very religious, he built several temples and dharamshalas in Delhi, Vrindavan and Mathura, among other places. He also developed several ghats for religious ceremonies and bathing on the banks of the Yamuna river, in Delhi. These, however, have been swallowed by the Ring Road, as the Yamuna flows further away now. He was also one of the founders of the Hindu College in Delhi. He died in 1950, aged approximately 90 years. Family He was succeeded by his son, Rai Sahib Lala Shiv Shanker Lall (1908‚Äì1996), who carried on his charity and social work in old Delhi.

Plot Five friends, Ale (Fathir Mochtar), Jarot (Vino G. Bastian), Lukman (Dion Wiyoko), Sadat (Ali Syakieb), and Jago (Dallas Pratama) live in a slum. They look for trouble, fight, and extort tradesmen. With more leadership skills, Ale becomes the group's leader. He lives with his mother (Ully Artha), his little sister Aisyah (Fanny Fabriana), and little brother Bara (Agung Surya Putra). In the slum, there is a mute, Fathir (Reza Pahlevi), who lives with his grandmother. He is always mocked by the residents, including Ale, Lukman, Sadat, and Jago; however, Jarot often shows empathy to Fathir. One day, there is a football match between Ale's group and a rival group. After the match, a fight breaks out. One of the rival member plans to stab Ale. However, Jarot manages to foil it by hitting the attacker's head with a stone, killing him. Jarot is arrested. Ale's group, Jarot's parents, and his little sister Yani (Zaneta Georgina) are shocked. Ale's group still do their routines. Fathir wants to be a group member, but is rejected. Returning home, he sees his grandmother is dead; he then leaves the slum. Meanwhile, in prison, Jarot is tortured by other inmates. During visiting hours, he is jealous of the other inmates, who are visited by their relatives. He misses his friends. After that, he fights back against the other inmates who disturb him. When released, Jarot meets Fathir. Fathir brings him to headquarter of a drug gang, Naga Hitam (Black Dragon). Jarot is offered membership by their leader (George Rudy), which he accepts. Jarot and Fathir are assigned to protect drug distribution in his home slum. They have to deal with Ale's group. Jarot then comes back home to see his family and Aisyah. He expresses his love to her. Later, Lukman's little brother overdoses. In revenge, Lukman plans to kill Jarot, but he is shot by Fathir. Sadat and Jago are furious, and plan to rape Yani in return; Jarot, enraged, tortures them to death. Ale learns that Aisyah is in love with Jarot. He locks her in her room. However, Aisyah manages to escape and meets Jarot on a rooftop in order to ask him to stay with her; Jarot refuses. After the meeting, Aisyah is pushed from the roof by Fathir and dies immediately. Jarot assumes she killed herself, while Ale suspects Jarot. Jarot calls Ale to meet him. They fight, and Ale takes out his pistol. As they continue to struggle, a gunshot is heard; Ale drops dead. As he walks away, Jarot is shot twice by Fathir. The film closes with a scene which shows Bara taking Ale's pistol and leaving the slum with his friends to take revenge. Production Serigala Terakhir was directed by Upi Avianto, who had previously worked horror, teen dramas, and chick flicks. It was produced by Investasi Film Indonesia. Avianto said that her inspiration to write the story was the social conditions faced by Indonesian people, namely the threat of crime, and that she was most comfortable producing male-oriented films. The film was budgeted about Rp 8 billion, but special effects caused the costs to swell to Rp 10 billion. One of the locations used was Sukamiskin Penitentiary in Bandung, West Java, which helped show the hard life faced by inmates. Themes Serigala Terakhir tells about a broken friendship and a vengeance based in a traditional slum. It is based on the style of East Asian action films. Release and reception Serigala Terakhir was released on 5 November 2009. Elang Riki Yanuar, reviewing for Okezone, wrote that audiovisual effects were not good, especially in the fire scene. However, he praised the acting. Marcel Thee of Jakarta Globe noted that the film worked because of the focus \\"on the emotional evolution of its characters\\", and that while \\"production is well done for a local movie\\", there were nevertheless some \\"awkward visuals\\", such as the drug gang's \\"retro 1970s wardrobe\\" and \\"kitschy kung-fu imagery\\". At the 2009 Indonesian Film Festival, Serigala Terakhir was nominated for Best Artistic Arrangement, Best Sound Arrangement, and Best Cinematography, and Best Leading Actor, but the film did not win any. Bastian and Pahlevi received two awards at the 2010 Indonesian Movie Awards for Best Pair and Favorite Pair.

Bawm language is fairly developed and contains a good amount of literature including dictionaries, religious texts, historical texts, folk stories and books such as short stories and science fiction. However, the Bawm language is at risk for endangerment. One way in which the language can prosper is through the use of multilingual education programs to ensure that the Bawm community as a whole has sufficient resources to pass the language to the next generation. The use of multilingual education programs requires the community to be educated in what types of books and literature to use.Kim, Roy & Sangma. 2011.

Their sculptural art objects show the many influences of pop art, conceptual art, illusionism, naturalism and modern design. History Gufram was born in 1966 as a brand of the creative lab for modern furniture production of the Fratelli Gugliermetto, active seat and chairs makers since 1952, in Grosso, Torino. Influenced in the early '60s avant-garde artistic culture in Torino and the radical architectural experimentation of those years, the Gugliermetto brothers began to study with the support of emerging artists and architects of the time new forms and new materials to use in the production of design projects. The usage of polyurethane as insulating material in the transportation industry around 1970, and the definition of the system of cold pressing of it, allowed Gufram to start producing durable seating revolutionary aesthetics, which tightens the eye to Pop Art, structured padded with polyurethane foam. Since 1965, Gufram follows the artistic direction of Giuseppe Raimondi (designer), who signs for different products, and helps the company to involve other artists and architects in the design, and planning of the early products and prototypes of the company. In 1968, Gufram presents its products under the name of Multipli (industrially reproduced art objects in limited edition) in the XIV Triennale in Milan, enjoying a considerable success with the public and press that encouraged the company to go further with their philosophy and production method explored up to that moment. International consecration takes place in 1972, with an exhibition dedicated to Italian design entitled \\"Italy: The New Domestic landscape\\" curated by Emilio Ambasz staged at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York, where they are first exposed, and subsequently acquired different Multipli for the museum's permanent collection. From that moment on, Gufram products officially entered into the history of design and in the main collection of recognized European and American museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York, the Vitra Design Museum, the permanent collection the Triennale of Milan, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Art Museum of Denver in the USA. Over 30 years, Gufram implements its catalog of products with new collaborations while maintaining its headquarters in Piedmont until 2005, when the property is sold to the Poltrona Frau Group, which manages the brand until the end of 2011. Since the last months of 2011, after being purchased by entrepreneurs in the sector who wish to contribute to the revitalization of a historic brand of Italian design, the brand returns to Piedmont, settling in the new headquarters of Barolo, Piedmont.

Demographics  There are about a dozen ethnic groups in Afghanistan, they include: Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and others who make up less than 2% each. The most recent figures on the ethnic affiliations comes from a survey conducted by the Asia Foundation in 2014. According to the representative survey, 40% of the people identified themselves as Pashtun, 36% as Tajik, 10% as Hazara, 8% as Uzbek, 2% as Turkmen, 1% as Baloch, 1% as Nuristani, 1% as Aimaq, 1% as Arab, 1% as Pashaye, 1% as Sadat, 0.5% as Qizilbash, and 0.5% as Safi.  Taliban rule  After the Taliban rose to power in the mid 1990s, they began committing atrocities against their opponents, the Shias, Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks. In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's World Food Program to 160,000 hungry and starving people (most of whom were Hazaras and Tajiks) \\"for political and military reasons\\".http://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p;_multi=APAB&d;_place=APAB&p;_theme=newslibrary2&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=0F8B4F98500EA0F8&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=10&p;_sort=YMD_date:D&s;_trackval=GooglePM Associated Press: U.N. says Taliban starving hungry people for military agenda The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war. On August 8, 1998 the Taliban launched an attack on Mazar-i Sharif. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people based on their ethnicity, especially Hazaras and Uzbeks. Men, women and children were hunted by Taliban forces in response to between 1500-3000 Taliban fighters executed by the Uzbek Junbish-i Milli militia.Afghanistan Justice project, 120 This ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead.  Fall of the Taliban  In 2001, Human Rights Watch voiced the fear that ethnic violence in Afghanistan was likely to increase due to the conflict between the different factions escalating. Thousands of Pashtun people became refugees as they fled Uzbek Junbish-i Milli troops some of whom were reported as looting, raping and kidnapping when they were disarming Pashtuns accused of being former Taliban supporters in northern Afghanistan during the early stages of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) which removed the dominantly Pashtun Taliban from power.  Political measures  In 2010 the Afghan President Hamid Karzai set up a panel to investigate continuing ethnic violence as he believes it is hampering the military efforts to contain the Taliban insurgency.

David Whitehead. Early life Born about 1492, he was a native of Hampshire; his contemporary Hugh Whitehead (died 1551), with whom David Whitehead has sometimes been confused, was from the County Durham area. David Whitehead is said to have been educated at Brasenose College, Oxford or All Souls College, Oxford, but his name does not appear in the registers. He was tutor to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who died in 1551. During the winter of 1549‚Äì50 Whitehead, Thomas Lever and Roger Hutchinson endeavoured to convert Joan Bocher from her heresies. On Brandon's death Whitehead retained a prominent position as chaplain to his widow, Catherine Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk. On 25 November 1551 he took part in the discussion on transubstantiation at William Cecil's house. At this point he was positioned with the Cambridge-dominated evangelical faction at court, with John Cheke and others. In 1552 Thomas Cranmer described him as \\"Mr. Whitehead of Hadley\\"; and on 25 August suggested him to Cecil as a candidate for the vacant Archbishop of Armagh. Whitehead, however, refused the appointment, and Hugh Goodacre became archbishop. In exile Soon after Queen Mary's accession Whitehead left for the continent; he was one of the 175 who sailed with Jan ≈Åaski from Gravesend on 17 September 1553. Whitehead was in the smaller vessel which reached Copenhagen on 3 November; there the exiles were taken for Anabaptists, and soon expelled by order of the king on their refusing to subscribe to the Lutheran confession. They then made their way to Rostock, where Whitehead pleaded their cause before the magistrates, whose Lutheran requirements they failed to satisfy, and they were compelled to leave in January. A similar fate befell them at Wismar, L√ºbeck, and Hamburg, but they found a refuge at Emden in March 1554. Meanwhile an attempt was being made to found a church of English exiles at Frankfurt, and on 2 August 1554 an invitation was sent to Whitehead and other exiles at Emden to join it. Whitehead went there on 24 October, and took over the congregation for a time, as John Knox wrote. Whitehead was one of those who wished to retain the use of the English Prayer Book of 1552, and in the debates at Frankfurt he took the side of Richard Cox against Knox. After the expulsion of Knox (26 March 1555) Whitehead was chosen pastor of the congregation. On 20 September he and his colleagues wrote a letter to John Calvin to justify their proceedings against Knox, and repudiating the charge of too rigorous adherence to the prayer-book; their ceremonies, they pleaded, were really very few, and they went on to attack Knox's Admonition as inflammatory. In February 1555‚Äì6 Whitehead resigned his pastorate, being succeeded on 1 March by Robert Horne; the cause is said to have been his disappointment at not being made lecturer in divinity in succession to Bartholomew Traheron. He remained, however, at Frankfurt, sharing a house with Richard Alvey, and signing a letter to Heinrich Bullinger on 27 September 1557. Under Elizabeth On Elizabeth I's accession Whitehead returned to England, preaching before the queen on 15 February 1559, taking part in the Westminster disputation with the Roman Catholic bishops on 3 April, and serving as a visitor of Oxford University, and on the commission for revising the liturgy. He is said by biographers to have had the first refusal of the Archbishopric of Canterbury, and he also declined the Mastership of the Savoy. On 17 September 1561 he wrote to Cecil acknowledging his obligations to him, but refusing the living he offered. Whitehead, according to John Whitgift, deplored the excesses of some ministers, but his own leanings were Puritan. On 24 March 1564 he was sequestered for refusing to subscribe. Francis Bacon stated that he opposed episcopacy, and related the anecdote that the queen once said to him \\"I like thee better because thou livest unmarried\\", to which Whitehead replied \\"In troth, madame, I like you the worse for the same cause\\".Bacon's Works, ed. James Spedding, vii. 163. Richard Hilles, however, in announcing Whitehead's death in June 1571, said that Whitehead had lived about seven years a widower, but married a young widow when about eighty. Works Whitehead's writings, with the exception of discourses printed in William Whittingham's Brieff Discours of Troubles at Frankfort (1575), have not been traced. Henry Billingsley, who published the first English edition of Euclid's Elements, is thought to have been tutored in mathematics by Whitehead at Oxford; and it has been argued on the basis of an Oxford tradition that Whitehead played a large part in the translation. This story passed from Robert Barnes in Oxford to Thomas Allen; and from Allen to Brian Twyne. In Anthony Wood a version of this story has \\"Friar Whitehead\\" the source for Billingsley's work.'Friaries: The house of Austin friars', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 2 (1907), pp. 143-148. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40199 Date accessed: 16 April 2012 There is also a tradition that Whitehead was earlier in life an Augustinian friar. In any case the book appeared in 1570, and Whitehead died in 1571. Billingley's first translation of 1568, from Peter Martyr Vermigli, appeared with acknowledgement to Whitehead.

Since 1906, she had been a missionary in the Janjgir-Champa district in Chhattisgarh, India. She was on her way to visit her ailing mother. Early life Annie Funk was born on 12 April 1874 in the small town of Bally, Pennsylvania. Her ancestors, who settled there in the 1700s, were Mennonite emigrants from Germany. Miss Funk attended the State Normal School at West Chester. Her home congregation, the Hereford General Conference Mennonite Church, where her father was a deacon for 25 years, nurtured her interest in missions from childhood. She attended the Northfield Bible Training School in Northfield, Massachusetts that D. L. Moody had begun. After graduation, she worked with the immigrants in the slums of Chattanooga, Tennessee and Paterson, New Jersey. She dreamt of being a missionary. Missionary to India After the stateside assignments, she volunteered to go overseas. She had unqualified trust in God. Once she stated to a friend who feared for her safety on the first transatlantic voyage that, \\"Our heavenly Father is as near to us on sea as on land. My trust is in Him. I have no fear.\\" Thus, her dream of being a missionary was realized in December 1906, when she was sent to India as the first female Mennonite missionary. Annie arrived in India and served in Janjgir-Champa district, in Chhattisgarh. In 1908, she opened a one- room school and hostel for poor girls. The school initially taught 17 students. She also learned Hindi during her stay. The school was later renamed the Annie C Funk Memorial School. Only the outer walls survive today, with a small plaque which describes her brief life and her death. Death Funk's work was interrupted by a telegram which read, \\"Come home at once. Mother very ill. Have purchased on two ships, Pater Shelly.\\" Though she was not told that her mother was close to death, Annie made her travel plans quickly. After a long journey to Liverpool, she learned that the ship that would take her to America would be delayed by a coal strike. Her booking was transferred to . She bought her second class ticket for ¬£13. Titanic left Southampton on April 10, 1912. When on the fourth day of the voyage the ship struck an iceberg, Funk lost her life after (an unconfirmed story holds) giving up her lifeboat seat to a mother and a child.

Though international in nature the institute maintains strong regional ties particularly in the fields of climate adaptation and rural tourism. Its special areas of expertise include; information communication, technology systems, organizational research, environmental research, sustainable tourism, environmental policy and energy production and use and, climate change social impacts, evaluation and adaptation. Research areas =Environment= In accordance with Agenda 21 guidelines, the institute takes the concept of sustainable development as the starting point in its environmental research programmes. Main thematic areas covered are; local environment and climate policy, industrial ecology, sustainable mobility, alternative fuels, and sustainable agriculture. =Innovation= Within this interdisciplinary field the institute is focuses on the following: eGovernment and public sector organisation; Regional development; Infrastructure and networking; eCommerce in small and medium- sized businesses. =Tourism= Within this department the focus is on sustainable tourism, IT and tourism, and leisure-time consumption. =Usability= The institutes work in the field of Usability largely focuses on human computer interfaces (HCI), information architecture and semantic web. Most of the projects are user-oriented and include the following: * Analysis of IT systems (mostly web sites and web applications) with the help of indicator systems * Developing requirements specifications for web sites and web applications * Developing controlled vocabularies for better semantic support in web portals * Analysis and development of search systems, taxonomies and ontologies (through semantic technologies like topic maps) Climate change adaptation The Institute has been engaged in climate specific adaptation projects at a regional level through its involvement with NORADAPT - Community Adaptation and Vulnerability in Norway. Focus has been on how projected changes in climate interact with changes in socio-economic and institutional conditions, and how these interactions shape vulnerability and adaptation at the local level in Norway. This has led to a series of climate adaptation strategies being developed by municipalities such as Fredrikstad and Flora with the support of the Institute. The Institute is currently engaged in identifying the conditions that facilitate or constrain the adaptive capacity of municipalities to climate change with particular emphasis being placed on the interaction of climate and socioeconomic changes. This expertise led to the Institute's involvement with the Northern Periphery Programme (NPP), Clim-ATIC, where it was activity co-ordinator, providing guidance and expertise on local climate change impacts and the combining of climate and socio-economic scenarios . International projects The Institute is engaged in a range of national and international projects and organisations such as POSC Caesar Association POSC Caesar (PCA) an international, open, not-for-profit, member organization that promotes the interoperability of data, software and related matters.

Fifty-five of the cars were purchased for the Reading and Pennsylvania Railroads with public funds for use in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area commuter rail service with the remaining 4 cars being purchased by USDOT for use in high-speed rail experiments in 1965. Based on a series of 6 prototype Pioneer III cars built in 1958, the Silverliners represented the first production order of \\"modern\\" commuter MU equipment purchased by either railroad and earned their name from their unpainted stainless steel construction which contrasted with the painted carbon steel bodies of the pre- war MU fleets. The cars became a fixture of SEPTA Regional Rail service providing the name to their entire series of EMU railcars before finally being retired in 2012 after 49 years in service.  History  Penn Central operated Silverliner II outbound at Chelten Avenue in 1974. In 1963 the financial condition of the Pennsylvania and Reading Railroads was such that neither was able to upgrade their money losing commuter operations on their own. As a result, state and local government stepped in to purchase new cars that would be in turn used by the private railroads to run the required commuter operations through an entity known as the Passenger Service Improvement Corporation. The new cars would be a production order based on 6 1958 Pioneer III type cars with improvements based on the lessons learned from the earlier design. A total of 38 cars were purchased for the PRR with the remaining 17 going to the Reading. While some referred to the new vehicles as \\"PSIC Cars\\", the modern stainless steel body shells quickly defined the fleet and the name \\"Silverliner\\" was soon adopted. In addition to their looks, the cars introduced many other modern innovations to the Philadelphia commuter rail network, including air conditioning, greater interior space (12 feet longer than the PRR MP54) seating up to 127 persons, high acceleration with a greater top speed and near silent operation. The 38 PRR cars were numbered in two series, 201-219 and 250-269 and given PRR classification MP85B and MP85C respectively, while the 17 Reading cars were numbered 9001-9017 and given Reading classification REB-13. With the delivery of the second set of \\"Silverliners\\" in 1967, the original Budd Silverliners were renamed \\"Silverliner II\\" with the Pioneer III cars becoming Silverliner I. In 1968 the Pennsylvania Railroad was merged into the new Penn Central and although funding for the commuter rail services were being provided by the newly formed SEPTA, from 1963 until the formation of Conrail in 1976, the Silverliners were operated by and wore the livery of their respective railroads, the PRR Keystone being replaced by the Penn Central \\"Worms\\" after the merger and the Reading diamond throughout. After 1976 the service continued to be operated under Conrail, but the cars were fully branded as SEPTA and would operate as such until the end of their careers. Former Reading class car #9001 seen at Wayne Junction in 2010. In late 1984 the Center City Commuter Connection opened allowing the Reading and PRR cars to mix and roam about either \\"side\\" of the system. In 1989 the entire fleet was sent to the Morrison-Knudsen plant in Hornell, New York, for a mid-life overhaul. In addition to this all of the cars eventually received upgrades to their propulsion system to increase reliability and remove PCBs from their transformers, upgraded HVAC systems to eliminate CFCs. In the 1990s the cars received SEPTA's standard full length Red and Blue window decal wrapping and some of the cars had a minor interior upgrade with the original \\"ketchup and mustard\\" seats being converted to a padded brown leather appearance. By the year 2000 the cars' age was becoming apparent with decreasing reliability and lack of ADA compliance which included the manually operated doors which were becoming a hindrance at SEPTA's increasing number of stations equipped with high level platforms. However design delays and a contract bidding dispute delayed the order of their 120 replacement Silverliner V cars until past 2005 and then problems with the builder, Hyundai Rotem, setting up a production facility in South Philadelphia, further delayed deliveries until 2010.http://articles.philly.com/2010-12-04/news/25292587_1_septa-new-cars- delays During this period an increasing number of Silverliner II cars began to be sidelined with serious mechanical problems with a few even catching fire in service.http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/SEPTA-Train-on- Fire-69064652.html Due to the lack of a public address system the Silverliner II's were operating under an ADA waiver set to expire on July 1, 2012, and with deliveries of Silverliner V cars accelerating SEPTA began to retire cars as their FRA 92-day inspections ran out. By May 2012 most Silverliner II's had been retired and in their final week of service the last operating Silverliner II, #9010, was sent to run on the Cynwyd Line with the final run taking place on June 29.  Design  Interior of a Budd Silverliner showing the leatherette decor applied to cars 259, 269, 9012 and 9015 in place of the standard \\"Ketchup and Mustard\\" styling. The design of the Budd Silverliner was based on a lightweight stainless steel body and frame coupled to an advanced AC/DC rectifier propulsion system and new lightweight, high-speed trucks. While largely identical to the earlier Pioneer III's, differences included a single-arm Faiveley pantograph, a state-of-the-art propulsion system that made use of solid-state phase angle controllers coupled to mercury arc ignitron rectifiers, higher-powered motors, a higher-capacity main transformer, multi- function couplers and disc brakes. One result of these upgrades was that the Silverliners were incompatible with the six Pioneer prototypes. Passenger amenities were also identical to the Pioneer III cars offering riders air cushion suspension, air conditioning, electric train heat and a nearly silent acceleration and braking. With more than the Pioneer III cars ( total), the Silverliners could achieve a acceleration rate, which was far higher than the older MP54s and a top speed of compared with the of the MP54 fleet (which was not often reached in service). Inside, the cars were equipped with 25 rows of 3+2 reversible (flipover) bench seating with 124 usable seats and either a bathroom or an additional 3-person bench seat. The seats were initially furnished in a dark gray diamond-patterned foam rubber \\"plush\\", which began to wear out by the mid-1970s. Four cars (#259, #269, #9012 and #9015) were experimentally retrofitted with brown vinyl leatherette seats. However, the balance of the fleet was redone in the SEPTA/Conrail era with canvas-textured padded covering in a so-called \\"Ketchup and Mustard\\" theme, with the three- person seats upholstered in mustard yellow and the two-person seats done in a dark ketchup red. Side view of the Budd Pioneer III truck on Silverliner II No. 9009 showing the suspension elements and cowcatcher applied to the Reading cars. Despite both Reading and PRR cars being paid for in part by the PSIC, each railroad was allowed to put their own stamp on the design. These differences included the PRR units being fitted with only one overhead luggage rack, a bar pilot, a metal-framed engineer's window and position-light cab signals, with the Reading cars being fitted with a cowcatcher, twin overhead luggage racks, and color light (though PRR-compatible) cab signals; the latter were removed after the RDG discontinued its 1928 cab signal installation on the Bethlehem Branch between Jenkintown and Lansdale in 1967, and 9001‚Äì9017 would have to be re-equipped with cab signal equipment in 1983‚Äì84 in preparation for operation through the Center City Commuter Connection and former PRR lines. The first group of PRR cars (201‚Äì219) were intended by be used on longer distance runs to places like Harrisburg, PA and New York City and were equipped with a bathroom on the \\"F\\" end to facilitate this. The second set of PRR cars, along with all of the Reading cars, were not equipped with comfort facilities, substituting a 3-person bench seat is its place. While all of the Silverliner cars were delivered with disc brakes, the PRR disliked this feature as it required trains to be placed over a drop pit for routine brake work, and all of their 38 cars were converted to conventional tread brakes by 1968. The Reading cars were not converted to tread braking until rebuilding in the SEPTA era in 1989. In addition to the disc brakes, all classes of Budd Silverliner were delivered with an early multi-function coupler design that consisted of an AAR \\"tightlock\\" knuckle coupler mounted above a separate automatic coupler for air and electrical connections. This design allowed the new MU cars to be attached (in emergencies or planned shop moves) for towing behind locomotives, conventional passenger and heavyweight MU cars, or in freight trains; the outer ends of the stepboxes were lettered with detailed instructions to train crews for doing so. However, the newer fleet of 232 Silverliner IVs were delivered with Budd's new \\"pin and cup\\" coupler and both the Silverliner II and III fleets were modified to both couple to and MU with the IVs, as opposed to the older cars the IVs were replacing. When this change was carried out the Penn Central fitted its cars with a welded bar pilot to protect the leading wheels from debris impact.

Experimental Silverliners  T-3 at 16th Street Station in Oakland, California in 1981 As part of the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 the United States Department of Transportation placed an order for 4 additional Silverliners for use as test vehicles to explore the feasibility of a high-speed rail line in the United States. Numbered T-1 through T-4, the cars were modified for operation up to speeds of 150 mph and were outfitted with various instrumentation to document the effects of rail travel at such speeds including CCTV cameras to monitor the wheels and pantograph.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW7mEoZypX8 The most visible change was a slightly streamlined slab end applied to the T-1 car to reduce drag at high speed after the 4-car trainset was unable to reach the 150 mph speed target with the stock end. With the new streamlining in place the train was able to reach a top speed of 156 mph on the straight track between Trenton and New Brunswick, New Jersey. As a result, this same level of deflection was applied to the front ends of the production high-speed MU Budd Metroliners. During the tests the cars were based at the PRR's Morrisville Yard engine facility, and after the tests were completed at least one of the cars was de- powered and used as a USDOT rail testing vehicle for some years afterward, and one was used by the U.S. Army at Fort Eustis. T-1 was purchased by a private buyer in 2015 and moved to the South Carolina Railway Museum, to be converted into a lounge car. T-2 exists as an office for the AAFES warehouse in Lee Hall, VA. T-3 and T-4 are presumed scrapped, but T-4 is unaccounted for. Its whereabouts are unknown.

Gomis was born in Barcelona on September 19, 1902 to a wealthy family. His father owned a business in the cotton trade and his grandfather Cels Gomis (Reus, 1842 - Barcelona, 1915) was a civil engineer with intellectual interests. At the age of twelve, Gomis acquired his first camera‚àía Brownie‚àíwhich he used to take his first photographs. In 1919 he received his degree in accounting, and beginning in 1921 he lived in England and the United States. These periods abroad enabled Gomis to produce photo series based on the architecture and urban landscapes of the places he visited. In 1929 he married Odette Cherbonnier in Paris. Joaquim Gomis was well-respected in artistic circles, which were somewhat taken aback when he began photographing the work of Gaud√≠, an architect who was underrated at the time. In 1930 Gomis became a founding member and the first president of the Amics de l'art nou (Friends of New Art) association and was also a founding member of Club 49 in 1949. During the Spanish Civil War, Gomis lived in Paris and traveled in Europe. In 1939, at the end of the war, he returned to Barcelona. In 1940, in collaboration with Joan Prats, Gomis published his fotoscops, a series of books with images in sequential order. Although his first series was about a eucalyptus, some of the subjects he covered were Gaud√≠'s Sagrada Familia church, the Cathedral of Tarragona, the works of Joan Mir√≥, and the city of Barcelona. His photographic production can be associated with the Neues Sehen movement and is considered one of the exceptions within a context dominated by pictorialism. In 1952 he was named president of the Amics de Gaud√≠ (Friends of Gaud√≠) group, and from 1972 to 1975 he presided over the Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥. Exhibitions of Joaquim Gomis' work include a show held at the IVAM in Valencia in 1997, with previously unpublished images from the period he spent in the United States from 1922 to 1923. Some of his works are held in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

Upon arrival Victor was the representation of the MƒÅori people on the show and subsequently, his storylines often focused on his emphasis towards MƒÅori healthcare. However, despite his primarily ethical storylines, Victor soon became a central character dealing with large story arcs that consisted primarily of melodramatic storylines. These included helping his girlfriend overcome rape, becoming involved with gangs, being framed for murder twice, launching a euthanasia cover up scandal and losing his wife to his young son. By 2001, producers had introduced a family unit for Victor, with the Hudsons, headed by Victor's sister - Te Hana (Vanessa Rare) arriving. His son and daughter - Nelson (Quinton Hita) and Jay Copeland (Jaime Passier-Armstrong) arrived in 2002 and 2004 respectively. The character departed on Christmas Day 2004 with girlfriend - Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi) following his nephews wedding. The character, his storylines and relationships received a generally mixed response. Victor's marriage with Anne (Emmeline Hawthorne) got a lukewarm reception, with the wedding episode receiving praise whilst the actual partnership got negative criticism. Creation and casting Calvin Tuteao was cast as Victor and made his debut in 2000. Tuteao stated, \\"Acting's not work to me. I always have fun on set. You get looked after, meet some good people and have a laugh,\\" and was pleased to be playing a \\"good guy\\". One of the purposes of the character was to portray community health and MƒÅori based healthcare on the medical based programme. The character survived the show's revamp throughout 2000 to 2001 and his onscreen family was introduced in 2001, with sister Te Hana and her family arriving. Victor's own children, Nelson and Jay Copeland later arrived as part of the core cast. Victor departed the show on Christmas Day 2004. Storylines Victor was employed by the clinic in 2000 and started to date Sofia Martinez (Lena Cruz). However the two broke up and Victor started to date Kate (Rebecca Hobbs) who was raped shortly into the relationship by her obsessive friend - Eamon (Neill Rea). Victor stopped Kate from suicide and helped her recover from the traumatizing event however Kate left him and Victor started sleeping with Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi). The romance with Donna didn't last and Victor became CEO. Victor briefly dated Mere Jonhnson (Caroline McLaughlin) before leaving her for young nurse, Anne Greenlaw (Emmeline Hawthorne). The two soon got engaged and Victor saved his niece - Mihi (Quantrelle King) from a gang led by Kurt Matakoare (Gordon Hatfield). Victor and Anne married but the ceremony was ruined when Victor was arrested for a murder Kurt committed. He was eventually released and Kurt was arrested. Victor and Anne decided to adopt the baby of Victor's teenage nephew - Tama (David Wikaira-Paul) but Victor discovered Anne was having an affair with his son Nelson Copeland (Quinton Hita) and the marriage was over. He started a short lived affair with Li Mei Chen (Li Ming Hu). Victor resigned as CEO following the revelation he had covered up Geoff's (Andrew Laing) frequent use of euthanasia, however found himself a suspect when Geoff was murdered. He turned back to Donna for support and the two started a relationship following Anne's tragic death. Victor's estranged daughter - Jay (Jaime Passier- Armstrong) arrived and the two finally reconciled however Victor was arrested for Geoff's death and was found guilty by a jury despite evidence proving he was with Li Mei at the time of Geoff's death. The true killer - Dominic Thompson (Shane Cortese) eventually confessed to the murder as he died and Victor was released. He departed with Donna to live in Australia following Tama's wedding on Christmas Day 2004. Victor phoned Jay in 2006 to decline the invitation to her civil union as he did not believe it was a real wedding. In 2007 Chris (Michael Galvin) phoned Victor to tell him of Jay's murder. In 2008 Donna and Victor sent Chris a card to express their sadness that they could not attend Toni's (Laura Hill) funeral. Character development =Relationship with Anne Greenlaw= In 2002 Victor and Anne Greenlaw embarked on a relationship. There was huge contrast between the middle aged head of hospital and the young nurse, but Tuteao praised the relationship saying; \\"Love knows no age, no colour ... She sort of makes him want to be a better man. Or try to be.\\" The two got engaged despite Anne developing feelings for Victor's son Nelson, who was the same age. Despite not acting on her feelings, Anne continued to grow attracted to Nelson as the wedding drew closer. The filming of the wedding meant three days of filming in cold conditions whilst onscreen it was to be a picturesque ceremony that was to be the soap's biggest wedding since Gina and Leonard's in 1993. Tuteao enjoyed the experience saying; \\"Had loads of extras, making heaps of noise out here ‚Äî the place was rocking.\\" The two married but after the vowels Victor was arrested for murder after being framed by nemesis Kurt (Gordon Hatfield). However Anne did end up having an affair with Nelson and when Victor found out, he was infuriated and ended the relationship. When Anne was crushed by a collapsing building in the 2003 cliffhanger, Tuteao agreed that the two were too different, stating; \\"They're not really compatible, I suppose. They're totally different. Maybe he just wanted a younger woman, a trophy wife. But I think Victor would miss her, too, if she dies.\\" When Anne died, despite having moved on to Donna, Victor was devastated and was forced to reevaluate his life. Reception Victor has been described as a \\"favourite\\" character. His wedding to Anne was labelled \\"memorable\\". Frances Grant of The New Zealand Herald was critical of the character and his storylines, calling the romance storyline with Anne; silly and hoping Kahu would be revealed as the murder of Geoff so that he would be written off. She later called Victor \\"immensely unlikeable\\" and criticized his facial hair. The arrival of Victor and his son Nelson was praised in relation to MƒÅori presence, with Nelsons portrayer Quniton Hita stating; \\"I have to tip my hat to the show. It's gone a long way down the track in trying to present MƒÅori in a positive light. And also, I suppose, trying to naturalise the contribution that MƒÅori make to our society.\\" The storyline that saw Dominic Thompson frame Victor as Geoff's murderer has gone down as iconic. Michael Galvin (Dr. Chris Warner) highlighted the episode where Chris and Victor participated in a hospital musical as the lowlight of his career on the soap. The episode aired on September 12, 2001 and was subsequently the lowest rated episode to ever air. Victor and Anne's relationship was also criticized, being called \\"bizarre\\" and \\"not right\\".

Creation and casting In 2000 an Australian consultant made several large changes to the show that would see a more working class hospital portrayed. Tama, his parents Joe and Te Hana and sister Mihi were created because of this. As part of the revamp, producers wished for a more community based cast with established family links, mimicking the past presence of the Warner and McKenna families. Nineteen-year-old David Wikaira-Paul was cast in the role. In 2006 the character was axed alongside 5 other characters as part of a revamp. The revamp was an attempt to create a culturally proportional cast after the exit of the only Pacific Islander, Pua Magasiva. Storylines Tama arrived alongside his family but it was soon clear to his friend Delphi (Anna Hutchison) that Tama enjoyed music a lot more than he did playing rugby as his father Joe (Rawiri Paratene) wished. Tama began to secretly date his sisters best friend Shannon Te Ngaru (Amber Cureen) and the two started a physical relationship that landed Shannon pregnant. The two decided to adopt their baby out at birth and reconciled, but the baby boy died shortly after birth and the relationship fell apart. However, when Shannon attempted suicide and Tama nearly died in a building collapse, the two decided to commit to a future together ad got engaged. Despite appearing happy, whilst Tama was away Shannon started an affair with Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) and the two later broke up only to reconcile and get engaged once again. The two married on Christmas Day and replaced the missing wedding rings with beach shells. He two took in Tama's troublesome cousin Eti Kawaka (Isaac Bell) and Shannon again fell pregnant, giving birth to Rangimarie Hudson (Mia Curreen-Poko) in May. However, it soon became clear Shannon was unhappy and she again strayed from Tama with his cousin Whetu (Taungaroa Emile) and the two separated for good. Tama and Shannon fought for custody of Rangimarie and ended up on agreeing to Shannon being sole guardian. Tama left Ferndale to live with his family. Reception Producer Simon Bennett did not enjoy the introduction of the Hudson family, stating: \\"With the best will in the world the intention to introduce a down on their luck Maori family who moved from the country to the city came across as mawkish and somewhat PC in flavour.\\" Playing Tama reportedly earned Wikaira-Paul huge popularity, especially amongst young audiences and he received the most fan mail. Parents of the young viewers reportedly hoped everything would work out for Tama. Tama and Shannon were also a hugely popular couple with fans constantly hoping the two would have a happy ending. The love triangle storyline between Tama, Shannon and Vinnie was singled out as a favourite romance storyline from the 2004 season.

It is the ancient parish church of Eastergate, although since 1992 it has been administered as part of a joint ecclesiastical parish with the churches in neighbouring Barnham and Aldingbourne. As part of this group, the building is still in regular use for worship on Sundays and weekdays. Eastergate village school has links with the church, and pupils regularly attend services. There is historic and structural evidence of a Saxon place of worship on the site, and some 11th-century work survives in the chancel, but the present appearance of the church is mostly 13th-century. It was then restored in the Victorian era, and some further rebuilding work was undertaken in the 20th century. The \\"long, straggling village\\" of Eastergate is administratively located in the district of Arun, one of seven local government districts in West Sussex. The church is in a rural situation south of the village street; it is approached through a farmyard next to the manor house, and a \\"magnificent\\" Elizabethan granary building that was originally part of the farm has been used by the church for various purposes since the 1970s. English Heritage has listed both buildings for their architectural and historical importance: St George's Church at Grade II*, and the former granary at the lower Grade II. History In its earliest form, the parish of Eastergate covered of flat, flood-prone land on the Sussex coastal plain, about northeast of the modern seaside resort of Bognor Regis and a similar distance southwest of the ancient town of Arundel. Romans apparently occupied the area, and may have established a villa near the modern village. A church in the parish was recorded in the Domesday survey of 1086; it was near the western edge of the parish, so St Mary the Virgin's Church at Barnham was more convenient for some parishioners, and likewise some residents of the neighbouring parish of Aldingbourne worshipped at Eastergate. By the following year, it was associated with the Norman Abbey of S√©ez, whose other holdings in the area included the manors of Atherington (with Bailiffscourt Chapel) and Littlehampton. The south wall of the chancel has ancient herringbone pattern brickwork using Roman bricks. The present building was started around the time of the Norman conquest of England. Several church historians have come to different conclusions about its origins: it has been suggested that the chancel is Saxon, that the whole building is the one recorded in the Domesday Book, that it is \\"possibly pre-Conquest\\", or that (per Gerard Baldwin Brown) it dates from \\"within 50 years of the Norman conquest\\" and lacks any \\"distinctive Saxon features\\". An ancient surviving feature is the herringbone pattern masonry in the south wall of the chancel: this extends to about and is up to thick. Some more herringbone brickwork, now covered up, exists in the south wall of the nave. Much Roman brickwork has been reused, both in the herringbone work and in the form of a course of long bricks in the south wall of the chancel. Again, sources disagree as to whether this reuse of old material is a late Saxon or early Norman feature. Elsewhere, only one window survives from the church's earliest times: a \\"primitive\\" narrow opening in the north wall of the chancel. This vestry was added in the 1920s. The nave in its present form dates from the 13th and 14th centuries: no features remain from the original structure. There is a wide range of medieval windows throughout, ranging from 14th-century openings in the nave and Early English Gothic lancets in the chancel to a 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic east window in the chancel and an arched window of 1534 in the west wall. The church was re- roofed internally in two stages: the nave in the 16th century (it was given a crown post roof), and the chancel in the following century. A structural survey in 1776 indicated that the chancel was deteriorating but the nave was sound. The first round of Victorian restoration came in 1856, when a gallery was inserted; the chancel was rebuilt and heightened between 1876 and 1877; and in 1883 the nave was altered, a vestry was added, the gallery was taken out and a wooden bell-turret was built at the west end of the building. Nikolaus Pevsner stated that after this work, the church was \\"too heavily restored to be attractive\\", and others have noted that the present appearance of the church is derived mostly from its 19th-century modifications. Later work included the replacement of the Victorian vestry with a new equivalent in the 1920s, the replacement of some stained glass and internal fittings around the same time, and the provision of modern facilities including a \\"welcome area\\" near the entrance, toilets, kitchen facilities, new heating and better lighting in 2000. A modern wooden sculpture of Saint George has also been provided, and a late-20th-century tapestry commemorates the history of Eastergate parish and the church. It makes reference to the Domesday Book entry for the village, which uses its original name of Gate. Architecture This overhanging shingled bell-turret sits on top of the tiled roof. St George's Church has a nave with no aisles, a narrower chancel and a bell- turret at the west end of the roof. There is a vestry on the north side. Most walls are roughcast covering flint rubble; the chancel is mostly of uncovered flint with some herringbone brickwork. The roof is tiled, and the bell-turret is laid with shingles. It is an \\"uncomplicated building with no buttresses\\" and little ornamentation, although Nikolaus Pevsner described the offset, overhanging bell-turret as \\"frilly\\". It contains a single bell dated 1737 and inscribed with the name of a former churchwarden. Enclosed shingled bell- turrets were uncommon in the Victorian era: the addition of open-sided stone- built bellcotes was more popular. The nave measures . At the corners are quoins made up of stones of various sizes‚Äîas large as tall in one case. A 14th-century doorway survives on the north side, although it is now walled up. The lancet windows date from the 14th and 15th centuries but have been restored. One on the south side has the remains of some contemporary stained glass showing the coats of arms of the FitzAlans (the Earls of Arundel) and the de Warennes (the Earls of Surrey). Designed in quarters, it dates from the 1360s. The others are paired lancets with cinquefoil (five-lobed) lights above. In the west wall of the nave is a three-light window paid for in 1534 under the terms of a will; it has plain arched heads without cusping. Money from the same bequest paid for a small extension () to the nave, and a new doorway was added at the same time. This 17th-century half-timbered granary is used for church activities. The chancel's dimensions are . As on the nave walls, there are stone quoins. The oldest surviving window in the church is a slit-style Norman opening in its north wall. On the outside, the jambs are formed of three substantial stones with slight chamfering‚Äîthe lowest and uppermost laid flat and the middle stone standing upright. Between them is a sloping sill, and at the top a semicircular arch connects the jambs. It is placed high in the wall, just below the roofline. The south wall has two 13th- century windows, and the three-light east window of the 15th century has stained glass as a memorial to Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. Internal fittings include 18th-century altar rails and a rare pair of priest's stalls in a mixed Gothic and Classical style, dating from the early 19th century. They face each other across the chancel and consist of paired wooden pillars and an \\"oddly out of place ... severely Classical\\" tester. Fragments of wall paintings of the 11th and 12th centuries remain above some of the chancel windows: they were uncovered in 1907. These were \\"convincingly linked to the 'Lewes Group' of 12th-century wall paintings in the Sussex churches of Hardham, Clayton and Coombes.\\"Rickerby & Shekede unpublished report for the Parish and the Council for the Care of Churches, July 2005 In 2003, the collapse of a wall monument revealed traces of painting on the exposed plaster beneath. A palimpsest was present with traces of post-Reformation text painting. This has been conserved as a 'window' on the historic plasters and painting layers. The church is reached by walking through the grounds of Manor Farm; it is common for ancient Sussex churches to stand close to farms, but for one to stand in a farmyard is unusual. Standing outside the approach to the church is a \\"magnificent\\" granary apparently dating from the 17th century (one source attributes it to the late Elizabethan or early Stuart period, and others claim a date of 1600). The hipped-roofed building is constructed of red brick with timber framing. It stands on staddle stones‚Äîmushroom-shaped supports that lift the structure clear of the ground as a safeguard against damp and vermin. Some restoration has been carried out. Originally, it was part of the neighbouring Manor Farm‚Äî\\"one of the best farmhouses in this part of Sussex\\" according to Nikolaus Pevsner‚Äîbut since the 1970s it has been used for various purposes by St George's Church. The church today St George's Church was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 5 June 1958. Such buildings are defined as \\"particularly important [and] of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 24 Grade II* listed buildings, and 960 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Arun. The former granary near the church entrance was listed at Grade II on the same date. Buildings listed at this grade are \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". Both the church and the farm are also part of the Eastergate (Church Lane) Conservation Area, one of 33 conservation areas in Arun. In its assessment of the area, which was designated in June 1992, the district council stated that it \\"retains its rural character and the essential historic characteristics of a rural agricultural settlement based on the manor house, St George's Church and farm buildings\\". St Mary the Virgin's Church at Barnham is also within the parish. The ecclesiastical parish includes St Mary the Virgin's Church, Aldingbourne, St Mary the Virgin's Church, Barnham and St George's Church. It covers the three villages and the surrounding rural area, and hamlets such as Norton, Fontwell, Lidsey and Woodgate. The larger village of Westergate is also part of the parish. St George's is one of 30 Anglican churches in the Rural Deanery of Arundel and Bognor, a division within the Archdeaconry of Chichester and the Diocese of Chichester. Regular services are held in the church, which can accommodate 80 worshippers with ease. On special festivals it often accommodates in excess of 150 worshippers Every Sunday morning, Mattins and Holy Communion are celebrated using the Book of Common Prayer. A family service, usually with Holy Communion, is held at 10.00 am, and at 6.00 pm there is an evening prayer service or Evensong, depending on the Sunday of the month. A Holy Communion service also takes place on Wednesday mornings. The present rectory was built in the 1920s and given to the Parish by the Davenport family in 1976 on the main road to Barnham‚Äîbut two earlier buildings were also used for this purpose. The rector was known to live in the village by 1440, and the original rectory was first described in 1473. Vacated by the early 18th century, it became ruinous and was demolished in the 1830s in favour of a Tudor-style flint building on Church Lane. This was used by the rector until the present building was donated.

The freight rail bypass allows freight trains to avoid the busy Karlsruhe Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) on a separate direct line. The freight rail bypass is classified as a main line and has two tracks throughout and is electrified. It has the highest German track class of D4, which means that the line is built for axle loads of 22.5 tonnes and loads of 8.0 tonnes per metre of train. The PZB 90 intermittent cab signalling system is used on the freight rail bypass. This contrasts with the parallel access line to the central station, which is protected by the LZB train protection system. History The line was opened in 1895 with the marshalling yard it served in the southeast of the city. In the northeast it was connected via a branch line from the Rhine Valley Railway running between the old Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof and the old Durlach station. Another connection was opened in 1895, passing under the Hauptbahnhof‚ÄìDurlach line to the Rhine Railway to Graben. In the southwest, there were also connections to the existing line from the old Hauptbahnhof to Ettlingen-West, and‚Äîafter crossing under them‚Äîthe lines to W√∂rth and to Durmersheim (also opened in 1895). In 1913, the new Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof was built near the marshalling yard. The freight lines were engineered so that they largely avoided crossing the passenger lines to the Hauptbahnhof. The old Karlsruhe freight yard had been connected directly to the old Rhine Valley Railway on the line to the old Hauptbahnhof near the city centre, so the dead-end yard was now only accessible via the bypass from the direction of Hagsfeld, or via a track construction plant from the old Durlach‚ÄìKarlsruhe line from the north side or via another track from this line from the south side. The same was true of access to the old Durlach freight yard. Even the former Karlsruhe locomotive workshop near the former Karlsruhe freight yard was now only accessible via the bypass. Passenger services were introduced in 1913 on the bypass because the lines from the new central station ran to the Palatinate via Karlsruhe West and the new M√ºhlburg station via this line. Current situation A container terminal was formerly located between the marshalling yard and the passenger line between Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof and Durlach and on the other side of Wolfartsweierer Stra√üe there was a loading facility with two tracks. A large scale freight yard originally planned there as a replacement for the abandoned Karlsruhe Durlach freight yard has not been realised. The area of the former Karlsruhe locomotive workshop and the closed parts of the freight yard have been used to extend the S√ºdstadt district and for a new neighbourhood park, the Ostauepark. The marshalling yard‚Äôs hump yard is closed. Its former tracks are now used for the parking of old wagons. Other tracks are used for parking freight trains and locomotives. Line VzG 4210 connects the freight bypass to the line to Graben in both directions at Hagsfeld via a flying junction. In contrast, the links to the freight bypass from the lines from Bruchsal (VzG 4217) and Pforzheim (VzG 4211) only directly connect with the tracks running from Pforzheim and Bruchsal, requiring trains running in the opposite direction to cross tracks at-grade. The track that formerly connected the yard towards Pforzheim without requiring an at-grade crossing has been closed. Line VzG 4214 connects the bypass to the line to Durmersheim and line VzG 4213 connects to the line to Ettlingen; both are grade-separated in both directions. Line VzG 4215, which connects towards W√∂rth, is a single track line and initially passes under the Palatine Maximilian Railway and later connects with it at Karlsruhe West at an at-grade junction.

It was built onto the back of Teylers Oval Room in 1838. It was the young museum's first exhibition space for paintings and could be entered through the Oval Room, which was itself located behind the Fundatiehuis, the former home of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst. History Johan Conrad Greive, Interior of Paintings Gallery I, drawing, 1862. Teylers Foundation started collecting contemporary Dutch paintings in 1821. The paintings were either commissioned directly from the painters or acquired at exhibitions. The first room used to display paintings was the room that is today used as a print cabinet and was added to the Oval room in 1824 along with the library room upstairs.article M.

(in Dutch). The lack of light quickly made viewing the paintings there unpopular and it was used mostly for lectures and experiments. According to the archives, the expansion was done by the foundation's own building crew that was on hand for day-to-day improvements. The gallery had large curved windows like the Oval room, which have since been closed. An impression of the original windows can be seen in a charcoal sketch by Johan Conrad Greive in 1862. The collection today is mostly based on that same group of paintings. The gallery also contains a table that was used to hold the portfolios of drawings and a similar portfolio with Rembrandt and Michelangelo reproductions can still be consulted (the actual drawings are held in special storage). Paintings The selection of paintings was done mostly according to the advice of the curator and concierge, who lived in the Fundatiehuis. For the early days this was Vincent Jansz van der Vinne. Van der Vinne was replaced by Wybrand Hendriks, whose own works, those of his friends, and works by his successor Gerrit Jan Micha√´lis hang in the gallery. No works by Van der Vinne are represented, who left Teylers after a disagreement with Martin van Marum. One of the first large canvases to be purchased (1825) was Storm at sea, by the marine painter Johannes Christiaan Schotel.

Produced to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Papua, it starred Clara Sinta, Samuel Tunya, and Minus C. Caroba. Plot At a mob (party) in Papua, Minus (Minus C. Caroba), a high school student, is preparing for sexual relations with twin girls. Meanwhile, his friend Joseph (Samuel Tunya) and Yolanda have sex in the shadows of the party. Unbeknownst to Joseph, Yolanda is infected with AIDS. When Yolanda's family discover her infection, they burn her alive as she has shamed the family. Together with Minus, Joseph ‚Äî now aware that he is infected ‚Äî makes his way back to his hometown to look for a job cutting agarwood. In town, they meet a prostitute named Madonna (Clara Sinta), who was sent to Papua from Java by her pimp after being infected with AIDS. When she discovers that Joseph is also infected, she takes him in, while refusing advances by other woodcutters. When he dies, Madonna and Minus mourn in their own ways, Madonna by lighting a candle and Minus by watching a video of his friend. Production Mencari Madonna was sponsored by the Science, Esthetics, and Technology (, or SET) Foundation, which was established by Garin Nugroho; Nugroho also produced. John de Rantau was chosen to direct; it was his feature film debut, although he had shot sinetron (local soap operas) before. According to the director and producer, the film arose from a trip the two made to Papua at the behest of the current governor. In Papua, they discovered that the area's permissive attitude towards premarital sex had led it to having the second-most HIV/AIDS cases in Indonesia. When Nugroho was unable to provide a shooting script, de Rantau and the locally-cast actors shot ‚Äî Clara Sinta was the only professional actor involved ‚Äî without one. The film, with a budget of Rp 400 million (US$ 50,000), was finished in one week. Leo Sutanto of SinemArt donated Rp 300 million towards its production. Style Mencari Madonna minimises its depictions of violence; Evieta Fadjat, writing for Tempo, notes that several scenes, including the one in which Yolanda is burned to death by her parents, could have been further expanded on, but were only shown as flashes. She also noted that there was much symbolism involved, such as sex scenes being represented by shots of green bras. De Rantau described the film as a visual essay, which had shot using the French theory of \\"outer cinema\\". Release and reception Mencari Madonna was released in 2005. In 2006 it was screened at the Alba International Film Festival in Italy under the title In cerca di Madonna. Dennis Harvey, who reviewed the film for Variety when it was screened at the San Francisco Film Festival in 2006, wrote that the film had \\"upbeat, progressive-minded content despite melodramatics\\", but suffered from plot holes exacerbated by poor subtitles.

The ep was released 16 April 2012 on I-innovate (UK) and featured various artists.  Background  The ep was the 2012 digital version of a vinyl UK Garage ep compilation released several years earlier by Greasy Geezers. The inspiration for the revival release was the featured track Elizabeth (Queen‚Äôs Heads) which coincided with UK events surrounding the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Originally the vinyl edition was presented by UK Urban promoter DJ Iron (Ian Moore) and South London based producer Chino. The main track of the ep Elizabeth was originally produced by Chino featuring MC Skalza who were performers in the early-00‚Äôs on the London UK Garage circuit at venues such as REX, Ceasar‚Äôs and Ocean. The digital release also features material by East London based vocalists Thunder and Flow and the production unit Hekcentrik.  Artwork and music video  Reminiscent of previous releases by Greasy Geezers the artwork and music video showcases a lighthearted graffiti based cartoon style. The ep cover depicts the theme of the release with Queen Elizabeth II as a metaphor for money. The term Queens Heads is a reference to the Queens face on British pound notes. The audiovisual supporting the release is a humorous animated montage. Artwork and audiovisuals were provided by I-innovate Communications. Original 12-inch vinyl edition released on the 'Greasy Geezers' label  Reaction  The digital version was featured on urban music magazine sites.

History =Origin and name= The site of the hospital (originally the Bank) was occupied from 1852 until the 1950s by La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana. At the time of the Revolution in 1959 the building was only partially completed - it was to be the Banco Nacional de Cuba and some of its dependencies such as the Stock Exchange. The decision was eventually made to complete the construction and turn it into a hospital, which was finally opened in 1982, 23 years later. The hospital was named after the Ameijeiras Brothers, which the Cuban state considers to be heroes of the Revolution.\\"Cuatro hermanos que lo dieron todo por la Revoluci√≥n\\", Somos jovenes digital =Corruption incident= In 1999 the Miami Herald reported that a government crackdown on corruption had extended to Hermanos Ameijeiras, uncovering that three top officials there had mishandled hard-currency income and as a result were fired or forced to resign.\\"HAVANA HOSPITAL OFFICIALS FORCED OUT IN CORRUPTION CRACKDOWN\\", Miami Herald - July 2, 1999 p12A =2007 film= In the 2007 film Sicko by Michael Moore, Moore took a group of Americans to Cuba to show that the quality of care that they would receive there, this to prove a point that a socialized medical system could provide the patients better care than they would receive in the U.S., where those patients would not have money or insurance to pay for good care in the private U.S. health care system. Moore insisted in the movie as well as in an interview with John Stossel of ABC News that the treatment provided was just like that given to any Cuban; but Stossel's research led him to conclude that the hospital provided service only for the Cuban elite and that this care was not available to the average Cuban.\\"Healthy in Cuba, sick in America?\\", ABC News, 2007-09-07 In 2010, dissident Orlando Zapata died at the hospital after a hunger strike.

Working from everyday experience with subjects overlooked or considered delinquent, sordid and lowbrow, he reconnoiters notions and concepts on the outside fringes of South Africa's popular culture. Platter's work acts as a locus, documenting a dysfunctional contemporary reality. His work has been described as \\"unorthodox\\", \\"the delinquent love child of Quentin Tarantino and Dr Seuss\\" and where \\"the bizarreness of everyday life comes together in an expression unashamedly unforgiving, yet deeply observant\\".

He was Duke of Opava from 1433 until his death. From 1466, he was also a member of the cathedral chapter of Wroc≈Çaw. In older literature, he is sometimes confused with his nephew Przemko III.  Life  Przemko II's parents were Duke Przemko I of Opava and his third wife, Helena of Bosnia (who died on 2 March 1435). After Przemko I's death in 1433, his eldest son, Wenceslas II, took up the guardianship of his three younger half- brothers William, Ernest and Przemko II. His second-eldest, Nicholas IV, who had already reached adulthood, was given the Lordship of Zlat√© Hory. Although their father had stipulated in his will that his territory should not be fragmented further, the brothers nevertheless divided their inheritance in 1435. At the time, Przemko II was destined for a career in the clergy, and he probably received no territory in the 1435 division. Przemko II studied theology at the Universities of Krakow and Vienna. In Vienna, he wrote the astrological treatise . Around 1455, he returned to Wroc≈Çaw, where he had been a member of the cathedral chapter since 1446. In 1462, he was appointed provost of the Church of the Holy Cross in Wroc≈Çaw. In 1464 he got into a dispute with his nephew, John of Opava, about the ownership of Fulnek. In the same year, he had to give up his claim on a share of the Duchy of Opava, because King George of Bohemia had become the sole ruler of the Duchy. Przemko nevertheless continued to use the title Duke of Opava. Around 1465, he became a canon at Wroc≈Çaw. After Bishop Jo≈°t of Wroc≈Çaw died in 1467, Przemko served as diocesan administrator. Although he was considered a likely candidate to succeed Jo≈°t, the post was given to Rudolf of R√ºdesheim, who had previously served as papal legate for Germany and Bohemia. Przemko was a renowned scientist, educated in the fields of theology, astrology and alchemy. He died in 1478, unmarried, and was buried in the Church of the Holy Cross in Wroc≈Çaw. His tomb has been preserved to this day.  References  * Rudolf ≈Ω√°ƒçek: Dƒõjiny Slezska v datech, Prague, 2004, , p. 438 * Zdenƒõk Mƒõ≈ô√≠nsk√Ω: Margin√°lie k ≈æivotn√≠m osud≈Øm P≈ôremysla III.

It explores distant neighborhoods of the current incumbent solution, and moves from there to a new one if and only if an improvement was made. The local search method is applied repeatedly to get from solutions in the neighborhood to local optima. VNS was designed for approximating solutions of discrete and continuous optimization problems and according to these, it is aimed for solving linear program problems, integer program problems, mixed integer program problems, nonlinear program problems, etc.  Introduction  VNS systematically changes the neighborhood in two phases: firstly, descent to find a local optimum and finally, a perturbation phase to get out of the corresponding valley. Applications are rapidly increasing in number and pertain to many fields: location theory, cluster analysis, scheduling, vehicle routing, network design, lot-sizing, artificial intelligence, engineering, pooling problems, biology, phylogeny, reliability, geometry, telecommunication design, etc. There are several books important for understanding VNS, such as: Handbook of Metaheuristics, 2010, Handbook of Metaheuristics, 2003 and Search methodologies, 2005. Earlier work that motivated this approach can be found in # Davidon, W.C. # Fletcher, R., Powell, M.J.D. # Mladenoviƒá, N. and # Brimberg, J., Mladenoviƒá, N. Recent surveys on VNS methodology as well as numerous applications can be found in 4OR, 2008 and Annals of OR, 2010.  Definition of the problem  Define one deterministic optimization problem with \\\\min {\\\\\\\\{f (x)x \\\\in X, X \\\\subseteq S\\\\\\\\}} , (1) where S, X, x, and f are the solution space, the feasible set, a feasible solution, and a real-valued objective function, respectively. If S is a finite but large set, a combinatorial optimization problem is defined. If {S = R^{n}}, there is continuous optimization model. A solution {x^* \\\\in X} is optimal if {f (x^{*}) \\\\leq f (x), \\\\qquad \\\\forall{x}\\\\, \\\\in X} . Exact algorithm for problem (1) is to be found an optimal solution x*, with the validation of its optimal structure, or if it is unrealizable, in procedure have to be shown that there is no achievable solution, i.e., X =\\\\varnothing, or the solution is unbounded. CPU time has to be finite and short. For continuous optimization, it is reasonable to allow for some degree of tolerance, i.e., to stop when a feasible solution x^{*} has been found such that {f (x^{*}) \\\\leq f (x) + \\\\epsilon, \\\\qquad \\\\forall{x}\\\\, \\\\in X} or {(f (x^{*})- f (x))/ f (x^{*}) < \\\\epsilon , \\\\qquad \\\\forall{x}\\\\, \\\\in X} Some heuristics speedily accept an approximate solution, or optimal solution but one with no validation of its optimality. Some of them have an incorrect certificate, i.e., the solution x_h obtained satisfies {(f (x_{h})- f (x))/ f (x_{h}) \\\\leq \\\\epsilon , \\\\qquad \\\\forall{x}\\\\, \\\\in X} for some \\\\epsilon, though this is rarely small. Heuristics are faced with the problem of local optima as a result of avoiding boundless computing time. A local optimum x_L of problem is such that {f (x_{L}) \\\\leq f (x), \\\\qquad \\\\forall{x}\\\\, \\\\in N(x_{L}) \\\\cap X} where N(x_{L}) denotes a neighborhood of x_{L}  Description  According to (Mladenoviƒá, 1995), VNS is a metaheuristic which systematically performs the procedure of neighborhood change, both in descent to local minima and in escape from the valleys which contain them. VNS is built upon the following perceptions: # A local minimum with respect to one neighbourhood structure is not necessarily a local minimum for another neighbourhood structure. # A global minimum is a local minimum with respect to all possible neighborhood structures. # For many problems, local minima with respect to one or several neighborhoods are relatively close to each other. Unlike many other metaheuristics, the basic schemes of VNS and its extensions are simple and require few, and sometimes no parameters. Therefore, in addition to providing very good solutions, often in simpler ways than other methods, VNS gives insight into the reasons for such a performance, which, in turn, can lead to more efficient and sophisticated implementations. There are several papers where it could be studied among recently mentioned, such as (Hansen and Mladenoviƒá 1999, 2001a, 2003, 2005; Moreno-P√©rez et al.;) Local search A local search heuristic is performed through choosing an initial solution x, discovering a direction of descent from x, within a neighbourhood N(x), and proceeding to the minimum of f(x) within N(x) in the same direction. If there is no direction of descent, the heuristic stops; otherwise, it is iterated. Usually the highest direction of descent, also related to as best improvement, is used. This set of rules is summarized in Algorithm 1, where we assume that an initial solution x is given. The output consists of a local minimum, denoted by x', and its value. Observe that a neighbourhood structure N(x) is defined for all x ‚àà X. At each step, the neighbourhood N(x) of x is explored completely. As this may be timeconsuming, an alternative is to use the first descent heuristic. Vectors x^i \\\\in N(x) are then enumerated systematically and a move is made as soon as a direction for the descent is found. This is summarized in Algorithm 2. = Algorithm 1: Best improvement (highest descent) heuristic = Function BestImprovement(x) 1: repeat 2: x' ‚Üê x 3: x ‚Üê argmin_{f (y)}, y‚ààN(x) 4: until ( f (x) ‚â• f (x')) 5: return x' = Algorithm 2: First improvement (first descent) heuristic = Function FirstImprovement(x) 1: repeat 2: x' ‚Üê x; i‚Üê0 3: repeat 4: i ‚Üê i+1 5: x ‚Üê argmin{ f (x), f (x^i)}, x^i ‚àà N(x) 6: until ( f (x) < f (x^i) or i = N(x)) 7: until ( f (x) ‚â• f (x')) 8: return x' Let one denote \\\\mathcal{ N}_k(k=1, . . . ,k_{max}) , a finite set of pre- selected neighborhood structures, and with \\\\mathcal{N}_k(x) the set of solutions in the kth neighborhood of x. One will also use the notation \\\\mathcal{N'}_k(x), k = 1, . . . , k'_{max} when describing local descent. Neighborhoods \\\\mathcal{N}_k(x) or \\\\mathcal{N'}_k(x) may be induced from one or more metric (or quasi-metric) functions introduced into a solution space S. An optimal solution x_{opt} (or global minimum) is a feasible solution where a minimum of problem is reached. We call x' ‚àà X a local minimum of problem with respect to \\\\mathcal{N}_k(x) , if there is no solution x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N'}_k(x) \\\\subseteq X such that f (x) < f (x'). In order to solve problem by using several neighbourhoods, facts 1‚Äì3 can be used in three different ways: (i) deterministic; (ii) stochastic; (iii) both deterministic and stochastic. We first give in Algorithm 3 the steps of the neighbourhood change function which will be used later. Function NeighbourhoodChange() compares the new value f(x') with the incumbent value f(x) obtained in the neighbourhood k (line 1). If an improvement is obtained, k is returned to its initial value and the new incumbent updated (line 2). Otherwise, the next neighbourhood is considered (line 3). = Algorithm 3: ‚Äì Neighborhood change = Function NeighborhoodChange (x, x', k) 1: if f (x') < f(x) then 2: x ‚Üê x' // Make a move 3: k ‚Üê 1 // Initial neighborhood 4: else 5: k ‚Üê k+1 // Next neighborhood When VNS does not render a good solution, there are several steps which could be helped in process, such as comparing first and best improvement strategies in local search, reducing neighborhood, intensifying shaking, adopting VND, adopting FSS, and experimenting with parameter settings. The Basic VNS (BVNS) method (Handbook of Metaheuristics, 2010) combines deterministic and stochastic changes of neighbourhood. Its steps are given in Algorithm 4. Often successive neighbourhoods \\\\mathcal{N}_k will be nested. Observe that point x' is generated at random in Step 4 in order to avoid cycling, which might occur if a deterministic rule were applied. In Step 5, the best improvement local search (Algorithm 1) is usually adopted. However, it can be replaced with first improvement (Algorithm 2). = Algorithm 4: Basic VNS = Function VNS (x, kmax, tmax ); 1: repeat 2: k ‚Üê 1; 3: repeat 4: x' ‚Üê Shake(x, k) /* Shaking */; 5: x ‚Üê BestImprovement(x' ) /* Local search */; 6: x ‚Üê NeighbourhoodChange(x, x, k) /* Change neighbourhood */; 7: until k = kmax ; 8: t ‚Üê CpuTime() 9: until t > tmax ; = VNS variants = The basic VNS is a best improvement descent method with randomization. Without much additional effort, it can be transformed into a descent-ascent method: in NeighbourhoodChange() function, replace also x by x\\" with some probability, even if the solution is worse than the incumbent. It can also be changed into a first improvement method. Another variant of the basic VNS can be to find a solution x' in the ‚ÄúShaking‚Äù step as the best among b (a parameter) randomly generated solutions from the kth neighbourhood. There are two possible variants of this extension: (1) to perform only one local search from the best among b points; (2) to perform all b local searches and then choose the best. In paper (Fleszar and Hindi) could be found algorithm.  Extensions  * VND :The variable neighborhood descent (VND) method is obtained if a change of neighborhoods is performed in a deterministic way. In the descriptions of its algorithms, we assume that an initial solution x is given. Most local search heuristics in their descent phase use very few neighbourhoods. The final solution should be a local minimum with respect to all k_{max} neighbourhoods; hence the chances to reach a global one are larger when using VND than with a single neighbourhood structure. * RVNS :The reduced VNS (RVNS) method is obtained if random points are selected from \\\\mathcal{N}_k(x) and no descent is made. Rather, the values of these new points are compared with that of the incumbent and an update takes place in case of improvement. It is assumed that a stopping condition has been chosen like the maximum CPU time allowed t_{max} or the maximum number of iterations between two improvements. :To simplify the description of the algorithms it is used t_{max} below. Therefore, RVNS uses two parameters: t_{max} and k_{max}. RVNS is useful in very large instances, for which local search is costly. It has been observed that the best value for the parameter k_max is often 2. In addition, the maximum number of iterations between two improvements is usually used as a stopping condition. :RVNS is akin to a Monte-Carlo method, but is more systematic. * Skewed VNS :The skewed VNS (SVNS) method (Hansen et al.) addresses the :problem of exploring valleys far from the incumbent solution. Indeed, once the best solution in a large region has been found, it is necessary to :go some way to obtain an improved one. Solutions drawn at random in distant neighbourhoods may differ substantially from the incumbent and VNS :can then degenerate, to some extent, into the Multistart heuristic (in which descents are made iteratively from solutions generated at random, a :heuristic which is known not to be very efficient). Consequently, some compensation for distance from the incumbent must be made. * Variable Neighbourhood Decomposition Search :The variable neighbourhood decomposition search (VNDS) method (Hansen et al.) extends the basic VNS into a two-level VNS scheme based upon :decomposition of the problem. For ease of presentation, but without loss of generality, it is assumed that the solution x represents the set of :some elements. * Parallel VNS :Several ways of parallelizing VNS have recently been proposed for solving the p-Median problem. In Garc√≠a-L√≥pez et al.: three of them :are tested: (i) parallelize local search; (ii) augment the number of solutions drawn from the current neighbourhood and make a :local search in :parallel from each of them and (iii) do the same as (ii) but update the information about the best solution found. Three Parallel :VNS strategies :are also suggested for solving the Travelling purchaser problem in Ochi et al. * Primal-dual VNS :For most modern heuristics, the difference in value between the optimal solution and the obtained one is completely unknown. Guaranteed :performance of the primal heuristic may be determined if a lower bound on the objective function value is known. To :this end, the standard approach is to relax the integrality condition on the primal variables, based on a mathematical programming formulation of :the problem. :However, when the dimension of the problem is large, even the relaxed problem may be impossible to solve exactly by standard :commercial solvers. :Therefore, it seems a good idea to solve dual relaxed problems heuristically as well. It was obtained guaranteed bounds on :the primal heuristics :performance. In Primal-dual VNS (PD-VNS) (Hansen et al.) one :possible general way to attain both the guaranteed bounds and the exact solution is proposed. * Variable Neighborhood Branching.) :The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a linear function, subject to equality or inequality :constraints, and integrality restrictions on some of the variables. * Variable Neighborhood Formulation Space Search .) :FSS is method which is very useful because, one problem could be defined in addition formulations and moving through formulations is legitimate. :It is proved that local search works within formulations, implying a final solution when started from some initial solution in first formulation. :Local search systematically alternates between different formulations which was investigated for circle packing :problem (CPP) where stationary point for a nonlinear programming formulation of CPP in Cartesian coordinates is not strictly a stationary point in polar coordinates.  Applications  Applications of VNS, or of varieties of VNS are very abundant and numerous. Some fields where it could be found collections of scientific papers: * Industrial applications * Design problems in communication * Location problems * Data mining * Graph problems * Knapsack and packing problems * Mixed integer problems * Time tabling * Scheduling * Vehicle routing problems * Arc routing and waste collection * Fleet sheet problems * Extended vehicle routing problems * Problems in biosciences and chemistry * Continuous optimization * Other optimization problems * Discovery science  Conclusion  VNS implies several features which are presented in Hansen and Mladenoviƒá and some are presented here: # Simplicity: VNS is simple, clear and universally applicable # Precision: VNS is formulated in precise mathematical definitions # Coherence: all actions of the heuristics for solving problems follow from the VNS principles # Effectiveness: VNS supplies optimal or near-optimal solutions for all or at least most realistic instances # Efficiency: VNS takes a moderate computing time to generate optimal or near-optimal solutions # Robustness: the functioning of the VNS is coherent over a variety of instances # User friendliness: VNS has no parameters, so it is easy for understanding, expressing and using # Innovation: VNS is generating new types of application # Generality: VNS is inducing to good results for a wide variety of problems # Interactivity: VNS allows the user to incorporate his knowledge to improve the resolution process # Multiplicity: VNS is able to produce a certain near-optimal solutions from which the user can choose; Interest in VNS is growing quickly, evidenced by the increasing number of papers published each year on this topic (10 years ago, only a few; 5 years ago, about a dozen; and about 50 in 2007). Moreover, the 18th EURO mini-conference held in Tenerife in November 2005 was entirely devoted to VNS. It led to special issues of IMA Journal of Management Mathematics in 2007, European Journal of Operational Research (http://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-journal-of-operational-research/), and Journal of Heuristics (https://www.springer.com/mathematics/applications/journal/10732/) in 2008.

He's also the inventor of Avaz, India's first Augmentative and Alternative Communication device for children with disabilities. He is a TR35 awardee (2011) and an awardee of the National Award for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities by the President of India (2010).  Early life and education  Ajit grew up in Chennai, India and showed an early aptitude for language and mathematics. He went on to study electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras). During his graduation, he received the Motorola Prize for his academic and extra-curricular activities.http://www.iitm.ac.in/studentawards During his time at IIT Madras, he was a part of the Institute quiz team, notably captaining the team that won the University Challenge in 2003, and editing the IIT Madras campus magazine, The Fourth Estate. Ajit subsequently moved to the United States, working for several years at American Megatrends.  FreeSpeech  In February 2013, Ajit gave a TED talk on a new linguistic structure called FreeSpeech, and an algorithm called the FreeSpeech engine. FreeSpeech was created in response to a need felt among children with complex communication needs to communicate in multiple languages. FreeSpeech is a semantic map of pictures that represent words. These words are linked together in pairs of question/answer relationships, and have pictorial markers for tense, number etc. applied on top of them. The structure's stated aim was to capture 'meaning' rather than 'surface form' of language, and then use a set of algorithms (the FreeSpeech engine) to generate grammatical English out of it. FreeSpeech is language-independent, meaning it uses pictures of objects, actions, and even abstract ideas like the past tense, instead of English words like \\"I\\" or \\"eat\\". Some shown on the TED talk include a bowl of soup, a person talking, and a small clock with an arrow pointing backward to signify the past tense of a verb. FreeSpeech was tested widely among children with special needs such as autism and language impairments, to teach them grammar. It also saw use by children in the Deaf community to learn literacy‚Äîa task complicated by the unique grammatical structure of American Sign Language, which is very different from English. Beyond applications in disability, the Indian government was in talks to license this program to use in some of its schools to teach English, through the Aakash tablet project.  Avaz  In 2010, Ajit invented Avaz. Avaz is an Alternative and augmentative communication device. It works by generating speech from limited muscle movements like that from the head or hand, and is used people with speech disorders such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and aphasia. Avaz was widely used in India as a communication device, and was subsequently converted into an app for the iPad and for Android tablets. For his invention of Avaz, Ajit received the National Award for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities in 2010, from the President of India.  MIT TR35  In 2011, Ajit was named the MIT TR35 \\"Innovator of the Year\\" for India. His citation for the award mentioned his work on low-cost speech generating devices: > There are an estimated 10 million people in India who suffer from speech > impediments. They may not have speech but they have a lot to say. And they > can benefit from Narayanan's device. Avaz is a communication device for > people with speech disorders such as cerebral palsy, autism, mental > retardation, and aphasia. It works by converting limited muscle movements, > such as head or finger movements, into speech. His invention broadly falls > under the category of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) > technologies. Though speech generating devices are effective, most AAC > devices aren't within the reach of the speech-impaired persons in the > developing world and they mostly generate speech in English. This is another > deterrent which has prevented these devices from becoming as popular in the > developing world. Narayanan's innovation lies in bringing down the cost of > the device to one-tenth of the price of similar devices, making it > affordable to a wide swath of the Indian disabled population, and making it > available in Indian languages. In 2012, Ajit was named to the global MIT TR35 list, alongside Groupon founder Andrew Mason and Microsoft Photosynth inventor Noah Snavely: > Narayanan's Invention Labs, based in Chennai, designed Avaz to be not only > cheap but also capable of supporting multiple languages. \\"The average young > person in India speaks and uses three different languages every day,\\" > Narayanan points out. By working directly with Asian hardware manufacturers, > he has been able to bring the cost of an Avaz down to around $800, compared > with $5,000 to $10,000 for a single-language device in the United States.

Jointly established by New York University and East China Normal University with the support of the city of Shanghai and the district of Pudong in 2012, it was the first American college to receive independent registration status from China's Ministry of Education. While classes are in English, some proficiency in Chinese is required for graduation. Upon graduation, students will received a bachelor degree conferred by New York University - the same degree awarded at the New York campus - as well as a Chinese diploma recognized by the Chinese government. Students are required to study away at one of NYU's 12 Global Academic Centers and 2 degree-granting campuses, including the New York campus, in order to \\" foster cross-cultural understanding and communication\\".  History  The school opened to students in September 2013. Of the class of 294 students, 51% came from The People's Republic of China, with the remaining 49% coming from other countries around the world. During the 2013‚Äì2014 academic year, NYU Shanghai students studied at East China Normal University while the official NYU campus in Pudong was built.

When the theatre was founded in 1887, it was originally meant as a permanent circus building. Currently, it is mainly used for musicals, cabaret performances and pop concerts. Carr√© is located next to the Amstel, close to Waterlooplein. Its address is Amstel 115.  History  Carr√© is closely connected to the family Carr√©. This family group gave their first performances by the end of the 18th century and in 1863 they came to the Netherlands for the first time. In 1866 the German circus director finally got permission to build his first stone theatre, replacing the Rooseboom windmill on the Onbekendegracht canal. On 3 December 1887 this building was officially opened. In the beginning, it was just a wooden building with a stone fa√ßade. It was immediately a big success. At first Carr√© was only used during the winter, the winter circus of Oscar Carr√© then performed but during the rest of the year this group travelled and the theatre was empty. However, in 1893 the theatre was rented by Dutch theatre producer Frits van Haarlem for his vaudeville shows in the summer, which meant that there were performances during the entire year. The shows became very successful, thus changing the circus building to a theatre for all forms of popular entertainment. Carr√© turned form a circus into a vari√©t√© theatre (Dutch version of a Music Hall). After the death of Oscar Carr√© in 1911 the theatre had a bad period. No profits were made even though several directors tried new things. Max Gabri√´l rebuilt the theatre, but this didn't work so he left only a year later. Boekholt brought a new program and new sorts of amusements, but this didn't work either. A business company whom brought back the circus entertainment went bankrupt. In 1920, it changed its name to Theater Carr√©.Free Amsterdam, Royal Theatre Carr√© Finally (in 1924) two gentlemen named Benjamin and Content were able to make a profit with Carr√©. After Benjamin and Content, Alex Wunnink became the director. He was successful and brought many new shows, as well as a big profit. So, throughout the early 20th century the building was mainly used for vaudeville and revue shows, occasionally Italian operas and operettas. Dutch stars like Lou Bandy and Louis Davids and international celebrities like Josephine Baker and the clown Grock performed here. Amsterdam Sights, Royal Theatre Carre During the second world war Carr√© attracted more people, because people were searching for distraction. But because of the razia's (police raids) in 1944, people started to stay away and the doors were closed from 1944 till 1945. After the Second World War, revues and winter circuses remained popular. In 1956, Carr√© introduced musical theatre to the Netherlands with Porgy and Bess. The one-man show followed in 1963, when Toon Hermans gave his first solo cabaret show. After the death of Alex Wunnik his son Karel Wunnik became the new director. Under Karel Wunnik the theatre had serious problems. In 1968 Carr√© was bought with the intention to break it down and build a hotel on its place. After protests from artists, the municipality of Amsterdam finally refused permission for demolition. That's when the municipality of Amsterdam got involved. They made a new destination plan, and two years later it got a monumental status to protect the theatre. In 1974 Guus Osters became the new director, but he had difficulties attracting public. He had to take some serious measures but eventually a couple of new (and very successful) shows saved him and Carr√©. In 1977 the municipality bought the building. In 1987, at the centenary, the Royal Predicate was granted and the name was changed to Koninklijk Theater Carr√©. In 2004, the theatre was completely renovated. The historic fa√ßade and interior design have been retained.  The theatre nowadays  The Royal Theater Carr√© nowadays is still being used for show and performances. There's a big offer of shows like musical, dance, cabaret, stand up comedian, opera, operetta, theatre shows, classical concerts, pop concerts, poetry etc. Many national and international popular artists perform on a regular base at Carr√©. In the lobby several statues have been placed. These statues depict famous Dutch artists that have performed at Carr√©, like Toon Hermans, Jos Brink, Youp van 't Hek, Tineke Schouten and Andr√© van Duin. On occasion, famous Dutch performers who have died, are lying in repose in the theatre so members of the public can pay their respect (Ramses Shaffy, Jos Brink).

Research Foci  Perfusion Imaging: Arno Villringer pioneered magnetic resonance perfusion imaging of the brain by demonstrating that susceptibility contrast agents such as GdDTPA may be employed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Villringer et al. 1988). The susceptibility-based contrast mechanism later became relevant for the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Optical Imaging: In 1993, Villringer showed feasibility of noninvasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging (fNIRS, fNIRI) of the human brain (Villringer al. 1993, Villringer and Chance 1997) followed by >50 publications establishing /validating fNIRS. Physiology empowered brain imaging: Since 1992 his research focus has been on neurophysiological mechanisms underlying brain function and plasticity, using multimodal brain imaging, e.g., signatures of neuronal inhibition in functional brain imaging (Wenzel et al. 2000, Blankenburg et al. 2003), combined fNIRS / fMRI to establish relationship between BOLD and deoxy-Hb concentration in fMRI (Kleinschmidt et al. 1996), combined EEG / fMRI to show fMRI correlates of background rhythms (Moosmann et al. 2003, Ritter et al. 2009) and simultaneously assess neuronal spiking and fMRI (Ritter et al. 2008). Brain plasticity, development of vascular risk factors, stroke: Villringer currently pursues the hypothesis that (maladaptive) brain plasticity is crucial for the development of vascular risk factors leading to stroke and for the (lack of) recovery after stroke, and that brain plasticity can be beneficially modified. For this purpose, he employs multimodal brain imaging to understand basic neurophysiological mechanisms underlying human brain plasticity in cortical and subcortical brain areas, and their interaction. Behavioral correlates include sensorimotor function, reaction to stress, and emotions. The clinical applications are (i) prevention of vascular risk factors (obesity, hypertension) and subsequent stroke, and (ii) recovery after stroke. Arno Villringer is the author of approximately 250 academic articles (as of 2012).

It is situated south of the River Clyde and is part of the former Burgh of Govan. The 80-acre Craigiehall estate, previously three smaller properties, was bought in 1783 by John Robertson, a cashier in the Glasgow Arms Bank, who with his brothers owned cotton and sugar plantations in the West Indies. He renamed it Plantation, not as is commonly thought as a reminder of the West Indies plantations, but in recognition of an earlier name for Sir John Maxwell's estate, which in 1741 included the whole of the Kinning Park area right up to the riverbank, including a number of fields called Plantation, totaling about 46 acres. It then, in 1793, passed to John Mair (d. 1867), a merchant who developed the building and gardens. Plantation passed to the Maclean family, The Macleans of Plantation, in 1829, in the person of William Maclean (1783-1867), a Glasgow Baillie. In the years that followed, the estate was bisected by the railway to the south, with the shipbuilding yards of The Clyde Trust cutting off the estate from the river. Tenement housing was built and the house demolished in about 1900. Plantation Quay formed part of the site for the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 and subsequent Glasgow Science Centre. Before demolition of the 19th century tenements in the 1970s, Plantation's streets included Lorne Street, MacLean Street, Blackburn Street, Plantation Street, Eaglesham Street, Mair Street, Craigiehall Street and Rutland Crescent; parts of Paisley Road West and Govan Road are also part of the district. The main primary school is Lorne Street Primary School. Other points of interest are the local Church of Scotland and Harper Memorial Baptist Church, named for John Harper the first pastor, who died in the Titanic disaster. Today, Plantation is where all the major roads join around the Tradeston area and where the M8 meets the junction of the M77 and the M74.

Her work spans social documentary photography, visual arts, and collaborative art projects.  Education  Hannelie Coetzee matriculated from Estcourt high School in 1989. Coetzee received a BTech degree in photography from the Vaal University of Technology (1990‚Äì1994) and an Advanced Diploma in Fine Arts at Witwatersrand University from the Wits Fine Arts Department (1996‚Äì1997).  Work  Coetzee has worked as a photographer for more than twenty years, specializing in social documentary photography. She has worked alongside Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) as well as corporate companies to capture their social investment and development projects. She is represented by Aurora Photos in New York. In March 2002, Coetzee launched her first solo exhibition, the Bossie Series at the Bell-Roberts Photographic Gallery in Cape Town. ArtsLink commented that \\"Even though this series can be described as traditional photography, Hannelie Coetzee has put her own spin on things...She creates a sensual, almost velvet surface that challenges conventional photography.\\" In November 2009, Coetzee won a PPC Young Concrete Sculptor merit award for her piece \\"Webcam Two Faces,\\" a pixelated webcam self-portrait rendered in a mix of concrete and stone. The judges found it \\"exceptionally interesting.\\" Recently, Coetzee has been working with discarded/processed stone. She began by photographing stone and then transitioned into collecting stone, making stone mosaics, and ultimately creating stone sculptures. Collecting, rearranging and documenting stone out of place has become a theme in her work for the past 10 years. As well as various site specific works around South Africa, such as Infecting the City and the Site Specific Land Arts festival, Coetzee has done several works in Johannesburg to reconnect with her roots in the city. A large commissioned work made of mining core, ‚ÄúThe Change Agent‚Äù, was unveiled in February 2012 in the Maboneng Precinct on the facade of a new building, The Main Change. In March 2012, Coetzee created a temporary piece titled \\"Buigkrag\\" at the Nirox Sculpture Park in Gauteng dealing with our relationship to energy. It is now a part of the Nirox permanent collection. Coetzee collaborates with Usha Seejarim on Such Initiative, a Section 21 Company established in 2009 and an eco-conscious public arts organization.

He was Landeshauptmann and later pledge lord of the County of Kladsko and the Duchies of ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie and M√ºnsterberg.  Life  His parents were P≈Øta II of ƒåastolovice and Anna, a daughter of Duke Jan II of O≈õwiƒôcim. Like his father, he owned the Lordship of ƒåastolovice and other territories in eastern Bohemia. P≈Øta was initially a supporter of the Hussites, but soon turned into one of their fiercest opponents. Probably because of the zeal he distinguished himself with in this war, King Sigismund of Bohemia appointed him in 1422 as royal governor of the County of Kladsko and the district of ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie. In 1424, P≈Øta concluded an alliance with Duke John I of M√ºnsterberg against the Hussites. This was probably the reason why the Hussites attacked Kladsko and Silesia in December 1425. In 1426, Sigismund sold the mint right in Kladsko to P≈Øta. In 1427, P≈Øta fought with a Silesian army in eastern Bohemia against the Hussites. In 1428, P≈Øta fought in the battle of Stary Wielis≈Çaw, where Duke John I was killed. M√ºnsterberg fell as a completed fief to King Sigismund, who mortgaged it to P≈Øta on 13 August 1429. In 1431, he also mortgaged the County of Kladsko and the district of ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie to him. In 1434, he enfeoffed him with the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg. P≈Øta carried out several diplomatic missions for King Sigismund. Shortly before his death, he accompanied envoys from the Council of Basel to Sigismund's court. P≈Øta's political aim was to create a territory for his family on both sides of the border between Silesia and eastern Bohemia. In 1396, he married Anna of Koldice (d. 1467), a daughter of governor Albert of the Duchy of Jawor. This marriage created favourable conditions for his goal. P≈Øta III died in 1434 without a male heir.

He was reelected at the annual general meeting of the AICU held in Mangalore in September 2010. Denis holds M.Sc. Ph.D. and D.Sc degrees, and was a professor in the Department of Mathematics at Gorakhpur University in Uttar Pradesh. In the 1980s, Denis was a member of the Uttar Pradesh Minorities Commission. Denis has taken a somewhat radical position in saying that the clergy should confine itself to ministering to the spiritual needs of the people. Administration of the material goods of the church should be left entirely to the laity. At a seminar in Goa in August 2009, former Union minister Eduardo Faleiro said that church property should be brought under the ambit of state laws, as was the case with other religions. This was endorsed by Denis and other liberals. However John Dayal, representing the conservatives in the AICU, opposed any change. He said that the \\"Christian situation\\" was radically and materially different from that of the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh religions, and existing laws were sufficient. In February 2012 the AICU announced that it had started planning for a Laity Synod, to be held later in the year. This would be the first time such an event had been arranged in India. It would give the lay members an opportunity to think about their role in the church and the future of the church. According to Denis \\"The Second Vatican Council called for the empowerment of the laity. But after 50 years, there is not much to show\\". It was hoped that the synod would help find ways for the laity to become more involved in management of the financial and temporal affairs of the church.

Diptera, which are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth, are very diverse biologically. None are truly marine but they occupy virtually every terrestrial niche. Many have co-evolved in association with plants and animals. The Diptera are a very significant group in the decomposition and degeneration of plant and animal matter, are instrumental in the breakdown and release of nutrients back into the soil, and whose larvae supplement the diet of higher agrarian organisms. They are also an important component in food chains. The applied significance of the Diptera is as disease vectors, as agricultural pests, as pollinators and as biological control agents. Habitats Diptera occur all over the world except in regions with permanent ice-cover. They are found in most land biomes (all 14 WWF major habitat types) including deserts and the tundra. Insects are the most diverse group of Arctic animals (about 3,300species), of which about 50% are Diptera. Palearctic habitats include meadows, prairies, mountain passes, forests, desert oases, seashores, sandy beaches, coastal lagoons, lakes, streams and rivers, bogs, fens, areas (including waters polluted by rotting waste, industrial emissions), urban areas, cattle, horse and poultry farms. =Cave Diptera= see also List of fauna of Batu Caves The Diptera fauna of caves includes species in Sphaeroceridae, Mycetophilidae, Psychodidae, Phoridae, Tipulidae, Trichoceridae, Heleomyzidae, Mycetophilidae and Culicidae. The main sources of food for cave Diptera are other insects, carrion and guano. Most are perhaps only troglophiles.Ren√© Jeannel, 1940 Faune cavernicole de la France (The Fauna of the Caves of France) =Desert Diptera= Desert diptera include specialised species of Psychodidae, Nemestrinidae, Therevidae, Scenopinidae and Bombyliidae. These groups are most diverse where dry sandy soils provide a suitable habitat for the larvae. =Freshwater Diptera= Larval stages of Diptera can be found in almost any aquatic or semiaquatic habitat They form an important fraction of the macro zoobenthos of most freshwater ecosystems. families are Chironomidae (very significant), Stratiomyidae, Ephydridae, Dixidae and Tipulidae. Feeding Food habits of most species are largely unknown but broad statements may be made. Diptera are important pollinators and plant pests. =Detritivores= Many Diptera are detritivores. Typical are Dryomyza anilis and, notably, Musca domestica. =Flower feeders= Many adult Brachycera feed on flowers notably Syrphidae which obtain all their protein requirements by feeding on pollen. The Calyptratae exhibit flower feeding in all families except Hippoboscidae Nycterebidae and Glossinidae and in the Acalyptratae the Conopidae are well known flower feeders. Other flower feeding Brachycerous families are Empididae, Stratiomyidae and the Acroceridae like various members of the Nemestrinidae, Bombyliidae and Tabanidae are nectar feeders with exceptionally long proboscises, sometimes longer than the entire bodily length of the insect. Flower feeding Nematocera include Bibionidae and some species in Tipulidae and other families.Willemstein, S.C. 1987. An evolutionary basis for pollination ecology.

The most important function of blood meals is to obtain proteins as materials for egg production. For females to risk their lives on blood sucking while males abstain, is not a strategy limited to the mosquitoes; it also occurs in some other families, such as the Tabanidae. Most female horse flies feed on mammal blood, but some species are known to feed on birds, amphibians or reptiles. Other bloodfeeding Diptera are Ceratopogonidae Phlebotominae Hippoboscidae, Hydrotaea and Philornis downsi (Muscidae), Spaniopsis and Symphoromyia Rhagionidae. There are no known acalyptrates that are obligate blood-feeders.

Larval Diptera feed in leaf-litter, in leaves, stems, roots, flower and seed heads of plants, moss, fungi, rotting wood, rotting fruit or other organic matter such as slime, flowing sap, and rotting cacti, carrion, dung, detritus in mammal bird or wasp nests, fine organic material including insect frass and micro-organisms. Many Diptera larvae are predatory, sometimes on the larvae of other Diptera. Many Agromyzidae are leaf miners. Some Tephritidae are leaf miners or gall formers. The larvae of all Oestridae oestrids are obligate parasites of mammals. (Oestridae include the highest proportion of species whose larvae live as obligate parasites within the bodies of mammals. Most other species prone to cause myiasis are members of related families, such as the Calliphoridae. There are roughly 150 known species worldwide.) Tachinidae larvae are parasitic on other insects. Conopidae larvae are endoparasites of bees and wasps or of cockroaches and calyptrate Diptera, Pyrgotidae larvae are endoparasites of adult scarab beetles. Sciomyzidae larvae are exclusively associated with freshwater and terrestrial snails, or slugs. They feed on snails as predators, parasitoids, or scavengers. Females search out snails for oviposition. Known Odiniidae larvae live in the tunnels of wood-boring larvae of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and other Diptera and function as scavengers or predators of the host larvae. Oedoparena larvae feed on barnacles. The larvae of Acroceridae and some Bombyliidae are hypermetamorphic.

Ant associates Stylogastrines are obligate associates of some Orthoptera, other Diptera and ants. These flies typically use army ants' raiding columns to flush out their prey, ground-dwelling Orthoptera. Many species of Phoridae are specialist parasitoids of ants, but there are also species in the tropics that are parasitoids of stingless bees. These affected bees are often host to more than one fly larva and some individuals have been found to contain 12 phorid larvae. The subfamily Microdontinae contains slightly more than 400 species of hoverflies (family Syrphidae) and, while diverse, these species share several characteristics by which they differ from other syrphids. The Microdontinae are myrmecophiles, meaning they live in the nests of ants. Larval Microdontinae are scavengers or predators in ant nests. Adults of many species of the genus Bengalia are kleptoparasitic on ants and will snatch food and pupae being carried by ants or feed on winged termites.B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, The Ants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1990.B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, Journey to the Ants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1994. Swarms Swarm-based mating systems typically involve males flying in swarms to attract patrolling females. Such swarms are often of immense size. Smaller swarms may be around a fixed point called a swarm marker. Swarming occurs in Chironomidae, Bibionidae, Platypezidae, Limoniidae, Thaumatomyia notata, Sepsis fulgens, Bibionidae, Platypezidae, Fanniidae, Coelopidae, Milichiidae and Trichoceridae. Chaoboridae form larval as well as adult swarms. Image:TrichoceridaeSwarm.jpgSwarm of Trichoceridae (visible at full resolution). The tree bough is the swarm marker. Image:Swarm of Chironomidae - geograph.org.uk - 563856.jpg Swarm of Chironomidae Image:Kihulased.jpgSwarm of Simuliidae - mating occurs on the wing when males form small swarms around visual markers which may be located up to 200 m from the breeding site. Mimicry Many Diptera are mimetic. An instance is Syrphidae often are brightly coloured, with spots, stripes, and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies. Due to this colouring, and sometimes behaviour patterns, they are often mistaken for wasps or bees; they exhibit Batesian mimicry. The wing pattern of the sciomyzidTrypetoptera punctulata is very similar to some Tephritidae, and might, in fact, mimic the colour pattern of some spidersPreston-Mafham, Rod; Ken Preston-Mafham (1993). The encyclopedia of land invertebrate behaviour. MIT Press. There are several fly species that look like an ant. At least one species from the little studied Richardiidae genus Sepsisoma mimic ants, particularly the formicine ant Camponotus crassus. Several species of Micropezidae (stilt-legged flies) resemble ants (especially the wingless, haltere-less Badisis ambulans), as do species in the genus Strongylophthalmyia and Syringogaster..Mydidae are mimics of stinging Hymenoptera.

Phytalmia mouldsi uses a resource defense mating system. Deuterophlebia males have extremely long antennae which they employ when contesting territories over running water, waiting for females to hatch. Families of acalyptrate flies exhibiting morphological development associated with agonistic behaviour include: Clusiidae, Diopsidae, Drosophilidae, Platystomatidae, Tephritidae and Ulidiidae.

Image:Palloptera saltuum.jpgPalloptera saltuum: Pallopteridae vibrate their wings during courtship and make robotic movements. Bioluminescence Around a dozen Keroplatidae species and Orfelia fultoni are unique among flies in displaying bioluminescence. In some species this is restricted to the larval stage but in others this feature is retained by the pupae and adults. It has been suggested that the ability to produce their own light is used by some predatory larvae as a lure for potential prey, although it also obviously makes themselves more susceptible to predation or parasitism.Viviani V.R., Hastings J.W., Wilson T (2002) Two bioluminescent diptera: the North American Orfelia fultoni and the Australian Arachnocampa flava.

A prominent specialist in the study of early texts, bibliographer and scholar. Born to a family of a Russian orthodox priest in January 1737 in Tula province, the Russian Empire. In 1750 Damaskin joined the Kolomna seminary and then in 1752 the Moscow clerical academy. Upon graduation in 1761 he was appointed a tutor into the Kolomna seminary. In 1765 he submitted a petition to continue education in England. In 1766, he was among four students of the Moscow clerical academy Damaskin and was sent to study at the University of G√∂ttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany till 1772 when he returned to Russia. In December 1774, he was appointed to the position of tutor in the Slavic Greek Latin Academy in Moscow. Since 1775 Damaskin is the prefect and professor of philosophy at the academy. On 8 September 1775 he took monastic vows. In April 1778, he was promoted to be the archimandrite of the Epiphany Monastery in Moscow and on 24 May 1778 was appointed rector of the Slavic Greek Latin Academy. Is renowned for introducing significant improvements in the way of tutoring, deliberation of the study process from scholasticism, widening of the library and introduction of solemn assembly and public debate at the academy. Since 19 April 1779, he is a member of the Moscow Synodal Office. Since 1780 Damaskin is a superintendent of ecclesiastical printing. He also participated in the Free Russian Assembly, established at the Moscow State University. –û–Ω 5 May 1782, archimandrite Damaskin was appointed bishop of Sevsk, a vicar of the diocese of Moscow that soon was followed by ordination of him on 5 July. Being the bishop of Sevsk, Damaskin was able to improve deanery accounting, elevate sermon and introduce some improvements in the choir. On 22 September 1783, he moved to Nizhny Novgorod. Education was the top priority for bishop Damaskin, he cultivated affinity to science among priesthood and used it as the main criteria while appointing new priests within the diocese. He is also known for putting in order local theological seminaries, expanding of teaching of theology, introducing of study of some local languages and extending the libraries. He was so devoted to science so requested for a number of times from his superiors and even from metropolite Gabriel (Petrov) of St Petersburg to be released of his duty to be able to focus entirely on studying and science. On 2 January 1794, he was retired and spent the rest of his life at the Intercession (Pokrovsky) Monastery of Moscow where he died on 18 December 1795. For sparse but valuable academic works of his Damaskin was affiliated to the University of G√∂ttingen as well as become a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. His works are mostly related to linguistics, theology, antique literature and translation to German and Latin. He also composed a dictionary of various languages of peoples populating Nizhny Novgorod province like Tatars, Chuvash, Mordvinians and Cheremis.

Produced by Ridley Scott and Leonardo DiCaprio, the film stars Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Sam Shepard. The film is about Pennsylvania steel mill worker Russell Baze (Bale), and his Iraq war veteran brother Rodney (Affleck) who cannot adjust to civilian life. Rodney makes money fighting bareknuckle for bar owner and small-time criminal John Petty (Dafoe), who runs illegal gambling operations, but becomes so indebted due to gambling losses that he begs Petty for a big money fight. After Petty reluctantly arranges this with a ruthless backwoods criminal gang, Rodney disappears and his brother tries to find out what has happened. The film received a limited release in Los Angeles and New York City on December 4, 2013, followed by a wide theatrical release on December 6. The film earned $15.7 million against its $22 million budget and it received mixed reviews. Plot After getting off work at a North Braddock, Pennsylvania steel mill, Russell Baze sees his brother, Rodney, at a horse racing simulcast, where Rodney had just bet on a losing horse. Rodney reveals he is betting with money lent by John Petty, who owns a bar and runs several illegal games. Russell visits Petty, pays off some of Rodney's debt, and promises to pay Petty the rest with his next paycheck if Rodney has not yet paid it off. Driving home intoxicated, Russell hits a car, killing its occupants including a little boy. He is incarcerated for vehicular manslaughter. While in prison, he is informed that his ailing father has died and his girlfriend Lena has left him for the small town police chief, Wesley Barnes. Upon his release from prison, Russell returns home and resumes his job. The same day, Rodney participates in an illegal bare-knuckle prizefight. Rodney was supposed to take a \\"dive\\" to repay some of the debt but becomes enraged at his opponent and defeats him. The next morning, Russell finds Rodney's bloodied knuckle tapes in the trash and confronts him about it. Russell wants him to work in the mill, but Rodney, a four-tour Iraq war veteran, is too mentally scarred for a regular job. Rodney tells Petty that these \\"nickel and dime\\" fights will never earn him enough to repay Petty. Rodney then insists that Petty organizes a more lucrative fight. Petty reluctantly arranges one with Harlan DeGroat, a sociopathic drug dealer from rural New Jersey to whom Petty is in debt. Meanwhile Russell wants his girlfriend back, but she is pregnant with Wesley's baby. Russell unsuccessfully feigns contentment to Lena, saying she will be a great mom: both know that her pregnancy makes their getting back together impossible. Rodney is told he must intentionally lose the New Jersey fight. When DeGroat seeks assurances Rodney will lose, Petty promises he will. Rodney knocks out his opponent, but after Petty pleads with him, he helps his opponent up, takes a dive, and lets the man pummel his face into a bloody mess. After the fight, DeGroat asks for the rest of his loan, but Petty reminds him they had agreed that this fight made them even, and DeGroat drops the subject. While driving back home, however, DeGroat and his men ambush Petty and Rodney. DeGroat first shoots and kills Petty, then has Rodney dragged into the woods and kills him, too. Unknown to anyone, Petty's cell phone had fallen out of his pocket onto the car seat, accidentally connecting to his bartender Dan's voicemail and recording DeGroat murdering Petty. That night, Russell finds a letter from Rodney, stating that this will be his last fight and that he wants to work with Russell at the mill. Wesley informs Russell about Rodney's disappearance, and Russell and his uncle, Red, set off to find him. In DeGroat's town, Russell and Red are stopped by a Bergen County deputy sheriff, who informs them that DeGroat's men would kill them if they knew why the two were in town, and, as a favor to Chief Barnes, he will escort them to the state line rather than searching and arresting them for illegally carrying concealed weapons. Upon returning to the mill, Wesley visits Russell and confirms Rodney's death. Russell goes to Petty's office, finds a phone number for DeGroat, and calls him without identifying himself, enticing him to come to collect Petty's debt. At the bar, Russell sabotages DeGroat's van to prevent his escape and confronts him. DeGroat escapes to a nearby shutdown mill, where Russell shoots him in the thigh. Russell then follows DeGroat to a field outside the mill as he hobbles off and shoots him in the back. Russell informs DeGroat that he is Rodney's brother, as Wesley approaches the field in a squad car. Wesley pleads for Russell to put down his gun, but Russell proceeds to carefully aim his hunting rifle and shoots DeGroat in the back of the head. The film cuts to a pensive Russell sitting at home at the dining table, suggesting that Wesley had arranged matters so that Russell avoided prison.

Director Scott Cooper read an article about Braddock, Pennsylvania, a declining steel industry town outside of Pittsburgh, and the efforts to revitalize it, led by mayor John Fetterman. After visiting, Cooper was inspired to use the borough as the backdrop for a film. Cooper developed the story from The Low Dweller, a spec script written by Brad Ingelsby that had actor Leonardo DiCaprio and director Ridley Scott attached. The studio offered the script to Cooper, which he rewrote, drawing on his experience of growing up in Appalachia and losing a sibling at a young age. DiCaprio and Scott stayed on as producers of the film. The story has no relation to Out of This Furnace, a 1941 historical novel by Thomas Bell, set in Braddock. The Hollywood Reporter reported the film's budget was $22 million. =Filming= Principal photography began in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area on April 13, 2012, and wrapped on June 1, 2012. The majority of filming took place in Braddock, and additional filming was in nearby North Braddock, Imperial, Rankin, and Swissvale. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi shot the feature in anamorphic format on Kodak 35mm film. Prison scenes were filmed in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia, at the former State Penitentiary in Moundsville. Filming also took place in rural Beaver County, including a deer hunting scene in Raccoon Creek State Park and a mill scene in Koppel. Independence Township doubled for Bergen County, New Jersey. The Carrie Furnace, an abandoned blast furnace near Braddock, served as the location for the film's finale. Christian Bale wore a tattoo of Braddock's ZIP code, 15104, on his neck as a homage to the town's mayor John Fetterman, who has the same design on his arm. =Music= The musical score to Out of the Furnace was composed by Dickon Hinchliffe. Originally, it was announced that Alberto Iglesias had reached an agreement to compose the score for the film. However, Hinchliffe later took over scoring duties. Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder re- recorded the song Release from Pearl Jam's debut album Ten for the film, which can be heard during the opening scenes and end credits. A soundtrack album featuring Hinchliffe's score was released digitally on December 3, 2013 by Relativity Music Group. Release The film premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on November 9, 2013 in Hollywood, California as part of the American Film Institute's AFI Fest. It received a limited release in Los Angeles and New York City on December 4, 2013, followed by a wide theatrical release in the U.S. on December 6. Director Scott Cooper won the award for best first or second film for Out of the Furnace at the 2013 Rome Film Festival. The Pearl Jam song \\"Release\\" is featured during the opening title and features in a newly recorded edition during the end credits. Reception =Box office= Out of the Furnace was the only new film to receive a wide release in the U.S. on December 6, 2013, and earned an estimated $1.8 million on its opening day. The film took in an estimated $5.3 million over its opening weekend. The film came in third behind the animated Disney film Frozen, which brought in $31.6 million, and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which had $27 million in ticket sales that weekend. Relativity Media had pre-sold the film to foreign distributors for $16 million, which offset its costs. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average approval rating of 54% based on 196 reviews and an average rating of 5.91/10. The general consensus for the site says: \\"While it may not make the most of its incredible cast, Out of the Furnace is still so packed with talent that it's hard to turn away.\\" The film holds a score of 63 (indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\") out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 40 critics. =Top ten lists= Despite its mixed critical reception, Out of the Furnace appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2013. * 2nd ‚Äì Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times * 2nd ‚Äì Clint O'Connor, Cleveland Plain Dealer * 4th ‚Äì Marc Doye, Metacritic * 6th ‚Äì Chris Nashawaty, Entertainment Weekly * 7th ‚Äì Kristopher Tapley, Hitfix =Lawsuit= Town officials from Mahwah, New Jersey, urged a boycott of the film due to negative depictions of the Ramapough Mountain Indians, an indigenous people living around the Ramapo Mountains. They characterized the film's portrayal of this group as a hate crime. Relativity Media responded that the film \\"is not based on any one person or group\\" and is \\"entirely fictional\\". Nine members of the group, eight of whom have the surname DeGroat, the same as the lead character, filed suit against the makers and other involved parties, claiming that Out of the Furnace portrays a gang of \\"inbreds\\" living in the Ramapo Mountains who are \\"lawless, drug-addicted, impoverished and violent.\\" The lawsuit asserts that \\"The Defendants, and each of them, knew or should have known that their actions would place Plaintiffs, and/or any person so situated in a false light.\\" The suit continues, \\"The connection between the ethnic slur of 'Jackson Whites', with the location of the Ramapo Mountains of New Jersey', with a Bergen County Police patrol car, with the surnames 'DeGroat' and 'Van Dunk', is too specific to the Ramapough plaintiffs to be chance, coincidence or happenstance, and implies an element of knowledge on the part of the Defendants, or some of them.\\" On May 16, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge William Walls, sitting in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the film did not refer directly to any of the plaintiffs.

It was released on April 16, 2012, and compiles remixes (on one CD/in one album download) by different artists of Battles' songs from Gloss Drop (2011), eleven of which were originally released over a series of four 12-inch singles. The CD (and MP3) compilation includes a remix of \\"Sundome\\" which was not included on any of the vinyl releases. The four 12\\" singles were numbered from 1 to 4, and were announced on Battles' website and Facebook page, and released from February (the first on February 6/7 internationally and in the US, respectively) to April 2012. The final part, Dross Glop 4, was released on Record Store Day 2012 (April 21), following the release of this compilation. The album title is a spoonerism of the title of the band's album Gloss Drop, which the original versions of the songs remixed are from. All four of the vinyl sleeves and the compilation's cover are also based on the initial art for Gloss Drop, intermixing different colored paints on the pink of the original sculpture. Reception Dross Glop received a score of 63/100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". musicOMH summarised that the album was \\"unchallenging territory\\" for the band, giving it three out of five stars. Slant Magazine's Kevin Liedel, in a two-out-of-five stars review, opined that \\"while the album's contributors lean in a well-intentioned direction, preferring organic, innovative methods over simply pasting some vocal lines and guitar riffs on top of standard, synth-driven BPMs, Dross Glop is, at best, uneven,\\" also calling it \\"scattershot, meandering, awkward, and often boring\\". PopMatters' John Garratt said, \\"The best remix albums can capture the listener's imagination and take it down bold new paths. But in this case, if you want bold imagination, you really should side with the original Gloss Drop.\\" More positive reviews came from such publications as Pitchfork, who awarded the album 7.8 out of 10, and acclaimed Hudson Mohawke's remix of \\"Rolls Bayce\\", calling it \\"an unexpectedly soft and emotive take from the Glasgow producer\\"; Kode9's remix of \\"Africastle\\", saying it is a \\"seven- minute, house-focused mini set of sorts, fizzing and grinding ominously before slamming into a kind of chiptune dancehall dance party\\"; and Qluster's \\"Dominican Fade\\", which \\"pairs prim horns with beautiful organ glimmers, sounding nothing like the source material but no worse for it.\\" Allmusic's Heather Phares gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, and said \\"Gang Gang Dance gives Gloss Drop single 'Ice Cream' one of the most playful and successful treatments, adding to it a futuristic Latin twist with dive-bombing bass, a low-rider beat, and chanting vocals,\\" also noting that \\"Like many remix collections, Dross Glop doesn't flow particularly well, and it's not quite as dazzling as Gloss Drop, but it once again shows that Battles are up for anything.\\" Track listing * These tracks were edited for the CD release, but are included on the vinyl formats in their original full-length forms. =Dross Glop 1= Released February 6, 2012 internationally and February 7 in the US. =Dross Glop 2= Released February 20, 2012 internationally and February 21 in the US. =Dross Glop 3= Released on March 19, 2012 internationally and March 20 in the US. =Dross Glop 4= Released April 21, 2012 (Record Store Day) in the US and internationally.

Muricholic acids differ from the primary bile acids found in humans, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, by having a hydroxyl group in the Œ≤-conformation at the 6-position. The orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 7 position defines Œ±- or Œ≤-muricholic acid. Muricholic acids are detectable at low concentrations in human urine. The three major bile acids in germ-free mice are cholic acid, Œ±-muricholic, and Œ≤-muricholic acids. In conventional mice with a normal microbiome, œâ-muricholic acid, and various sulfated forms are also found. Conjugation with taurine (to give tauromuricholic acids which are the main forms), or with glycine (to give glycomuricholic acids) takes place in the liver before secretion. The enzyme responsible for the 6-hydroxylation reactions forming muricholates in rodents is the cytochrome P450 Cyp2c70. This produces Œ±-muricholic acid from chenodeoxycholic acid, and Œ≤-muricholic acid from ursodeoxycholic acid. Tauromuricholic acids were shown to be potent antagonists of the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR).

The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 3 station. Leimbach Park and the Wiesloch Feldbahn and Industrial Museum are located to the north of the station, with the headquarters of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen and SAP SE on the south-western side. History =19th century= The Karlsruhe‚ÄîHeidelberg section of the Rhine Valley Railway was opened on 15 April 1843 as part of the construction of the Baden Mainline from Mannheim via Heidelberg, Karlsruhe, Baden-Baden and Freiburg to Basel, which was initially built to 1600 mm broad gauge. As a result, Walldorf and Wiesloch gained a connection to the rail network. A few years later the line was duplicated. Since the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway‚Äôs broad gauge was not compatible with the gauge of neighbouring countries, it now feared the loss of lucrative transit traffic. Therefore, in 1854, Baden began to regauge its lines to and this was completed in just four months from Mannheim to Bruchsal. =20th and 21st century= Since the station is located about three kilometres from both Wiesloch and Walldorf, both towns only gained a limited benefit from the line. In 1901, a private branch line, the Wiesloch-Meckesheim/Waldangelloch railway, was opened connecting the centre of Wiesloch with Wiesloch-Walldorf station. This line continued to Meckesheim, providing a connection between the Rhine Valley Railway and the Neckargem√ºnd‚ÄìBad Friedrichshall-Jagstfeld railway. The services of this line operated from a platform in the station forecourt, where there was a connecting track to the state line. Passenger services on this line closed in 1980 and freight traffic was discontinued in 1990. A tramway was built 1902 to connect to the town of Walldorf from the station forecourt, but it was closed in 1954. The station building was demolished sometime before 1990. On Sunday 18 January 1959 a North American F-100 Super Sabre crashed a couple of hundred metres from the station. In 2000, the Zweckverband Bahnhof Wiesloch-Walldorf (Administrative Association of Wiesloch-Walldorf station) was founded to promote the redevelopment of the station and the upgrading of the station's environment. Operations Today, 135 long-distance trains stop at the station each week. It is served by two trains every hour on Intercity line 26 as well as individual services of IC line 30 and an Intercity-Express service. Regional-Express services stop every two hours on the route between Heidelberg and Stuttgart. The station is also integrated in the S-Bahn network of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn and is served by lines S 3 and S 4 at half-hourly intervals towards Heidelberg/Mannheim and Bruchsal/Karlsruhe.

Mooney (September 7, 1924 - December 3, 1994) was a Canadian horse racing executive and breeder who served as president of the Ontario Jockey Club, Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society, Laurel Park Racecourse, and Arlington Park. Early life and career Mooney was born on September 7, 1924, in Toronto, Ontario. Growing up, Mooney traveled with his family. He attended some 36 schools and spent his summers working at racetracks where his father, J. D. Mooney rode. Mooney served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. After the war, he worked full-time in the racing secretary's office at tracks in Ontario and was a patrol judge and minor official at Tropical Park and Oaklawn Park Race Track. He later served as Oaklawn's assistant general manager. Ontario Jockey Club In the early 1950s, Mooney was hired by E. P. Taylor and George C. Hendrie to join the management team of the Ontario Jockey Club while the organization was working to reorganize Ontario racing. This reorganization culminated with the opening of Woodbine Racetrack on June 12, 1956. In 1957 he was named general manager of the Ontario Jockey Club. From 1971 to 1975 he was the OJC's president. During his tenure, the Canadian International Stakes became a race of worldwide importance. Its 1973 running served as the farewell race for Secretariat. In 1962 Mooney was named president of the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society, a Toronto-based organization that assists thoroughbred horse breeders. In 1963 he helped form the National Association of Canadian Race Tracks. In 1972 he succeeded E. P. Taylor as a director of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations. Mooney also raced horses under the stable name O'Maonaigh Abu (Gaelic for \\"Mooney Forever\\"). Later career Mooney left the OJC to develop Nashville Stud, a stud farm he owned near Kleinburg. It was the only farm in Canada to provide both thoroughbred and standardbred stallions. In 1978 he served as director of racing operations at Stampede Park in Calgary. From 1980 to 1981 he was president and general manager of Laurel Park Racecourse. From 1981 to 1983 he was the president of Arlington Park. He later served as director of the United Totalisator Company. In 1989 he was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame as a builder. Personal life Mooney's father J. D. Mooney won the 1924 Kentucky Derby on Black Gold, the 1929 King's Plate on Shorelint, and trained 1962 Canadian Horse of the Year Crafty Lace. His grandfather, John J. Mooney, was a horse breeder and owner. His brother, Paul A. Mooney was the president of the Boston Bruins. Mooney's sons, John Mooney and Mike Mooney, are also involved in thoroughbred racing. Death Mooney died on December 3, 1994, of a heart attack. At the time of his death, he was driving home after attending races at Woodbine.

She was the only female passenger who went down with the sinking of the ship and survived. Early life Abbott was born Rhoda Mary Hunt in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on 14 January 1873, the daughter of Joseph Hunt and his wife Sarah Green Hunt. She grew up in Aylesbury, and spent her early adulthood in St Albans with her family, before moving to the United States in 1894. Upon her arrival in Providence, Rhode Island, she met London- born middleweight champion Stanton Abbott, whom she married soon after in 1895. The couple had two children, Rossmore (born 21 February 1896) and Eugene (born 31 March 1899). She settled as a housewife and mother, and was active at the local Grace Episcopal Church, as well as helping around the house. In 1911, Abbott was divorced from her husband, returned to England with her sons on the RMS Olympic, and started supporting herself and them by working as a sewer, as well as becoming a soldier in The Salvation Army. However, she quickly realized that the boys were not happy living in England and booked a return to America in April 1912. The family boarded the RMS Titanic as third class passengers in Southampton on 10 April. On board, she befriended Amy Stanley, Emily Goldsmith, and May Howard, who had cabins nearby. On 15 April 1912, the family was already asleep when the Titanic hit an iceberg. By 12:15 AM, they were alerted by a steward to put on life jackets and retreat to the ship's deck. After waiting in line to follow other third-class passengers to the deck, Abbott and her sons waited at the second-class saloon area. There, her son Rossmore is said to have knelt in prayer asking that his mother's life be spared even if he and his brother were not saved. Even though only women and children were allowed past the gate, Abbott's sons were able to accompany their mother to the lifeboats. They arrived when one of the final remaining lifeboats, Collapsible C, was already being loaded around 2:00 AM. When it was her turn to enter the lifeboat, she realized that her sons would be denied a spot, and stepping back, refused a place in the lifeboat. When the ship sank, Abbott was swept away from the deck into the water. She tried to clasp her sons, but to no avail. Having given up finding them, and at risk of hypothermia in the freezing water, she was able to reach Collapsible Boat A, which was washed off Titanic at 2:15 AM. Hours went by before Fifth Officer Harold Lowe returned to the site with lifeboat 14 to retrieve survivors in the water. Several occupants of Boat A had either succumbed or slipped back into the icy water; of the people on board, Abbott was one of only 13 who survived. Her two sons were lost at sea, and only Rossmore's body was later identified. According to Stanley, Abbott had no regret about remaining on the Titanic until the very end, because it allowed her to stay with her sons. On board the rescue ship , Abbott received special care in the smoking room. Her legs were badly damaged by the cold water, so that she could not move until arrival in New York. There she was hospitalized for two weeks in Manhattan's St. Vincent's Hospital. She was one of the last survivors to be discharged. Later life As a result of the sinking of the Titanic, Abbott had respiratory problems, including severe bouts of asthma, for the rest of her life. She was not able to comprehend the loss of her sons, and grieved for months. On 16 December 1912, she married longtime friend George Charles Williams, and the couple settled in Jacksonville, Florida. By 1928, they had returned to England to settle Williams' father's estate in London. Abbott took care of her husband until his death in 1938. For the remainder of her life she tried to immigrate back to America, but was always refused. Abbott died in London of heart failure as a result of hypertension on 18 February 1946, at the age of 73. In popular culture Rhoda Abbott makes a possible cameo appearance in James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster Titanic, while Caledon \\"Cal\\" Hockley is attempting to board Collapsible A. He gives the woman a little girl that he used to gain entry into the boat (as the \\"women and children only\\" protocol was still being enforced). She is the only surviving woman in the boat, much like Abbott's actual story of survival. The character later reappears in a deleted scene, having apparently taken in the little girl (who was presumably orphaned).

From a background as a \\"salt and water\\" physician, he made detailed clinical observations and scientifically imaginative connections which were the basis of numerous advances in the molecular biology of the human kidney. Wrong himself contributed to much of the molecular work after his own \\"retirement\\". He dictated amendments to his final paper during his final illness in his own teaching hospital, University College Hospital (UCH), London. Though academic in his leanings, he was a compassionate physician who established a warm rapport with patients, a link he regarded as the keystone of his research. He belonged to a generation of idealistic young doctors responsible for the establishment of the UK's National Health Service in the post-War years. Oliver Wrong on holiday  Background  Wrong was born in Magdalen College, Oxford, and was one of six children of Edward Murray Wrong and Rosalind Smith. Murray Wrong was a history lecturer and later vice-president of Magdalen, and his own father was the historian George MacKinnon Wrong, head of the department of history at University of Toronto. Rosalind, herself a historian, was the daughter of the Master of Balliol, A.L. Smith. Murray died of heart disease at the age of 38 and Oliver wrote an account of his father's illness, including consultations with Sir William Osler, in a vignette \\"Osler and my father\\". His father's early death and the Great Depression led to a split in the upbringing of the six children. Oliver was sent to Toronto with two of his sisters and was raised by his grandfather, George MacKinnon Wrong. Another sister was Rosalind Mitchison.  Education  Oliver Wrong studied Medicine at Magdalen and completed his clinical studies at the Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. His ‚ÄòNational Service‚Äô ‚Äì military conscription - was spent with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Singapore and Malaysia. This was a geographical region to which he would return several times in his research. After internships in Toronto and at Massachusetts General Hospital with Alexander Leaf, he was appointed University Tutor in Medicine at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Leaf was a formative influence and an important paper was jointly produced on the role of Anti-Diuretic Hormone and the kidney.  Research and academic appointments  It was at Manchester with Dr. H.E.F. Davies, in 1959, that Wrong wrote a ground-breaking paper on the mechanisms leading to the excretion of acid in human urine. His clinical analysis of this process and the impact of kidney disease made this paper a ‚ÄòCitation Classic‚Äô. Reviewing his time at Manchester, Wrong noted: ‚ÄòI realise what an excellent education [my years at Manchester] provided by giving me time to tackle my own problems under a benign yet critical supervision. Because of earlier marriage and the rigidity of our postgraduate medical training programme, few of our present graduates feel able to afford such self indulgence‚Äô. After an appointment at UCH, Wrong became senior lecturer in medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital. This was followed by appointment to the Chair of Medicine at Dundee University in 1969 and a return to UCH in 1972 to succeed Professor Charles Dent F.R.S. as a Professor of Medicine. At UCH over the following years, and following retirement in 1990, Wrong developed major insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of the human kidney. Wrong had a parallel interest in the role of the large intestine in salt and water balance and developed much of his own experimental work into a short monograph published in 1981. However, it was his renal work, based initially on the urine acidification test which he developed with Davies, for which Wrong is best known.  Research highlights  The original paper by Wrong and Davies examined the effect of the ‚Äòshort ammonium chloride loading test‚Äô on acid excretion by the kidney. A key insight was that in the group of diseases termed ‚ÄòRenal Tubular Acidosis‚Äô (RTA), urinary excretion of ammonium was relatively well preserved. This was unlike the situation in chronic kidney failure. Furthermore, the paper identified a subset of patients with ‚Äòincomplete‚Äô RTA. In large part due to Wrong's work, it is now recognized that classical ‚Äòdistal‚Äô or ‚ÄòType 1 RTA‚Äô, due to the disease of the distal tubule, is only one form of the disease. ‚ÄòProximal‚Äô or ‚ÄòType 2 RTA‚Äô is another. The identification of several hereditary forms of RTA was developed by Wrong and co-workers and forms the basis of many of the advances of molecular genetics in this area. By rigorous phenotypic classification, Wrong and other workers showed that ‚ÄòType 1 RTA‚Äô could have either dominant (SCL4A1 mutation) or recessive inheritance. It was further shown that there were three forms of recessive RTA distinguished clinically and on the basis of molecular generics divided into disease due to SLC4A1 mutation and either the B1 or a4 subunits of the kidney H+-ATPase due to mutation of the ATP6V1B1 andATP6V0A4 genes respectively. Hereditary ‚ÄòProximal‚Äô or ‚ÄòType 2 RTA‚Äô may be caused by mutation of the SLC4A4 gene and yet a further ‚ÄòType 3 RTA‚Äô with combined features of proximal and distal RTA is due to mutation in the CA2 gene for carbonic anhydrase II. These developments in the molecular biology of the kidney may be traced back in large part, though not exclusively, to Wrong's original 1959 paper. Nephrocalcinosis was a subject on which Wrong was an international expert and he wrote the relevant chapter on this subject for one of the standard nephrology textbooks. It is a summary of his experience of this finding based on almost his entire professional life. Wrong was unusual in the breadth of his medical interests. His 1981 reference book, The Large Intestine: Its role in Mammalian Nutrition and Homeostasis, summarised research into a part of the human anatomy he felt was neglected due to unprofessional squeamishness on the part of the scientific establishment. \\"There is a curious reluctance in the medical profession to handle faeces,\\" he said. He began a 1965 paper on the electrolyte content of human waste with the characteristically playful: \\"Stool is the Cinderella of electrolyte studies.\\" A great believer in self-experimentation, Wrong invented the \\"Wrong bags\\", which allow precious \\"in vivo\\" insights into the colon‚Äôs hidden workings. These were rolled-up ribbons of semi-permeable tubing which could be eaten at breakfast and examined on retrieval distended with faecal fluid allowing comparison of gastrointestinal solute transport in normal subjects and those with kidney failure. Wrong manufactured 5,000 of these \\"bags\\" in his laboratory, and while colleagues and family members were recruited as experimental subjects, he swallowed most of them himself. Stool Dialysis In a major medical insight, Wrong realised that a number of the patients he was seeing in one of his clinics at UCH had an apparently hereditary clinical syndrome very similar to that reported some 20 years earlier by Dent (his predecessor as Professor of Medicine at UCH) and Friedman in 1964. Dent and Friedman originally reported two unrelated patients with the condition they termed ‚ÄòHypercalcuric Rickets‚Äô without identifying any hereditary component. Wrong, based on his own additional clinical work, discovered that this was a new hereditary disease and with his co-workers Norden and Feest reported it as a form of the renal ‚ÄòFanconi Syndrome‚Äô. A very similar hereditary clinical syndrome was reported by Scheinman and colleagues. This clinical work was put on a very firm basis by Thakker, Scheinman and Wrong and colleagues who determined that mutation of the chloride channel gene CLCN5 was the cause of many, though not all, of these disorders including one of the two original patients described by Dent and Friedman. Wrong had already been ‚Äòretired‚Äô for 6 years when this was published. It became clear that several similar clinical conditions were, on the basis of genetic analysis, the same as that which Wrong had originally termed ‚ÄòDent‚Äôs Disease‚Äô in honour of his late mentor. This disease is variously termed Dent's disease or Dent disease. Wrong's insights, which made this previously relatively neglected disease well-known, have prompted the suggestion that the disease should more properly be termed ‚ÄòDent-Wrong‚Äô disease. Wrong's identification of Dent and Friedman's second patient as having ‚Äòclinical‚Äô Dent Disease was expanded when, in 2005, Scheinman's group identified this patient and his family as having mutations not in CLCN5, the gene mutated in most of the families with Dent disease originally identified, but in a quite different gene OCRL1. This gene had been identified earlier as mutated in patients with ‚ÄòLowe Syndrome‚Äô. Wrong's discoveries had led to the identification of two new ‚Äònew‚Äô hereditary diseases, each based on one of Dent and Friedman's original patients, and one ‚ÄòDent Disease Type 1‚Äô due to CLCN5 mutation and the other, ‚ÄòDent Disease Type 2‚Äô due to OCRL1 mutation. Wrong, who had been diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis seven years earlier, was working on his final paper when admitted to Intensive Care Unit at UCH, the hospital at which he had spent most of his professional life. The paper, published posthumously, describes a variant of autosomal dominant distal RTA, due to SLC4A1 mutations, originally found in SE Asia. In that final paper, Wrong presented a novel hypothesis to explain the frequency of the mutations in the tropics despite their adverse clinical effects. He suggested that changes in red cell metabolism might protect against malaria, a major killer in the region. Professor Wrong's papers are stored at the Wellcome Trust Library, 183 Euston Road, London.  Family  Oliver Wrong married Marilda Musacchio, a primary school teacher from the Val d'Aosta, Italy, in 1956\\\\. They had three daughters, one of whom is the author and journalist Michela Wrong.

The 2012 event was sponsored by Coca-Cola and Samsung. 2012 Information on this festival was first revealed in February 2012 by Coca-Cola. Big Bang and Tata Young were the first international artists to be included in the line-up besides the local bands and singers after Samsung sponsored with Coca-Cola. Later, it was revealed that Big Bang was paid US$250,000 for 30 minutes at the event. On March 29, Taio Cruz and Kimberly Caldwell were added to the list to increase some more fans to make the event extremely successful, and Audi later joined as the official sponsor for the event. The event was held at Phu Tho Racing Field in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and the official organizer for this event was Saigon Sound System (after their first and successful Bob Dylan concert held on April 10, 2011 at RMIT). According to the hosts, there were 40,000 people attending SoundFest; however, Caldwell posted on her Facebook that there were 51,000 attenders. Despite there were some small controversies due to the fact several Big Bang fans jostled and fainted before and during the Big Bang performance at 8pm, including the exhaustion from waiting such under the hot weather for almost 4 hours (1pm-5pm), Soundfest received extremely positive reviews from several audiences, the critics, and the social media, and was an overwhelming success in terms of the first-ever large scale concert in Vietnam after CAMA and Loreto Fest (also Saigon Sound System) The song 'Wavin' Flag' was performed by Ph∆∞∆°ng Vy as part of the interest ahead of the Barclays Premier League finals, UEFA Euro 2012, and the forthcoming London Olympics 2012. =Artists= (In performing order) *Unlimited *Ti·∫øn ƒê·∫°t *B·ª©c T∆∞·ªùng *Microwave *Th·∫£o Trang *H√† Okio Ha Okio Info \\"Ha Okio's facebook page\\" #S√†i G√≤n Cafe S·ªØa ƒê√° Saigon Cafe Sua Da (Saigon Milk Coffee With Ice) \\"Ha Okio live at Soundfest\\" #Turn Your Lights Down Low Turn Your Lights Down Low \\"Ha Okio live at Soundfest\\" 2012 #I'm Yours/ Where Is The Love #N∆°i ·∫§yNoi Ay (The Place) \\"Ha Okio live at Soundfest\\" #Nh∆∞ L√† M∆° (with N.P.

Pushing and jostling was another problem, especially when Big Bang began their performance. Several fans fainted while many fans standing in the front row were pushed to the barriers, some were injured.. The organizer eventually had to pause the band's performance to warn the audience to stop pushing, or else the show would be cancelled. After Big Bang's performance, many of the audience left despite the fact that there were still other acts to come. =Reviews= Soundfest is the financial and critical success, calling the festival 'the new generation of music in 2012!' Future It is unknown whether the 2013 event will be held. However, during the 2012 event, the hosts stated that if there were no serious accidents in SoundFest 2012, there might be SoundFest 2013. Kimberly Caldwell, DJ Ajam also expressed the anticipation for next year's SoundFest.

James Duffus (half pay Naval Officer), whose brother-in-law was Sir Samuel Cunard founder of the Cunard Line of steamships, founded his home on what is now Kidston Island. Duffus operated a mercantile business on the island, serving people from River Baddeck and Grand Narrows; customers were ferried to the island by canoe. Duffus died in 1833, and his former assistants operated the business for a little over two years. In 1836 the executors of his estate in Halifax sent William Kidston to wind up his business. Kidston met and ended up marrying Margaret Ann Duffus, widow of James Duffus, in 1836 and taking over the business. The Kidston business was moved to the mainland in 1840.

Bollito and its many regional variations is eaten throughout northern Italy, and is particularly popular in Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Lombardy. The meat is sliced thinly and served with coarse sea salt, mostarda, salsa verde, horseradish, or chutney. The resulting broth is skimmed, strained, and used as a base for soups and risottos.  History  In Italian cuisine, bollito was prominent throughout the second millennium. In the 1800s, crown prince and from 1849 king Vittorio Emanuele II would often sneak off to the small town of Moncalvo to hunt wild game, cavort with his favorite mistress, and enjoy a convivial meal of bollito with friends. Bollito features prominently in various gastronomic texts: Antonio Latini has 38 cooking suggestions for bollito in his cookbook, Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward) (1694); and Maestro Martino has several recipes in his book Libro de Arte Coquinaria (The Art of Cooking), which is considered a landmark of Italian gastronomic literature.

Location  The Monmouth War Memorial is located in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales. It is positioned in the centre of St. James' Square, within the roundabout of Whitecross Street, Old Dixton Road, and St. James' Street. The Catalpa tree behind the cenotaph was imported from North America and planted about 1900. At the time of the unveiling of the monument in 1921, the Catalpa was already a mature tree. There are formal plantings on three sides of the memorial. The monument, plantings, and adjacent lawn are surrounded by railings. The Indian Bean Tree, however, was condemned by the Monmouthshire City Council. Opponents of the decision to fell the tree hired a professional arboriculturalist who concluded that the tree could be treated to extend its life.  Description  The Monmouth War Memorial was created by sculptor W. Clarke of Llandaff. The war monument is composed of a three-step base and column, upon which there is the figure of a soldier. The column has multiple metal plaques, including two on the front. The upper, smaller plaque indicates that the monument commemorates the residents of Monmouth who died in both World War I and World War II. It reads: \\"To the memory of the Monmouth men who fell in the wars 1914‚Äì1918 1939‚Äì1945.\\" The lower, larger plaque on the front of the monument lists the deceased Monmouth soldiers of the Second World War, 1939 to 1945.

The Institute was founded in 1960, in New York City, by Nathan Ackerman, who became its first president and from whom the Institute derives its name. It is located at 936 Broadway, New York City. Ackerman Institute's function is to provide: * Couple and family therapy services through its on- site Clinic (licensed by the State of New York Office of Mental Health).New York State Office of Mental Health. http://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/licensing/ * Training programs for mental health and other professionals on-site, in community settings and internationally. * Research initiatives that focus on the development of new treatment models and training techniques. History Dr. Nathan W. Ackerman founded the Ackerman Institute for the Family in 1960. Although trained as a classical analyst, Dr. Ackerman broke with this approach after World War II when he began to experiment with seeing patients and their families in a group.Hoffman, Lynn. Foundations of Family Therapy: A Conceptual Framework for Systems Change. New York: Basic Books Inc., 1981. . He published, taught and showed movies demonstrating this new method, pioneering not only a new type of therapy, but also the tradition of the audiovisual documentation of clinical work that became one of the cornerstones of family therapy training. In 1960, a group of families treated by Dr. Ackerman established a non-profit institute to allow him to expand his training activities.Ackerman, Nathan. The Strength of Family Therapy: Selected Papers of Nathan W. Ackerman. Edited by Donald Bloch. New York: Brunner-Routledge, 1982. . In 1967, Donald Bloch became the Ackerman Institute's second director. Under his leadership, the Institute inaugurated an expanded clinical training program, developed a large family therapy clinic housed at the Institute and initiated a series of projects aimed at creating new approaches to particularly difficult clinical problems.McDaniel, Susan H., and Campbell, Thomas L. ‚ÄúA Tribute to Donald A. Bloch, MD.‚Äù Families, Systems, & Health v20 (2002): 331-332. In 1970, Kitty LaPerriere became the Institute‚Äôs first Director of Training.

Drug‚Äìimpaired driving, in the context of its legal definition, is the act of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of an impairing substance. DUID, or Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, is prohibited in many countries. Several American states and European countries now have \\"per se\\" DUID laws that presume a driver is impaired if they are found to have any detectable quantity of controlled substances in their body while operating an automobile and that the driver has no doctor's prescription for the substance. This is similar to the \\"per se\\" DUI/DWI laws that presume a driver is impaired when their blood alcohol content is above a certain level (currently 0.08% in the United States). There is some controversy with \\"per se\\" DUID laws in that a driver with any detectable quantity of controlled substances may not in fact be impaired and the detectable quantity in blood or sweat may be only the remnants of drug use in days or weeks past. It is against Road traffic safety. United States According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Drug Evaluation and Classification program (DEC), a drug is ‚Äúany substance that, when taken into the human body, can impair the ability of the person to operate a vehicle safely.\\" Under this definition, alcohol would be classified as a drug. For the purposes of this article, drug impaired driving is the use of drugs other than alcohol and the effect on driving. =Detection= Testing for alcohol concentration is performed using three methods ‚Äì blood, breath, or urine. For law enforcement purposes, breath is the preferred method, since results are available almost instantaneously. Drug testing screens are typically performed in scientific laboratories so that the results will be admissible in evidence at trial. Due to the overwhelming number of impairing substances that are not alcohol, drugs are classified into different categories for detection purposes. Drug impaired drivers still show impairment during the battery of standardized field sobriety tests, but there are additional tests to help detect drug impaired driving. The Drug Evaluation and Classification program is designed to detect a drug impaired driver and classify the categories of drugs present in their system. The DEC program breaks down detection into a 12-step process that a government-certified Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) can use to determine the category or categories of drugs that a suspect is impaired by. The 12 steps are #Breath Alcohol Test #Interview with Arresting Officer #Preliminary Evaluation #Evaluation of the Eyes #Psychomotor Tests #Vital Signs #Dark Room Examinations #Muscle Tone #Injection Sites #Interrogation of Suspect #Opinion of the Evaluator #Toxicological Examination DREs are qualified to offer expert testimony in court that pertains to impaired driving on drugs. The use of the 12-step process is scientifically validated by numerous field studies. =Drug categories= The DEC program recognizes seven separate categories of impairing drugs: *CNS depressants ‚Äì Drugs such as alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines fit in this category *CNS stimulants ‚Äì Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines fit in this category *Hallucinogens ‚Äì Drugs such as LSD, peyote, and MDMA fit in this category *Dissociative anesthetics ‚Äì drugs such as PCP and Ketamine fit in this category *Narcotic analgesics‚Äì synthetic and derivative opiates fit in this category *Inhalants ‚Äì volatile solvents, anesthetic gases and aerosol sprays fit in this category *cannabis ‚Äì marijuana fits in this category =Laws= In The United States, 19 states have laws in effect that punish drug impaired driving. All states but West Virginia have a Drug Recognition Expert program. The following states have drug statutes enacted Alaska ‚Äì Statute 28.35.030 ‚Äì ‚Äú (a) A person commits the crime of driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or controlled substance if the person operates or drives a motor vehicle or operates an aircraft or a watercraft while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, intoxicating liquor, inhalant, or any controlled substance, singly or in combination\\" Arizona ‚ÄúA. It is unlawful for a person to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle in this state under any of the following circumstances: 1\\\\. While under the influence of intoxicating liquor, any drug, a vapor releasing substance containing a toxic substance or any combination of liquor, drugs or vapor releasing substances if the person is impaired to the slightest degree. \\" Colorado ‚Äì Statute 42-4-1301 ‚Äì Colorado law prohibits a person from driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or while the person's ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs. Section IV states \\"If at such time the driver's blood contained five nanograms or more of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter in whole blood, as shown by analysis of the defendant's blood, such fact gives rise to a permissible inference that the defendant was under the influence of one or more drugs.\\" DUI-D cases often involve these two police tools: (1) a voluntary Drug Recognition Evaluation (DRE) which is similar to a field sobriety test and allows police officers to draw conclusions about a drivers impairment, and (2) a blood test to screen and confirm traces of drug use in a defendant's system.

This is the same offence as driving while impaired by alcohol and carries the same penalties as alcohol-impaired driving. A charge of impaired driving can be tried either summarily or by indictment. The Crown prosecutor can elect which method to proceed under, based on the seriousness of the offence, but if harm has occurred to another person, the charge must proceed by indictment. =Range of Penalties= Summary Proceedings If a charge is tried summarily, the accused faces the following sentences if convicted:Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255(1). * for a first offence, a minimum fine of $1,000, with the possibility of a term of imprisonment up to a maximum of 18 months; * for a second offence, a fine of up to $5,000, and a minimum term of imprisonment of 30 days, up to a maximum of 18 months; * for a third offence, a fine of up to $5,000 and a minimum term of imprisonment of 120 days, up to a maximum of 18 months. Indictable Proceedings If a charge is tried by indictment, the penalties upon conviction are more severe: * if no harm has occurred to another person, potential imprisonment up to a maximum of 5 years; * if bodily harm to another person has been caused the impaired driving, potential imprisonment up to a maximum of 10 years;Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255(2). * if a death has been caused by the impaired driving, potential life imprisonment,Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255(3). with the possibility of parole after 7 years.Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992 c. 20, s 120(2). =Samples of bodily fluids= If the police have reasonable grounds to believe that a motorist's ability to drive is impaired by a drug, they can make a demand for samples of oral fluids, urine or blood for analysis.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254(3.4). If the motorist refuses to provide the sample, it is an offence,Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254(5). and carries exactly the same potential penalties as the offence of impaired driving.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255(1),(2.2),(3.2). =Driving prohibitions and licence suspensions= Upon a conviction for drug- impaired driving, there is in all cases a mandatory driving prohibition as part of the sentence under the Criminal Code:Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 259(1). * for a first offence, a minimum prohibition of 1 year, up to a maximum of 3 years; * for a second offence, a minimum prohibition of 2 years, up to a maximum of 5 years; * for a subsequent offence, a minimum prohibition of at least 3 years. In all cases, these periods of prohibition are in addition to the time for which the accused is sentenced to imprisonment. In addition to the driving prohibitions as part of the sentence for the criminal offence, the provinces can impose licence suspensions under provincial law.Ontario: Driver's Handbook - Other Ways to Lose Your Licence European Laws Drug impaired driving is today suspected by the European Road Safety Observatory of being the reason that drink driving crash rates no longer reduce in direct proportion to reducing or plateaued numbers of drunk drivers found on roads. It is believed that the remaining ones are carrying more risk than their blood alcohol levels should strictly impart - due to the frequent addition of other drugs. If the historic assumptions about formulae to setting alcohol limits at particular levels to reduce harm (by anticipated degrees) in the target demographic are defunct, the implications for impaired driving reduction policy are major. =Ireland= In Ireland, it is illegal to drive a motor vehicle if one's ability to drive is impaired by a drug. This is the same offence as driving while impaired by alcohol and carries less penalties than alcohol-impaired driving despite being just as dangerous. As of 2014, the Road Safety Authority conducts roadside impairment testing of those who are believed to be under the influence of drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and many others. United Kingdom Recent UK legislation effective 2 March 2015 has introduced a series of new offences into the realm of road traffic law. The government has sought to tackle the belated increased number of drivers operating vehicles with a high measure of proscribed and prescribed drugs in their system. The new offences detail at least 8 illegal drugs and 8 legally prescribed drugs, which have been given set levels to be tested. Illegal drugs will have a 'trace' level set that would constitute a criminal offence. Drivers who are taking legally prescribed medication will be required to closely follow their doctor's and drug manufacturer's guidance when taking the medication. If the driver is found to be carrying more than the set levels in their system, outside of the set guidelines, they will be guilty of an offence under the new rules.  Hong Kong  Deterring drug-driving is one of the work priorities of the Police.https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/01_about_us/cop2018.html The Court may disqualify the driver for life.https://www.police.gov.hk/info/doc/rs_pm/driver/d08.pdf Driving under the influence of drugs ‚Äúto an extent as to be incapable of having proper control‚Äù is illegal.https://www.police.gov.hk/info/doc/rs_pm/driver/d01.pdf The Police may require suspects to undergo an objective (at the police station) Impairment Test.https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/05_traffic_matters/dd.html Suspects who fail the test shall surrender their driving licence for 24 hours. Regarding common drugs, the Road Safety Council reminds drivers to check the side effects before driving.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpA9s-zDgQE The law prohibits driving with any concentration of illicit drugs: heroin, cocaine, ketamine, methamphetamine, cannabis and MDMA.https://www.police.gov.hk/info/doc/rs_pm/driver/d09.pdf New Zealand New Zealand in 2009 passed unique legislation, which created a zero tolerance law for driving under the influence of class A drugs (methamphetamine) to discourage their use, and a requirement for impairment testing if other drugs are suspected. New Zealand's main issue in traffic is Class C drugs, so this law could appear oriented to support the \\"war on (hard) drugs\\". Road Safety advocates however supported the provision for intolerance of methamphetamine, introduced by Opposition MP Trevor Mallard. As intoxicated users can pass traditional impairment tests despite being unfit to drive (mood and judgment), and the time that drivers may be most at risk is when in the come down and levels are low, making any cut off level in future self-defeating. Controversy This controversy is reduced by reducing the potential for wrongful convictions in 2 ways; firstly if blood tests are used to obtain convictions most legal frameworks outside the United States require corroborating evidence of impairment to support that the blood test result represents impairment. This ranges from suspects being required to undertake physical co-ordination tests, to computerised pupil reaction tests, to use of witness accounts of general behaviour and erratic driving, and may include expert testimony as to expected impacts on performance. Secondly, when saliva tests are used (Australia), a cut off threshold is calibrated in fitting with U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration standards, at such a level that countries other than the United States have erroneously assumed that the average person would be impaired by the drug detected to a degree that crash risk is significantly raised. The original levels stated by SAMHSA were determined and established simply to detect any drug use; these data were promulgated for testing for individuals in sensitive employment positions regarding public safety and/or national security (7 Nev. L.J. 570 (2006-2007) DWI and Drugs: A Look at Per Se Laws for Marijuana). Studies have shown that this use can be as long as weeks in the past (id.). In Germany where more economical sweat tests are used, it is not possible to calibrate detection to a level linked to impairment, and all users may be identified. So unless there has been injury caused there is no criminal charge, but only an administrative one of driving with drugs present, which does not infer impairment or lack of it. This is similar to a speeding ticket as a disincentive for potentially risky behaviour. However if injury was caused, a process of further evidence gathering of driver impairment may be triggered, which can lead to a criminal violation. Systems where there is a penalty after detection of target drugs are sometimes misnamed zero tolerance for the foregoing reasons. Genuine zero tolerance jurisdictions (ones not applying rational cut offs) are generally failing to substantially reducing drugged driving, where it has been a problem originally. However, in Australia where the use of calibrated devices create de facto limits for common impairing illicit substances, roadside detections and self reporting of drug driving in National telephone surveys have reduced by 25% over the last 3‚Äì4 years. Enforcement Varying DUID laws have been passed over the last 15 years in response to both increasing roles of drug driving in road tolls, and the fact prosecutors have found it difficult to prove that a driver was impaired from using a controlled substance. Practical difficulties included the transient effects of some drugs wearing off before either police or doctors had a chance to assess many suspects for impairment, and also the expense of having to call expert forensic witnesses before courts to interpret results on a case by case basis. These laws can make their cases much easier to win if they only have to prove the presence of a controlled substance in the blood or urine, without a prescription. The logic in zero tolerance jurisdictions is that the trade off of more efficient prosecutions of potentially impaired individuals is well worth the possible erroneous convictions of a lesser number of drivers who may not in fact be impaired, because the driver was already violating the law by using a controlled substance without a prescription. There is a tension with such an approach and enhanced road safety. Promoting zero drug use, as with alcohol prohibition, is not a realistic goal and Policing and Court resources are clearly best targeted at hazardous use. The most successful laws for reducing drink driving have sought to modify cultural norms and the target group's behaviour, separating impairment and driving. An approach that appears to be working most successfully to reduce drug driving, based on the Australian experience of matching public health guidelines, such as no driving for approximately 3 hours after cannabis use, with targeted legal intervention (the saliva test drug detection threshold).

Kharazmi University is considered as the oldest institution of higher education in Iran. It was established in 1919 as the Central Teachers' Institute and gained university status as Tarbiat Moallem University of Tehran in 1974. It changed its name to Kharazmi University on January 31, 2012. In 2015, the University of Economic Science was merged into Kharazmi University as its faculty of management, faculty of financial sciences and faculty of economics. The university has two main campuses, the main campus including administration offices located in Tehran, another is in the Hesarak district of Karaj. Times ranking Kharazmi University School of Engineering won international rankings of 601-800th in 2019,2020 and ranked 6th and 10th in order to industrial incomes among Iranian universities in 2020 ranking in Civil Engineering and another branches Education  History  The first teacher training institution for primary schools in Iran was established as Darol-Mo'allemin Markazi (Central college of Teachers) in the building of the Culture Ministry in Takht-e-Zomorod area of Tehran in 1919. With the increase in the number of schools in Iran and the increasing need for trained teachers, Darol-Mo'allemin Markazi was developed into Darol-Mo'allemin Aali (Higher college of Teachers) at the Higher Council for Sciences in October 1926. In December 1927, the Iranian Parliament passed a law to modify the statute of the latter institution to support it further and help employ its graduates nationwide. From then on, Darol-Mo'allemin Aali was divided into the two major ‚Äòsciences' and ‚Äòliterary' departments. In 1932 and with expansion of the courses offered, Darol-Mo'allemin Aali moved to Negarestan building, which had, as part of the Negarestan Garden, started its history as the summer residence of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, the second king of the Qajar dynasty in 1808. Darol-Mo'allemin Aali changed its name to Daneshsaraye Aali (Higher Training College) in 1933. In 1963, the board of ministers supplanted the Danesh-saraye-ali with the organization for Teacher Education and Educational Research. The organization was rebadged again as Danesh-saraye-ali, however, and came to be sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education after the latter was founded in the country in 1967. In 1974, with the approval of the Council for the Expansion of Higher Education at the Ministry of Higher Education, Danesh-saraye-ali turned into Teacher Training University with its own dedicated board of trustees. The university was subsequently assigned with the task of developing teacher education programmes across the country and Danesh-saraye-alis or Higher Training Colleges were duly established in Zahedan, Sanandaj and Yazd and the Science Schools in Arak and Kashan were affiliated with Teacher Training University. The two final branches of the university were finally established in Sabzevar and Tabriz in 1987 and 1989 respectively. Old building of Kharazmi University, formerly known as Central college of Teachers In 1990, all the higher education institutions affiliated with or established by Teacher Training University were separated from and granted independence by the Council for the Expansion of Higher Education at the Ministry of Higher Education. The university changed its name to Kharazmi University January, 2012 to further expand and strengthen the educational and research activities at the university, the University of Economic Sciences was incorporated into Kharazmi University according to the decision made on 15.03.2015 at the Council for the Expansion of Higher Education at the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.  Campuses  = Tehran Campus = The Tehran Campus has as one of its attractions national the heritage building designed by the Russian-Iranian architect Nikolai Markov in the late 1920s‚Äîis located in an area of 2 square kilometers on Mofatteh Ave. This place is located in central Tehran. = Karaj Campus = With the increase in the courses offered and the activities at the university generally the construction of a second campus started in 1977 in the city of Karaj, west of the province of Tehran. The Karaj Campus covers almost 200 hectares of land and it includes, in addition to a central administrative building, the buildings of the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Psychology and Education, Faculty of Education and Literature and Faculty of Humanities as well as student dormitories, staff houses, recreational facilities and other installations.

All these duchies were situated in Silesia, then part of the Crown of Bohemia.  Life  His parents were John \\"the Iron\\" and Helena of Lithuania (niece of King Wladyslaw II Jagiello of Poland). Although Nicholas and his younger brother Wenceslaus II were probably adults when their father died in 1424, their mother, Helena of Lithuania nevertheless acted as regent until 1428. Until 1449, she styled herself as Lady of Pless, suggesting that she had received Pless as her jointure. Nicholas V and Wenceslaus II ruled their duchy jointly until 1437, at which time they divided their inheritance. Nicholas V received Krnov, Brunt√°l, Rybnik, Pless, and Babor√≥w, while Wenceslaus II received Racib√≥rz. In 1433, a Hussite army passing through the V√°h valley devastated Racib√≥rz and prepared to hand it to Duke Bolko V of Opole, who supported the Hussites. However, Nicholas V reconquered Racib√≥rz. In 1436, Nicholas V also conquered the Duchy of G≈Çubczyce, which was owned by Duke Wenceslaus II of Opava, who retaliated by conquering ≈ªory. In 1437, Nicholas V and Wenceslaus II of Opava reached a compromise. In 1443, Nicholas allied himself with Dukes William of Opava, Przemyslaus II of Cieszyn, and Henry IX of ≈ªaga≈Ñ-G≈Çog√≥w against the robber barons who infested Silesia. Nicholas V died in 1452.

Homeland hypotheses = Europe versus Siberia = It has been suggested that the Proto-Uralic homeland was located near the Ural Mountains, either on the European or the Siberian side. The main reason to suppose that there was a Siberian homeland has been the traditional taxonomic model that sees the Samoyedic branch as splitting off first. Because the present border between the Samoyedic and the Ugric branch is in Western Siberia, the original split was seen to have occurred there too. However, because the Ugric languages are known to have been spoken earlier on the European side of the Urals, a European homeland would be equally possible. In recent years, it has also been argued on the basis of phonology that the oldest split was not between the Samoyedic and the Finno-Ugric but between the Finno-Permic and the Ugro-Samoyedic language groups.H√§kkinen, Jaakko 2007: Kantauralin murteutuminen vokaalivastaavuuksien valossak. The lexical level is argued to be less reliable, and lexical innovativeness (a small number of shared cognates) can be confused because of the great age of the division. For a long time, no new arguments for a Siberian homeland have been presented. Both European and Siberian homeland proposals have been supported by palaeolinguistic evidence, but only those cases in which the semantic reconstructions are certain are valid. A Siberian homeland has been claimed on the basis of two coniferous tree names in Proto-Uralic, but the trees (Abies sibirica and Pinus cembra) have for a long time been present also in the far east of Europe. A European homeland is supported by words for 'bee', 'honey', 'elm' etc.Sebesty√©n-N√©meth, Irene 1951‚Äì1952: Zur Frage des alten Wohngebietes der uralischen V√∂lker.

Patton, The Indo-Aryan Controversy: Evidence and Inference in Indian History, Routledge 2005, p. 127 Some scholars believe that the culture of Lyalovo was in fact the Proto-Uralic urheimat and that its inhabitants spread Uralic languages to north-eastern Europe.Parpola, Asko & Carpelan, Christian: The Cultural Counterparts to Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Uralic and Proto-Aryan - Matching the dispersal and contact patterns in the linguistic and archaeological record, pp. 107‚Äì141, 2005 The Volosovo culture has been named the Bronze Age Successor Culture, a textile-ceramic culture that developed in the region between Upper Volga and lakes Ladoga and Onega. It was distinguished from other groups based on the traces of textile used for the production of ceramics, and spread southeast all the way to central Volga, south to the entire river valley of the Oka, southwest to the northern shore of the Daugava, and northwest of Fennoscandia to Karelia, Finland and northern Sweden and Norway.Koshmenko, MG: The Culture of Bronze Age Net Ware in Karelia.

Known as the Seima- Turbino phenomenon, it was a culturally unified, extensive network of trade in copper and bronze.

However, Jaakko H√§kkinen argues that the language of the Volosovo culture was not itself Uralic, but a Paleo-European substratum to Uralic, especially its westernmost branches, and identifies Proto-Uralic with the Garino-Bor culture instead. The Volosovo region was invaded by the Abashevo cultural groups at about 2300 BC. The latter buried their deceased in kurgans, and they are thought to have spoken a form of Indo-European ancestral to the Indo-Iranian languages and to have influenced the Volosovian vocabulary by introducing Aryan (Indo-Iranian) loan words. The Abashevo contributed to the fact that livestock farming and small-scale farming began to be practiced in the southern parts of the forest zone of Taiga.Parpola, Asko: \\"The Face Urns of Gandhra and the N√¢satya Cult\\", Migrations, trade and peoples, Part 3, pp.149-162Antony, David W.: The Horse, The Wheel, and Language: The Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World.

However, Aikio (2014) puts the date of borrowing much later, arguing that the loanwords he accepts as valid were borrowed from an early stage of Samoyedic (preceding Proto-Samoyedic; thus roughly in the 1st millennium BC) into Yukaghir, in the same general region between the Yenisei River and Lake Baikal.

Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen. 2014 (62): 7‚Äì76. =Continuity theories= Archaeological continuity has long been used as the basis of an argument for linguistic continuity. The argument was advanced by Estonians Paul Ariste and Harri Moora in 1956.Moora, Harri (editor) 1956: Eesti rahva etnilisest ajaloost. Tallinn. Just as long, this kind of argumentation has also been heavily criticised. The oldest version of the continuity theory can be called the moderate or shallow continuity theory. It claims that linguistic continuity in Estonia and Finland can be traced back to the arrival of Typical Combed Ware, about 6,000 years ago. This view became mainstream in the multidisciplinary Tv√§rminne symposium in 1980.Gall√©n, Jarl (editor) 1984: Suomen v√§est√∂n esihistorialliset juuret. Tv√§rminnen symposiumi 17.‚Äì19.1.1980. Bidrag till k√§nnedom av Finlands natur och folk, 131. Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica. At the time, there seemed to be no serious linguistic results to contradict this archaeological view. The continuity argumentation in the Uralic studies gained greater visibility in the 1990s, when the next step of the continuity theory was popularised (even though this line of reasoning had occasionally received airing). In the radical or deep continuity theory, it is claimed that the linguistic continuity in Finland could be traced back to the Mesolithic initial colonization, beyond 10,000 years.Nu√±ez, Milton G. 1987: A Model for the Early Settlement of Finland. ‚Äì Fennoscandia Archaeologica 4.Wiik, Kalevi 2002: Eurooppalaisten juuret. Jyv√§skyl√§: Atena. However, in Indo-European studies, J. P. Mallory had already thoroughly scrutinized the methodological weaknesses of the continuity argumentation in 1989.Mallory, J. P. 1989: In Search of the Indo-Europeans. Language, Archaeology and Myth. London: Thames and Hudson. In Uralic studies, it was also soon noted that the same argument (archaeological continuity) was used to support contradicting views, which revealed the method's unreliability.Mallory, J.

Nowadays linguists rarely believe in the continuity theories because of their shown methodological flaws and their incompatibility with the new linguistic results, but some archaeologists and laymen may still advance such arguments.Janhunen, Juha (Helsinki 2009): \\"Proto-Uralic ‚Äî What, where, and when?\\" In: The Quasquicentennial of the Finno-Ugrian Society 2009 Modern view Recent linguistic arguments have placed the Proto-Uralic homeland possibly around the Kama River or, more generally, close to the Great Volga Bend and the Ural Mountains, although Petri Kallio, while agreeing with the placement of the homeland in Central Russia, prefers the Volga-Oka region further to the west. The expansion of Proto-Uralic has been dated to about 2000 BC (4000 years ago), and its earlier stages go back at least one or two millennia earlier. Either way, this is considerably later than the earlier views of the continuity theories, which would place Proto-Uralic deep into Europe. Juha Janhunen, and others, suggest a homeland in South-Central Siberia, near Lake Baikal and the Sayan Mountains in the Russian-Mongolian border region, around 3000 BC. Similarly, Ante Aikio concludes that the time- depth of Uralic is roughly comparable to that of Indo-European, and based on areal typology, as well as lexicon, an origin in the vicinity of the Altaic (Turkic‚ÄìMongolic‚ÄìTungusic) Sprachbund appears more plausible than one in Europe, in the vicinity of Indo-European.

In addition, haplogroup Z (mtDNA), found with low frequency in Saami, Finns, and Siberians, is related to the migration of Uralic peoples. In recent genetic analysis of ancient human bones excavated from the remains of Liao civilization, haplogroup N1 (Y-DNA) is found with a high frequency, of 60-100%. Therefore, a new possibility arises that the origin of Uralic languages (and perhaps also of the Yukaghir languages) may be Liao River region. The oldest Pit‚ÄìComb Ceramic, related to Finno-Ugric peoples, is also found in the Liao civilization. That is also corroborated by the works of Vladimir Napolskikh, who studied the origins of the \\"earth-diver\\" creation myths and concluded that a certain variety of those myths, which is found in the folklore of Uralic peoples and other N1(Y-DNA) populations, originated in Northern Asia, possibly in the northeastern regions of today's China.Napolskikh V.

The episode is written by Vanessa Taylor and directed by David Petrarca. It premiered on April 22, 2012. The episode's title comes from a phrase used by Ser Jorah Mormont to describe the desert surrounding the city of Qarth to Daenerys. Plot =At Oxcross= Robb defeats Lannister reinforcements in a night-time attack on the town of Oxcross in the Westerlands. His bannerman Lord Roose Bolton suggests flaying and interrogating the prisoners, but Robb insists on fair treatment. Robb encounters field nurse Talisa, and is impressed by her. =In King's Landing= After hearing of Robb's victory, Joffrey orders Sansa be publicly beaten, but Tyrion and Bronn defuse the situation. At Bronn's suggestion, Tyrion sends prostitutes Ros and Daisy to Joffrey, who forces Ros to beat Daisy as a message to Tyrion. Lancel informs Tyrion that Cersei has ordered Pycelle's release. Tyrion tells Lancel that he is aware of his affair with Cersei, but will keep the truth from Joffrey in exchange for Lancel spying on Cersei. =At Harrenhal= Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie are brought to the ruined castle Harrenhal, where the Lannister garrison, commanded by Gregor \\"The Mountain\\" Clegane, tortures and kills prisoners for information concerning \\"the Brotherhood\\". Tywin arrives, ending the brutality and ordering the prisoners be put to work. Polliver threatens Arya but she is spared by Tywin, who recognizes she is a girl and makes her his cupbearer. =Outside Qarth= Daenerys receives word from Kovarro that the nearby city of Qarth welcomes the \\"Mother of Dragons\\". Ser Jorah cautions that Qarth is located in the brutal desert of the \\"Garden of Bones\\". Daenerys and her khalasar meet with Qarth's rulers, the Thirteen, outside the city. The Thirteen ask to see Daenerys's dragons in exchange for shelter. She asks that her people are attended to first, and the Thirteen abandon them to the desert. Daenerys swears vengeance should they not grant them shelter, and one of the Thirteen, Xaro Xhoan Daxos, vouches for Daenerys's people through a blood oath, and they are allowed inside. =In the Stormlands= Littlefinger discusses the siege of King's Landing with Renly, and Margaery rebuffs Littlefinger's questions. Littlefinger meets with Catelyn, who is enraged at the sight of him, and tells her the Lannisters want to trade Sansa and Arya for Jaime. As a gesture of goodwill, he brings her Ned Stark's remains. Renly and Catelyn parley with Stannis and Melisandre. Renly refuses Stannis's offer to surrender in exchange for becoming his heir, and is given until sunrise to reconsider or be destroyed. At night, Stannis orders Davos to take Melisandre ashore in secret. Once ashore, Melisandre reveals she is, impossibly, in late-stage pregnancy and gives birth to a horrific, shadowy figure, which disappears in a cloud of smoke. Production =Writing= Richard Madden's performances in the first season convinced the writers to expand Robb's storyline and show his campaign in the West. \\"Garden of Bones\\" was the first of two episodes written by Vanessa Taylor, the season's addition to the writing staff. The script was based on chapters 27, 30, 32, 33 and 43 (Arya VI, Tyrion VII, Catelyn III, Sansa III, and Davos II) of George R. R. Martin's novel A Clash of Kings. The episode introduced many significant deviations from the original material. One of the most significant affects the character of Talisa, who is based on the novel's Jeyne Westerling, but is given a very different background and motivations (in the books she is the daughter of a minor noble sworn to the Lannisters, while the show has her a foreign lady from the Free City of Volantis). The producers acknowledge that Robb's storyline is \\"one of the places where novels diverge pretty drastically from television.\\" They felt that the book's approach of having him off-scene most of the time and portraying his deeds in the battlefield only from second-hand reports was not going to work in a visual medium. Also, the talent and magnetism that Richard Madden demonstrated during the first season convinced them to expand his presence and portray his love story onscreen. Other deviations include the early arrival of Littlefinger to the Tyrell army and his interactions with Catelyn (in the books he arrives much later, after she has left), the merger of Melisandre's two shadow creatures into a single one (the Siege of Storm's End and the character of Ser Cortnay Penrose were dropped from the show) and having Tywin discover Arya's gender and make her his cupbearer (in the books Arya abandons her identity as a boy and is assigned to work in the kitchens). Also, several scenes were created for the episode, including a scene with a sadistic Joffrey and prostitutes and one in which Daenerys is received at the gates of Qarth. =Casting= Charles Dance returns in \\"Garden of Bones\\" and is promoted to the main cast. This episode marks the first appearance of the recurring actress Oona Chaplin. When the casting was announced in August 2011, HBO only credited the character \\"Jeyne\\", refusing to give any surname. Since there were several characters in the books with that name, this led to speculation about whom Chaplin would be playing. Eventually it was revealed that the character was based in Jeyne Westerling, and by the time the shooting began, she was renamed Talisa Maegyr. However, Jeyne Westerling and Talisa Maegyr are entirely different characters. In the novels, Jeyne is a member of the noble House Westerling, whose lands are located in the Westerlands. On a mission to take their castle, Robb finds out what Theon has done to his brothers, and Jeyne \\"comforts\\" him in his grief. Robb, not wanting to be dishonourable, marries her. Talisa, on the other hand, is a healer from the Eastern city of Volantis, whom Robb meets on the battlefield. Additionally, Jeyne is not introduced until the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords, while Talisa is introduced in this season (roughly adapted from the series' second book, A Clash of Kings). Chaplin has read the original books and was already a big fan of the show before being cast. The new setting of Qarth is also introduced and with it three roles cast among The Thirteen, the governing body of the city: * Xaro Xhoan Daxos played by Nonso Anozie. In the books, Xaro is a native of Qarth and is white, but in the series Xaro is an immigrant from the Summer Isles and is black. Many other traits of the original character, such as his homosexuality and constant crying, have been removed in the adaptation. Anozie revealed that he had auditioned for another role for season one, and HBO wanted to cast him, but a schedule conflict prevented him from appearing. * The Spice King played by Nicholas Blane. The character has been created for the show, but he embodies the book's Ancient Guild of Spicers, one of the merchant factions that rival Xaro Xhoan Daxos. * Pyat Pree played by Ian Hanmore, who has no lines in this episode but is present in the reception at the gates. Charles Dance returns as Tywin Lannister and is added to the main cast list and included in the opening credits (he had been a recurring guest star during the first season). The episode marks the first appearance of Ian Whyte as Gregor Clegane. Clegane had been previously played by Conan Stevens in season one. Whyte had previously played the White Walker seen in the first episode, as well as in the second-season episode \\"The Night Lands.\\" Though Whyte did not return as Gregor for season four (the role was taken over by Icelandic weightlifter Haf√æ√≥r J√∫l√≠us Bj√∂rnsson), he played the giant Wun Wun in the season five episodes \\"Hardhome\\" and \\"The Dance of Dragons.\\" =Filming locations= The closing scene of the episode was filmed at the Cushendun Caves. Production for \\"Garden of Bones\\" continued to use Belfast's The Paint Hall Studios for all interior shots and the set constructed at the Larrybane Bay for the scenes at Renly's camp. The episode also introduced numerous external locations: the gates of Qarth were constructed in Dubac quarry near Dubrovnik, on cliffs over the Adriatic Sea; the scenes in the caves below Renly's camp were filmed at the Cushendun Caves, County Antrim; and the set representing the huge ruined castle of Harrenhal was built near Banbridge, County Down. =Staging and props= The closing scene with Melisandre birthing the shadow creature was shot at night, in a real cave and in cold weather. The scene was very taxing for actress Carice van Houten, who had to be naked and scream loudly during the labour. For this reason, the scene could not be rehearsed before filming. To make van Houten appear pregnant the show's prosthetic artist Conor O'Sullivan prepared a fake belly that could be operated by pneumatics to simulate the childbirth. The creature was added using CGI. Maisie Dee, the pornographic actress who played the abused prostitute Daisy, described her experience with Game of Thrones on her blog. She wrote that her character was unnamed during the shooting of her first scene (her trailer was labeled \\"Nubile Whore\\") but graduated to having a name later. The scene of her abuse at Joffrey's orders took a day to shoot, using alternately a real leather belt and a soft prop to depict Daisy being whipped by Ros. Reception =Ratings= The number of viewers of the first airing remained steady for the fourth week in a row, reaching 3.7 million viewers. In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 0.8 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week. =Critical reception= \\"Garden of Bones\\" received critical acclaim from most commentators. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 97% with an average rating of 8.41 out of 10, based on 29 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Garden of Bones\\" continues GoT's stellar second season with a bleak, disturbing, and powerful episode that culminates in a bizarre confirmation that the night is indeed dark and full of terrors. IGN's Matt Fowler gave it a 9 out of 10, calling it \\"a ferocious treat, overloaded with misery, torture and a total 'WTF!' black magic-fueled ending.\\" Both David Sims and Emily VanDerWerff, two reviewers from The A.V. Club, rated it with a B+. TV Fanatic's Matt Richenthal also considered it the best of the season but was worried about the ending and how magic would be dealt with in the show. There was consensus in considering the episode the most violent and gruesome to date. Writing for The Guardian, Sarah Hughes summed it up: \\"This was an exceptionally violent episode. It featured: one death by Direwolf; one graphic foot amputation; two separate uses of a crossbow as a weapon of intimidation; the continued humiliation of Sansa, stripped and beaten on Joffrey's orders; the brutal whipping of a whore again at Joffrey's command; two torture scenes (one of which was interrupted); a couple of backhanders; several dead bodies and one (slightly camp) Qartheen blood oath.\\" Many commentators praised the acting in this episode, highlighting Michelle Fairley in the scene where Catelyn receives her late husband's bones and Peter Dinklage when Tyrion confronts his cousin Lancel. On Talisa's introduction, Myles McNutt at Cultural Learnings wrote: \\"The problem is that I‚Äôm pretty sure any viewer who watched this would know immediately that she is intended as Robb‚Äôs love interest, and there‚Äôs a simplicity to that which I object to.\\" =Accolades= This episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series.

Jinshi degree holder (1745), secretary to the Qianlong Emperor.  Background  Zhuang lineage traced itself from the N.Song refugees who had moved south being pressed by the Jurchen invasion. During the Ming dynasty, Zhuangs grew up tp become an influential local elite sympathizing with the Donglin movement (however not recorded as its direct participants).Elman, 47-8 Though some members retired from public life during the Ming-Qing transition, the lineage continued to prosper and produced an outstanding amount of the jinshi degree holders: 29 during the whole timespan of the Qing (after producing 6 during the Ming).Elman, 53 Father (Zhuang Zhu) and uncle (Zhuang Kai) of Cunyu were Hanlin academicians. As reported by Dai Wang in \\"Yanshi xueji\\", Cunyu's father was influenced by the practical teaching of Yan Yuan È¢úÂÖÉ (1635-1704). In the 1750s the lineage was well established politically: Zhuang Yugong was the governor of Suzhou, while Cunyu became a member of the Grand Secretariat in the capital. Such educational success was bound to the private lineage school of Zhuangs, the Dongpo Academy (named after Su Shi). For generations, Zhuangs stood in the intermarriage with another powerful lineage of the region, the Lius.  Activity and main concepts  Zhuang Cunyu became the major voice in the practical scholarship of the Zhuang lineage. Cunyu continued the tradition of Zhuangs by studying astronomy, medicine, geography, water conservation, water control, legal statutes, and mathematical calculation methods. Unlike proponents of the Han learning, Cunyu was never interested in philology per se. For him, it was always only a means for the political goal. Cunyu supported use of the Old Text Shujing despite some of its chapters being held as philologically suspicious: in his view, they were essential for social and political order.Elman, 105 He also advocated reform against cheating at the imperial examinations, not only among the Chinese, but also inside the bannermen section. Despite censorial criticism, his position was supported by Qianlong himself. Over the clash with rising power of Heshen (1746-1799), Cunyu left the court (1786)Elman, 109 and committed himself to textual studies that would not be known until the 1820s.Elman, 114 In the Chunqiu zhengci (Correcting terms in the Spring and Autumn Annals), Zhuang used interpretation of Gongyang zhuan for the veiled attack on state-protected profiteering: \\"Yes! Yes! The position of ruler is what licentious men use to gain the upper hand. Therefore, the Annals, with regard to a time when secret dealings determine life and death, tried mightily to prevent such [usurpations of power].\\"Elman, 115.

It has a transmission capacity of 2,200 MW and was expected to cost ¬£1bn. The link entered operational service on 7 December 2017 at a reduced capacity of 900 MW pending further work at Hunterston. It entered full use on 16 October 2018. Link It consists of of cable, of which is underwater. It is the first subsea link at 600 kV. Operating at this higher voltage increases transmission capacity and reduces transmission losses in the cable, reducing power loss from transmission and two AC/DC conversions to under 3%. There are two cables, which in shallow water are laid in a paired bundle, and in deep water are laid about 30 metres apart, generally buried about 1.5 metres below the seabed. The cables are jointed in 120 km sections. Line commutated converter technology is used at each HVDC converter to maximise the amount of electrical power, generated predominantly by renewable sources in Scotland, which can be transferred across the B6 boundaryThe UK transmission grid is often analysed in terms of flows across fictitious \\"boundaries\\" which divide the network in two. Where the lines which across a boundary struggle to accommodate projected flows, the boundary needs strengthening. Though most boundaries do not correspond to geographic or political features, the B6 boundary runs along the England/Scotland border. in parallel to two existing double-circuit AC transmission lines. This type of HVDC conversion technology means that large filter halls are required at each converter station. Gas-insulated switchgear is used at the Hunterston converter station to save space. Routing the connection through the Irish Sea, as opposed to a land-based route, reduced the impact of the link on the visual environment and prevented the rising cost of land affecting the cost of the project. For the given distance, it was necessary to use a DC transmission technology for a subsea route, as the capacitive current required for an AC connection would be too high. Due to the proximity of the converter stations to the coastline, a decision was taken to host electrical infrastructure within built structures in order to reduce the effects of the coastal air on the equipment. Power can be transferred in either direction (which might become more likely due to the closure of Longannet power station), but it is necessary for the link to be offline for a sufficient time prior to reversing the direction. Mass impregnated non-draining (MIND) cables are used in a bipolar arrangement, but no sea- or earth-return path is permitted for environmental reasons, meaning that both cables must be in service for the link to be operational. The cables are spaced apart to minimise thermal interference, but not so far as to materially impact any marine life which navigates using the magnetic field of the Earth. Completion was delayed a year due to cable manufacturing problems. The link has since suffered a number of outages due to cable faults, which typically take several weeks to locate and fix. A fault in the southern land cable on 19 February 2019 resulted in an outage until 22 March. A further extended outage from 6 April 2019 was caused by a fault in the undersea cable. A third outage commenced on 10 January 2020, leading to Ofgem investigating. Engineers working on the project discovered the almost intact wreck of the World War I German submarine UB-85.

It was a variant of the Pepsi cola range. In some markets it was sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, sugar, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose,Official Site for PepsiCo Beverage Information  Find and marketed toward drinkers of full-calorie Pepsi, and those who do not enjoy the taste of Diet Pepsi, Pepsi ONE, Pepsi Max, and other diet colas. On June 25, 2013, PepsiCo informed their Facebook readers that the new formulation of Pepsi Next no longer contained aspartame, the artificial sweetener used in many diet soft drinks including Diet Pepsi, hence some bottles sold in the US read 'aspartame free'. However, the continued presence of acesulfame potassium means this version of the product still contained artificial sweeteners. In other marketing areas, including Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand, where it was marketed as having \\"30% less sugar\\", Pepsi Next was sweetened using an extract from stevia and had no artificial sweeteners. Creation Pepsi Edge, Pepsi's first mid- calorie cola, was introduced in 2004, and discontinued only two years later. PepsiCo, towards the end of the 2000s found new interest in mid-calorie beverages, and then released G2, a version of Gatorade with less than half the calories, and in the year 2011, Trop50, a juice blend, with 50% the calories of regular juice. In September 2007, PepsiCo filed for trademarks in the US Patent and Trademark Office, for \\"Pepsi Next\\", and \\"Diet Pepsi Next\\". In 2010, PepsiCo began to test Pepsi Next via market research groups. In June 2011, PepsiCo announced that Pepsi Next was going to be moved into two test markets, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. After testing, on February 27, 2012, PepsiCo announced the launch of Pepsi Next. In the Australian market, Pepsi Next was bottled by Schweppes Australia and is sweetened by stevia which reduces the sugar content by 30% compared to regular Pepsi. Pepsi Next was first introduced in France in March 2013, and in Finland and Canada in March 2014. Stevia extract is used in all three markets. Reception and taste One site stated that, Although it contains three artificial sweeteners and has 60 percent fewer calories than regular Pepsi, it's really hard to taste anything \\"diet\\" about Pepsi Next. But it's not quite like regular Pepsi; it's less syrupy and smoother. There are also differences in flavor between Pepsi Next and original Pepsi. I thought Pepsi Next had a slightly stronger cola flavor and, for some reason, my taste buds perceived a hint of lemon. According to the BevReview, the initial taste of Pepsi Next is similar to original Pepsi, but this is followed by the less pleasant taste of artificial sweeteners. Marketing After the launch of Pepsi Next, a television commercial was launched that depicted a young couple, enjoying Pepsi Next. Eva Longoria, Paula Patton, and Nicki Minaj all have featured in advertisements for Pepsi Next. Paula Patton has filmed a television commercial for Pepsi Next, as has Nicki Minaj. A series of Internet and print ads were made, with a picture of a can of Pepsi Next, with the words: Real Cola Taste, 60% Less Sugar, Drink It To Believe It. In the 2013 Super Bowl, Pepsi used its advertising minutes right before the halftime show (which featured Beyonce, a \\"brand ambassador\\" for Pepsi) to advertise Pepsi Next. The presentation by Pepsi (the halftime show plus the advertising) was unique in that it featured photos of Pepsi customers. Pepsi had asked customers to send in photos before the Super Bowl.

It relies on the causality principle applied to psychic occurrences in which nothing happens by chance or by accidental arbitrary ways. It is one of the central concepts of psychoanalysis. Thus, slips of the tongue, forgetting an individual's name, and any other verbal associations or mistakes are assumed to have psychological meaning. Psychoanalytic therapists will generally probe clients and have them elaborate on why something ‚Äúpopped into‚Äù their head or why they may have forgotten someone's name rather than ignoring the material. The therapist then analyze this discussion for clues revealing unconscious connections to the slip of verbal association. Psychic determinism is related to the overarching concept of determinism, specifically in terms of human actions. Therapists who adhere to the belief in psychic determinism assume that human action and decisions are predetermined and are not necessarily under their own control.  Origin  Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt, 1921 In 1901 Sigmund Freud published The Psychopathology of Everyday Life in which he detailed the importance of generally trivial or overlooked details in therapy sessions. It was in this work that Freud began to use the term ‚ÄúFehlleistungen‚Äù to refer to seemingly unintended slips of the tongue. Freud interpreted these slips of the tongue as the result of unconscious desires or impulses. During psychoanalytic therapy sessions Freud would dissect and question participants if they made a mental lapse or a slip of the tongue, as he believed this would allow him an understanding of the unconscious motives of his patient. Although the ‚ÄúFreudian slip‚Äù is considered the most popularized example of psychic determinism from Freud's work, this concept of determinism is not the only one. The term psychic determinism encompasses other forms of mental lapses such as forgetting someone's name.  Clinical setting  Psychic determinism was an extremely important feature of free association during psychoanalytic therapy, and still holds significance for many psychoanalysts today. Free association was developed by Sigmund Freud as an alternative to the hypnotic method for treating neurotic patients. During free association patients are encouraged to state whatever comes to their mind during the therapy session without censoring themselves. During free association the client may at times have an image come to mind or say something that seems odd or unintentional. Instead of overlooking this, the therapist would begin to delve into the slip and determine the underlying cause of it, which Freud claimed as generally some unconscious impulse. During psychoanalysis and free association the patient generally lies on a couch with the analyst sitting close but slightly out of view. The patient begins the session by reporting her thoughts as they come to her, no matter how illogical, bizarre, or base they may seem. = Example =  Patient  \\"I am thinking of the fluffy clouds I seem to see with my very eyes. They are white and pearly. The sky is full of clouds but a few azure patches can still be seen here and there... Clouds keep changing their shapes. They are fluid because they are condensed water particles... I am thinking I may have an obsession about this water. The doctor has told me I am dehydrated; there's not enough water in my body. He suggested I should drink 2-3 liters of water every day. Mineral water or tea! I thought there is a connection between my need to add salt to my food and thirst. My body has found itself a pretext - salty food - to make me drink more water. I have a lot of thoughts about the manifestations of my body, which seem logical and aim at inner balance. Everybody has in fact got an inner physician in oneself. What need is there of an outside doctor then? If you allow yourself lie at the will of your free inclinations, with no assumptions whatsoever, you will have the intuition of making things that may surprise you, nevertheless useful to your body and securing your health and high spirits. I read somewhere that one can be one's own doctor... Everybody can be one's own doctor.\\"  Therapist analysis  \\"We put a stop here to the flow of our patient's associations. We may notice these are indirectly related to the relationship with her therapist. Her associations related to the spontaneous medicine of her body lead to the idea that no physician is in fact necessary. The patient thinks the psychoanalyst has in fact no contribution to her well being, that she could very well do without one. We must admit the series of free associations produced by the patient are somehow related to her present circumstances, including a recent reality: her psychoanalytic therapy. The novelty of the therapy, the relationship with the psychoanalyst, automatically induces thoughts, remarks, more or less recent memories. The fact that, during her therapy, the patient alludes to a doctor, who had in fact done nothing to help her, is no mere chance. This memory can be related to the present circumstance and it may be translated in the patient's skepticism concerning the utility of this analytic therapy. Nevertheless, this skepticism has an even older history, bringing to the fore the patient's relationship to her mother, when still a child, and dependent on her parents' support.\\" = Criticisms = Criticism of free association is generally not on the clinical evidence, but the clinical data and the suggestion that they might be a patient's responses to the suggestions and expectations of the analyst rather than evidence of subconscious thought. Also there is concern that there is no way of ensuring that the analyst is capable of distinguishing between the patients' actual memories and imagined memories constructed due to the influence of the analyst's leading questions. Because of this, it is believed that this approach can cause harm to the patients mental state. Case Example 1: Elisa Elisa claimed to have been sexually victimized by a neighbor when she was between 14 and 18 years of age. She maintained she repressed all memories of this abuse until her therapist questioned her about the possibility. After developing the memories, she sued the neighbor, who denied the abuse. Elisa came from a troubled and conflicted family and perceived her family as nonsupportive. After high school she worked as a secretary and attended community college part-time. She met her future husband when she was 18 and they were married two years later. Her life was complicated by rheumatoid arthritis which, although not life-threatening, was painful and difficult, and she was eventually hospitalized for depression. At the time we saw her she had had a total of five hospitalizations for emotional problems. The hospital records mention her anger and frustration over the chronic pain along with problems with her marriage and with her family, particularly her mother. But until three years ago she was employed and going to school part-time. Elisa began seeing Dr. Smith three years ago. Dr. Smith's case notes indicate that he questioned her a number of times about abuse and that she initially denied it. But he believed she had the symptoms of sexual abuse, so he persisted questioning her until she eventually agreed that her neighbor had \\"touched\\" her. She didn't have many memories of this at first, but after a few months she had \\"flashbacks,\\" and \\"frightening things\\" came into her mind. She eventually recovered memories of her neighbor regularly grabbing her and kissing and fondling her when her parents were at work. She claimed that the abuse went on for four years until shortly before she met her future husband, but she claimed to have no memory of it until Dr. Smith began questioning her. Elisa saw Dr. Smith, who also managed her medications, three times a week and was on a large number of mood-altering drugs. She became progressively more dysfunctional until she was unable to work. She spent most days in bed, except when she was at therapy, while her husband did the house cleaning, shopping, cooking, and laundry. Her inability to cope with these tasks was due to her emotional problems rather than her physical ones, which were currently under control. Dr. Smith diagnosed her as multiple personality disorder and had this diagnosis confirmed by an MPD \\"expert\\" in a nearby city. It was hard for Elisa to accept that she had MPD and she denied it until Dr. Smith told her, \\"there was no doubt that I had multiple personalities.\\" Eventually she developed seven different personalities and believed that her MPD resulted from the abuse by her neighbor. Elisa reported that she screams, shouts and throws and breaks things when she is angry and that she has one personality who is very violent. She said that the multiple personalities were a coping mechanism for when she is in a difficult or stressful situation. Dr. Smith's case notes indicate that the alters appeared regularly in their therapy sessions. She hallucinated monsters in the form of a man who was following her. She became frightened and hid and then \\"Chrissy\\" came out. She also heard voices that said bad things about her. When this happened, \\"Judy\\" came out and punished her by cutting her arms and her legs. She said, \\"I don't cut, Judy cuts.\\" Criticism of the case During our evaluation, Elisa was appropriate and cooperative. RU spoke to her for four hours and at no time did she display any sign of cognitive slippage, delusions or hallucinations, irrational behavior, or changing personalities. This was despite the stress of the evaluation. She also reported seeing the neighbor in a parking lot at lunch time, but no alters emerged to protect her from either RU or the neighbor. Elisa's psychological test results indicated significant exaggeration of problems. We interpreted this as a learned response to therapy and her hospitalizations rather than deliberate malingering. She was told that she had severe psychological problems, including MPD, and she learned to play the role of a disturbed and dysfunctional MPD patient, especially when around people who expected this from her. After therapy three times a week, several hospitalizations, and constant talking about how the personalities helped her cope and how the abuse damaged her permanently, this became her reality.\\"[8]  See also  * Hypnosis  References  Category:Psychological theories Category:Psychoanalysis Category:Determinism ","title":"Psychic determinism"},{"id":"35519649","title":"Wesley Korir"},{"id":"35519654","text":"Sertaneja and Sertanejo are Brazilian terms that may refer to: *Sertanejo, a resident of the Sert√£o (equivalent to a United States cowboy in frontier times) *Sertaneja, Paran√°, a municipality in Paran√°, Brazil *M√∫sica sertaneja, a musical genre in Brazil (known as Sertanejo) *Sertanejo universit√°rio, another musical genre in Brazil *O sertanejo, a novel by the Brazilian writer Jos√© de Alencar *Viola Sertaneja, a stringed musical instrument from North- eastern Brazil *Sertanejo, nickname of Felipe Arantes, Brazilian mixed martial artist ","title":"Sertaneja"},{"id":"35519667","text":"The L√∂wensk√∂ld Ring () is a 1925 novel by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerl√∂f.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. History Escanaba in the early 1900s experienced an economic boom due to its central location in the Upper Peninsula, which created a natural transportation hub moving iron ore from railroad cars onto ships. In fact, the city's population grew from 9,500 in 1900 to 14,500 in 1913. At about that time, a stockholder's corporation, supported in part by local businessmen, formed to construct a new hotel in the city. The Delta Hotel opened in January, 1914, and served as Escanaba's best hotel for many years. In 1922 the hotel was sold to Clyde J. Burns, an Escanaba businessman and politician. Burns and his wife managed the hotel until 1957, when Burns' widow sold it to her nephew, David W. Walch. In 1962, the hotel closed, and Walch sold it to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette. The hotel was converted into a nursing home, known as the Bishop Noa Home for Senior Citizens, in 1962-63, at which time an addition was constructed. The Bishop Noa Home moved from the building in 1992. The building remained vacant for a short period, and was then purchased and renovated. In 1994, the Hereford and Hops, a brewpub and restaurant, opened in first floor the building. The upper floors were converted into thirty-two apartments. As of 2018, the Hereford and Hops still occupied the building. Description The Delta Hotel is a five-story, high Classical Revival structure. The main facades have a rusticated exterior at the first floor level, and a decorative belt resembling a cornice below the fifth-floor windows. There is paneled brickwork between the windows on the fifth floor level, and a parapet across the top that was added when the original main cornice was removed.

Her personal best of 2:18:58 had been the Ethiopian national record for the event from 2012 to 2017. She won the 2011 Amsterdam Marathon and the 2012 Rotterdam Marathon. She won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics with a time of 2:23:07, a new Olympic record. Biography A cousin of 2000 Olympic marathon champion Gezahegne Abera, Tiki was born in Jijiga, a town renowned for producing top runners. She began competing in road races in Ethiopia and came fourth at the 2004 Great Ethiopian Run. She went to Catalonia in Spain in 2006 and made her debut over the half marathon distance, including wins in Matar√≥ and Terrassa.Tiki Gelana. Tilastopaja. Retrieved 22 April 2012.

She travelled to Japan in 2007 and won the 10K at the Sanyo Road Race ‚Äì her time of 31:54 minutes made her the third fastest Ethiopian that year. She won the 2008 Women First 5K in Addis Ababa in March, then came fourth at the high-profile World 10K Bangalore in May. She debuted on the European track and field circuit that summer and set a 5000 metres best of 15:17.74 minutes at the Internationales Stadionfest and a 10,000 metres best of 31:27.80 minutes at the Ostrava Golden Spike. In late 2008, she took sixth place at the Delhi Half Marathon with a time of 1:10:22 hours, but she was two minutes slower at the 2009 RAK Half Marathon, finishing 16th. but managed second place behind Abebu Gelan at the Virginia Beach Half Marathon in her American debut. Her marathon debut followed in October at the Dublin Marathon and in a close finish she took third place on the podium. In 2010, she came fourth at both the Los Angeles Marathon and the Dublin Marathon, although she improved her best to 2:29:53 hours. The 2011 Amsterdam Marathon marked a breakthrough for Tiki as she won the race in a time of 2:22:08 hours ‚Äì almost eight minutes faster than her previous best and an improvement upon Gete Wami's nine-year-old course record. At the end of that year she returned to Ethiopia, where she came runner-up at the Great Ethiopian Run and third at the Ethiopian Clubs Cross Country Championships. She improved her personal best at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon in February 2012, going unchallenged to win the race in 1:08:48 hours. She broke the Ethiopian record at the 2012 Rotterdam Marathon, completing a solo run of 2:18:58 hours to win the race almost five minutes ahead of runner-up Valeria Straneo. This made her the fourth fastest woman ever over the distance. She was selected to represent Ethiopia in the Olympic marathon as a result. At the London 2012 Olympics she won the gold medal at the marathon with an Olympic record time of 2:23:07 hours, in spite of rain throughout the race and a fall at the water station. After the Olympics she ran a personal best for the half marathon, recording 1:07:48 for third at the Great North Run, then ran a 15 km best of 48:09 minutes at the Zevenheuvelenloop (finishing behind Olympic 10,000 m champion Tirunesh Dibaba at both races).

Competing in the 2013 London Marathon, Gelana was knocked to the ground in a collision with wheelchair racer Josh Cassidy at the 15 km feeding station. Although able to resume, she dropped off the lead pace in the second half of the race and finished in 16th place in a time of 2:36:55 hours. The incident prompted London Marathon organisers to alter starting arrangements for the 2014 edition to allow wheelchair athletes to start ahead of the women's race. Gelana was selected for the Ethiopian team to contest the marathon at the 2013 world championships in Moscow, but dropped out of the race held in hot and humid conditions after just 5 km. Her early withdrawal, together with that of teammate Meseret Hailu, prompted the Ethiopian Athletics Federation to ask the pair to submit written explanations for their actions.Watta, Evelyn (13 August 2013).

Beginning in 1869, in his Barren Hill Nursery in Nevada City, Gillet cultivated his own imported scion wood and home-grown nursery stock, experimented with grafting and hybridizing, and continually wrote articles on horticulture and his plant selections, while remaining active in Nevada City civic affairs.Grass Valley Morning Union, January 28, 1908, p. 5 Publishing his own nursery catalog for 37 years and advertising widely, he sold his walnuts, filberts (hazelnuts), chestnuts, prunes, figs, strawberries, grapes, peaches, cherries, citrus and dozens of other fruit and nut varieties throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. The commercial walnut variety \\"Felix Gillet\\" was named in his honor. Early life and career Little is known of Gillet's early life in France and before he settled in Nevada City around 1859. Published the day after Gillet died, a Grass Valley Morning Union newspaper article stated he was born in Roucheford [sic] ‚Äî probably Rochefort ‚Äî a port town in southwestern France several miles up the Charente River from the Atlantic Ocean. He had three sisters. At age 16, in 1851, he reputedly spent time at a naval school in Rochefort and made several trans-Atlantic crossings working in the shipping industry. By 1852, he was in Boston, where he learned the barber trade. He possibly was a houseguest of prominent Bostonians Samuel Gridley Howe and Julia Ward Howe,\\"Felix Gillet\\" by C. E. Parsons, Nevada County Historical Society Bulletin, Vol. 16, No. 4, Nov. 1962 who hosted visits by some European immigrants seeking a new life in America. In 1858, Gillet was a barber in San Jose, California, where French orchardists were establishing large fruit and nut farms. In February 1859, at age 24, he moved to the prosperous gold mining town of Nevada (City) in the Sierra Nevada foothills.arrival book, Nevada County Court records Gillet opened a barbershop on Commercial Street, just below Pine Street, in downtown Nevada City. He also sold French finery such as pens, stationery, toys and novelties. He would operate the shop until 1882. Soon after arriving in Nevada City, Gillet became acquainted with an important influence, Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Ducray, who with his younger brother Jean Claude had mined gold and farmed in Nevada City since 1850. As young men, the Ducray brothers had quickly made money in mining interests, and then established large, mostly self-sufficient French-style farms at the edge of Nevada City. Gillet admired Jean-Baptiste Ducray's idyllic 35-acre farm of fruit and nut trees, grape vines, beehives and roses, which had been reclaimed from land mine-stripped to bedrock. To investigate the nursery trade and French horticulture, Gillet returned to France for 10 months in 1864, then returned to Nevada City. In February 1865, he reopened his shop. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1866. From 1866 until 1880, Gillet also filed eight gold mining claims.Mining Register, Nevada County There is no record of what he did with them. In either the fall of 1869 or August 1870, Gillet purchased with $250 in gold coin 16 acres of land just outside town and started establishing a farm and plant nursery.Nevada County Deeds, Book 37, p. 34 Like that of his friends the Ducrays, Gillet's land was mostly granite bedrock recently surfaced-mined, timbered and left barren. While friends cast doubt on his success as a nurseryman, Gillet built a house and established his Barren Hill Nursery while continuing to run the barbershop. Gillet then spent $3,000 ($49,180 in 2011, adjusting for inflation) on a large order of walnut, filbert, chestnut, mulberry, prune, and fig trees from France. He risked his personal wealth that his imported scion wood and nursery stock would arrive alive, and would not fail to grow in Nevada County. It's not known how the live plants were shipped, but the recent completion of the transcontinental railroad would have significantly shortened the transportation time, if Gillet had his plants shipped from Europe to the East Coast, then freighted by rail to California. In the spring of 1871, after he spent a year and a half growing and propagating his imported fruit and nut trees, and carefully observing the climate and topographic conditions that produced the best results in his nursery and elsewhere, Gillet began selling nursery stock. His catalog included his first important introductions to California agriculture ‚Äî soft-shelled Franquette, Mayette and other walnuts from France.The Walnut Germplasm Collection of the University of California, Davis; \\"A Description of the Collection and a History of the Breeding Program,\\" Eugene F. Serr and Harold I. Forde, et al., Report No. 13, July 1994 These cultivars were unknown in California and Gillet's stock became widely planted and thrived. Open-pollinated seedlings of these early introductions would later produce superior cultivars still grown today. Gillet also imported, propagated and hybridized many other fruit and nut trees, grapes, berries and ornamentals. Paying (or possibly trading) for advertising space to promote his plant stock, he became a regular horticultural writer in regional newspapers and became knowledgeable about still-pioneering horticultural efforts throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. From at least the late 1860s, he also persistently championed domestic sericulture and promoted planting mulberry trees as hosts for silkworms, despite little evidence it was economically viable in the United States. In 1870, Gillet promoted the silky floss of common milkweed as a textile fiber. Gillet's advertisements and writings in horticultural journals, such as the popular weekly Pacific Rural Press (published in San Francisco), established his reputation for offering superior French varieties of fruit and nut trees. Besides importing stock, Gillet made selections of superior offspring he grew in his nursery. He experimented with grafting varieties of fruits to hardy wild specimens, and specialized in introducing varieties that thrived in poor soil conditions, which ensured that his introductions would succeed in many different western locations. In the mid-1870s, Gillet's work with strawberries resulted in his introduction of new varieties and his publication in 1876 of an authoritative 32-page booklet on \\"fragriculture,\\" the growing of strawberries. A January 1877 edition of the California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences stated Gillet sold 48 varieties of strawberries. Gillet's next notable plant introduction to California (in 1883) was a free stone dessert prune from the Clairac region of France, which he called \\"Clairac Mammoth\\" (a.k.a. \\"Imperial Epineuse\\"). At a time when most California fruit was consumed fresh, dried and canned dessert prunes were a popular, expensive import from France. California prune growers as early as 1854 had attempted to cut into this lucrative market by importing and growing French prune trees, but struggled to copy French drying methods. Gillet competed with John Rock, another well-known nurseryman in Niles (Fremont), to market hardier prune trees that produced very large fruit. Gillet introduced his Clairac prune trees two years before Rock. Both men crossed or grafted the French prunes with wild California plums to produce a variety that was more drought-tolerant and hardier in upland orchards, than in lowlands such as the Santa Clara Valley, then the prune growing center of California.\\"The California Fruits and How To Grow Them,\\" Pacific Rural Press, 1919, 8th edition, by Edward James Wickson, Professor of Horticulture Emeritus, College of Agriculture, University of California Gillet's last and most enduring plant introduction was in 1885, when he sold a large quantity of filbert (hazelnut) stock to orchardists in Oregon's Willamette Valley. Although filberts had been grown in Oregon since the 1850s, Gillet's imported \\"Barcelona\\" and \\"DuChilly\\" varieties proved to be superior. The \\"Barcelona\\" variety remains the most widely planted in Oregon,\\"Historical Notes on Hazelnuts in Oregon,\\" K. E. Hummer, International Society for Horticulture Science which today produces 98 percent of the filbert crop in the United States. Ironically, filberts do not grow well in the Sierra foothills, where Gillet propagated them. Reputation and Rivals In 1881, Gillet became a member of the Nurserymen's Committee of the first California Fruit Growers' Convention. Gillet and fellow pioneer nurseryman W.B. West of Stockton were members of the first California Horticultural Commission, a forerunner of the California Department of Food and Agriculture. After just a decade of importing, cultivating, experimenting, selling and prolifically writing about fruits, nuts and berries, Gillet was a respected figure in California horticulture and regarded as an unsurpassed expert in French varieties of fruits and nuts. Gillet's reputation also was created, in part, by tireless self-promotion. In a Feb. 9. 1884 advertisement in the Pacific Rural Press, Gillet touted his nursery as \\"the finest nut-bearing tree nursery in the U.S.\\" His catalog at that time offered 17 varieties of walnut, including eight grafted from European varieties; seven varieties of chestnuts, six varieties of filberts, seven varieties of prunes, 55 varieties of English gooseberries, and 107 varieties of grapes. These numbers would increase; at one point, the nursery offered 241 types of grapes, including several varieties previously unknown in California. Gillet's regional renown, however, would be eclipsed by Luther Burbank, whose 1893 descriptive catalog \\"New Creations in Fruits and Flowers\\" stunned the horticultural world with the introduction of many previously unknown fruit, vegetable and flower hybrids. The catalog made Burbank internationally famous. It is not known if Burbank and Gillet corresponded, or met, but they undoubtedly were aware of each other and were commercial competitors. The 1897-98 biennial report of the California State Board of Horticulture comparatively evaluated Gillet's \\"Clairac Mammoth\\"/\\"Imperial Epineuse\\" prune with Burbank's \\"Sugar.\\" In a paper presented at the 1904 Northwest Fruit Growers' Association, Gillet acknowledged Burbank's \\"Sugar\\" prune variety, but noted that his imported French trees produced a superior dessert prune and sent the delegation samples for taste comparison. Another Gillet rival was John Rock (born Johann Fels), whose large, Fremont-based California Nursery Company (established in 1865) introduced French prune scion wood in 1886 and claimed to sell the best varieties for dessert prunes. Gillet had made the same claim since 1883. For several years, Gillet's advertisements denounced unnamed rivals, whom he said fraudulently claimed his nursery stock as their own. Of the German-born nurseryman, Luther Burbank said, \\"John Rock is the most learned man in his profession to be found in California.\\"http://www.fremontica.com/roadside/cnco.htm Civic and later life Besides tending his nursery and gardens, Gillet experimented with wine making, did book binding and wrote essays and columns about horticulture, astronomy, navigation, and California Indians. He closed his barbershop in 1882 to devote his full energy to his nursery. Possibly due to his admiration of abolitionists Samuel and Julia Ward Howe, Gillet was among the few whites who, in the Reconstruction Era, publicly supported equal rights for Nevada County's few African-Americans ‚Äî some of whom were former slaves.\\"Nevada County's Black Pioneers\\" by Pat Jones; Nevada County Historical Society Bulletin, Vol. 39, No. 3, July 1985 Gillet's racial tolerance, however, did not extend to the Chinese, whose businesses in Nevada City were adjacent to his own. Gillet was one local leader of the Workingmen's Party of California, a nativist labor organization whose agitation against Chinese immigrant workers on the Central Pacific Railroad led to the federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In April 1881, Nevada City passed an ordinance that \\"all Chinese shall be removed from the Nevada City within 60 days.\\"\\"The Nevada City Chinese Quarter, 1860-1900\\" by Wallace Hagaman, Nevada County Historical Society Bulletin, Vol. 62, No. 4, Oct. 2008 From 1878 to 1881, Gillet was twice elected to the Nevada City Town Trustees. He helped make the city government more effective and progressive and reportedly never missed a session. He was a trustee during construction of a new city hall. In 1890, Gillet's close friends, Jean-Baptiste and Julia Catherine Ducray both died, leaving their large orchard estate to their niece and adopted daughter Theresa Julia Brenoel (b. 1868 in Crawford County, Pennsylvania; d. Feb. 8, 1913). Gillet, 56, and Brenoel, 23, were married in 1891. The couple had no children. In 1895, Gillet was an influential voice in the creation of Nevada City's municipal water plant. In 1904-05 he was a contributing member of the American Pomological Society. After months of poor health, Gillet died from several ailments in 1908 at age 72. He was buried in the Pioneer Cemetery in Nevada City. Upon Felix Gillet's death, his wife continued to operate the nursery. She hired George Dulac as head nurseryman. They were married in 1909. In 1913, following the former Mrs. Gillet's death, the nursery was sold to Charles E. Parsons, who renamed it Felix Gillet Nursery. For another 55 years, Parsons continued to sell Gillet's nursery stock, publish a nursery catalog, and write about Gillet's pioneering horticultural work. Parsons also made new introductions of fruit and nut varieties from stock originally cultivated by Gillet. One important introduction by Parsons was the \\"Colossal\\" variety of chestnut, which had originated in another variety cultivated by Gillet.Wickson, p. 447 In 1968, the business was thought to be the oldest continuously operating nursery in California and the second-oldest west of the Rocky Mountains.\\"Nevada City Celebrates 'World Renowned' Horticulturist,\\" by Laura Brown, Grass Valley Union, January 29, 2008 Following Parsons' death in 1969, the nursery era ended and the property became a private residence. The former nursery property was later subdivided for construction of several houses. Gillet's farmhouse and some of his fruit and nut trees remain in the Aristocracy Hill neighborhood. The site still attracts admiring horticulturalists from universities in California, Oregon and Washington. In 1933, a plaque honoring Gillet was placed by Nevada City residents on a stone pillar at the entrance to the former nursery. In 1994, the University of California Walnut Breeding Program introduced, and later patented, three new walnut varieties, the most vigorous-growing of which was named \\"Felix Gillet.\\"U.S. Patent Application 20060031972 On January 27, 2008, Nevada City marked the centennial of Gillet's death by proclaiming Felix Gillet Day.

At the time, aluminium was complex to produce and more valuable than silver The American Exhibition was a world's fair held at Earls Court in West Brompton, London, in 1887 in the year of Queen Victoria's golden jubilee. Support for an exhibition had been sought in 1886, but with a loss of support and the British government insisting that an American exhibition not compete with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, the American Exhibition was deferred to 1887. The American aim of participating was to display the latest agricultural, mechanical and textile products and inventions from the United States, but the main attraction was the Wild West show featuring Buffalo Bill, part of Colorado's contribution. Other exhibitions included a showing of Albert Bierstadt's painting of the Bahama Islands: A Nor'wester in the Bahama Island. The Wild West Show The 1887 American Exhibition was the first time that William Cody's Wild West show came to London. The show itself was based on a spectacle, \\"The Drama of Civilization,\\" created by Steele MacKaye, Matt Morgan, and Nelse Waldron for the earlier American version of the Wild West show. The spectacle was a series of tableau vivants grouped into 4 \\"epochs\\": \\"The Primeval Forest,\\" \\"The Prairie,\\" \\"Cattle Ranch,\\" and \\"Mining Camp.\\" Act I, \\"The Primeval Forest,\\" ended with a fight among the Indians, and it was followed by an interlude featuring dancing by indigenous people and a demonstration of Lillian Smith's sharp-shooting.Moses, p. 34 Act II, \\"The Prairie,\\" \\"included a buffalo hunt by the Indians,\\" the passage of a train through \\"hostile land,\\" a prairie fire, and a stampede, followed by cowboy \\"riding, roping, and 'bronc busting.'\\" \\"The Attack on the Mining Camp,\\" Act or Epoch III, starred Cody defending a cabin against \\"gunfire and screaming Indians,\\" followed by Cody's and Annie Oakley's shooting. The last epoch, \\"Mining Camp,\\" featured the Pony Express, an attack on a Deadwood stagecoach, and a cyclone. Ultimately, a 5th epoch was added, \\"Custer's Last Stand,\\" at the end of which Cody entered and circled the arena on a horse, while \\"Too Late!\\" was projected onto the cyclorama. (Although the conclusion to \\"The Drama of Civilization\\" might suggest that Cody took part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he was not near enough to have arrived at the site of the battle immediately after it was over; furthermore, it is not likely that his presence would have altered the outcome of the battle.) Transporting Buffalo Bill's Wild West from New York to the UK represented an enormous undertaking, bringing to London a large number of people and animals. Performers included Oakley, 97 indigenous people, mostly people from the Sioux tribes, including Black Elk and Chief Red Shirt, as well as African-American and Mexican or Mexican-American people. The Wild West brought into the UK a large number of animals ‚Äî \\"180 horses, 18 buffalo, 10 elk, 5 Texan steers, 4 donkeys, and 2 deer\\" as well as 10 mulesMoses, p. 42 ‚Äî with customs officials suspending normal quarantine requirements in spite of a local outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease. Also on board the ship bringing the performers and animals was a real Deadwood stagecoach. Cody invited the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, to a private preview of the Wild West performance on May 5, and the Prince of Wales was impressed enough to arrange a command performance for Queen Victoria on May 11, 1887. The Queen enjoyed the show and recorded in her journal meeting Cody, Annie Oakley, Lillian Smith, Chief Red Shirt, and a number of indigenous American women and children. Black Elk recalled Queen Victoria speaking respectfully to the indigenous performers and their families later in his Black Elk Speaks, but Victoria describes them in their roles in \\"The Drama of Civilization\\" as \\"rather alarming looking, [with] cruel faces.\\" Among the dancers and a young teenager at the time, Black Elk says of Victoria that she \\"was little but fat and we liked her, because she was good to us.\\" To Queen Victoria the War Dance they danced, \\"to a wild drum & pipe, was quite fearful, with all their contortions & shrieks, & they came so close.\\" The success of this command performance for the Queen ‚Äî her first appearance at a public performance since Prince Consort Albert died in 1861Moses, p. 52 ‚Äî set the stage for another command performance on June 20, 1887, for her Golden Jubilee guests. While Victoria herself did not attend this performance, royalty from all over Europe attended, including the future Kaiser Wilhelm II and future King George V.. Queen Victoria made one more visit to the Exhibition, on June 22, 1887,Moses, p. 55 although, surprisingly, she does not refer to it in her journal for that date. However, she does mention seeing his show again at Windsor in 1892. These royal encounters provided Buffalo Bill's Wild West an endorsement and publicity that ensured its success. Buffalo Bill's Wild West closed its London run in October 1887 after over 300 performances and more than two and a half million tickets sold.Gallop, Buffalo Bill's British Wild West, p. 129.
