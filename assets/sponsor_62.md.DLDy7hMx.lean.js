In the following year, Dixon started the Bent Colliery Company which was to become the largest mining operation in the Hamilton area. In 1890 Dixon expanded his interests by acquiring the mining division of James Dunlop and Co., of Clyde Iron Works, subsequently giving up his engineering business to concentrate on his mining interests which between them were producing some 1,250,000 tons of mined coal per annum. By 1898 his Bent Colliery business having greatly increased, Dixon was able to give up his interest in the Dunlop concern to concentrate on other interests, becoming Chairman of the Broxburn Oil Company and a director of both the Edinburgh Colliery Company and the Plean Colliery, among other business concerns.  Appointments and interests  Dixon was twice elected to serve as President of the Lanarkshire Coalmasters' Association, and was to become the first President of the Coalmasters' Insurance Association, formed as a result of the requirements of the Workmen's Compensation Act.

George M. Coombs (November 27, 1851 - March 27, 1909) was an American architect from Maine. Early life Born in Brunswick, Coombs was the son of Hannah (Morse) and John Coombs, a shipbuilder. At the age of 17, George M. Coombs moved up the Androscoggin River to Lewiston, then a booming mill town, and worked as a carpenter until 1872.Peck, Bradford House NRHP Nomination. 1994. Architectural career That year, Coombs began working for Lewiston architect Charles F. Douglas. He remained with Douglas until his departure for Philadelphia in 1874. That year, he formed a partnership with Charles H. Kimball, a young architect from Portland. Due to economic instability, the two dissolved their partnership later that year, and Kimball returned to Portland. Coombs practiced alone until mid-1875, when he became the partner of William H. Stevens, another Lewiston architect. The firm of Stevens & Coombs lasted until Stevens' death in 1880. Coombs worked alone until 1896, when he established Coombs, Gibbs & Wilkinson with Eugene J. Gibbs and Harry C. Wilkinson. Wilkinson left in 1900, and Coombs and Gibbs worked together until Coombs' 1909 death. Upon his death he bequeathed his share in the firm to his son, Harry S. Coombs, who had worked for the firm since 1901. With him, Coombs & Gibbs survived until 1910.Second Callahan Block Historic Resource Inventory. 1983.

The AN/CPS-6 was developed during the later stages of World War II by the Radiation Laboratory at MIT. The first units were produced in mid-1945. General Electric developed and produced the A-model and subsequent B-model at a plant in Syracuse, New York. The unit consisted of two antennas. One of the antennas slanted at a forty-five degree angle to provide the height-finder capability. Initially, the radar was designed to detect fighter aircraft at 100 miles and 16,000 feet. The radar used five transmitters that operated at S-band frequencies ranging from 2700 to 3019 MHz. It took twenty-five people to operate the radar. An AN/CPS-6 radar was installed as part of the Lashup Radar Network at Twin Lights, New Jersey, in 1949 and proved capable of detecting targets at ranges of eighty- four miles. The first units of the follow-on 6B radar set were ready for installation by mid-1950. Fourteen 6B units were used within the first permanent network. A component designed to improve the radar's range was added in 1954. Initial tests showed the 6B unit had a range of 165 miles with an altitude limit of 45,000 feet. One radar unit and its ancillary electronic equipment had to be transported in eighty-five freight cars. The Air Force phased out the 6B model between mid-1957 and mid-1959. The AN/FPS-10 unit was essentially a stripped-down version of the AN/CPS-6B. Thirteen of these units served within the first permanent network. References * AN/CPS-6 @ radomes.org * Winkler, David F.

The Corps primary response area is the Village & Town of Lancaster, the Village of Depew and the Village & Town of Alden, New York. It also responds to areas via mutual aid agreements and requests for service. LVAC responds 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The LVAC is a combination EMS agency, having a career staff on duty 24/7 and supplemented by a volunteer staff. Lancaster Ambulance covers a population of about 90,000 people in a geographic area of approximately 83 square miles and responds to over 6,000 EMS requests a year. The Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps is dispatched by the Lancaster Police Department and receives online medical direction through the Erie County Medical Center. History The Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps was formed initially as the Lancaster Town Police Ambulance Service. Residents at the time were concerned due to delayed response times of ambulances coming from the nearby city of Buffalo, New York. Initially, the Dresser Railcar Factory in Depew donated a used 1947 Mercury ambulance to be used for the new ambulance service. On duty police officers were summoned when a rescue call came in, and they would drive to the police station to pick up the ambulance and go to the call. However, the Auxiliary police officers were invaluable to this operation as well. They would be called at home or spend time at the garage where the ambulance was quartered. Generally during daytime hours the active police would respond and at night the auxiliary police would respond to requests for the ambulance. The last surviving founding member, former Auxiliary police officer and former Director At Large Paul Welker is still active in the Corps. In those initial years, the ambulance fleet included over the years a 1955 Cadillac ambulance, a 1955 Ford Emergency Truck and a 1962 Pontiac ambulance to just name a few. In the early 1970s the Lancaster Town Police Department, no longer wishing to be in the ambulance service, allowed its members to form the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps. In 1975, the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps was incorporated as a separate entity. However, the police department & ambulance corps have an excellent working relationship till this day. The original ambulance corps was housed behind Lancaster Town Hall on Clark Street in a cramped two bay garage until 1996. Lancaster Ambulance responds with the Lancaster Police Department as well as the Depew Police Department to all EMS calls within the Village boundaries. Both the Lancaster & Depew Fire Departments only respond if requested by EMS (such as a lift assist or a motor vehicle accident). Day to day EMS calls are not handled by either village's fire departments. Within the Town of Lancaster, Lancaster Ambulance responds with the Bowmansville Volunteer Fire Association, Town Line Fire Department, Twin District Fire Company & the Millgrove Volunteer Fire Department. As of the summer of 2016, due to AMR (American Medical Response) cancelling their contracts, the Town of Alden and Village of Alden are now covered by the LVAC. LVAC is the primary ambulance service for the Town of Alden and primary ALS backup for the Village of Alden as their Fire Department operates two BLS ambulances. In late 2017, Lancaster Ambulance became the primary EMS response service to the New York State Thruway from the Transit Road (Depew) ramp to the Erie County Line eastbound. Fleet The Corps currently operates eight (8) ambulances: one (1) 2005 Braun type-3 ambulance, one (1) 2006 Braun type-3 ambulance, one(1)2009 Road Rescue type-3, one (1)2012 McCoy Miller Guardian II Type II van ambulance, (2) McCoy Miller Guardian Type II van ambulances, and (2) Ford Transit Van Ambulances 802,803,824,826, 827 culminate our frontline apparatus with 800 and 801 and 825 as our spare/reserve apparatus. Also available as a response vehicle is a 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe ALS flycar (700). 700 is also utilized as a Special Services vehicle for transport of the Emergency Bicycle Unit & SWAT Medics. A Special Operations trailer is available for transport of equipment, EBU Bicycles, and other items for Special Events. The Director of Operations has their own response vehicle, (900). This vehicle was the prior 700 flycar vehicle. Previously, the Corps did operate a BLS flycar (701) and an assistant DO vehicle (901), but were sold to streamline finances and lower worker's comp costs. Also available in the fleet are (4) Smith & Wesson Tactical Mountain Bikes. The designated ambulance numbers for the LVAC are 800,801,803,824,825,826 and 827. Ambulance Station In 1996, the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps relocated to a new, more modern and much larger ambulance station located at 40 Embry Place. This site was chosen due to it being centrally located within the vast ambulance district. The station is equipped with 5 apparatus bays which houses the 6 ambulances and 1 flycar. A living room (squad room), kitchen, dispatch center, training room, as well as offices and sleeping quarters for crews. As the station houses crews 24/7/365, the station is always manned by personnel at any given time. With an increased call volume & increasing population, the Corps is looking in the future at expansion of bays & office/ training and community space to the current headquarters. Standard Equipment Standard equipment on each ambulance includes some of the following: a Life Pak LP 15/ Zoll M Series cardiac monitor; epinephrine auto-injectors (Epi-Pen); oxygen administered via nasal cannulas; non rebreathing masks and bag valve masks; various length splints; stairchair; oral glucose; sterile gauze bandages and medical tape; blood pressure cuffs; oral suction device. Various immobilization equipment such as backboards, topdecks, KED's are on board each ambulance as well. As well ALS providers carry various medications such as Zofran, Albuterol, Nitroglycerin, Asprin, Morphine, Epinephrine etc. In addition, 700 has a RAD-57 CO detector, which is invaluable at a medical scene to rule out possible Carbon Monoxide poisoning. The RAD-57 is used to measure CO levels in a patient's bloodstream. Again, this tool is unheard of in local EMS agencies.

Dissolved and reorganized several times, it operated under various names from 1809 until its final dissolution in 1830.Violette, 172. It was created by a group of fur traders and merchants from St. Louis and Kaskaskia, Illinois, including Manuel Lisa and members of the Chouteau family.Chittenden, 137. Its expeditions explored the upper Missouri River and traded with a variety of Native American tribes, and it acted as the prototype for fur trading companies along the Missouri River until the 1820s.Wishart, 42. Creation of the company When Manuel Lisa returned to St. Louis from his first expedition to the upper Missouri River in August 1808, he reported to merchants there about the potential of the region for fur trading. On February 24, 1809, Lisa and other prominent fur traders from the St. Louis area formed an association company; its members included Benjamin Wilkinson (nephew of Louisiana Territorial Governor James Wilkinson), Jean Pierre Chouteau (son of St. Louis co-founder Ren√© Auguste Chouteau), Auguste Pierre Chouteau (son of Jean Pierre Chouteau), Reuben Lewis (brother of Meriwether Lewis), William Clark (co-captain of the Lewis and Clark Expedition), Pierre Menard, Andrew Henry, Sylvester Labadie, William Morrison, and Andrew Fitzhugh.Chittenden, 138.Benjamin Wilkinson, often listed first as partner in the company, was a trader and agent for it, bringing supplies from Louisville, Kentucky. His partner in the agency was Risdon H. Price of St. Louis. A native of Maryland, Wilkinson died in St. Louis in 1810, shortly after the company's creation. For more information, see Danisi, 241 and Holmberg, 199. The articles of association, signed on March 9, 1809, defined the roles of the company's partners: Lisa and Wilkinson were named as field traders, Clark was listed as the company agent in St. Louis, and no members were permitted to trade outside their role as members of the company.James, 250‚Äì255. The company acquired the equipment and posts of its members' private fur companies (including Fort Lisa in present-day North Dakota, where the Bighorn River emptied into the Yellowstone); the company capital resources totaled at least $40,000. Among the equipment and supplies to be traded with Native Americans for furs were guns, ammunition, and whiskey.Hebard, 46. The company defined its field of operations as the entire Missouri River valley upriver from the Platte River.Chittenden, 140. Company expeditions and reorganizations Three Forks of the Missouri, near the location of the April 12, 1810, attack on the Henry-Menard Expedition, in present-day Montana =Henry-Menard Expedition of 1809‚Äì1811= Lewis and Clark returned from their expedition, bringing with them the Mandan Indian Chief Shehaka from the Upper Missouri to visit the \\"Great Father\\" at Washington City. When Louis was appointed Governor of Missouri Territory, he sent Chief Shehaka up the Missouri with an escort of about 40 United States troops under the command of Captain Prior. On their arrival to the country of Rickarees, a warlike Indian tribe attacked the Mandans and killed eight or ten soldiers while the rest retreated with Shehaka to St. Louis. With the formation of the Missouri Fur Company, an expedition was proposed to head up the Missouri and into the Rocky Mountains during Spring of 1809. Governor Lewis contracted with the company to convey the Mandan Chief back to his tribe for the sum of $10,000. General Thomas James wrote a journal of how he enlisted in this expedition during his youth. The money was raised for trading with the Indians and trapping Beaver along the headwaters of the Missouri and Columbia rivers. The total party consisted of 350 men.James, 3-4. Pierre Menard and Andrew Henry led the first expedition of the company, leaving St. Louis about June 1809 to escort a Mandan chief back to his home and gather furs to bring back for sale in St. Louis.Chittenden, 139. The expedition comprised at least 150 men (including expert riflemen and American militia) and carried supplies for at least five new trading posts. The group built the new posts along the Missouri River in the fall of 1809. The expedition traveled as far as Fort Lisa on the Yellowstone River at the mouth of the Bighorn, where they wintered over. The next spring, the expedition returned from Fort Lisa to the Three Forks of the Missouri, where they built another trading post about two miles above the confluence of the Jefferson and Madison rivers.Chittenden, 141. As the expedition was trapping large numbers of beaver, its members expected to return to St. Louis with a substantial supply of furs that would yield a good profit. However, they had built the post at the Three Forks on Blackfeet territory without their permission, and the Blackfeet did not permit trapping on their land. Additionally, the Blackfeet disliked Lisa's having previously traded with the Crow Nation, whom they considered enemies.Wishart, 45. On April 12, 1810, a party of Blackfeet warriors attacked the traders, killing five and capturing horses, guns, ammunition, traps and furs.Chittenden, 142. They attacked the party again on April 23, 1810, at which point several traders decided to return to St. Louis with Pierre Menard, while Andrew Henry was left in command of the remaining trappers. During the return journey of the Menard group, in early May 1810, George Drouillard, formerly an interpreter for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was killed in an ambush.Chittenden, 143. At one point the trappers under Henry's command at the Three Forks post were attacked by more than 200 Blackfeet warriors, and they were forced to abandon the post in late 1810.Chittenden, 144. Henry and the trappers bivouacked across the Continental Divide at a temporary trading post on the north fork of the Snake River, now known as Henry's Fork in present-day Idaho. When hunting at the new post did not yield enough food, the trappers had to kill their horses and subsist primarily on horse flesh. In the spring of 1811, the group dissolved when some members headed south toward Spanish territory and others (such as Andrew Henry) headed east toward the Missouri River valley and St. Louis.Manuel Lisa had ascended the Missouri and the Yellowstone rivers to seek Henry and the lost group, and they met in July 1811. Chittenden, 145. The first trade and trapping expedition of the Missouri Fur Company failed to supply the company with furs and resulted in their abandonment of Fort Lisa on the Yellowstone River. =Chouteau Expedition of 1810= While the Henry-Menard Expedition had trouble in the upper Missouri region, Auguste Pierre Chouteau launched his own expedition to the Mandan.Chittenden, 145. He lost numerous furs and a trading post among the Mandan when a fire destroyed the post. The losses of the fire led Chouteau to return to St. Louis in late 1810, where low prices for beaver furs compounded the economic failure for his expedition. Manuel Lisa, co- founder and primary owner of the Missouri Fur Company after 1813 =Reorganizations of 1812 and 1813= Although the terms of the association were set to expire in March 1812, the officers dissolved and reorganized the company in January 1812; it had fewer of its original members and approximately $30,000 in valuation.Chittenden, 147. The new company operated as a joint-stock company with ten total shares, yet share ownership was restricted to St. Louis owners. The wealthy fur merchant John Jacob Astor's offer to invest in five more shares (of $3000 each) was rejected by the association members. In early 1812, the newly reorganized company sent an expedition with $11,000 of trade merchandise on two boats up the Missouri River.Chittenden, 148. This expedition, led by Manuel Lisa, returned on September 27, 1812, with few furs and little profit. The next year's expedition was unprofitable as well, and in the fall of 1813, the association was again dissolved and reorganized.Chittenden, 149. Manuel Lisa was the primary owner of the new company, with few original members and less capitalization. At this time the company began to be called the Manuel Lisa Trading Company. Because of the outbreak of the War of 1812, he undertook few operations; news of the war reached the Louisiana Territory in 1813. The war interrupted trade with the upper Missouri River tribes until 1816, and during this time the company focused its efforts at Council Bluff. It was near there that a new Fort Lisa was constructed, in what is now North Omaha, Nebraska. =Reorganization of 1819= After the war, in 1819, the company dissolved and was reorganized. Only Lisa remained from among the original members, with Joshua Pilcher, Thomas Hempstead (brother of Edward Hempstead, speaker of the territorial legislature), Joseph Perkins, Andrew Woods, Moses Carson, John B. Zenoni, Andrew Drips, and Robert Jones purchasing remaining shares. Lisa's last expedition departed in late 1819 and returned from Fort Lisa in the spring of 1820. After his return, Lisa unexpectedly died in St. Louis of an unknown illness in August 1820.Chittenden, 150.At that time, the Missouri Fur Company had capitalization of $17,000, more than twice as large as any other fur trade operation then in St. Louis. Chittenden, 151. Joshua Pilcher became the new president of the company and in 1821 tried to expand operations to the upper Missouri region. Pilcher sent an expedition to the mouth of the White River, where in the fall of 1820, the company built Fort Recovery.Wishart, 48. In late 1821 Pilcher directed the construction of Fort Benton at the mouth of the Bighorn River on the Yellowstone River, the site of the former Fort Lisa. =Jones' Expedition of 1822= In early 1822, Pilcher sent an expedition led by Robert Jones from St. Charles, Missouri to the new Fort Benton. By the end of the year, the party had brought back more than $25,000 worth of furs to St. Louis. In early 1823, the same group left Fort Benton to negotiate with the Blackfeet for trade purposes, reaching the Three Forks by May. In late May 1823, the group met a party of Blackfeet with whom they negotiated for a new post near the Great Falls of the Missouri.Chittenden, 151. Although the Blackfeet treated the Jones Expedition well, the expedition retreated back toward Fort Benton.Chittenden, 152. On May 30, 1823, the same Blackfeet attacked the expedition.Chittenden, 153. Pilcher wrote to the Indian agent at Fort Atkinson describing the attack: The surviving members of the group constructed boats to float toward Fort Vanderburgh on the Missouri River, twelve miles above the confluence with the Yellowstone River, and eventually returned to St. Louis.Chittenden, 154. Dissolution After the Jones Expedition, Pilcher dissolved the Missouri Fur Company in the fall of 1824. A new company named after Pilcher formed to take over the assets of the Missouri Fur Company, and it quickly withdrew from all former Missouri Fur Company posts above Council Bluff.Chittenden, 155. The new company's trade power was limited by the expansion of rival companies such as the American Fur Company (owned by John Jacob Astor) and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company (owned by former Missouri Fur Company shareholder Andrew Henry and William Henry Ashley). Competition was not the only problem the company faced, as its suppliers and agents became increasingly unreliable. =Pilcher Expedition of 1827‚Äì1829= South Pass in southwestern Wyoming, where the Pilcher Expedition camped in late 1827 when its horses were stolen Pilcher led the last expedition of the Pilcher Company, and they left Council Bluff in September 1827 heading toward the Salt Lake Valley via the Platte and Sweetwater River rivers.Chittenden, 156. While they were encamped in the South Pass, all of the expedition's horses were stolen; the expedition bivouacked on the Green River for the winter. During the winter camp, water destroyed all of the expedition's trade goods. In the spring of 1828, most of the men returned to Council Bluff. Pilcher and nine others, however, bought new mounts and in August 1828 explored the Pacific Northwest to reconnoiter prospective trade routes. The group wintered at Flathead Lake, but their horses were stolen in February 1829. Seven of the nine trappers resigned to return home, and Pilcher and one other attempted to reach Fort Colville on the Columbia River. Traders at Fort Colville, then owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, offered Pilcher a return to St. Louis, which he accepted.The return from Fort Colville involved considerable traveling through Canada, where Pilcher encountered several western explorers, including Prince Paul of W√ºrttemberg. Chittenden, 156‚Äì157. =Final dissolution= By the time Pilcher returned to St. Louis in June 1830, he had become familiar with the Hudson's Bay Company's extensive network of British traders in Canada, as well as the operations of the powerful American Fur Company, which by this time nearly monopolized American trade.Chittenden, 157. Pilcher refused to continue against such competition and, with company assets exhausted, he dissolved the Pilcher Company without an agreement and without purchase by another company. After the dissolution, most of its former traders worked for the American Fur Company, which had its western headquarters in St. Louis, but the peak of the fur trade had passed.Conard, 34.

His nickname came from the favoured weapon he used on his victims. Member of a family already involved in crime, Guerrero and his siblings were known as Los Cuchillos (the Knives) due to their habit of sporting those weapons. He joined the underground crime world during his teenage years as a member of the private militia of drug lord Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha, aka El Mexicano. Following the death of El Mexicano, Guerrero escaped to the department of Guaviare where he joined the paramilitary groups that were active in the region. These paramilitary groups grew in number and influence and came to be called the Bloque Centauros of the United Self- Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) under the command of Miguel Arroyave. Guerrero had ascended through the ranks and by the end of the 1990s he was the commander of the Bloque in the Guaviare department. As such, he got involved in drug trafficking and soon got involved in many violent vendettas over the control of territory and drug trafficking routes. He survived the war for the control of the department of Casanare between the Bloque Centauros and the paramilitary group of H√©ctor Germ√°n Buitrago (aka Mart√≠n Llanos), and then was blamed as the author of the death of his own boss, Miguel Arroyave by Salvatore Mancuso, who declared Guerrero a military target. Following the death of Arroyave, Guerrero became one of the leaders of the divided factions of Bloque Centauros. As the government of Alvaro Uribe started a peace process with the paramilitary organizations, Guerrero demobilized on April 6, 2006, turning a 1.024 weapons arsenal that included grenades, guns, and rifles, but since he mistrusted the process he refused to join the remaining leaders and returned to his territory where he created the Colombian Popular Revolutionary Anti-communist Army (Spanish: Ej√©rcito Revolucionario Anticomunista de Colombia ‚Äì ERPAC), and started trafficking drugs yet again. As he grew up in power, linked to other drug dealers and crime lords like Daniel Barrera Barrera, and members of some fronts of FARC, he got involved in numerous vendettas, particularly as H√©ctor Germ√°n Buitrago (aka Mart√≠n Llanos) returned to the region. He started personally assassinating former Centauros members as he accused them of treason. He also misappropriated many farms that he considered strategic for his drug trafficking routes, leaving many fatalities and forced displaced victims. He also started a war against Colombian emerald tsar V√≠ctor Carranza, and has been blamed as the main author of an attempt on Carranza's life. Death The Colombian government had started a number of operations to capture Guerrero. In December 2010, as the police received information about his presence in the area of Mapirip√°n, Meta, to celebrate Christmas they launched a strong operation that captured various close members of his group. It has been suggested that Carranza had been offering rewards for information about Guerrero's whereabouts. Guerrero managed to escape through the jungle, dragged by two bodyguards, which made the authorities assume he had been hurt. His body was discovered a couple days later tangled among shrubs in a nearby brook. It was established that he had been inebriated at the moment of the operation and it's assumed he either died of cardiac arrest as he was escaping or that he fell to the brook and drowned.Radio Netherlands Worldwide, Colombia kills paramilitary drug lord wanted in US , December 29, 2010BBC News, \\"Colombian drug lord Guerrero was 'drunk' when he died, December 30, 2010  References  Colombian drug traffickers Deaths by drowning 2010 deaths 1970 births ","title":"Pedro Oliverio Guerrero"},{"id":"30242696","text":"Professor Jacques Lafaye, (born 21 March 1930) is a French historian who, from the early 1960s has written influentially on cultural and religious Spanish and Latin American history. His most popular work is Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe written in 1974 regarding the formation of the Mexican National Consciousness and includes a prologue by Octavio Paz and is regarded as a key stone for the understanding of the contemporary Mexican culture and is regarded as one of the most comprehensive analysis of the colonial period in Mexico.  Life  Jacques Lafaye has a long trajectory in Spanish and Latin American history. His book Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe. The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness became an important reference for Mexican colonial history. First printed in Par√≠s by Gallimard Publishers (1974), then in the United States by the Chicago University Press (1976) and in Mexico by Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica (1977), has contributed to the understanding of the merging of the Spanish and Mexican Prehispanic cultures.

After attending military preparatory schools in Nagoya and Tokyo, he graduated from the 23rd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1911 and from the 30th class of the Army War College in November 1918. From April 1919, he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. In September 1923, he was appointed as military attache to Riga in Latvia, and afterwards was assigned to Germany, returning to Japan in August 1927. In August 1930, Shimizu was attached to the Guards 4th Infantry Regiment. He served as a bureaucrat at the General Staff from August 1931 to July 1933, when he was attached to Technical Research Headquarters, returning to the General Staff in August 1934. He served as Army liaison to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff from June to August 1936. Assigned command of the IJA 73rd Infantry Regiment from August 1936, he then served as Aide-de-Camp to Emperor Hirohito from August 1937 to March 1941. In March 1938, Shimizu was promoted to major general, and to lieutenant general in December 1940. In March 1941, Shimizu was assigned command of the IJA 41st Division, which was at the time a garrison force based at Tsingtao, China. IN May 1942, he returned to Japan and entered the reserves. However, in July 1942 he was reactivated to become Deputy Inspector-General of Military Training , one of the top posts within the Imperial Japanese Army. He served as chief-of-staff of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group from May 1943, and as chief-of-staff of the IJA Seventh Area Army from March 1944. This was a new field army raised under the Southern Expeditionary Army Group for the specific task of opposing landings by Allied forces in Japanese-occupied Malaya, Singapore and Borneo, Java, Sumatra and to consolidate a new defense line after the loss of the Solomon Islands, New Guinea and eastern portions of the Netherlands East Indies.* It had its headquarters at Singapore. In June 1944, Shimizu was reassigned to take command of the IJA 5th Army in Manchukuo. By the time he reached Manchukuo, much of its equipment and experienced troops had already been siphoned off to other commands in the Southeast Asia theatre of operations, and its poorly equipped and poorly trained forces were no match for the experienced battle-hardened Soviet armored divisions in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. , Shimizu became a prisoner of war after being captured by the invading Soviet forces and he was sent to Siberia until being released in December 1956 on the restoration of diplomatic relations between post-Japan Japan and the Soviet Union. He died in 1968.

The Mauds was founded in 1964 by Bill Durling, rhythm guitar. Bill knew Jimy Rogers from 1964 and convinced him to start singing lead for Bill's band. Jimy and Bill then asked Billy Winter, bass, Robert ‚ÄúFuzzy‚Äù Fuscaldo, lead guitar and Craig Baumgard, drums to join and the Mauds were born. These musicians built the Mauds unmistakable Chicago Blue-Eyed Soul Sound c.1965 to 1967. The name Mauds was a play on the 1960s British slang expression \\"mod\\", which meant modern. Bill Durling went off to college in Storm Lake, Iowa was replaced by Timmy Coniglio on rhythm guitar and brass, Craig Baumgard was replaced by Phil Weinberg on drums. Later, Denny Horan replaced Weinberg and Bill Winter was replaced by Bill Sunter. History ‚Äì band formation and early years It was Shadows frontman/vocalist Jimy Sohns who first discovered and championed The Mauds in 1966. Sohns helped get them find gigs and was instrumental in their signing with Dunwich Records distributed by Mercury Records, where in 1967 they gained fame with their debut single, a cover of the Sam & Dave hit \\"Hold On\\" penned by David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The song was recorded at the original Chess Studios in Chicago, home to blues giants Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. The Rolling Stones had recorded their second album there in 1964. The single charted locally at No. 15 on WCFL and No. 11 on WLS radio. The single might have gone higher, but a censorship controversy erupted when WLS got complaints about the lyrics, ‚ÄúReach out to me for satisfaction; on my knees for quick reaction.‚Äù A cleaned-up version was recorded for WLS but the songs momentum was slowed. A full album of material was recorded called ‚ÄúHold On‚Äù that yielded several other singles, including ‚ÄúWhen Something is Wrong with my Baby,‚Äù ‚ÄúHe Will Break Your Heart,‚Äù and ‚ÄúKnock On Wood‚Äù which became a No. 1 hit in Japan. The Mauds version of ‚ÄúMercy, Mercy, Mercy‚Äù an instrumental jazz hit by Cannonball Adderley, written by Joe Zawinul had soulful lyrics written by Curtis Mayfield (though credited to Vincent & Gail Fisher Levy)http://www.cannonball-adderley.com/lyric2.htm especially for them. Mayfield was so happy with the way they did his ‚ÄúYou Must Believe Me,‚Äù complete with Impressions-styled harmonies, that he promised to write several songs just for them. Jimy Rogers often lamented that unfortunately, their version was recorded around the same time (1967) as the Buckinghams more famous version, which had different lyrics and ended up being a No. 5 national hit. Two originals were included, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon and Move‚Äù by Rogers and Fuscaldo, and ‚ÄúYou Made Me Feel So Bad‚Äù by Horan and Fuscaldo. \\"I rehearsed the first line- up of The Mauds when Jimy was still in high school and hand-picked them to replace us (the Shadows of Knight as the house band) when we left The Cellar (the famous teen club in Arlington Heights, IL) to play other places,\\" said Jimy Sohns while remembering his friend. \\"Jimy even toured and sang (in my place) with The Shadows when I was sick.\\" Following \\"Hold On,\\" in 1968 the Mauds released the biggest single of their career, \\"Soul Drippin',\\" which featured the horn section of Walter Parazaider, Lee Loughnane, and Jim Pankow, as well as keyboardist Robert Lamm. ‚ÄúThese musicians were so inspired by the recording session that they went on to form their own group, C.T.A., later to become Chicago‚Äù Rogers said in an interview. The song charted at No. 85 on the Billboard singles chart and locally at No.16 on WCFL and No. 12 on WLS radio. With Jimy Rogers as the leader of the band throughout its lifespan, the band personnel grew and changed in 1969 when Richard Tufo joined on organ, Tim Coniglio left and Denny Spiegel was added with his ‚Äúoutasight screech trumpet‚Äù according to an old fan club newsletter. Frank Laurie also played trumpet, and trombone was added with Jim Zollers. Bill Sunter left and was replaced by Mike Schwab. The single ‚ÄúSatisfy My Hunger‚Äù featured Rogers on acoustic guitar, and the flip side, ‚ÄúBrother Chickie‚Äù was an instrumental featuring Rich Tufo‚Äôs jazzy organ. Sam Alessi was also on keyboards for a while during this period and again later in 1999 at the Cellar Reunion concert (Arlington Heights, IL). The Mauds help create the Chicago sound Unlike his Chicago contemporaries who had a more pop sound and were mostly inspired and influenced by the Beatles, Rogers cooked up a much more soulful musical stew that worked well with his raspy vocal style. Along with other 1960s‚Äì1970s rockers, Rogers was a disciple of rhythm and blues and what became known as \\"the Chicago Sound\\". While the 'British Invasion' was overtaking American rock music, the Mauds were different from other area bands, according to Bob Stroud's biography, because of the inspiration they found in soul music. \\"Lead singer Jimy Rogers possessed the beginnings of a truly legitimate set of blue-eyed soul pipes,\\" wrote Stroud. \\"Under the cover of night, these five teenage, suburban white boys were sneaking into the various South side soul emporiums to bear witness to their heroes ‚Ä¶ Sam & Dave, [Otis] Redding and [Curtis] Mayfield.\\" Rogers worked with a variety of stars including Carole King and Stephen Stills, telling friends that \\"one of the greatest honors\\" of his career \\"was being asked to sing at a memorial concert the night Otis Redding was killed\\". \\"I remember watching Jimy and The Mauds back in 1970 at the Wild Goose at an outdoors show in Oak Lawn,\\" said Jim Peterik, of Ides of March. \\"What a supreme frontman Jimy was. He was one of my role models from that moment on and \\"Soul Drippin'\\" is still one of my all‚Äìtime favorite songs.\\" Dick Biondi, broadcasting legend of WLS (AM), has continued to state ‚Äúwherever I‚Äôve gone, wherever I‚Äôve worked, one of the best recordings to ever come out of the city of Chicago is ‚ÄúSoul Drippin‚Äô by the Mauds.‚Äù It was written by Dick ‚ÄúDaddy Dewdrop‚Äù Monda, who sent Jimy an email a few months before Rogers' death, saying: ‚ÄúI just wanted to thank Jimy for his incredible readings of my songs. It changed my life and gave me the impetus to go on with my career.‚Äù In 1970, the band included Marv Jonesi on guitar, Sam Alessi on Hammond organ, Mike Schwab (Groucho) on bass, and Denny Horan on drums. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd were frequent visitors to the Mauds shows during this period, particularly in the Rush Street bars. It is rumored that the original Blues Brothers skit on Saturday Night Live was a ‚Äútake off‚Äù of the Mauds ‚ÄúWhite Soul.‚Äù The Mauds signed with RCA and recorded a single of Carole King‚Äôs ballad, ‚ÄúMan Without A Dream.‚Äù This proved to be prophetic, as the single failed to get airplay and suddenly it was Jimy Rogers who had become the man without a dream. The Mauds disbanded in 1971, after just a few years and a handful of hits together and the band changed their name to \\"Flash\\", leaving Marv Jonesi on guitar, John Christy on Hammond Organ, John Hardy on bass and Marc Coplan on drums playing around Chicago, recording a demo for Columbia records, and trying to make it in L.A. When they played the legendary Whisky a Go Go in 1971, a review written on May 1, 1971 in Billboard magazine said, ‚ÄúFlash‚Äôs set here April 13 was a model for other groups to follow‚Ä¶the final number saw something quite unusual for the Whisky. Rogers walked into the crowd like a troubadour and went from table to table, eventually got the usually staid Whisky crowd harmonizing with the band.‚Äù Al Kooper called Rogers, ‚Äúthe next Mick Jagger‚Äù and started on a project with Columbia Records that never came to fruition because of Kooper‚Äôs legal difficulties with the label over Lynyrd Skynyrd. Rogers then retired from the music business temporarily and spent a decade as a hairstylist in L.A. He cut the hair of many celebrities and it is said that he created Barry Manilow‚Äôs famous mane. Retirement and revival Returning home from California to care for his ailing mother in the 1980s, Jimy Rogers became aware of successful latter day revivals of his '60s‚Äìera peers like Shadows of Knight, The Buckinghams and The Ides of March. After his mother died in 1999, Rogers was contacted by concert organizers about reuniting the Mauds for a 1999 show celebrating the Cellar, a legendary '60s music venue in Arlington Heights. He put a band together including Denny Horan on drums, Sam Alesi on keyboards/bass, and James Scalfani on backup vocals. \\"When we played at a Cellar reunion show ‚Ä¶ it was like we were back in the 1960s again,\\" Mr. Rogers told the Chicago Tribune. \\"The crowd was going wild, and it felt so good. It made me remember what a good effect the band had on people.\\" Inspired to carry the Mauds forward into the new millennium, Rogers formed a new version in 2000 that included Al Ciner (American Breed and Rufus) on guitar, Mike Arnold on keyboards, Jerry Smith (Flock) on bass, and Bob Melville on drums. Gradually personnel were added and changed, and the new Mauds continued playing and recording, including sold-out appearances at Ravinia Festival and the Park West. The 10-piece band during this period was together approximately 8 years and featured Jimy Rogers on lead vocal, Michael Flynn on guitar, Bill LeClair on keyboards, Dave Forte on bass, Chris Drehobl on drums, Quent Lang on sax, Paul Redman on trombone, Steve O‚Äôbrien on trumpet; Veronica Stanford and Jocelyn Mallard on backup vocals. They put out a live CD, ‚ÄúSoul Attitude‚Äù in 2005 and a studio album, ‚ÄúSouldier On‚Äù that included guest performances by Howard Levy (Flecktones) on harmonica, Vanessa Davis on vocals, Pat Fleming on guitar, and Greg Rzab (Black Crowes) on bass in 2007. The Mauds have had great support throughout the media in Chicago throughout the years. Dick Biondi of WLS has been a fan since the '60s. Bob Stroud of WDRV included ‚ÄúHold On‚Äù on his Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Roots CD No. 3, and ‚ÄúSoul Drippin‚Äô‚Äù on CD #5. Bob Sirott, of Channel 11, WTTW included the Mauds as one of the major influences in Chicago rock in his PBS special, Chicago Stories. WGN radio featured an interview with Jimy Rogers in their series, ‚ÄúThe Secret History of Chicago Music‚Äù which also included an article in the Chicago Reader. Rogers was also featured in the documentary film, ‚ÄúPlayer: A Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Dream‚Äù by Greg Herriges in 2006. Final chapter In 2006, Rogers formed a blues band, Blue Road, with husband and wife team Gary Gand on guitar and Joan Gand on keyboards, Ari Mintz, and then Steve Nevets on bass, Billy Shaffer (Million Dollar Quartet) and then Joel Treadwell on drums, and Graham Nelson on harmonica. Rogers was ready to explore a more rootsy mix of blues and soul, and play in local clubs and bars where the 10 piece band couldn‚Äôt fit.

The firm was established in Canton, Ohio in 1892 and became one of the nation's biggest bridge-builders during the early 20th century. It designed and/or built many bridges that later became listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  History  The Canton Bridge Company was founded in 1892 by Canton native John R. Reed. He was born in 1862 and as a young man was trained in publishing and got a job working for Canton's first daily newspaper in 1878. In 1880 he came to work for the Wrought Iron Bridge Company in Canton where he gained enough insight in the bridge construction trade to go into business for himself in 1892. His company soon became one of the largest bridge builders in the country. Mr. Reed left the company and moved to Joplin, Missouri in 1900 to work for the rival Massillon Bridge and Structural Company which was headquartered there.  Notable bridges Notable bridges built by the firm include many that are NRHP-listed (and which then usually are still surviving). Others, not listed on the NRHP, also survive, including the Cheat Bridge, in West Virginia. There are three bridges in Christian County, Missouri that still survive near the town of Ozark, Missouri. They are known as Red Bridge, Green Bridge, and Riverside Bridge. NOTE: Riverside Bridge has been condemned a closed bridge in 2010 because of safety issues from flooding and vehicle accidents impairing the bridge's safety.

The DOC is permitted to produce red wine only, made primarily from Uva di Troia, and is one of the few wine regions in Italy where Malbec is grown and permitted in a DOC wine. The DOC covers over 60 hectares (150 acres) that are planted to Uva di Troia, Montepulciano, Sangiovese, and Malbec. Rosso Barletta is noted in history for being the spark for a jousting skirmish, now known as the Challenge of Barletta, involving thirteen local Italian knights against thirteen French knights, following an evening of drinking too much Barletta wine. According to the Italian Trade Commission, when the wine region was officially recognised it retained the name Rosso Barletta in commemoration of the historic connection between the region's wine and the event. The Challenge of Barletta Monument in the commune commemorating the Challenge of Barletta The prelude to the Challenge of Barletta occurred when the French knight Charles de Touques, Monsigneur de La Motte was having dinner at an inn in Barletta. He was served the red wine from the area, and according to reports by Prospero Colonna, grand captain of the army stationed at Barletta, La Motte overindulged in the wine and became uncivil, insulting nearby Italian knights. To defend their honour, the Italians challenged the Frenchmen to a joust, to be held on 13 February 1503. The French knights were defeated by the Italians and the French then left the area. Production zone The production zone for the Rosso Barletta DOC includes 60 ha (150 acres) around the coastal city of Barletta, north of Bari and Trani. DOC requirements The Rosso Barletta DOC is permitted only for the production of red wines. The wine is predominantly a blend, but it can be a varietal that is composed 100% of Uva di Troia. At the very least Uva di Troia must be responsible for at least 70% of the blend with Montepulciano, Sangiovese, and Malbec comprising the remainder of the blend. While the Rosso Barletta DOC is unique in allowing Malbec in its wine, the grape is limited to accounting for no more than 10% of the wine. All grapes destined for Rosso Barletta must be harvested with a yield no greater than 15 tonnes per hectare. The finished red wine is required to have a minimum alcohol level of 12%. =Invecchiato= Rosso Barletta is one of the few Italian DOCs that are permitted to include Malbec in the blends The Rosso Barletta DOC includes a special labelling (similar to Reserva) for aged wines that is called Invecchiato. Unlike Reserva or Superiore, the Invecchiato designation doesn't carry with it any requirement for increased alcohol levels (though the wines do tend to be higher than the usual 12%). Instead the designation is concerned solely with ageing. Wines produced under this designation must be aged for a minimum of two years, with at least one of those years being in oak barrels or some other wooden storage vessel. Wine styles According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, Rosso Barletta is a medium bodied, fruity wine with a ruby colour. It is usually consumed very young.

He was also a member of the inaugural New South Wales Legislative Assembly for one term from 1856 until his death. Early life Nichols was the second son of Isaac Nichols, a former convict who became a successful Sydney businessman and the first postmaster in the colony, and Rosanna Abrahams, daughter of Esther Johnston (also known as Esther Abrahams or Esther Julian). Shortly before his father's death in 1819, George Nichols was sent to England for an education and returned to Sydney early in 1823. On returning to Australia he worked as an articled clerk until he was admitted as the first native-born Australian solicitor on 1 July 1833. Nichols founded the law firm Clayton Utz in February 1833. During this period he was also a journalist and editor of William Wentworth's Australian newspaper. He was bankrupted in the financial crisis of 1842 but later returned to his legal practice. Nichols was a member of the Parramatta Regional Council, a trustee of Sydney Grammar School and a leading Freemason. Among the pupils articled to Nichols were James Martin (afterwards Premier and Chief Justice of New South Wales) and Richard Dry (afterwards Premier of Tasmania). Nichols was conceded the privilege, enjoyed by no other practitioner of his grade, of appearing professionally in both the superior and inferior courts of the colony. Political career In 1848, prior to the establishment of responsible self-government, Nichols was elected to the semi- elected unicameral Legislative Council. He represented the electorate of Northumberland Boroughs (including Morpeth, West Maitland and East Maitland) until the granting of responsible self-government in 1856. At the first election under the new constitution he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as one of the two members for Northumberland Boroughs and continued to represent the seat until his death on 12 September 1857. Throughout his parliamentary career he was a strong supporter of Wentworth and William Bland. Nichols served as the Auditor General and as the Secretary for Lands for Works; the inaugural such roles in the first responsible self-government in New South Wales. He held these positions for 81 days in the government of Stuart Donaldson. Personal life Nichols married Eliza Boggs on 23 March 1831. She died on 16 February 1835 (aged 24), and he married Susannah Eliza Barnes on 16 December 1837, who died on 12 November 1846 (aged 30). He married for a third time, this time to 18-year old Eliza Smith on 14 July 1854.Family history George died from dropsy on 12 September 1857 (aged 47) and was survived by Eliza (who died on 21 July 1863, aged 27) and by two sons.

Have Dash I Have Dash I was a classified project to develop an air-to-air missile for use by stealth aircraft.Popular Mechanics, March 1990 The concept, developed by the USAF Armament Laboratory between 1985 and 1988, was extensively studied but failed to produce any flying hardware.Parsch 2005 Have Dash II Have Dash II, initiated in 1990, was a renewed effort to develop a stealthy air-to- air missile, intended to be used by the Advanced Tactical Fighter ‚Äì the YF-22 and YF-23 ‚Äì and to replace the AIM-120 AMRAAM in service. Have Dash II was designed with a composite body, trapezoidal in shape. This was intended both to reduce the missile's radar-cross-section and to resist heat at hypersonic speeds, as the missile was intended to operate at Mach 5. The body shape also allowed flush external carriage aboard the launching aircraft, and provided aerodynamic lift, making the missile more maneuverable. The prototype Have Dash II missiles were recoverable, and utilised Rocketdyne Mk 58 solid-fueled rocket motors of the same type used by the AIM-7 Sparrow.\\"Have Dash II bank- to-turn technology may be valuable for AMRAAM.\\" Defense Daily, April 21, 1992.

The town is named after Lord Kitchener, British secretary for War from July 1914. Mining history Kitchener was the location of the Aberdare Central Colliery which was developed by Caledonian Collieries Ltd during World War I. The historic mine site has been preserved as a Heritage Park (including the poppet head structure). A number of the dwellings where originally occupied by mine management. In 1914, the mine employed 93 people; four years later it employed 287. In July 1943, a large fire caused the mine to close for 12 months. The mine was closed in November 1961. The coal holding lease is still retained by Coal and Allied Limited. In 2009, a Chinese owned mining company, Austar, was granted approval to construct a surface infrastructure site just south of Kitchener.

The season began airing mid-season to accommodate Tina Fey's pregnancy. On November 14, 2011, NBC announced that 30 Rock would return at the new time of 8:00 pm. This season was initially expected to be Alec Baldwin's last, as he had announced he would be looking to expand into other forms of media. However, in January 2012, Baldwin confirmed that he would remain for the seventh and final season of 30 Rock. Season six received positive reviews and 13 Emmy Award nominations. Synopsis The story arcs of season six include: Liz has a new relationship and emotionally matures; Jack continues to attempt to recover his wife from North Korea and find his identity at Kabletown; Kenneth moves up (and later down) the corporate ladder; and Jenna reaches a new level of fame thanks to being a judge on a reality show, and considers settling down with boyfriend Paul. Cast Tina Fey portrays Liz Lemon, the head writer of a fictitious live sketch-comedy television series TGS. The TGS cast consists of two main actors. The lead actor is the loose cannon movie star Tracy Jordan, portrayed by Tracy Morgan. His co-star is the extremely narcissistic Jenna Maroney, portrayed by Jane Krakowski. Jack McBrayer plays the na√Øve NBC page, and later janitor, Kenneth Parcell. Scott Adsit acts as the witty and wise TGS producer, Pete Hornberger.

(Episode: \\"Live from Studio 6H\\") Reception =Critical reception= Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, noted that \\"there's been a lot of discussion [...] about how much Liz has or hasn't grown since the series began, and also about whether 30 Rock is a show that needs character development ‚Äî or if, in fact, that growth would be counter- productive on such a silly, cartoonish show.\\" He opined that \\"if a comedy is as funny as 30 Rock is capable of being ‚Äî and as it's been so frequently in this late-in-life season ‚Äî I'm fine with the characters being virtually identical now to the way they were in the pilot.\\" Indrapramit Das, writing for Slant Magazine, awarded the season three stars out of four and commented that \\"there's something to be said for 30 Rock's unrepentant adherence to formula. By now, the characters' repeated bumbling through the cyclical purgatory at 30 Rockefeller Plaza has attained a certain rhythm, a comforting familiarity akin to long-running sitcoms like Friends.\\" He concluded that \\"the cast's unfailing enthusiasm points to an ensemble that's only strengthening with age\\", but commented that the talents of guest star Kristen Schaal had been \\"wasted\\". Dan Forcella, reviewing for TV Fanatic, opined that \\"television shows, especially sitcoms, normally lose some of their luster as time goes on. Whether it be that the series actually gets worse, or simply our perception of it does because the novelty has worn off, more often than not, things are not going to be the same by season six. Because of that fact, 30 Rock should be commended for how good its sixth season has been. There have been misses [...] and big hits [...] but all in all, this spring has been a solid run for the veteran sitcom.\\" Writing for Splitsider, Jesse David Fox called the series \\"the best comedy of the 2011‚Äì2012 season\\" and went on to remark \\"next season is the show's last but it's not because of an overstayed welcome. The show is as sharp as ever, as gutsy as ever, as strange as ever, as funny as ever. Guys, it's the best.\\" =Ratings= The sixth-season premiere, \\"Dance Like Nobody's Watching\\", attracted an audience of 4.5 million viewers. This demonstrated an increase from the fifth-season finale, \\"Respawn\\", which had drawn an audience of 4.2 million, but a significant decrease from the fifth-season premiere, \\"The Fabian Strategy\\", which had drawn 5.9 million. Four episodes of the sixth season demonstrated new series lows: \\"Idiots Are People Three!\\" (3.8 million), \\"Today You Are a Man\\" (3.2 million), \\"The Shower Principle\\" (3.1 million) and \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" (2.8 million). The nineteenth episode of the season, \\"Live from Studio 6H\\", was broadcast live and demonstrated a six-week high in the ratings, with an audience of 3.5 million. However, the first live show, broadcast during the previous season, had attracted an audience of 6.7 million.

He is venerated as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, and the missal of the Sarum Rite refers to him as a confessor. Life Earlier versions of the Roman Martyrology contend that he was the twin brother of Saint Medard‚Äîthat they were born on the same day, were consecrated bishop on the same day, and died on the same day. However, in 511 Gildard attended the First Council of Orl√©ans, convoked by Clovis I; only in 530 was Medard consecrated. He is commemorated in Rouen, with his supposed brother. Alban Butler adds that he \\"governed the see of Rouen with great zeal during the space of fifteen years.\\" His body was buried at St. Mary's Church in Rouen, which later was named after him. According to Butler, his body was removed during Norman incursions and moved to the Abbey of St. Medard in Soissons, where it remains. Cult Church of St Medard and St Gildard, Little Bytham That Gildard is venerated in the first place is due to the association with Medard, according to Felice Lifshitz. No cult was promoted and his relics, kept in Notre Dame (St. Mary) in suburban Rouen, languished. They were removed to the Abbey of St. Medard in Soissons precisely because of the supposed sibling connection; when the monks of St. Medard discovered this link, they argued successfully with Charles the Bald that the brothers be reunited in death. Apparently the people of Rouen were not happy to see their saint go, and made the offer that the monks of St. Medard leave them the head of Gildard, for which they would give them the head of Saint Romanus of Rouen, one of their bishops, or the entire body of Remigius of Rouen, their third archbishop.

Design and development The G.91Y was an increased-performance version of the Fiat G.91 funded by the Italian government. Based on the G.91T two-seat trainer variant, the single Bristol Orpheus turbojet engine of this aircraft was replaced by two afterburning General Electric J85 turbojets which increased thrust by 60% over the single-engined variant.[Staff author] 20 June 1968. \\"Fiat G.91Y\\" Flight International, p. 931. www.flightglobal.com. Retrieved: 30 December 2011. Structural modifications to reduce airframe weight increased performance further and an additional fuel tank occupying the space of the G.91T's rear seat provided extra range. Combat manoeuvrability was improved with the addition of automatic leading edge slats. The avionics equipment of the G.91Y was considerably upgraded with many of the American, British and Canadian systems being licence-manufactured in Italy. Flight testing of three pre- production aircraft was successful, with one aircraft reaching a maximum speed of Mach 0.98. Airframe buffeting was noted and subsequently rectified in production aircraft by raising the position of the tailplane slightly. =Production= An initial order of 55 aircraft for the Italian Air Force was completed by Fiat in March 1971, by which time the company had changed its name to Aeritalia (from 1969, when Fiat aviazione merged with Aerfer). The order was increased to 75 aircraft with 67 eventually being delivered. In fact, the development of the new G.91Y was quite long, with the first order being for about 20 pre-series examples that followed the two prototypes. The first pre-series 'Yankee' (the nickname of the new aircraft) flew in July 1968. AMI (Italian Air Force) placed orders for two batches; 35 fighters followed by another 20, later cut to 10. The last one was delivered around mid 1976, making a total of two prototypes, 20 pre-series and 45 series aircraft. No export success followed.

He was the leader of two large Portuguese slaving raids on the West African coast in 1444‚Äì46.  Background  Old Customs house of Lagos, Portugal, site of the first African slave market in Portugal Lan√ßarote de Freitas (better known simply as Lan√ßarote de Lagos) was trained as a squire and chamberlain in the household of the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator. Sometime in the 1430s or early 1440s, Lan√ßarote was appointed by Henry as almoxarife (customs- collector) of Lagos, Portugal. The naval expeditions that Henry the Navigator had been sending down the West African coast since at least the early 1430s had, during their first few years, yielded little profit. They had sailed mostly along the Sahara desert coast, with no native settlements in sight or encounters worth reporting. But in 1443, one of Henry's captains, Nuno Trist√£o, returned from an expedition with some 14 captive African natives, Sanhaja Berbers seized from small native fishing settlements he found in the Bay of Arguin. The prospect of easy and profitable slave-raiding grounds around the Arguin banks aroused the interest of numerous Portuguese merchants and adventurers. That same year (1443), the regent prince Peter of Coimbra granted his brother Henry the Navigator an exclusive monopoly on all trade south of Cape Bojador. A consortium of merchants of Lagos, sometimes referred to as the Companhia de Lagos ('Lagos Company', although it was probably little more than a temporary association of merchants, rather than an incorporated company in the proper sense), applied to Henry for a license. Possibly on account of his intimate relationship with Henry, the Lagos merchants elected Lan√ßarote as their head.  First Slave Raid (1444)  Map of the Bay of Arguin Having acquired their license, the Lagos company equipped a fleet of six ships and about thirty men that set out for the Arguin banks in the Spring of 1444. The six captains are normally recorded as:Zurara (p.60-86), Barros (p.65), Quintella (p.106), Diffie and Winius (p.80-81) * 1. Lan√ßarote de Freitas * 2. Gil Eanes * 3. Est√™v√£o Afonso * 4. Rodrigo √Ålvares * 5. Jo√£o Dias * 6. uncertain (variously given as Martim Vicente, Gil Vasques, Jo√£o Bernaldez or even Gon√ßalo de Sintra). Lan√ßarote's fleet headed straight to the southern end of the Arguin Bay, where they had been told by Nuno Trist√£o's captives that populous fishing settlements could be found. A pre-dawn raid on Nar (Nair island) yielded the first set of captives. This was followed up by raids on the larger neighboring island of Tider (Tidra island) and Cerina (Serenni peninsula). In just a few days, the Lagos fleet had taken some 235 hapless Berber natives captive. The remaining population having fled the coastal settlements and hidden in the hinterlands, there was little point remaining in the area. By August, the fleet had arrived back in Lagos with their human cargo. The spectacle of the disembarkation, partition and sale of the Arguin slaves in Lagos, in the presence of Prince Henry, mounted on his horse, is described in heart-breaking detail in Zurara's Cr√≥nica.Zurara, p.79-86 For this lucrative enterprise, Lan√ßarote was knighted by Henry on the spot (even though, according to Zurara, Henry gave away his own allotment - some 46 slaves, to which he was entitled as licenser of the expedition - among his captains and household servants).  Second Slave Raid (1445/1446)  Lan√ßarote organized a second Lagos fleet for another large slave raid in 1445 (or 1446).Cortes√£o (p.18) and Diffie and Winius (p. 84, p. 467), following Zurara, place this in 1445. Quintella (p.139), following Barros, places it in 1446. Faria e Sousa (527-28) places it in 1447. The Lagos fleet was composed of 14 ships, the captains normally given as:This list is drawn mainly from Faria e Sousa (p.527) Both Zurara (p.152) and Barros (p.85-86) explicitly mention only 1-6 in their lists, referring to the rest merely as 'other honorable persons of Lagos'. However, some names, e.g. Louren√ßo Dias and Vicente Dias, are mentioned later in their narratives. * 1. Lan√ßarote de Freitas * 2. Soeiro da Costa (alcaide of Lagos and Lan√ßarote's father-in-law) * 3. √Ålvaro de Freitas (probably a relative of Lan√ßarote) * 4. Gomes Pires (captain of the king's caravel) * 5. Rodrigo Eanes Travassos (of the household of the regent Peter of Coimbra), * 6. a knight known as Palan√ßano (aboard a fusta) * 7. Vicente Dias of Lagos * 8. Martim Vicente * 9. a captain nicknamed Pican√ßo (speculated to be Diogo Gomes) * 10. Louren√ßo Dias and, more speculatively: * 11. Diogo Gon√ßalves, * 12. Pedro Alem√£o, * 13. Gil Gon√ßalves, * 14. Leonel Gil (son of Gil Eanes). This fleet is said to have carried Gil Eanes and Est√™v√£o Afonso as passengers.Zurara (p.152). Setting out in August, 1445 (or 1446), Lan√ßarote's Lagos fleet was just one of several fleets that set out from Portugal for the Arguin banks that year. Caught by bad weather, Lan√ßarote arrived at Cape Blanc with only nine ships still together, the remaining having strayed off. He proceeded to the northern end of the Arguin banks, anchoring in at ilha das Gra√ßas (uncertain, possibly Madeleine island or Pelicans island). There, Lan√ßarote was met by one of his missing ships, Vicente Dias, who had gone on ahead to Arguin island and stumbled across a small fleet of three Lisbon ships, headed by Dinis Eanes de Gr√£, who had preceded them and devastated the remaining settlements on the northern end of the bay, taking some 100 captives. At Gr√£'s suggestion, Lan√ßarote's fleet, now thirteen strong (only Palan√ßano's fusta remained unaccounted for) attacked Arguin island again (taking 4 captives), then headed to the southern end of Arguin Bay, taking 57 captives at Tider and an additional 5 somewhere further down (possibly around Cape Timris). The element of surprise being gone and the bulk of the population having already evacuated the coast, Lan√ßarote's captives were principally Sanhaja Berber tribesmen who had decided to stay and put up a fight.Zurara (p.161-71), Barros (p.88-91), Quintella (p.140-41) Dissatisfied with the meager number of captives and realizing that Arguin Bay was too thoroughly deserted to yield up any more, Lan√ßarote decided to take his fleet south to raid the Wolof lands of Senegal, which had been discovered (but not yet raided) by Nuno Trist√£o and Dinis Dias the previous year. However, not all his ships were up for the journey, several of them running short on supplies. As a result, Lan√ßarote partitioned his fleet, taking only six or seven caravels with him, sending the remaining ships back to Lagos under the command of Soeiro da Costa (a few of which would conduct an unauthorized slave raid on the Canary islands of La Palma and Gomera on their way home). Lan√ßarote's squadron soon arrived at Barbary Point, the mouth of the Senegal River, which was as yet unexplored.Zurara (p.176, p.183ff.) He dispatched Est√™v√£o Afonso on a launch to search upriver for settlements. The exploration didn't get very far. Venturing ashore at one point along the river bank, Afonso abducted two Wolof children from a local woodsman's hut, only to be chased down and furiously beaten by their father. Having barely escaped with their lives, the launch immediately returned to the waiting caravels.Zurara (p.178-83), Barros (p.110-12), Quintella (p.144-45) After sending back yet another caravel to Lagos, Lan√ßarote proceeded with his five remaining ships around Cape Vert into Dakar Bay. The squadron landed in the island of Bezeguiche (Gor√©e island), where they found a marker left behind by √Ålvaro Fernandes, a Portuguese explorer from Madeira who had preceded them there only a few weeks earlier.Zurara (p.192), Barros (p.113), Quintella (p.145) Fernandes had attempted to take a few Wolof canoes captive, with the result that the Wolof tribesmen of the mainland were already alert and in arms against the arriving ships. Not quite realizing this, Lan√ßarote sent out Gomes Pires on a launch to the mainland to open contact with the local Wolof chieftains, but Pires's approach was prevented by a hail of arrows. His first strategy foiled, Lan√ßarote ordered the Portuguese to prepare a raid on the mainland Wolof villages 'in the style of Arguin', but this came to nought. Before being able to organize the attack, a sudden storm enveloped the area, and forced the Portuguese caravels out of Bezeguiche bay, scattering them in various directions. Lan√ßarote managed to hold two other caravels (√Ålvaro de Freitas and Vicente Dias) together with him, but lost sight of the other two. Realizing they were now too few to launch an attack on the Wolof mainland, Lan√ßarote's trio set sail back to the Arguin banks, where they anchored in at Tider and took an additional 59 captives, before returning to Lagos. The remaining two ships (Louren√ßo Dias and Gomes Pires) made their way back to Portugal by themselves (Pires making a brief stop in Cape Blanc, to buy some seal pelts and slaves from some Berber traders).Zurara (p.193-94), Barros (p.115), Quintella (p.146) Little more is heard about Lan√ßarote de Lagos. In number of captives, the 1445/6 slaving expedition had been somewhat of a disappointment (at least relative to the first 1444 expedition). The prospect for future slave raids seemed dim. The Arguin banks were devastated and it was unlikely the Berber populations would return to the coasts in significant numbers, or allow themselves to be taken by surprise. The Wolof-dominated coasts of Senegal were too strong and alert for small groups of venturing Portuguese slave-raiders. If slave raids were to have any prospect of success, the element of surprise was necessary, which now meant sailing well below Senegal to new 'hunting grounds' - lengthier expeditions which required probably more supplies and capital than what Lagos merchants were willing to front or captains willing to sail. The killing of Nuno Trist√£o and his crew the next year (1446 or 1447) probably dampened any remaining enthusiasm among Lagos merchants for renewing the slave raids.

He was a priest in the seventh century of Lurcy-le-Bourg, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nevers. His name was in the convent of St. Gildard, which has now become Espace Bernadette, operated by the a small number of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, and the final resting place of St. Bernadette Soubirous History The Bollandists have little to say on the saint‚Äîhe was a priest in the seventh century who \\"edified with his virtues the parish of Lurcy-le- Bourg.\\" Local historians agree that little is known of this saint and repeat what was written in Les Petits Bollandistes. The date of his death was 24 August, but because that day was already dedicated to Saint Bartholomew Gildard's feast day was moved to 31 August, and was celebrated on that day for three centuries, until in the Nevers area it was moved back to 24 August, according to Augustin-Joseph Crosnier, vicar-general of the Diocese of Nevers in the mid-nineteenth century. Crosnies also reports that an ancient ceremony directs that the celebration is to be accompanied with wine and warm bread rolls. Gildard's body was buried in a small church dedicated to a Saint Loup (known by the Latinised name of Saint Lupus), outside the city walls of Nevers. In the course of time, after miracles had occurred, the church came to be called after both saints, and later again the name of Lupus was forgotten. Church of St. Lupus and St. Gildard Less is known of Lupus than of Gildard, though at least some historians believe that a Lupus had lived in the area and that some miracles were performed at the church that came to bear his name, which he later shared with Gildard. In the time of Charles the Bald and Charles the Fat, it was an abbey, and in the eleventh century became a parish church; by the end of that century it was left to the monastery of Saint- Laurent-l'Abbaye. The church suffered greatly during the Hundred Years' War, and the parish became so depopulated that the church was empty; in 1784 it was closed at the request of the local population. By the mid-nineteenth century, a wine press was in operation in two of the church bays, while the grounds were overgrown with vines.

Biography Judith Lang Zaimont was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Both Zaimont and her sister, Doris Lang Kosloff, began piano lessons with their mother, Bertha Lang, who was an accomplished pianist and singer. Bertha was very active in the music profession and served as a president of the New York State Music Teachers Association. Judith began lessons at Juilliard at age 12, where she studied piano and theory from 1958-1964.\\"Zaimont\\", in International Encyclopedia of Women Composers, p. 773. These lessons included piano with Rosina Lh√©vinne and theory and duo-piano with Ann Hull. Judith and Doris had a successful performance career as duo-pianists that included appearances on Lawrence Welk's and Mitch Miller's television programs and a Carnegie Hall debut in 1963.Ramney, \\"Zaimont\\", p. 685. Judith's musical ability was observed at an early age. Family members recall her singing in her sleep when she was a child. She also had an incredible ability to play by ear and sight read.Adams, \\"All-American Appeal,\\" 39. She was drawn to the art of composing after performing Chopin. She was not fond of practicing since she did not like to play the same notes over and over. She states, \\"I like to mess around with the notes.\\"Zaimont, \\"Imaging\\", p. 167. She began her compositional attempts at age eleven and won first place from the National Federation of Music Clubs for a piece written when she was only twelve.Ramney, \\"Zaimont\\", p. 685. Education and teaching experiences As Zaimont continued her education, she received a diploma from the Long Island Institute of Music in 1966, a bachelor's degree from Queens College in 1968, and a master's degree in 1978 from Columbia University.\\"Zaimont\\", in International Encyclopedia of Women Composers, p. 773. She studied composition with Hugo Weisgall and Jack Beeson at Queens College and later studied with Otto Luening while at Columbia.Ramney, \\"Zaimont\\", p. 685. She also traveled to France through a fellowship in order to study orchestration with Andr√© Jolivet.Reel, \\"Conversations with Judith Lang Zaimont\\", p. 31. She has taught at the Peabody Conservatory of Music, Adelphi University, and the University of Minnesota.Butterworth, Dictionary, p. 509. She is currently retired. Musical style Zaimont's music reflects earlier compositional styles. Much of her music incorporates elements from Romanticism and Impressionism, as well as including 20th-century techniques. Her music is broadly tonal and emphasizes recognizable structure.Adams, \\"All- American Appeal\\", p. 42. She prides herself on the ability to have recognizable form and yet still be creative. One of Zaimont's most recognizable compositional characteristics is her use of complex rhythms and sudden meter changes. She writes that rhythm is the most important element giving cohesion to a piece. She obscures the expected arrival of the downbeat, as well as incorporates an increased pulse of the music. She also includes cross rhythms.Agay, Art of Teaching Piano, pp. 361‚Äì362. Zaimont writes that her melodies are more instrumentally inspired than vocally inspired. This instrumental emphasis includes aspects of asymmetrical lines, octave displacement, as well as a more linear approach.Agay, Art of Teaching Piano, p. 369. She includes changes of character, dance rhythms, and programmatic titles in several of her works, as her pieces often draw on elements of nature, which is an inspiration for her writing.Canfield, \\"Step by Step\\", p. 64. Zaimont describes her style as \\"highly dramatic with non-traditional but tonal underpinnings\\". As Zaimont writes, \\"My style is essentially chromatic and non-contrapuntal.\\"Zaimont, \\"The Musical Woman\\", pp. 439‚Äì440. She also places importance on texture and has a strong ability to write idiomatically for all instruments, which is a result of her strong sense of inner hearing. She was forced to rely on this when an operation for otosclerosis in 1984 left her with hearing loss in her left ear. \\"When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't hear birds. And I haven't heard them through natural hearing ever since.\\"Dunn, \\"Judith Lang Zaimont\\", p. 15. Musical influences Zaimont was influenced by several well-known composers, including Berlioz, Chopin, Scriabin, Prokofiev, Debussy, Ravel, Messiaen, Stravinsky, and Copland. Her main attraction to these composers was their characterizing use of texture, fast harmonic rhythm, and figuration.Canfield, \\"Step by Step\\", p. 64. She states, \\"I prefer textures where there's a lot of 'stuff'. And since I do write melodies, the textures need to be lucid, with surfaces worked sufficiently to characterize the materials. I've been called a Romantic Modernist, and that's pretty accurate.\\"Canfield, \\"Judith Lang Zaimont\\", p. 65. Her early influence of Gershwin and Jazz can be heard in her earlier works. She also has a love of French music, especially Debussy, as well as music with text. Although one should have composers of influence, Zaimont believes it is very important for a composer to find his or her unique voice.Reel, \\"Conversation with Judith Lang Zaimont\\", p. 31. Musical impact Judith Lang Zaimont has also done much to draw attention to the challenges of female composers. Although she persistently promotes women composers, she does not like being referred to as a woman composer. \\"I never heard the term 'adjective-composer' until 1972, when I was on Bob Sherman's radio show in New York, and he asked me what it was like to be a 'woman composer'. There was dead air on the tape right at that spot, because I'd never thought of myself as any kind of adjective composer. I have special observations about being labeled a woman composer, but I keep them to myself.\\"Reel, \\"Conversation with Judith Lang Zaimont\\", p. 31. She has also addressed the absence of women composers in the repertoire of teaching materials. She believes that students are not exposed to female composers, especially living ones, throughout their course of study. She has attempted to urge teachers to include more female composers and new music in their students' college repertoire.Strempel, \\"Woman Composer Question\\", p. 171. Zaimont has made an effort to include herself in this area and has written for several ability levelsShe has also served as the head editor of the series The Musical Woman: An International Perspective. These books were published because women composers of the past were being overlooked. Thus, another major accomplishment is her record of publications, which includes the previous series and several other articles.

The book takes place in Th·ª´a Thi√™n - Hu·∫ø Province during the First Indochina War. It follows the tales of young teenagers who volunteered for the Viet Minh, operating as recons and scouts. The novel is a major success in Vietnam, receiving many positive reviews. In 1990 it was adapted into a film.  Plot  The story is set during the first years of the First Indochina War. M·ª´ng, a 12-year-old boy, illegally enters the war-torn city of Hu·∫ø and sneaks into the then-Tr·∫ßn Cao V√¢n Regiment consisting of 30 boys around the same age as him, training to be spies and scouts. His purpose was to support the resistance, thus curing his mom, whom he deliberately ran away from in order to join the combat, from her terminal asthma. After being accepted in the military, M·ª´ng soon finds himself familiarized with fellow soldiers, notably Qu·ª≥nh, L∆∞·ª£m, T∆∞, Kim, B·ªìng. They take part in a series of battles in Hu·∫ø, crippling French lines. Despite suffering casualties, the boys don't appear to be affected by PTSD. In fact, they seem to embrace the war. M·ª´ng is later offered a trip to visit his mom on horseback. However, he didn't have the bravery to meet her, leaving the job to his comrade, who also sends her the herbs that M·ª´ng gathered at the camp to improve her condition. French reinforcements pour into Hu·∫ø, forcing the Vi·ªát Minh to withdraw and set up a base in the mountainous region of Ho√† M·ªπ (now in Phong ƒêi·ªÅn). A team consisting of Kim, L∆∞·ª£m, T∆∞ and leader ƒê·ªìng re-enters Hu·∫ø to distribute revolutionary propaganda and newspapers to Hu·∫ø citizens. Hence, French forces had to strengthen their positions in the city by putting it under martial law. The mission, nonetheless, carried on successfully until Kim encounters Tr√¨, a former Viet Minh and close friend who betrayed the revolution and joined the French forces. Tr√¨ captures Kim and has him tortured, the latter succumbed to pain and reveals the entire mission to the enemy. Thus, ƒê·ªìng was killed, L∆∞·ª£m was captured. T∆∞ managed to run back to the base. L∆∞·ª£m was imprisoned alongside Th√∫i, an innocent orphan around the same age as him who was mistaken for T∆∞. He attempted to escape prison twice, but failed, causing him to be jailed in Th·ª´a Ph·ªß - an infamous prison in Hu·∫ø. Here, he befriends fellow guerillas and captured fighters, and flung into conflict with a gang of pickpockets and thieves, lead by the infamous L√©p. All hopes of fleeing seems to be fading for L∆∞·ª£m until he is selected to work in a French post office in Hu·∫ø, thanks to his relatively good French. He plans to flee by replacing Th√∫i with a sympathetic worker. In addition, he cures L√©p from cholera and makes friend with him. In favor of that, L√©p gets rid of L∆∞·ª£m's dangerous co-worker T·ª•ng, (who had been trying to do the same to L∆∞·ª£m) and replaces him. Together, at noon break, they drug the guard, steal an M1911 and an SMG, kill Tr√¨ (who spotted them en route) and plan to return to the base. Afterwards, their fates remain unknown. Meanwhile, the resistance base in Phong ƒêi·ªÅn is still very busy. M·ª´ng, despite being quite illiterate, is very good at maps and directions, and provided a good position for the army that can see the entire H√≤a M·ªπ-on a very high tree. He takes care of Qu·ª≥nh, who still needs medical attention from his infected wound. The latter appears to be a very good composer. Other members of the squad, such as B·ªìng, also scout other parts of Hu·∫ø, raiding French strongholds and camps. Qu·ª≥nh, whose father is, ironically, a very high-ranking official of Annam, is offered the chance to return home for a better life (Qu·ª≥nh was fascinated by revolutionary songs, much to his father's anger, thus he joined the Viet Minh). Despite a very promising and lucrative deal, Qu·ª≥nh pledged his loyalty to the Viet Minh. At the exact moment that he does so, which some of his relatives are present, he suffered a stroke from his wounds, and dies. He was given a very large funeral. Kim returns to the base. He betrayed the Viet Minh and now returns as a mole, using M·ª´ng's na√Øve nature to cover up his actions of espionage. But at the end, M·ª´ng learned of Kim's activities and fights him in the jungle, while Kim was deserting. However, Kim overpowers M·ª´ng, knocks him out and brings him to the enemy. M·ª´ng was able to re-enter H√≤a M·ªπ, but is captured immediately as he has been wanted for treason. In spite of solid evidence that he was indeed abducted by Kim, his cases are denied and he is jailed. French forces gather up outside of H√≤a M·ªπ and besiege the base. After relentless fighting, the entire army had to withdraw southwards, leaving only a few men behind to hold off the enemy. Viet Minh forces intend to detonate a large land mine that could wipe out a large amount of French infantry and vehicles as they enter a pre-planned area. The boy scouts are ordered to spectate the fight from the position that M·ª´ng provided to give the signal. M·ª´ng meets his mother in the base's makeshift hospital after she had volunteered to supply the army with rations and shot by the French. She had searched for M·ª´ng around the province, only to find out in the end that her son is rumored to be an enemy spy. About to succumb to bleeding and wounds, she confesses to M·ª´ng everything that she had hidden from him: that they are actually from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, M·ª´ng was actually born out of wedlock, and his biological father had died before he was born ‚Äì the abusive, treacherous man that he calls father is just a bully to his mom. Just as she finished, she passes away, and the hospital is bombed. A devastated M·ª´ng is freed from his escort as the latter took cover when a bomb stroke nearby. Suddenly knowing what to do, M·ª´ng ignores his feelings and rushes to the watchtower. The entire crew sacrificed in a bombing. Hearing the noises from the radio above, M·ª´ng climbs up the tree and gives the decisive signal that ignited the Vietnamese land mine, destroying large quantities of French troops. In the chaos, M·ª´ng is suddenly sniped and critically wounded. As he was dying, he pleaded his commander to ‚Äústop suspecting‚Äù him, before finally collapsing. In the end, the French had to abandon their positions in H√≤a M·ªπ. The Viet Minh also withdraw this base and head for D∆∞∆°ng H√≤a (now in H∆∞∆°ng Th·ªßy). M·ª´ng is buried next to his mother on a mountain, which is named after them.  Reception, adaption  In Vietnam, the book received mostly positive reviews and is regarded as one of the best military fictions of the country, comparable to The Sorrows of War. Despite this, there has not been any foreign translations of it.

Kesavadev in 1942. The protagonist of the novel is a rickshaw-puller named Pappu. The novel is one of the best known works of Kesavadev. Dev was in the forefront among the writers who employed new norms in the content and characterization in Malayalam fiction. Odayil Ninnu came as a shocking revelation that a finest piece of literature can be produced with commonplace themes and unconventional style of prose with ordinary mortals as heroes and heroines. Apart from the fact that the appearance of rickshaw puller was a thrilling experience at that time, the author blazed a new trail in Malayalam literature. With the appearance of the novel in 1942 began the publication of a series of high quality novels in Malayalam. Film adaptations * Odayil Ninnu (Malayalam, 1965): Directed by K. S.

Parish The parish was established in 1859 or 1860 for German Catholics. The first priest to minister to the German-speaking Roman Catholic residents of Manhattanville, was the Rev. D. F. Hartmann, assigned by the archdiocese in 1859. Services were initially held in the chapel on the grounds of the Academy of the Sacred Heart.

It included a series of street demonstrations which took place in Tunisia, and led to the ousting of longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. It eventually led to a thorough democratisation of the country and to free and democratic elections. The demonstrations were caused by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms (such as freedom of speech) and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010.Tunisia suicide protester Mohammed Bouazizi dies, BBC, 5 January 2011. They led to the ousting of Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending his 23 years in power. Labor unions were an integral part of the protests. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for \\"its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011\\". The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world, in a chain reaction which became known as the Arab Spring movement. Naming In Tunisia and the wider Arab world, the protests and change in government are called the Revolution or sometimes the Sidi Bouzid Revolt, the name being derived from Sidi Bouzid, the city where the initial protests began. In the Western media, these events have been dubbed the Jasmine Revolution or Jasmine Spring, after Tunisia's national flower and in keeping with the geopolitical nomenclature of \\"color revolutions\\". The name \\"Jasmine Revolution\\" originated from American journalist Andy Carvin, but it was not widely adopted in Tunisia itself. The protests and resultant political crises have generally been called the Jasmine revolution only in the foreign media.Mona Eltahawy Tunisian philosopher Youssef Seddik deemed the term inappropriate because the violence that accompanied the event was \\"perhaps as deep as Bastille Day\\", and although the term was coined by the Tunisian journalist Zied El Hani, who first used it on his blog on 13 January and initially spread via social media such as Facebook (hence \\"Revolution Facebook\\" among the youth of Tunisia), it is not in widespread use in Tunisia itself. (Google Translate version) The debate surrounding the name and the poetic influences behind the Tunisian revolution was a popular question among Tunisian intellectuals.Tunisia's revolution of dignity and freedom cannot be color-coded The name adopted in Tunisia was the Dignity Revolution, which is a translation of the Tunisian Arabic name for the revolution, (').Amira Aleya-Sghaier, The Tunisian Revolution: The Revolution of Dignity, The Journal of the Middle East and Africa Vol. 3, Iss. 1,2012 Within Tunisia, Ben Ali's rise to power in 1987 was also known as the Jasmine Revolution. (english translation) Background President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia since 1987, mostly as a one-party state with the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD). His government was characterised by the development of Tunisia's private sector in favor of foreign investment, and the repression of political opposition. Foreign media and criticised his government, which was supported by the United States and France. As a result, the initial reactions to Ben Ali's abuses by the U.S. and France were muted, and most instances of socio-political protest in the country, when they occurred at all, rarely made major news headlines. Riots in Tunisia were rare and noteworthy, especially since the country is generally considered to be wealthy and stable as compared to other countries in the region. Protests had been repressed and kept silent by the regime, and protesters would be jailed for such actions, as with hundreds of unemployed demonstrators in Redeyef in 2008. As noted by Mohamed Bacha in his book The Revolutionary Chants of Club Africain Ultras,Mohamed BachaThe Revolutionary Chants of Club Africain Ultras Tunisian youth had found an outlet to express their anger and dissatisfaction, through the fan chants of sports association Club Africain Ultras, such as: The capital is very angry, We are solidary when we make war to the sons of --- Who oppress us, and Hey Regime, The Revolution is Imminent. At the time of the revolution, Al Jazeera English reported that Tunisian activists are among the most outspoken in its part of the world, with various messages of support being posted on Twitter and facebook for Bouazizi. An op-ed article in the same network said of the action that it was \\"suicidal protests of despair by Tunisia's youth.\\" It pointed out that the state-controlled National Solidarity Fund and the National Employment Fund had traditionally subsidised many goods and services in the country but had started to shift the \\"burden of providence from state to society\\" to be funded by the bidonvilles, or shanty towns, around the richer towns and suburbs. It also cited the \\"marginalisation of the agrarian and arid central, northern west and southern areas [that] continue[s] unabated.\\" The protests were also called an \\"uprising\\" because of \\"a lethal combination of poverty, unemployment, and political repression: three characteristics of most Arab societies.\\" It was a revolution, notes a Tunisian geographer, \\"started not by the middle class or the northern urban centers, but by marginalised social groups.\\" Mohamed Bouazizi and Sidi Bouzid Twenty-six-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi had been the sole income earner in his extended family of eight. He operated a vegetable or apple cart (the contents of the cart are disputed) for seven years in Sidi Bouzid, 300 kilometres (190 miles) south of Tunis. On 17 December 2010, a female officer confiscated his cart and produce. Bouazizi, who had had such an event happen to him before, tried to pay the 10-dinars fine (a day's wages, equivalent to US$3). It was initially reported that in response the policewoman insulted his deceased father and slapped him. This was a false story, which \\"had been disseminated and used to mobilise as much as possible against the Ben Ali regime.\\" The officer, Faida Hamdi, stated that she was not even a policewoman, but a city employee who had been tasked that morning with confiscating produce from vendors without licenses. When she tried to do so with Bouazizi, a scuffle ensued. Hamdi says she called the police who then beat Bouazizi. A humiliated Bouazizi then went to the provincial headquarters in an attempt to complain to local municipality officials and to have his produce returned. He was refused an audience. Without alerting his family, at 11:30 am and within an hour of the initial confrontation, Bouazizi returned to the headquarters, doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself on fire. Public outrage quickly grew over the incident, leading to protests. This immolation, and the subsequent heavy-handed response by the police to peaceful marchers, provoked riots the next day in Sidi Bouzid. The riots went largely unnoticed, though social media sites diseminated images of police dispersing youths who attacked shop windows and damaged cars. Bouazizi was subsequently transferred to a hospital near Tunis. In an attempt to quell the unrest, President Ben Ali visited Bouazizi in hospital on 28 December. Bouazizi died on 4 January 2011. Sociologist Asef Bayat, who visited Tunisia after the uprising and carried out field research, wrote about the mechanisation of large-scale capitalist farms in towns like Sidi Bouzid that have come \\"at the cost of smallholders' debt, dispossession, and proletarianization.\\" Tunisian geographer-cinematographer Habib Ayeb, founder of the Tunisian Observatory for Food Sovereignty and the Environment (OSAE), has questioned the model of development that was introduced in Sidi Bouzid: Protests Protesters with a sign that says \\"Ben Ali, get lost\\" in French. On 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and five major newspapers (Spain's El Pa√≠s, France's Le Monde, Germany's Der Spiegel, the United Kingdom's The Guardian, and the United States' The New York Times) simultaneously published the first 220 of 251,287 leaked documents labeled confidential. These included descriptions of corruption and repression by the Tunisian regime. It is widely believed that the information in the WikiLeaks documents contributed to the protests, which began a few weeks later. There were reports of police obstructing demonstrators and using tear gas on hundreds of young protesters in Sidi Bouzid in mid-December. The protesters had gathered outside regional government headquarters to demonstrate against the treatment of Mohamed Bouazizi. Coverage of events was limited by Tunisian media. On , extra police were present on the city's streets. On 22 December, protester Lahseen Naji, responding to \\"hunger and joblessness\\", electrocuted himself after climbing an electricity pylon. Ramzi Al-Abboudi also killed himself because of financial difficulties arising from a business debt by the country's micro-credit solidarity programme. On , Mohamed Ammari was fatally shot in the chest by police in Bouziane. Other protesters were also injured, including Chawki Belhoussine El Hadri, who died later on . Police claimed they shot the demonstrators in \\"self-defence\\". A \\"quasi-curfew\\" was then imposed on the city by police. Rapper El G√©n√©ral, whose songs had been adopted by protesters, was arrested on 24 December but released several days later after \\"an enormous public reaction\\". Violence increased, and protests reached the capital, Tunis, on where a thousand citizens expressed solidarity with residents of Sidi Bouzid and called for jobs. The rally, organised by independent trade union activists, was stopped by security forces. Protests also spread to Sousse, Sfax and Meknassy. The following day, the Tunisian Federation of Labour Unions held another rally in Gafsa which was also blocked by security forces. About 300 lawyers held a rally near the government's palace in Tunis. Protests continued again on . On 30 December, police peacefully dispersed a protest in Monastir, while using force to disrupt further demonstrations in Sbikha and Chebba. Momentum appeared to continue with the protests on and the Tunisian National Lawyers Order organised further demonstrations and public gatherings by lawyers in Tunis and other cities. Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), said that lawyers across Tunisia had been \\"savagely beaten\\". There were also unconfirmed reports of another man attempting to commit suicide in El Hamma. On 3 January 2011, protests in Thala over unemployment and a high cost of living turned violent. At a demonstration of 250 people, mostly students, police fired tear gas; one canister landed in a local mosque. In response, the protesters were reported to have set fire to tyres and attacked the RCD offices. Some of the more general protests sought changes in the government's online censorship; Tunisian authorities allegedly carried out phishing operations to take control of user passwords and check online criticism. Both state and non-state websites had been hacked. On 6 January 95% of Tunisia's 8,000 lawyers went on strike, according to the chairman of the national bar association. He said, \\"The strike carries a clear message that we do not accept unjustified attacks on lawyers. We want to strongly protest against the beating of lawyers in the past few days.\\" It was reported on the following day that teachers had also joined the strike. In response to 11 January protests, police used riot gear to disperse protesters ransacking buildings, burning tyres, setting fire to a bus and burning two cars in the Tunis working-class suburb of Ettadhamen- Mnihla. The protesters were said to have chanted \\"We are not afraid, we are not afraid, we are afraid only of God\\". Military personnel were also deployed in many cities around the country. On 12 January, a reporter from Italian broadcaster RAI stated that he and his cameraman were beaten with batons by police during a riot in Tunis's central district and that the officers then confiscated their camera. A curfew was ordered in Tunis after protests and clashes with police. Hizb ut-Tahrir organised protests after Friday prayer on 14 January to call for re-establishing the Islamic caliphate. A day later, it also organised other protests that marched to the 9 April Prison to free political prisoners. Also on 14 January, Lucas Dolega, a photojournalist for the European Pressphoto Agency, was hit in the forehead by a tear gas canister allegedly fired by the police at short range; he died two days later.Laurent, Olivier (16 January 2011) \\"UNESCO, French government call for investigation of Lucas Dolega's death [update 7]\\", British Journal of Photography Walker, David (18 January 2011) \\"Photographer dies of injuries in Tunis\\", Photo District NewsBruggmann, Matthias et al.

End of Ben Ali's rule During a national television broadcast on , President Ben Ali criticised protesters as \\"extremists and mercenaries\\" and warned of \\"firm\\" punishment. He also accused \\"certain foreign television channels\\" of spreading falsehoods and deforming the truth, and called them \\"hostile to Tunisia\\". His remarks were ignored and the protests continued. On 29 December, Ben Ali shuffled his cabinet to remove communications minister Oussama Romdhani, while also announcing changes to the trade and handicrafts, religious affairs, communication and youth portfolios. The next day he also announced the dismissal of the governors of Sidi Bouzid, Jendouba and Zaghouan. In January 2011, Ben Ali said 300,000 new jobs would be created, though he did not clarify what that meant. He described the protests as \\"the work of masked gangs\\" attacking public property and citizens in their homes, and \\"a terrorist act that cannot be overlooked\\". Ahmed Najib Chebbi, the leader of the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP), responded that despite official claims of police firing in self-defense \\"the demonstrations were non- violent and the youths were claiming their rights to jobs\\" and that \\"the funeral processions [for those killed on 9 January] turned into demonstrations, and the police fired [at] the youths who were at these [...] processions.\\" He then criticised Ben Ali's comments as the protesters were \\"claiming their civil rights, and there is no terrorist act...no religious slogans\\". He further accused Ben Ali of \\"looking for scapegoats\\" and dismissed the creation of jobs as mere promises.

Days before departing office, Ben Ali announced that he would not change the present constitution, which would require him to step down in 2014 due to his age. On 14 January, Ben Ali dissolved his government and declared a state of emergency. The official reason given was to protect Tunisians and their property. People were barred from gathering in groups of more than three, and could be arrested or shot if they tried to run away. Ben Ali called for an election within six months to defuse demonstrations aimed at forcing him out. France24 reported that the military took control of the airport and closed the country's airspace. Translation from French: Ben Ali out On the same day, Ben Ali fled the country for Malta under Libyan protection. His aircraft landed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after France rejected a request to land on its territory. Saudi Arabia cited \\"exceptional circumstances\\" for their heavily criticised decision to give him asylum, saying it was also \\"in support of the security and stability of their country\\". Saudi Arabia demanded Ben Ali remain \\"out of politics\\" as a condition for accepting him. Initial impact of Ben Ali's overthrow gendarmes Following Ben Ali's departure from the country, a state of emergency was declared. Army Commander Rashid Ammar pledged to \\"protect the revolution\\". Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi then briefly took over as acting president. On the morning of 15 January, Tunisian state TV announced that Ben Ali had officially resigned his position and Ghannouchi had handed over the presidency to parliamentary speaker Fouad Mebazaa, with Ghannouchi returning to his previous position as prime minister. This was done after the head of Tunisia's Constitutional Court, Fethi Abdennadher, declared that Ghannouchi did not have right to power, and confirmed Fouad Mebazaa as acting President under Article 57 of the constitution. Mebazaa was given 60 days to organise new elections. Mebazaa said it was in the country's best interest to form a national unity government. INTERPOL confirmed that its National Central Bureau (NCB) in Tunis had issued a global alert to find and arrest Ben Ali and six of his relatives. A commission to reform the constitution and law in general was set up under Yadh Ben Achour. There were also calls by the opposition to delay the elections, holding them in six or seven months with international supervision. A Tunisian army tank deployed in front of the Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul in Tunis Following Ben Ali's departure, violence and looting continued and the capital's main train station was torched. The national army was reported to be extensively deployed in Tunisia, including elements loyal to Ben Ali. A prison director in Mahdia freed about 1,000 inmates following a prison rebellion that left 5 people dead. Many other prisons also had jailbreaks or raids from external groups to force prisoner releases, some suspected to be aided by prison guards. Residents who were running out of necessary food supplies had armed themselves and barricaded their homes, and in some cases had formed armed neighborhood watches. Al Jazeera's correspondent said there were apparently three different armed groups: the police (numbering 250,000), security forces from the Interior Ministry, and irregular militias supportive of Ben Ali who were vying for control. Ali Seriati, head of presidential security, was arrested and accused of threatening state security by fomenting violence. Following this, gun battles took place near the Presidential Palace between the Tunisian army and elements of security organs loyal to the former regime. The Tunisian army was reportedly struggling to assert control. Gunfire continued in Tunis and Carthage as security services struggled to maintain law and order. The most immediate result of the protests was seen in increased Internet freedoms. While commentators were divided about the extent to which the Internet contributed to the ousting of Ben Ali,Luke Alnutt (2012)TANGLED WEB Tunisia: Can We Please Stop Talking About 'Twitter Revolutions'?. Retrieved 15 January 2011. Facebook remained accessible to roughly 20% of the population throughout the crisis whilst its passwords were hacked by a country-wide man-in-the- middle attack. YouTube and DailyMotion became available after Ben Ali's ouster, and the Tor anonymity network reported a surge of traffic from Tunisia. Ghannouchi government A protest by the General Labour Union Anti- RCD graffiti and vandalism The Ghannouchi administration (15 January ‚Äì 27 February 2011) was a caretaker government with the primary goal of maintaining the state and providing a legal framework for new elections. Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi announced his cabinet on 17 January 2011, three days after Ben Ali's departure. The cabinet included twelve members of the ruling RCD, the leaders of three opposition parties (Mustapha Ben Jafar from the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties [FTDL], Ahmed Brahim of the Ettajdid Movement, and Ahmed Najib Chebbi of the PDP), three representatives from the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), and representatives of civil society (including prominent blogger Slim Amamou). Three notable movements not included in the national unity government were the banned Ennahda Movement, the Tunisian Workers' Communist Party and the secular reformist Congress for the Republic. The following day, the three members of the UGTT and Ben Jafaar resigned, saying that they had \\"no confidence\\" in a government featuring members of the RCD.Chrisafis, Angelique (18 January 2011) \\"Tunisia's caretaker government in peril as four ministers quit,\\" The Guardian. Retrieved 22 January 2011David D. Kirkpatrick, \\"Protesters Say Ruling Party in Tunisia Must Dissolve,\\" Herald Tribune (21 January 2011). [. Retrieved 22 January 2011] There were daily protests that members of Ben Ali's RCD party were in the new government. Thousands of anti-RCD protesters rallied in a protests with relatively little violence. On 18 January, demonstrations were held in Tunis, Sfax, Gabes, Bizerta, Sousse and Monastir. Ghannouchi and interim president Mebazaa resigned their RCD memberships in a bid to calm protests, and Ghannouchi stated that all members of the national unity government had \\"clean hands\\". On 20 January, Zouhair M'Dhaffer, a close confidant of Ben Ali, resigned from the government. All other RCD ministers resigned from the party and the central committee of the RCD disbanded itself. The new government announced in its first sitting that all political prisoners would be freed and all banned parties would be legalised. The next day, Ghannouchi committed to resigning after holding transparent and free elections within six months. Police began to join the protests in Tunis on 23 January over salaries, and to deflect blame over political deaths attributed to them during Ben Ali's rule. Army chief Rachid Ammar declares that the armed forces are also on the side of the protesters and would \\"defend the revolution\\". On 27 January, Ghannounchi reshuffled his cabinet, with six former-RCD members departing the interim government. Only Ghannouchi and the ministers of industry and international cooperation (who had not been RCD members) remained from Ben Ali's old government. This was seen as meeting one of the protesters' demands, and the UGTT stated its support for the reorganised cabinet.Kirkpatrick, David D. (27 January 2011) Most Members of Old Cabinet in Tunisia Step Down. The New York Times New ministers included state attorney Farhat Rajhi as interior minister, retired career diplomat Ahmed Ounaies as foreign minister, and economist Elyes Jouini as minister delegate to the prime minister in charge of administrative and economic reform.Tunisian labor union backs reshuffle of interim government. People's Daily Online, 28 January 2011. Ounaies later resigned after praising a foreign politician with ties to Ben Ali. Mouldi Kefi became the new foreign minister on 21 February. By 3 February, all 24 regional governors had been replaced. Days later, the government reached an agreement with the UGTT on the nomination of new governors. The Interior Ministry replaced 34 top-level security officials who were a part of Ben Ali's security infrastructure. Mebazaa promised a national dialogue to address protester demands. Sidi Bouzid and El Kef saw violence in early February with protesters killed and a police car set on fire. A local police chief was arrested. On 7 February, the defense ministry called up soldiers discharged in the previous five years to help control unrest. The first steps were taken on a bill that would give Mebazaa emergency powers, allowing him to bypass the RCD-dominated parliament. The bill would allow Mebazaa to ratify international human-rights treaties without parliament; he had previously stated that Tunisia would accede to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the First and Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which would mean abolishing the death penalty). Reports emerged on 18 February that Ben Ali had had a stroke and was gravely ill. Plans for a general amnesty were also announced on that day. Protests flared on 19 February, with 40,000 protesters demanding a new interim government completely free of association with the old regime, and a parliamentary system of government replacing the current presidential one. As a date was announced for an election in mid-July 2011, more than 100,000 protesters demanded the removal of Ghannouchi. On 27 February, following a day of clashes in which five protesters were killed, Ghannouchi resigned. He stated that he had carried his responsibilities since Ben Ali fled, and \\"I am not ready to be the person who takes decisions that would end up causing casualties. This resignation will serve Tunisia, and the revolution and the future of Tunisia.\\" Caid Essebsi government B√©ji Ca√Ød Essebsi became prime minister, appointed by Mebazaa on the day Ghannouchi resigned. Although the cabinet was now free of RCD members, demonstrations continued as the protesters criticized the unilateral appointment of Essebsi without consultation. Ghannouchi's resignation was followed the next day by the resignations of industry minister Afif Chelbi and international co-operation minister Mohamed Nouri Jouini. There were now protests for the entire interim government to resign, with the UGTT calling for an elected constituent assembly to write a new constitution. Further resignations were reported on 1 March: minister for higher education and scientific research Ahmed Brahim, minister of local development Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, and minister of economic reform Elyes Jouini. Mebazaa announced elections to a Constituent Assembly would be held on 24 July 2011. This would likely postpone general elections to a later date. This fulfilled a central demand of protesters. In early March, the interim government announced that the secret police would be dissolved. A Tunis court announced the dissolution of the RCD and liquidation of its assets, though the party said it would appeal the decision. In mid-April, charges were announced against Ben Ali, for whom international arrest warrants were issued in January. There were 18 charges, including voluntary manslaughter and drug trafficking. His family and former ministers faced 26 further charges. The elections were further postponed and ultimately held on 23 October 2011. The election appointed members to a Constituent Assembly charged with rewriting Tunisia's Constitution. The formerly banned Islamic party Ennahda, which was legalised in March, won with 41% of the total vote. Effects =Refugees= In mid- February 2011, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian refugees landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa, causing the authorities to declare a state of emergency that would allow for federal aid to the island. Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni accused the EU of not doing enough to curb immigration and asked them to do more. He said that the \\"Tunisian system was collapsing\\" and that he would \\"ask the Tunisian Foreign Ministry for permission for our authorities to intervene to stop the flow in Tunisia\\", suggesting Italian troops would be on Tunisian soil. He called the event a \\"biblical exodus\\". The comments started a row between the two countries with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry saying it was ready to work with Italy and others but that it \\"categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any infringement of its sovereignty.\\" In response, Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said that both countries share a \\"common interest\\" to halt the immigration, while he also offered \\"logistical help in terms of police and equipment\\" and called to re-establish previously successful coastal patrols of Northern Africa. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to Sicily with the other 2,000 quarantined at a re-opened holding center. On 2 March about 350 more people arrived on the island. In response, Italy declared a humanitarian emergency. The International Organisation for Migration said that no new boats had been spotted. The EU's Catherine Ashton was on a visit to Tunisia to discuss the issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \\"not everyone who does not want to be in Tunisia can come to Europe. Rather, we need to talk to each other how we can strengthen the rule of law in Tunisia again and whether Europe can be of help.\\" =Stock market= The national stock market, the Bourse de Tunis (TUNINDEX), fell on 12 January for a three consecutive day loss of 9.3%. Following the curfew in Tunis, the market index again fell 3.8% as the cost of protecting against a sovereign default in credit default swaps rose to its highest level in almost two years. Following the resignations of Ghanoucchi and two Ben Ali-era ministers, the bourse was again suspended. =International and non-state= Nantes, France, demonstration in support of the Tunisian protests Many governments and supranational organisations expressed concerns over use of force against protesters. France, the former colonial power of Tunisia, was one of just a few states that expressed strong support for the Ben Ali government prior to its ouster, though protests were held in solidarity with Tunisia in several French cities and the French Socialist Party voiced support for the popular revolution. =Media and punditry= Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan and Algeria. The lack of coverage in the domestic state-controlled media was criticised. Writer/activist Jillian York alleged that the mainstream media, particularly in the Western world, was providing less coverage and less sympathetic coverage to the Tunisia protests relative to Iranian protests, the Green movement, and censorship in China. York alleged the \\"US government ‚Äì which intervened heavily in Iran, approving circumvention technology for export and famously asking Twitter to halt updates during a critical time period ‚Äì has not made any public overtures toward Tunisia at this time.\\" Despite criticism about the \\"sparse\\" level of coverage and \\"little interest\\" given to the demonstrations by the international media, the protests were hailed by some commentators as \\"momentous events\\" in Tunisian history. Brian Whitaker, writing in The Guardian on 28 December 2010, suggested that the protests would be enough to bring an end to Ben Ali's presidency and noted similarities with the protests that led to the end of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's reign in Romania in 1989. Steven Cook, writing for the Council of Foreign Relations, noted that a tipping point is only obvious after the fact, and pointed to the counter-example of the 2009‚Äì2010 Iranian election protests. Ben Ali's governing strategy was nevertheless regarded as being in serious trouble, and Elliot Abrams noted both that demonstrators were able for the first time to defy the security forces and that the regime had no obvious successors to Ben Ali and his family. French management of the crisis came under severe criticism, with notable silence in the mainstream media in the run-up to the crisis. Repercussion analysis Al Jazeera believed the ousting of the president meant the \\"glass ceiling of fear has been for ever shattered in Tunisia and that the police state that Ben Ali created in 1987 when he came to power in a coup seems to be disintegrating\\". It added that Ben Ali's resignation, following his statement that he had been \\"duped by his entourage\\", may not have been entirely sincere. Le Monde criticised French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Union's \\"Silence over the Tragedy\\" when the unrest broke. The Christian Science Monitor suggested that mobile telecommunications played an influential role in the \\"revolution\\". The revolt in Tunisia began speculation that the Tunisian Jasmine Revolution would lead to protests against the multiple other autocratic regimes across the Arab world. This was most famously captured in the phrase asking whether \\"Tunisia is the Arab Gda≈Ñsk?\\". The allusion refers to the Polish Solidarity movement and Gda≈Ñsk's role as the birthplace of the movement that ousted Communism in Eastern Europe. The phrase appeared in outlets such as the BBC, as well as editorials by columnists Rami Khouri and Roger Cohen. Larbi Sadiki suggested that although \\"conventional wisdom has it that 'terror' in the Arab world is monopolised by al-Qaeda in its various incarnations\\", there was also the fact that \\"regimes in countries like Tunisia and Algeria have been arming and training security apparatuses to fight Osama bin Laden [but] were [still] caught unawares by the 'bin Laden within': the terror of marginalisation for the millions of educated youth who make up a large portion of the region's population. The winds of uncertainty blowing in the Arab west ‚Äì the Maghreb ‚Äì threaten to blow eastwards towards the Levant as the marginalised issue the fatalistic scream of despair to be given freedom and bread or death.\\" A similar opinion by Lamis Ardoni carried by Al Jazeera said that the protests had \\"brought down the walls of fear, erected by repression and marginalization, thus restoring the Arab peoples' faith in their ability to demand social justice and end tyranny.\\" He also said that the protests that succeeded in toppling the leadership should serve as a \\"warning to all leaders, whether supported by international or regional powers, that they are no longer immune to popular outcries of fury\\" even though Tunisia's ostensible change \\"could still be contained or confiscated by the country's ruling elite, which is desperately clinging to power.\\" He called the protests the \\"Tunisian intifada\\" which had \\"placed the Arab world at a crossroads\\". He further added that if the change was ultimately successful in Tunisia it could \\"push the door wide open to freedom in Arab world. If it suffers a setback we shall witness unprecedented repression by rulers struggling to maintain their absolute grip on power. Either way, a system that combined a starkly unequal distribution of wealth with the denial of freedoms has collapsed.\\" Similarly, Mark LeVine noted that the events in Tunisia could spiral into the rest of the Arab world as the movement was \\"inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate.\\" He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted \\"Kefaya\\" and \\"We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;\\" and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as \\"the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution.\\" He concluded that there were two scenarios that could play out: \\"a greater democratic opening across the Arab world,\\" or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the democratic election was annulled and Algeria went into a civil war. Robert Fisk asked if this was \\"The end of the age of dictators in the Arab world?\\" and partly answered the question in saying that Arab leaders would be \\"shaking in their boots\\". He also pointed out that the \\"despot\\" Ben Ali sought refuge in the same place as the ousted Idi Amin of Uganda and that \\"the French and the Germans and the Brits, dare we mention this, always praised the dictator for being a 'friend' of civilized Europe, keeping a firm hand on all those Islamists.\\" He notably pointed at the \\"demographic explosion of youth\\" of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last. He thinks \\"this is going to be the same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia ‚Äì but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability.\\" Blake Hounshell wrote on Foreignpolicy.com that the Tunisian precedent raised the prospect of a \\"new trend. There is something horrifying and, in a way, moving about these suicide attempts. It's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy.\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-12206551 Accessed 26 December 2016 =Impact of the Internet= The use of communication technologies, and the Internet in particular, has been widely credited as a contributor to the mobilisation of protests.Kravets, David. (22 August 2013) Threat Level. Wired. Retrieved 9 September 2013. A blog associated with Wired described the intricate efforts of the Tunisian authorities to control such online media as Twitter and Facebook. Other regional regimes were also on higher alert to contain spillover effects that might have ensued. On 11 March 2011, Reporters Without Borders gave its annual award for online media freedom to the Tunisian blogging group Nawaat.org. Founded in 2004, it played an important role for rallying anti-government protesters by reporting on the protests which the national media ignored.Tunisian bloggers win online media award, AP, 11 March 2011 Regional instability In January 2011, the BBC reported: \\"Clearly the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi has resonated across the region...'There is great interest. The Egyptian people and the Egyptian public have been following the events in Tunisia with so much joy, since they can draw parallels between the Tunisian situation and their own. After the beginning of the uprising in Tunisia, similar protests took place in almost all Arab countries from Morocco to Iraq, as well as in other states, ranging from Gabon to Albania, Iran, Kazakhstan, United States, India and others. Following weeks of protests, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak resigned on 11 February. Major protests against longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi broke out on 17 February and quickly deteriorated into civil war, ultimately resulting in the downfall of the Gaddafi regime later in the year. Syria experienced a major uprising of people calling for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian uprising also deteriorated into a civil war, giving rise to the militant group, ISIS, and partly causing the current refugee crisis. In addition, Yemen, Bahrain, and Algeria have seen major protests. However, a financial analyst in Dubai suggested that \\"the spillover effect of the political turbulence to the large countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council is non-existent as there are no similar drivers.\\" Aftermath In mid-May 2013, Tunisia banned the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia from carrying out party congresses. The day after the congress was due to be carried out, clashes between security forces and party supporters in Kairouan resulted in one death amid attempts to disperse those who wanted to carry out the events.Salafist group clashes with police in Tunisia ‚Äì Africa.

This arc, the first story from that title, tells the story of Superman‚Äôs first encounter with kryptonite. Artist Tim Sale described the story's theme as \\"...Superman learning about vulnerability, and one of the ways that he had to learn it, and ultimately the most personal way, was through his relationship with Lois.\\"http://www.timsale1.com/superman/index.html With Superman: Secret Origin, it has been assumed this story arc is not in continuity anymore as of 2010. Plot From the flashbacks; Kal-El's rocket reaches the Earth, and as it does, a chunk of green rock breaks off. It is taken to a temple as a display, where five years later, its stolen by mobsters and set in their courtyard. After the mobster is killed by his own wife; she is then killed by their son, Tony Gallo, who appears to be under the influence of the rock. As time passes; Gallo grows up into a vile, contemptible person. The rock itself, narrating, makes a point that it cannot exist without \\"him.\\" In present day Metropolis, Superman fights the Royal Flush Gang on a tanker. He thinks about how the city sees him as a symbol of hope just as much as he hopes he does not screw up just as the gang causes the tanker to explode. Because Superman is not hurt, he wonders if he will ever feel pain. Later, Superman and Lois Lane share a meal on the Eiffel Tower, pointing out that he hates not spending enough time with the perfect woman. The next day, Perry White meets with Lois, Clark Kent, Jimmy Olsen; and after starting dramatic, assigns to the team their next story: the new Metropolis casino from Tony Gallo that might be an illegal front. After setting up their undercover location to set up a sting; Lois calls Gallo who decides to talk to her after realizing who she is. Gallo sets up dinner with Lois, thinking the article is of a positive nature, but because Lois has an engagement with Superman, asks to be set up for tomorrow. Clark, listening, is happy and goes on patrol that night before seeing Lois where he finds a village in danger from a volcano. He goes to subdued the volcano by going below, but Superman almost drowns in the lava, and misses the date with Lois as she is now being taken by Gallo. A scared Superman goes to see Ma and Pa Kent and after telling them the story, Pa asks Clark to come to him if it happens again as Ma can get easily scared. Gallo returns Lois home, having a great time, and just as Gallo leaves, Lois sees Superman. Lois and Superman talk at her apartment, where she reveals that she met a perfect man but because he is committed to the world, does not think a relationship could work and thus leaves him. The android member of the Royal Flush Gang meets with Lex Luthor to discuss the fight; the point of the attack was to see what could harm Superman, and Luthor gets an idea when he hears Superman caring for the people around him and tells the android and the Gang to leave Metropolis. After Superman talks to a polar bear close to the Fortress of Solitude over his problems he returns home giving a huge cake for \\"Fun Day\\" where Luthor is giving a presentation and Lois hands Superman a card from Gallo; he asks Superman to pick up a check from the first six months of profits to be sent for pediatric care. He reads that toward the audience but heads out when an explosion occurs at the Casino. Just as Gallo stands naked toward the green glow from the rock; Superman begins to fall, losing his ability to fly, into the crater made from the explosion. Luthor watches his men beat Superman up, but cannot believe what they are using is that effective. Once Gallo closes the door from the rock, Superman becomes healthy again and defeats the men, before passing out. Jimmy comes over and helps him out by taking him to Clark's (to which Clark answers, as it is a robot Superman built). Lois goes to see Jimmy at the hideout but he isn't there and finds Luthor instead, who shows her images that prove Superman can be hurt. Mr. Ogilvy, from the Daily Planet, is a double agent as he reveals to Gallo what the reporters have been doing. Lois asks Gallo about himself, and Gallo wants to tell her a \\"fantastic\\" story. Lex finds out that Gallo has a rock of alien origin inside his building just as Superman goes back to Smallville to meet with his parents. Talking to both of them in the barn; Clark tells them about what happened and thinks he can be killed. Lois calls Jimmy to come over to the Casino, as Luthor plots his invasion on Gallo's casino. As promised at \\"Fun Day\\"; Superman arrives at the Casino where Gallo meets with him with Lois and Jimmy behind him and reveals who he really is. Tony Gallo is NOT Tony Gallo at all; but a physical embodiment of Kryptonite that came to Earth the same time Superman did. Gallo wants to show Superman his origins by going inside the Kryptonite room, but its effects might kill him: Superman agrees anyway. Inside, Superman falls in pain and the rock takes an anthropomorphic form, just as Luthor arrives and insists on keeping the door opened. Just as they scan Superman and Kryptonite, Gallo awakens and snaps, screaming to kill them all. Superman and the Kryptonite are on Krypton at a time before it exploded; he sees Jor-El and Lara and sees himself as a baby. Gallo, driven mad, kills himself after thinking of Lois as his mother. Lex prepares to kill Lois and Jimmy but Jimmy threatens him instead. Just as Krypton explodes, Superman sees how he escaped and is in tears when he sees Jor-El and Lara die, completing his origin. Luthor leaves, but is happy that he got a piece of the rock, just as Superman awakens to a relieved Lois and Jimmy. Doing what the Kryptonite asked for; Superman sends the rock into the sun and recounts the story to his Ma and Pa. He then goes to see Lois, as Clark, and asks if she wants some company. She agrees and they spend the night together. Reaction Since its publication, readers have favored the story. The general response was that the story contained great moments between Lois and Superman, Superman with Ma and Pa Kent, and Tim Sale's artwork was great,http://blogcritics.org/books/article/graphic-novel-review-superman- kryptonite-by/ but felt the story was mediocre, with Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen having no place in the story, and feeling the entity within the Kryptonite was random.http://whatmarkread.blogspot.com/2010/12/superman- kryptonite-by-darwyn-cooke-and.html Supermanhomepage.com reviewed the issues of the story, and while they praised the first five, the final issue had a low score because of inconsistency with the entity that was inside the Kryptonite rock.http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/2008-post-crisis- reviews/c-review-2008.php?topic=supconfidential11 Continuity With Superman: Secret Origin by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank, it can be assumed that this storyline is not in continuity anymore, but that notion can neither be confirmed nor denied as of 2010. The reasons ranged from Superman encountering kryptonite for the first time in this story, whereas this turns out to have happened in Secret Origin; the Fortress' appearance; the appearances of Krypton; Jor-El and Lara; and the events of this story itself have all led to the speculation that this storyline has been removed from continuity entirely.

Considered a 100-year flood, it was the worst flood in recorded history on nearly every major stream and river in coastal Northern California and one of the worst to affect the Willamette River in Oregon. It also affected parts of southwest Washington, Idaho, and Nevada. In Oregon, 17 or 18 people died as a result of the disaster, and it caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. The flooding on the Willamette covered . The National Weather Service rated the flood as the fifth most destructive weather event in Oregon in the 20th century. Note: Surpassed only by the Heppner Flood of 1903, the Vanport Flood of 1948, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962, and the Tillamook Burn of 1933, 1939, 1945, and 1951. California Governor Pat Brown was quoted as saying that a flood of similar proportions could \\"happen only once in 1,000 years,\\" and it was often referred to later as the Thousand Year Flood. The flood killed 19 people, heavily damaged or completely devastated at least 10 towns, destroyed all or portions of more than 20 major highway and county bridges, carried away millions of board feet of lumber and logs from mill sites, devastated thousands of acres of agricultural land, killed 4,000 head of livestock, and caused $100 million in damage in Humboldt County, California, alone. History The freeze of December 1964 that occurred before the flood An atypical cold spell began in Oregon on December 13, 1964, that froze the soil, and it was followed by unusually heavy snow. Subsequently, an atmospheric river brought persistent, heavy, warm rain. The temperature increased by . This melted the snow, but left the soil frozen and impermeable. Some places received the equivalent of a year's rain in just a few days. Albany received of rain in December, almost double its average December rainfall of . Detroit recorded an extra of rain, and at Crater Lake, where the average normal December rainfall is , there was over of rain. As rivers and streams overflowed and the soil became saturated, mudslides occurred, roads closed, and reservoirs overflowed. Many towns were isolated. By the end of the flood, every river in Oregon was above flood stage, and more than 30 major bridges were impassable. =Late January= Heavy warm rain and melting snow caused more flooding in late January 1965, after the waters had begun to recede from the December flood. More mudslides occurred in places that had withstood the December flooding, and there were more deaths. Many streams in the northern San Joaquin Valley reached higher flows than they had in December. Effect and aftermath =Oregon= The Steel Bridge during the flood The Christmas flood of 1964 was \\"the most severe rainstorm to ever occur over central Oregon, and among the most severe over western Oregon since the late 1870s\\", according to the National Weather Service office in Portland. Some of the worst mudslides occurred in the Mount Hood Corridor, and one man died in a mud and debris avalanche near Rhododendron that destroyed 15 houses. Other deaths occurred from drowning and electrocution, and one man died when the new John Day bridge collapsed. Yamhill County was severely affected. The Highway 219 bridge between Newberg and St. Paul, and Wilsonville Road between Newberg and Wilsonville were closed, trapping hundreds of people. On the Oregon Coast, downtown Reedsport was flooded with of water, and in Coos Bay, a massive logjam contributed to severe flooding. The ports at Gold Beach and Brookings were destroyed. At Oregon City, Willamette Falls was unrecognizable as a waterfall, and the city was flooded by several feet of water. In Portland, the lower deck of the Steel Bridge was underwater and had also been hit by a log raft consisting of around 1,000 logs. The impact of the raft severely damaged the Hawthorne Bridge, closing it for a year. At above flood stage, the flooding of the Willamette River at Portland in 1964 was second only to the 1948 flood that wiped out Vanport City. At its peak, the water was at the top of Downtown Portland's seawall. The Southern Pacific (SP) rail line between Portland and San Francisco was out of service for eighteen days as crews repaired damage from landslides near the Cascade Summit; and the parallel Willamette Pass highway was blocked for several days. Salt Creek washed out of Oregon Route 58 and undermined the SP viaduct footings. Landslides covered of SP track near Oakridge, and swept away of the Noisy Creek bridge north of Crescent Lake. The Willamette River washed out of SP track between Portland and Albany. =California= Map of California showing the 34 counties declared disaster areas during the flood. The six red counties sustained more damage than the other 28 counties combined. Starting on December 21, intense downpours all across Northern California caused numerous streams to flood, many to record-breaking levels. California Governor Brown declared 34 counties in the region disaster areas. Together, Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Siskiyou, Trinity, and Sonoma counties sustained more damage than the other 28 counties combined. Twenty-six U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges were destroyed. North Coast The Eel, Smith, Klamath, Trinity, Salmon, and Mad rivers, as well as other rivers and large streams, all went well beyond flood stage and peaked nearly simultaneously around December 21 and 22, breaking previous records (notably those set in the \\"hundred year\\" flood of 1955 in most cases). Sixteen state highway bridges were destroyed in California's 1st congressional district, most of them on Highway 101, and another ten county bridges were destroyed in Humboldt County. The flood destroyed of track with multiple stream and river crossings of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad through the Eel River canyon, the region's only major railroad. Many communities of Del Norte and Humboldt counties suffered massive power outages and were left isolated (or completely cut off from the rest of the state for a period), including the region's larger populated areas around Humboldt Bay, such as Eureka and Arcata, despite the fact that those cities were located on higher ground and not in the path of raging rivers. Riverside communities like Klamath, Orleans, Myers Flat, Weott, South Fork, Shively, Pepperwood, Stafford, and Ti-Bar were completely destroyed by flood waters; some of them were never rebuilt and none regained their former status. Metropolitan, Rio Dell, and Scotia were significantly damaged. The Pacific Lumber Company sawmill at Scotia lost of logs and lumber washed downstream. Crescent City, still recovering from the tsunami created by the 1964 Alaska earthquake only nine months earlier, also suffered from the floods. Over of rain fell on the Eel River basin in a span of two days. By December 23, of water rushed down the Eel River at Scotia (still upstream from the confluence of the Van Duzen River), more than the 1955 flood, and more than the average discharge of the entire Mississippi River basin. Just under of water flowed down the South Fork Eel River alone, causing severe damage along its entire length. Every single stream gauge on the Eel River was destroyed. The flood crest at Miranda was . Signs were later placed on top of tall poles to mark the unusual height of the water. The Smith River, located in Del Norte County near the Oregon border, reached flows of at Hiouchi, easily surpassing the 1955 flood's previous record of . The town of Gasquet received of rain over an eight-day period, and Crescent City received . The Klamath River reached flows of , submerging the town of Klamath under of water. The Trinity River, one of the Klamath's largest tributaries, also flooded and wrought destruction along its length. The Trinity, however, did not break the 1955 flood's records because of the newly constructed Trinity Dam, which stored of runoff from the storm. Nonetheless, an impressive of water rushed down the river at Hoopa. Between December 20 and December 26, a staggering of water flowed into the Pacific Ocean from the combined rivers and streams on the North Coast. Central Valley and beyond In the Central Valley, the Yosemite Valley was flooded, and residents of Yuba City were evacuated. Many streams reached record flood stages, including the Feather River, Yuba River, American River, Cottonwood Creek, and Butte Creek. The flood caused the uncompleted Hell Hole Dam on the Rubicon River to fail, sending even more water downstream. In total, of the Central Valley was flooded. =Elsewhere= In southwest Washington, rising rivers threatened Centralia and Longview‚ÄìKelso and closed Interstate 5 and all railways at flooded Kalama for over a week. In Nevada, the Truckee River threatened Reno.

In reviewing volume one of the Rachmaninov Series, The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music 2010 stated \\"...This is some Rachmaninov playing! Santiago Rodriguez is the real thing. For a moment, one imagines that Rachmaninov himself is at the keyboard. Rodriguez has something of Pletnev about him: wonderful authority and immaculate technical control, tremendous electricity as well as great poetic feeling. Outstanding in every way.\\"March; Greenfield; Layton (2009) p. 836 In reviewing volume one and two of Rachmaninov, Bryce Morrison of Gramophone includes \\"Santiago Rodriguez, the Cuban-American virtuoso, is born for Rachmaninov, and I doubt whether any of the works on these two discs have often been played with such a spellbinding mix of high-born virtuosity and poetic glamour.\\" In reviewing Rachmaninov 3rd/Prokofiev 3rd, the American Record Guide includes, \\"This brilliant American virtuoso takes charge immediately and steers his way through the entire concerto with blazing conviction, tremendous technical strength, unswerving concentration and galvanic excitement ‚Äì but always under absolute control. Among current CDs of the Rachmaninov Third, this goes immediately to the top of the list.

Wesley Chapel, also known as the \\"Hopetown Church\\", is a historic church building in the unincorporated community of Hopetown, Ohio, United States. Built for a Methodist congregation, the church's earliest portion was constructed in 1834; this rectangular structure forms the core of the present building. Major changes to the building since the 1830s have included the erection of a five-sided addition on the church's northern side in 1888 and significant destruction and repairs after a 1926 lightning strike.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

Accessed 2010-12-30. the church features a distinctive pyramid-shaped roof above the 1888 addition. At one time, the church also included a tower above the entrance; the tower was the portion of the building hit by the 1926 lightning strike, and it was removed as a result. The various architectural elements combine to form a building that is distinctively in the Gothic Revival style. From its earliest years, Wesley Chapel was the center of community life in Hopetown. The community was settled during the final years of the eighteenth century; the oldest graves in the church's cemetery date from the 1790s. For decade after decade, the church was the location of social activities, such as quilting bees and fish fries. Many years passed without the church being able to obtain its own minister, so it was served by circuit-riding ministers instead. Despite the prosperity brought by the coming of the Ohio and Erie Canal in the 1830s, Hopetown remained small; Wesley Chapel was always at the heart of a small settlement. In 1979, Wesley Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its important place in local history. More than forty Ross County locations are on the Register, but Wesley Chapel is the only religious building among them.

This resulted in the popularization of the home for children that were in need of safety and structure. Due to size issues with their home, the couple were approached by the young vicar at Gloria Dei Church.

Filming took place in Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Synopsis Angel (Kilmer) gets out of prison only to get involved in the gun-running ring of his old friend, Rich (Jackson). Rich and friends raid a club, killing Ali Tyrell, another arms dealer. Later, an officer investigates and calls a meeting, but two ATF agents come in disrupting the meeting. The meeting continues, discussing a mathematics teacher buying a Smith & Wesson firearm but his house gets robbed by a gangster and later he kills someone with the same gun. He subsequently decides to sell the gun back to the same shop, without knowing that the shop owner gives the firearms to Rich and his friends. Angel meets with Rich who helped him before to move guns. Afterwards, Rich and his friends torture an arms dealer who lied to them. Rich meets a news reporter to talk about the gun business and she takes him to his house. The next day, Angel meets the officer and it's shown that he was let out of prison to be an informant for them, with a flashback scene shown his wife being killed. The reporter goes to her wealthy boss to sell advanced guns to Rich, but her boss gives a lecture saying he might be a thug selling guns and says this a family business which started off with Mexican drugs now to advanced guns but she says they could trust him. The next day they meet without knowing that Angel is against them and the police are seeing their every move. The boss introduces himself to Rich and gives his van full of guns to him. He calls one of his minions to give Rich one of the guns to examine. Rich immediately agrees to buy them and is just about to pay when the police attack. During the fight Rich gets shot. Angel rescues him, but when they are alone turns and points his gun at Rich, who realizes that Angel has been the rat all along. Angel tells him that the cocktail waitress that was killed was his wife. Rich laughs and tells Angel that he is just like him, a killer, and that everybody that Angel has killed was someone's son or husband. As Angel breaks down, Rich pulls a gun, but Angel gets the shot off first. Rich lies on the ground, telling Angel to kill him, that nobody will miss him and that he'll see him in Hell. As Angel is about to kill him, the agent shoots Angel. As time elapsed, Angel walks down a corridor with a sling on his arm, and he meets with his daughter. The agent is seen walking into his office and is questioned by reporters on how he feels about Rich's plea bargain, and on the rumors that he has stepped down. The movie ends with Rich walking to his cell in handcuffs, and he looks up through the bars as the cell is opening.

St. Mary's Abbey in Trim, County Meath, Ireland is a former house of Augustinian canons dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The abbey was situated on the north bank of the River Boyne, opposite Trim Castle, on land given to St. PatrickCallery, 438. who is often credited with founding the abbey.Cogan, 299. The abbey was a prominent pilgrimage site, famous for the healing power of its statue of the Virgin Mary, until its dissolution under Henry VIII during the Reformation.Trim, 1‚Äì2. Little remains of the abbey except for the Yellow Steeple, the ruin of the abbey bell tower named for the yellow color reflected by the stonework in the setting sun,Davenport, 543. and Talbot's Castle, an abbey building converted to a manor house. History According to tradition, St. Patrick founded the church at Trim. The church of Trim was destroyed at least twice by attacking forces in 1108 and 1127. In both attacks, residents seeking sanctuary burned when the church was set afire around them. Perhaps after the fires, the church was re founded as an Augustinian abbey in the twelfth century and dedicated to St. Mary but the abbey continued to serve as the parish church.Kelly, 28. As Papal legate, St. Malachy introduced the Arrousian form of Augustinian rule to the abbey between 1140 and 1148. The de Lacy family is associated with the abbey in the thirteenth century.Trim, 1. The church burned again in 1368. Shortly after the fire, the abbey erected a statue of the Virgin Mary that would become famous for working healing miracles. The statue achieved national renownCogan, 301. as the most celebrated shrine to Mary in Ireland and pilgrims flocked to it.The Catholic Encyclopedia, 761. In 1402, Henry IV granted protection to pilgrims to the abbey, including Irish rebels. This protection continued under Henry V,Callery, 442‚Äì443. and, in 1472, a parliament at Naas passed an act that endowed the abbey with a manor and two watermills to fund a perpetual candle to be burned at the statue, four candles during the mass of St. Mary, and a chantry. Additionally, the act confirmed a donation by Richard, Duke of York of fifty-one acres and other lands,Cogan, 300. and granted protection to the pilgrims who came to see the icon.Callery, 443. According to medieval Irish chronicles, the statue performed many healing miracles around the fifteenth century to the extent that a few have referred to Trim as the \\"Lourdes of Ireland\\".Callery, 444. Royal support soured during the religious reforms and the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. Given the statue's fame Archbishop Browne hesitated to destroy the icon.Trim, 2. Nevertheless, the Madonna did not escape the flames of iconoclasm. The statue was publicly burned in 1538.Callery, 445. According to one account, the badly charred statue survived and was held in a private, Catholic household.Callery, 446. The abbey did not live long past its relic. On 15 May 1542 agents of Henry VIII forced Geoffry Dardice, St. Mary's last abbot, to sign his own expulsion. About a month after the expulsion, the abbot received an annual pension of ¬£15. The wealth of the abbey, recorded as ¬£1,861 15s. 2d. (¬£9 million based on average earnings converted to 2008 value)Currency converter was seized by the crown and its agents.Cogan, 302. Sir Anthony St. Leger received the abbey's lands for 100 marks plus an annual rent of 3s. 4d. The Yellow Steeple is alleged to have been destroyed by Oliver Cromwell.Callery, 442. The story of the tower's destruction is based on local tradition. According to one account, the Yellow Steeple was actually used as a garrison against Cromwell's troops until the tower was destroyed. Remains The extant remains of the abbey, Talbot's Castle (left) and the Yellow Steeple (right), across the Boyne (foreground) from Trim Castle The Yellow Steeple is the most prominent remnant of the abbey even though it is a ruin. The tower is thought to have been built shortly after the 1368 fire, but there is also a suggestion that it was built under Richard, Duke of York around 1450.Callery, 440. The tower, constructed of punched and squared limestone, served as the abbey's bell tower. The tower still retains the remnant of a spiral staircase, which was built without a newel. The eastern wall rises seven storeys and the southern wall reaches five, but little to nothing remains of the other sides of the formerly square tower. The eastern wall retains two clasping corner buttresses. The walls are mostly plain with a few windows and other simple decoration. The most elaborate feature is the double-pointed belfry window underneath a flower-let formed by a tracery pattern. The south wall is partly built of rubble suggesting that it was an interior wall. There are signs that a tall pointed object, such as a funerary monument, was connected to the south wall. The abbey church most likely was connected to the tower from the south.Casey, 1516. While the Yellow Steeple is often considered the only extant remain of the abbey, some evidence suggests that Talbot's Castle, a nearby manor house, may have been the abbey's refectory. The size, shape, and internal features indicate the \\"Castle\\" may have served as a monastic building before being converted to a private residence.

She also went on to abuse her third partner Andrew Glennon. Portwood was also cast in the spin-off series Teen Mom, and appeared in each of its four seasons until its conclusion in 2012. In March 2015, Portwood, along with Maci McKinney, Catelynn Baltierra, and Farrah Abraham, returned to MTV for the fifth season of the show, renamed Teen Mom OG.

She has a brother, Shawn Edwin Portwood, Jr., a United States Army veteran, and a sister, Candace Portwood (1995‚Äì1996), who died in infancy. Portwood told the press that she had been neglected by her mother in her early teens, after her mother began having an affair. She attended Anderson High School, but dropped out after falling pregnant.MTV features former AHS student in documentary  Local News  heraldbulletin.com Portwood became pregnant by her then-boyfriend, Gary Shirley, in 2008 and, later that year, on November 12, at the age of 18, gave birth to their daughter, Leah Leann Shirley. Portwood and Shirley were engaged for a time but ultimately separated, with Shirley being granted full custody of Leah in December 2011. Shirley went onto wed Kristina Shirley (n√©e Tinch, formerly Anderson), by whom he has a daughter, Emilee Grace Shirley, and become a police officer.

Legal issues MTV aired footage of Portwood's violent behaviour towards her child's father Gary Shirley, most notably a September 2010 broadcast showing an assault in which Shirley refused to physically defend himself and was injured. The MTV crew failed to intervene in Portwood's attacks and also failed to report the crimes to the police. An investigation from the police department of Anderson, Indiana, and that city's branch of the state Child Protective Services was later launched after the authorities were alerted by concerned viewers of the footage upon its broadcast, weeks after the incidents occurred.Anderson ‚ÄòTeen Mom‚Äô being investigated for assault  Archives  heraldbulletin.com The episode showed Portwood punching, slapping, and choking Shirely,MTV \\"Teen Mom\\" Amber Portwood Jailed for Domestic Violence - CBS News she then kicked him in the back as he descended a set of stairs.https://www.heraldbulletin.com/archives/anderson-teen-mom-being- investigated-for-assault/article_f9a54114-214f-52f6-b135-3a742e41dc34.html The broadcast sparked hundreds of public complaints questioning Portwood's suitability to be a mother. Police searched Portwood's apartment, finding \\"evidence that requires further investigation,\\" but would not specify what had been found at the time; it was later revealed that Portwood had been caught with a large quantity of marijuana and crack cocaine. On November 3, 2010, it was reported that Portwood agreed to allow Indiana CPS to monitor her for up to six months in exchange for CPS's allowing her to maintain custody of Leah. On November 18, after an extensive investigation, Portwood was charged with three counts of domestic violence, two of them felonies, in connection with separate incidents of on-camera abuse of Shirley. The same day, MTV released a statement concerning the charges filed on Portwood: \\"We are cooperating with all parties and hope for a quick and fair resolution that allows everyone involved to move forward in a positive manner.\\" On June 9, 2011, Portwood pleaded guilty to two felony counts of domestic battery and was given a two- year suspended sentence and two years' probation.Teen Mom's Amber Portwood Pleads Guilty in Beatdown‚ÄîIs She Going to Jail?

She was held without bond in Madison County Jail until her January 27, 2012, hearing on both charges, at which she entered a guilty plea and the court scheduled a sentencing hearing for February 6 of that year. On February 6, 2012, Portwood was given a five-year suspended sentence with the provision that all charges would be dropped if she went to and completed rehab. In March 2012, Portwood failed to take a required drug test, violating the associated condition of her suspended sentence and putting herself in jeopardy of having the five-year suspended sentence reimposed. At the ensuing probation violation hearing, the judge in the case declined to reimpose any portion of the suspended sentence, instead requiring Amber to complete 30 days of daily drug tests. Portwood subsequently dropped out of her rehabilitation program and was charged with a third violation of her probation; in June 2012, the court reimposed Portwood's five-year sentence in its entirety. On June 13, 2012, Portwood began serving her five-year sentence, during which she was expected to attend substance abuse classes and earn her GED. On December 20, 2013, Portwood made an appearance on the talk show Dr. Phil. She said that she had been released from jail early due to good behavior and now has her GED. Portwood also said that she was high on prescription and illegal medication for most episodes of Teen Mom and that she was sober with no intent of ever using again.

It was opened on 29 April 1998, as part of the Line 1 north expansion plan. History Og√¥ Monument, made by Tatti Moreno in iron, polyethylene resin, and epoxy paint with dimensions: √ó , installed in Tucuruvi station. The project of Tucuruvi station arose in 1978, during the first update of HMD plan (originally contracted by Metro in 1968), after receiving the data from the 1977 \\"Origin-Destination\\" research. Besides the definition of the expansion directives to Tucuruvi, the construction was contracted only in 1986, not before being target by two controversies. The first of them came from the fact that the Metro chose an area in Avenida Doutor Antonio Maria Laet. In a letter to the newspaper Folha de S√£o Paulo, a resident of the region made a series of inquiries, among them that the location proposed by the Metro was of hard access for the region residents from south of the avenue, and proposed the construction of Avenida Tucuruvi. In response, the Chairman of Metro, Walter Bernardes Mory, alleged that the station in the proposed location would have a higher cost (with special ventilation equipments, escalators and elevators) and would require a great depth. The second controversy came from the attorney and candidate for federal deputy candidate by the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB), Marco Antonio Perez Alves, who published an announcement of a quarter page in Folha de S. Paulo, denouncing a supposed scheme of targeting of construction biddings (made on September 1986) to determined companies. In the case of Tucuruvi station, the construction would be targeted to the constructor CBPO. In fact, CBPO won the bidding, besides the complaint didn't evoke reactions from authorities. The construction of the station began on May 1988, with opening scheduled for 1990. However, the state was in the beginning of an economic crisis, which would take it to an intervention in Banespa and a high debt of the Metro with the Brazilian Development Bank. This way, the construction was interrupted and resumed many times, until being interrupted in mid-1994 (when the station was predicted to open) and resumed in 1996 (through a concession of the ticket offices revenues to the constructors for 15 years), with the opening in 29 April 1998.

Among them was Edirili Chola Sambhuvaraya, a vassal under Rajadhiraja Chola II and Kulotunga Chola III, who ruled the northern part of Tondaimandalam, now comprising the districts of Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore, Tiruvallur, Nellore, and Chittoor. Later during the 14th century when the Telugu Cholas, Hoysala and Pandya kingdoms went into decline, the Sambuvarayas ruled their regions independently. Two chiefs of the family namely, Venrumankonda Sambuvaraya (1322 AD) and Rajanarayana Sambuvaraya (1337 AD), issued records in their own regnal years. Origin According to historian Burton Stein, the Sambuvarayas were Vanniyar chiefs who rose to power under the imperial Cholas. The Sambhuvaraya capital was at Marudaraya Padaveedu, now known as Padavedu in Polur taluk, Tiruvannamalai district, Tamil Nadu. Padaveedu (also spelt Padavedu) is the site of the popular Sri Renukambal Temple.https://www.bbc.com/news/science- environment-45814659 Rajagambhiram fort The vassal had constructed a hill fort, Rajagambhiram, at present day Padaveedu, to watch and control the movements of the northern enemies. The fort has four gates in four directions. The northern gate was now called as Shanta gate. The other gates were damaged. While the eastern gate was in a dilapidated condition, the western gate on which was found the inscription has been completely damaged. This gate was named after Puvandai alias Cholakon, one of the soldier in the military service of Edhirili Chola Sambhuvaraya. One hero stone has been erected on the plains, north of the Shanta gate. The fort was constructed with granite with a perimeter extending to . This fort once had residences and \`pandals' for warriors who were posted for duties. Holes had been made on the rock surface in such a way as to erect round tents. One could see nine tent areas on the top of the hill. Besides, four water tanks had been created to provide drinking water. Two natural water ponds were also available in the fort. Near the big tank a mortar with one foot depth and one foot diameter was dug and used. The area also revealed clear traces of Shiva and Vinayaka temples. Stone blocks, bricks each measuring 10 inches x 7 inches, lime mortar and sand were used in the construction of the fort walls.  Decline  The Sambuvarayas lost power and went into decline with the rapid expansion of the Vijayanagar empire in the 14th century. Rajanarayana Sambuvaraya allied with the Vijayanagar ruler Harihara I against the Sultanate of Madura but was later killed by Harihara's brother Bukka Raya I who sought to bring most of South India under his rule.

The film stars Ravi Teja, Richa Gangopadhyay, and Deeksha Seth in the lead. The film, which has music scored by S. Thaman, was released on 12 January 2011. The film is \\"super hit\\" at the box office completing 50 days theatrical run in 113 centers. The film has been dubbed in Hindi as Khallas and into Tamil as Murattu Singam. Plot Rishi (Ravi Teja) is an inspector in the Intelligence Bureau. His colleagues fondly call him 'Mirapakaay'. IB chief Murthy (Nagababu) gets information that mafia don Kittu (Prakash Raj) is trying to spread his tentacles in India and is targeting Delhi first. During the course of the investigation, ACP Srinivas (Sanjay Swaroop) is killed by Shankar (Kota Srinivasa Rao), a local goon, with the help of his son Linga (Supreeth). Murthy sends Rishi to Hyderabad and gets him admitted to a college as a Hindi lecturer as part of an undercover operation. Rishi meets Vinamra (Richa Gangopadhyay) at a temple and falls in love at first sight. Incidentally, she studies in the same college and in the same class to which Rishi teaches Hindi. Their love blossoms. At this juncture, Vaishali (Deeksha Seth), Kittu's daughter, joins the same college. Grabbing the opportunity, Murthy asks Rishi to extract information about Kittu from Vaishali by flirting with her and making her fall in love. Rishi makes Vaishali fall for him and reaches Kittu after killing Shankar and Linga. He finally arrests Kittu and his gang. The film ends with Rishi convincing Vinamra to marry him.

He narrated the script of Mirapakaay in the title Romantic Rishi first to Pawan Kalyan, After listening to interval episode, Pawan Kalyan gave him a go-ahead. But that project didn't materialise due to certain reasons. It was Ravi Teja who gave Harish's birth and rebirth as a director. During the shooting time of Shock he said that he would do another film with him irrespective of the commercial outcome of Shock. Harish was feeling guilty all this while and didn't approach him. He called him and asked for a story. Then he narrated the script of Mirapakai. Richa Gangopadhyay was signed after the director of the film, Harish Shankar, had noticed her at the success party of her previous film Leader. He initially offered her the role played by Deeksha as she was an NRI, but when they met to review the script, he was convinced that she would do justice to the character of Vinambra, a traditional Brahmin girl.

The director purely depends on the energy levels of Ravi Teja and the comedy angle. Ravi Teja proves that he can hold the audience purely with his high-energy levels in action, comedy and romance scenes. He is the life and blood of the movie. You can't go wrong with a title as racy as Mirapakay.

The fruit bodies are small, with silky fibers on the surface of grayish caps and thick, widely spaced gills. Mushrooms fruit in clusters on the decaying remains of Lactarius and Russula species, particularly those in the Russula nigricans group. Found primarily in temperate zones of Europe and North America, the fungus is widespread but not common. Taxonomy Jean Baptiste Francois Pierre Bulliard first described the species as Agaricus parasiticus in 1791; it was sanctioned under that name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1822 Systema Mycologicum. Rolf Singer transferred it to Asterophora in 1951. Synonyms include Gymnopus parasiticus, published by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, Merulius parasiticus by Thomas Purton in 1821, and Nyctalis parasitica by Elias Fries in 1838. According to the nomenclatural database MycoBank, facultative synonyms (based on a different type) include the following: Agaricus umbratus described by William Withering in 1796; Agaricus pilipes described by Sowerby in 1803; and Agaricus microphyllus, described by August Carl Joseph Corda in 1840. Asterophora parasitica is commonly known as the \\"parasitic asterophora\\" or the \\"Russula parasite\\". Description The cap is initially round to convex before flattening, reaching a diameter of . The caps of young fruit bodies have a smooth surface that is covered with smooth fibrils. The cap color is white to pale grey, changing to grayish brown in maturity. The cap margin is initially rolled inward. The flesh is thin, with a whitish to brownish color; it has an unpleasant odor and a farinaceous (mealy) taste. The thick, widely spaced gills have an attached to somewhat decurrent attachment to the stem. They are whitish to grayish brown, often poorly developed, sometimes forked near the cap margin, and have edges covered with fine granules. The stipe measures long by thick. Its surface has fine white fibers on a grayish brown background. The base of the cap sometimes is finely velvety and white. Initially solid, the stipe becomes hollow in age. Asterophora parasitica produces a white spore print. The edibility of the mushrooms is unknown. Spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 5‚Äì6 by 3‚Äì4 Œºm. Chlamydospores produced by the gills are spindle- shaped to oval, usually thick-walled, and measure 12‚Äì17 by 9‚Äì10 Œºm. Life cycle Much of the life cycle of Asterophora parasitica was first elaborated in detail by German mycologist Julius Oscar Brefeld, who was able to germinate basidiospores and chlamydospores. Ecology and distribution Fruit bodies grow in groups or clusters on the decomposing mushrooms of Lactarius and Russula species, particularly those in the Russula nigricans group. It has been reported from Europe and North America. Although not uncommon in southern and central Europe, it is rare in Scandinavia, where it does not grow outside the northern limit of Quercus (oak) species, suggesting that character of the soil in which the host mushrooms grow can affect the suitability as a substrate for A. parasitica. It takes about three weeks for A. parasitica to complete its development on an agaric. The yeast Asterotremella albida has been isolated from the gill tissue of Asterophora parasitica. The yeast, which is also found on Asterophora lycoperdoides, is tremelloid, meaning it has cup- shaped parenthesomes.

In a slightly longer version, the song became a number one Billboard hit for Johnny Mercer and the Pied Pipers with Capitol Records in 1946. Dinah Shore also recorded it around that time. Lamour was between record contracts at the time of the film's release, so she did not record the song herself until years later.

The ship was sold shortly thereafter to the Norwegian America Line to run on their route between Norway and the United States. Design and Construction The vessel was laid down at Northumberland Shipbuilding Co. shipyard in Howdon and launched on 21 December 1911 (yard number 185) as Cotswold Range.. After successful completion of sea trials on 5 March 1912, during which the vessel was able to attain speed of , she was delivered on the same day to her owners, Furness, Withy & Co. Upon acceptance, the ship was assigned to the Neptune Steam Navigation Company of Sunderland to operate on Europe-USA route. The vessel was primarily intended for general cargo trade, and 9 steam winches, and large number of cargo derricks were installed to facilitate quick cargo loading and unloading process. In addition, accommodations for a large number of first and second-class passengers in steel houses on the bridge deck were built. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Cotswold Range was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 7,500. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 367 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history =In British registry= Upon delivery Cotswold Range immediately sailed to Fowey arriving there on 7 March. Upon loading China clay she left Fowey for her maiden journey on 24 March 1912 and arrived at Philadelphia on 10 April. The vessel was then chartered for one trip to the Southeast Asia and left Philadelphia on 15 May for Philippines. After a long journey the ship arrived in Manila on 12 July and from there proceeded to Iloilo on 3 August. Cotswold Range was subsequently chartered to bring sugar from Java to Australia and arrived for loading in Sourabaya on 21 August. After loading 7,000 tons of sugar the ship sailed to Australia and arrived in Adelaide on 16 September where she discharged approximately 1,200 tons of her cargo. The vessel then sailed to Melbourne where she unloaded the remaining cargo, continued to Newcastle to load 6,250 tons of coal and departed on 10 October to Sourabaya and Manila.. The steamer returned to Australia to load a cargo of wool and timber at Bunbury on 30 November, continued to Albany to take on a cargo of wool and refill her bunkers before departing for UK and Europe on 17 December and arrived at London on 12 February 1913. Upon arrival in England, Cotswold Range was chartered for New York-China trip and left Fowey on 18 March with a cargo of China clay and reached Philadelphia on 8 April. The ship left New York on 23 May, transited through the Suez Canal on 17 June, called at Sabang and finally arrived at Amoy on 25 July. From Amoy the ship sailed to Foochow and Swatow and continued for loading to Haiphong arriving there on 23 August. From Haiphong she sailed to the French ports of Havre and Rouen via Sabang and Colombo and arrived at Rouen on 26 October. Following two round-the-world trips, Cotswold Range was put on the Rotterdam-New York route. The steamer arrived in Rotterdam on 14 November, loaded her cargo, including 18,253 bags of potatoes, and departed for North America on 22 November, reaching New York City on 10 December. From New York the vessel proceeded to New Orleans for cargo loading and arrived in port on 23 December. Upon loading her cargo, including 18,453 sacks of linseed cake and lumber, Cotswold Range left for Rotterdam via Port Arthur and reached it on 30 January 1914. For her next journey the ship sailed from Rotterdam on 11 February arriving at Boston on 5 March. The ship encountered some rough weather on her way, coming into port five days late, and in addition, one sailor was killed and six other injured on 26 February, when a giant wave swept over the vessel during gale knocking the man down and breaking his neck. The ship took on board 56,264 bushels of wheat and sailed for Philadelphia on 10 March. She departed Philadelphia on 16 March and safely reached Rotterdam on 1 April. Subsequently, the ship was moved to UK-US-Montreal-UK route, with the ship carrying China clay to the US ports, and returning to England from Montreal with general cargo and wheat. During her first trip on the new route, Cotswold Range brought 5,270 tons of China clay to Boston from Fowey on 9 May and subsequently sailed to Montreal in ballast arriving there on 23 May. The ship sailed from Montreal on 27 May with general cargo bound for Hull. On the next trip the vessel arrived in New York on 24 July, however, four days later Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia starting World War I which made sailing more dangerous. Cotswold Range arrived at Montreal on 13 August and after loading cargo of wheat left on 27 August for Hull. The steamer made one more trip from England to North America before the end of the year. On 13 October 1914 it was announced that the Den Norske Amerikalinje acquired two cargo passenger steamers, Cotswold Range and Chiltern Range and renamed them Trondhjemsfjord and Drammensfjord respectively. The company intended to put the vessels on their New York route to reduce expenses associated with chartering of extra tonnage. Cotswold Range was officially transferred to the Den Norske Amerikalinje on the Christmas Eve 1914 and renamed Trondhjemsfjord. =In Norwegian registry= Upon transfer, Trondhjemsfjord left Hull on 24 December 1914 and arrived at New York on 20 January 1915. She left New York on her return journey on 27 January carrying general cargo such as butter, flour, leather, coffee etc., and had to stop at Kirkwall for inspection by British authorities before arriving at Trondheim on 25 February. The ship continued serving New York to Norway route for the remainder of her career. =Sinking= Trondhjemsfjord left for her last trip from Bergen in ballast on 16 June 1915. Originally, the ship was supposed to call at Baltimore first to load wheat, but the plans had changed and a different ship, Drammensfjord, went to Baltimore instead. Trondhjemsfjord sailed directly to New York and arrived there on 5 July. After loading her usual cargo of foodstuffs and coal, the steamer departed for her return trip on 13 July. The ship was under command of captain Bang and had a crew of 33 men and had 4 passengers on board. At 02:40 on 27 July 1915 in an approximate position the ship was stopped by the British auxiliary cruiser for inspection. The captain showed the papers including a letter issued by the British consulate in New York certifying that the ship carried no contraband. Nevertheless, the steamer was boarded by a British naval officer and 5 marines and was ordered to proceed for inspection to Kirkwall. At 0:53 on 28 July Trondhjemsfjord passed by Sumba and continued sailing southeast. At around 12:25 a shot was fired across the bow of the vessel, and soon after a submarine was noticed on a starboard side of the ship. Trondhjemsfjord changed course and came to a stop at 12:50 when the submarine caught up with the vessel and came by her side. Captain Bang went on board the submarine and presented all the papers, including the Bill of Sale showing the vessel passed into Norwegian registry on 23 December 1914. The submarine's commander informed captain Bang that according to his instructions, any ship that switched registry at least 30 days prior to the outbreak of the war have to be considered as belonging to the nation she was acquired from. Since Trondhjemsfjord used to be a British vessel, she was considered an enemy and had to be destroyed. The crew lowered lifeboats from the ship, and abandoned her in orderly fashion at 13:30. Ten minutes later the submarine fired a single torpedo at the vessel hitting her amidships. Trondhjemsfjord sunk at 14:51 in an approximate position . The submarine took the boats in tow until she encountered Norwegian barque Glance. Trondhjemsfjord's crew was transferred onto barque who took course to the Scottish coast, and the submarine submerged and left the area. On 29 July about 10:00 Swedish steamer Orlando was spotted and the crew boarded her and was taken safely to Helsingborg. It was later discovered that the German submarine was responsible for the sinking.

It was a public limited company formed in 2000, owned jointly by HM Treasury and the private sector. It ceased activity in 2011. Origins In July 1997 a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) taskforce was established within the Treasury to provide central co-ordination for the roll-out of PFI. Known as the Treasury Taskforce (TTF), its main responsibilities were to standardise the procurement process and train staff throughout government in the ways of PFI, especially in the private finance units of other government departments. The TTF initially consisted of a policy arm staffed by five civil servants, and a projects section employing eight private sector executives led by Adrian Montague, formally co-head of Global Project Finance at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort. In 1999 the policy arm of TTF was moved to the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), but it was subsequently moved back to the Treasury. Formation of Partnerships UK The projects section of the TTF was part- privatised and became Partnerships UK (PUK) in 2000. The Treasury retained a 49% 'golden share' in PUK managed by the Shareholder Executive, while the majority stake in the company was owned by private sector investors. PUK was staffed almost entirely by private sector procurement specialists such as corporate lawyers, investment bankers and consultants. It took the lead role in promoting PFI and other public‚Äìprivate partnership variants within government, and was in control of the policy's day-to-day implementation. Closure In June 2010, Infrastructure UK (IUK) was established as a separate unit within the Treasury to work alongside the private sector on major infrastructure projects. As a result, it was announced in May 2011 that PUK was to be dissolved. Some PUK assets, services, data and staff moved to IUK and Local Partnerships (a joint venture between PUK and the Local Government Association) with other assets being sold during 2011.

Records is a British independent record label, run by Jack Clothier and Kevin Douch formed in 2006 when the pair lived together in East Oxford. The label works with the likes of DZ Deathrays, Johnny Foreigner, Fight Like Apes, Anamanaguchi, Peaness, TIGERCUB, Gaffa Tape Sandy, The Spook School, Nelson Can, and QI. Inception Alcopop! Records was formally created after a small loan was gambled on the Charlton vs Portsmouth match of 16 September 2006, with money for the first release and show generated from a successful bet on the match. This money was invested in a band from Yeovil called Encyclopedia, with the first single \\"Emily\\" (Alcopop001) kicking off the 2006/7 singles club (which also included the likes of Midget, data.select.party and 4 or 5 Magicians). Founder Jack pOp, in a recent interview with the Complete Music Update website, said \\"Alcopop! was born back in 2006 with a three figure loan from my Dad and a fuzzy idea to mix up some classic 90s indie and some awesome new stuff and ‚Äì via a series of handmade, special three-inch CDs ‚Äì do our bit to prove that physical music wasn‚Äôt dead. We got drunk, bet a large chunk of the money on a football match, and Congolese striker Lomana LuaLua ensured that we had enough cash to get going!\\"  Alcopop! anti-UKIP controversy  In 2015, Alcopop! stepped in after a hacker cancelled UKIP's website contract and temporarily purchased the UKIP website. Claiming they‚Äôd fill the website with multi-coloured unicorns or donate the website to a pro-immigration agency, the website nevertheless was soon forcibly recovered and returned to the political party by provider GoDaddy. UKIP later blamed 'gremlins in the system'. Alcopop! then proceeded to collaborate with Shikari Sound System to release 7\\" record \\"The Wit and Wisdom of Nigel Farage\\" which was, of course, completely silent. The release profits went to Migrants Rights Network and was in homage to a similar stunt by Stiff Records against Ronald Reagan. Alcopop! interesting formats As well as operating more standard album and EP releases on CD and vinyl, Alcopop! Records prides itself on releasing through a host of different formats, and has put out singles and EPs on the likes of frisbees (Johnny Foreigner Certain Songs are Cursed EP), scarves (My First Tooth Sleet and Snow EP), bespoke watches (Gunning for Tamar Time Trophies EP) and a Minidisc (Stagecoach ‚Äì Say Hi to the Band). When asked about motivation for producing these different formats in a recent interview, Jack pOp stated \\"For me the it‚Äôs more than what is on that record‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about the experience from the moment you get it, how the artwork makes you feel, being able to show it to friends ‚Äì the anticipation of dropping the needle/ pressing the play button‚Ä¶ I genuinely love it.\\" In 2014 Alcopop! re-released the hit song \\"Steal My Sunshine\\" on cassette with co-founders Jack and Kev drawn into the re-imagined sleeve alongside some of the original cast. Other notable releases Alcopop! were the first label in the UK to release a podcast on vinyl, collaborating with the QI Elves to put out a special edition of their 'No Such Thing As A Fish' podcast on vinyl ‚Äì which came with 52 episodes of the podcast on the download card. The record included a bonus track from Corey Taylor of Slipknot fame on the B-side. Working with Brighton grunge band TIGERCUB in 2017, Alcopop! put out the world's first Pay What You Want 12\\" vinyl. Preceded by a physical mailout campaign to all existing fans of the band, the original pressing sold out within 24 hours and was considered a success by singer Jamie Hall, who stated \\"We were worried people wouldn‚Äôt give a shit, but it quickly turned into fucking Wikileaks.

Charles Shaw Lovell established his shipping agent‚Äôs business in 1869 and the business relationship with Bristol General Steam Navigation Company began in earnest in 1896. As part of the deal that saw Bristol Steam buy Gloucester Steamship Company, Lovell was issued with almost 25% of the ordinary capital of the company.

The ship sank with the loss of three crew members. The Calypso was an 1865-built screw steamer which was on a voyage from Antwerp to Gloucester in November 1890. Because of the bad weather it sheltered in the lee of the shore of Dungeness and was anchored with a number of other ships during the night. In the morning the Calypso was hit by the Spanish steamer Pinzon, damaged she was beached at Dungeness. The tug Zeelander then towed the Calpyso stern first in an attempt to take her to Dover. They soon got into trouble and the Sandgate lifeboat was called to remove the crew just before the vessel sank. On 7 April 1899 the newly built Cato was on her second voyage from Cardiff to Hamburg encountered bad weather on the north coast of Cornwall. The ship sank and eight lives were lost and the Board of Trade held an inquiry, the inquiry cleared the master of any wrongful act. In February 1916 the steamer Argo sank with the loss of one life.

Early life Born January 9, 1834, at Morwenstow, Cornwall, England, the son of the Rev. Francis Wolferstan Thomas, Rural Dean and Rector of Parkham, North Devon, a family held living through the Reverend's mother's family, the Wolferstans of Berry House, Hartland, Devon, descended from the Wolferstans of Statfold Hall, Staffordshire. Francis' mother was \\"a lady of the ancient and important family of Shearme, whose seat is Woodlands, Cornwall\\". The Thomas family were formerly possessed of large estates in Glamorganshire. Educated at Sherborne School, Dorset, he had a classical education as his parents desired for him to enter the church, like his father and grandfather (a Fellow of Oxford University) before him. But Francis wanted a military career, and at the age of seventeen, with no hope of his parents changing their minds, he instead left home for Rice Lake (Ontario), with the intention to seek his fortune farming. Canada In Canada, he met someone who professed to be able to teach him agriculture, but his instructor proved worthless, so he found employment on the Grand Trunk Railway. Idle and adrift in a world of strangers, he was not disheartened and soon secured for himself a position in the Bank of Upper Canada. He was quickly noticed, and offered a job in the Toronto branch of the Bank of Montreal, and his hard work there paid dividends, rising to the position of Manager of the London, Ontario branch office in 1865. In London he also became a director of the Huron and Eerie Savings and Loan Company, a director of the Canada Life Assurance Company, and Deputy Grand Master (Masonic) of the Masonic Lodge there. In 1870, at the recommendation of Edwin Henry King, ex- president of the Bank of Montreal, he accepted the job of Chief Cashier at Molson's Bank in Montreal. In Montreal, he served as vice President of the MacKay Institution for Protestant Deaf-Mutes; a member of the managing committee for the Montreal General Hospital, and was a director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and of the Mount Royal Cemetery. It was said of him that \\"his hand is never closed when she (the Church of England) needs his help, though at the same time he does not refuse his aid to any meritorious object, because its promoters differ from him in creed.\\" Family In 1861, he married his first wife, Harriet Amelia Goodhue, third daughter of The Hon. George Jervis Goodhue and his wife Louisa, daughter of Major The Hon. John Matthews, Aide-de-camp to the Governor General of Canada, Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond. Part of Matthews' Canadian estate was sold to the eccentric Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell. The first Mrs Thomas (whose sister married a son of Bishop Benjamin Cronyn) helped her husband in his many philanthropic and beneficent efforts. She became an elective governor of the Mackay Institute for the Deaf and Blind, the first directress of the Church Home, treasurer of the Ladies' Protestant Benevolent Society, and president of the Montreal School of Cookery founded by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. They lived in Montreal at 649 Dorchester Street and were the parents of several children including Mrs Duncan MacInnes, Harold Wolferstan Thomas and John Matthews Wolferstan Thomas. After his first wife died, he married Anne Madeleine VanKoughnet (1863‚Äì1945), granddaughter of Colonel Philip VanKoughnet and sister of Lady Casimir Cartwright van Straubenzee. Her father, Matthew, practised law with his brother, Philip Michael Matthew Scott VanKoughnet, the 2nd Chancellor of Upper Canada. Her mother, Elizabeth Hagerman Macaulay (1826‚Äì1899), was a daughter of barrister George Macaulay (1796‚Äì1828), and a niece of John Simcoe Macaulay, Sir James Buchanan Macaulay, Christopher Alexander Hagerman and John Solomon Cartwright. After Wolferstan Thomas died, his widow remarried Frederick Edmund Meredith. By his second marriage, he was the father of three children, one of whom, Shearme, was the second wife of Lt.-Col. John Lionel Philips D.S.O., J.P., D.L., of Abbey Cwmhir Hall, where his widow died. Thomas died in 1900.

The loch was mostly artificial, having been developed as a curling pond, fed by the Hillhouse Burn through seasonal flooding. The loch was drained via Holehouse Farm Burn. History =Origins= Northern end of the old loch and curling venue. Newfarm Loch looking south-east. This curling loch, covering approximately 0.33 ha and around 2 feet deep, was established by co-operation between the Duke of Portland's factor and the local curling clubs in 1845;Curling Pond Sites Retrieved : 2011-03-18 the site was prone to seasonal flooding from the Hillhouse Burn and being shallow it froze over quickly and was relatively safe. A match is recorded from as early as 1843. Newfarm Loch, which was once popular as a curling rink, was rented by several curling clubs,McKay, Page 135 also used by ice skaters. Photographs circa 1900 shows a stone built pavilion or curling house at the site with a long wooden canopy and the 1938 Ordnance Survey map shows two pavilions situated on the loch banks either side of the access from Newfarm Loch.Curlers on Newfarm Loch Retrieved : 2010-12-28 =Decline= By 1957 the pavilions and curling storage buildings had disappeared and the loch is marked as disused. In 1957/8 a local from New Farm recorded that the fields around the loch were littered with curling stones and the loch itself, although drained, was still very visible; an oblong shape totally surrounded by trees with the drainage apparatus at the end and a sawmill on the edge nearest to New Farm. The Dick Institute in Kilmarnock holds oil paintings and photographs of curlers on New Farm Loch. One, by local artist Alexander MacKay, shows a late afternoon view, there are crowds out on the ice, with a wide range of townsfolk. Several games of curling underway but some are entertaining themselves by pushing others over. This partly artificial loch provided ice for curling and skating for over 100 years.Painting of New Farm Loch Retrieved : 2010-12-28 In the early days of the new scheme the loch was used as a site for grand fetes.New Farm Loch at 40 Site Retrieved 2010-12-28 =Present day= The loch site is still bordered by mature trees planted to provide shelter for the curlers. It has not been built on, apart from a sports facility and children's swings, etc. It is however surrounded on three sides by houses and apartments built between 1968 and the mid-1970s. New Farm itself no longer exists; it stood about one field's distance away from the loch.bebo Account Retrieved : 2010-12-28 Remains of the old sluice are visible close to the old overflow. An extensive drainage system now prevents the loch from becoming marshy ground or filling again. The drainage ditch ran from the southern end towards Holehouse Farm where it joined the Hillhouse Burn, running into the New Mill Burn, eventually emptying into the River Irvine. The village has numerous shops and businesses, one of which is local convenience store \\"Keystore\\" which is owned by local wife beater Alex McIntosh and his son, a notorious cocaine dealer, Steven McIntosh.In early 2018 Alex McIntosh unjustly sacked a trusty and loyal employee who had been there since the opening of the store. for \\"huffing gas behind the building and stealing from the til\\" even though there was proof that this wasn't true.

The victims included many shop staff and people on shopping trips, and the passengers of a bus that had been passing the scene. The explosion destroyed several shops and a terraced car park. An inquiry was held, and a jury on 11 February 1972 returned a verdict that no fault for the explosion lay with any organization or individual. No cause was identified for the ignition of the leaked gas, and the leak itself was deemed the result of an accidental gas main fracture caused by \\"stress and corrosion\\".

It is composed of vector-borne haemosporidian parasites that infect a wide range of mammals such as primates, rodents and bats. Its vertebrate hosts are bats. First described by Garnham and Heisch in 1953, Nycteria is mostly found in bat species where it feeds off the blood of their hosts and causes disease. Within the host, Nycteria develops into peculiar lobulated schizonts in parenchyma cells of the liver, similarly to the stages of Plasmodum falciparum in the liver. The vector of Nycteria has been hard to acquire and identify. Because of this, the life cycle of Nycteria still remains unknown and understudied. It has been suggested that this vector could be an arthropod rather than a mosquito or the vector of most haemosporidian parasites. Etymology The word Nycteris is derived from the Greek word ‚Äúnykteros‚Äù, also ‚Äúbat‚Äù. Nycteris is a bat genus in the family Nycteridae, and the genus name Nycteria was given to underline the relationship between these bats and their parasites. Historical background Nycteria was first described by Garnham and Heisch in 1953, where they discovered a new form of blood parasite (Nycteria medusiformis) in Kenya responsible for malaria in the Egyptian tomb bat Taphozous perforates. Description To date, Nycteria has been characterized based on parasite blood and tissue stages, which are limited to gametocytes. The earliest morphological description of Nycteria was from discovery of Nycteria medusiformis in the insectivorous bat Taphozous perforates, where gametocytes of the species were found in the blood of their host and asexual development of the parasite was confined to the parenchyma cells of the liver. Members of the genus Nycteria lack erythrocytic schizogony, which is a specific replication phase inside red blood cells responsible for causing malaria. Instead, they develop into peculiar lobulated schizonts of less than 100 Œºm in size, similar to Plasmodum falciparum stages in the liver. They consist of characteristic filaments that protrude from the surface of the parasitized blood cells; however, these filaments were not considered to be cellular structures of the parasite itself, but as degenerative formations of the erythrocyte. The size (numerical value unknown) of these gametocytes were also described. Round male gametocytes of Nycteria were also found to rarely occupy the host erythrocyte completely. A recent study also showed similar morphological characteristics of the gametocytes in N. medusiformis They found mature gametocytes completely filled the red blood cells of the infected species and were slightly enlarged by 2 Œºm more than uninfected red blood cells. Filaments expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes were also found, as originally described, and became fewer and shorter as the gametocytes matured and sometimes disappeared at later stages. Fine pigment grains were found scattered irregularly throughout the cytoplasm and highly chromophilic macrogametocytes had a dark blue-purple color containing a small, condensed nuclei. Microgametocytes had a pale, pink color containing a small, central condensation of chromatin possibly reminiscent of a rosette ‚Äì groupings of cells usually found in tumors. Another species of the genus, N. grandis, also showed similar morphological structure of the Nycteria gametocyte to N. medusiformis, but lack highly characteristic filaments as seen in N. medusiformis. Therefore, the morphotype of N. grandis differed from N. medusiformis by size, nucleus of the microgametocytes, and pigment features. Unfortunately, insufficient data on Nycteria gametocytes in N. grandis does not allow a full description of the species. Due to lack understanding of the vector of Nycteria, details of its pre-erythrocytic cycle remain unknown. Habitat and ecology Nycteria is prevalent in African bats, feeding on the blood of their hosts. Although the identity of the vector in Nycteria still remains unresolved during their parasitic life cycle, it has been suggested that it could possibly be an arthropod other than a mosquito. It is also hypothesized that the vectors of Nycteria belong to the family Diptera, since most haemosporidian parasites are transmitted through blood- sucking dipteran insects. Future research To date, studies of haemosporidian parasites are highly neglected. Further research on the genus might offer previous unrecognized insights into the evolution of human pathogens, as well into diverse parasite strategies to achieve stable transmission to host populations.

The objectives of prison confinement in Wales is threefold: to \\"hold prisoners securely\\", to \\"reduce the risk of prisoners re-offending\\" and to \\"provide safe and well-ordered establishments in which we treat prisoners humanely, decently and lawfully\\". Although the concept of incarceration as a punishment for wrongdoing did not exist in Wales, as in the rest of Britain, during the medieval period, from Tudor times onwards correction houses began appearing throughout the country. In the 18th century several buildings began taking on the function of modern prisons, and in 1878 Welsh prisons came under centralised government control. Today there are five prisons in Wales; three are run directly by the government with Parc Prison in Bridgend being Wales' only privatised gaol. History of prisons in Wales The concept of incarcerating individuals as a punishment for crimes did not exist in Wales before or during the medieval period.Davies (2008), p. 713 The early castles of the Welsh rulers and marcher-lords did possess dungeons, but the purpose of these facilities were for the confinement of hostages and political prisoners, people who may have committed no crime. Up to the 17th century the most common punishments for criminal offences were fines, corporal punishment and executions. The earliest forms of prisons, which began appearing in the early modern period, were created for the purposes of holding those awaiting trial and to house debtors. From the Tudor period magistrates were given powers by the state to establish correction houses for the punishment of those committing petty crimes and a way to amend the ways of vagrants. From the 18th century the institutions that would begin to have the function of modern prisons began to appear in Aberystwyth, Bangor and Beaumaris. These buildings were used to house criminals for a set period of time after being sentenced by a court. The condition of early prisons in Wales was rudimentary and with few amenities for the imprisoned. In his 1777 work State of the Prisons prison reformer John Howard mentions two Welsh gaols, Caernarfon county gaol and Swansea town gaol. Caernarfon is described as having neither drainage or fresh water and the inmates housed in tiny windowless cells.Davies (2008), p. 714 Prisons in Wales were often of very poor build, many of which were not built for the purpose of housing prisoners, and were often the sites of existing buildings. Haverfordwest prison was originally built in the inner ward of a ruined castle in 1778. It was considered unfit for prisoners in 1819, while Cardiff Gaol was deemed insufficient in 1814. Some prisons were built for purpose, including Beaumaris Gaol (1829) in Anglesey. In 1878 the prison system in Wales was nationalised and came under centralised government control. This led to better conditions and fewer, larger prisons. The smaller prisons and gaols across the country were closed and the location of the prisons centralised. Until 2017 there was no provision for prisoners in northern Wales, with prisoners sent to prisons in Liverpool and further afield. In 2009 a site was discussed for a new prison in Caernarfon to address the issue of Welsh prisoners who are housed in England, but this fell through. In 2013 the government announced the construction of a new ¬£250 million 'super prison' in Wrexham. Work on the new prison, named HMP Berwyn, commenced in 2014 and it became partially operational in February 2017. Current prisons in Wales There are five prisons in Wales, * Berwyn (2017) a Category C men's prison, located in Wrexham is the UK's largest prison with a capacity of 2,106. Berwyn is the Prison Service's flagship prison. * Usk (1844) a Category C men's prison which also includes a satellite site ** Prescoed (1939) a Category D men's open prison; * Cardiff (1832) a Category B men's prison, * Parc (1997) a Category B men's private prison and Young Offenders Institution, based in Bridgend, is Wales' only privatised prison and is presently run by G4S, * Swansea (1861) a Category B/C men's prison. Wales has no prison for either women or Category A offenders, who must be housed in gaols in England.

The walls were battle-mented and loop-holed, and had semi- circular towers at the angles, on which guns were once mounted. The inner portion was occupied by recesses similar to those in the city walls. To the right of the entrance was a high terrace extending the whole length of the ground enclosed. *Kali Masjid, Jama Masjid: Among the mosques, the Jumma Masjid and the Kali Masjid, built by Malik Ambar, and the Shah Ganj mosque, are the most conspicuous. Malik Ambar is said to have built seven mosques which go by the general name of Kali Masjid. The Kali Masjid is in Juna Bazar area and was erected in 1600 A. D.

The mosque is on a raised platform, and has shops on three of the outer sides; while the fourth or the north side is open and is ascended by a flight of steps. The facade represents an arcade of five scalloped arches, constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style, and supported on stone pillars.

The garden also contains several ruined cisterns and fountains. The gate is rather imposing and has a large pointed archway, forming a sort of portico. The actual entrance is through a small arch at the further extremity. The parapet is nearly ornamented, and so is the facade, which has three small windows with pointed arches, beside recesses. Each corner of the terrace has a little tower surmounted with a bulbous dome and a spire. The mausoleum is square in plan, and has five pointed arches on each side and similar domed towers at the corners. The interior is connected by a system of arches, corresponding with those on the sides and carrying a series of little domes. *Sunehri Mahal: The Sunehri Mahal in Paharsingpura was erected by a Bundelkhand chief who accompanied Aurangzeb into the Deccan.

The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.

History The station was opened to the public on 25 April 1864, simultaneously with the Ortona‚ÄìFoggia section of the Adriatic Railway. Earlier, on 9 November 1863, King Victor Emmanuel II had officially opened the section between Pescara and Foggia, by setting forth aboard a special train, on track that had been hurriedly completed especially for the event. On 12 March 1882, the station became a junction station, upon the opening of the first section of the Termoli‚ÄìVenafro railway, between Termoli and Larino. Features The station has two passenger buildings. One of them is the original structure, and the other was built in the 1980s. The configuration of the original passenger building is fairly typical for Italian railway stations. The original building is constructed of brick, and is made up of three sections. Its middle section has three levels, while the other two sections, extending laterally from each side of the middle section, are both single storey structures. To the south (or Foggia/Campobasso) side of this main building are other, smaller, buildings used for storage. Attached to the north (or Pescara) side of the original building is the second building, which evidently has much more modern architectural lines than the first, and represents a sharp contrast with the surrounding buildings. It was built of reinforced concrete, and it has tinted glass windows. Passenger facilities at the station are: ticket office, cafeteria, waiting rooms, elevators, toilets, bar, newsagent, pharmacy and the office of the Railway Police. The station yard has five tracks with platforms for passenger traffic. Each platform is accessible from the others by an underpass, which also functions as a pedestrian link between two parts of the city: Viale Trieste and Piazza Garibaldi (or station square). Renovations In October 2010, work was completed on the modernization of the facade of the passenger building overlooking Piazza Garibaldi and its waiting rooms and interior passages. Due to the poor condition of the areas used for the accommodation of people waiting for trains, intervention was required at the front of the building housing the ticket office and offices, along with modernization work and a new coat of paint. Additionally, the platform facing the Adriatic Railway was raised to a height of , thus allowing easier access to trains by reducing the gap in height between the platform surface and that of the carriage floors. There was also some restoration work done to some of the platform shelters. The work took about five months to complete. Train services The station has about 780,000 passenger movements each year. It has a catchment area that encompasses almost all of Molise. All InterCity and Eurostar trains passing through the station stop there. The station is also served by many regional trains. The main destinations for trains leaving Termoli are Foggia, Campobasso, Pescara and, recently, Teramo. Until a few years ago, there were also direct trains to Naples and Rome.

The present building, which is no longer used for worship, has 13th-century origins, but a church may have existed on the site in the 11th century or earlier. Often administered in connection with other churches in the rural area of West Sussex in which it was built‚Äìchurches at nearby Steyning, Ashington and Thakeham were all involved with it at various times‚Äìits congregations declined and closure came first in the 1920s and then for good in 1979, when it was declared redundant. Unlike many ancient churches in Sussex, it was not subject to restoration in the mid-19th century: its interior has been called \\"the finest example in Sussex of how many must have looked before the Victorian restorers\\". After a period in which the Early English Gothic stone-built church fell into dereliction, prompting one Sussex historian to lament its \\"unloved\\" appearance, it was taken into the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. History Warminghurst (from Old English meaning \\"the high wood of Wyrma's people\\") is an ancient parish at the south of the Weald, close to where the South Downs rise. It is long from north and south, narrow and largely rural; its village, never very large, has disappeared since the medieval era. Development was always scattered rather than nucleated because the land around the church and manor house sloped steeply away on all sides. One of the earliest descriptions of Warminghurst was as an appurtenance of Steyning, a more significant nearby town, and although the Domesday survey of 1086 mentioned two churches in the latter, one may have been at Warminghurst. A church is known to have stood in the parish by the late 12th century, when the name of the village was Werningcherch. The present church, a simple sandstone building, was built at the end of a lane a short distance from the church in neighbouring Thakeham in about 1220. Early in its history it was, like its mother church at Steyning, owned by the Benedictine abbey at F√©camp in Normandy, to which tithes were payable. A connection with Steyning was maintained until the early 17th century, when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre became independent. Structurally, the church changed little from its early 13th-century appearance: a long single room with no division (in the form of a chancel arch) between the chancel and nave and an unbroken roofline over them, lit by lancet windows on each side and an oculus above the entrance. Above the west end, the wood and shingled bell-turret is the oldest part of the building: its timbers have been dated to 1158. The bell it houses, cast in about 1200, is one of the oldest survivors in Sussex. The three-light east window, containing plain glass and with quatrefoils at the top, dates from the 14th century (possibly as early as 1300) and is in the Decorated Gothic style. In the absence of any structural division between the chancel and the nave, a large wooden screen was erected instead in about 1700. This three-arched structure bears an \\"extravagant\\" Royal Arms of Queen Anne in its tympanum. Other 17th-century changes included the insertion of wooden altar rails and an altar table, the repair of the lancet windows with brick, and the construction of a south-side entrance porch. A vestry on the north side, while not contemporary, is of a similar era. Some small-scale work was carried out before 1724 by James Butler, the year in which Bishop of Chichester Thomas Bowers visited the church and remarked \\"church in extraordinarily good repair by the expence of James Butler Esq.\\" Attributed to Butler was the blocking and rebuilding of certain windows and doors (and possibly the repairs in brick described by most sources as dating from the 17th century), the tall three- deck pulpit, and the font with its \\"bulgy stem\\" and very rare \\"font crane\\" (an iron bracket used to pull up the font cover). In about 1770, a set of box-pews was installed, with high backs and lockable ends; unusually, these survive in excellent condition. Such seats were \\"complete anathema to 19th-century restorers\\"; the church remained untouched at that time, making its set of pews the most notable in Sussex according to one source. The ecclesiastical status of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre varied over the centuries following its split from Steyning. Late 16th-century curates and rectors were also linked to the churches at Thakeham and Itchingfield; after a long period in the late 17th century when the church had a resident vicar, curates once more served the church, usually from Thakeham but later from Ashington; and from 1845 the vicar of Ashington celebrated services himself. The parish was linked with that of Thakeham throughout the 18th century, until 1804; soon afterwards, until the church's first closure, it was linked to Ashington. A period of closure from about 1920 until 1933 led to damage by vandals, and repairs were carried out prior to the church's reopening. More damage, this time associated with the Second World War and declining congregations, led to the only full- scale restoration in the church's history: John Leopold Denman of the firm Denman & Sons carried out a \\"very sensitive\\" series of works (\\"beautifully done\\" according to Nikolaus Pevsner) in 1959‚Äì60, in which all parts of the building were inspected and structural defects corrected, the east window was improved and the ceiling was stripped down to reveal its original timbers. The church was officially reunited with Thakeham again in 1940; it had been served from there since its 1933 reopening. The declining number of worshippers made it unviable, though, and on 1 April 1979 the Diocese of Chichester declared the Church of the Holy Sepulchre redundant. After that date, it was no longer used for religious services, and by 1984 a Sussex writer observed that \\"it looks as if nobody loves it any more\\" and feared potential demolition. However, on 21 April 1980, under the provisions of Section 50 of the Pastoral Measure 1983, the Diocese of Chichester had placed the church into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund (now the Churches Conservation Trust). This registered charity looks after architecturally significant Anglican churches which are no longer used for regular worship. The building has been restored and is now open for visitors every day. It is considered particularly worth visiting for its \\"tranquillity ... and the breathtaking views to the south\\" towards Chanctonbury Ring. The Church Conservation Trust looks after four other redundant churches in West Sussex, at Chichester, Church Norton, North Stoke and Tortington. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 15 March 1955. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of 38 Grade I listed buildings, and 1,726 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Horsham. Architecture and fittings The former church from the adjacent lane The Church of the Holy Sepulchre has a simple layout, only slightly altered from its 13th-century origins. It consists of a long, low single cell containing nave and chancel, a porch on the south side (now blocked, and containing the original entrance door), a vestry (formerly a private chapel) on the north side, an entrance in the liturgical west end and a bell-turret topped with a broach spire on the roof at the liturgical east end. The porch and vestry are of brick, but the rest of the building is stone with some protective render in places. There is no chancel arch. A round window of the 13th century sits high in the gabled west wall‚Äîa structure which has some local marble laid in courses. Other windows are single-light lancets, mostly given brick surrounds in the 17th or 18th century. The east window is wider, with three lights and quatrefoils‚Äîa good example of a simple 14th-century window in the Decorated Gothic style. Inside, the roof is also simple: single-framed with a few exposed beams. It probably dates from when the church was built. The church has a \\"typically 18th- century\\" interior despite its mostly 13th-century exterior. The pale woodwork (mostly pine), large areas of plain glass and whitewashed walls give a bright appearance. The best feature, with no rival in Sussex for completeness and structural condition, is the late 18th-century pine box pews with Gothic Revival-style tracery at the ends. Also described by one historian as the best in the county is the rare three-deck pulpit, also of the 18th century. The pine screen between the nave and chancel has a \\"splendid\\" and \\"wonderfully na√Øve\\" painted plasterwork Royal Arms in its tympanum, repainted in 1845. Such examples, painted straight on plaster and mounted on woodwork, are unusual in Sussex. The north chapel was built in 1619 by Henry Shelley as a vault and private chapel for the Shelley family. One family member, Edward Shelley (died 1554), is commemorated by a small brass memorial in a Perpendicular Gothic- style wall recess, depicting his wife and ten children kneeling in front of him. Other memorials include two large \\"Baroque-style\\" 18th-century tablets decorated with the heads of putti, and three hanging monuments in marble‚Äîa style which became popular in Sussex in the 17th and 18th centuries.

This organization is responsible for the affairs related to the retirement of Iran's civil servants. The regular military, law enforcement agencies, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran‚Äôs second major military organization, have their own pension systems. Iran did not legislate in favor of a universal social protection, but in 1996, the Center of the Statistics of Iran estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by social security. Membership in the social security system for all employees is compulsory. Beneficiaries In 2012, CSPO had 1.1 million pensioners. CSPO's beneficiaries include: #Civil servants covered by Management of Government Services Law. #Faculty members of universities & institutes of higher education employed as tenure teaching staff. #Judges employed by judiciary Branch and Ministry of Justice covered by their respective rules and regulations. #Tenure diplomats of Ministry of Foreign Affairs covered by their respective rules & regulations. #Tenure employees of municipalities, excluding mayors. #Contract employees of executive branch requesting to be covered by civil servants Pension Fund. #The self-employeds (bought out employees of Ministry of Roads and article 147 of Fourth Development Plan.) Funding The pension systems is based on the defined benefit which is the standard model (vs the defined contribution model). In 2012, CSPO had 1 million public employees contributing to the fund. The government is also supporting financially the CSPO. Due to the reduced amount of resources CSPO gathers from public employees, the system now relies more on government resources. In the future, the system will no longer rely on the government budget, and shift focus toward a (privately) funded system. The pension system will have three major pillars such as: #Social insurance, #Social support, #Complementary and supplementary retirement insurance. Investments Civil Pension Fund Investment Company is the investment arm of CSPO. As of 2012, the fund‚Äôs investments allocation was as follows: #Chemical and petrochemical sectors: 31%, #Oil and gas companies: 17% (e.g. Iranol and Pasargad) #Transportation and communications: 11% (e.g. the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), Aseman Airlines) #Tourism (e.g. Iran Touring & Tourism Company.)

He was the editor of Great Houses of the Hudson River (2001), and the author of Carolands (2006). Education and career Michael Dwyer received a master's degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. He was associated from 1981‚Äì96 with the architecture firm Buttrick White & Burtis, where he was a member of the project team that designed the Saint Thomas Choir School, a fifteen-story boarding school in Midtown Manhattan, completed in 1987.\\"St. Thomas Choir School,\\" Progressive Architecture, March 1992 (Supplemental Issue).< He helped design the Dana Discovery Center in New York City's Central Park, completed in 1993 as part of the Central Park Conservancy's rehabilitation of the Harlem Meer. In an interview with the magazine Progressive Architecture in December 1993, Dwyer noted that the building's \\"picturesque character\\" reinforced the park's \\"romantic landscape design.\\"Philip Arcidi, \\"Learning by the Rules,\\" Progressive Architecture, December 1, 1993. In 1992‚Äì93, he was part of the team of architects that restored Bonnie Dune, the Southampton residence of Ambassador Carl Spielvogel and his wife, the preservationist Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, a project executed in collaboration with the interior designer Jed Johnson.Jay Johnson, Jed Johnson: Opulent Restraint (Rizzoli, 2005). During his time at Buttrick White & Burtis, Dwyer was an advocate of New York's prewar, classical style of architecture. In a 1995 survey by The New York Times of New York's then-emerging neoclassical school of architecture, the reporter Patricia Leigh Brown noted that, \\"Michael Dwyer...an architect at Buttrick White & Burtis...has recently completed a classical-style yacht and an $8.95 million town house on the Upper East Side and is renovating Rudolph Nureyev's former apartment in the Dakota.\\"Patricia Leigh Brown, \\"Architecture's Young Old Fogies,\\" The New York Times, February 9, 1995. In 1996, after establishing his own firm, Dwyer was the architect for the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument in New York City's Riverside Park, designed by the landscape architects Kelly/Varnell, with a statue sculpted by Penelope Jencks. The surrounding granite pavement contains inscriptions designed by Dwyer, including a quotation from Roosevelt's 1958 speech at the United Nations advocating universal human rights.Jean Parker Phifer, Public Art New York (New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co., 2009). In 1997, he restored the exterior of the George F. Baker House, a designated New York City landmark, and from 1998‚Äì2008, he was the architect for the restoration of the Cosmopolitan Club, a private social club for women. In addition to institutional projects, Dwyer designed residential projects for the upper strata of New York's private sector, working for clients such as Eddie Lampert, Scott Bessent, Carl Spielvogel and Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel.

The club colours are blue and yellow and they are nicknamed the Goannas. They currently have five teams: Men's Platinum Division, Platinum Reserves, & Under 19s; and Women's Division 1 and Division 2. All teams play in the Sydney AFL league. The Goannas home ground is Gipps Road Oval located in the western Sydney suburb of Greystanes, part of the local city of Holroyd. History The club formed in 1979 (reserves only) as Parramatta with a senior team instigated in 1980. The club changed its name to Holroyd-Parramatta in 1983 before a merger with Blacktown in 1995. In 2020, the team changed its name to Parramatta Goannas. In 1985, six years after their formation, the Goannas were admitted to Sydney football's primary competition, the SFL (now known as Premier League), where, after a lack lustre couple of seasons, they began to emerge as a genuine force towards the end of the decade. With former Richmond player Ron Thomas at the helm the side qualified for the 1990 finals in second spot behind North Shore before winning the second semi final by 31 points. In the grand final a fortnight later it again met North Shore and, in a spiteful, tempestuous match at the Erskineville Oval, won its first and only SFL pennant by 7 points. Final scores were Holroyd-Parramatta 9.15 (69) defeated North Shore 9.8 (62), with Brian ‚ÄòAlf' Hawke courageously seeing out the entire game for the victors despite sustaining a broken jaw early on. The Goannas retained the nucleus of their premiership side in 1991, but on this occasion fell at the final hurdle. The premiership team included future Sydney Swan player Neil Brunton. The premiership decider featured the same teams as in 1990 and was, if anything, an even more bruising and unpleasant encounter, with the Goannas, despite having only fifteen fit men, doing well to get within a goal during the last term before ultimately going down by 22 points. In 1995, the club decided that it was being over-stretched in the SFL, and took the opportunity of merging with struggling SFA club, Blacktown. In 1995, the club decided that it was being over-stretched in the SFL, and took the opportunity of merging with struggling SFA club, Blacktown. The newly merged club would compete in the SFA, the highlight of this period being a 14.10 (94) to 11.11 (77) grand final defeat of Wollongong in 2001. in 2018, the Goannas became home to its inaugural women's team in AFL Sydney's Women's Division 2 competition. The ladies of 2018 went on to win the flag that year in a comprehensive 7.8.50-1.5.11 win over Camden Cats - a quickly established rivalry that still exists. In 2019, the Goannas ladies expanded to include a new Division 3 team as the 2018 premiers were promoted to Division 1. After finishing Minor Premiers, Division 2 went down in a hard-fought battle against the St George Dragons in the grand final. 2020 was the Goannas ladies most dominant year finishing Minor Premiers after an unbeaten season and a hard-to-believe winning percentage of 817.65%. Continuing the rivalry against Camden Cats, the Goannas won the Grand Final 4.10 (34) - 0.1 (1) to finish 2020 Division 1 Premiers. Arguably the Goannas' most famous player was Mark Taylor (cricketer), who won the club's best and fairest award in 1983, and later went on to captain the Australian Test cricket team. Taylor is the current club patron of the Goannas.

It was the world‚Äôs first pumped-storage facility to use seawater for storing energy. Its maximum output was 30 MW. Construction of the plant started in 1987 and was completed in 1999 at a cost of ¬•3.2 billion and was dismantled in 2016.  Facility  The power station was a pure pumped-storage facility, using the Pacific Ocean as its lower reservoir, with an effective drop of 136 m and maximum flow of 26 m¬≥/s. Its pipelines and pump turbine were installed underground. Its maximum output was approximately 2.1% of the maximum power demand in the Okinawa Island recorded on August 3, 2009. The upper reservoir, artificially excavated, was approximately away from the shoreline and approximately above sea level. It had an octagonal planar shape with a maximum width of . Its maximum depth was and its effective storage capacity was . The entire inner surface of the reservoir was covered with an impermeable liner to prevent seawater from leaking and damaging the surrounding vegetation. Fiber- reinforced plastic tubes were adopted for the penstock and the tailrace instead of steel tubes in order to avoid seawater corrosion and adhesion of barnacles. The pump turbine was partially made of stainless steel resistant to seawater. A 66 kV line connected the power station with the power grid of The Okinawa Electric Power Company.  History  The power station was a pilot plant funded by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy and constructed by the Electric Power Development Company. A five-year verification operation was conducted beginning on May 16, 1999. The Japan Society of Civil Engineers presented the company an Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award on May 26, 2000 for its construction of the plant. The operator could not put the power station into practical use because the demand for electric power in Okinawa had not grown as predicted, and the plant was not profitable as a business. The power plant was dismantled in July 2016.

The tale of a young Al Bowlly obsessive attempting to blot out memories of sexual abuse via his fixation with the singer, the play was the first of Potter's works to use popular music as a dramatic device and strongly anticipated Potter's later 'serials with songs' Pennies from Heaven (1978), The Singing Detective (1986) and Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). Synopsis Al Bowlly obsessive David Peters (Ian Holm) is visited in his run-down bedsit by Marie (Deborah Grant), a researcher for Severn Television, who is collecting material for a documentary about the singer. David is the editor of the Al Bowlly Appreciation Society fanzine and Marie hopes to secure him as the programme advisor. David is enthusiastic about the offer but has other things on his mind; he has an appointment with an NHS psychiatrist the following day and his anxiety about the meeting, coupled with the novelty of entertaining his beautiful visitor, leads him to make an unwelcome pass at her. Marie fights off his advances and runs out the flat, leaving a defeated David to reflect on his problems. In the waiting room the next day, David gets into an altercation with an elderly patient who has never heard of Al Bowlly. By the time he is finally called to see Dr Chilton (Anthony Bate), David is agitated by the older man's ignorance ‚Äì especially as today is the anniversary of Bowlly's death. The doctor's calm demeanour, however, soon puts David at ease and, with some difficulty, David explains that his mother died six weeks earlier after having nursed her throughout his adult life and harrowingly recounts how, at the age of ten, he was abducted by a stranger and sexually assaulted. Alongside these traumatic events, David hints as some \\"wicked\\" acts he has committed but Chilton stops him before he can elaborate on these and prescribes him some anti-depressants. He is warned not to drink alcohol or eat cheese while taking the tablets as they will \\"make [his] tongue wag.\\" After David leaves, Chilton informs the two student doctors who have been in attendance throughout the session that he believes David's claustrophobic relationship with his disabled mother and the earlier torment of sexual abuse have resulted in a sense of sexual disgust that he overcomes in his obsession with the innocent music of Al Bowlly. Chilton dismisses his junior colleagues' concerns that David may attempt suicide and suggests it is more likely that the desperate desire to discharge his secrets will perhaps lead him to confide in a friend. Later that evening, David attends the annual meeting of the Al Bowlly Appreciation Society. Relieved that his ordeal with the psychiatrist is over, David forgets the warning not to mix his medication with alcohol and drinks heavily. After much merriment, the Society President calls David up on stage to talk about the success of the fanzine. As David holds forth in his speech about the beauty and innocence of Bowlly's music his mind wanders back to the sexual assault and, realising he is surrounded by friends whose attitudes to love and sex match his own, reveals that he has slept with 136 prostitutes. As he leaves the stage and the scandalised Society members return to their festivities, a jubilant David approaches a large blow-out of Bowlly mounted on the wall.

Trodd acted as musical advisor on the play, a role he reprised for Potters later 'serials with songs' and the 1981 MGM film version of Pennies from Heaven. Moonlight on the Highway contains a number of semi- autobiographical elements. In 1945 the ten-year-old Potter and his sister June went to stay with their mother's relatives in Hammersmith, West London. Potter shared a bedroom with his bachelor uncle Ernie who sexually abused him. Potter first spoke publicly about the event in his introduction to Waiting for the Boat (published 1984) and later during his James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the 1993 Edinburgh Television Festival. The main character of Moonlight appears to live in Hammersmith and it is established during a montage sequence that the abuse David suffers occurred sometime around VJ Day, as Potter declared his had. In Humphrey Carpenter's 1998 Potter biography, Kenith Trodd claimed that at an unspecified point in the early 1960s Potter confessed to having regularly used prostitutes while working in London; the number of women he visited allegedly matched the number of David Peters' conquests in Moonlight. Gareth Davies, who directed several of Potter's plays in the 1960s, also claims that Potter admitted to using prostitutes around this time but this time the number was much higher. These claims, however, have not been substantiated. The play text was substantially cut for time, with twenty minutes of material featuring David's encounters with prostitutes being excised. Style and themes The play is structured as a nonlinear narrative. The main action of the drama takes place at Chilton's practice, while other scenes (David's attempt to seduce Marie and the meeting of the Al Bowlly Appreciation Society) are incorporated as flashbacks or flashforwards. David's memories of sexual abuse and the death of his mother are represented with overlays and montage sequences, accompanied by Al Bowlly music on the soundtrack. Potter uses Bowlly's songs to represent both David's desire to return to innocence and as a means for the character to express through Bowlly's lyrics the emotions that he can never express in his own words. When David unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Marie he plays her \\"Just Let Me Look at You\\" in the hope that Bowlly's words will make her understand his desire, while during his meeting with Dr Chilton he recites the lyrics of several Bowlly songs to explain the horror of his ordeal at the hands of his abuser. Potter's witty resetting of the meaning behind the Bowlly tracks used throughout the drama finds its apotheosis in the extra-diegetic, and ironic, use of \\"Lover, Come Back to Me\\" and \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\": the former song accompanying David's memories of the assault, the latter as he attempts to recount his experiences to Chilton ‚Äì suggesting the nature of his lost innocence. Intertextuality Potter would later use popular music as a means to heighten the dramatic tension in his work in the serials Pennies from Heaven (1978), The Singing Detective (1986), Lipstick on Your Collar (1993) and the play Cream in My Coffee (1980). The theme of sexual abuse is returned to in Only Make Believe (1973), Brimstone and Treacle (1976), Where Adam Stood (1976), Blue Remembered Hills (1979), Blackeyes (1989), Cold Lazarus (1996) and the novel Hide and Seek (1974). Characters also undergo psychiatric assessment in Follow the Yellow Brick Road (1972), Hide and Seek and The Singing Detective. Broadcast and commercial release The play was broadcast on ITV on 12 April 1969. It was released in the Network DVD collection Dennis Potter at London Weekend Television alongside the dramatist's other work for the company.

In 688/9, Justinian II forcibly transplanted Slavic populations from the Balkans and settled them in the depopulated Opsician Theme. From them, he recruited a special military corps, allegedly 30,000 strong, which was called in Greek ŒªŒ±œåœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒøœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ, \\"the chosen people\\"... In about 690, Neboulos, who already held the rank of skribon and possibly served in the imperial guard, was placed as their commander (archon). Neboulos's own origin is disputed between scholars, with some suggesting a Bulgar origin and others a South Slavic one. According to the account of Patriarch Nikephoros, he was chosen from among the nobility of the Slav settlers. In 692/3, after the corps' training had been completed, they were employed en masse by Justinian II in a major campaign against the Umayyads under the strategos of the Anatolics, Leontios. The Byzantines engaged the Arabs in the Battle of Sebastopolis and initially had the upper hand until Neboulos, with the bulk (some 20,000) of his men, deserted the Byzantine lines and went over to the Arabs, allegedly bribed by the Arab commander, Muhammad ibn Marwan.. Some sources report, probably with great exaggeration, how thereafter Justinian took his revenge on the remaining Slavs: he disbanded the corps, and killed or sold into slavery many of its men, as well as the families of the deserters. Neboulos and his men, on the other hand, were settled by the Umayyads in Syria, and were employed in subsequent Arab forays into Byzantine-held Asia Minor.

Struggles against Yu'firids and Ziyadids Yusuf bin Yahya was a son of the imam al-Mansur Yahya who died in 976. In the following year, Yusuf was proclaimed with the regnal name ad-Da'i Yusuf. His early years were filled with struggles against the Yu'firid Dynasty that ruled much of the Yemeni highland.H.C. Kay, Yaman; Its Early Medieval History. London 1892, p. 227. The important city San'a at this time was subjected to the overlordship of the Sunni Ziyadid dynasty which ruled the Tihamah from its base in Zabid. Ad-Da'i Yusuf managed to gain recognition as prince in San'a and the surrounding province in 978, reciting the khutbah in his own name. Nevertheless, the Ziyadid governor Ibn ad-Dahhak soon fought back.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 57. The last effective Yu'firid ruler Abdallah managed to win back the city and increase his power still by invading the Ziyadid domains and seize Zabid. After Abdallah's death in 997, Yu'firid rule collapsed. Contested leadership For ad-Da'i Yusuf, this was but a brief respite. A rival for the imamate, al-Mansur al-Qasim al- Iyyani appeared in 999. With the assistance of the Hamdan tribesmen, ad-Da'i Yusuf was expelled from Sa'dah, the traditional seat of the imams. A Zaidi Sharif, al-Qasim bin al-Husayn, was dispatched to San'a by the new imam, and the Zaydiyyah communities submitted to him. After some years, al-Qasim bin al- Husayn changed his allegiance to ad-Da'i Yusuf again. Al-Mansur al-Qasim al- Iyyani retired from power in 1002, and ad-Da'i Yusuf ruled for a second term. However, his time was filled with petty fighting over San'a, where the tribesmen of Hamdan and Khawlan played a major role.H.C. Kay, 1892, p. 228. He also had to fight al-Mansur's son who posed as imam under the name al-Mahdi al-Husayn. This uneasy situation persisted until the death of ad-Da'i Yusuf in 1012, after an extremely turbulent reign.

Background In December the most serious terror operation ever uncovered in Denmark before the 2015 Copenhagen shootings was thwarted by a successful cooperation between security services in Denmark and Sweden. Police, accompanied by bomb experts, conducted several raids and detained five men, who were described as militant islamists. Automatic weapons, together with ammunition and silencers, were seized by the police. Plastic strips to use as handcuffs were also found. The terrorists allegedly plotted to conduct a \\"Mumbai-style\\" attack on Jyllands-Posten to revenge the 2005 publishing of the cartoons portraying Muhammad as a terrorist. Investigation As suspects they had been under surveillance for an extended period of time and the arrests were the result of a long investigation. The group travelled to Copenhagen 27 December 2010, Zalouti changed his mind the way to Denmark and returned to J√§rf√§lla. Police arrested the group 28 December 2010 in Copenhagen and Zalouti was arrested on the same day in Sweden. Convictions The men were charged with attempted terrorism and unlawful possession of weapons (a machine gun with silencer, a pistol and more than 100 cartridges). On 4 June 2012 they were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The convicted were transferred to a prison in Sweden, Saltviksanstalten in H√§rn√∂sand which has the highest security level. = Munir Awad = Munir Awad, 29, Lebanese- born Swedish national. He received a sentence of 12 years in prison. He was silent during the trial (Danish: Byret), but told his version of events before the appeal court (Danish: Landsret). The state prosecutor demanded a 14-year sentence, while a lay judge recommended a 10-year sentence. The judges and the other lay judges decided on a sentence of 12 years. While in prison he attempted to contact others by connecting other participants to a phone call with his wife, thereby attempting to communicate with people he was forbidden to contact. According to the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, Awad has a network of contacts among radicalized individuals. He was religiously active in the prison and attempted to radicalize inmates. Munir Awad was previously arrested in Pakistan in 2009 on suspicions of terrorism, together with Mehdi Ghezali, a former Guantanamo-detainee. Notably, Munir Awad is the son-in-law of , head of the Muslim Council of Sweden.

Dhari told his neighbours that he was an employee at Stockholm mosque, a position he received via the Swedish Public Employment Service, though mosque leadership denied knowing who he was, since so many are sent to the mosque by both the Prison and Probation Service and the employment service. Dhari applied several times to be transferred to a prison nearer to Stockholm but authorities refused due to the risk of escape. *Sahbi Zalouti, 37, Tunisian origin, a Swedish national, was arrested in J√§rf√§lla, Sweden.

The Financial Times described Feldman as \\"David Cameron's oldest political friend\\" since their days together at Brasenose College, Oxford.David Cameron: the verdict so far, 8 March 2012, Financial Times, George Parker Feldman was responsible for fundraising David Cameron's successful Tory leadership campaign in 2005. He was created a life peer by David Cameron in 2010, and then Chairman of the Conservative Party, first as co-chairman alongside Sayeeda Warsi and then Grant Shapps between 2010 and 2015, then on his own as sole chairman from May 2015. His tenure ended after David Cameron's administration ended in July 2016. Early life and family He was born into a Jewish family in London, the eldest son of Malcolm R Feldman (b. 1939) and his wife Marcia J, n√©e Summers (b. 1944).\\"FELDMAN OF ELSTREE\\", Who's Who, online edition, 2013, A & C Black. Accessed 27 May 2013. His paternal grandmother was of Austrian descent. He married Gabrielle Gourgey in 1999; they have two sons and one daughter. They live in a townhouse in Holland Park, just round the corner from David Cameron's pre-Downing Street family home in Notting Hill. Feldman was educated at The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, an independent school in Elstree in Hertfordshire, followed by Brasenose College at the University of Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class degree in Jurisprudence. He went on to the Inns of Court School of Law. Whilst at Oxford, he played for the Brasenose College tennis team, where he became friends with Cameron and Guy Spier. Feldman and Cameron together helped organise the college's May Ball in their second year. Feldman was chairman of the Ball committee, while Cameron booked the entertainment. Feldman has since remained a close confidant of Cameron, who gave him his own office in Downing Street. Business career Feldman worked as a management consultant at Bain & Co before being called to the bar in 1991 and working as a commercial barrister at One Essex Court until 1995. He subsequently worked for the family fashion firm, Jayroma (London) Ltd, serving as Managing Director and later Chief Executive. He has donated to the Conservative Party through his company Jayroma the following amounts: ¬£8,500 in 2008, ¬£30,000 in 2009, ¬£17,200 in 2010, ¬£13,000 in 2011, ¬£8,690 in 2012.Lord Feldman faces new row over corporation tax. Conservative chairman in row over news his company Jayroma made large donations to party but paid no corporation tax. David Cameron leadership campaign With the encouragement and financial backing from Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham, Feldman ran the operations and fundraising for David Cameron's 2005 leadership bid for the Conservative party. Feldman himself gave ¬£10,000 to Cameron's campaign from his family clothing company Jayroma and secured tens of thousands more from other business backers. Chief Executive of the Conservative Party In July 2008 David Cameron promoted Feldman to Chief Executive of the Conservative Campaign Headquarters, a key role in preparing the Tories for the 2010 general election. In October 2008, Feldman was embroiled in the \\"Yachtgate\\" scandal with George Osborne. Both he and Shadow Chancellor Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht off Corfu when Osborne was accused of soliciting a ¬£50,000 donation to the party, which would have been a violation of the law against political donations by foreign citizens. This was when Feldman was Cameron's chief fundraiser. Both denied they had discussed soliciting donations from Deripaska, contrary to the claim made at the time by Nathaniel Philip Rothschild who organised the party event. In March 2016, Feldman was questioned by journalist Michael Crick about election expenses that may have broken the law. Chairman of the Conservative Party After the Conservatives entered government with the Liberal Democrats on 11 May 2010, Cameron appointed Feldman as the co-chairman of the party, with Sayeeda Warsi. His being given an office in Downing Street is a privilege never bestowed before on a party chairman. One of his jobs was to strengthen the voluntary party and increase membership. On 17 December 2010, Feldman was created a life peer as Baron Feldman of Elstree, of Elstree in the County of Hertfordshire;London Gazette no. 59641. p. 24505 he was introduced in the House of Lords, where he sits as a Conservative, on 20 December 2010. In 2012, Feldman helped Cameron prepare for the Leveson Inquiry by roleplaying the lead counsel of the inquiry Robert Jay QC. Feldman was severely criticised by one of his Conservative councillors, Catherine Faulks, for failing to vote for her in the 2011 by- election for the Norland ward in Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council. Feldman claimed at the time that he was prohibited from voting as a member of the House of Lords, although this was a misunderstanding. In May 2013, Feldman was widely attributed with making a claim that Conservative parliamentary rebellions on both a referendum on European Union membership and same sex marriage were due to Conservative Associations being \\"all mad, swivel-eyed loons\\", a claim that he has denied. The alleged words were claimed to have been said on the evening of Wednesday 15 May during a Conservative Friends of Pakistan event held in St James's, central London.

Named for the region of East Frisia, Ostfrieslands keel was laid in October 1908 at the Kaiserliche Werft dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. She was launched on 30 September 1909 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 August 1911. The ship was equipped with twelve guns in six twin turrets, and had a top speed of . Ostfriesland was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career, including World War I. Along with her three sister ships, , , and , Ostfriesland participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the North Sea against the British Grand Fleet. This included the Battle of Jutland on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. The ship also saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy. She was present during the unsuccessful first incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and were therefore spared the destruction of the fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.  Design  Line drawing of the Helgoland class The ship was long, had a beam of and a draft of , and displaced at full load. She was powered by three 4-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines with 15 boilers; each engine drove a four-bladed screw. The ship's engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Ostfriesland stored up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . After 1915 the boilers were modified to spray oil on the coal; the ship could carry up to of fuel oil. She had a crew of 42 officers and 1,071 enlisted men. Ostfriesland was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/50 guns in six twin gun turrets, with one turret fore, one aft, and two on each flank of the ship. The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 guns and fourteen SK L/45 guns. After 1914, two of the 8.8 cm guns were removed and replaced by 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns. Ostfriesland was also armed with six submerged torpedo tubes. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by the same thickness of KCA on the sides and faces, as well as the barbettes that supported the turrets. Ostfrieslands deck was thick.  Service history  Ostfriesland was ordered by the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) under the provisional name Ersatz Oldenburg, as a replacement for the old coastal defense ship . The contract for the ship was awarded to the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven under construction number 31. Work began on 19 October 1908 with the laying of her keel, and the ship was launched less than a year later, on 30 September 1909. She was christened by the Princess of Innhausen and Knyphausen, a representative of the oldest East Frisian nobility. Fitting-out, including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament, lasted until August 1911. Ostfriesland, named for the north-western coastal area of Germany, was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 August 1911, just under three years from when work commenced. After commissioning, Ostfriesland conducted sea trials, which were completed by 15 September. Kapit√§n zur See (KzS) Walter Engelhardt served as the ship's first commanding officer. On the 22nd, the ship was formally assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. She then conducted individual ship training exercises, which were followed by I Squadron, and then fleet maneuvers in November. Ostfriesland became the new squadron flagship on 24 April 1912, replacing . The annual summer cruise in July‚ÄìAugust, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic. Ostfriesland and the rest of the fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peacetime. Ostfriesland won the 1912/1913 Kaiserschiesspreis‚Äîthe Kaiser's artillery shooting prize‚Äîfor I Squadron. Kapit√§nleutnant Friedrich Beesel was the ship's gunnery officer at the time and, as such, was responsible for the accuracy of the ship's shooting. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skadenes before returning to port, where it remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July Ostfriesland and the rest of I Squadron was back in Wilhelmshaven. = World War I = The first major naval action in the North Sea, the Battle of Helgoland Bight, took place on 28 August 1914. At 04:30, Helgoland, which was stationed off the heavily fortified island of Wangerooge, received the order to join Ostfriesland and sail out of the harbor. At 05:00, the two battleships met the battered cruisers and . By 07:30, the ships had returned to port for the night. On the afternoon of 7 September, Ostfriesland and the rest of the High Seas Fleet conducted a training cruise to the island of Heligoland. In October, Ostfriesland was equipped with a pair of 8.8 cm flak guns for anti-air defense. alt=A large gray warship steams at full speed; thick black smoke pours from its three smoke stacks. Ostfriesland was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Ingenohl intended to use the battlecruisers of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding Ostfriesland and her three sisters‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany. The Battle of Dogger Bank, in which Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons ambushed the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group, occurred on 24 January 1915. Ostfriesland and the rest of I Squadron sortied to reinforce the outnumbered German battlecruisers; I Squadron left port at 12:33 CET, along with the pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron. They were too late, however, and failed to locate any British forces. By 19:05, the fleet had returned to the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven. In the meantime, the armored cruiser had been overwhelmed by concentrated British fire and sunk, while the battlecruiser was severely damaged by a fire in one of the ammunition magazines. As a result, Kaiser Wilhelm II removed Ingenohl from his post and replaced him with Admiral Hugo von Pohl on 2 February. Ostfriesland in 1915 with a zeppelin overhead The eight I Squadron ships went into the Baltic on 22 February 1915 for unit training, which lasted until 13 March. Following their return to the North Sea, the ships participated in a series of uneventful fleet sorties on 29‚Äì30 March, 17‚Äì18 April, 21‚Äì22 April, 17‚Äì18 May, and 29‚Äì30 May. Ostfriesland and the rest of the fleet remained in port until 4 August, when I Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of training maneuvers. That month, KzS Ernst-Oldwig von Natzmer replaced Engelhardt as the ship's commanding officer. From the Baltic, the squadron was attached to the naval force that attempted to sweep the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces in August 1915. The assault force included the eight I Squadron battleships, the battlecruisers , , and Seydlitz, several light cruisers, 32 destroyers and 13 minesweepers. The plan called for channels in Russian minefields to be swept so that the Russian naval presence, which included the pre-dreadnought battleship , could be eliminated. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the Gulf. Ostfriesland and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the Gulf for the entirety of the operation. The dreadnoughts and were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy Slava, though they failed to sink the old battleship. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the Gulf the following day. By 26 August, I Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven. On 23‚Äì24 October, the High Seas Fleet undertook its last major offensive operation under the command of Admiral Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. By January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened Pohl to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties, and he was replaced by Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5‚Äì7 March, followed by two more on 21‚Äì22 March and 25‚Äì26 March. During Scheer's next operation, Ostfriesland supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed but, during the approach to Yarmouth, encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted I Scouting Group to retreat. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.  Battle of Jutland  alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Ostfriesland was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland, which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Ostfriesland was the lead ship in I Squadron's I Division and the ninth ship in the line, directly astern of the fleet flagship and ahead of her sister Th√ºringen. I Squadron was the center of the German line, behind the eight K√∂nig- and Kaiser-class battleships of III Squadron. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions‚ÄîII Battle Squadron‚Äîformed the rear of the formation. Ostfriesland flew the flag of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Erhardt Schmidt, the squadron commander during the battle and Scheer's deputy commander. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, K√∂nig, spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers and, a minute later, the order to open fire was given. While the leading battleships engaged the British battlecruiser squadron, Ostfriesland and ten other battleships fired on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. Ostfriesland, , and Nassau engaged the cruiser , though only Nassau scored a hit. After about 15 minutes, Ostfriesland shifted fire to and , though again failed to hit her targets. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought came into range; Ostfriesland opened fire at 19:25 with her main battery guns, at ranges of . Ostfriesland claimed hits from her third and fourth salvos. Warspite was hit by a total of thirteen heavy shells during this period. By 20:15, the German battle line had faced the entire deployed Grand Fleet a second time. Scheer ordered a 180-degree turn at 20:17, which was covered by a charge by the battlecruiser squadron and a torpedo-boat attack. In order to hasten the maneuver, Schmidt ordered Ostfriesland to turn immediately without waiting for Th√ºringen behind him. This move caused some difficulty for the III Squadron ships ahead, though the ships quickly returned to their stations. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Ostfriesland was the eighth ship, stationed toward the front of the 24-ship line. An hour later, the leading units of the German line encountered British light forces and a violent firefight at close range ensued. Sometime around 01:10, the armored cruiser stumbled into the German line. Th√ºringen illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30.5 cm rounds into the ship. Ostfriesland fired with her 15 cm guns and Kaiser fired both 30.5 cm and 15 cm guns. In the span of less than a minute, two massive explosions tore the cruiser apart and killed the entire 857-man crew. Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1 June. At 06:20, however, Ostfriesland struck a mine, previously laid by the destroyer on 4 May, on her starboard side. The ship hauled out of line, as the explosion was initially thought to have been a torpedo fired by a submarine. Ostfriesland fell behind the fleet and steamed at slow speed, screened by the destroyers , , and briefly by . By 10:40, the battleship had increased speed to . Her anti-submarine escort was eventually reinforced by a floatplane, which spotted what it believed to be a British submarine at 12:20. Ostfriesland turned away, which caused the torpedo bulkhead, damaged slightly by the mine explosion, to tear open. More water entered the ship and caused a 4.75 degree list to starboard, forcing Ostfriesland to reduce speed again. The ship requested assistance from a pumping ship at 14:20, but by 14:45 the flooding was under control and the ship passed the Outer Jade Lightship. She was able to increase speed gradually to , and at 18:15 she reached port in Wilhelmshaven. The mine tore a hole that measured and allowed of water into the ship. Further flooding occurred after the torpedo bulkhead damage at 12:20, though the full damage report has not survived. Ostfriesland was drydocked in Wilhelmshaven for repairs, which lasted until 26 July. In the course of the battle, Ostfriesland fired 111 rounds from her main battery, 101 shells from her 15 cm guns, and a single 8.8 cm shell. The only damage sustained was the mine that was struck on the morning of 1 June, which killed one man and wounded ten.  Later operations  On 18 August 1916, Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation. The two serviceable German battlecruisers, Moltke and Von der Tann, supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Ostfriesland, would trail behind and provide cover. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. On 25‚Äì26 September, Ostfriesland and the rest of I Squadron provided support for a sweep out to the Terschelling Bank conducted by the II F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote (Leader of Torpedo Boats). Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18‚Äì20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank. For the majority of 1917, Ostfriesland was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, Ostfriesland and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on the 29th. On 2 November the operation was completed and Ostfriesland and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. In March 1918, Natzmer was replaced as the ship's commander by KzS Hans Herr. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23‚Äì24 April 1918. Ostfriesland, Th√ºringen, and Nassau were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlu√üstein, a planned occupation of St. Petersburg. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd. = The end of the war = Ostfriesland and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, just over 2 weeks before the Armistice was signed. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Gro√üadmiral (Grand Admiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war- weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of the 29th, sailors on Th√ºringen and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy\\". On 16 December, Ostfriesland was decommissioned and used as a barracks ship. Ostfriesland under United States flag Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Only the most modern ships were sent for internment; the four Helgoland-class ships were left in Germany. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships. In the span of a few hours, ten battleships and five battlecruisers sank in the shallow waters of Scapa Flow. KzS Karl Windm√ºller served as Ostfrieslands final commander, until she was stricken from the navy list on 5 November 1919. She was then surrendered to the Allies as \\"H\\" as a replacement for the ships that had been scuttled. The ship remained in Germany until 7 April 1920, when a German crew took her to Rosyth. She was ceded to the United States as war reparations, and on 9 April an American crew arrived to bring her to the US. =US bombing target= In July 1921, the Army Air Service and the US Navy conducted a series of bombing tests off Cape Henry, led by General Billy Mitchell. The targets included demobilized American and former German warships, including the old battleship , the cruiser , and finally Ostfriesland on 20 July. At 13:30 ET, the first attack wave, armed with bombs, struck the stationary ship. Eight of thirty-three bombs found their mark, after which the ship was inspected. The second wave was also armed with 230 lb bombs, and the third and fourth carried bombs. Five 600 lb bombs found their mark, but little damage was done to the ship's topside. The bombs that nearly missed the ship, however, had done significant underwater damage to the hull, which allowed some flooding and created a list of five degrees to port and three additional feet of draft at the stern. The bombing schedule was interrupted by a storm in the late afternoon. Early on the morning of 21 July, the fifth wave of bombers began their attack. At 08:52, the first Army bomber dropped a bomb that hit the ship; four more bombers followed and scored two further hits. Inspectors again went aboard Ostfriesland following the fifth attack and noted that the hits had not seriously damaged the ship, though one had created a large hole on her starboard side that allowed further flooding. By noon, she was down five feet at the stern and one foot at the bow. At 12:19, the next attack wave, equipped with bombs, struck. Six bombs were dropped, none of which hit, though three detonated very close to the hull. At 12:30, Ostfriesland began to sink rapidly by the stern and the list to port increased dramatically. At 12:40, the ship rolled over and sank. The results of the tests were widely publicized and Mitchell became both a national hero and the \\"infallible prophet of aviation\\". The leadership of the US Navy, however, was outraged by Mitchell's handling of the tests; the 2,000 lb bombs had not been sanctioned by the Navy, which had set the rules for the engagement. Mitchell's bombers had also not allowed inspectors aboard the ship between bombing runs as stipulated by the Navy. The joint Army‚ÄìNavy report on the tests, issued a month later and signed by General John Pershing, stated that \\"the battleship is still the backbone of the fleet.\\" Mitchell wrote his own, contradictory account of the tests, which was then leaked to the press. The sinking of the battleship sparked great controversy in the American public sphere; Mitchell's supporters exaggerated the significance of the tests by falsely claiming Ostfriesland to be an unsinkable \\"super-battleship\\" and that \\"old sea dogs ... wept aloud.\\" Senator William Borah argued that the tests had rendered battleships obsolete. Mitchell was widely supported in the press, though his increasingly combative tactics eventually resulted in a court- martial for insubordination that forced him to retire from the military.

They have since been found to describe systems in non- linear optics, fluid mechanics and the theory of non-linear dynamical systems, as they provide a pair of invariants or conserved quantities for the three- wave equation. For example, in a resonant interaction in non-linear optics, the Manley‚ÄìRowe relations can be interpreted as saying one photon is created as two more are destroyed (or conversely, two are created when one is destroyed.) For the three-wave equation, the Manley‚ÄìRowe invariants can be related to the modular invariants g_2 and g_3 of the Weierstrass ‚Ñò-function. Ruth Ann Martin and Harvey Segur (2016) Toward a General Solution of the Three-Wave Resonant Interaction Equations, Studies in Applied Mathematics, Volume 137, Issue 1. This essentially follows because the three-wave interaction has exact solutions that are given by elliptic functions.  History  The original papers, written by two researchers at Bell Labs, J. M.

One or more oscillators, operating at specified frequencies, are connected to the input of this circuit. The Manley‚ÄìRowe relations predict the energy present in waves at various frequencies, including new frequencies (such as harmonics and sidebands) that arise in the circuit due to nonlinearity. The theory is based partly on the principle of conservation of energy. It requires that energy storage in the circuit is a stationary process that varies with time only due to the oscillations and not due to some steady increase or decrease with time. More precisely, the theory describes a resonant interaction between waves at various different frequencies; the resonant interaction describes which frequencies can mix and interact, and the strengths by which they couple. Because the Manley‚ÄìRowe relations are based on general concepts like nonlinear waves and conservation of energy, their use is not limited to the original application in radio-frequency electrical circuits. They have also found use in other scientific fields, for example nonlinear optics. In the electrical circuit for the original derivation of Manley‚ÄìRowe relations, capacitors and inductors store energy from a wave and then release it. Other physical systems that involve energy storage for waves, and nonlinear generation of new waves, can make use of the same relations. John Manley and Harrison Rowe were prot√©g√©s of Ralph Hartley at Bell Laboratories. The work with nonlinear reactances (inductors and capacitors) was started back in 1917 by John Burton and Eugene Peterson.Peterson E., ‚ÄúAtomic Physics and Circuit Theory‚Äù; Bell Laboratories Record, Volume 7, February 1929, pp 231‚Äì233 When Hartley joined Bell Laboratories after being part of Western Electric, he started a research group on nonlinear oscillations.

He was an early proponent of the use of radiography in orthopaedics, and described the eponymous Jones fracture.  Life and work  Robert Jones was born in Llandudno, North Wales, and was brought up in London. His father gave up his career as an architect to take up writing, so his family became quite poor. At the age of 16 he left London to live with his uncle, Hugh Owen Thomas, in Liverpool. He learned about fracture care and the manufacture of braces from his uncle, and attended the Liverpool School of Medicine from 1873 to 1878. He continued to work with his uncle, and was subsequently appointed Honorary Assistant Surgeon to the Stanley Hospital in Liverpool in 1887.Sir Robert Jones: a Brief Biography at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust website. At this time, Jones and his uncle were among the few surgeons interested in the treatment of fractures, while the majority of orthopaedic surgery was aimed at correcting deformity in children and was carried out by general surgeons. He received his FRCS in 1889. =Manchester Ship Canal= In 1888 he was appointed Surgeon-Superintendent for the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, responsible for the injured among the 20,000 workers during the seven- year project. He organised the first comprehensive accident service in the world, dividing the 36-mile site into 3 sections, and establishing a hospital and a string of first aid posts in each section. He staffed the hospitals with medical personnel trained in fracture management. The hospitals were linked by a railway which ran the length of the canal, and Sir Robert could be contacted in Liverpool by telegraphy if his presence was required. He personally managed 3,000 cases and performed 300 operations in his own hospital. This position enabled him to learn new techniques and improve the standard of fracture management. =Organisation of orthopaedic surgeons= On 3 November 1894, Robert Jones and Alfred Tubby convened a group of surgeons at the Holborn Restaurant in London to found the British Orthopaedic Society. The society had 31 members, most of whom were still general surgeons with an interest in orthopaedics; this lack of committed orthopaedic surgeons is likely to have been the reason that the society disbanded after 4 years. In 1913 Jones served as the President of the orthopaedic section of the International Medical Congress held in London. The subsequent congress was to be held in Munich three years later. = Radiography = Wilhelm R√∂ntgen announced the discovery of X-rays on 28 December 1895. This discovery was published in the Frankfurter Zeitung newspaper which was translated for Robert Jones by Mrs. Wimpfheimer, a volunteer in his Sunday clinic in Liverpool. On 7 February 1896, Jones and Oliver Lodge took a radiograph of the wrist of a 12-year-old boy to locate a bullet that could not be found by probing. The X-ray required a 2-hour exposure, but successfully demonstrated the bullet lodged in the third carpometacarpal joint. This case was published in The Lancet in February 1896, the first published clinical radiograph. Jones continued to value the use of X-rays in his practice. In a paper published a few months before he died, he remarked: > Radiography here, as in all branches of medicine, is an essential aid to > diagnosis. No matter how experienced we may be, we cannot afford to dispense > with it, even in the apparently simple and obvious case. Not only should we > insist upon procuring a film, but it is equally important that we should > welcome the radiologist's reading of it. Some surgeons resent this and say, > \\"Give me the film so that I can read it for myself,\\" but this is an arrogant > and stupid attitude, and not to the patient's advantage. = The Jones fracture = Robert Jones described the fracture of the fifth metatarsal which bears his name in the Annals of Surgery in 1902. In his paper, Jones describes the fracture in a series of 6 patients, the first of which was himself. He had injured his foot while dancing several months earlier, and had thought the injury to be to a tendon in the foot. He examined himself the day after the injury, and found that the tendon was intact, but he could not find definite evidence of bony injury. He asked a colleague, Dr. David Morgan, to X-ray his foot, and a fracture above the base of the fifth metatarsal was found. The finding of similar fractures in several patients after his own prompted him to write about it. He also noted that the fracture was not caused by direct trauma to the bone, as had always been written before, but by a cross-strain being applied to the bone. = First World War = At the outbreak of the First World War Jones was mobilised as a Territorial Army surgeon in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He observed that treatment of fractures both at the front and in hospitals at home was inadequate, and his efforts led to the introduction of military orthopaedic hospitals. He was appointed Inspector of Military Orthopaedics, with responsibility over 30,000 beds. The hospital in Ducane Road, Hammersmith became the model for both British and American military orthopaedic hospitals. His advocacy of the use of Thomas splint for the initial treatment of femoral fractures resulted in a dramatic reduction in morbidity and mortality from this injury. Jones was promoted several times for his war service, ending his military career as a major general.Welsh Biography Online (accessed 14 May 2011) Jones died, aged 75, in Bodynfoel, near Llanfechain. Personal life Jones married in 1887 Susie, daughter of William Evans of Liverpool, with whom he had one son and one daughter. She died in 1918. Honours Jones was the recipient of many honours from surgical institutions and societies at home and abroad and received honorary degrees from six universities, of which the D.Sc. from the University of Wales (1917) was one. The universal tribute to him as an orthopaedic surgeon was revealed by his election as first president of the International Society of Orthopaedic Surgery. He was made KBE in 1919, a Knight Bachelor and CB in 1917, and a baronet. In 1920, Jones was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. He also held the TD, was a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, and was awarded the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal in 1919. After his death, his ashes were laid to rest in Liverpool Cathedral. His son, Arthur Probyn Jones, succeeded to his baronetcy. Harry Platt was among the orthopaedic surgeons to have been very influenced by the work of Jones. The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital is named after him. The hospital was originally established in Baschurch, Shropshire by Miss Agnes Hunt as the Baschurch Children's Hospital in 1900. Agnes Hunt had consulted Jones about an illness of her own in 1903 and he became honorary surgeon to the hospital in 1904. The hospital moved its present site in Oswestry as the Shropshire Orthopaedic Hospital in 1921 and became the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in 1933. A statue of Sir Robert was unveiled at the opening of the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre by the Duke of Cambridge in June 2018.  References  Further reading * F.

The play is set in New Orleans in 1801 as the United States is attempting to purchase Louisiana from France, as well as some scenes taking place in Haiti and France. The story follows main character Jacques Cornet, \\"a new world Don Juan\\" and the wealthiest colored man in New Orleans.\\"A Free Man of Color\\" broadway.com Cornet gains all of his money from his father who is a wealthy plantation owner. With extreme wealth comes a lot of responsibility in which Cornet is not quite ready for. Cornet spends his time searching for maps of the New World and sleeping with women all over the city who find Cornet's money very attractive. During the time of the play New Orleans lacked any true law and order and the city is a parade of young men and women. Guare directs the play through the actions of Cornet as he is able to meet with characters Thomas Jefferson and Napoleon Bonaparte throughout the play. By showing these confrontations the reader is able to learn about significant historical data such as the Yellow Fever, Napoleonic tactics, and the slave rebellion that nearly took over Santo Domingo's government.

Some of the themes noted include immorality which is demonstrated through Cornet's lack of empathy toward individuals after obtaining a large sum of money and becoming one of the most influential figures in New Orleans. Cornet establishes his morality when he stages a shooting in order to gain the respect back from the men in New Orleans who have recently turned against him. Along with this sense of immorality is the corruption seen by characters during the play. Corruption is rooted throughout the play, most notably by Jacques Cornet who uses his money to obtain favors from individuals. Guare also develops the theme of race during the whole of the play in that Jacques Cornet loses everything after the battles of slavery come back into play in New Orleans after the country doubles its size due to the Louisiana Purchase.  Response  The Wall Street Journal's Terry Teachout wrote in his review, \\"If neatness is what you expect from John Guare's \\"A Free Man of Color,\\" you'll be doomed to disappointment.

Though he had been active behind the scene surveying, organizing and supporting the nationalist cause, ever since his return to India, especially during his excursions to Bengal. This period of his activity from 1906-1910 saw a complete transformation of India's political scene. Before Aurobindo began publishing his views, the Congress was an annual debating society whose rare victories had been instances of the empire taking a favourable view to its petitions. By the time Aurobindo left the field, the ideal of political independence had been firmly ingrained into the minds of people, and nineteen years later, it became the official raison d'√™tre of the Congress.Peter Heehs. Idea of India This change was affected by the advent of the aggressive nationalist thought of Lokmanya Tilak who declared that swaraj was his birthright and Bipin Chandra Pal who demanded \\"complete autonomy\\" from Britain. However none went as far as Aurobindo in articulating the legitimacy and necessity of complete independence. He \\"based his claim for freedom for India on the inherent right to freedom, not on any charge of misgovernment or oppression\\". He wrote :  Beginnings  Sri Aurobindo had become contemptuous of the British rule in India since his days as a student in England. While at the beginning of Sri Aurobindo's educational career, his father had been a believer in the superiority of the British People, by the time Sri Aurobindo was nearing the end of his education in England, Dr. Ghose started mailing Aurobindo newspaper clips of atrocities unleashed by the British on the Indian people. While at King's college, Aurobindo was drawn to Irish nationalists such as Charles Stewart Parnell. He wrote, in praise of Parnell : This personification of the subjugated nation as the Mother in chains, was a recurring theme in Aurobindo's writings and would later come to galvanize a generation of Indian revolutionaries. From his observations of the British Politics, Aurobindo became convinced that India had little hope from the British Parliament. While in London he joined up with a society of revolutionaries called \\"Lotus and Dagger\\" who were committed to overthrowing the British. His activities in England though, were inconsequential. After his return to India, he started working to bring about a revolutionary change in the political situation in India. He came to believe that the only way to free India from the British yoke was that the common people and not just the elite that composed the erstwhile Congress, should embark upon a total revolution. Aurobindo espoused a threefold approach to this end : # To conduct secret revolutionary propaganda and develop organizations to prepare for an armed revolution. # To spread the idea of revolution and prepare the entire nation for independence. # To organise the people for non-cooperation and passive resistance against foreign rule.Banglapedia http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ghosh,_Aurobindo  Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar Party  At the beginning of 20th century Bengal had become the central hub for voices against the British Rule and during his vacations to meet his family in Bengal, Aurobindo came in contact with many who shared his views. Aurobindo became inspired by the story of Bankim's novel Anandamath. Aurobindo frequently shared with his younger brother Barin his ideas of imparting martial and intellectual training to the youth of Bengal for the coming revolution; loosely like the sannyais of Anandamath who stir a rebellion against the British. This concept is rooted in Shakta philosophy. Anushilan Samiti was founded as an attempt to organize Bengali youth through a program of physical fitness and spiritual training for a nationalist program. By 1902, Calcutta had three societies working under the umbrella of Anushilan Samity, a society earlier founded by a Calcutta barrister by the name of Pramatha Mitra. These included Mitra's own group, another led by a Bengali lady by the name of Sarala Devi, and a third one led by Aurobindo Ghosh. The Anushilan Samiti had Aurobindo and Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das as the vice- presidents, Suren Tagore the treasurer. Jatindra Nath Banerjee (Niralamba Swami), Bagha Jatin, Bhupendra Nath Datta (Swami Vivekananda's brother), Barindra Ghosh were among other initial leaders. By 1905, the work of Aurobindo and his brother Barin Ghosh allowed Anushilan Samity to spread through Bengal.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Anushilan_Samiti When the first Partition of Bengal was announced in 1905, Aurobindo took an extended leave from the college in Baroda and dedicated himself to participate in anti-British activities in Bengal. Barin who was an aggressive revolutionary in his own right prodded Aurobindo to write about a plan for a Monks' rebellion. In August 1905 Aurobindo published a blueprint for such a training facility called \\"Bhawani Mandir\\" (or Bhawani's temple).http://aurobindo.ru/workings/sa/01/0012_e.htm This plan and its logistics were later taken over by Barin when Aurobindo devoted himself to the mainstream of Politics. Aurobindo provided the ideological foundation to the ultra-radical Jugantar party, as an offshoot of the Anushilan Samiti. The party was founded by Barin and Bhupendra Nath Dutta. Among the operational aims of this society was to sensitize and stimulate the disaffected youth of Bengal to the nationalist cause.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Jugantar_Party  Bande Mataram  The views of Tilak, Aurobindo and other aggressive nationalists, being radically different from those of the moderates, created fissures in the Congress and the debate for its future direction and control spilled into the public domain. To take the extremists' view to the public, Bipin Chandra Pal had founded the nationalist Bengali newspaper Bande Mataram (written Vande Maataram while being pronounced B√¥nde Mat√¥rom in the Bengali language in the Bangla way, although the original words are Sanskrt and are pronounced Vande Maataram in most other Indian languages including Sanskrt). Pal invited Aurobindo to become its editor along with Pal. Pal after a few issues discontinued contributing to the paper. The paper rapidly became a major success.http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/research/show.php?set=doclife&id;=9 and the radical views finally found a popular voice. But as a result of its popularity and open espousal of aggressive methods, the paper came into frequent confrontation with the Raj. In 1907 the British Government decided to prosecute the group behind Bande Mataram, for its constant propaganda against British rule. Notices were served for using language which was a \\"direct incentive to violence and lawlessness.\\" http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/research/show.php?set=doclife&id;=10 On 16 August, Aurobindo was sought for arrested by the Police. Aurobindo courted arrest and was released on monetary sureties. The sensational act and the events surrounding the arrest were seen as an episode of defiance against the empire and turned him into a national celebrity. Provincial and National press showered lavish praise on Aurobindo.Tagore wrote: \\"Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee! O friend, my country's friend, O Voice incarnate, free, Of India's soul....The fiery messenger that with the lamp of God hath come...Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee\\".Peter Heehs. The Lives of Sri Aurobindo. 127 The prosecution was unable to establish that Sri Aurobindo was the editor of the paper and he was acquitted. Pal was sentenced to six months in prison for declining to depose. After the Bande Mataram Case, Sri Aurobindo became the recognised leader of aggressive nationalism in Bengal.Orrissa Review., 2005  National education  Aurobindo was a strong proponent of an indigenous system of national education. His experiences at Baroda university had convinced him about the shortcomings of the education system of the time. His views on national education frequently brought him in conflict with the moderates of Congress. When the Risley Circular banned the study or mention of politics from government aided educational institutes, Aurobindo along with others saw this as a direct challenge to his program of youth nationalism. He campaigned extensively to gain self-reliance on the front of education, writing articles about the circular and its implications. He, along with Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick and Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury decided that they would protest the partition of Bengal by setting up an institution that would challenge British rule by offering education to the masses \\"on national lines and under national control\\". The Bengal National College was set up with Aurobindo as its first principal. Later, when he founded the newspaper Karmayogin, he expounded in detail his philosophy on education in the series titled A System of National Education.  Alipore bomb case  The British had been keeping tabs on activities of Barin and Aurobindo since the Bande Mataram episode. On 30 April 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki, members of Barin's group, attempted to bomb Magistrate Kingsford's carriage in Alipore. They failed to discern between the identical carriages of the party and the bombs instead landed in the wrong carriage, killing two British women, the wife and daughter of another barrister. The British reaction was swift, with 33 suspects being rounded up within the next two days. Barin and Aurobindo were also arrested and put into prison. The ensuing trial lasted for a year. Aurobindo was acquitted. Khudiram Bose was found guilty and later hanged. Barin was sentenced to death, but this sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment (He was released in 1920). Aurobindo came out of prison and delivered the famous Uttarpara Speech.http://intyoga.online.fr/uttaspch.htm A few months after the end of his incarceration, and few other anti-British activities, Aurobindo retired from active politics and sailed to Pondicherry, where he would spend the rest of his life.

The term was coined by Robert P. Bolande in 1974. After the induction of the neural crest, the newly formed neural crest cells (NCC) delaminate from their tissue of origin and migrate from the entire neural axis of the vertebrate embryo to specific locations where they will give rise to different cell derivatives. The formation of this cell population therefore requires a timely and spatially controlled interplay of inter- and intra-cellular signals. An alteration in the occurrence and timing of these signals leads to a set of syndromes called Neurocristopathies (NCP), which comprises a broad spectrum of congenital malformations affecting an appreciable percentage of newborns. Moreover, since NCC migrate along the embryo, they are susceptible to subtle changes in the environment both during their migration and upon arrival at their destination. This means that even little modifications, either genetically or environmentally caused ,in the external cues that modulate NCC migration have a deep effect on the normal migration and differentiation of these cells, thus becoming a causative factor for the development of NCP. Recently, a new classification for this group of diseases has been proposed. This new criteria takes into account the axial origin of the NC population that contributes to the derived tissue affected in a particular NCP. According to this, some diseases have a single axial origin, i.e, they arise from an alteration in the development of only one NC population (e.g cranial NCP, such as Auriculo Condylar Syndrome). However, other NCP arise from a defect in two or more NC populations (such as the CHARGE syndrome). Accepted examples of NCP are piebaldism, Waardenburg syndrome, Hirschsprung disease, Ondine's curse (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome), pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, Merkel cell carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia, neurofibromatosis type I, CHARGE syndrome, familial dysautonomia, DiGeorge syndrome, Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome (a.k.a. hemifacial microsomia), craniofrontonasal syndrome, congenital melanocytic nevus, melanoma, and certain congenital heart defects of the outflow tract. Recently, many diseases have been incorporated as NCP, mainly based on the finding of new NC derivatives. In particular, Multiple sclerosis has been suggested as being neurocristopathic in origin. The usefulness of the definition resides in its ability to refer to a potentially common etiological factor for certain neoplasms and/or congenital malformation associations that are otherwise difficult to group with other means of nosology. Moreover, the classification of NCP is intended to help physicians understand the causal mechanism that drives the formation of a certain NCP, and therefore the selection of the correct diagnostic test and therapies.

Following Stacy Maluga, Scully is eventually lead to Derek Slater, another rap artist whom Stacy is attempting to turn against her husband by exercising an escape clause in his contract, and Bust-A-Cap, a well dressed, well educated, eloquent gentleman outside of his rap artist persona. After preventing their murder at Bust-a-Cap's latest concert performance, Scully eventually winds up in Vegas, and is captured along with Derek and Bust-A-Cap, and led out into the desert to be executed. Once there, Scully notices there are three dug graves, which is unusual as only Derek and Bust-A-Cap were targeted for murder and Scully was not expected to be in Las Vegas, let alone captured. As they stand around the graves, Scully idly asks Lou Maluga when he is planning on marrying his mistress and divorcing his wife. Extremely confused by the question, Lou Maluga allows Scully, over Stacy's shrieked objections, that Stacy can't allow Lou to divorce her, as the court costs and division of property would ruin the rap label she's struggled to maintain despite her husband's repeated violent episodes and his bungled business practices. After pointing out the number of graves, and explaining how the third one was originally meant for Lou, a violent shootout occurs. Lou Maluga and a few of his bodyguards are killed. Stacy, after confronting Scully and explaining how this doesn't affect her plans, is shot by her bodyguard \\"Insane Wayne,\\" an undercover California Sheriff's officer. After collecting all the survivors, several quickly confess that they hijacked Alexa and her car, picked up the undercover officer, and executed him with Alexa's weapon, before forcing her to confess to his murder and shooting her in the head. Finding a fire alarm going off in the basement, Scully heads down there to find John Bodine, whom Scully had befriended after a fashion, performing an African tribal dance around Alexa's body. Believing her to have died after being taken off life support, Scully and the doctors are shocked when she spontaneously revives, and slowly begins to recuperate.

He is best known for his work on the sci-fi horror cult film Cube (1997), and most recently his collaboration with director Robert Eggers on the period horror films The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019). Life and career During his early life in Winnipeg, Korven performed in many amateur rock bands, mostly playing the guitar in local bars. In 1977, he started taking formal music education at the Grant MacEwan Community College in Edmonton where he studied jazz and orchestration. After graduating, he developed into a singer / songwriter and recorded his first album of left-of-center pop entitled \\"Passengers\\". In 1987 he moved to Toronto, where he recorded the album \\"Ordinary Man\\" with Duke Street Records, and that same year he had his first chance at composing, with the score for Patricia Rozema's debut feature I've Heard the Mermaids Singing. which went on to win the La Prix de la Jeunesse at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1992 he released one more album \\"This Must Be The Place\\", although by that time his main activity had become composing scores for film and TV works. During his life Korven became specialized in world music, learning to play several exotic instruments, such as the Sarangi, the Nyckelharpa, the Duduk, the Erhu, and the water phone among others. He was also responsible for the creation of \\"The Apprehension Engine\\", a custom made musical instrument intended for the creation of unsettling noises to be used on scoring horror films. Its creation was commissioned to guitar manufacturer Tony Duggan-Smith. The instrument has been presented in a number of live presentations and is expected to be made available for purchase in a limited run. Also, a second version of it is in the works.

Its administrative center is the rural locality (a selo) of Leshukonskoye. District's population: The population of Leshukonskoye accounts for 55.2% of the district's population. History The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. First Russian settlements on the Mezen River were mentioned in the 16th century: Yuroma (1513) and Koynas (1554). The middle course of the Mezen, the current area of the district, was where Russian and Komi cultures mixed the most. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. In 1796, the area was transferred to Arkhangelsk Governorate. The current territory of the district was included into Mezensky Uyezd. On December 28, 1917, a new Ust-Vashsky Uyezd with the administrative center in Ust-Vashka (currently Leshukonskoye) was established; however, in 1925 it was merged back into Mezensky Uyezd. In 1929, several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, and Leshukonsky District was established. It became a part of Arkhangelsk Okrug of Northern Krai. In the following years, the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Leshukonsky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since. Geography The district lies almost entirely in the basin of the Mezen River, which crosses the district from southeast to northwest, and of its major tributaries, the Mezenskaya Pizhma, the Sula, the Kyma, the Vashka, the Kimzha, and, in the northern part, the Pyoza. Minor areas in the west of the district lie in the basin of the Yezhuga River, a tributary of the Pinega, and into the Nemnyuga River, a tributary of the Kuloy. Some areas in the east of the district are in the basin of the major tributaries of the Pechora, the Tsilma, and the Pizhma. In particular, the source of the Tsilma River is located in the district. The divide between the White Sea (the Mezen) and the Barents Sea (the Pechora) runs thus through the eastern part of the district. The northern part of the Timan Ridge lies in the district, creating the hilly landscape. Almost the whole of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga). There are many glacial lakes across the district. Divisions =Administrative divisions= Administratively, the district is divided into seven selsoviets. The following selsoviets have been established (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Leshukonsky (Leshukonskoye) *Nisogorsky (Zaruchey) *Olemsky (Olema) *Suksky (Koynas) *Tsenogorsky (Tsenogora) *Vozhgorsky (Vozhgora) *Yuromsky (Yuroma) =Municipal divisions= Municipally, the district is divided into six rural settlements (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Koynasskoye Rural Settlement (Koynas) *Leshukonskoye Rural Settlement (Leshukonskoye) *Olemskoye Rural Settlement (Olema) *Tsenogorskoye Rural Settlement (Tsenogora) *Vozhgorskoye Rural Settlement (Vozhgora) *Yuromskoye Rural Settlement (Yuroma) Economy =Industry= The backbone of the district's economy is the timber industry. However, although the district has the best timber resources in the area, poor infrastructure impedes the expansion of this industry. =Agriculture= The special breed of horses, Mezen horse, was bred in the Mezen River valley. The Mezen horses are rather small but suitable for difficult work and easily survive cold winters. =Transportation= The Mezen and the Vashka Rivers are both navigable within the district limits; however, there is no passenger navigation in Leshukonsky District except for the ferry crossing between Leshukonskoye and the village of Smolenets. The ferry connects to the all-seasonal road to Arkhangelsk. Until 2008, there were no all-seasonal roads in the district. During winter, temporary roads (zimniks) are built in snow; in summer, the air transport is the only means for passenger connections to Arkhangelsk and the rest of the world. There is an airport in Leshukonskoye, with several weekly flights to Arkhangelsk. There are also three minor airports in Koynas, Olema, and Vozhgora. Demographics In terms of population, the largest inhabited localities are Vozhgora and Leshukonskoye. The unemployment rate in October 2010 was 5.4%. Politics The local representative body is the Assembly of Deputies of Leshukonsky District. It has seventeen elected members. Its chairperson is Tatyana Stukalova. The head of the municipal administration is Alexander Martynov. Culture and recreation The district contains three objects classified as cultural and historical heritage by the Russian Federal law, and additionally thirty-nine objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance. Most of these are wooden churches and wooden rural houses built prior to 1917. The objects under federal protection are the St. Nicholas Church (1890), the Klokotov House (1879), and the wooden cross, all in the village of Zaozerye (also known as Kelchemgora). The Klokotov House was moved in 2004 to the Malye Korely open-air museum close to Arkhangelsk. The cross is also located in the same museum. The only state museum in the district is the Leshukonsky Museum, located in the selo of Leshukonskoye.

Serving under Chen, he defeated the rebels Qian Neng (Èò°ËÉΩ), Han Xiusheng (ÈüìÁßÄÂçá), and Qu Xingcong (Â±àË°åÂæû), as well as Chen's rival Yang Shili the military governor of Dongchuan (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), after which Chen made him the military governor of Dongchuan. By 886, however, Chen, who had become suspicious of his intentions, attacked him and killed him.  Background  Gao Renhou's origins had been lost to history even by the time that the New Book of Tang, which contained a biography of his, was written. However, it is known that he started his career as an officer under Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan, and that he became a commander of 2,000 of the 5,000 elite soldiers of Xichuan known as \\"Crow Corps,\\" after the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao had captured the imperial capital Chang'an, forcing then-reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Xichuan's capital Chengdu. As part of Chen's operations to prevent Huang from pursuing Emperor Xizong, he sent the Crow Corps north. At that time, many of the hoodlums of Chang'an had also fled Chang'an in light of Huang's attack and had greatly disturbed the lives of the people of the Baoji region. Gao attacked the hoodlums and killed thousands of them, thus pacifying the region.New Book of Tang, vol. 189.  Campaign against Qian Neng  By 882, there were a number of agrarian rebellions against Chen Jingxuan's governance of Xichuan, with one of the most serious rebellions led by Qian Neng, who was formerly a local administrator who was set for punished for minor errors and thus rose in rebellion. Chen initially sent his officers Yang Xingqian (Ê•äË°åÈÅ∑), Hu Hongl√ºe (ËÉ°Ê¥™Áï•), and Mo Kuangshi (Ëé´Âå°ÊôÇ) against these rebels,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. but they were largely ineffective; worse, to avoid being punished themselves, they often killed innocent civilians and claimed that the dead civilians were agrarian rebels. As a result, Qian was not only able to take over Qiong Prefecture where he initially started his rebellion, but advanced into Shu Prefecture (ËúÄÂ∑û, in modern Chengdu as well). In winter 882, Chen decided to send Gao Renhou to replace Yang and to attack Qian.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Instead of repeating Yang's failed strategy of intense attacks on the rebels, Gao persuaded a spy that Qian had sent to spy on his troops to instead turn against Qian and persuade Qian's followers that Gao had no ill intent toward them and only wanted them to abandon their support of Qian. Gao then engaged Qian's lieutenant Luo Hunqing (ÁæÖÊ∏æÊìé) at Shuangliu (ÈõôÊµÅ, in modern Chengdu). The rebels under Luo, having been persuaded by the spy, surrendered in droves, and Gao captured Luo. He then had the surrendered rebels serve as his forward troops (to show that Gao was, indeed, not mistreating them) and further attacked Qian's lieutenants Ju Huseng (Âè•ËÉ°ÂÉß) and Han Qiu (ÈüìÊ±Ç); Ju was captured, and Han committed suicide. Gao then allowed the surrendered rebels to return to their homes safely, further causing the morale of Qian's followers to fail. Qian's remaining followers arrested him; his lieutenant Luo Fuzi (ÁæÖÂ§´Â≠ê) committed suicide. Gao, pursuant to his own promise, only had Qian, Luo Hunqing, and Ju, as well as Qian's propagandist Zhang Rong (ÂºµÊ¶Æ), executed, and killed no one else. Because of Gao's accomplishments against Qian, Chen made him the defender (Èò≤Á¶¶‰Ωø, Fangyushi) of Mei Prefecture (ÁúâÂ∑û, in modern Meishan, Sichuan).  Campaign against Han Xiusheng and Qu Xingcong  Meanwhile, Chen Jingxuan had had to deal with another agrarian rebellion, led by Han Xiusheng and Qu Xingcong, that began in summer 882 in the Three Gorges region. Chen sent the officer Zhuang Mengdie (ËéäÂ§¢Ëù∂) against Han and Qu, but Zhuang was defeated by them and had to withdraw to Zhong Prefecture (Âø†Â∑û, in modern Chongqing). As a result, tributes from the circuits in the Yangtze River-Huai River region to the east were all cut off, causing Emperor Xizong's imperial government in exile to run out of funds and the salt supply for the people to run low. In spring 883, Chen sent Gao Renhou to attack Han and Qu instead, promising to have him made the military governor of Dongchuan if he succeeded. Instead of directly attacking Han and Qu immediately, Gao chose soldiers in his army who were good swimmers to scuttle Han and Qu's ships and sent raiders to burn Han and Qu's camps. Only after this did he attack. When Han's and Qu's followers began to surrender, they tried to counterattack by attacking the followers with swords; the angry followers instead captured them and surrendered them to Gao. When Gao interrogated them as to why they rebelled, he was impressed by their bold responses (blaming Tang misrule that started after the death of Emperor Xizong's well-regarded grandfather Emperor XuƒÅnzong) and gave them good food, but still delivered them to Chengdu, where they were executed.  Campaign against Yang Shili  When news of Chen Jingxuan's promise of having Gao Renhou made the military governor of Dongchuan reached Yang Shili the military governor of Dongchuan, however, Yang, who was previously Chen's ally but who had grown resentful of Chen over Chen's monopoly of the emperor's favors (due to Chen's brother Tian Lingzi's domination of the emperor, as the emperor's closest eunuch), became angry. Tian, believing that Yang would act against him and Chen, decided to act first, and in spring 884 recalled Yang to the imperial government to serve as You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), a highly honored official position with little power. In anger, Yang declared a campaign against Chen and Tian instead and launched troops to attack Xichuan. Emperor Xizong issued an edict stripping Yang of his offices and making Gao the acting military governor of Dongchuan, to attack Yang Shili, with the Xichuan officer Yang Maoyan (Ê•äËåÇË®Ä) serving as his deputy commander. Gao built 12 camps around Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (Ê¢ìÂ∑û) to wear out Yang Shili's army. Yang Shili's officers Zheng Junxiong (ÈÑ≠ÂêõÈõÑ) and Zhang Shi'an (ÂºµÂ£´ÂÆâ) reacted by launching a surprise attack against Gao's camps at night. Initially, Gao's troops were surprised, and when the Dongchuan forces concentrated their efforts on Yang Maoyan's camp, Yang Maoyan abandoned it and fled, causing many soldiers to panic and flee as well. The Dongchuan forces then attacked Gao's personal camp. Gao counterattacked and defeated them, forcing them back into the Zi city walls. Gao gathered up the soldiers and executed Yang Maoyan, and then resumed his siege of Zi. Gao's siege, however, was not initially successful. He therefore sent public letters to Yang Shili's officers (by putting the letters on the arrows and then shooting the arrows over the city walls) that stated that he was not interested in killing Dongchuan soldiers, and that as long as they delivered Yang Shili's head, all will be spared. In response, Zheng started a mutiny against Yang Shili, who then committed suicide. Zheng surrendered the city. Thereafter, Gao was made the military governor of Dongchuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  Death  By 886, however, Chen Jingxuan had become suspicious of Gao Renhou's intentions, as Gao appeared to have cut off his communications with Chen by this point. It happened at that time, Zheng Junxiong,The Zizhi Tongjian actually referred here to \\"Zheng Junli\\" (ÈÑ≠ÂêõÁ´ã), but the New Book of Tang indicated that it was the same person as Zheng Junxiong. who had been made the prefect of Sui Prefecture (ÈÅÇÂ∑û, in modern Suining, Sichuan), attacked and captured Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan), and then marched on to Chengdu. Chen sent his officer Li Shunzhi (ÊùéÈ†Ü‰πã) to defend against Zheng's attack, and Li defeated and killed Zheng. Chen then used this opportunity to mobilize the ethnic Qiang troops of Wei (Á∂≠Â∑û) and Mao (ËåÇÂ∑û, both in modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan) Prefectures to attack Gao. They defeated and executed Gao. Gao was later posthumously honored in the Qianning (894-898) era of Emperor Xizong's brother Emperor Zhaozong (who had declared and waged a campaign against Chen).

The area was founded in the 12th century by King Mowena II the first born son of King Matlebjane II of Batau. The Batau clan trace their origin from the Swazi.They moved north to Lake Chrissie from Wakkerstroom. They went from there to Mokwena River (which today is called Crocodile River) and established themselves in the Mpumalanga Mountains. The area was initially called Ga Mokwena since the late 1200s till the time the settlers colluded with Masemola to overthrow King Mokwena. King Mokwena was the first born son of paramount King (kgoshi kgolo ) Matlebj√†ne II. Masemola is the 5th son to King Matlebjane II. The elder brother to the ones ruling now is king Mokoena in Mpumalannga the onrs ruling in Ga M√†semothe √†re the descendants of Mokwenyana. Both Mokoena √†n Mokoenyana √†re the descendants of Masemola the younger brother t9 Kgoshi Mokwena. Kgoshi Mokwena was named after king Mokwena who was the father to king Matlebjane II. History =Settlers= In the 1880s emigration to South Africa was strongly encouraged by president Paul Kruger and support committees were set up throughout the Netherlands. In 1883 a company, under the leadership of Wolterus Dull, was established to strengthen ties between the Netherlands and South Africa. The first settlers from the Netherlands arrived during the period 1884-1887 let by Wolterus Dull. The area was proclaimed as a town in 1893 by Paul Kruger and was originally named Dull's-stroom, later simplified to Dullstroom, after the settlers‚Äô leader Wolterus Dull and the Crocodile River (stream) nearby. =Founding= Matlebjane II had six. The first son was Mokwena, second Seloane, third Mogashoa, fourth Phaahla, the fifth Masemola and lastly Photo. Seloane, Mogashoa, Phaahla and Masemola, got worried that the king‚Äôs gifts (dibego) were continuously being taken to the younger king's wife (the mother to Photo). They then all agreed to murder the king, but were worried about what people will say. So they conceived a plan, since Photo was still a teenager, they somehow convinced him that all of them including him Photo should kill the king at night with their spears. But there was a plan Seloane, Mogashoa, Phaahla and Masemola cooked up which Photo was not privy to. During that night the brothers got into the king's resting place and all stabbed the king; the king died. In the morning Photo discovered that he had been fooled by his brothers‚Äîhis brothers' spears were turned deliberately at the sharp tip and he alone had killed the king. So only his spear had blood while his brother's spears did not have blood as the spears were deliberately blunted. Photo's brothers then cried aloud hysterically with painful voices, that Photo has killed their father. From then on Photo was despised and rejected by the people for having killed his father. The killing of Matlebjane II by his sons is the reason we have the following idioms today: *Matlebjane o bolaile ke tswala. *Ka hlagolela leokane la re go gola la ntlhaba? The Batau lived at the Mokwena River for a period spanning 200 years. This was a time of relative peace and stability. Some people believe that their ruins and remains are still visible there in Mokwena (Crocodile) River, Dullstroom. Ga Masemola surrounds ga Maphutha village. Maphutha (from the Swazi name Mabuza), was a brother to Masemola. The history of Batau was distorted and is still distorted. There is a need for historians through the right sources to rewrite the history of Batau. Originally when king MatlebjaneII was murdered, His first born son ( Mokwena) did not participate in the plot to assassinate King Matlebjane II. Only the younger brothers to Mokwena II participated in the assassination of the GreatKhalanga, Nguni and Batau King Matlebjane II. I want to rectify the fact that Matlebj√†ne had six sons and the fact that Mokwena is the eldest. When the ones ruling in Ga Masemola arrived in the Northern Transvaal, they were not kings but were made chiefs by King Mokwena as a token that they are sons of his younger brother, Masemola. They were under direct authority of king Mokwena together with Nkotsana, the father of Ga Nchabeleng.

Established 1 June 1907, the club was active until 1973 when they became part of the tradition of present-day side SV Nord Wedding 1893.  History  Nordstern played lower tier football throughout its early history. In 1931, they were joined with Berliner FC Humboldt 1927, and two years later merged with Berliner FC Teutonia 1909 to form Spielverbindung Teutonia-Nordstern 07 Berlin.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . After the end of World War II in 1945, Germany was occupied by the Allies and authorities banned organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs, a part of the process of de-Nazification. New clubs were soon formed and the former membership of Teutonia-Nordstern was re-organized as Sportgruppe Osloer Stra√üe. They were part of the postwar Stadtliga Berlin in 1945‚Äì46 where they finished in second place in Staffel B, which qualified the club to play in the Oberliga Berlin (I) the next season. In October 1947, the club was renamed SG Nordstern Berlin and by 1949 had retaken its historical identity as BFC Nordstern. They played two seasons in the city's top competition until slipping into second class football. Nordstern returned to the Oberliga after a second-place result in the Amateurliga Berlin (II) in 1951 and struggled through four seasons there as a lower table side. Sent down in 1955, the team was relegated again the next year. They made their way back to the Amateurliga in 1957 and remained a fixture there until being sent down after a 12th-place finish in 1972. On 1 June 1973, they merged with VfL Nord Berlin to create Sportverein Nord-Nordstern. The club advanced to the Landesliga Berlin (IV) in 1982 for a two-season turn and, following German reunification in 1990, returned to a greatly enlarged Landesliga circuit to play three more seasons from 1992‚Äì95.

He is usually depicted as a short thick kind of little man dressed in the long garments of a monk with a broad brimmed hat.  Tradition  The tradition of the Monaciello seems to pertain exclusively to that portion of Southern Italy consisting of Naples and its surroundings. According to the tradition, the precise place where it dwells does not appear to be accurately known; but it is reasonably supposed to be in some of those remains of Abbeys and Monasteries that crown many of the hills of this area. He is an expert in the underground passages of Naples, and goes through them in order to attend old palaces and of course causes much annoyance. The Villa Gallo at Naples is said to be haunted by one of these gentlemen. He is also fond of playing tricks: to pull clothes off people, to steal quilts from bedrooms, to harass housewives. The Monaciello is also thought to be a beneficent spirit; he appears to people always at the dead of night, only to those who are in sorest need, who themselves have done all that they could do to prevent or alleviate the distress that had befallen them, and after all human aid had failed. He mutely beckons to them to follow him. If they have courage to do so, he leads them to some place where treasure is concealed, stipulating no conditions for its expenditure, demanding no promise of repayment, exacting no duty or service in return; it is not known if this treasures are the fruits of ill-got gains or the fruits of peaceful industry treasured up for occasions of love and charity. Several are said to have made sudden fortunes through him, and hence when anyone has had a sudden increase of fortune they say \\"Forse avr√† il Monaciello in casa\\" (perhaps he has had the little Monk in his house). This beneficent household demon may also be propitiated by food which they expect to see converted into gold; but he must not boast of such supernatural gifts, else they vanish as they come. It is believed that treasure suffices for the requirements of those who received it.  Possible explanation  The habits of this Monaciello are similar to those of the water carrier in ancient Naples. There were a lot of tunnels that connected all the wells in town and the water carriers had to be short people in order to pass through them. By mean of these tunnels, they had access to most houses, and also their overalls resembled the garments of the monks.  In popular culture In the book The King of Mulberry Street, the character Dom (Beniamino), as well as his mother and grandmother, mention \\"Monaciello\\", saying he is a kind trickster and protector of children.

It was distributed in the United States by Analysis Film Releasing Corp under the title Stuntwoman. Plot Mike Gauch√© (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is a professional film stuntman who works with his fianc√©e Jane Gardner (Raquel Welch). However minutes before their long planned marriage they are called to perform a car stunt for a movie but it goes wrong, as a brake problem causes their car to fall and they end up in a hospital with bruises and broken legs. Exasperated by the behavior of her fianc√©, Jane decides to leave. After his recovery Mike is no longer able to find work in the movie business and is forced to simulate mental retardation and to invent a family to receive Social Security benefits. One day his stuntman friend Santos asks him to replace him from time to time at his job which involves dressing up as a gorilla for advertising pasta at a supermarket. Mike's luck begins to improve as he gets offered a high salary to do the stunts of an effeminate movie star Bruno Ferrari (Jean-Paul Belmondo) whom he proves to be a dead ringer to. Ferrari, while filming an action movie, suffers from vertigo and finds himself unable to perform dangerous sequences. Mike does not hesitate to get rid of his new stunt partner in order to replace her with Jane, who is enamored with the Count of Saint-Prix (Raymond G√©r√¥me). Having heard the news Mike goes to the Count while impersonating a server in order to propose the offer to Jane. When he hears that the Count has asked to marry Jane he manically sabotages the dinner and makes Jane promise to do the film. Desperate to regain Jane, Mike impersonates Ferrari who turns out to be gay, to seduce her. However the young woman is not fooled. Mike must perform a dangerous stunt on the wing of an airplane to an audience of journalists who think they are seeing Ferrari, where his life is saved from the accident by Jane, who is to marry the Count very soon. Meanwhile, the press discovers that Ferrari is not doing his own stunts. While the wedding ceremony takes place at the castle of the Count, Mike arrives disguised as a gorilla, scaring guests with animals from the property, and takes Jane, who refuses to marry Count of Saint-Prix, preferring to live her life with Mike.

Perhaps most famous for having Portland Head Light on its grounds, the park also encompasses the decommissioned and largely demolished United States Army post Fort Williams, which was operational during World War I and World War II. Historic sites =Portland Head Light= Portland Head Light is a lighthouse inside Fort Williams Park in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Construction began in 1787 at the directive of George Washington, and was completed on January 10, 1791. Today, Portland Head Light stands 80 feet above ground and 101 feet above water, its white conical tower being connected with a dwelling. The 200,000-candlepower, DCB 224 airport-style aerobeacon is visible from 24 miles away. The grounds and the keeper's house are owned by the town of Cape Elizabeth, while the beacon and fog signal are owned and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard as a current aid to navigation. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Portland Head on April 24, 1973, reference number 73000121. =Goddard Mansion= Goddard Mansion Goddard Mansion, a prominent ruin inside Fort Williams Park, was built in 1853‚Äì59 for Colonel John Goddard. Colonel Goddard was a businessman who commanded the 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry Regiment for three months during the American Civil War. The mansion was purchased in 1898 by Judge Joseph W. Symond. In 1900, it was acquired by the federal government during the expansion of Fort Williams. The mansion was converted to quarters for non-commissioned officers and the basement was used as a non-commissioned officer's club. The mansion's remaining walls still stand on the hill overlooking Fort Williams. =Fort Williams= A former fort of the United States Army, Fort Williams operated from 1872 to 1964. =Fort Williams-War Time= Portland Headlight began to transform into a fort in 1896 with the installation of the first battery. By 1898, the first 3 batteries were installed and by 1899, the title was officially Fort Williams. Following the acquisition of additional acreage by the Army in 1900, major expansions took place including a barracks, officers‚Äô quarters, hospital, and more. With the United States‚Äô involvement in the Great War beginning in 1917, Fort Williams was placed on alert. Prior to the war, each battery, such as Battery Blair, was manned by 3 companies consisting of 80-100 soldiers. Due to catching the tail-end of the war, the German Navy was no longer considered a threat, and many of the soldiers stationed would be sent to Europe. In 1939 and through much of World War 2, the fort was heavily manned once more by members of the 240th Coastal Artillery Regiment. When test-firing the old batteries the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Battery Blair destroyed surrounding property due to the shock blast. By 1944, all of the original batteries and cannons had been removed as the fort was transitioning into an administrative headquarters. Fort Williams remained as an administrative headquarters until 1964, when the town of Cape Elizabeth purchased the property.Tess Nacelewicz. \\"Fort Williams at 100 Cape Elizabeth‚Äôs Grand Old Sentry, Which Has Been Transformed Into One of the Prettiest Parks Anywhere, Hits the Century Mark, and the Town Plans to Celebrate Through the Summer:[CITY Edition].\\" Portland Press Herald, 1999.Kim, Ann S. \\"Unearthing Fort Williams' Past: Officials Contemplate the Feasibility of Restoring Historic Battery Blair.\\" Portland Press Herald, 2010.

Based on the IAR-822, it was a conventional low-wing monoplane with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage and differed from its predecessor mainly being a design for an all-metal version of the 822. Development The IAR-826 is an agricultural crop sprayer and duster. It is the direct descendant of the IAR-822. The design was completed under the leadership of engineer Radu Manicatide in 1973, at IMFCA Bucharest (Institutul de Mecanica Fluidelor si Cercetari Aerospatiale ‚Äî Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Aerospace Research). Since the wooden structure technique was obsolete, the team led by Manicatide produced a design for an all-metal version of the 822. The IAR-826s were built at IAR Brasov in smaller numbers than the 822. A low-wing monoplane, the fuselage skin was entirely made of aluminium and the controls and trimmer were electrically actuated. The all-metal structure, although much more stiffer, lowered even more the already weak thrust to weight ratio. It was built at IRMA (Intreprinderea de Reparatii Material Aeronautic ‚Äî Enterprise for Aeronautical Material Repairement), in Bucharest. Operational history Designated IAR-826, it first flew on 9 May 1973. Three weeks later the IAR-826 prototype, YR-MDA was displayed at Le Bourget. IAR 826 were in use until the early 80's, with an average on 400 flight hours / year / airframe; being used mostly as agricultural planes, but sometimes also for the aerial surveillance of the pipe lines and power lines.

He was transported to Australia as a convict in 1827, after which he would become one of the most important early artists in the colony, despite never really separating himself from his life of crime. Gould's life in Van Diemen's Land was the subject of the award-winning historical fiction novel Gould's Book of Fish (2001), written by Richard Flanagan, centring on Gould's production of the Sketchbook of fishes. In April 2011 Gould's original Sketchbook of fishes was recognised as a document of world significance by UNESCO. Early life Gould was born as William Holland in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. While little is known of his early life, it is thought that he received artistic training under Irish painter William Mulready, R.A., in London, and German lithographer Rudolph Ackermann in The Strand, and that he worked in Spode's factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, as a painter of porcelain. Gould evidently moved around England quite a bit, and on 7 November 1826 he was convicted in Northampton, East Midlands, of having by \\"force of arms stolen one coat\\", and was subsequently sentenced to \\"seven years beyond the seas\\", a phrase indicating transportation to the then British penal colony of Australia. While the sentence was for the fairly standard term of seven years, as with most convicts, Gould would never return to England. At the time of this conviction, Gould was married and had two children, and had also received a prior conviction for \\"stealing colours\\". Life in Van Diemen's Land A northeast view of Macquarie Harbour, 1833, W.B. Gould, watercolourGould was transported to Australia aboard the convict ship Asia, arriving in Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), in December 1827. During the journey he was known to have painted portraits of the officers. Gould was sent to work on the brickfields, but was soon in trouble again, mainly for petty offences involving theft and drunkenness. In June 1829 Gould was sentenced for forgery of a banknote to three years at Macquarie Harbour Penal Station on the west coast of Tasmania, one of the most notoriously harsh penal stations in the colonies, generally reserved for only the worst convicts. Still life, fruit, (1832). Most likely painted while Gould was working as house servant for Scott The only access to Macquarie Harbour from Hobart at the time was by ship around the rugged south and west coasts of Tasmania. During the voyage Gould's brig, the Cyprus, became weather bound in the isolated Recherche Bay some south of Hobart, where half the convicts aboard mutinied and took the ship. Gould was amongst the convicts left marooned along with the officers, and he was one of a party who went overland by foot to seek help. Lieutenant Governor Sir George Arthur commuted the sentences of the convicts who had remained with the officers, and Gould was assigned as a house servant to the colonial surgeon Dr James Scott. Still life, flowers in a blue jug, (c1840). Painted while a free man An amateur naturalist, Scott put Gould's artistic talents to use, having him paint watercolours of native flora regarded even today as being of a high technical standard. Gould however would not remain out of trouble, and was again sentenced to Macquarie Harbour in 1832. Based on his reputation from his time with Scott, Gould was assigned as house servant to another amateur natural historian, Dr William de Little on Sarah Island at the penal station. Here he continued with his painting, producing highly accomplished still life watercolours of botanical specimens, birds, fishes, and other sea life collected from the surrounding beaches. His work also included landscape sketches providing important insights into the convict settlement. The Macquarie Harbour settlement was closed in 1833, and along with the other remaining prisoners, Gould was transferred to the Port Arthur Penal Station on the south-east coast of Tasmania. Gould was granted his Certificate of freedom from Port Arthur on 25 June 1835, and worked briefly for a coachbuilder in Launceston in the north of Tasmania, before returning to Hobart and marrying Ann Reynolds in 1836. While he continued his mainly still life artwork, the quality of the work became variable, and he descended into a cycle of drunkenness, poverty, and prison sentences for theft. Gould died of natural causes at his home on Macquarie Street, Hobart on 11 December 1853. Notable works Towtrer, Port Davey area, Tasmania, c.1833, W. B.

The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston holds 177 of his botanical works. A number of works, including a self-portrait, hang in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in Hobart. His work is also held by the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Entally National House, Franklin House, Launceston, and Narryna Heritage Museum, Hobart.

This sketchbook consisted of thirty-six separate watercolour-on-paper sketches measuring x each. While only six of these works are signed by the author, and none are dated, all works are attributed to Gould. The sketchbook includes a numbered list of the fish, with common names written in pencil by G. T. Stilwell, and species names in pencil by A. M. Olsen, who is thought to have formally identified the fish. The original sketchbook with leather binding and marbled board covers is now held by the Allport Library and Museum of Fine Arts, in the State Library of Tasmania; due to its age and condition it is not available for general access, however a digital version is available on the internet. This work was made famous in recent times by Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan's critically acclaimed and Commonwealth Writers' Prize winning 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish. This book is a fictionalised account of Gould's life in Van Diemen's Land, focussing on his time at Macquarie Harbour and his work on the Sketchbook of fishes. The book includes a reproduction of Gould's Weedy seadragon painting on the cover (although the actual image used varies depending on the edition), and other works from the sketchbook as the twelve chapter frontispieces. The blurb on the back cover starts with: > Once upon a time, when the earth was still young, before the fish in the sea > and all the living things on land began to be destroyed, a man named William > Buelow Gould was sentenced to life imprisonment at the most feared penal > colony in the British Empire, and there ordered to paint a book of fish. Another Tasmanian author, Richard Davey, also uses Gould's Weedy sea dragon painting from the Sketchbook of fishes on the cover of his 2002 book, The Sarah Island Conspiracies, as does the Tasmanian Historical Studies issue dedicated to Tasmanian Creativity and Innovation. UNESCO Memory of the World listing Gould's Sketchbook of fishes was inscribed on the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register at a ceremony in Hobart on 1 April 2011. This is the equivalent of a World Heritage listing for historic documentary material, recognising the sketchbook as a document of world significance. It was noted that the sketchbook contained the first record of a number of species. A spokesman for the CSIRO stated that current scientists still used information from the sketchbook, adding that little was known today about some of the species that Gould had drawn.

All depth-first search trees and all Hamiltonian paths are Tr√©maux trees. Tr√©maux trees are named after Charles Pierre Tr√©maux, a 19th-century French author who used a form of depth-first search as a strategy for solving mazes... They have also been called normal spanning trees, especially in the context of infinite graphs. In finite graphs, although depth-first search itself is inherently sequential, Tr√©maux trees can be constructed by a randomized parallel algorithm in the complexity class RNC. They can be used to define the tree-depth of a graph, and as part of the left-right planarity test for testing whether a graph is a planar graph. A characterization of Tr√©maux trees in the monadic second-order logic of graphs allows graph properties involving orientations to be recognized efficiently for graphs of bounded treewidth using Courcelle's theorem. Not every infinite connected graph has a Tr√©maux tree, and the graphs that do have them can be characterized by their forbidden minors. A Tr√©maux tree exists in every connected graph with countably many vertices, even when an infinite form of depth-first search would not succeed in exploring every vertex of the graph. In an infinite graph, a Tr√©maux tree must have exactly one infinite path for each end of the graph, and the existence of a Tr√©maux tree characterizes the graphs whose topological completions, formed by adding a point at infinity for each end, are metric spaces. Example In the graph shown below, the tree with edges 1‚Äì3, 2‚Äì3, and 3‚Äì4 is a Tr√©maux tree when it is rooted at vertex 1 or vertex 2: every edge of the graph belongs to the tree except for the edge 1‚Äì2, which (for these choices of root) connects an ancestor-descendant pair. center However, rooting the same tree at vertex 3 or vertex 4 produces a rooted tree that is not a Tr√©maux tree, because with this root 1 and 2 are no longer an ancestor and descendant of each other. In finite graphs =Existence= Every finite connected undirected graph has at least one Tr√©maux tree. One can construct such a tree by performing a depth-first search and connecting each vertex (other than the starting vertex of the search) to the earlier vertex from which it was discovered. The tree constructed in this way is known as a depth-first search tree. If uv is an arbitrary edge in the graph, and u is the earlier of the two vertices to be reached by the search, then v must belong to the subtree descending from u in the depth-first search tree, because the search will necessarily discover v while it is exploring this subtree, either from one of the other vertices in the subtree or, failing that, from u directly. Every finite Tr√©maux tree can be generated as a depth-first search tree: If T is a Tr√©maux tree of a finite graph, and a depth-first search explores the children in T of each vertex prior to exploring any other vertices, it will necessarily generate T as its depth-first search tree. =Parallel construction= It is P-complete to find the Tr√©maux tree that would be found by a sequential depth-first search algorithm, in which the neighbors of each vertex are searched in order by their identities.. Nevertheless it is possible to find a different Tr√©maux tree by a randomized parallel algorithm, showing that the construction of Tr√©maux trees belongs to the complexity class RNC.. As of 1997, it remained unknown whether Tr√©maux tree construction could be performed by a deterministic parallel algorithm, in the complexity class NC.. =Logical expression= It is possible to express the property that a set T of edges with a choice of root vertex r forms a Tr√©maux tree, in the monadic second-order logic of graphs, and more specifically in the form of this logic called MSO2, which allows quantification over both vertex and edge sets. This property can be expressed as the conjunction of the following properties: *The graph is connected by the edges in T. This can be expressed logically as the statement that, for every non-empty proper subset of the graph's vertices, there exists an edge in T with exactly one endpoint in the given subset. *T is acyclic. This can be expressed logically as the statement that there does not exist a nonempty subset C of T for which each vertex is incident to either zero or two edges of C. *Every edge e not in T connects an ancestor-descendant pair of vertices in T. This is true when both endpoints of e belong to a path in T. It can be expressed logically as the statement that, for all edges e, there exists a subset P of T such that exactly two vertices, one of them r, are incident to a single edge of P, and such that both endpoints of e are incident to at least one edge of P. Once a Tr√©maux tree has been identified in this way, one can describe an orientation of the given graph, also in monadic second-order logic, by specifying the set of edges whose orientation is from the ancestral endpoint to the descendant endpoint. The remaining edges outside this set must be oriented in the other direction. This technique allows graph properties involving orientations to be specified in monadic second order logic, allowing these properties to be tested efficiently on graphs of bounded treewidth using Courcelle's theorem.. =Related properties= If a graph has a Hamiltonian path, then that path (rooted at one of its endpoints) is also a Tr√©maux tree. The undirected graphs for which every Tr√©maux tree has this form are the cycle graphs, complete graphs, and balanced complete bipartite graphs.. Tr√©maux trees are closely related to the concept of tree-depth. The tree-depth of a graph G can be defined as the smallest number d such that G can be embedded as a subgraph of a graph H that has a Tr√©maux tree T of depth d. Bounded tree- depth, in a family of graphs, is equivalent to the existence of a path that cannot occur as a graph minor of the graphs in the family. Many hard computational problems on graphs have algorithms that are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-depth of their inputs.. Tr√©maux trees also play a key role in the Fraysseix‚ÄìRosenstiehl planarity criterion for testing whether a given graph is planar. According to this criterion, a graph G is planar if, for a given Tr√©maux tree T of G, the remaining edges can be placed in a consistent way to the left or the right of the tree, subject to constraints that prevent edges with the same placement from crossing each other.; . In infinite graphs =Existence= Not every infinite graph has a normal spanning tree. For instance, a complete graph on an uncountable set of vertices does not have one: a normal spanning tree in a complete graph can only be a path, but a path has only a countable number of vertices. However, every graph on a countable set of vertices does have a normal spanning tree.. See in particular Theorem 3, p. 193. Even in countable graphs, a depth-first search might not succeed in eventually exploring the entire graph, and not every normal spanning tree can be generated by a depth-first search: to be a depth-first search tree, a countable normal spanning tree must have only one infinite path or one node with infinitely many children (and not both). =Minors= If an infinite graph G has a normal spanning tree, so does every connected graph minor of G. It follows from this that the graphs that have normal spanning trees have a characterization by forbidden minors. One of the two classes of forbidden minors consists of bipartite graphs in which one side of the bipartition is countable, the other side is uncountable, and every vertex has infinite degree. The other class of forbidden minors consists of certain graphs derived from Aronszajn trees.. The details of this characterization depend on the choice of set-theoretic axiomatization used to formalize mathematics. In particular, in models of set theory for which Martin's axiom is true and the continuum hypothesis is false, the class of bipartite graphs in this characterization can be replaced by a single forbidden minor. However, for models in which the continuum hypothesis is true, this class contains graphs which are incomparable with each other in the minor ordering. =Ends and metrizability= Normal spanning trees are also closely related to the ends of an infinite graph, equivalence classes of infinite paths that, intuitively, go to infinity in the same direction. If a graph has a normal spanning tree, this tree must have exactly one infinite path for each of the graph's ends. An infinite graph can be used to form a topological space by viewing the graph itself as a simplicial complex and adding a point at infinity for each end of the graph. With this topology, a graph has a normal spanning tree if and only if its set of vertices can be decomposed into a countable union of closed sets. Additionally, this topological space can be represented by a metric space if and only if the graph has a normal spanning tree..

The pass provides a way through the northern Amanus Mountains (modern Nur Mountains), connecting Cilicia to southern Anatolia and northern Syria. It is one of two passes through the Amanus, the other being the Syrian Gate to the south.Smith, William. A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, 1878, s.v. 'Amanides Pylae' The Amanian Gate was mentioned in the ancient Nabonidus Chronicle.  The Amanian Gate and the Battle of Issus  The pass played an important role leading to the Battle of Issus. The Persian army advanced through the Amanic Gate or another nearby pass, coming behind the Macedonian army which turned back to face and defeat the Persian army. The exact Persian strategy remains in dispute. According to Jona Lendering, after a part of Alexander the Great army occupied the Syrian Gate, Darius III of Persia decided to lead his army north through the Amanian Gate and place his army between the two Macedonian armies at the town of Issus. However, the Macedonians joined forces before the arrival of Darius, and the outcome was Persian defeat. However, Donald Engels rejects a similar interpretation.Engels, Donald, 1978, Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army, p. 53 fn. 137.  The Amanian Gate, the Mardaites, and the Fortifications According to some historians, after the conquest of the Levant by the Arab Caliphate, the Mardaites, Christians following either Miaphysitism or Monothelitism, gained a semi-independent status around the Amanus Mountains within the Byzantine-Arab border region. They initially agreed to serve as spies for the Arabs and to guard the Amanian Gate, but their loyalty was intermittent and they often sided with the Byzantines instead. Because of the numerous late antique and medieval fortifications built north of the Belen Pass on established west-to-east routes through the Amanus Mountains, there is some confusion about the location of ‚Äúthe‚Äù Amanian Gate. The most likely candidate is just south of the modern Bah√ße, which is guarded by the castle of Sarvandikar, built in the 11th and 12th centuries during the period of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. To the south other fortresses guarding five separate Amanus passes between Cilicia Pedias and the Syria-to-Mara≈ü highway include: Hasanbeyli, Karafrenk, √áardak, Kozcaƒüƒ±z, Mitisin, and Mancƒ±lƒ±k. Just to the north of Bah√ße on a road of considerable antiquity is the Arab fortress of Haruniye (the modern D√ºzi√ßi), built in the late 8th century and later occupied by the Armenians and the Teutonic Knights.

Although a Brazilian group, South Cry often writes songs in English and has three albums.  History  The band emerged in 2000, when three guys, from Lambtown and the city of Bom Jardim, Rio de Janeiro, decided to get together to form a group of rock musicians. After a while, the band managed to record a demo called \\"Don't Drink My Tears\\" in a studio in Bom Jardim. The music was played on some radio stations of the region, having wide acceptance, and this encouraged the South Cry to develop their first album, called \\"Beyond Metaphor\\". This debut album was recorded in Bom Jardim, in the year 2001-2002. It was released in 2003 with many difficulties, because the band did not have adequate tools, having used borrowed equipment, and a poor production system. However the album was considered a surprise, having received rave reviews in magazines about music, like the Rock Brigade. After recording, the band got signed to a label, but that contract was only for distribution, not having involvement with projects for dissemination. Despite these difficulties, South Cry continued trying to publicize their work, performing and writing up a video clip of the band's first hit, \\"Virtual Freedom\\" independently. After a period of hiatus with no new recordings, South Cry felt the need to write a new work. Then an uncle of Guill Erthal, guitarist, financed the recording of their second album, titled \\"Keep an Eye on Me\\" in a studio in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 2007. Despite not having a heavyweight producer, the second album (2008) made the group leverage its disclosure, managing to put songs on the radio celebrities, such as Radio Transamerica, of Brazil. First the song \\"Virtual Freedom\\" (from Beyond Metaphor) had been released, even before the recording of Keep an Eye on Me. Shortly thereafter, the songs \\"Rebel Angel\\" and \\" Whatever You Try\\" became part of the radio broadcast. Despite gaining notoriety, South Cry could not gain more disclosures for the second album. In 2009, the American Jeremiah Thompson took over as manager of the band, creating the label Big Sky Rock. Thus, work began to be disclosed, even if timidly out of Brazil, in countries like the United States and Denmark. Soon after the band began looking for big producers, which would give visibility to a possible third disc. Many producers of weight were asked if interested in working with South Cry, then the winner of the Grammy Sylvia Massy was chosen to produce the third release. The album Blue Moon, the first non-independent, was recorded in mid-2010 at the famous Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas, which has hosted renowned artists such as U2, Bob Marley, Iron Maiden and the Rolling Stones.Nova Imprensa, South Cry: da regi√£o serrana para o mundo , Retrieved 3 January 2011.Indie-Music.com, Reviews, Retrieved 3 January 2011.

(Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Hawthorne, NY)  Early life and education  He was born in New York in 1866 and studied at City College of New York, St. Francis College and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. McGuire's training at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts in Paris made him a deft practitioner in the Beaux-Arts styles.  Architectural practice  His Holy Trinity Church (1910‚Äì12) on West 82nd Street in New York's Upper West Side, has a dome of Guastavino tile. According to Frederick D. Talor in his article \\"Medieval New York ‚Äì Holy Trinity Church\\", the church was built deliberately in the Byzantine style, unusual for the time, and has been \\"considered to be one of the finest examples of Byzantine architecture in this country.\\" He also designed the Actors' Chapel at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church on West 49th Street in the theater district and St Rose of Lima in Rockaway Beach, New York City. McGuire's most prominent commission, however, was the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia (1903‚Äì06). He was chosen as architect for this Cathedral by philanthropist Thomas Fortune Ryan who provided much of the funding for the construction and with whom McGuire had previously collaborated to build the Church of the Sacred Heart in Manchester (now part of Richmond). The Virginia Landmarks Register states that the Cathedral is \\"a glorious celebration of Roman Catholic art and architecture\\" and also mentions that the original plans for the building are preserved in Richmond's Valentine Museum. Among his commissions for schools, hospitals, commercial buildings and some residences were the designs for the chapel and assembly hall at Westchester Protectory and St Elizabeth's Hospital, New York.

Churches =Original location= The parish was founded in 1857 as an offshoot of the Church of St. Columba and Holy Cross Church, with boundaries from \\"28th to 38th Street and from 6th Avenue to the banks of the Hudson.\\" The community initially met in a chapel structure of renovated townhouses. The original church plan was begun in 1861 and completed in 1868, with a front on 31st Street, between 9th and 10th Avenues. The church was built in phases surrounding the chapel and without disturbing services there. When finally completed according to the original plans, it was wide by long and had a stone facade and high tower on 31st Street and an interior nuns' gallery on two sides. It was designed by the founding pastor, Arthur J. Donnelly (1820‚Äì1890), and architect T.S. Wall. The church complex also consisted of a rectory, convent and schools, the latter designed by architect Lawrence J. O'Connor, FAIA. During 1874‚Äì1884, the complex was the original home of the Presentation Sisters in the northeastern United States, and enrollment grew to become the largest parochial schools in New York. The Sisters and the parish also founded the Mount Saint Michael Home for destitute children, in Greenridge, Staten Island. The Manhattan church contained an 1862 Henry Erben mechanical action organ. On May 4, 1892, a fire destroyed much of the church and the organ. =Second location= O'Connor was contracted to design a new structure which incorporated the original tower and acquired a new Indiana bluff limestone facade on 32nd Street. Other details include a roof elevated higher than the original church, a vaulted ceiling, aisles with groined arches, fourteen Munich stained glass windows, and a gallery in the form of a choir loft with a new 1893 Odell organ at the rear of the church. The blessing Mass was scheduled for Sunday, January 28, 1894. The total dimensions were wide by long. In 1892, the address was listed at 408 West 32nd Street.The World Almanac (New York: Press Publishing, 1892), p. 390. =Third location= In 1904, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company began proceedings for the construction of the North River Tunnels and Pennsylvania Station, which would require the demolition of St. Michael's 32nd Street church and complex. At the suggestion of the pastor, John A. Gleeson, the Archdiocese sold the parish properties in exchange for a new church, school, convent, and rectory on 34th Street. The office of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons was responsible for the construction of the new complex, which involved the salvage and re-use of the altar, organ, stained glass windows, and limestone facade. The church was dedicated November 10, 1907. It was described at the time as Romanesque, wide by deep and high. It also had a 2,000-person basement chapel with an ceiling.

History Quely biscuits date back to the 18th century to sailing companies who required food that could be stored for long periods of time. The oven in Can Guixe that produced these biscuits in the 19th century can still been seen in Inca today. Jaime Dom√©nech Borr√°s purchased land in 1934 to construct the first factory building, but production was delayed by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. It was 1940 before he was able to order all the necessary equipment. World War II caused further challenges, with the stonework oven being constructed during the war. After the death of Dom√©nech in 1947, his sons, Jaime and Gabriel, completed his work, with the factory going into production in the following decade. Under the name \\"Quely\\" (the original choice of \\"Cor de Mallorca\\" unavailable due to then legal challenges), the biscuits became successful in the Mallorcan market during the 1960s.

Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. .  History  Early in its history, the club flirted with failed partnerships. In 1911, they joined with SV Niedersch√∂nhausen for a year. They merged with BFC vom Jahre 1893 in 1918 to play as Sportvereinigung Normannia vom Jahre 1893 in another short-lived partnership lasting just a year. In 1928, they adopted the name Berliner Sportclub Normannia before later becoming Sportverein Normannia. Throughout this period and through to the end of World War II, the team played lower-tier local football. The club briefly disappeared in the aftermath of the war when occupying Allied authorities banned organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, a part of the process of denazification. New clubs soon emerged in the latter half of 1945 and the membership of Normannia was re-organized as Sportgruppe Nordost alongside a large part of the former membership of Nordiska Berlin. Normannia was re-founded on 15 April 1950 and resumed its place as a lower-tier local side. The club's greatest success came with their advance to the Amateur Oberliga Berlin (III) for a single season turn in 1971‚Äì72.

It is located north of Limestone, Maine. It was closed in 1980. History Caswell was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent Air Defense Command network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. Because of difficulties with new production radar equipment, the site initially consisted of a pair of AN/FPS-10 radars from a closing Lashup site at Limestone AFB, Maine (L-50) to expedite operational status. During 1951 the 766th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved from the temporary site at Limestone AFB to Caswell and assumed coverage, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Thus Caswell received the ‚ÄúLP-80‚Äù designation. In 1955 and 1956 an AN/FPS-8/UGPS-3 was installed. The AN/GPS-3 remained in service until 1961. In 1957 and 1958 the AN/FPS-10s were phased out and two AN/FPS-6As arrived. During 1959 Caswell AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-05 at Topsham AFS, Maine. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 766th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1961 an electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) capable AN/FPS-7C began search duties. An AN/FPS-26 height finder radar began operation as well. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-80. The facility came under Tactical Air Command jurisdiction in 1979 with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the activation of ADTAC. In addition to the main facility, Caswell operated this unmanned AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler site: * Bridgewater, ME (P-80B) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 766th Radar Squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1980. With its closure, Caswell Air Force Station became a Maine National Guard training site. Many USAF buildings still in use, although some are in deteriorating condition. The FPS-7 and FPS-6 towers still stand along with other operational buildings. The Bridgewater Gap Filler site doubled as a fire-lookout tower. Both the building and radar tower remain today.

In New York City in particular, commercial graffiti is big business and since the 1980s has manifested itself in many of the major cities of Europe such as London, Paris and Berlin. Increasingly it has been used to promote video games and even feature prominently within them, reflecting a real life struggle between street artists and the law. Commercial graffiti has created significant controversy between those who view it as an effective medium of advertising amongst specific target audiences and those who believe that legal graffiti and advertising using it encourages illegal graffiti and crime. History Commercial graffiti in Germany Graffiti as a commercial activity dates back to Ancient Greece, when pottery makers employed artists to decorate their items with motifs and intricate designs. The modern era, the phenomenon has been strongly associated with New York City since the late 1960s and the hip hop culture that emerged in the 1980s, according to a 1993 New York Times article that focused on the issue. The term \\"commercial graffiti\\" was used in an article by Time as early as 1968 and used to describe activity in Chicago as early as 1970. In 1981, Times Square was referenced as featuring \\"commercial graffiti\\" through \\"Japanization\\", and more recently further \\"Japanization\\" of children's culture is cited to be taking place through forms of graffiti in video games and in the increasing popularity of Japanese innovations such as anime. Since the early 1980s, commercial graffiti has evidenced itself in Los Angeles and other major American cities and across Europe, particularly Paris, and London and Berlin and features on the walls of numerous galleries across Europe. With the increasing popularity and legitimization of graffiti, it has increasingly undergone commercialization. In 2001, computer giant IBM launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a peace symbol, a heart, and a penguin (Linux mascot), to represent \\"Peace, Love, and Linux.\\" However, due to illegalities some of the street artists were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive and clean-up costs. Controversy Commercial graffiti on a truck in Paris The practice of commercial artistry is controversial, because many commercial establishments feel that professional graffiti art is a valuable form of advertising, while other businesses, law enforcement and others disagree. Legal and commercial graffiti is increasing and has created significant debate amongst graffiti writers and those associated with hip-hop culture. The primary concern by those who oppose graffiti is that the tolerance of professional graffiti in one space leads to more illegal graffiti in other spaces. In some areas such as sports, over advertising in sports venues and even player uniforms in soccer has sometimes been viewed negatively. Commercial graffiti, seen as a frontier between the street world and the art world, is argued in some cases to promote a more responsible lifestyle for the graffiti artist through formal employment, which may range from actual graffiti advertising on buildings, to making prints and logos for clothing and gallery showcasing. Nancy MacDonland in her book The graffiti subculture: youth, masculinity, and identity in London and New York argues that commercial graffiti artistry \\"moves writers out of the boundaries of the subculture\\", because artists \\"no longer paint for their peers and themselves, they have a new audience\\". Even in major cities such as New York City and Chicago, commercial graffiti has created some very mixed reactions. For instance in Chicago, despite a significant following in graffiti artistry, in the mid 1980s a commercial which featured a kid spraying \\"The end is near\\" caused considerable outrage by Chicago citizens who protested to the Ford Motor Company to take the commercial off air as they believed it encouraged children to freely graffiti property as they desire. Similarly, in 2005, Peter Vallone Jr., a City Council member in New York and several other councilors protested against Sony's decision to use graffiti commercially in their PlayStation Portable advertising in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami as they believed it would have a negative influence on children and encourage them to deface property. Commercial success Commercial graffiti in Fashion Street, London In New York City, legal graffiti and employment has become big business, appearing with owners' permission on everything from walls to railroad boxcars. According to Cooper and Sciorra, many young graffiti artists are keen to use their talents and aspire to achieve entrepreneurial success. Local businesses employing well-known graffiti artists are also said to enhance their credibility and business- customer relationship as well as reducing crime by employment. One prominent group in New York City is the \\"King of Murals\\" which run a commercial graffiti business and have been employed to promote global brands such as Coca-Cola and M&M;'s in advertising campaigns and even hired by schools, hospitals and other healthcare groups to create artwork. Bronx-based TATS CRU has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Toyota, and MTV. Smirnoff and even Microsoft have hired artists to use reverse graffiti (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. In 2011, Klughaus Gallery started Graffiti USA, a company offering interior graffiti murals for companies. Their work includes murals at the corporate offices of Linked In, Facebook, MasterCard, and ABC News, which featured a Graffiti USA commissioned mural on October 8, 2014 episode of Nightline. In Boston, Massachusetts, a company named Alt Terrain specializes in hiring graffiti writers to paint legal murals as part of public performances which are hyped as \\"brand events\\" and may cost up to $12,500 for live performances. In Pittsfield, Massachusetts for example, after the death of Michael Jackson, Solomon \\"Disco\\" Stewart and a team of four artists named \\"The Berkshire Graffiti Network\\" for instance were paid to paint a \\"Michael Jackson Tribute\\" mural on the wall of a Pittsfield market on North Street. Legal advertising graffiti on grocer's shop window in Warsaw, Poland In the United Kingdom, Covent Garden's Boxfresh used stencil images of a Zapatista revolutionary in the hopes of cross referencing would promote their store. Even the Israeli West Bank barrier has acted as a canvas for professional graffiti for hire teams. One Palestinian pacifist group will spray paint any message for 30 Euros, providing that it is not racist or violently motivated. The Art Crimes website is the first to be established in the field of commercial graffiti and hires some sixty artists to produce artwork. =In video games= An example of crossover between video game culture and graffiti culture found on the Berlin Wall Graffiti has become an important part of video game culture, often reflecting the oppression facing graffiti artists in public and battle for it to be seen by the establishment as a legitimate and indeed a legal art form. The Jet Set Radio series (2000‚Äì2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a totalitarian police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' freedom of speech and others such as Rakugaki ≈åkoku series (2003‚Äì2005) for Sony's PlayStation 2 revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Similarly Marc Eck≈ç's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure (2006), features a story line involving training in graffiti artistry and fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the Jet Set Radio series. Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti, such as the Half-Life series, the Tony Hawk's series, The Urbz: Sims in the City, Rolling and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. =In apparel= Graffiti has become a common stepping stone for many members of both the art and design community in North America and abroad. Within the United States, graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Persue, Rime, Noah and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8 Osiris or CircaGanz, Nicolas. \\"Graffiti World\\". New York. Abrams. 2004 Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, The Mac etc. which have developed into gallery artists and at times do not even use their initial medium (spray paint) to produce artwork. Keith Haring, a well-known graffiti artist, contributed to bringing graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works‚Äîwhich until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities like bags and T-shirts. Haring explained that, \\"The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement\\". Marc Ecko, an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that \\"Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career.\\" But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is by the French crew, 123Klan. 123Klan founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, have gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced, logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for numerous global firms. =Tourism= Most of the major cities across the world have graffiti and street art tours, often run by local graffiti artists who want to bring their talent to the public on a more socially accepted level. Originally started with walking or biking tours around the cities, street art tours have expanded to include graffiti workshops, using graffiti art tools, stencils and spray cans. Tours exist in New York, London, Berlin, Hamburg, Reykjavik, Barcelona, Montreal and Paris. = Marketing = Commercial graffiti is used as a type of marketing known as guerrilla marketing where one company has limited funds for advertising its product may it be goods or services. Generally done by smaller companies at the beginning due to small budgets but adopted by big brands (e.g. Coca-Cola). This type of marketing has a way of going viral as it is done in a public place with limited resources but with new technology such as smart phones which can upload pictures and videos instantly to social media, so if there is legal permission by the government for graffiti people would do it during peak hours in communities for maximum exposure( Navr√°tilov√°, L.

The agency is headed by Salim Muslumov. History Throughout the Soviet rule, the social insurance and pensions to citizens in Azerbaijan were provided by the state. The Soviet system of pensions was based on no contribution principle with employed citizens not directly contributing to any funds, and the state issuing pensions directly from the state budget or state organizations. In 1990, the Soviet Social Insurance Fund was founded and all enterprises, establishments, organizations, cooperatives, state farms, collective farms and other organizations in the country had to make contributions to this fund. In 1991, by the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR, Social Insurance Fund of Azerbaijan SSR was established. After restoration of independence of Azerbaijan in the second half of 1991, the Azerbaijani branch of the Soviet Pension Fund was transformed into the Pension Fund of Azerbaijan by the Presidential Decree dated December 16, 1991. On June 1, 1992 the National Assembly of Azerbaijan passed a law \\"On the normative allocations for the Social Insurance and Employment Fund\\", according to which the social insurance contributions would make 40% of the gross payroll. The Pension Fund was to receive 85% of that amount, while the remaining 15% went to the Social Insurance Fund. In order to improve and modernize the social security system in the country, on September 30, 1992 President Abulfaz Elchibey issued a decree abolishing the Pension Fund and the Social Insurance Fund, and establishing the State Social Protection Fund in their place. Laws on social insurance and pension reforms in 1997 and 2001 further improved the social security system putting it in line with international standards. On August 4, 2003 another Presidential Decree \\"On measures for improving the state pension system in Azerbaijan Republic\\", the functions of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population of Azerbaijan Republic on providing, financing and control over payments of pensions and additional benefits were passed to the State Social Protection Fund. Due to reforms related to the single insurance‚Äìpension system in the country through 2006, the servicemen of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces and persons with special ranks became covered by the mandatory social insurance. Structure The fund is headed by Chairman and a Deputy who are appointed by the president of Azerbaijan.STATE SOCIAL PROTECTION FUND OF THE AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC 13 divisions are included in the central office of SSPF: * Pension policy, insurance and strategic research Division * Finance Division * Division of Labor * Law Division * Internal Audit Division * Division for Organization of Individual Accounting * Division of Information Technology * Division for Employment and Training * Budget Execution Division * Division for work with retirement documents and appeals * Economics Division * International Relations Division * General Secretariat Division It has a board of seven directors, which include the chairman, two deputies, the chairman of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, head of the central office of the fund, head of finance and budget department and the director of the department of the fund for work with the military personnel and persons with special ranks.  Duties of SSPF  Main functions of the agency are working out proposals on state policies in the field of social insurance and labor pensions; preparation of draft budget of the fund and ensure control over the approved budget; ensuring collection of mandatory state social insurance contributions from all entities and individuals engaged in work activity; enforcing control over implementation of legislative requirements in the process of mandatory social insurance; issuing pensions from the fund's budget; issuing benefits for temporary disability, pregnancy and child delivery, childcare limited to periods stipulated in legislation; issuing full or partial payments for spa treatments of the insured; issuing funeral grants, etc. According to the fund management, its revenue grew by 8.7% in the first half of 2010. The number of individual personal accounts of the insured is 1,732,215. In 2011, 97.2% (AZM 1.916 bn) out of its total expenditures in 2011 will include payments to the population.  Pension payment system  SSPF carried out a project to introduce new pension and benefits payment system in 2004-2006. The main advantage of the system was to get pensions by plastic cards via ATMs. As a result of implementation of the project people in all cities and regions of Azerbaijan, even in remote areas, have been provided with plastic cards, and got opportunity to get their pensions and benefits via relevant ATMs. Approximately 860 thousand persons get their pensions and benefits via ATMs. This forms 80% of the total number of the pensioners.

Delaveyne was born in the village of Saint-Saulge in 1653, in the ancient province of Nivernais. As a teenager, he went to the city of Autun to start his education. After studying with the Society of Jesus, in 1669 he entered the Abbey of St. Martin in that city, at about the age of 16. He was soon sent to Paris, spending the following seven years studying there. He made his religious profession there in 1670. While there, he was drawn into the artistic and literary circles of the elite of Parisian society. After his ordination in 1676, he was sent to his hometown to serve as its pastor, continuing to lead a life mostly focused on the intellectual pursuits of the literary life. Two years later, a chance remark by the pastor of a neighboring village contrasting his way of life to that of St. Benedict re-ignited the religious fervor of Delaveyne's youth. He returned to his monastery in Autun for a spiritual retreat, in order to find again the focus of his life. From this experience he returned to his parish a changed man. In his re-found religious mindset, Delaveyne began to see the misery of the poor of the parish, especially those in the countryside. He started to work to relieve their physical as well as their spiritual needs. Out of these efforts, in 1680 Delaveyne invited a group of young women of the parish to organize to care for the needs of women and children. He advised them: In this way, Delaveyne founded the religious congregation of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, which has operated hundred of convents and schools throughout France since its founding, with its motherhouse still in Nevers. The most famous member of the congregation is St. Bernadette Soubirous, the visionary of Lourdes. Delaveyne died in Nevers in 1719.

Following the release of her album Maya earlier in 2010, the artist announced via Twitter that she would be releasing a mixtape on the last day of the year, and subsequently made it available free to download. It incorporates reworked versions of tracks from Maya and new material and was reported as having been inspired by the 2010 WikiLeaks controversy, although much of its content is not politically inspired. Background M.I.A. performing in 2011 M.I.A. released her third album Maya in July 2010 to mixed reviews. In early December, she announced on Twitter that she would be following it up with a mixtape to be released on 31 December, stating \\"vicky leekx mixtape coming new years eve! layin bad minds to rest 2010!\\" The mixtape was uploaded online from Bangkok, Thailand after she sent it via YouSendIt to a friend, stating \\"VICKILEEKX up/loaded in BANGKOK! thank u, for being a dope ass people/city. cant seem to leave please kick me out! or i wont go!\\" Exclaim! writer Josiah Hughes contended that the latter portion of the message referred to events which had occurred during the year including the album's mixed reviews and her clashes with journalists and former collaborator Diplo. Shortly before Christmas, the website vickileekx.com began displaying a countdown to the mixtape's release in the form of animated water rising up a dateline, and on 30 December M.I.A. uploaded a TwitPic showing the track listing and credits. Zach Baron, writing for The Village Voice, contended that the singer deliberately chose to release the mixtape at the point in the year when internet traffic is traditionally at its lowest, so as \\"not to feed the online content machines that chewed her up this year\\". Music and lyrics The material included reworked tracks and out-takes from Maya, with previously unreleased material. Some of the tracks, including \\"Let Me Hump You\\" and \\"Gen- N-E-Y\\", had been made available by M.I.A. earlier in the year at a series of bespoke website addresses. The tracks \\"Meds and Feds\\" and \\"Steppin' Up\\" from Maya appear in radically altered forms, including the removal of the heavy guitar played by Derek E. Miller of the group Sleigh Bells on the original version of the former. A number of reviewers made a connection between the mixtape's title and the 2010 WikiLeaks controversy. Although the mix opens with a quote about the leaking of information and subsequent legal and political attacks from Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, delivered by a female voice, much of the content is not related to the controversy or politically themed. Musically, the mixtape is less abrasive in style than the industrial-influenced Maya, but the lyrics contain a number of attacks on \\"imitators, haters, and [...] psychos\\" and \\"bitches who are fame hoes\\". The female voice heard at the start, identified by reviewers as the \\"title character\\", returns sporadically during the mix speaking internet slogans. At different points the music incorporates heavy percussion, Auto-Tuned vocals, and \\"bhangra-style\\" sounds similar to those heard on her second studio album Kala. Most of the mix is at a high tempo, although it slows towards the end, where the longest sections are found. Release and reception Vicki Leekx has been downloadable for free since 31 December 2010 from a bespoke website. In its review of the mixtape, Sputnikmusic commented that \\"Maya Arulpragasam might have had a rough year, but with Vicki Leekx, she's ended it with a bang\\". Tom Breihan, a writer from Pitchfork, commented that in \\"its brief onslaught of sneery fun, Vicki Leekx only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of Arular and Kala. But it does give us an M.I.A. who, once again, seems to be having a blast doing what she's doing. And it's great to learn this M.I.A. still exists\\". As of 6 January 2011, the track \\"Bad Girls\\" has been listed as \\"Best New Music\\" by the same website. Matthew Cole, reviewing the mixtape in Slant Magazine, described Maya as \\"an act of musical self- immolation from a self-styled outsider uncomfortable with her own marketability\\" but that Vicki Leekx was an \\"ensuing ground-zero dance party\\" to follow up such a \\"levelling of her image\\". Mike Schiller, writing for webzine PopMatters, was positive in his review but stated that the mix sounded like \\"an artist throwing ideas at a wall and seeing what sticks\\". In consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave Vicki Leekx a B+ rating, indicating \\"remarkable one way or another, yet also flirts with the humdrum or the half-assed\\". Track listing Although the mixtape consists of a single 36-minute file, the artwork released to accompany it lists twenty \\"tracks\\". Personnel The artwork released to accompany the mixtape credits the producers, listed as M.I.A. herself, Danja, Munchi, Diplo, Blaqstarr, Switch, Rusko, VIIXIIV (a pseudonym for her brother Sugu Arulpragasam) and So Japan, and featured vocals by Rosaly Pfeffer, credited mononymously as Rosaly. The name of Nguzunguzu, a duo which includes Asma Maroof, M.I.A.'s tour DJ, is also prominently displayed, although it is unclear what involvement the duo had in the project.

He was recognized by the Soviet Union as a People's Artist of Russia and a State prize-winner. An asteroid called 4267 Basner, discovered in 1971, was named in his honour. He was a member of the St Petersburg Union of Composers. Early life and initial success Veniamin Basner had been playing the violin from the age of six and graduated from the Leningrad Conservatory in 1949 with the violin as his principal instrument. Basner made his first experiments in composition at the age of fifteen. In 1955 he was a prize-winner, for his Second String Quartet, at the International Composers' Competition in Warsaw. Biographer Alexander Uteshev has remarked that this marked the start of his most intense period of creative activity.Veniamin Basner ‚Äì Biography by Alexander Uteshev Basner and Shostakovich Veniamin Basner, while still a student, met Dmitri Shostakovich, under whose advice his formation as a professional composer was furthered. They became personal friends. Basner‚Äôs widow, Lusha Basner, has elaborated on how Basner became Shostakovich‚Äôs student: \\"Basner wanted to take composition lessons from Shostakovich, but didn‚Äôt dare to approach him. Shostakovich, who was a sensitive person, noticed this and helped Basner by asking him to light his cigarette. That‚Äôs how Shostakovich became Basner‚Äôs teacher.\\" Henny van de Groep 2005 DSCH Review: ‚ÄúZun mit a regn‚Äù and interview of Sofie van Lier. DSCH Journal 23:13-17 (July 2005) Another in his circle of friends was Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg who, as revealed by Lusha Basner, entrusted his archive to Basner after he was released from his arrest in 1953. At the time Basner held an influential position in the Composers‚Äô Union - and \\"Weinberg trusted him.\\" Henny van de Groep 2005 DSCH Review: ‚ÄúZun mit a regn‚Äù and interview of Sofie van Lier. DSCH Journal 23:13-17 (July 2005) Much later, Basner and Weinberg were amongst the six friends of Shostakovich (the others being Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, and Boris Tishchenko) who rejected the controversial Testimony (–°–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ), said to be the \\"authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich.\\" (As stated in the article on Testimony.) Compositions Basner‚Äôs musical output spanned a wide spectrum in terms of genre and emotional substance. It encompasses, at the more academic end, thirteen works for musical theatre, symphonic suites, three symphonies, vocal symphonic cycles, two concertos and five quartets, which have been performed to critical acclaim in Russia and beyond. At a more popular level, he became widely known, reaching millions of people through his film music - for more than a hundred productions - and his over three hundred song compositions. He drew particular inspiration from the events and pathos of the Second World War in works which, as Uteshev puts it, express simultaneously the ‚Äúconfession of a lonely soul as well as a voice of national grief.‚Äù The Fourth Quartet and Violin Sonata particularly evoke the pain of personal loss - as does, for example, the song On The Nameless Height (–ù–∞ –±–µ–∑—ã–º—è–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤—ã—Å–æ—Ç–µ), based on a real event and is about three soldiers, fifteen of whose friends had died in battle. Melodies from his well-known songs are woven into more substantial works such as the Second Symphony and the Fifth Quartet. The most important and impressive quality of Veniamin Basner's music, suggests Uteshev, is ‚Äúan inspired lyricism [which] powerfully permeates all his art.‚Äù Recordings Recordings include: * Suites for Films The Immortal Garrison, \\"The Leningrad Symphony\\", Destiny of a Man ‚Äì performed by the Academic Symphonic Orchestra of the Leningrad Philharmonic. * String Quartets recorded by the Taneyev Quartet. * Valery Gavrilin recorded a ‚Äò‚ÄôFirst German Notebook‚Äô‚Äô in 1981, with Sergei Leiferkus (baritone) and Irina Golovnyova (piano), Sound-producer Gerhard Tses.

The Federal style building is a row house. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1983 it was included as a contributing property in the West Third Street Historic District. History The property on which the building stands is in the oldest section of the city. with It was purchased by John Hiller from Davenport founder and developer Antoine LeClaire in 1847. Hiller himself was a builder who is responsible for the construction of the Clock Tower building on the Rock Island Arsenal. This row house was built in three sections in 1852, 1856, and 1859. The expansion reflected the city's population explosion in the 1850s. Because there was a need for rental properties, Hiller expanded his own home and rented out the extra rooms. It is not certain which of the three sections is the original. The Schick family bought the building from the Hillers in 1902. It is believed that this is one of the oldest extant buildings in Davenport. The building has sat empty since 2015 and it has been on Davenport's \\"repair or demolish\\" list since 2016. Its south wall is bowing, crackling and it is losing some of its stones. Jamey Licandro bought the property in 2020 and plans to shore up the structure and renovate the building for apartments as he has done to other historic buildings in the city. Also in 2020, the building was included as one of nine \\"most endangered\\" properties in the state by Preservation Iowa. Architecture The two-story rectangular structure houses apartments that are symmetrically arranged along interior corridors. The north wall is composed of stone laid in ashlar fashion and covered in stucco. There are rough irregular shaped stones on the basement level and on the upper two floors of the main fa√ßade. The north side of the fa√ßade features stone pilasters with mock capital wood crowns that flank the entranceway. The northeast corner has stone quoins.

He is responsible for developing the theory of the Universal Stages of Evolution, the concepts of personal and cultural entropy, and creating assessment instruments (based on Maslow's hierarchy of human needs and models of higher consciousness) to map the values of individuals, organisations, communities and, nations to the Seven Levels of Consciousness Model. He founded the Barrett Values Centre in 1997.Handbook of Workplace Spirituality and Organizational Performance by Robert A. Giacalone, Carole L. Jurkiewicz, p. 335 Early life and education Richard Barrett was born on 7 March 1945, in Kingston upon Hull, United Kingdom. In 1966, he graduated from Manchester University with a First Class Honors degree in Civil Engineering. He received a postgraduate engineering degree in highway and transportation engineering from Newcastle University . Career After spending time working for the Municipality of Leicester and Freeman Fox & Partners, he set up his own consultancy practice in 1977. He acted as a consultant to the World Bank from 1979 to 1985, officially joining the World Bank as a staff member in 1986. In 1992, he became the Assistant to the Vice- President for Environmentally Sustainable Development and started the World Bank Spiritual Unfoldment Society. From 1995 to 1997, he conducted an inquiry into values at the World Bank. Throughout this period (from 1967 to 1997) Barrett spent most of his spare time studying psychology, spirituality, physics, and personal transformation. He left the World Bank in 1997, and created the management consulting firm of Richard Barrett & Associates (which became the Barrett Values Centre in 2007). The purpose of this organisation was to \\"provide consultants, change agents and human resource professionals with tools and techniques for assessing their values and implementing organizational transformation.\\"Conscious Globalism: What's Wrong with the World and How to Fix It by David A. Schwerin, p.196 In 1998, he published Liberating the Corporate Soul: Building a Visionary Organisation, in which he described the Seven Levels of Consciousness model and the values mapping instruments known as the Cultural Transformation Tools. He also introduced the concept of the Seven Levels of Leadership Consciousness. From 1986 to 1999, Barrett lived in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1999, he moved to Western North Carolina in the vicinity of Asheville. From 2005 to 2007, he spearheaded an inquiry into Whole System Change in organisations. The results of this inquiry are presented in Building a Values-driven Organisation: A Whole System Approach to Cultural Transformation, published in 2006. In this book he showed how the Cultural Transformation Tools had been used to transform the cultures of organisations. He also introduced the concepts of cultural entropy, and personal entropy and showed how they could be measured. Barrett said, \\"...more and more companies making some form of contribution to society. They have discovered that making money and making a difference are mutually supportive goals. When companies care about their employees, the local community and society, their employees, the local community and society care about them. The dynamic that I was measuring was simply the wisdom of the golden rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you, or, as I prefer to describe it, the energy you put out into the world is the energy you get back. This is particularly true with regard to employees.\\"Spirituality and Ethics in management by L√°szl√≥ Zsolnai , p.165 From 2002 to 2009, he developed the concept of Three Universal Stages of Evolution based on a more inclusive definition of the concept of consciousness. This theory is presented in The New Leadership Paradigm, published in 2011. This book is part of the integrated learning system with a Web site and downloadable learning modules for leading self, leading a team, leading an organisation and leading in society. Other concepts introduced in this book include the Seven Levels of Motivation, The Seven Levels of Identity, the Seven Levels of Happiness, and the Six Modes of Decision-Making. During the period 2001 to 2007, Barrett experimented using the Cultural Transformation Tools to map the values of nations. Between 2007 and 2010, these tools were used to map the personal values, current culture values, and the desired cultural values of a statistically valid sample 12 nations and several communities. In many of these nations, the results of the values assessments have been used to begin nationwide dialogues on values. In Latvia and Iceland, the results of the values assessments have been instrumental in reorienting public policies. From June 2009 to September 2010, Barrett moved to Hull to care for his mother who died at age 100 in August 2010. Barrett now lives in Bath, Somerset.

A second one opened in 1995 at Eastview Mall in Victor, New York, and a third at Colonie Center in Colonie, New York in 1997. In 2001, Trans World unified its other mall-based stores under the \\"f.y.e.\\" name after buying out Camelot Music. During that year, a major re-branding campaign made f.y.e. the brand name for all of Trans World Entertainment's mall-based retail stores as well as many freestanding locations, though some freestanding or strip mall stores continued to operate under regional brands like Planet Music. In 2016 the company changed the store and website branding to \\"FYE\\". In 2006, Trans World began remodeling buildings that were former Coconut stores and Media Play outlets near Salt Lake City, Utah and Buffalo, New York into FYE superstores.

In March 2017, FYE founder and CEO Bob Higgins died. Higgins was responsible for the creating the FYE brand as well as maintaining its profitability and therefore its status as the last remaining music chain store. In November 2018, FYE's parent company was accused in federal court of deceiving customers by asking them to sign up for \\"free\\" and/or \\"loyalty\\" membership programs and magazine subscriptions while charging their credit and debit cards $11.99 per month until customers canceled the services. Another allegation was that customer information was shared with marketing company Synapse without customer consent. In 2018, 33 FYE stores were closed, and 35 more were scheduled to be closed before the end of Trans World's fiscal year on February 2, 2019. In 2020, Sunrise Records announced and later finalized their purchase of FYE from TWEC.

Potter, the editor of the Davenport Gazette, had this house built from 1872 to 1873. with Alexander F. Williams, a partner in the wholesale and retail hardware firm Seig & Williams, bought the house in 1878. He continued to live here into the 1890s. Williams initially was involved in dry goods, but eventually moved into hardware. Seig & Williams was formed in 1869 and sold heavy hardware. Williams oversaw the buying for the company. Architecture The house was neither a pure representation of the Greek Revival style nor was it a typical expression of the style built by local builders. Instead, it was an adaptation based on the unusual topography of the site. From three sides the house was three stories tall, but the west side was built into a hill, so it appeared to be only two stories. It also stood out in a neighborhood that was mostly made up of small to medium-sized frame houses. The Potter‚ÄìWilliams House was a T-shaped structure with a gabled roof and a three-story porch in the reentrant angle. The gable ends featured a wide, molded frieze. The first floor was composed of battered stone walls while the upper floors were brick. All of the windows were rectangular, and those on the second floor were taller than the windows on the other floors. The lintels were all composed of stone, and were probably influenced by the Italianate style that gained in prominence in Davenport after the Civil War. Another decorative feature that was popular in other Greek revival houses in the city was a narrow molding strip that suggested a frieze. The hood over the west entrance of the house reflected the American Craftsman style.

A major goal is to describe when the differential equation can be solved by quadratures in terms of properties of the differential Galois group. The theory was initiated by √âmile Picard and Ernest Vessiot from about 1883 to 1904. and give detailed accounts of Picard‚ÄìVessiot theory. History The history of Picard‚ÄìVessiot theory is discussed by . Picard‚ÄìVessiot theory was developed by Picard between 1883 and 1898 and by Vessiot from 1892‚Äì1904 (summarized in and ). The main result of their theory says very roughly that a linear differential equation can be solved by quadratures if and only if its differential Galois group is connected and solvable. Unfortunately it is hard to tell exactly what they proved as the concept of being \\"solvable by quadratures\\" is not defined precisely or used consistently in their papers. gave precise definitions of the necessary concepts and proved a rigorous version of this theorem. extended Picard‚ÄìVessiot theory to partial differential fields (with several commuting derivations). described an algorithm for deciding whether second order homogeneous linear equations can be solved by quadratures, known as Kovacic's algorithm. Picard‚ÄìVessiot extensions and rings An extension F ‚äÜ K of differential fields is called a Picard‚ÄìVessiot extension if all constants are in F and K can be generated by adjoining the solutions of a homogeneous linear ordinary differential polynomial. A Picard‚ÄìVessiot ring R over the differential field F is a differential ring over F that is simple (no differential ideals other than 0 and R) and generated as a k-algebra by the coefficients of A and 1/det(A), where A is an invertible matrix over F such that B = A‚Ä≤/A has coefficients in F. (So A is a fundamental matrix for the differential equation y‚Ä≤ = By.) Liouvillian extensions An extension F ‚äÜ K of differential fields is called Liouvillian if all constants are in F, and K can be generated by adjoining a finite number of integrals, exponential of integrals, and algebraic functions. Here, an integral of an element a is defined to be any solution of y‚Ä≤ = a, and an exponential of an integral of a is defined to be any solution of y‚Ä≤ = ay. A Picard‚ÄìVessiot extension is Liouvillian if and only if the connected component of its differential Galois group is solvable . More precisely, extensions by algebraic functions correspond to finite differential Galois groups, extensions by integrals correspond to subquotients of the differential Galois group that are 1-dimensional and unipotent, and extensions by exponentials of integrals correspond to subquotients of the differential Galois group that are 1-dimensional and reductive (tori).

The species is endemic to Central America and Mexico. Taxonomy This species, Chelydra rossignonii, was previously considered a subspecies of Chelydra serpentina. It became a full species after scientists noticed some genetic differences and differences in the morphology of the two species' skulls. =Etymology= The specific name, rossignonii, is in honor of French-born coffee grower Jules Rossignon.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Chelydra rossignoni, p. 226). =Subspecies= There are no recognized subspecies of C. rossignonii. Description C. rossignonii has a big head, lengthy tail, pointed snout, and a coarse carapace with three easily seen ridges. Its carapace comes in different colors, such as brown to olive or olive to black, while its small plastron can be either cream to yellow or tan to gray. This turtle's shell sometimes also has algae growing on it, which helps it to camouflage. The skin is either gray or black all over on adults, while juveniles have white speckles on their skin; the skin is also covered in long tubercles near the turtle's neck area.  Distribution and habitat C. rossignonii is found in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. The natural habitats of C. rossignonii are slow-moving freshwater rivers, swamps, tributaries, and wetlands. It prefers murky water with large amounts of vegetation, and stays away from open water. Ecology and behavior C. rossignonii is oviparous. It is also solitary and nocturnal. The species is believed to be mostly aquatic, rarely going on land or basking in open spaces. =Diet= The Central American snapping turtle hunts by luring its prey with four to six barbels around the mouth. It is believed to be an omnivore that forages for an assortment of prey, including crabs, frogs, fish, shrimp, and plant material. Conservation In the last 30 years, C. rossignonii experienced a 30% population decline. It is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting for food. Although it is protected by the law in Mexico and Guatemala, these laws are not enforced evenly and this turtle is still being exploited. A captive breeding program has been established in order to help the species gain population.

It was initially limited to the Saybrook Neck, a peninsula separating North Cove from Long Island Sound on the west side of the Connecticut River. The colony flourished as a shipbuilding and maritime trade center, and its center of civic activity migrated westward to where the town center is now located, on the west side of the cove.

The area saw economic success into the late 19th century, and its architectural heritage reflects this.

The church developed leaks and was deemed unsafe in the summer of 2009, with worship services continuing in the auditorium of St. Augustine's Parochial School.Daniel Beekman, \\"New York Archdiocese may close Bronx parochial school St. Augustine School\\", New York Daily News, 2 December 2010 (Accessed 7 February 2011) Funds from the school had been helping pay the church building's upkeep. The Rev. Thomas Fenlon, pastor of the church, sought a developer to demolish St. Augustine's Church and build affordable housing on the site, constructing a new smaller church next door. In late 2013, the church, rectory and convent were demolished. Parish history The parish was canonically established in 1849 as the Bronx began attracting German and Irish residents. The first mass was held in a private residence on Boston Road. The Morrisania site for the present church on the northeast corner of Franklin Avenue and Jefferson Street was purchased in 1850 with a small wooden church immediately being erected. This in turn was replaced in 1858 by one of brick construction and dedicated by Archbishop John Hughes. In 1892, the parish address was at 867 Jefferson Street.The World Almanac 1892 and Book of Facts (New York: Press Publishing, 1892), p.390. That structure was destroyed in 1894 during a fire and the present structure was dedicated in 1895. As the Bronx grew in the early 20th century, Irish, German, and Italian immigrants swelled the congregation. To serve this enlarged parish, a parochial school (see below) was established in 1906. Ongoing construction with the parish school and significant debt accumulated towards the management of the church necessitated the parish to establish the Diamond Jubilee Campaign, which proved inadequate \\"to cope with the poor structural condition of the church\\" during the 1930s and 1940s.Peter Honerkamp, ‚ÄúInner-City Parishes ‚Äì St Augustine, New York,‚Äù Impact! (October‚ÄìNovember 1979). The post-World War II white flight from Morrisania and the South Bronx in general and the community's replacement with many African Americans from Harlem led to the congregation dwindling and becoming overwhelmingly African American by the late 1950s. By the late 1960s, the parish was reduced by a third again as drug-related issues affected the neighborhood. Outreach St. Augustine's held weekly masses in three languages. It sponsored many community programs, including a food pantry, a men's society, Alcoholics Anonymous, and youth dances. By the early 1970s, parish leaders, including the Rev. Robert Jeffers, began to strategize on how to improve the community. During that decade, a group of Franciscans began administering specifically \\"to children, elderly, and anyone else in need.\\" St. Augustine's School of the Arts was established in 1979 to provide neighborhood youth an arts-based curriculum. The church also established the Alpha Housing Coalition to provide assistance to neighborhood tenants and residents. Since the mid-1980s, the church was a member of the SHARE (Self-Help and Resource Exchange) Program, providing families with food packages in exchange for community service.Claudia McDonnell, \\"Hope Comes to the Inner City\\", St. Anthony Messenger (1986): 15-20. The church was a founding member in the 1987 establishment of South Bronx Churches (SBC), an organization providing area residents with housing and other services. As of December 2010, Sister Dorothy Hall ran the food pantry. St. Augustine's School St. Augustine's School is located at 1176 Franklin Avenue on the east side between East 167th Street and East 168th Street. According to the AIA Guide to New York City, the structure was completed in 1904. However, a New York Times article indicates the building permit was only filed in 1906, which would agree with the school's own history of its founding. (Alternatively, different buildings might be in question.) The parish history dates the parochial school's establishment to 1906. The original building was designed for 1,200 students but a new schoolhouse was constructed on Fulton Avenue in 1913 to accommodate greater numbers. It was reported in December 2010, that St. Augustine School was \\"one of six Bronx parochial schools facing closure by the New York Archdiocese because of dwindling enrollment and mounting deficits.\\" The school was also serving as the place of worship since the church building was deemed unsafe. \\"St. Augustine enrolled only 170 students this fall, down from 252 in 2008, with [school board member Michael] Brady blaming the bad economy and a tuition hike ordered by the Archdiocese. The school's families earn just an average of $16,000 per year, he said, but 100% of its students graduate on time and 98% go to college....The school is 10% Muslim.\\" Efforts to keep the school open included teachers agreeing to cut their salaries by 10% and the school launching a registration drive, which enrolled \\"45 new students in less than two weeks.\\" Tuition was 3% of their annual family income.

History Louis Schmidt was born in East Davenport in 1860 and was educated in the local public schools. He attended a Davenport business college and worked as a carpenter and contractor. Schmidt was a member of Carpenter's Union No. 4 and worked initially in a partnership with John H. Bertram as Schmidt & Bertram. Amelia L. Huschke was born near Davenport in 1866. The couple was married on November 26, 1889, at St. Margaret's Cathedral, and they lived in a house on Bridge Avenue with their three children. with They bought this property in 1891 and he built this house in 1895. The house served as the family's residence and as the base for Louis' business. The Schmidts lived in this house until the 1940s. Louis died in 1942 at 81 and Amelia died in 1957 at 91. She had outlived her four children. Amelia had sold the house in 1947 to Ruth Burchell, an antiques dealer. Burchell, who was single, lived here with George A. and Mabel Burchell, and Robert L. Burchell who worked as a furniture refinisher. Ernest and Inez Enge bought the house in 1950. He worked for the Davenport, Rock Island, and North Western Railroad. They sold the southern portion of the property to Mary E. Hootman in 1953. Inez died in 1976 at the age 85, and Ernest and his daughter Inez continued to live in the house. He transferred the title of the property to his children in 1980 and continued to live here until at least 1983. Ernest died in 1987 at the age of 99 at his son's home in Canton, Illinois. The house was rented to Joseph and Elaine Sheil from 1984 to 1989. Tina Burroughs, a realtor, bought the house in 1989 and lived here until 1991. Raymond, a biologist at Scott Community College, and Cheryl Reeves lived here from 1991 to 1996. They sold the property to Jolene M. Boddorf, who worked at the Rock Island Arsenal in 1996 and she sold it to William and Rebecca McCarley in 2003. Architecture The Schmidt House is a fine example of a Queen Anne style home that was popular in Davenport in the 1890s. It is typical of the simplified, middle-class interpretation of the style. It is a two-story, frame structure with a hip roof, lower projecting gables, and an irregular form. There is a front projecting gable-roof section and gable roofs extend over the two-story angled bay windows on the north and south elevations of the structure. A gable-roof section also extends from the back of the main hip-roof in the rear of the house. The gables feature fish scale wood shingles, carved boards, dentils, beads, and multi-light windows. The side porch at the rear of the house has turned columns, pilasters, and balustrade with decorative carved brackets. The large window on the front of the house features a leaded color transom. The stair window is a common style utilized in Queen Anne houses. The front porch is the only major exterior change to the Schmidt House. The house was originally built with a side porch, but no front porch. It was added sometime in the 1910s or the 1920s in the American Craftsman style. It features wide eaves, tapered square columns that rest on rusticated concrete block piers, and a wooden balustrade.

He designed, built, and tested early aeroplanes, being the first pilot to take off from the sea in Britain. He flew many missions in World War I, including some of the first ever bombing raids. He won honours from several countries, particularly for his part in the 1914 bombing of a German Zeppelin factory. Early life Sippe's parents were Charles Henry Sippe (1842‚Äì1924), a shipping export agent (whose firm, C H Sippe & Sons Ltd, still existed until c.2013), and Elizabeth Jane Thornton (born 1846). They had moved to Britain from Australia, both families having originally emigrated from Liverpool. The youngest of nine children, Sydney Sippe was born in 1889 in Brixton, London, where his parents lived at 17 Lambert Road.Sippe's birth certificate He was educated at Dulwich College from May 1903 to December 1905. Name and title Sippe was named after Sydney, Australia, where both his parents had lived.\\"Hero of the air\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 4 January 1915 His first name is often misspelled 'Sidney', even on official documents, and his surname sometimes written with an accent, 'Sipp√©', as if of French origin. The form 'Sydney Vincent Sippe' is used both on his birth and death certificates. Following his service during World War I, Sippe continued to use the title Major ‚Äì and was known as 'the Major' ‚Äì even though the RAF rank was renamed Squadron Leader in 1919. He also went by the nickname Pi (pronounced like 'pie'), and was known to his family as Pipi. Aviation pioneer After leaving school, in February 1906 Sippe became an engineering apprentice with British Westinghouse in Manchester. The Sippes' monoplane Between late 1909 and early 1910, just a year after Wilbur Wright first demonstrated powered flight in Europe, Sippe (aged 20), his brother Arthur, and their friend James Jensen (or Jenson) designed and built a monoplane from steel tubing. Its attempted maiden flight on 24 April 1910 at Addington, Croydon, failed due to insufficient power:Nick Forder, curator at the Museum of Science and Industry: The Friedrichshaven Raid > Sydney Sippe was thrown forward with some violence and his nose came into > collision with one of the steel tubes. The nose came off worst, and a piece > of flesh was removed from the inside of his thigh. That, with sundry > bruises, was all. A well-meaning friend rushed up with a flask of whisky, > which he thrust into the pilot's mouth, and so Sydney Sippe arrived home to > his mother with a broken nose, a bleeding thigh‚Äîand slightly > intoxicated.Letters page, Flight Magazine, 16 September 1960, quoting > Croydon Advertiser, date unknown (c. August 1960?). He learned to fly at the Avro school at Brooklands, gaining his licence in January 1912 \\"in a way which showed that he had thoroughly mastered the art\\".Flight Magazine, 30 August 1913. He immediately became a test and demonstration pilot. Three weeks after his flying test he survived a crash near Finchampstead caused by a frozen carburettor; the aircraft was wrecked, but Sippe escaped unhurt.Aeroplane Magazine, 1 February 1912, p. 110. In the spring of 1912 he test-flew the Avro hydro-aeroplane at Barrow-in-Furness, making the first ever flight from the sea in Britain on 2 April.Sydney Morning Herald, p. 10, 30 November 1914. He shortly afterwards tested a monoplane for Hanriot in France. Engine failure forced him to land in a cornfield; the plane ended up upside down, but was undamaged, and he flew it again in the first Aerial Derby.?Aeroplane Magazine on 6 June 1912 This was a race round London, competing against various European pilots including Thomas Sopwith. Engine trouble forced Sippe out of the race.\\"Sidelights from the Past\\", Aeroplane Magazine, 17 July 1942. Later that year he supervised the construction of aircraft in Milan for the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and took part in an Italian long-distance flying competition. On his return to the UK he took up flight testing and instruction at Salisbury. War service In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Sippe immediately joined up and was made a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Air Service. He took part in the Entente's very first bombing raids on D√ºsseldorf and Cologne; in the latter, after failing to find his designated target, he instead bombed Cologne railway station, causing serious damage. =Friedrichshafen raid= This was followed by a celebrated attack on the Zeppelin sheds and factories at Friedrichshafen, Germany on 21 November 1914, one of the first long-distance bombing missions. Sippe and two other pilots flew from Belfort, France, over mountainous terrain and in difficult weather‚Äîa risky flight near the limit of the aircraft's range. The distance was increased by the need to avoid flying over neutral Switzerland. Reaching the target area, Sippe crossed Lake Constance in mist while under heavy fire, descending to just ten feet above the water so as to use the mist as cover. Despite their aircraft taking damage, the three pilots succeeded in bombing their targets. Although substantial damage was claimed at the time and in some later histories,Hilary St. George Saunders: Per Ardua: The Rise of British Airpower 1911-1939, Oxford University Press, 1944. the damage inflicted was slight. One pilot was shot down and captured, but Sippe and the third pilot returned safely.Flight Magazine, 27 November 1914 page=1180 The raid was announced by Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, who called it \\"a fine feat of arms\\".Kenneth Poolman: Zeppelins over England, publ. Evans Brothers, 1960. One historian concluded: \\"The pilots deserve all praise for their admirable navigation... this flight of 250 miles, into gunfire, across enemy country, in the frail little Avro with its humble horse-power, can compare as an achievement with the best of them\\".The War in the Air, Vol. 1, Walter Raleigh, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1922. The bullet-damaged tail of Sippe's (or possibly one of the other pilots') plane was later mounted on a plaque as a souvenir.Cross and Cockade International, vol. 21, no.3, 1990. =Honours= Sippe and the other returning pilot received the French Legion of Honour (rarely given to foreigners) immediately after the Friedrichshafen raid, at the request of General Joffre himself. Sippe was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1915 New Year Honours, and the OBE in the 1919 New Year's Honours. He was also awarded the Croix de Guerre,Sydney Morning Herald, 23 June 1917 and made a Chevalier of the Belgian Order of Leopold. Sippe was mentioned in dispatches six times during the war. Cigarette cards Sippe was featured on at least two cigarette cards: one, with his photograph and short biography, no. 26 in a series of 50 Naval Portraits, was issued by Lambert and Butler in c.1917. Another, no. 2 in a series of 50 War Incidents, was issued by Wills. Both cards recounted the Friedrichshafen raid. Family In December 1915, Sippe married Mabel Frances D'Arcy,Flight Magazine, 17 December 1915. only child of Gerald d'Arcy of Dublin; they had two children, Angela and James, and four grandchildren. They subsequently separated, and were divorced in 1933 on the grounds of her adultery with a Greek man. Post-war life After World War I, Sippe went through a variety of jobs, mostly related to engineering or aviation. In the early 1920s he trained pilots in Japan. In 1922 he began a secret attempt to salvage what was thought to be ¬£2 million worth of gold coins (¬£100 million in 2012 prices) from the SS Tubantia, a ship which sank off the Dutch coast in 1916. When a rival salvage operation started the following year, Sippe won a landmark court case which ruled that, as his divers had found the ship and started work, he had the sole right to salvage it. In 1925, after ¬£100,000 (¬£5.2 million in 2012 prices) had been spent on the salvage attempt, he concluded that though the cargo had been in the ship, the difficulty of accessing it made it too dangerous for divers to recover, and so the project was abandoned. Sippe was a sales manager for ten years with Short Brothers (now a large aerospace business), then with Crossley Motors, followed by the Fairey Aviation Company from 1946 to 1955. He later founded his own business, Field and Forest Supplies, selling products of his own invention.Obituary in Dulwich College magazine, ?1969 In 1963 he became a consultant to the 20th Century Joinery and Packing Co Ltd, a company which specialized in packing aircraft parts for transport.Flight Magazine, 24 January 1963. He died of cancer in 1968 in Leatherhead Hospital.Sippe's death certificate.

The normal route should only be attempted by mountaineers with sure footing, no fear of heights and climbing agility. The approach is usually made from the south, i.e. from the Gaudeamus Hut or from the Ackerl Hut over the signposted Gildensteig climbing path, past the Wildererkanzel zigzagging up to the memorial tablet south of and below the Kleines T√∂rl. Another option is an approach from the north, i.e. from the Griesner Alm in the Kaiserbach valley via the Fritz Pflaum Hut and the Kleines T√∂rl to the memorial plaque. * Normal route Near the aforementioned memorial plaque, the signposted, but unsecured normal route branches off up to the Regalmspitze ab. It crosses steep slopes to a rocky gully, runs up the gully and then continues over very steep terrain and short steps to the wind gap between the Regalmwand and Regalmspitze. This is where the main challenge, the vertical wall of the Wandl has to be overcome (UIAA climbing grade II).

The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985. John C. Schricker John Schricker was a stone and marble contractor. His work included the Dillon Memorial in downtown Davenport and the Iowa Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument on the grounds of the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines. Schricker became a partner along with Captain Chris Schricker and F.G. Roddler in the Davenport Pearl Button Company in 1895. The company made buttons from clam shells harvested from the Mississippi River. They remained in business until the 1930s. Schricker hired the Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Clausen to design this house, which was built between 1909 and 1910. Architecture The Villa form of the Italianate style was popular in Davenport, especially in the 1870s and the 1880s. For the most part, they were built on or near the tops of the bluffs and their towers provided an excellent view of the Mississippi River Valley below. This is Schricker's second significant house in Davenport and he built it on a bluff on the far west side of the city in a place that remains fairly rural. It is one of the last expressions of the Italianate Villa found in Davenport. The house is an updated and simplified version of the style. It features a plain brick exterior and lacks the decorative window surrounds and bracketed cornices that were popular in the Victorian era. The primary decorative details are found at the house's main entrance. It features a wrought iron grill that was generally not found in Davenport until Mediterranean/Spanish Colonial Revival architecture became popular in the 1920s. See also *John C.

Before the onset of professional policing something often overlooked is the close relationship which once existed between the church and the imposition of law and order. In the Middle Ages the parish was the smallest unit of local government in the country. Every parish was centred around the local church, and after the Reformation was responsible for administering civil and religious government at a local level. Many parishes developed a vestry ‚Äì a small body of village officials, answerable only to the bishop and the local justices, and who were responsible for the ecclesiastical and secular well being of the parish they served. Parish constables, sometimes referred to as petty constables, were attested by justices of the peace but accountable to the local churchwardens. Like parish constables, church wardens were locally appointed and oversaw the administration of the parish, good order during services, and the upkeep of the church fabric and property. Similarly, many cathedrals employed constables to keep watch and maintain law and order within the cathedral and its precincts; an area often known as the Close. These officers were appointed by, and answerable to, the cathedral Dean and Chapter. Current operations Canterbury Cathedral Constable Senior officers at the CCA Leaders' Council Constables are employed at four cathedrals: * York Minster Police at York Minster * Liverpool Cathedral Constables at Liverpool Cathedral * Canterbury Cathedral Close Constables at Canterbury Cathedral * Chester Cathedral Constables at Chester Cathedral During the 21st century constables have also operated at: * Salisbury Cathedral Constables (abolished 2010) * Hereford Cathedral Constables (abolished 2014) Training, equipment, and uniform Cathedral constables wear a uniform very similar to British territorial police forces. =Attestation= Some officers are attested and hold the office of constable within the cathedral's curtilage, whilst others remain un-sworn. Constables who are attested wear a distinguishing royal blue and white Sillitoe Tartan chequered cap band to distinguish them from their Home Office police colleagues (black and white chequered cap band) and their un-sworn colleagues (plain hat bands). A number of officers at Canterbury, York, Liverpool and Chester are attested and hold the powers of constable in their respective cathedral and precincts. Newly appointed officers undertake pre- attestation training (provided by the CCA) together with training delivered by their own cathedral. Upon completion, officers are attested and can undertake Officer Safety Training (OST).https://www.cathedralconstables.co.uk/pb/wp_e33900ee/wp_e33900ee.html =Chief Officers= Most of the current constabularies distinguish their chief officer with the rank markings used by a police Inspector in a territorial force. This officer generally bears the title \\"Head Constable\\" or \\"Inspector\\". There is a formal command structure in each constabulary of Chief Inspector (Canterbury Cathedral only), Inspector, Sergeant, Constable and unattested Warden. The position of \\"Chief Officer\\" exists within the Cathedral Constables' Association (CCA).See CCA senior leadership details. =Training= Local training is supplemented by training opportunities organised by the CCA, including the level 3 Certificate in Cathedral Constable Attestation (see below), and individual personal safety training (PST) which is provided under contract by training officers of the Mersey Tunnels Police.See PST data at the CCA website. In 2018/2019 two officers, Chief Inspector Jim Morley (Canterbury Cathedral) and Cathedral Constable Adam Rickers (York Minster), were recognised nationally for their bravery in saving life by the Royal Humane Society. Cathedral Constables' Association Badge of the Cathedral Constables In order to advance professional development within the constabularies, as well as sharing best practice, providing channels of mutual cooperation, and preserving the history and traditions of cathedral policing, the Cathedral Constables' Association was formed by senior officers. Their motto 'In Deo Speramus' means 'In God we trust.' The association has published a short book 'Cathedral Bobbies' outlining the history, traditions, and work of cathedral constables.thumb The association, working with the national awarding body NCFE, has developed the level 3 Certificate in Cathedral Constable Attestation (CCCA). The award is aimed at serving officers who want to be considered for attestation. The CCCA is divided into seven units supporting knowledge and development in areas including conflict management, incident response, evidence and crime scene management, arrest and detention, offences against property, people, and public order, and PACE. Additionally, the association has become a registered centre with NCFE, allowing it to offer other qualifications accredited by the awarding body. The CCA has additionally forged links with the College of Policing and National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). The association's patron is the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Ian Blair Kt QPM.

Bandhu Sharma is best known for writing the award-winning book, Meel Patthar (Milestone). It is a collection of short stories that won him the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award, the second highest literary award of India. Early life and education Deen Bandhu Sharma or Bandhu, as he was fondly known amongst his family and friends, was born in October 1934 in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. His father, Pandit Jagdish Datt Sharma was the royal priest and the consultant to the king of Jammu & Kashmir, Hari Singh.

He had extensively read about Karl Marx and Lenin and developed a strong believe in Marxism from a very young age. He also greatly admired Shakespeare and had read all the work by the great playwright. Singing and writing career Bandhu‚Äôs father was inclined towards classical music and it is believed that well known classical singers would come over to his place and play with him and Bandhu would listen to them for hours. It is no surprise therefore, that he had a deep understanding and interest in classical music and grew up to be a very polished and respected vocalist. For many years, he was associated with Jammu and Kashmir radio station for singing shows and radio plays. However, after the birth of his first daughter, Archana he quit singing on air as it was not considered to be a respected profession in those days. This was the turning point in his life, and around 1964-1965, he started writing short stories in his mother tongue ‚ÄòDogri‚Äô. His first story \\"Bana Jitto\\" was much appreciated among writers, readers and media. Awards Bandhu Sharma was recipient of many awards.

The parish has a church and school, both of which were founded by the Rev. James Edward Kearney (1884‚Äì1977), later the Bishop of Salt Lake City and Bishop of Rochester. Parish The parish was established in 1928 and dedicated in honor of St. Francis Xavier (1506‚Äì1552), the Spanish-born Jesuit missionary to India and Japan, who died en route to China. The first pastor was the Rev. James Edward Kearney (1884‚Äì1977), who served St. Francis Xavier from 1928 until 1932, when he became Bishop of Salt Lake City. He later was to become Bishop of Rochester. John M. J. Quinn (1886‚Äì1955) was pastor from 1951 until his death in 1955, and headed a Catholic War Veterans organization. Fr. Kearney had been influential spreading Catholicism in the Bronx, founding this parish first \\"using two portable structures as a temporary church and auditorium.\\" During his pastorate, he also served as professor of religion at Good Counsel College in White Plains and as superintendent of parochial schools in the Bronx. In 2016 the traditional Corpus Christi procession was being held after Sunday Mass of this feast in June, under Frs. Robert Verrigni pastor and Matthew Reiman parochial vicar. St. Francis Xavier's Altar on Easter Sunday 2016 Buildings In 1951, a new building was erected at 1658 Lurting Avenue, at the intersection of Van Nest Avenue, in the Morris Park section of the Bronx. The church building was blessed and re-dedicated by Cardinal Spellman with more than 1000 people attending the ceremony. The architecture of the church is very monumental for its neighborhood, if a bit retrograde for its post-ward period of design. However, in contrast to the post-war Modernist brick box churches of this period, St. Francis Xavier's Church is designed in an early Gothic style with pointed arched windows and entrances accentuating a stolid masonry mass of low gabled nave and hipped square tower. in leafy and manicured lawned surroundings. The architecture is in the style of thirteenth-century Italian Gothic. The general red brick masonry of the walls is elegantly trimmed with white limestone, as is the corbelled tower cornice, which match the white masonry statues above the principal entrance gable and on the tower upper stage side elevations. \\"The parish has several substantial buildings, including what appear to be two schools. A convent was refurbished for the Franciscan sisters sponsored by Fr. Benedict Groeschel.\\" The address for the rectory is 1703 Lurting Avenue. The convent was likely originally built for the Sisters of Mercy. The eleven-bay, two-storey-over-raised-basement brick school with Romanesque design accents was built in 1937 and extended in 1955. The structure has a prominent, broad- hipped slate roof with an ornamental louvre surmounted by a copper-clad Latin cross. Despite varying dates, all the structures of the complex appear to have been built in harmonious styles with a brick color that very much matches the vernacular neighborhood architecture. St. Francis Xavier School The parish school is located at 1711 Haight Avenue and has students from New Beginnings to Eighth Grade. Following the parish's founding in 1928, Fr. Kearney founded the school in 1929, which was initially housed in the \\"portable\\" (temporary) auditorium building. The school first opened on September 15, 1930; the first principal was Miss Helen Kelly. Ground was broken for a permanent, eight- classroom school building on April 11, 1937, which was then staffed by the Sisters of Mercy. An annex for that building was begun in 1955. The school has between 325 and 370 students. Music The organ at St. Francis Xavier Church was designed in 1951 by the Kilgen Organ Company, successor firm to Geo. Kilgen & Sons of St. Louis, Mo.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands on a hillside by the A16 road as it passes through the village. History In the Norman era the Benedictine Burwell Priory was built near the site of the church. It is thought that St Michael's was built adjacent to the monastic buildings. It dates from the early 12th century. The chancel was added during the following century. The tower originated in the early 16th century, and additions were made to its upper stage in the late 18th century. The south porch was also built in the late 18th century. Other additions and alterations were made in the late 15th century, and in the 19th century. In 1911 the church was restored, and during that century buttresses were built to support the south wall of the nave. In May 1981 it was declared redundant. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in green sandstone rubble with limestone ashlar dressings, and some red brick. The roofs are lead with some slate. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave with a south porch, a chancel and a west tower. The tower is in three stages on a plinth, with buttresses. Above the southwest buttress is a sundial. On the west side is a doorway, over which is a three-light window extending from the bottom to the middle stage. Above this window is a clock face. On the south side of the middle stage is a small lancet window. In the top stage there are bell openings on all sides. While most of the tower is built in stone, part of the top stage and the parapet are in brick. The top of the tower is battlemented with stone copings. The upper parts of the nave walls are also in brick. In the north wall is a 15th-century rectangular three-light window, and a 20th-century two-light casement window. There is a single lancet window in the north wall of the chancel, and the east window has three lights. In the south wall of the chancel is a rectangular three-light window. Set against the wall beneath this is a table tomb dating from the late 18th century, carved with a skull and laurels. Along the south walls of the nave are two buttresses and four blocked arcades, the two towards the east being larger than the other two. The larger two arcades each contains a three- light window, and against the smaller arcades is a gabled porch. =Interior= The tower arch dates from the 15th century and has a pointed head. The chancel arch is Norman, and has a semicircular head. The capitals are carved, on one side with dancing stags, and on the other with volutes. Above the chancel arch is the fragment of a wall painting depicting a crowned head and the initial \\"M\\". It has been suggested that this represents either Queen Maud, or Margaret of Navarre. In the roof of the tower are carvings of three elongated wingless angels. The oak altar rail dates from the late 19th century, and is ornately carved with grapes and vine leaves. The reredos is also from the 19th century and consists of five arched panels containing tracery. The 15th-century font is octagonal and is carved with shields in panels. The pine pulpit is from the 17th century. Dating from the 19th century are the pews, a dado rail, and a piscina. In the church are a number of memorials. One of these, dated 1674, is in marble and includes a segmental pediment and carved festoons, a cartouche, cherubs and drapery. There are further marble memorials dating from the 18th and 19th centuries.

The partly 11th-century cruciform building, set in an almost deserted village in a loop of the River Arun, is mostly unrestored and stands on an ancient earthwork which has pre-Christian origins. The building has architectural features and internal fittings spanning hundreds of years, including some very old stained glass and wall paintings, although there are few memorials compared with other Sussex churches of a similar age. The church, \\"movingly eloquent of centuries of remote Sussex agricultural life\\", is no longer used for worship: it was declared redundant in 1992, after which it was entrusted to the Churches Conservation Trust. English Heritage lists the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. History The village of North Stoke, now much smaller than in previous centuries, sits opposite South Stoke ‚Äî with which it is linked by a path across the River Arun. Road access between the two places requires an drive around Arundel Park and down a long dead-end track from Houghton. Access is also possible along a downland path from nearby Burpham. A church here was mentioned at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. It is likely to have been a Saxon wooden church. Later in the 11th century the present nave may have been built over its foundations. The tall, wide structure has a single window on each side (north and south), and lacks side aisles. The next addition was a mid 13th-century Early English Gothic chancel; its north and south lancet windows give an indication of how church windows had developed since Norman times. In about 1290 the building was made cruciform by the addition of north and south transepts. That on the north side was built so it could bear a tower, but this addition was never made. Instead a belfry was added, \\"astonishingly situated astride the ridge\\" of its roof according to Nikolaus Pevsner. The transept wings have windows with Decorated Gothic tracery, showing a further evolution in window design. Also in about 1290 the church was given some small stained glass windows depicting the Coronation of the Virgin. This represents a very early example by Sussex standards, dating from a period when stained glasswork was moving from the grisaille style and the basic Tree of Jesse towards Biblical figures. The nave and chancel were structurally divided in the early 14th century by a horseshoe-shaped chancel arch built of clunch and covered with elaborate decorative mouldings. The remains of a contemporary wall painting are visible above it, and on each side there is a recess‚Äîthe left-hand one of which has a carving of a human hand on its corbel. The wall paintings, depicting flowers and foliage, are said to have inspired the 16th-century local artist Lambert Barnard in his designs for the vaults at nearby Boxgrove Priory and Chichester Cathedral. Unlike many churches in Sussex, North Stoke Church was not restored during the 19th century, although Philip Mainwaring Johnston undertook some work in 1910 and the east window in the chancel is a modern replacement. In particular, the simple timber roof design has lasted for more than 700 years without the need for alteration. The timberwork is clearly visible in the nave and south transept in particular. On 1 March 1992 the Diocese of Chichester declared the church redundant. From the same date, under the provisions of Section 50 of the Pastoral Measure 1983, it was placed into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund (now the Churches Conservation Trust). The Trust administers five former churches in West Sussex; the others are at Chichester, Church Norton, Tortington and Warminghurst. The church is open for visitors every day. The chancel sits behind a gate giving access to the churchyard. Under its former name of North Stoke Church, the building was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 15 March 1955. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of 38 Grade I listed buildings, and 1,726 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Horsham. In late 2007 two amateur archaeologists on an ecclesiastical archaeology course at the University of Sussex unexpectedly found an ancient document giving the dedication of the church, which had been unknown since the English Reformation or before. Tony and Lesley Voice were examining documents at The National Archives in Kew, London, when they found a piece of vellum stuck to the back of one. It was a letter written by the Bishop of Chichester Stephen Bersted to King Edward I in 1275, indicating that the church was dedicated to Mary the Virgin. Accordingly, a rededication ceremony was held at the now redundant church on 8 December 2007, at which it was officially renamed from North Stoke Church to St Mary the Virgin Church. Other discoveries made at the same time included the involvement of William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel in the medieval life of the church. The parish of St. Mary the Virgin has been combined with that of St Michael and All Angels, Amberley. This parish now has the legal name Amberley with North Stoke. This is part of a benefice that also includes the churches of Greatham, Parham and Wiggonholt. Architecture and fittings Flint and stone are the main building materials. font from about 1200, carved from local stone. St Mary the Virgin Church is a simple two-cell structure built during three periods. Its nave is 11th-century; a chancel was added early in the 13th century; and transepts were built on the north and south sides later in that century. The north transept was buttressed and built with a more square shape in anticipation of a tower being built on top, but this did not happen and a small belfry surmounts it instead. The church is built of locally quarried flint and stone. The interior is plainly decorated and light, with mostly plain glass and whitewashed walls. Its \\"delightfully unrestored\\" appearance gives it a \\"timeless atmosphere\\". The main structural features are a simple timber roof with exposed beams and a more intricately decorated chancel arch of the early 14th century, built of clunch. A notable architectural feature of the church is the wide variety of window designs that have survived (\\"a history in miniature of window architecture\\"): Norman slits with crude lancet heads give way to taller lancets with Early English Gothic and Decorated Gothic tracery, and later wide lancets. Six styles of window have been identified overall. The three-light east window, the only modern replacement, was put in after its predecessor's tracery gradually disappeared over the centuries. Although most of the glass is clear, the stained glass that does survive is very old and in good condition‚Äîalthough some has been reset and is no longer in its original position. Internal fittings include a mid 13th-century piscina which is joined to three sedilia by continuous moulded scrollwork. Above this, two blocked archways rise and meet at a corbel carved with a sheep's head. This may be Norman and could have come from elsewhere in the church. There are also carvings representing monks' heads supporting statues. Apart from the main piscina, two others survive elsewhere in the church, suggesting that there may have been two subsidiary altars at one point. The principal monuments in the church are six stone slabs set into the chancel floor and dating from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and a two-colour marble tablet on the chancel wall in memory of three members of the Sayres family who died between 1809 and 1820. The latter is reminiscent of the Regency style. The churchyard has very few stones or markers, although three with carved crosses have been identified as late 13th-century. The oldest fixture is a \\"tub-like\\" stone font with a lead bowl, dating from between 1200 and 1250 and standing at the west end of the church. The wide bowl is supported on a thin pillar and has little decoration. Its shape is reminiscent of a chalice, and it was carved from sandstone quarried at nearby Pulborough.

Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop. Traditional SQL queries must be implemented in the MapReduce Java API to execute SQL applications and queries over distributed data. Hive provides the necessary SQL abstraction to integrate SQL-like queries (HiveQL) into the underlying Java without the need to implement queries in the low-level Java API. Since most data warehousing applications work with SQL-based querying languages, Hive aids portability of SQL-based applications to Hadoop. While initially developed by Facebook, Apache Hive is used and developed by other companies such as Netflix and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).Use Case Study of Hive/Hadoop Amazon maintains a software fork of Apache Hive included in Amazon Elastic MapReduce on Amazon Web Services.Amazon Elastic MapReduce Developer Guide Features Apache Hive supports analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop's HDFS and compatible file systems such as Amazon S3 filesystem and Alluxio. It provides a SQL-like query language called HiveQLHiveQL Language Manual with schema on read and transparently converts queries to MapReduce, Apache TezApache Tez and Spark jobs. All three execution engines can run in Hadoop's resource negotiator, YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). To accelerate queries, it provides indexes, including bitmap indexes.Working with Students to Improve Indexing in Apache Hive Other features of Hive include: * Indexing to provide acceleration, index type including compaction and bitmap index as of 0.10, more index types are planned. * Different storage types such as plain text, RCFile, HBase, ORC, and others. * Metadata storage in a relational database management system, significantly reducing the time to perform semantic checks during query execution. * Operating on compressed data stored into the Hadoop ecosystem using algorithms including DEFLATE, BWT, snappy, etc. * Built-in user-defined functions (UDFs) to manipulate dates, strings, and other data-mining tools. Hive supports extending the UDF set to handle use-cases not supported by built-in functions. * SQL-like queries (HiveQL), which are implicitly converted into MapReduce or Tez, or Spark jobs. By default, Hive stores metadata in an embedded Apache Derby database, and other client/server databases like MySQL can optionally be used. The first four file formats supported in Hive were plain text,Optimising Hadoop and Big Data with Text and HiveOptimising Hadoop and Big Data with Text and Hive sequence file, optimized row columnar (ORC) format and RCFile. Apache Parquet can be read via plugin in versions later than 0.10 and natively starting at 0.13. Additional Hive plugins support querying of the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Architecture  Major components of the Hive architecture are: * Metastore: Stores metadata for each of the tables such as their schema and location. It also includes the partition metadata which helps the driver to track the progress of various data sets distributed over the cluster. The data is stored in a traditional RDBMS format. The metadata helps the driver to keep track of the data and it is crucial. Hence, a backup server regularly replicates the data which can be retrieved in case of data loss. * Driver: Acts like a controller which receives the HiveQL statements. It starts the execution of the statement by creating sessions, and monitors the life cycle and progress of the execution. It stores the necessary metadata generated during the execution of a HiveQL statement. The driver also acts as a collection point of data or query results obtained after the Reduce operation. * Compiler: Performs compilation of the HiveQL query, which converts the query to an execution plan. This plan contains the tasks and steps needed to be performed by the Hadoop MapReduce to get the output as translated by the query. The compiler converts the query to an abstract syntax tree (AST). After checking for compatibility and compile time errors, it converts the AST to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG divides operators to MapReduce stages and tasks based on the input query and data. * Optimizer: Performs various transformations on the execution plan to get an optimized DAG. Transformations can be aggregated together, such as converting a pipeline of joins to a single join, for better performance. It can also split the tasks, such as applying a transformation on data before a reduce operation, to provide better performance and scalability. However, the logic of transformation used for optimization used can be modified or pipelined using another optimizer. * Executor: After compilation and optimization, the executor executes the tasks. It interacts with the job tracker of Hadoop to schedule tasks to be run. It takes care of pipelining the tasks by making sure that a task with dependency gets executed only if all other prerequisites are run. * CLI, UI, and Thrift Server: A command-line interface (CLI) provides a user interface for an external user to interact with Hive by submitting queries, instructions and monitoring the process status. Thrift server allows external clients to interact with Hive over a network, similar to the JDBC or ODBC protocols. HiveQL While based on SQL, HiveQL does not strictly follow the full SQL-92 standard. HiveQL offers extensions not in SQL, including multitable inserts and create table as select, but only offers basic support for indexes. HiveQL lacked support for transactions and materialized views, and only limited subquery support.Hive Language Manual Support for insert, update, and delete with full ACID functionality was made available with release 0.14.ACID and Transactions in Hive Internally, a compiler translates HiveQL statements into a directed acyclic graph of MapReduce, Tez, or Spark jobs, which are submitted to Hadoop for execution. = Example = The word count program counts the number of times each word occurs in the input. The word count can be written in HiveQL as: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS docs; CREATE TABLE docs (line STRING); LOAD DATA INPATH 'input_file' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE docs; CREATE TABLE word_counts AS SELECT word, count(1) AS count FROM (SELECT explode(split(line, 's')) AS word FROM docs) temp GROUP BY word ORDER BY word; A brief explanation of each of the statements is as follows: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS docs; CREATE TABLE docs (line STRING); Checks if table \`docs\` exists and drops it if it does. Creates a new table called \`docs\` with a single column of type \`STRING\` called \`line\`. LOAD DATA INPATH 'input_file' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE docs; Loads the specified file or directory (In this case ‚Äúinput_file‚Äù) into the table. \`OVERWRITE\` specifies that the target table to which the data is being loaded into is to be re-written; Otherwise the data would be appended. CREATE TABLE word_counts AS SELECT word, count(1) AS count FROM (SELECT explode(split(line, 's')) AS word FROM docs) temp GROUP BY word ORDER BY word; The query creates a table called \`word_counts\` with two columns: \`word\` and \`count\`. This query draws its input from the inner query . This query serves to split the input words into different rows of a temporary table aliased as \`temp\`. The groups the results based on their keys. This results in the \`count\` column holding the number of occurrences for each word of the \`word\` column. The sorts the words alphabetically.  Comparison with traditional databases  The storage and querying operations of Hive closely resemble those of traditional databases. While Hive is a SQL dialect, there are a lot of differences in structure and working of Hive in comparison to relational databases. The differences are mainly because Hive is built on top of the Hadoop ecosystem, and has to comply with the restrictions of Hadoop and MapReduce. A schema is applied to a table in traditional databases. In such traditional databases, the table typically enforces the schema when the data is loaded into the table. This enables the database to make sure that the data entered follows the representation of the table as specified by the table definition. This design is called schema on write. In comparison, Hive does not verify the data against the table schema on write. Instead, it subsequently does run time checks when the data is read. This model is called schema on read. The two approaches have their own advantages and drawbacks. Checking data against table schema during the load time adds extra overhead, which is why traditional databases take a longer time to load data. Quality checks are performed against the data at the load time to ensure that the data is not corrupt. Early detection of corrupt data ensures early exception handling. Since the tables are forced to match the schema after/during the data load, it has better query time performance. Hive, on the other hand, can load data dynamically without any schema check, ensuring a fast initial load, but with the drawback of comparatively slower performance at query time. Hive does have an advantage when the schema is not available at the load time, but is instead generated later dynamically. Transactions are key operations in traditional databases. As any typical RDBMS, Hive supports all four properties of transactions (ACID): Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Transactions in Hive were introduced in Hive 0.13 but were only limited to the partition level. Recent version of Hive 0.14 were these functions fully added to support complete ACID properties. Hive 0.14 and later provides different row level transactions such as INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE. Enabling INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE transactions require setting appropriate values for configuration properties such as \`hive.support.concurrency\`, \`hive.enforce.bucketing\`, and \`hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode\`. Security Hive v0.7.0 added integration with Hadoop security. Hadoop began using Kerberos authorization support to provide security. Kerberos allows for mutual authentication between client and server. In this system, the client's request for a ticket is passed along with the request. The previous versions of Hadoop had several issues such as users being able to spoof their username by setting the \`hadoop.job.ugi\` property and also MapReduce operations being run under the same user: hadoop or mapred. With Hive v0.7.0's integration with Hadoop security, these issues have largely been fixed. TaskTracker jobs are run by the user who launched it and the username can no longer be spoofed by setting the \`hadoop.job.ugi\` property. Permissions for newly created files in Hive are dictated by the HDFS. The Hadoop distributed file system authorization model uses three entities: user, group and others with three permissions: read, write and execute. The default permissions for newly created files can be set by changing the umask value for the Hive configuration variable \`hive.files.umask.value\`.

Life and career Under his father's tutelage and his mother's large record collection, George learned very quickly how to play with a band and at 7 years old, made his first public performance at the Goodlett Elementary School carnival in Memphis. During high school, George played in rock bands and cut his teeth playing blues on Beale Street and sitting in with luminaries like B. B. King. He graduated in 1986 from Overton High School in Memphis, where he sang second tenor in the concert choir and played drums for their award winning gospel choir. After graduation, George put together a blues trio with his father, \\"Big George\\" and guitarist, Joe Hardin called, Triple Threat but the name was short lived and changed to TBC (Tennessee Blues Connection). In early 1987, he auditioned for Albert King's band and joined the blues artist for one month, opening shows for B. B. King, Waylon Jennings and Carl Perkins. From 1988 until 1991, he toured the southeast college circuit with two rock-n-roll bands, Big Fish & the Crime. In July 1991, George moved to San Diego, California and while there played with Billy Bacon & The Forbidden Pigs, Robin Henkel, Eric Lieberman, Billy Watson, the cat Mary, Sha Na Na & Robert Walter's 20th Congress, touring all over North America and Japan. Spending three years drumming with the cat Mary, George recorded on several of the group's albums, the most critically acclaimed one was Her High, Lonesome Days (Orchard Music Group). With Sha Na Na he recorded on two of their albums, Live in Japan (Sony Japan) and Rockin‚Äô Christmas (The Gold Label). During this time, he also recorded with Robert Walter‚Äôs 20th Congress on Giving Up the Ghost (Magnatude Records), Gary Jules‚Äô multi-platinum album Trading Snake Oil for Wolftickets (Universal Music Group), and on a tune with singer Judith Owen for the soundtrack to the film, As Good as It Gets (Sony). George moved to New York City in May 2003 and for three months played with the late soul jazz guitarist Melvin Sparks. In September 2003, George joined Jacksonville, Florida.-based JJ Grey & Mofro, a relationship that lasted five years. During his time with Mofro, George recorded on three of the band‚Äôs albums and toured North America, Europe & Australia. In early March 2005, he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana but when Hurricane Katrina hit the city in September of that year, he moved to Austin, Texas. He stayed in Austin for 10 months and during that time met soul singer Ruthie Foster and recorded drums on her album, The Phenomenal Ruthie Foster (Blue Corn), produced by Malcolm \\"Papa Mali\\" Welbourne, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Blues chart. George came back to Memphis in July 2006 and soon joined up with organist Al Gamble, guitarist Joe Restivo and saxophonist Art Edmaiston to form the boogaloo instrumental band The Grip. The Grip recorded an EP for Archer Records titled Grab This Thing. Edmaiston joined JJ Grey & Mofro and both he and George toured together in the band for one year, until George left the group in March 2008. When Mofro's touring schedule picked up and Edmaiston left to go on the road, the three remaining members of The Grip changed the band‚Äôs name to The City Champs and played regular gigs in Memphis, including The Buccaneer Lounge. The Tuesday night sessions caught the ear of Memphis producer Scott Bomar who decided to record the band and ultimately released their first album on his Electraphonic Records label. In 2008, working alongside Bomar, George and Al Gamble played on the score for the film, Gospel Hill, which stars Angela Bassett, Giancarlo Esposito, Danny Glover, Julia Stiles and Samuel L. Jackson. The City Champs' first album, The Safecracker, received rave reviews from critics worldwide. In February 2010, The City Champs were asked to join The North Mississippi Allstars on a U.S. tour, during which they opened the shows, as well as sat-in with the band during their sets. Also in 2010, The City Champs took part in the filming of a music documentary titled Take Me To The River, March 2014. This Cody Dickinson and Martin Shore-produced film showcases Memphis music legends recording with younger Memphis artists. The City Champs teamed up with Memphis harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite and renowned Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section bassist, David Hood to film a segment for this project. In November 2010, The City Champs once again teamed with Scott Bomar and released their second album The Set-Up (Electraphonic). The Set-Up includes instrumental original music by the band, plus a cover of RJD2‚Äôs A Beautiful Mine (the theme to AMC TV‚Äôs Mad Men). Some tracks on The Set-Up also include horn players Marc Franklin, Jim Spake, Kirk Smothers and Memphis percussionist, Felix Hernandez. Motown legend Jack Ashford of The Funk Brothers, contributed tambourine to the recording, as well. The Champs' music has been featured in the MTV series $5 Cover and in the Emmy Award-winning documentary film I Am a Man: From Memphis, A Lesson in Life. In December 2010, George received a phone call from Black Crowes front man, Chris Robinson, who asked him to come to Los Angeles and play drums with his new group, Chris Robinson Brotherhood. Robinson had been given a copy of The Set-Up from Sluppick's longtime friend and Crowes' guitarist, Luther Dickinson. In February 2011, George produced and played drums on soul singer Billy Seward's debut record, Better Place, released in August 2011. George toured with the Brotherhood from March 2011 to January 2015 and recorded three studio albums with them, Big Moon Ritual, The Magic Door & Phosphorescent Harvest and two live albums, Betty's Blends, Volume's 1 & 2 (Silver Arrow Records).

The current pastor of St. John Chrysostom Church is Rev. Richard Marrano.  Description  The double-height-over-sunken-basement brick twin-towered church with stone trim was built at 985 East 167th Street and Hoe Avenue in 1900. The church front elevation is symmetrically divided into three parts and consists of a nave with six-bay clerestory flanked to both sides by six-bay lean-to aisles, which terminate in the bookended square-in-plan single-bay four-stage towers, projecting a bay in depth to flank the gabled three-bay fa√ßade of the nave. The central gabled fa√ßade has three equal round-headed entrance openings addressed by a flight of stone steps spanning between the towers. Pitched nave roof with pyramidal copper roofs with cross finials to towers. Walling has reddish-yellow-brick over rusticated stone splayed plinth/basement walling and a corbelled-stone-over-round-headed-arcade-band of brick. Openings all are round-headed with moulded stone architraves and reveals, some with stop-block-labeled hoodmoulds, except basement openings are openings, which are pointed-arched. Gabled center of main fa√ßade has blind stone arcade to mid-height; entrance openings flanked with moulded responds and continuous imposts continued through entrance opening as transoms, with double-leaf timber paneled doors. Stained-glass tympanum overlights to entrances; gable apex features stained-glass rose window; copper cross finial above. Each exposed tower elevation has single window with hood to first stage; bipartite window with hood to second stage; blind oculus to third stage; and tripartite with hood and painted timber louvers to (belfry) fourth stage, which is above cornice level and has slightly setback corners. The seven-bay four-story orange brick schoolhouse with stone trim was built 1914. Main fa√ßade is detailed with central three-bay breakfront that to ground floor is accentuated in four-centre-arched stone entrances. Ground-floor is double- height and defined from rest of structure with separating stone stringcourse and second floor sillcourse. A modillioned cornice conceals its roof. Windows are square-headed bipartite timber sashes with stone sills and lintels.  St. John Chrysostom's School  The parish also operates a Catholic grammar school at 1144 Hoe Ave, diagonally across Hoe avenue and 167th Street, and adjacent to the church's rectory. The Dominican Sisters of Sparkill have staffed the parish school since its opening in 1914. In the 1940s, enrollment was over a thousand. Presently, the school has around 600 students with approximately two sections per grade.Bronx Catholic Blog (Accessed 7 February 2011)  References   External links  * St. John Chrysostom School's website Religious organizations established in 1899 Roman Catholic churches in the Bronx Roman Catholic churches completed in 1900 Romanesque Revival church buildings in New York City Italianate architecture in New York City Educational institutions established in 1914 Private middle schools in the Bronx Catholic elementary schools in the Bronx Morrisania, Bronx ","title":"St. John Chrysostom's Church (Bronx)"},{"id":"30248573","text":"Love Revolution may refer to: Albums * Love Revolution (NewSong album, 1997 * Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album), 2003 * Love Revolution (Natalie Grant album), 2010 *It Is Time for a Love Revolution, an album by Lenny Kravitz =Songs= *\\"Love Revolution\\", song from It Is Time for a Love Revolution (Lenny Kravitz album) *\\"Love Revolution\\", song from Love Revolution (Natalie Grant album) *\\"Love Revolution\\", song from Love Revolution (NewSong album *\\"Love Revolution\\", song from Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album) *\\"Love Revolution\\", song by Army of Lovers from Disco Extravaganza *Love Revolution (Will Young song) Will Young 2015 *\\"Love Revolution\\", Pat Hodges With The Sweet Inspirations *\\"Love Revolution\\" (Phixx song) No.13 charting single by Phixx 2004 =Films= *Love Revolution (web series), South Korean drama web series, 2020 \\"Love Revolution\\" in other languages *Love Revolution, a Japanese drama aired in 2001 ","title":"Love Revolution"},{"id":"30248633","text":"The South American snapping turtle (Chelydra acutirostris) is a species of turtle in the family Chelydridae.

The documentary is the continuation of Eye of the Day and Shape of the Moon and follows again the Sjamsuddin family, consisting of three generations, living in the slums of Jakarta, Indonesia. Writers *Leonard Retel Helmrich *Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich Plot The film follows a family in transition as they adjust to bewildering gaps in education, outlook, religion and even class among three generations jammed into cramped quarters in Jakarta. At the head of the family the shiftless Bakti gambles incessantly with his Siamese fighting fish while his frustrated wife, Sri, runs a small food stall, and his orphaned niece, Tari, cares more about obtaining blue contact lenses than preparing for her high school graduation.New York Times: Review: Position Among the Stars Tari emerges as the family's star as the tumult of democracy and corruption grip the country. Tari has the possibility that she may be the first in her family to experience higher education. She passes her final examination. With a mortgage on the home, they finance her university study. Her uncle Bakti quarrels with his wife. He uses holy water for his fighting fish, and she takes revenge by cooking them. Dwi (Baktis brother) is upset after their mother Rumijah has taught her little grandson Bagus a Christian prayer since the boy is raised by Dwi as a Muslim. There is a near fire as the family converts from cooking with oil to cheaper gas. Bakti drags the poor grandmother Rumijah back from life in her ancestral village to take charge of the youngster and expose Tari to traditional values in the run-up to her graduation and application to college.The Hollywood Reporter: Sundance Review: Position Among the StarsThe Guardian: Review: Position Among the Stars Background Leonard Retel Helmrich observed the fortunes of the Sjamsuddin family living in a Jakarta slum for twelve years. The result is a trilogy, covering the topics economy, politics and religion in Indonesia. Moreover, every part stands for an own tense : the past, the present and the future of the country. Yet, each film stands on its own, so they don't have to be watched subsequently. While the tumultuous changes that have rocked Indonesian society swirl around the family, of course, more than anything Retel Helmrich has intimately captured a family in transition as they adjust to bewildering gaps in education, outlook, religion and even class among three generations jammed into cramped quarters.

Early life and career  Born in Somerset, Ohio, he attended schools in Zanesville, Ohio, and St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the bar in the State of Ohio in January 1881 and practiced law in Ohio for the next five years with the exception of nine months spent working on a newspaper in Gunnison, Colorado, from May 1881 to March 1882.Supreme Court of Ohio, Order Book No. 7, January 4, 1881.Gunnison News-Democrat, June 20, 1881, p. 3, and Zanesville Signal, March 11, 1882, p. 3. On October 16, 1884, he married Letie Abbot of Zanesville; they would have ten children.  Territorial judicial service  Maginnis, who was active in the Democratic Party, was appointed Chief Justice of Wyoming by President Grover Cleveland in October 1886.Washington Post, October 13, 1886, p. 1. During his term as Chief Justice, Maginnis took part in decisions involving land, water, cattle, railroads, and other issues reflecting Wyoming's economy. His criticism of the powerful Wyoming Stock Growers Association and his position in a case threatening cattlemen-politicians Francis E. Warren and Joseph M. Carey (United States v. Douglas-Willan Sartoris Company, 3 Wyo. 287; 22 P. 92) made him a somewhat controversial figure.Michael O'Neill, \\"The Removal of Chief Justice Maginnis: Politics and the Judiciary in Wyoming Territory.\\" Annals of Wyoming, 79:3-4 (Summer-Autumn 2007), pp. 50-72. Like other territories, Wyoming had three supreme court justices, who also served as district court judges, the latter function taking most of their time. Maginnis's district was the eastern third of Wyoming, including Cheyenne (Laramie County). The trial court work included divorce, robbery, murder, rustling, and other criminal and civil cases. In one such case, in Sundance (Crook County), on August 5, 1887, Maginnis sentenced to 18 months in prison a young horse thief, Harry Longabaugh, who later became famous as \\"the Sundance Kid.\\"Sundance Gazette, August 12, 1887, p. 8; and August 5, 1887, Journal, August Term, 1887, District Court, Crook County, Wyoming, p. 64.  Removal and final years  Of the 16 men who served on the Wyoming Territory Supreme Court between 1869 and 1890, Maginnis was the only justice who was removed. Although he had been appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate for a four-year term, his tenure was in jeopardy after Cleveland's defeat by Republican Benjamin Harrison in November 1888. During the next several months there were extensive discussions and representations in Wyoming and Washington, D.C., about a possible successor to Maginnis. Shortly after taking office in March 1889, Harrison began removing territorial governors, secretaries, and judges appointed by his Democratic predecessor.Earl S. Pomeroy, The Territories and the United States, 1861-1890: Studies in Colonial Administration (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1969), p. 72. In June 1889, the new U.S. Attorney General sent an examiner, James W. Nightingale, to review several territorial offices, including that of Clerk of the First District Court in Cheyenne. This position was occupied by Luke Murrin, former Civil War officer, first mayor of Cheyenne, saloon keeper, and prominent Democrat, who had been appointed by Maginnis. Nightingale found several administrative and financial failings in Murrin's work and implicated Maginnis. Nightingale's lengthy reportJames W. Nightingale to William H. H.

On August 30, Harrison approved the removal, and on August 31 he appointed a new chief justice, Willis Van Devanter, a Cheyenne attorney and close associate of the newly appointed Republican Governor Warren and Republican Congressional Delegate Carey. Van Devanter went on to become an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Maginnis left office on October 1, 1889, and on the same day moved with his family to Ogden, Utah, where he engaged in private law practice and also served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for Utah, appointed in 1893 by the newly re-elected President Cleveland.\\"Utah Appointments,\\" Ogden Standard, May 27, 1893, p. 1.

Immediately from 1906 on, construction of a permanent church with parochial buildings on Andrews Avenue and Fordham Road commenced. The complex would consist of a two-story \\"combination building,\\" a parochial school-over-church building, along with a separate rectory. Monsignor J. F. Mooney, V.G. laid the cornerstone on 15 July 1906. the church was dedicated by Archbishop (later Cardinal) Farley on 15 September 1907. In 1914, the property was valued at $135,000. By 1914, the University Avenue and Fordham Road property that the present church stands on was purchased and being prepared. The present Collegiate Gothic church structure was built 1927 to the designs of Delaney, O'Connor & Schultz. The building has been incorrectly dated by other sources to the 1950s and early 1900s. On March 5, 2010, a suspicious two-alarm blaze filled the sanctuary with flames and smoke. \\"The fire started in a former confessional-turned-storage room in the vestibule of the church, blocking the main entrance.\\" The Rev.

Despite the fire, church services were resumed at the parish school's gym, adjacent to the church. The parish is still staffed by the Augustinian friars. St. Nicholas of Tolentine Elementary School The parochial school, which opened in 1907, was run by the Augustinian Fathers and the Sisters of Charity. In 1914, the school was run by 2 Sisters of Charity and 1 lay teacher. The school had 45 male and 45 female pupils. The original school was over the church, and took over the whole building when the present church building was completed in 1927.

The Grace Contract was not actually formalized until 1890.  Debt  The Peruvian government was deep in debt after winning independence from Spain and the War of the Pacific. To settle these debts the government had secured several loans, primarily through Dreyfus Fr√©rale and the Guano Syndicate. Loans were secured in 1865, 1866, 1869, 1870, and 1872. Proceeds from the massive ¬£36,800,000 1872 loan were to be used to retire the 1865 and 1866 loans. There were issues concerning the legality of this loan as the Peruvian government had reportedly authorized President Balta to raise only ¬£9.3 million so the 1866 and 1866 loan repayment was not authorized. The London Stock Exchange Committee intervened and restricted the loan to the amount authorized. In August 1872, Manuel Pardo became president and was a member of the anti-Dreyfus campaign in 1869. From 1872 until 1875 relations between the government and the Syndicate deteriorated and on December 18, 1875, Peru defaulted on bond payments, and normal payments were never resumed.

Moves to address the Peruvian financial crisis included the Elias-Castellon and Irigoyen-Delgado-Donoughmore protocols, that were formalized by 1890.

Parish The parish of St. Raymond's predates the creation of The Bronx, when the area was still part of southern Westchester County, New York. Bishop John Dubois of New York had a deed executed on 2 December 1835 at a cost of $160 for the 125 foot by 26 foot plot of land situated about two miles north of Fort Schuyler, New York. A church and/or school were intended to be constructed that year on the plot of land, however, nothing was erected. In 1842, Bishop John Hughes purchased the acre that the current St. Raymond's Church is located on, and converted an old wooden barn into a temporary church. In 1847 an adjoining acre was purchased. The land purchased coincided with the 1840 founding of St. John's College in the village of Fordham, the future Fordham University. In 1842 Fr. Felix Vilanis, Superior at St. John's, was appointed to attend to the people of Westchester and the villages along the Sound. He built the first church and had it dedicated 31 August 1845. After the Mass, Bishop Hughes blessed the cemetery which had been laid out adjoining the church. By 1850, St. Raymond's was responsible for had nine mission churches in the Bronx. Due to a shortage of priests and poor roads it was not possible to say Mass at each mission chapel every week, so the priests rode circuit visiting each in turn.\\"Church of St. Raymond\\", NYC AGO In 1865 the Catholic Protectory, an orphanage organized for the protection of destitute Catholic children purchased 114 acres of nearby farmland with several barns.

The boys learned shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, wheelwrighting, farming, and gardening. The girls learned to embroider, cook and make gloves. The institution was an integral part of the parish until it was sold in 1938. Bronx Historical Society Among the notable pastors were the Rev.

McEvoy (pastor from 1875 to 1885), bought the Underhill Farm on Throgg's Neck and had it consecrated for burial purpose as St. Raymond's Cemetery, one of the borough's notable cemeteries. Buildings The original Church became too small and many parishioners had to stand at Mass because it was over capacity. On August 4, 1897, ground was broken for the new Church, designed in the Byzantine Revival-style. The architect of St. Raymond Church was George H.

Unlike species of Geomyces, P. destructans forms asymmetrically curved conidia. Pseudogymnoascus destructans grows very slowly on artificial media and cannot grow at temperatures above 20 ¬∞C. It can grow around 4 ¬∞C to 20 ¬∞C, which encompasses the temperatures found in winter bat hibernacula. Phylogenic evaluation has revealed this organism should be reclassified under the family Pseudeurotiaceae, changing its name to Pseudogymnoascus destructans. History In 2008, Blehert et al. described the fungus associated with white-nose syndrome as a member of the genus Geomyces. In 2009, Gargas et al. were the first to describe the fungus as a unique species; the specific name they chose, \\"'\\", means \\"destroying\\". The fungus was definitively identified as the cause of the syndrome in bats, according to research published in 2011 by scientists at the United States Geological Survey. It was previously unknown whether this fungus was the primary cause of WNS or was an opportunistic pathogen associated with the disease, though strong evidence suggested that the fungus was the etiologic agent. In 2013, an analysis of the phylogenetic relationship indicated that this fungus was more closely related to the genus Pseudogymnoascus than to the genus Geomyces changing its Latin binomial to Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Distribution Pseudogymnoascus destructans is believed to originate from Europe. The current P. destructans European distribution includes Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The North American geographic distribution of P. destructans continues to increase each year since its initial introduction to New York State in 2006. Its current distribution includes 38 states in the U.S.A. and at least 7 Canadian provinces. Bat species affected by P. destructans In North America, P. destructans has been found to infect at least eleven species of bats, of which it has caused diagnostic symptoms of white-nose syndrome in the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), the endangered gray bat (Myotis grisescens), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), the tri- colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), and the eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii). Pseudogymnoascus destructans has been found on four additional North American bat species: the endangered Virginia big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus), the cave bat (Myotis velifer), the Silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans), and the South-eastern bat (Myotis austroriparius). The European bat species that have been shown to harbour P. destructans include Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii), Lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii oxygnathus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii), pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii), Greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis), whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus), Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), Northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii), Lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros), Barbastell (Barbastella barbastellus), Brown long- eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri), although large-scale European bat related fatalities are not reported. Biology Typical grey colony of Pseudogymnoascus destructans on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Pseudogymnoascus destructans in culture demonstrating characteristic curved conidia in blue/purple. (false color SEM image) P. destructans is a psycrophilic fungus, able to grow below and with an upper limit near . This fungus produces brown and grey colonies, secretes a brownish pigment and reproduces asexually via characteristically curved conidia when cultured on Sabaouraud dextrose agar. The asymmetrically curved conidia are produced at the tips or sides singly or in short chains. Arthroconidia can be present and undergo rhexolytic separation. Research has shown that P. destructans grows optimally between , with an upper growth limit of about . The in vitro growth rate of P. destructans is reported to be very slow; however, several studies have shown that not all P. destructans isolates grow at the same rate. P. destructans grows as an opportunistic pathogen on bats, causing white-nose syndrome, but it can also persist in the cave environment, as a saprotroph. P. destructans can grow and sporulate (reproduce asexually via conidiation) on keratinaceous, chitinaceous, cellulosic, and lipid/protein rich substrates including dead fish, mushroom fruit bodies and dead insects. P. destructans has been shown to utilize many nitrogen sources: nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, and uric acid. Although P. destructans can penetrate senescing moss cells, cellulosic debris may not be a long term substrate for colonization. P. destructans can tolerate elevated levels of environmental inhibitory sulfur compounds (cysteine, sulfite, and sulfide), grow over a wide pH range (pH 5-11), tolerate elevated environmental levels of calcium; however, P. destructans was found to be intolerant to matric-induced water stress. =Enzymatic activity= Pseudogymnoascus destructans demonstrating lipase activity on Rhodamine B agar. Under laboratory conditions, P. destructans has been shown to produce numerous enzymes including Œ≤-glucosidase, esterase/esterase lipase/lipase, leucine and valine arylamidase, N-acetyl-Œ≤- glucosaminidase, naphthol-AS-B1-phosphohydrolase, both acid and alkaline phosphatases, various proteinase, and urease, while testing negative for cystine arylamidase, Œ±-chymotrypsin, alpha/beta-galactosidase, Œ≤-glucuronidase, Œ±-fucosidase, Œ±-mannosidase, and trypsin. Important dual virulence factors found in P. destructans and many other pathogenic fungi include urease, proteinase (aspartyll) and superoxide dismutase. Control agents In 2011, several compounds (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where shown to effectively inhibit the growth of P. destructans including benzalkonium chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, pyrithione zinc and sulconazole. The same study showed that P. destructans was sensitive to Amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole, while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia. A 2015 study showed that Rhodococcus rhodochrous could inhibit the growth of P. destructans. A positive breakthrough may have come while utilizing competitive genetics to investigate the evolutionary history of P. destructans compared to six closely related nonpathogenic species. The study published in the journal Nature in 2018 discovered that due to a lost enzyme, P. destructans lacks an ability to repair DNA which has been damaged by ultraviolet (UV) light. Ongoing research is taking place to see if there is a practical method to have bats activate a UV system as they enter and leave a hibernaculum and treat their infection. Not a long term solution, it may be enough to avoid population collapse allowing the species to evolve its own defenses to the fungus as Eurasian bats have.

Meteorological history Tropical Cyclone Tasha was first identified on 24 December 2010 by the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) as a weak area of low pressure accompanied by increasing deep convection. At the surface, the structure of the storm's circulation was uncertain as feeder bands provided a clear indication of its centre; however, the lack of westerly winds at the surface refuted this. Situated roughly east-northeast of Cairns, Queensland, favourable environmental conditions, such as low wind shear, would allow for further development of the low. Later on 24 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low. Shortly thereafter, the system rapidly consolidated as deep convection formed around a well-defined low-level circulation. This prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as they anticipated the system to intensify into a tropical cyclone within the following 24 hours. At 16:00 UTC, the BOM upgraded the low to a Category 1 cyclone, assigning with the name Tasha. Within hours of the BoM declaring Tasha a tropical cyclone, the JTWC followed suit and issued their first advisory on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 04P. Situated along the northwestern edge of a subtropical ridge, Tasha tracked southwestward towards Queensland, Australia and intensified. The storm attained its peak intensity on 24 December with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a barometric pressure of 993 mbar (hPa; 29.32 inHg). Hours later, the centre of Tasha made landfall between Cairns and Innisfail at this intensity. Later that day, the BOM issued their final advisory on Tasha as it weakened to a tropical low over Queensland; the JTWC followed suit shortly thereafter. The remnants of Tasha persisted in the region for several more days, bringing heavy rains to much of Queensland. Impact and aftermath Following the Bureau of Meteorology's first advice for the tropical low on 24 December, a cyclone warning was declared for areas between Port Douglas and Lucinda, Queensland. Some parts of Queensland were already suffering from flooding and additional rainfall was expected to worsen the situation. Although a relatively weak storm, Tasha produced widespread torrential rains in Queensland, amounting to more than in some areas. Thousands of hectares of cropland were inundated by floods and many towns and cities were underwater. In Theodore, much of the area was flooded after the Dawson River reached its highest level in 50 years, cresting around . This surpassed the previous record by more than . Efforts to evacuate the entire town of 300 were made as water levels continued to rise. Thousands of people were evacuated by local authorities using military helicopters. The town of Ingham was isolated as the Herbert River reached a level of . The town of Dalby was split in two by the swollen Myall Creek, leaving more than 100 homes flooded. One fatality took place in Mareeba, near where Tasha made landfall, where a man drowned after being swept off a footbridge.http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/man- found-dead-in-flooded-creek-20101230-19aga.html Areas as far south as Brisbane were affected by Tasha. There, roughly 1,100 emergency calls for help were made as hundreds of drivers became trapped on flooded roads. In New South Wales, 175 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as the flooding spread south. An additional 800 people were isolated in the towns of Urbenville and Bonalbo on 28 December as flood waters blocked off roads. By 28 December, nearly half of Queensland was flooded and preliminary damage estimates exceeded A$1.4 billion. Total economic losses also reached A$6 billion, roughly 0.5% of the nation's gross domestic product. In response to the severe flooding, the Government of Queensland declared numerous towns as disaster areas, allowing for federal funds to be used. By 27 December, flood waters began to recede in Babinda and Gordonvale, leaving behind debris and thick black mud. The following day, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that additional Blackhawk helicopters would be sent to assist in evacuation efforts.

She has released six studio albums and four EPs. Early life Audrey Assad's mother was from Virginia and her father is an Arab-American of Syrian descent. She was raised Protestant, as part of the Plymouth Brethren denomination. Assad started playing the piano at age two, and spent her youth moving around New Jersey before settling in Scotch Plains from ages 7 to 18.Flores, Ra√∫l A. \\"For openers\\", San Antonio Express-News, September 11, 2009. Retrieved July 21, 2011. \\"Audrey Assad Young new artist from Scotch Plains NJ weaves her melodic voice with keyboard acoustics and lyrics that explore faith through music.\\" Music career Her debut album, The House You're Building, was released through Sparrow Records in July 2010 and went on to be named on Amazon.com's list of Best Christian Music of 2010,The following source cites this same Amazon list, but misstates it as an apparent award rather than an entry on a list. See as well as the Christian and Gospel Breakthrough Album of the Year on iTunes.See Atwell, Billy (January 17, 2011), op. cit. She has worked and toured with other CCM artists such as Chris Tomlin, Tenth Avenue North, Matt Maher and Jars of Clay. In 2018, she released Evergreen. =Early career in Florida= In 2002, when Assad was 18, her family moved to Florida and she spent the next six years there. At 19, she briefly attended college and supported herself with odd jobs while beginning her musical career, writing and composing songs for the first time. Assad spent the next five years playing at various venues, performing original songs and covers. Venues ranged from restaurants, weddings, and coffee shops to leading and organizing worship concerts at church. In 2003, Assad recorded a four-song demo with Drew Middleton, a member of the CCM band Tenth Avenue North at the time. Assad toured with the band occasionally during that time. =Nashville and the Firefly EP= In 2008 when Assad was 24, she decided to move to Nashville, Tennessee to continue and focus on her music career. She raised $7,000 from friends and fans to support her move from Florida. In Nashville, she worked with producers Paul Moak and Phillip LaRue and recorded a five-song EP, Firefly, which sold at shows and featured a handwritten cover made of a brown paper bag. She supported herself by working as a nanny before meeting fellow Catholic musician Matt Maher. Maher took Assad under his wing and brought her to various gigs, where she sang back-up vocals and played sets during his shows. The time they spent together around Maher's home base of Phoenix, Arizona, would later prompt Assad to move there from Nashville. During this time, Assad also signed on to work as a staff writer for EMI Christian Music Group Publishing, doing songwriting work with other artists. =Sparrow Records= In 2009, Assad signed with Sparrow Records, who had been talking to Assad after the release of her EP. For her first album, Assad then met and played for producer Marshall Altman, who eventually agreed to produce what would become The House You're Building. Altman and Assad recorded the album at the Galt Line Studio in Los Angeles. The House You're Building was released on July 13, 2010, and the title track was featured as a free download on iTunes Discovery Download. The album performed well commercially and critically, going on to become the Amazon.com's \\"Best Album of 2010\\" in the Christian Music category, as well as being the best selling new artist in the Christian Music category of 2010 according to SoundScan. The album reached No. 12 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and No. 6 on its Heatseekers chart. Her second album, Heart, was released on February 14, 2012. The album sold 7,300 units in its debut week, an increase of 185 percent over her previous album, and reached No. 18 on the overall iTunes chart. For the most part, the new album was a further development of the ‚Ä≥piano-driven style and lyrical depth‚Ä≥ that The House You're Building had shown. The track \\"Sparrow\\", was released as a single, and similarly did well. \\"Sparrow\\" was based on the classic gospel hymn, \\"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\\", which Assad said she loved seeing and hearing in Sister Act 2 when she was young. =Fortunate Fall Records= Wanting to steer her music closer to liturgical and worship music and attracted by the economic advantages of independent production, Audrey Assad parted ways with Sparrow Records \\"on good terms\\". Assad ran a Kickstarter campaign with the help of her husband that reached double its goal by its finish on April 15, 2013. The proceeds paid for Assad's third studio album, Fortunate Fall, which Assad produced herself under the name \\"Fortunate Fall Records\\", as well as a live concert EP, O Happy Fault, and a film of the concert. Assad released her second independent album, Inheritance, on February 12, 2016. Besides two original songs, both co-written with Matt Maher, the rest of the album contains new renditions of traditional church hymns such as \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\" and \\"Be Thou My Vision,\\" as well as a new rendition of the Latin-language hymn \\"Ubi caritas.\\" \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\" saw radio airplay after its release as a single on March 15, 2016. On July 10, 2017, Assad announced via her Twitter page that she was recording her first album of original material since Fortunate Fall, indicating a release in February 2018. The album, Evergreen, became available for pre-order via PledgeMusic, with 5 percent of campaign proceeds going towards Preemptive Love Coalition. Musical style and themes Assad grew up in a religious household but listened to secular music through her mother's influence, including The Carpenters, James Taylor and Celine Dion, as well as to French and Middle Eastern music through her dad's influence. Later, she discovered and began listening to Christian music, such as Newsboys, Nichole Nordeman and Cindy Morgan. She began using her piano talents at 19, when she led worship and began writing and performing her own music. Assad played in local Florida venues with a style she described as folky and \\"average girl with a guitar/piano stuff\\". The Firefly EP that she recorded with Paul Moak was also described as folky and rootsy. Her current style is a mix of religious and non-religious themed songs that draw from her Catholic faith as well as from her love of literature and poetry. A majority of her religious songs are written in a way that emphasizes being sung to God rather than about God. Personal life Assad was raised in a Protestant religious household; she reconfirmed her faith at the age of 19. Assad converted to Catholicism in 2007 in Florida. Assad met her future partner in Arizona while on tour with Matt Maher in 2008; the couple married on February 19, 2011 in Phoenix. In October 2017, Assad gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Camila St. Clare., October 20, 2017. Retrieved October 26, 2017.

Women from eastern Hungary are subjected to forced prostitution in Budapest and areas in Hungary along the Austrian border. Roma women and girls who grow up in Hungarian orphanages are highly vulnerable to internal forced prostitution. Men from Western Europe travel to Budapest for the purpose of adult sex tourism, some of which may involve the exploitation of trafficking victims. Men and women are subjected to conditions of forced labor within Hungary. Women from Romania and Ukraine are transported through Hungary to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France, and the United Arab Emirates where they are subsequently subjected to forced prostitution; some of these victims may be exploited in Hungary before they reach their final destination country. The Government of Hungary does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated law enforcement progress in 2009, including amending Paragraph 175/b of its criminal code to increase penalties for cases involving child victims of human trafficking under the age of 12 as well as an increase in the number of traffickers convicted and sentenced to time in prison, though it did not prosecute or convict any labor trafficking offenders. The government demonstrated mixed progress in improving victim assistance during the reporting period; while it allocated funding for a new NGO-run shelter that opened in March 2010 and guaranteed funding through June 2011, the shelter did not assist any victims during the reporting period. Moreover, the shelter is permitted only to assist Hungarian victims, excluding the assistance of any potential foreign victims. The lack of victim assistance funding by the government in 2008 and most of 2009 may have resulted in a decrease in victims assisted in 2009.\\"Hungary\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Hungary‚Äôs anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts improved during the reporting period. Hungary prohibits all forms of trafficking through Paragraph 175/b of its criminal code, though prosecutors rely on other trafficking-related statutes to prosecute most trafficking cases. During the reporting period, the government amended Paragraph 175/b to increase penalties for cases involving child victims under the age of 12. Penalties prescribed in Paragraph 175/b now range from one year up to life imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Authorities note that because of a ruling by the Supreme Court of Hungary, prosecutors must meet strict evidentiary requirements for proving the crime of human trafficking under Paragraph 175/b, specifically that the prosecutor must prove that a victim of human trafficking is either bought or sold by another person; because of this standard, prosecutors generally use other statues to prosecute trafficking offenders. Police and border guards conducted 27 trafficking investigations, compared with 21 investigations in 2008. Authorities prosecuted 16 traffickers in 2009, compared with 18 in 2008. Convictions were obtained against 23 sex trafficking offenders in 2009, compared with 16 sex trafficking and two labor trafficking convictions in 2008. During the last year, the government did not report any prosecutions or convictions for labor trafficking offenses. In 2009, twenty of 23 convicted offenders were sentenced to time in prison, an improvement from 2008 when 11 out of 18 convicted offenders were sentenced to time in prison. Of those sentenced to prison in 2009, 12 convicted offenders received sentences of up to three years‚Äô imprisonment, three offenders received sentences ranging from three to four years‚Äô imprisonment, and five offenders received sentences of five years‚Äô imprisonment. During the reporting period, 55 law enforcement officials received victim sensitivity training and victim identification training. The government also conducted three joint trafficking investigations with law enforcement authorities from the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria. Protection The Hungarian government undertook modest steps to provide victim assistance during the reporting period; however, more should be done to ensure more victims have access to assistance. A total of 94 victims were identified by NGOs and government officials in 2009, compared with 88 reportedly identified in 2008. The government allocated approximately $61,000 to an NGO to establish a trafficking shelter that will operate through June 2010. Although this is an improvement from 2008, when the government did not provide funding for NGOs providing victim assistance including shelter, medical care, legal assistance, and psychological counseling, the government- funded shelter will only provide assistance to Hungarian victims; no victims were provided assistance in this shelter during the reporting period. Additionally, only 45 trafficking victims were provided assistance, including shelter, by one privately funded NGO during the reporting period, compared with 88 victims assisted in 2008. The lack of victim assistance funding by the government in 2008 and most of 2009 and the subsequent closure of one shelter in mid-2008 that had been provided free facility space by the government may have resulted in a decrease in the number of victims assisted in 2009. The government may have assisted some victims of trafficking through general crime victim programs in 2009, though the government was unable to provide the specific number of victims assisted by these programs. The government-run trafficking hotline referred nine victims to NGOs for assistance last year, a decrease from 50 victims referred by the hotline in 2008. Law enforcement and consular officials identified approximately 30 victims domestically and abroad in 2009, compared with 26 in 2008. Both law enforcement and NGOs were often unaware or uncertain about what services victims of trafficking were eligible to receive; this lack of awareness may have limited the number of victims assisted during the reporting period. Victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, and there were no reported cases of authorities‚Äô mistreatment of trafficking victims. The government encouraged victims to assist with trafficking investigations and prosecutions; in 2009, twenty-seven victims assisted in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. The government offered foreign victims a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to assist law enforcement; however, no foreign victims applied for or received the 30-day temporary residency permits in 2009. NGOs expressed concern that Hungarian victims were not provided with a reflection period to receive assistance and decide whether or not to assist law enforcement; instead, Hungarian victims were required to decide upon identification whether or not they wanted to assist law enforcement. Foreign victims may apply for a six-month temporary residency permit if they choose to cooperate with law enforcement. Prevention The Hungarian government demonstrated modest efforts to raise awareness during the reporting period. The government again did not conduct any general anti- trafficking awareness campaigns focused on the general public or potential victims of trafficking; however, it did allocate $15,800 for a campaign targeted at potential consumers of prostitution in order to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. As reported in the 2009 Report, the three-month campaign started in March 2009 and consisted of radio advertisements, posters placed in 100 gas stations throughout Hungary, and information posted on the Ministry of Justice‚Äôs website that reportedly received 4,000 download requests. The Hungarian government actively monitored immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking.

On February 1, Kessler earned her first NCAA assist. In a match against Brown, Kessler assisted on a goal logged by Kathryn Farni. A February 23 victory over Cornell (by a 4-2 tally) gave Kessler her 25th victory of the season. Her junior season (2008‚Äì09) resulted in her being named to the ECAC Hockey preseason all-league team. Statistically, she ranked first in the ECAC with a 1.55 goals-against average in conference play. In the Beanpot semifinal (from February 3, 2009), she stopped 17 shots against Boston University as the Crimson prevailed. A February 20 win over the St. Lawrence Skating Saints resulted in Kessler's fourth shutout of the season. During the ECAC Quarterfinals (on February 27 and 28), Kessler logged back-to-back shutouts against Cornell (by tallies of 3-0, 4-0), respectively. As a senior (2009‚Äì10), Kessler was fifth in the NCAA with a .944 save percentage. She would also rank fifth with a 1.39 goals-against average. In the Crimson's season opening match versus Colgate (contested on October 30, 2009), Kessler registered 29 saves. On November 14, she would set a career high by blocking 37 shots versus Princeton. On December 4 and 5, 2010, Kessler had one of the best performances of her NCAA career. She recorded 24 saves against Minnesota on Dec. 4, as the Crimson prevailed by a 1-0 mark. She followed up her performance with 29 saves to guide Harvard to a 0-0 tie the following day. Entering the weekend, Minnesota had not been shut out since the 2006-07 season.Harvard A December 8 victory versus the Connecticut Huskies (in which the Crimson earned a 2-1 win) resulted in Kessler tying Ali Boe for the Harvard career win record of 63. Win number 64 came on January 16, 2010 in a 21 save effort that resulted in a 5-1 victory over the Colgate Raiders. Her career save percentage of .9414 (1,863 of 1,979 shots) is the all-time best in NCAA history. =Hockey Canada= She was in attendance for the first ever IIHF development camp (held in Vierumaki, Finland). Kessler represented the OWHA and Hockey Canada. In 2006, she was selected to Canada's under-22 national team but did not compete due to injury. Kessler was part of the Canadian Under 22 squad that participated in a three- game series versus the US Under 22 team in August 2009. Kessler accumulated 40 saves in two games for Canada's Under-22 Team. In January 2009, she was part of the silver medal winning team at the MLP Cup in January 2009.

Some victims transit through Gabon en route to exploitation in Equatorial Guinea. According to UNICEF, the majority of victims are boys who are forced to work as street hawkers or mechanics. Girls generally are subjected to conditions of involuntary domestic servitude, or forced labor in markets or roadside restaurants. Stepped-up coastal surveillance over the past year ‚Äì especially following the October 2009 arrival in Gabonese waters of a sea vessel that was carrying 34 child trafficking victims, some of whom were destined for Equatorial Guinea ‚Äì caused traffickers to change their routes, which included utilizing estuaries and rivers to transport children. The majority of victims were young girls, a departure from previous patterns of trafficking in the region. Trafficking offenders appear to operate in loose ethnic-based crime networks. Most child traffickers are women, who serve as intermediaries in their countries of origin. In some cases, child victims report that their parents had turned them over to intermediaries promising employment opportunities in Gabon. The government has no reports of international organized crime syndicates, employment agencies, marriage brokers, or travel services facilitating trafficking in Gabon. In 2009, the government began tracking a new trend of young adults between ages 18 and 25 being forced into domestic servitude or prostitution in Gabon.\\"Gabon\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Gabon does not fully comply with what the U.S. government considers to be minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts ‚Äì most notably the arrests of seven suspected traffickers and the expansion of protection services for child victims of trafficking ‚Äì the government did not show evidence of increasing efforts to address trafficking. Specifically, the government, for another consecutive year, did not provide information on prosecutions or convictions of traffickers, despite the arrest of over 30 suspected offenders between 2003 and 2008. Because of this, Gabon has been placed on the Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Gabon has demonstrated limited progress in anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts. Gabon has several laws regarding forms of human trafficking. Law 09/04, enacted in September 2004, is used to protect children against sex or labor trafficking in Gabon. The law prescribes penalties of 5 to 15 years of imprisonment, along with fines of $20,000 to $40,000. The procurement of a child for the purpose of prostitution is prohibited under Penal Code Article 261, which prescribes 2 to 5 years of imprisonment and a fine. Forced prostitution of adults is prohibited by law 21/63-94, which prescribes 2 to 10 years of imprisonment. During 2010, the government reported seven arrests for trafficking, but did not provide details of the cases. The government also did not report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions during the year. In February 2010, three suspected traffickers were arrested on the border trying to bring 18 young adults from Cameroon, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea into Gabon. The suspects remain jailed as the investigation continues. As the Criminal Court maintained its calendar providing for only one meeting per year, and for one week, suspected trafficking offenders typically waited in jail for trials, and received credit for time served. Protection The Government of Gabon showed progress in its efforts to ensure that victims of trafficking received access to necessary protective services. Government personnel employed procedures to identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable groups, such as migrant children, and referred them systematically to government or NGO shelters. In responding a vessel in Gabon waters, authorities identified the 34 children aboard the vessel (among 285 others) as trafficking victims and took steps to provide them with assistance. The government coordinated the repatriation of the vessel‚Äôs victims to their countries of origin with the concerned governments. In direct support of victim protection measures, the government spent approximately $270,000 to support three centers offering foster care to child victims of trafficking in Libreville and Port-Gentil. One of the centers is completely government-funded, while the other two are financed partly by the government through material donations and social worker access, and partly through others. These centers provided shelter, medical care, education, and rehabilitation services, as well as psychosocial services to educate victims on asserting their rights. The government provided temporary de facto resident status for trafficking victims, and refrained from deporting them. The government also began rehabilitation of two more centers, and opened more child protection centers in Franceville, Moanda and Tchibanga. The government also opened six centers for street children and the Ministry of Interior operated two transit centers for illegal immigrants ‚Äì an alternative to jail. Prevention The Gabonese government made some efforts to prevent human trafficking during 2010. In 2009, as the first step in its effort to improve targeting of its prevention messages, it surveyed 2,500 residents to examine the public‚Äôs understanding of violence against children, including trafficking. In accordance with the survey findings, an outreach campaign aimed at identifying child victims of violence will begin. In his effort to increase awareness, the country‚Äôs President raised the topic of trafficking in Council of Ministers meetings. Also in 2009, the government monitored migration patterns for evidence of trafficking to Gabon. The government stepped up its efforts to enhance maritime security through aerial surveillance. An inter-Ministerial Committee to Combat Child Trafficking was created by Law 09/04. The inter-ministerial committee published and distributed leaflets and posters entitled ‚ÄúSTOP child exploitation‚Äù to highlight forms and consequences of trafficking and its hotline number. Heavy government press coverage of anti-trafficking training sponsored by a foreign government helped raise awareness of victim identification and law enforcement responses. The government did not take action during 2010 to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. However, the commercial sex trade is not a widespread problem in Gabon. Gabon is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

He is often portrayed as a villain due to his association with death and the underworld.  Film and Television  Hades appears in the movies Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief played by Steve Coogan, and the remake of Clash of the Titans and its sequel Wrath of the Titans, where he is played by Ralph Fiennes. In the three television series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena: Warrior Princess and Young Hercules Hades was a recurring character, most frequently played by Erik Thomson, although Mark Ferguson and Stephen Lovatt have also played the part. He was depicted as being overworked and understaffed.

In the Disney 1997 film Hercules, Hades appears as the main antagonist. Unlike the mythological Hades, this version is a fast-talking, hot tempered, evil deity; a combination of Satan and a dodgy Hollywood agent.

The Gambia is a source, transit, and destination country for this type of exploitation. Within the Gambia, women and girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation, as well as for domestic servitude. For generations, parents sent their sons to live with Koranic teachers or marabouts, who more often forced children to beg than ensured their progress in religious studies. However, this practice is declining as the security forces now routinely interrogate the marabout of any beggar they find in the streets. Some observers noted only a small number of trafficking victims, but others see the Gambia's porous borders as an active transit zone for women, girls, and boys from West African countries ‚Äì mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, and Benin ‚Äì who are recruited for exploitation in the sex trade, in particular to meet the demands of European tourists seeking sex with children. Most trafficking offenders in the Gambia are probably individuals who operate independently of international syndicates. The government's Department of Social Welfare and Tourism Security Unit are compiling electronic databases and conventional lists of trafficking cases, offenders, and victims, which may soon provide a clearer picture of how traffickers operate and how they differ from the migrant smugglers whose cases are now filling the country's courts. The Government of the Gambia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. At the highest level, the government acknowledges that trafficking exists in the country. The Gambian government lacks funding and resources to fight trafficking, though it continued to monitor and evaluate the trafficking problem in the country. Every law enforcement agency has anti-trafficking or child protection units. In July 2009, the government took an important step to increase efficiency in law enforcement by adopting a biometric national identity card system called GAMBIS.\\"The Gambia\\".

U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of the Gambia demonstrated limited progress in its anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts, resulting in one conviction of a trafficking offender during the reporting period. The Gambia prohibits all forms of trafficking through its October 2007 Trafficking in Persons Act. The law does not differentiate between sexual exploitation and labor exploitation, and prescribes penalties of from 15 years' to life imprisonment, penalties which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Gambia's 2005 Children's Act also prohibits all forms of child trafficking, prescribing a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In July 2009, a Banjul court convicted a Gambian man of trafficking two children and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. In June 2009, authorities investigated reports that a group of girls from Ghana had been trafficked to a fishing settlement called \\"Ghana Town\\" for exploitation in prostitution. An interagency team of investigators visited the site and found the reports to be inaccurate. The government did not provide specialized anti-trafficking training for law enforcement and immigration officials during the reporting period. Protection The government improved its victim protection efforts during the reporting period. It did not undertake proactive efforts to identify foreign trafficking victims. The government continued to operate a 24-hour shelter, made up of three units with accommodations for 48 victims. The shelter did not receive any trafficked children during 2009. The government maintained and funded a 24-hour hotline number that directly connected callers with two dedicated officers of the Department of Social Welfare. The line was created as a family assistance tool, but was also advertised as an available resource for victims of trafficking. The government maintained a drop-in center for street children, including victims of trafficking, and it provided both the shelter and the drop-in center with an annual budget of about $11,500, in addition to contributions from UNICEF and a faith-based NGO. The government also provided food, medical care, and counseling to all trafficking victims, whether nationals or foreigners. Victims could obtain emergency temporary residence visas under the Trafficking in Persons Act, though none did so during the year. The government did not identify or assist with the repatriation of any Gambian victims of transnational trafficking during the year. Under the law, however, repatriated nationals were eligible for government-provided care and rehabilitation measures. Gambian authorities identified at least three people that were trafficking victims during the reporting period ‚Äì two young girls, whose trafficker was prosecuted and imprisoned in July 2009, and a Nigerian girl who reported her trafficking plight to the Child Protection Alliance and the Police Child Welfare Officer in October. The two children were returned to their parents, but the Nigerian girl disappeared. There was no formal system for proactively identifying victims of trafficking, but law enforcement and border control officers who were alert to trafficking situations more intensively questioned adults who arrived at the border with children. There were not enough active trafficking cases to make an assessment about respect for victims' rights, but if trafficking was suspected or identified, Social Welfare would likely have interceded and no victim would have been prosecuted or fined. Training conducted throughout the year attempted to give security officers the ability to identify and assist potential trafficking victims. There was only one reported case of a victim assisting the authorities in investigation. The government undertook efforts to train and further educate officials in recognizing human trafficking situations and victims. During the year, the government designated officers within each major police station to be responsible for assisting and counseling any potential trafficking victims. However, the government provided no information on such training for Gambian embassies and consulates in foreign countries. Prevention The Government of the Gambia sustained moderate efforts to prevent trafficking through awareness-raising during the reporting period. The government previously supported anti-trafficking and information campaigns, most conducted by NGOs, but reported few such campaigns in 2009. Government-controlled media continued to publicize the dangers of trafficking. There was no comprehensive analysis of emigration and immigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. In December 2009, the government dissolved its multiagency National Task Force for Combating Trafficking in Persons and allocated approximately $111,000 to finance the establishment of the new National Agency to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which was designated to implement the national anti-trafficking plan of action. The government's Tourism Security Unit (TSU) effectively patrolled the Tourism Development Area ‚Äì the zone most frequented by tourists ‚Äì to combat child sex tourism and reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The TSU continued to enforce a 2005 ban on unattended children visiting the tourist resort areas and remitted them to the custody of the Department of Social Welfare. Police sometimes arrested persons suspected of engaging in prostitution. However, these measures were not strong deterrents, and reflected the common perception that prostitution was meeting the needs of tourists who drove a major part of the country's economy. In March 2009, the government convicted a New Zealand national of child pornography and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment; he was acquitted of child defilement charges. Child sex tourism was a problem in the Gambia, but the authorities did not report any prosecution or convictions of child sex tourists during the reporting period. The Gambian government provided its troops with antihuman trafficking training, including warnings against committing any immoral behavior that may bring their force into disrepute, prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.

In 2009, women and girls from Georgia were forced into prostitution in Georgia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Greece. In recent years, cases of forced prostitution of Georgian victims were also documented in Russia, Germany, and Austria. Men and women have been forced into labor in Georgia, Libya and Turkey. Men from Turkey are also forced into labor in the breakaway region of Abkhazia, which is outside the Georgian government‚Äôs control. The government of Georgia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government demonstrated strong efforts to identify and assist victims of trafficking and again increased its victim assistance funding to $312,000. The government also demonstrated impressive law enforcement success, significantly increasing the number of individuals convicted of trafficking, and again ensuring all convicted trafficking offenders served some time in prison. The Georgian government also demonstrated strong prevention efforts and continued its close partnership with anti-trafficking NGOs in both victim assistance and prevention efforts.\\"Georgia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017.  Youth trafficking and sex work  A schematic showing global human trafficking, with specific focus to women and children. Georgia is labelled on the map as being the trafficking origin for a 'high number of people'. Street children in Georgia, are particularly susceptible to exploitation through means of trafficking. Whether it be through begging or theft by third parties, including their parents, this subcategory of the population is considered to be at risk. Children working in agriculture and in the informal urban economy are especially vulnerable to forced labor. Trafficking of children is a large concern within this area. Thousands of children living in the streets and in orphanages are trafficked annually. Some families experiencing economic hardship have been forced to separate, which has directly increased the number of children living on the streets in Georgia. This is a direct result of familial stress on the children, which often leads to youth feeling responsible to take on means of supporting the family in hard times, by then bringing in money through illegal means. As a large portion of children, who are susceptible to be drawn into the realm of trafficking, are first noted as high-risk youth and street children, it is relevant to note that statistic that UNICEF estimated that 28.8 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years in Georgia were working in 1999. While the majority of working children work in family businesses, and in agriculture in rural areas, there are reports of significant numbers of children, some as young as 5 years old, engaged in begging or working on the streets. Children as young as 9 years old are found working in markets, sometimes at night, and involved in carrying or loading wares. Children also work in cafes, bistros, gas stations, and for street photographers. The relevance of these statistics annotate the sense that a majority of these working children are out in the community, as opposed to working within the safer confines of their homes. Having to go outside the home to work within the community at a young age plays a role in the risk of being a youth in this area. According to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, police violence against street children is a problem. In general, there is a lack of social safety services for children living on the street, with disabilities or from dysfunctional households. Children, especially young girls are commonly trafficked for the purposes of Commercial sexual exploitation of children, particularly for prostitution and pornography. In 2003, the statistical bureau of the Supreme Court reported 24 registered cases of the use of children in the drug trade and trafficking. This burden can then lead to negative impacts the female as they mature on both their sexual health, as well as concerns about their mental stability. The government of Georgia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking where children are involved. During the year, however, local experts expressed serious concerns about the government‚Äôs view of its trafficking problem and its lack of effective efforts in the first half of the reporting period to proactively identify victims of this serious crime. In the duration of the reporting period, the government increased the number of trafficking cases investigated and the percentage of prosecutions that resulted in convictions of trafficking offenders. The government also significantly increased funding for anti-trafficking training and trafficking prevention activities, including in the budgets of its shelters for victims. The government significantly increased the number of Georgian officials provided training on victim identification. Prosecution The Government of Georgia demonstrated increased law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Georgia prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 143 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from seven to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2009, the government investigated 33 trafficking cases, compared with 14 investigations in 2008. Authorities prosecuted 40 individuals for trafficking ‚Äì including three individuals for forced labor ‚Äì compared with 10 individuals prosecuted for sex trafficking in 2008. Thirty-seven trafficking offenders were convicted in 2009, a significant increase from 10 convicted offenders in 2008. All 37 convicted trafficking offenders were sentenced to time in prison; none received a suspended sentence. The average sentence was 21 years‚Äô imprisonment. There were no reports of trafficking-related complicity of law enforcement personnel from either NGOs or the government. In 2009, the government relied on partnerships with local NGOs and international organizations to provide trafficking training to approximately 170 prosecutors and judges. The training concentrated on mechanisms for proactive victim identification, special methods for investigation and the collection of evidence, and prosecution techniques, and highlighted the importance of partnerships with NGOs, social workers, and psychologists during victim interviews. Protection The Georgian government maintained its significant victim assistance efforts over the reporting period. The government allocated a total of $312,000 for victim assistance during the reporting period; of that, it provided $150,000 to fully fund two government-run trafficking shelters, the same amount as funded in 2008. These shelters provided comprehensive victim assistance, including medical aid, psychological counseling, and legal assistance. Victim assistance was not conditional upon cooperating with law enforcement. The government continued to implement a formal mechanism for its officials to identify and refer victims for assistance. The government identified 48 victims in 2009 and referred 15 victims for assistance, an increase from 21 trafficking victims identified in 2008. The government provided shelter and comprehensive assistance to 15 victims, compared with 10 victims in 2008. The government also made available one-time compensation payments of $650 to trafficking victims in 2009. However, no victims applied for the funds during the reporting period. Five victims were given $600 each in 2008. Georgian authorities provided foreign victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they would face hardship or retribution; the Law on Legal Status of Foreigners provided a foreign person suspected of being a victim of trafficking the right to a residence permit even if authorities could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person was a victim. In 2009, no foreign victims requested a residence permit. The government cooperated with IOM and fully funded the repatriation of one foreign victim during the reporting period. Victims were encouraged to assist law enforcement with trafficking investigations and prosecutions; 18 victims assisted law enforcement during the reporting period. There were no reports that victims were penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The Government of Georgia sustained its efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. The government produced and broadcast during the first six months of 2009 a short television public service announcement explaining the nature and danger of human trafficking. The Ministry of Education and Science produced a short television announcement targeting school-age children entitled ‚ÄúDo Not Trade Freedom for Slavery,‚Äù which was regularly aired on television. The Government of Georgia improved its anti-trafficking prevention activities in 2011 and significantly increased cooperation with NGOs to conduct prevention campaigns. The government began enacting legislation in December 2011. They did this by authorizing the executive branch for the first time to make grants to NGOs. Pursuant to this legislation, the government provided small grants to two NGOs in early 2012 to work on projects related to public awareness of trafficking and information pertaining to victim identification. It also entered into memoranda of understanding with leading NGOs to expand and coordinate cooperation in addressing trafficking. During the year the government conducted multiple information campaigns utilizing a broad array of media, including public service announcements, seminars, and television broadcasts throughout the country. The Civil Registry Agency continued its practice of distributing over 20,000 anti-trafficking related pamphlets when it issued new passports to citizens. The government also conducted numerous outreach events including some focused on specific high risk segments of the population, such as university and high schools students, internally displaced persons, and ethnic minorities living in the regions, would were more likely to be recognized as high-risk groups. Events included numerous panel discussions, a film screening, a peer education campaign, and an essay contest, all which provided research as well as preventative ideas regarding human trafficking in the country. The government distributed 10,000 donor- funded trafficking indicator cards to front-line responders, including law enforcement and border officials. In coordination with NGOs, the government posted anti-trafficking posters on cross-border buses and distributed multilingual leaflets to cross-border truck drivers and others. In November 2011, authorities created a high-level, steering committee to oversee the implementation of an EU-funded project to address street children. In March 2011, the government approved its new anti-trafficking National Action Plan for 2011-2012, produced with extensive collaboration with the NGO community. Because their focus was on human and child trafficking specifically, during the reporting period, the government did not initiate any campaigns to reduce demand for commercial sex acts.

The synod was formed on September 14, 1818, and adopted the name Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States by about 1850. It used that name or slight variants until it merged with the Iowa Synod and the Buffalo Synod in 1930 to form the first American Lutheran Church (ALC), 1930-1960. In 1929, just before its merger into the ALC, the Ohio Joint Synod had 768 pastors, 876 congregations, and 166,521 members. History =Origin and names= During the 1780s and 1790s, German-speaking Lutherans began to move west from the original 13 states on the Atlantic coast into the portion of the old Northwest Territory formed 1787, that is now the future state of Ohio (and included territories north of the Ohio River, future states of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota), with the numbers increasing after Ohio gained statehood in 1803. The Pennsylvania Ministerium sent two itinerant Lutheran pastors, Wilhelm Georg Forster and Johannes Stauch, to minister to the immigrants. By 1818 the Ministerim has sent another ten pastors, including Paul Henkel and John Michael Steck. These pastors began meeting together as the Ohio Conference of the Pennsylvania Ministerium, with the first convention on October 17‚Äì19, 1812, in Washington County, Pennsylvania. and the last on September 20‚Äì24, 1817, in New Philadelphia, Ohio. However, the Ohio Conference was not an independent synod, and so any candidates for the pastoral office were required to go to Pennsylvania for ordination. Most candidates found it difficult to make that trip across the Appalachian Mountains, so instead the Ohio Conference merely licensed them to preach. In order to remedy this, the conference asked for and received permission from the Pennsylvania Ministerium to form a new synod, and on September 14, 1818, in Somerset, Ohio, the General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Preachers in Ohio and the Adjacent States () was organized. The synod was known under several other names during its history, including the German Evangelical Lutheran Ministerium in Ohio and the Neighboring States () from 1818 to 1849, and the Synod and Ministerium of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the State of Ohio from 1830 to 1843. It finally adopted the name Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States by about 1850, and used that name or slight variants thereafter. The term \\"Joint Synod\\" reflected the division of the synod into Eastern and Western districts or \\"district synods\\" in 1831, and the organization of a non-geographical English District in 1836 to assist the increasing numbers of English-speaking ministers, congregations and members. =Theological development= The theology of the Ohio Synod was initially shaped by that of the Pennsylvania Ministerium and the Tennessee Synod, and by unionism and the New Measures of the Second Great Awakening. In 1820 the synod discussed joining the Lutheran General Synod being organized, but, for \\"practical reasons\\" rather than theological ones, decided not to. The establishment of relations with Johann Konrad Wilhelm L√∂he and the immigration of additional Lutheran pastors from the German Confederation (Germany) in the early 1840s resulted in an increasing conservative right-ward movement with the synod taking a stronger stance in support of the Lutheran doctrinal confessions contained in the Book of Concord of 1580. =General Council= In 1866, the Pennsylvania Ministerium proposed a union of Lutheran synods to a number of conservative synods unhappy with the theological direction being taken in the earlier General Synod of 1820, including the Ohio Synod. Ten of those synods adopted a proposed constitution and in a convention on November 20, 1867, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, established the General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America. The Ohio Synod sent representatives to the convention, but declined membership until differences on certain points of doctrine could be addressed. Those so-called Four Points, all of which the Ohio Synod opposed, concerned the teaching of millennialism, allowing non-Lutherans to commune at Lutheran altars, allowing non-Lutheran ministers to preach in Lutheran pulpits, and permitting Lutherans to hold membership in Masonic and other secret societies. Failure to reach agreement with the General Council on these points led the Ohio Joint Synod to look elsewhere for affiliations and allies. =Synodical Conference= In October 1870, the Joint Synod of Ohio contacted several of the conservative Midwestern Lutheran synods that were opposed to the larger now nationwide General Synod of 1820, or had either never joined the General Council of 1866 or had withdrawn from it, to discuss the possibility of a union. This led, on July 10‚Äì16, 1872, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to the Joint Synod of Ohio, the Missouri Synod, the Wisconsin Synod, the Minnesota Synod, the Illinois Synod, and the Norwegian Synod forming the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America. However, in 1881, less than a decade later, the \\"Predestination Controversy\\" led to the Ohio Synod leaving the Synodical Conference. In that controversy the Ohio and Norwegian synods held that God elects people to salvation \\"in view of the faith\\" () he foresaw they would have, while the Missouri and Wisconsin synods held that the cause is wholly due to God's grace. Efforts made between 1903 and 1929 to reach agreement on the issue were ultimately unsuccessful. During this time, Frederick William Stellhorn left the Missouri Synod to become a seminary professor in the Ohio Synod. Administrative offices for the synod by the 1910s with a President and a few secretaries and staff were established in Columbus, Ohio near its publishing house and Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary (1830) and affiliated Capital University (1850). =Mergers= During the discussions with the Missouri and Wisconsin synods, The Ohio Joint Synod continued to work with the smaller Iowa and Buffalo synods. In 1930 those three synods (also largely made up of German-American Lutherans in the Mid-West) merged to form the American Lutheran Church (1930-1960), centered in Columbus, Ohio and continuing its affiliations with the previous Joint Synod seminary and university there along with several other educational institutions from the former Iowa and Buffalo synods. After a short but influential three decades of existence, the first ALC (German based but increasingly Americanized), led the movement for a first multi- ethnic union in 1960 with the Evangelical Lutheran Church (mainly Norwegian- American Lutherans) and the United Evangelical Lutheran Church (mainly Danish- American Lutherans) to form a new body named similarly as The American Lutheran Church (The ALC), with headquarters now in the former Scandinavian strongholds of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in which an additional body, the Lutheran Free Church joined in 1963. That second ALC body in turn after only 28 years of existence merged with the eastern based Lutheran Church in America (which itself was a subsequent union from 1962 of four smaller various ethic- based synods) and with offices in New York City and Philadelphia joined with the decade old Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (from a theological split (\\"Lutheran Civil War\\") in the old Missouri Synod in 1974-1976), in 1988 to form the current larger Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with about two-thirds of American Lutherans today with offices in Chicago. Seminaries and colleges In 1830, the synod instituted its Theological Seminary in Canton, Ohio, with two students in attendance. A year later the seminary was relocated to Columbus, Ohio. Growth in the range of subjects offered led to the division of the institution into two parts. The non-theological secular programs became Capital University (founded in 1850) at Columbus' Bexley suburb, and the seminary was renamed as the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary. The Theological Seminary continued to serve as a seminary of the Joint Synod of Ohio's successor church bodies, the first and second instances of the American Lutheran Church (1930-1960 and 1960-1988). In 1974, it merged with the Hamma Divinity School, which was the theological department of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio and associated with the Lutheran Church in America, to form today's Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Columbus. A \\"practical\\" seminary requiring less academic study was begun as a department of the Theological Seminary in 1881. It moved to a separate campus in Afton, Minnesota, in 1884 and named Luther Seminary. In 1892, it moved again to the Phalen Park area of Saint Paul, Minnesota, and became part of the St. Paul Luther College, Seminary, and Academy. That seminary merged into the Iowa Synod's Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1932, shortly after the merger of the two German-based synods into the first American Lutheran Church two years earlier. The college division of St. Paul Luther College, Seminary, and Academy continued operating in Afton, Minnesota, from 1884 to 1893, and in Saint Paul from 1893 to 1935, at which time it merged into Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa. The Ohio Synod also operated several educational institutions that were relatively short-lived: Hebron Academy opened in Hebron, Nebraska, in 1911, added a junior college in 1924 as Hebron College and Academy, and closed in 1942. Similarly, St. John's Academy opened in Petersburg, West Virginia, in 1921, added a junior college in 1931 to become St. John's Academy and College, and closed in 1933 in the deepening Great Depression. Other schools included Woodville Normal School in Woodville, Ohio, from 1882 to 1923; a second practical seminary in Hickory, North Carolina, from 1887 to 1912; and Pacific Seminary in Olympia, Washington from 1907 until 1911, when the theological department was discontinued, and 1917, when the remaining college department was discontinued.

The nonconsensual exploitation of Ghanaian citizens, particularly children, is more common than the trafficking of foreign migrants. The movement of internally trafficked children is either from rural to urban areas, or from one rural area to another, as from farming to fishing communities. Ghanaian boys and girls are subjected to conditions of forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic servitude, street hawking, begging, portering, and agriculture. Ghanaian girls, and to a lesser extent boys, are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation within Ghana. Internal labor traffickers are commonly freelance operators, and may be known to members of the source community. Uninformed parents may not understand that by cooperating with trafficking offenders, they may expose their children to bonded placement, coercion, or outright sale. Media reports during the year cited 50 Ghanaian women recruited for work in Russia and subsequently forced into prostitution. Women and girls from China, Nigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso are subjected to forced prostitution after arriving in Ghana. Citizens from other West African countries are subjected to forced labor in Ghana in agriculture or involuntary domestic servitude. Trafficking victims endure extremes of harsh treatment, including long hours, debt bondage, lack of pay, physical risks, and sexual abuse.  Government response  The Government of Ghana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. However, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Ghana increased its law enforcement efforts by prosecuting and convicting an increased number of traffickers, including the first convictions relating to forced child labor in the Lake Volta fishing industry. The Ghanaian Police partnered with Interpol to host regional training for law enforcement officials from Anglophone Africa, and the government took steps to establish four regional anti-trafficking units to manage cases more effectively at the regional level. In August 2009, the president appointed new members to the Human Trafficking Management Board, which had been disbanded when the previous government left office in January 2009. However, the government did not demonstrate increased efforts to ensure that victims receive adequate protection, such as funding a shelter for trafficking victims, or increasing assistance to NGOs or international organizations to provide trafficking victim care.\\"Ghana\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed Ghana in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. =Prosecution= The Government of Ghana demonstrated improved anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2010. Ghana prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2005 Human Trafficking Act (HTA), which prescribes a minimum penalty of five years' imprisonment for all forms of trafficking. This penalty is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. In July 2009, the Ghanaian parliament passed a law amending the definition of trafficking to give the HTA uniformity with the language of the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. The Ghana Police Service (GPS) maintains an Anti-human trafficking Unit (AHTU) in its Criminal Investigation Division, which opened 31 trafficking investigations in 2009. The government initiated 15 trafficking prosecutions during the year, an increase over five prosecutions in 2008, and convicted six traffickers in 2009, an increase over the one conviction obtained in 2008. The AHTU claimed credit for repatriating 20 child victims of trafficking to neighboring countries. According to the AHTU, 61 percent of all trafficking cases reported in Ghana were labor-related, while 39 percent were sexual exploitation cases. In June 2009, the government convicted three Chinese nationals of trafficking eight Chinese women to Ghana for exploitation in prostitution. The Accra Circuit Court sentenced the primary trafficking offender to 17 years' imprisonment, including 10 years for human trafficking and two years for conspiracy. His brother received a 12-year sentence ‚Äì 10 years for abetment and two years for conspiracy. In a second case, an offender received a jail sentence of eight years' imprisonment for trafficking three Ghanaian children to C√¥te d'Ivoire. These sentences were well above the mandatory five year minimum. In January 2010, the Agona Swedru Circuit Court convicted a Ghanaian woman for enslaving two boys, ages six and eight, from the Central Region to fish on Lake Volta. The woman was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment ‚Äì the first ever prosecution of a domestic trafficking offender in Ghana. The government joined with neighboring countries, as well as international organizations and foreign embassies, to prosecute transnational cases, most recently in a successful bid to break up a trafficking and prostitution ring that sent at least 50 Ghanaian women to Russia for the sex trade. =Protection= The government demonstrated overall improved victim protection efforts during the year. The government did not employ formal procedures for the identification of victims among vulnerable groups, such as women in prostitution or children at work sites, though it did show increased efforts at ad hoc identification of such victims. The government continued to operate dedicated trafficking shelters for victims of forced labor ‚Äì in Osu and Medina in the greater Accra region, and in the Atebubu Amant District Assembly in the Brong Ahafo region ‚Äì but lacked shelter facilities for victims of sex trafficking. The government provided an unknown amount of funding for these shelters. Ghanaian authorities referred most identified victims to shelters operated by NGOs. According to the AHTU, victims received protective support during and after trials, and prosecutors took their statements behind closed doors to ensure their safety and conceal their identity. With the Interior Minister's approval, a trafficking victim may remain permanently in Ghana if deemed to be in the victim's best interest, though no victims were given such residency during the last year. There was no formal referral process to transfer victims in protective custody to other facilities. The government provided some training to law enforcement officials on identification of trafficking victims. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, though many victims were children afraid to provide testimony. The government provided assistance to its nationals who may have been trafficked, with an eye to rehabilitation and reintegration into the life of the country. Some victims were given capital to start businesses, and others were supported to continue schooling or learn a trade. The government sustained partnerships with local and international NGOs to rescue and rehabilitate forced child laborers in fishing or mining during the reporting period. =Prevention= The Government of Ghana demonstrated renewed efforts to prevent trafficking over the last year. It conducted anti-trafficking education campaigns and workshops to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. Counter-trafficking officials spoke regularly with anti-trafficking messages on radio talk shows and on television. The Ghana Immigration Service maintained a task force responsible for patrolling the borders and ports to expose crimes related to human trafficking. The government developed a draft for a national plan of action covering human trafficking. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly demolished Soldier Bar, a brothel in Accra known to have employed children in prostitution. Ghana is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.
