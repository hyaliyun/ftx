In his adulthood he modelled for Vincenzo Gemito, who presented him as a prototype of homoerotic masculine beauty. He was also known for his relationship with baron Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen. His life was novelized by the French writer Roger Peyrefitte in his work The Exile of Capri (L'exil√© de Capri) in 1959.  Biography  =Childhood and teenage years= Nino Cesarini was born into a working-class family in 1889. According to Peyreffite, Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd- Fersen, who had been forced to leave Paris after a homosexual scandal, met him in Rome on July 9, 1904, when Nino was a fourteen-year-old construction worker and newspaper-seller. Fersen obtained authorization from the boy's family to take Nino as his secretary with him to Capri. They lived together in Villa Lysis. In order to immortalize his beauty, the baron commissioned several artists to depict Nino. One of them was Umberto Brunelleschi, an Italian painter; another was the German painter Paul Hoecker, also exiled in Italy for the same (sexual) motives as those of Fersen. Finally, Fersen commissioned the famous sculptor Francesco Jerace to cast a statue of Nino in bronze, and placed it in the garden of the villa towards the sea. It was also repeatedly photographed by Wilhelm von Pl√ºschow, dressed as a Roman emperor and as a Christian saint. Copies of these photographs were widely circulated and it is possible that even Adelsw√§rd-Fersen sold them commercially. The only image of the Nino's statue by Jerace is von Pl√ºschow's photograph. In 1907 Fersen dedicated his work \\"Une Jeunesse / Les Baiser de Narcisse\\" to Nino, with the following phrase: \\"Dedicated to N. C. More beautiful than the light of Rome.\\" Nino's beauty made him attractive to other people. During the visit to Venice, he flirted with Alexandrine (Sacha) Ricoy Antokolsky, the daughter of the sculptor Mark Antokolsky, who even travelled back to Capri and finally managed to seduce him. Fersen reacted furiously with a volume of poems appropriately titled \\"So sang Marsyas\\" ‚Äì an exalted song of praise for Nino, since he was frightened by the thought that Nino would abandon him. This explosion of passion can only be understood from the idea of Jacques' fear of losing the young man, and the jealousy that fuelled this fear, of something that would never happen. An Italian poet and writer Ada Negri, who had visited the villa, published an article in 1923 in the newspaper L'Ambrosiano, shortly after the death of the baron, describing Nino with the following words: \\"The Villa was a place where everything was very beautiful, including Nino, the secretary, with the intense gaze of deep black eyes, crowned by well-shaped eyebrows.\\" At that time, Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen, Nino's protector and lover, was in a phase of great dependence on opium, a drug that he smoked more than thirty pipes a day. According to Peyrefitte he had built a special smoking room in Villa Lysis, called the China Room.Negri, Ada. \\"L‚Äôinutile belleza\\" publicado en \\"L‚ÄôAmbrosiano\\" (15 de diciembre de 1923), reimpreso en: Adeslw√§rd-Farsen, \\"Oppio Poesie Scelte\\", pp 87-105 y citado por Will H.L. Ogrinc en \\"Fr√®re Jacques: a shrine to love and Sorrow\\", 2006. =Later years= Will H. L. Ogrinc supposes in his work that as Nino grew up, the Baron d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen sought relationships with other young boys. As proof of this he uses Pl√ºschow's famous photograph in which a naked young man is seen lying on a sofa in the interior of Villa Lysis, on one of whose walls the famous painting that H√∂cker painted to exalt the beauty of Nino can be seen. According to him, the naked boy on the couch is not Nino, since he seems too young in comparison to the subject of the painting. Nino and Adelsw√§rd-Fersen travelled, at least a few times, to countries in the Far East. Apart from some temporary separations, for example during Nino's military service and his participation in the First World War, which was followed by a convalescence in the hospital due to the injuries he sustained there, Cesarini remained his entire life with the baron despite the fact that, over time, passion was replaced by friendship. According to Roger Peyrefitte, when he returned from the hospital he remained with Fersen only as a friend and secretary, and the baron's attempts to continue the sexual relationship were rejected by the then-mature Nino. Ogrinc in his turn, asserts that this statement of Peyrefitte, apart from not being documented, does not seem realistic, given the preference shown by Fersen for younger boys. Baron Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen died in 1923 of an overdose of cocaine dissolved in a glass of champagne. There are indications that it may have been suicide, although there has been no unanimity in that explanation. Dr. Gatti, the doctor who signed the death certificate, established a heart attack as the cause of death, which was not consistent with an overdose of cocaine. Trying to protect the inheritance, the baron's family spread the rumour that he had been poisoned by Nino, driven by jealousy at the last relationship that Fersen maintained with the Corrado Annicelli. Baron's sister and mother insisted on an autopsy. The Naples authorities decided to carry it out, after which they dismissed such accusations. According to the wishes of the late d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen, Nino received 300,000 francs and the right to the usufruct of the Villa Lysis. He later sold his rights to the Villa to Fersen's sister for 200,000 lire. His portrait painted by Brunelleschi and the statue of Jerace were, in turn, sold to a Swiss antiquary, and have since disappeared. According to the most widespread version of events, Nino returned to Rome where he established a newsstand and bar. Nino died in October 1943 at age 54, and was buried in the Roman cemetery of Campo Verano. However, other sources claim that after the sale of his rights to the Villa, together with the inheritance he received, Nino was rich enough to retire, as well as cultured and refined (he apparently spoke several languages), which makes it difficult to understand why he decided to sell newspapers in a kiosk. According to this other version, he died of an opium overdose. After his death, his family destroyed all the letters of Baron d'Adelsw√§rd, many of his photos and a collection of erotic objects.

Mutesa II of Buganda, Kabaka of Buganda,sent Kirya Balaki Kebba to look for a competent young person who would contest against Benedicto Kiwanuka Democratic Party (DP), Kirya with others identified Milton Obote and after instructing him how to behave before the King they introduced him to the Kabaka of Buganda. Kirya Balaki Kebba was Minister of State (for security) office of the president, a National Resistance Council Member, elected as a member of parliament in 1962; Appointed Minister without portfolio; Minister of Works in 1963; Minister of Mineral and Water among other. When, in the mid to late 1960s, Apollo Milton Obote was engaged in a power struggle with the President of Uganda, Kabaka Edward Mutesa II following the collapse of the Uganda People's Congress ‚Äì Kabaka Yekka (UPC-KY) alliance, five members of his Cabinet and ruling UPC party fell out with him. History indicates that Milton Obote discovered that Kirya was siding with Kabaka Mutesa II of which Kirya ultimately detained indefinitely without trial. Among those five Cabinet Minister's was Kirya, then Minister for Mineral and water Resources. The other break-aways included Milton Obote, William Nadiope, Adoko Nekyon and Grace Ibingira. Subsequently, Kirya became Bukedi North's representative to the LEGICO when the first batch of Ugandans was elected in 1961. He was among the Ugandan leaders, who went to London for the constitutional conference, which Uganda inherited at independence. In Kirunda Kivejinja's book Uganda: The Crisis of Confidence, Kirya Balaki Kebba features as one of the politicians, who ran the show on the eve of Independence and in the early Post-Independence years. In History of Uganda (1962-71), Kirya Balaki Kebba was appointed minister without portfolio but after two years, Milton Obote moved him to head the mineral and water resources ministry. But before independence Kirya Balaki Kebba and Grace Ibingira had been among the architects of the famous UPC/KY Alliance that had handed UPC leadership. Kirya's contemporaries have often stated that even as a minister, he did not become a blind follower of the leader, who was increasingly becoming fickle and erroneous because he was a veteran at local politics. As much as Kirya and Milton Obote were age-mates, he reportedly introduced Milton Obote into the political scene and they were very close to Bidandi Ssali, People's Progressive Party chairman; He was a conservative politician, an astute peace and reconciliation broker. After a stalemate, he and Grace Ibingira played a key role in creating a working relationship between UPC and Kabaka Yeka Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of Uganda at Kirya's eulogy (1994); He was a man of great experience and invaluable dedication to this country. Kirya Balaki Kebba dedicated his life to the fight for freedom, a cause for which he was persecuted but he persevered Matia Kasaija, planning State Minister was with Kirya in exile in Nairobi in the Republic of Kenya. Kirya Balaki Kebba was an astute and courageous politician, who disagreed with the Milton Obote II Government to the extent that he had to flee for safety into exile in the Republic of Kenya. Kirya was not given to political ideologism and dogma, criticizing the UPC government when it developed leftist-leanings. In February 1966 Milton Obote by then as a prime minister, was being pinned by the Uganda Parliament for involvement in an ivory and gold scandal, among those asking Milton Obote to clear his position was Kirya . Milton Obote reacted by imprisoning Kirya Balaki Kebba, Grace Ibingira, Dr.Lumu, M.Ngobi, Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor and G.Magezi all Government Minister's that wanted the Milton Obote to come to book. Many believe had the said six Minister's not been imprisoned, reforms that saw traditional kingdoms abolished and two undemocratic constitutions forced unto Uganda would not have been successful. Idi Amin released Kirya among the political prisoners whom he set free upon his coup in 1971. But shortly, he had to run for his life, as Idi Amin embarked on killed former Milton Obote Minister's. Balaki Kebba went into exile in the Republic Kenya, where he became part of the liberation struggles to oust Iddi Amin on condition that Milton Obote was not involved. After the liberation war in 1979, he was appointed director for the Eastern Region under Yusuf Lule's Government. However, the political situation remained unstable, and a couple of years later Balaki kebba was back at his Kenya residence in Jamuhuri estate as a political exile for the second time. Exile In 1981, Kirya Balaki Kebba and his cousin Katunku Nicholas being strong supporters of the Democratic Party went to exile in the Republic of Kenya after the 1981 Uganda elections. In 1982, at his at home in Jamuhuri Estate Nairobi, Opio among other Milton Obote's operative's kidnapped Kirya Balaki Kebba and took him to Wilson Airstrip in Nairobi where he was flown to Kisumu in Kenya and then bundled into a car and driven back to Uganda via Busia up to Luzira prison on grounds of involvement in rebel activities. Kirya Balaki kebba was charged together with Prof. Yoweri Kyesimira, with treason for their involvement in Dr. Andrew Kayiira's rebel outfit. He was later released and was among the people who participated in the Nairobi peace agreement at City Hall. Kirya was appointed as security state minister which was a position under the Office of the President. President Yoweri Museveni said, in his eulogy at Kirya's funeral, that the minister had been the most important player in winning for the new Government the approval of Western countries, which were initially hostile. Kirya was also a champion of traditional institutions and particularly was good friends with Kabaka Mutesa II. He remains one of the favourites of Mengo among the country's first crop of leaders, and two years ago the Kabaka of Buganda said a monument was to be erected at Bulange in commemoration of his dedicated friendship and service to the kingdom. Kirya's burning bridges with Obote set him on a path of sustained opposition of whatever he deemed as \\"bad leadership\\" in Uganda for the rest of his life, punctuated with several sacrifices. One would say that upon his death in 1994, he left behind a legacy of a dedicated nationalist. He had also come to see his Country back on a path to relative stability under the National Resistance Movement Government.

He played in the Football League for Cardiff City and Gillingham. Career Lloyd was born in 1958 in Wolverhampton. After playing football for Worcester City's youth and reserve teams, he moved into Sunday league football in Wolverhampton, from where he joined West Midlands (Regional) League club Darlaston in September 1978. He had no contract with Darlaston, preferring a non-contractual arrangement that let him continue playing Sunday football. He was out for a time through injury, before starting to attract attention early the following year. In March, Worcester City tried to re-sign him but he turned them down. Lloyd was then offered a trial with Football League club Cardiff City. Injury, for which he received daily treatment at nearby Walsall F.C., prevented him taking up the offer immediately, but it remained open, and he signed for Cardiff in May 1979. Because Darlaston had no contract with Lloyd, they were not entitled to a transfer fee. He was selected as the substitute for the visit to Notts County on the opening day of the 1979‚Äì80 Second Division season, and came on in place of Ray Bishop during a 4‚Äì1 defeat. The Sports Argus newspaper reported that \\"even the Darlaston officials [were] surprised by the speed of Lloyd's promotion.\\" That proved to be his only appearance for Cardiff's first team. He moved to Gillingham in July 1980, where he was top scorer for the reserve team during the 1980‚Äì81 season, but found it hard to break into the first team, playing only in one Football League game and an FA Cup game in which Gillingham suffered a shock defeat to non-League Maidstone United. He left Gillingham at the end of that season to return to Worcester City, for which he scored three goals from 35 appearances in the 1981‚Äì82 Alliance Premier League season. The following year he emigrated to Australia, where he played for Albion Rovers SC of the Victorian State League and for National Soccer League teams Brunswick Juventus, helping them reach the 1984 Southern Conference Finals, and Green Gully.

In 2011, following the band's reformation, Powerplay Magazine proclaimed, \\"The future is looking very good indeed for this now legendary band\\". History Nightlord Logo - Black Background =Formation= Friends Jamie Thorne and Ferenc Collins began discussing the idea of a band when Collins moved to London in late 1988. Thorne knew guitarist James Mackenzie and drummer Neil Wiseman, and invited them all to a jam session in May 1989. After this initial session, they decided that this combination would work, and they began writing songs with regular rehearsals for the next six months. Nightlord's first show was at the Jolly Gardeners pub in Isleworth on 6 December 1989. Once word had spread about Nightlord, their second show headlining the then well-renowned Brentford Red Lion the following month was a total sell out. The band went on to regularly play the UK circuit for the next four years, supporting such well-known acts as Skyclad, Paradise Lost, Nocturnus, Confessor, Korzus, Cerebral Fix, Decimator and Extreme Noise Terror. =Early recordings= Nightlord backstage at the Marquee Club in London after their first support slot to Decimator on 25 September 1990 In mid-1990 they entered Heatham House Studios in Twickenham to record eight songs, four of which were released as a demo tape, \\"Approaching Thunder\\", which sold over 500 copies. In April 1992, Nightlord recorded a single track for inclusion in a compilation 7\\" single, entitled, \\"The Unbreakable Oath\\". The single also features London bands Konkrete Gerbil, Dynamitte Inc and Mental Helicopters. =The Underground Titans Tour '92= Advert for The Underground Titans Tour '92 The Underground Titans Tour '92 was the brainchild of Nightlord guitarist Ferenc Collins and then Gomorrah guitarist Jose Griffin. Having seen the success of the Clash of the Titans tour featuring Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Suicidal Tendencies which took these bands out of the club circuit and into major arenas, the idea was to take five unsigned but successful bands and take them from the usual pub circuit into the club circuit. Featuring a rotating bill of; Decomposed, Gommorah, Incarcerated, Nightlord and The Reign the tour reached over 2000 people, culminating in a show at London's Marquee Club, and the tour is still universally recognised to this day as the first truly Underground Metal tour. The tour picked up considerable column inches in the only existing Heavy Metal publications of the day, Kerrang! and Metal Hammer, as well as a special article in The Sunday Times newspaper, exposure that was otherwise unheard of for unsigned bands at the time. =First line-up changes= James Mackenzie quit the band in July 1992, just before The Underground Titans Tour began so as a temporary measure, Kevin Fisher, long time friend of the band and guitarist for Konkrete Gerbil, stood in for the duration of the tour. Shortly after the tour, Nightlord recruited Ricky Needham who would remain until the band disbanded in April 1993. At the time the band was half-way through a recording session for a new demo tape, which was abandoned. =Reformation (2010 onwards)= Feeling a sense of unfinished business, the four original members of Nightlord met for the first time since disbanding in the summer of 2010, and before long, a comeback show was planned at London's Camden Underworld for December of that year. To mark the event, the original recording of \\"Approaching Thunder\\" was dusted down and released as a full album through Copro records. At the same time, the recording that was started in 1993 was completed and was the basis for the second album, \\"Cult of the Moon\\". This release featured four songs from this session, \\"Practice Makes Perfect\\" from \\"The Unspeakable Oath\\" session and six live tracks recorded at a show at the then-legendary Walthamstow Royal Standard in April 1992. Since then the band have gone on to appear alongside bands such as Sepultura, Onslaught, Gama Bomb, Annihilator and Artillery, completing some other unfinished business with Artillery, following a cancelled show with them from February 1991. It was shortly after the recording sessions of Reborn in Darkness that Nightlord announced Davide Marini had joined as a new permanent member on drums. =Reborn In Darkness (2017)= The original four members recorded their third album Reborn in Darkness during late 2015 / early 2016 and which was released in August 2017, featuring the first new songs for 24 years. Rhythm Guitarist Ferenc Collins speaking about the new album Reborn In Darkness; \\"This is not an album of 100 takes-per-song with guitars edited so tight it sounds ridiculously clinical. The finished result is glorious. In the process of preserving the old-school sound we have managed to make an album that really sounds organic and human.

The 276th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 30, 2016. The episode, while mostly working towards the season's conclusion, briefly reiterated the season's commentary on trolling. Plot As global panic over Troll Trace causes a large crowd to gather outside the barricaded SpaceX facility in hopes of escaping to Mars, Cartman confronts Butters over his advances on Heidi Turner. Butters reveals that he was doing so in order to get Cartman to break up with Heidi before she can break his heart. An increasingly panicked Cartman repeatedly asks Heidi to tell more jokes, but she concentrates fully on using her \\"emoji analysis\\" technique to solve the problems required to launch a Mars rocket. She is finally able to solve the problem, but Cartman's panic makes him doubt his relationship with Heidi. In Denmark, the Troll Trace CEO, now named Bedrager, has Gerald Broflovski and the rest of the trolling team stripped naked and brought to a holding room where Gerald presumes they will be killed. However, Bedrager then brings Gerald back to his control room where he explains that he is faking being a Dane and that he had really designed Troll Trace to set the entire world against each other just for laughs, as Gerald had done previously on a smaller scale. He then seals Gerald in the control room, as his locked-in Troll Trace workers and the trolling team watch each other simultaneously get rickrolled. After being caught and brought back home by their mother Sheila, Kyle and Ike decide to rally a panicking South Park to take vengeance on Troll Trace. They manage to convince Mr. Slave to anger President Garrison into bombing Denmark. However, when Sheila informs Kyle that his father Gerald is still in Denmark, Kyle then angers Garrison into calling off the attack. Kyle and Ike eventually lock Sheila, who has grown increasingly angrier, in the family pantry so they can use the computer against her wishes in order to take action.  Reception  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10, saying \\"South Park's 20th season delivered another winner, as the show went on the offensive against President Garrison.\\" Jeremy Lambert of 411 Mania rated it a 5.5 out of 10, stating \\"I've been disappointed with the overall lack of direction in the season.

A member of the Society of Mary (Marists), he worked in several Oceanic countries including Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, Wallis and Futuna, and later Australia and New Zealand. Biography Bishop Pierre Bataillon, Vicar Apostolic of Central Oceania Gatafahefa was born on Lakeba in the Lau Islands, Fiji, the son of Tongan parents. From the island of Tongatapu, his family were relatives of TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau, the later Tongan King George Tupou I. Gatafahefa converted to Roman Catholicism with his father. Baptized as Soakimi or Joachim, he spent most of his formative years on Futuna. He entered the school at Kolopelu, on Futuna, and then the Seminary of Lano, on Wallis, founded by the French Marist missionary priest, Bishop Pierre Bataillon, the Vicar Apostolic of Central Oceania. Recognizing his potentials, Bishop Bataillon took Gatafahefa with him to Sydney, Australia for further education. In 1856, he took him to Europe along with two other Polynesian students: a Rotuman named Rafaele and a Wallisian named Motesito. They visited France and Rome, Italy where Gatafahefa met Pope Pius IX. Staying in Rome, the three students attended the Propaganda College and studied to become priests. He was the only one of the Polynesian students to finish his studies and was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro on 10 June 1865 at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. Thus he became the first Polynesian to be ordained a priest. Despite his training in Europe, his later appointments in Tonga, Samoa, Wallis and Futuna were met with controversy. Encyclopedic sources claim that Bishop Bataillon believed that Gatafahefa was attempting to persuade the people of Futuna to distance themselves from European Roman Catholic clergymen. After these incidents, Gatafahefa was sent for retraining in Sydney and New Caledonia. Archbishop Redwood accepted him into the Archdiocese of Wellington as long as no mention was made of his past. So he subsequently lived and worked for twenty years in New Zealand most of them as a lay brother at the Marist Mission Station and later Seminary in Meeanee, where he was known as \\"Brother Joe.\\" He died on 24 May 1896, at the age of 58, and was buried in the Taradale Cemetery, Napier, Hawke's Bay; the name \\"Father Joachim Gata Gatafahefa\\" is now inscribed on his gravestone. After his death, although other Polynesians entered the priesthoods, no indigenous Tongans were ordained as Catholic clergymen until 1925.

This argumentation system has seven distinct semantic predicates which may be thought of as seven different truth values. Traditionally, in the Jaina and other Indian literature dealing with topics in Jain philosophy, this system of argumentation is referred to as Saptabhangivada or Syadvada. The earliest reference to Syadvada occurs is the writings of Bhadrabahu (c. 433‚Äì357 BCE). There is mention of Syadvada in the Nyayavatara of Siddhasena Divakara (about 480‚Äì550 CE). Samantabhadra (about 600 CE) gave a full exposition of the seven parts of Syadvada or Saptabhanginyaya in his Aptamimamsa. The Syadvadamanjari of Mallisena (1292 CE) is a separate treatise on the same theory. There are, of course, still later works and a large number of modern commentaries. (Dialectica 8, 1954, 95‚Äì111) The interpretation of Saptabhangivada as a seven-valued logic was attempted by Harvard University philosophy professor George Bosworth Burch (1902‚Äì1973) in a paper published in International Philosophical Quarterly in the year 1964. P. C. Mahalanobis, an Indian applied statistician, has given a probabilistic interpretation of the Saptabhangivada. (Dialectica 8, 1954, 95‚Äì111) The seven predicates The Saptabhangivada, the seven predicate theory may be summarized as follows: The seven predicate theory consists in the use of seven claims about sentences, each preceded by \\"arguably\\" or \\"conditionally\\" (syat), concerning a single object and its particular properties, composed of assertions and denials, either simultaneously or successively, and without contradiction. These seven claims are the following. # Arguably, it (that is, some object) exists (syad asty eva). # Arguably, it does not exist (syan nasty eva). # Arguably, it exists; arguably, it doesn't exist (syad asty eva syan nasty eva). # Arguably, it is non-assertible (syad avaktavyam eva). # Arguably, it exists; arguably, it is non-assertible (syad asty eva syad avaktavyam eva). # Arguably, it doesn't exist; arguably, it is non-assertible (syan nasty eva syad avaktavyam eva). # Arguably, it exists; arguably, it doesn't exist; arguably it is non- assertible (syad asty eva syan nasty eva syad avaktavyam eva). There are three basic truth values, namely, true (t), false (f) and unassertible (u). These are combined to produce four more truth values, namely, tf, tu, fu, and tfu(Three-valued logic). Though, superficially, it appears that there are only three distinct truth values a deeper analysis of the Jaina system reveals that the seven truth values are indeed distinct. This is a consequence of the conditionalising operator \\"arguably\\" denoted in Sanskrit by the word syat. This Sanskrit word has the literal meaning of \\"perhaps it is\\", and it is used to mean \\"from a certain standpoint\\" or \\"within a particular philosophical perspective\\". In this discussion the term \\"standpoint\\" has been used in a technical sense. Consider a situation in which a globally inconsistent set of propositions, the totality of philosophical discourse, is divided into sub- sets, each of which is internally consistent. Any proposition might be supported by others from within the same sub-set. At the same time, the negation of that proposition might occur in a distinct, though possibly overlapping subset, and be supported by other propositions within it. Each such consistent sub-set of a globally inconsistent discourse, is what the Jainas call a \\"standpoint\\" (naya). A standpoint corresponds to a particular philosophical perspective. In this terminology, it can be seen that the seven predicates get translated to the following seven possibilities. Each proposition p has the following seven states: # p is a member of every standpoint in S. # Not-p is a member of every standpoint in S. # p is a member of some standpoints, and Not-p is a member of the rest. # p is a member of some standpoints, the rest being neutral. # Not-p is a member of some standpoints, the rest being neutral. # p is neutral with respect to every standpoint. # p is a member of some standpoints and Not-p is a member of some other standpoints, and the rest are neutral.

He wrote many books on the New Thought movement. Trine was a close friend of Henry Ford and had several conversations with him about success in life. Trine attended several different colleges and universities. His studies were on writing, journalism, history, and social science. He took up work as a journalist and eventually became an author of many books in philosophy.  Early life  Born September 9, 1866, in Mount Morris, Illinois, Trine was the son of Samuel G. Trine and Ellen E. Newcomer. He attended public school, and after graduating from high school at the age of 16 he began work as a farmer and lumberjack. Later he worked as a bank teller for a time before going to college.  Education and career  Trine attended the University of Wisconsin in his early twenties and shows in the 1891 yearbook that covered 1889/90 and their alumni magazine of 1900.The Wisconsin alumni magazine, Volume 1 Number 5 (February 1900, p. 228) In his mid twenties he attended Knox College in Illinois and graduated receiving a Master of Arts degree in 1891. He then attended Johns Hopkins University studying history, social science, and political science where he concurrently worked as a journalist for the Boston Daily Evening Transcript. Trine earned a large cash prize for an essay he wrote in the late 1800s on how education lowered crime. He became involved in social problems related to animals and became director of the American Humane Society and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Trine was a vegetarian. Trine was both a student and teacher of rhetoric at Emerson College in 1892 where he had an influence on E. W. Kenyon, who went on to become the father of the Word of Faith Movement, an Evangelical Christian philosophy. He then moved to Mount Airy, New York area where he built a cabin when he was 30 years old in 1896. Situated near a grove of pine trees, the property provided an ideal environment for his writing talents. At this time he met his future wife Grace Hyde an author of poetry and plays. Living in the area for many years, while raising their only child, Robert, they became involved in metaphysical seminars that were held at Lake Oscawana. Later they moved to California and continued writing. He liked raising fruit trees as a hobby, which became a labor of love. Trine was influenced by writings of Emmet Fox, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Drummond. Trine's book What All the World's A-Seeking amplified on ideas and concepts Drummond brought up originally in his book, The Greatest Thing in the World and Other Addresses. Trine's primary work, In Tune with the Infinite was published in 1897. It has been translated into some twenty languages and millions of copies have been sold. It was a favorite of Queen Victoria and Janet Gaynor. Henry Ford attributed his automobile business and financial success to ideas he picked up from Trine's book. He gave away copies of Trine's book to executive industrialists he knew. Ford considered Trine an old friend and had several intimate conversations with him about life and success. He attributed many aspects of his success in life directly to these talks with Trine. A blood- stained copy of In Tune with the Infinite was found in the pocket of German war poet August Stramm after he was killed in action on the Eastern Front during World War I. Patrick Bridgwater (1985), The German Poets of the First World War, Croom Helm Ltd. Page 38. Trine was a philosopher and teacher besides being the author of many books related to the New Thought movement. He was introduced to the movement in the late nineteenth-century and was an advocate in the early twentieth-century of the related ideas. He was one of the first of its representatives to write books on it. His writings had an influence on other religious people including Ernest Holmes, a pioneer of Religious Science. Trine's books of the early twentieth-century on New Thought ideas have promoted and sold more than any other of this genre.

A boy imagines his pet fish tells him the story of evolution. Overview The 48-page book is drawn in 3 colors: red, blue and white. It was described as similar in style to Dr Seuss by some reviewers due to the simple drawing style and absurdity of the tale. It includes a timeline and author's note at the end for older children or parents who want material for further discussion. About the author Author-illustrator Tom Sullivan was a freelance graphic designer. This is the author's first book. The idea of the book came to him on a different project, ‚ÄúI was thinking about mammals and reptiles and eggs, when I got to frogs. I started to wonder how a frog who used to be a tadpole would describe that experience, and a title for a different story just popped into my head.‚Äù Reception *\\"In this engaging introduction to the concept of evolution, an unseen narrator describes how he changed from fish to land animal and beyond, eventually becoming a modern boy at the end of the book. Simple, expressive cartoon drawings depict each stage with humor and purpose. Bold lines, plentiful white space, and careful use of just two colors provide clarity and focus throughout the progression. ... The tone is lighthearted but not overdone, with humorous shifts of facial expressions and postures as the world changes with each page turn. When viewers meet the boy at the end, they also spot the pet fish that must have triggered his imaginative musings. Though clearly inspired by evolution, the fanciful story is not an attempt to accurately represent the scientific process, as an author's note confirms. ...

It protects an isolated area of well-preserved Atlantic Forest on the Atlantic coast near the city of S√£o Paulo. Location The Xixov√°-Japu√≠ State Park has an area of . It is divided between the municipalities of Praia Grande with , and S√£o Vicente with . Of this, is land and is marine. The park is on the sea shore, isolated from the Serra do Mar, and protects biodiversity in an area that is heavily affected by housing, industry and port activities. History The first European settlement in the area was in 1510. The town of S√£o Vicente, just north of the park, was officially founded on 22 January 1532, the first Vila in Brazil. The region was mainly agricultural with a small population until the middle of the 19th century. The port of Santos, beside S√£o Vicente, began to expand from 1845 with the growth of the coffee trade. Banana plantations and other fruit orchards were established, and a tannery exploiting tannin from the mangroves. In 1902 construction of the Fortaleza de Itaipu was launched in the south of the park area. During the 20th century the population of the Santos region increased greatly due to the port and industrial development, but the Japu√≠ area holding the park was not occupied apart from a real estate development called \\"Parque Prainha\\" launched in 1928. From the 1950s the beach community of Praia Grande to the west of the park started to be developed in an uncontrolled manner. The tannery was closed in the 1970s, and infrastructure such as electricity, water, sewage and paved roads were gradually introduced in the communities round the park area. The Xixov√°-Japu√≠ State Park was created by the state governor Lu√≠s Ant√¥nio Fleury Filho by decree 37.536 of 27 September 1993 with the goal of providing complete protection of the remaining ecosystems it contained. Environment The park protects one of the best preserved fragments of Atlantic Forest in Baixada Santista. The vegetation is dense submontane and lowland rainforest, beach vegetation, restinga, and vegetation associated with the rocky shores. The rainforest is well-preserved, in an advanced stage of succession, with some evidence of selective logging in the past. The forest includes of dense submontane rainforest and of lowland rainforest. A 2014 survey of flora found 13 pteridophyte and 312 spermatophyte species in 85 families and 220 genera, including 112 species of trees. Threatened species were Euterpe edulis, Tabebuia cassinoides, Protium kleinii, Swartzia flaemingii, Lobelia anceps, Ocotea odorifera, Hibiscus bifurcatus, Brosimum glaziovii and Pharus latifolius. The survey reported Erythroxylum catharinense Amaral and Beilschmiedia fluminensis Kosterm for the first time for S√£o Paulo State. A total of 457 plant species have been identified, comprising 106 families and 294 genera. Of these 13 species are threatened with extinction. 319 species of vertebrate have been identified, including 13 terrestrial mammals, 21 marine mammals, 87 birds, 21 amphibians, 35 terrestrial reptiles, 5 marine reptiles and 137 fish. There are records of 68 taxa of zooplankton, in addition to phytoplankton, consolidated and non-consolidated benthos. Human impact There are three beaches, and trails used by surfers. Traces of past occupation are the old tannery and a quarry. The park is monitored systematically for environmental problems. Visitors should be accompanied by monitors and employees of the protection and maintenance program, but this is not always the case. The park is often used by researchers. Threats come from the population living within the park, hunting, illegal extraction of forest products, fishing, incursions by domestic animals, release of exotic animals, military activities in the area of the park that overlaps with the Itaipu fortress, and indigenous people occupying the Paranapu√£ beach from 2004.

He was awarded a CBE in 2011 for his services to medicine. Career Born in Ystradgynlais, Wales, Hopkin attended Maesydderwen School before proceeding to the Welsh National School of Medicine in Cardiff, graduating MB in 1972.http://www.wales.nhs.uk/documents/W080152-Hlt.pdf He proceeded with his postgraduate clinical training in Cardiff, Oxford and Edinburgh, including a career-influencing period with John Crofton, the initiator of successful combination chemotherapy for tuberculosis. Hopkin undertook scientific training (Master and Doctorate) at the University and Medical Research Council Human Genetics (MRC Human Genetics Unit) in Edinburgh. In Edinburgh, with John Evans, he described the potent mutagenic actions of cigarette smoke on human cells - going on to quantify the mutagenic and cytotoxic actions of cigarette smoke and their relationship to lung cancer and pulmonary emphysema risks respectively. Hopkin spent periods in pulmonary medicine practice, in medical student teaching (Fellow and Supervisor of clinical students at Brasenose College, Oxford, 1992‚Äì99), and in research at Birmingham and Oxford. In those periods he developed a robust bronchoscopic lavage method to secure precise microbial diagnostics and improved survivals for pneumonia in immuno-suppressed subjects. With Anne Wakefield, he settled the fungal taxonomic status of the important opportunistic pathogen, pneumocystis, and devised a precise mitochondrial rRNA diagnostic for pneumocystis pneumonia, applicable to simple non-invasive simple clinical samples and adopted worldwide. With the rise in asthma prevalence (1980-2000), Hopkin undertook highly collaborative work addressing the underlying causes. He showed that common up-regulating genetic variants of Th2 immune signalling related to allergic disorder and high IgE levels (sharing, with Dr Taro Shirakawa, the 2001 Daiwa-Adrian Prize in Medicine) but also to low burdens of parasitic work infestation - proposing an evolutionary mechanism in which prevalent parasitic worm infection has provided long term evolutionary selection for up-regulating genetic variants of Th-2 immunity. He contributed epidemiologic data that relate diminished bacterial exposures in early childhood (less tuberculosis; more oral antibiotic receipts) to increased allergic disorder. His current work builds on the latter and focuses on how bacterial exposures shape human immunity relevant to asthma, and how unravelling these microbial mechanisms may provide disease preventing agents.

It can control the temperature, moisture, and especially light regime of the plant based on light emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs have efficient electric lighting with desired wavelengths (Red+Blue) which support greenhouse production in a minimum time and with high quality and quantity. As LEDs are cool it helps plants to be placed as close as possible to light sources without overheating or scorching. This saves space for intense cultivation. It could provide the opportunity of greenhouse-produced fruits and vegetable to be available for the market more quickly and less expensively due to the effect of LED lighting on earliness, compactness and quality of products . Incandescent and fluorescent lamps currently available for lighting greenhouse, phytotrones and plant incubators emit color bands that may cause unwanted stem elongation and low quality in plant species, are electrically inefficient, short-lived, and particularly not eco-friendly for having hazardous waste disposal issues. On the other side, high-pressure sodium (HPS) discharge lamps have been well established in the greenhouses for their sufficient light intensities which support transplants and seedlings growth and development. Unfortunately, they have also many drawbacks. They are intensely hot and scorch nearby plant tissues, consume high electrical energy and as fluorescent lamps do not emit the exact required light wavelengths for optimum plant growth Scientific experiments A large number of plant species have been assessed in greenhouse trials to make sure plants have higher quality in biomass and biochemical ingredients even higher or comparable with field conditions.

Built about 1887, it is the only known surviving work of Chester James Wood, a local builder of some reputation, and is the town's only significant surviving example of Second Empire architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Theodore Wood House stands in a rural part of western Marshfield, on the north side of Hollister Hill Road, just west of Eaton Cemetery Road. It is a 2-1/2 story plank-framed structure, with its main block topped by a mansard roof, and a side gable-roofed ell. It is set on a granite foundation, and its walls are sheathed in wide wooden clapboards. The main block has a bracketed cornice and matchstick frieze. The formal entrance is sheltered by a broad single-bay porch, with chamfered square posts and a carved frieze and brackets. A second porch extends across the front of the ell, which features dormers with tall steeply pitched Gothic roofs. The interior of the house, like the exterior, features highly detailed fine quality woodwork. with The house was built, probably in 1887, to a design by Chester Wood, and is the rural community's only significant example of Second Empire architecture. Wood, who was nineteen at the time, is known to have built a number of impressive buildings in Marshfield and other Vermont communities, of which none definitely attributable to him have survived except for this house. The interior woodwork was executed at least in part by Abie Wood, Chester's younger brother. The Wood family was relatively prosperous, but subsequent owners were not, and the house declined in condition with the fortunes of its owners, until it underwent a major restoration beginning in the 1980s. The effect of this ownership patterns meant that only relatively modest alterations (mainly for the introduction of plumbing and electricity) were made to the house during those years.

It was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 on 20 September 2016 followed by Xbox One on 23 September 2016 and Nintendo Switch on 9 April 2018. The Bunker is Splendy Games' first major title as an independent games studio after having released the FMV zombie horror video game The Hunting on iOS and Android devices. The Bunker features the writers and designer of adventure video games, including The Witcher, Broken Sword and SOMA. Gameplay The game's player follows the daily routine of the main protagonist, John (played by Adam Brown), who grew up in a fallout shelter in Britain following a nuclear war. When an alarm is triggered, the player has to guide John around the bunker to venture into forgotten areas, recovering his repressed memories and unlocking the secrets of the bunker. The player is presented with live action footage throughout the entire game, with a point and click style of adventure gameplay. Utilising a third and first person camera, the player is presented with both flashback sequences and present day footage of an underground nuclear bunker. Development After releasing The Hunting, Splendy Games set out to create a more ambitious live action game with an increased budget and significantly higher production values. The Bunker was filmed entirely at the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker in Essex, England over 15 days, with the entire game development spreading over a year. For the main characters, Splendy Games hired a cast of actors including Adam Brown who had played Ori in The Hobbit film series, and Sarah Greene who played Hecate Poole in the Penny Dreadful TV series and who also voiced Anne Bonny in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. The game also stars Grahame Fox who had portrayed Ralf Kenning in the Game of Thrones and Jerome St. John Blake who played various characters in Star Wars. Reception = Critical reception= The Bunker received mostly positive or mixed reviews following the launch. Review aggregator Metacritic shows an average score of 68 out of 100 for the PlayStation 4 version, and 66 out of 100 for the Xbox One version. Praise was particularly directed at the game's narrative, and the actors' performance. However, the game's lack of interactivity was often criticised. GamesRadar's David Roberts lauded the game's sound design and music, remarking that \\"the John Carpenter-ian strains of its synths and the quality foley work help sell some of its more distressing moments... Playing in the dark with my headphones in, this scene got under my skin in a way few games have\\" Anthony John Agnello visited the game for GamesRadar and called it \\"PS4's freakiest post-apocalyptic game\\". After naming the game as \\"the strangest game played at Gamescom 2016\\", IGN's Joe Skrebels said \\"it's really weird and interesting and exactly the kind of thing you come to these kind of conventions to see.\\" Stephen Turner of Destructoid praised the atmospheric mood of the game, \\"The Bunker perfectly captures John‚Äôs sense of claustrophobia and paranoia with intense close-ups, security footage, and just a really good use of lighting.\\" However, Xbox Achievement's Richard Walker disagreed with this concluding \\"A linear interactive drama that fails to engender any sense of genuine drama or tension.\\" A mixed review by Eurogamer's Christian Donlan spoke highly of the production, stating \\"it affords this production the means of incorporating a real Cold War bunker which, as Martin mentioned in his preview, is the true star of the show: a place both echoey and claustrophobic, and grimly evocative of old-school Britain in its range of institutional greens and greys\\". However, he went on to criticise the game's limited gameplay aspects, saying \\"The Bunker is a fairly simple-minded game ‚Äì at most you will be tasked with finding the odd key in order to proceed through the linear plot ‚Äì and while it's often a memorable one, that's more down to its setting and throw-back tech than its design or its narrative.\\" = Accolades = The Bunker has received three award nominations at the TIGA Games Industry Awards 2016 for Most Original Game, Audio Design and Game of the Year References External links * Adventure games Interactive movie video games Full motion video based games Indie video games 2016 video games Windows games MacOS games Xbox One games PlayStation 4 games Nintendo Switch games IOS games Android (operating system) games Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Bunker (video game)"},{"id":"52409875","text":"Marie McGinn is a philosopher working in philosophy of mind and Wittgenstein.

Crispin Gurholt, Live Photo Lillehammer, Lillehammer Art Museum, 2012, The models, posing in a frozen photographic moment, are viewed by the audience through a natural or artificial barrier such as a shop window or a sheet of mounted plexiglass. The live performances normally have a duration of two hours. A Live Photo starts as a live performance; the performance is then photographed and filmed; and later translated into paintings and texts. Through this combination of formats, new stories and layers of meaning emerge. Live Photo subjects throw a critical light on society's repressive mechanisms and power hierarchies, such as racism, domestic violence and issues raised by globalised economic or institutionalised structures. Live Photo deals with the relation between reality and fiction and the idea of time, moment and memory. Live Photo can also be seen in the context of the historical tableau vivant.

In the first decades of automobile manufacturing until World War II, it was the German custom of their buying a chassis complete with an engine and take it to a coachbuilder to add a custom-built body to it. One of coachbuilders was Georg Autenrieth, who founded his company in 1921 in Weinsberg near Heilbronn and moved it in 1925 to 72 Feldbergstra√üe, Darmstadt. Customized orders were made for individual sedans, coup√©es, convertibles and custom-made products on chassis of various well-known pre-war automotive manufacturers such as Adler, Audi, Horch, Maybach, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, NSU, and R√∂hr-Werke in Ober-Ramstadt near Darmstadt. In 1930s BMWs also got a customized body by Autenrieth. In late 1930s and early 1940s, a smaller lot of convertibles were produced, based on the chassis of the first KdF car, the later Volkswagen Beetle. During the war, manufacturing of car bodies was discontinued and the company became an armory supplier. In the reconstruction phase after World War II, the cooperation with BMW was resumed. The cars of the time, which were built on a chassis, continued to be used for other superstructures, supporting the body itself. In 1950 founder Georg Autenrieth died. In that decade coup√©s and convertibles were built on the basis of the large BMW models. Convertibles, known as \\"Cabriolet\\" were also produced on early Citro√´n DS models as well as Borgward Isabella. More well-known are from the last years of the company Autenrieth convertibles and coup√©s based on different Opel models like Opel Olympia, Opel Rekord and Opel Kapit√§n.

She was executed in Berlin on 16 December 1943. Life lakeside camping place where they often stayed. Predating the collapse of the Nazi r√©gime, it is one of the earliest public memorials in Germany to Nazi victims. It was renovated - washed and repainted - in 2013. The memorial enjoys \\"protected\\" status. Charlotte \\"Lotte\\" Schaepe was born in Berlin. Following a commercial apprenticeship she took a job as an accountant. When, in 1933, she married the building worker (later a builder's draftsman) Erich Garske, it was her second marriage. She already had a child from her first marriage which in 1930 had ended in divorce. Lotte Garske was a member of the Communist Party of Germany. It was through party work, and shared membership of the Fichte Sports Association, that she had met Erich. Following abrupt r√©gime change in January 1933 Germany was rapidly transformed into a one-party dictatorship. After the Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933, the government instantly blamed \\"communists\\" and targeted for surveillance or arrest people who had been listed as Communist party members before the rules had been changed. However, the Garskes neither stopped being communists nor emigrated. Indeed, when the Communist Party in exile smuggled people back into Germany from Moscow or Paris to work on party matters, one of the places where they might be hidden and accommodated was in the Garskes' apartment in central Berlin. As early as 1934 they secretly accommodated , a close party colleague of Robert Stamm. From 1942 their Berlin apartment was the work-place and a communications hub for \\"Alfred\\". Erich Garske was able to help Alfred in his work by producing satirical drawings and other art work for illegal party publications, notably with a news journal called \\"Der Friedensk√§mpfer\\" (\\"The Fighter for Peace\\"). Gestapo reports indicated that Charlotte Garske was suspected of being significantly more important to the political work of \\"Alfred\\" than her husband. She acted as a courier, delivering illegal published material to Willi Seng, a party instructor and co-ordinator in the economically and politically crucial Ruhr region. She also organised meetings of others operating on behalf of the exiled communist party central committee. \\"Alfred\\" was the code name used by Wilhelm Kn√∂chel, an exceptionally effective communist resistance organiser. By the end of 1944 none of the people named above was alive. Erich Garske and Wilhelm Kn√∂chel were arrested at the Garskes' home by the Gestapo on 30 January 1943. Charlotte was arrested on 17 February 1943. On 9 November 1943 the special \\"People's Court\\" sentenced Erich and Charlotte Garske to death.

The organization was established in 1989 on the eve of the Namibia's independence from South Africa. Sister Namibia advocates for women's rights and engages in activities that promote full gender equality in a world free from violence, discrimination, and oppression. From its inception, the organization's main function has been to produce Sister Namibia Magazine. In the 1990s Sister Namibia expanded its operations to include educational programs, research, activism, media engagement, and cultural activities in support of women's rights.  History  = Origins = The formation of the Sister Namibia Collective follows the story of Namibia's liberation. Following World War I, the League of Nations mandated that Namibia, known then as South West Africa, be governed by South Africa. Not only was apartheid imposed under South African rule, but women's rights were restricted as well. Considered legal minors, married women could only engage in legal transactions with their husband's permission. Namibian women played key political and military leadership roles in the long fight for independence and these leaders ensured that women's rights became part of the liberation platform. When Namibia won independence in 1990, the new constitution guaranteed ‚Äúthe equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family . . . regardless of race, colour, ethnic origin, sex, religion, creed or social or economic status.‚Äù Human rights protections under the law, however, were not always visible in practice. The Sister Namibia Collective was formed by Elizabeth Khaxis and Liz Frank out of their realization that many women in Namibia did not even know that they had human rights. The Sister Namibia Collective's aim was to provide education and information about women's legal rights and to provide resources and skills so that women could claim their rights. The Collective functioned informally in the early years without a building or paid staff. Its main function at that time was to publish Sister Namibia Magazine ‚Äúto speak out against all forms of oppression and discrimination against women, and to write women back into Namibian history.‚Äù The magazine was created with scanty resources by volunteers who met at member's houses. The current director is Vida de Voss. = LGBTIQ Advocacy = In 1993 the Sister Namibia Collective broadened its advocacy aims to become the first Namibian organization to actively defend the rights of lesbian and gay people. Sister Namibia Magazine began to include stories about the lives and struggles of lesbians and bisexual women while the Collective became an outspoken challenger of homophobia in the news. Homosexuality had not been an issue of public debate in the early years of Namibia's independence, but after Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe‚Äôs denouncement of homosexuals as ‚Äúlower than pigs and dogs‚Äù and ‚Äúun-African‚Äù in 1995 became widely publicized, Namibian officials followed suit. In October 1995 Hadino Hishongwa, Namibia's Deputy Minister for Lands, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation, told a reporter that homosexuality was akin to ‚Äúcancer or AIDS‚Äù and recommended that homosexuals be ‚Äúoperated on to remove unnatural hormones.‚Äù Sister Namibia issued a response backed by Namibia's constitution: ‚ÄúWe believe that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as heterosexuals in all spheres of life.‚Äù In December 1996 at the third South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) Women's Congress in Gobabis, Namibian President Sam Nujoma went off script from his prepared speech and warned that homosexual elements were exploiting Namibia's democracy and declared that ‚Äúall necessary steps must be taken to combat influences that are influencing us and our children in a negative way. Homosexuals must be condemned and rejected in our society.‚Äù Sister Namibia demanded that Nujoma apologize and called for Namibians to ‚Äústand up together now and speak out against this or any other kind of hate speech and oppression against any member of our communities.‚Äù p. 53. For its resolve in standing up to government officials in defense of sexual minority rights, and for its inclusion of lesbian and bisexual voices in Sister Namibia Magazine, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) awarded Sister Namibia with the 1997 Felipa de Souza Award.Ashley McAllister (2007). The Visibility of Sexual Minority Movement Organizations in Namibia and South Africa (Ph.D. thesis). University of Pittsburgh. p. 59. In early 1997, in reaction to the homophobic remarks made by President Sam Nujoma, Sister Namibia provided meeting space and helped found The Rainbow Project, an advocacy and support network for lesbians and gay men in Namibia.  Education and media  = Sister Namibia Magazine = Sister Namibia Magazine has been published multiple times a year since 1989 in three languages: English, Afrikaans, and Oshiwambo. The magazine is used to \\"raise awareness among women, men and young people of the ways in which political, social, cultural, legal and economic systems of power control girls and women.\\" It includes profiles of influential women along with op-ed articles, reviews from books included in their resource center, and informational articles detailing topics such as violence against women, women in Namibian government, and women's health issues. The magazine is distributed quarterly throughout Namibia. A subscription form is available on their website for international orders. An archive of editions dating back to the first one, published July 1989, is available on their website as well. Sister Namibia's aim with the magazine is to bring focus to issues Namibian women face. They also want women to be able to express themselves through written and art pieces, be aware of issues like xenophobia and economic exploitation, and to challenge oppression through education. = Resource Center = Sister Namibia's main office houses a library with over 2,000 books on a vast array of topics, including women's rights, sexuality, gender, and violence. The main goals of the resource center are to keep it maintained with books and documents on gender and women's issues, including the women's movement of Namibia. These resources are collected from local and international women's groups and research institutions. They also aim to be able to efficiently distribute the resources collected to other women's groups and NGOs. = Social media = Sister Namibia has been running a blog, hosted on their website, since February 2013. On this blog, they post about current events, feminist issues, and activism opportunities. They also include op-ed pieces from interns, staff, and friends on the organization. Sister Namibia also runs another blog specifically for contributions from their readers. Found here are poems and think pieces submitted by individuals familiar with Sister Namibia.There is a third blog, entitled Sister Namibia as well, which is hosted on Blogspot. Sister Namibia states that they use the internet to ‚Äúmake stories, get in contact with other women‚Äù. Sister Namibia also runs a YouTube page, on which they have videos detailing feminist issues such as rape in marriage and sexual harassment. They conduct social experiments with interviews of the witnesses included in the videos. On their Facebook page, Sister Namibia shares posts from their website and from others around Africa. They also post pictures from their community outreach and activism meetings and programs. In addition, they share relevant YouTube videos. While Sister Namibia recognize the importance of the internet and social media, a lack of resources and knowledge presents constructional challenges for optimal networking. = Forums and Workshops = Sister Namibia works in coalition with many different NGO groups and organizations to bring awareness, education, and activism on a variety of issues. Past projects have included working with Ombetja Yehinga Organisation (OYO) to hold dance events to educate the public about important issues including the alarming statistics of \\"baby dumping\\", where newborn babies are abandoned on the street, HIV/AIDS, gender based violence, and teenage pregnancy. Sister Namibia has also collaborated with Women and Child Protection Unit (WCPU) in Katutura, Windhoek, an organization that houses women and children who have been victims of domestic violence and abuse. Sister Namibia sponsored a drive aired on One Africa Television in order to collect donations of baby clothes, shoes, and household items for mothers who are in need. Sister Namibia founder Elizabeth Khaxas has been very active in the public sphere. On the celebration of the first Girl Child Day in 2000, Khaxas gave a speech stating: \\"The time has come for young women to speak for themselves, in their own voices,‚Äù and sponsored a petition in support of domestic violence and child support legislation. In 2003 Sister Namibia played a key role in the revival of Katutura Community Radio (now BASE FM 106.2). For more than five years the organization hosted the weekly radio show Women's Voices \\"to provide greater access to the media to women and girls of all walks of life, including from marginalised communities.\\"  Initiatives  = 16 Days of Activism = The 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence is an international campaign that began in 1991. For sixteen days between November 25 and December 10 activists hold events and promote the principle that women's rights are human rights. In Namibia, Sister Namibia has worked with the National Ministry for Gender Equality and Child Welfare to host events with Sandy Rudd, the Bank Windhoek Theatre School, Free Your Mind Entertainment and Spoken Word. Sister Namibia values the importance of art as an outlet to raise awareness about the prevalence of gender violence. The slogan used by Sister Namibia is ‚ÄúArts United.\\" = Orange Day Campaign = Sister Namibia is a partner in the United Nations‚Äô campaign: UNite Campaign Orange Day Action Plan. The campaign was established to raise awareness and fight gender based violence inflicted on women and girls. The color orange is essential to the campaign, reflecting the optimism and hopeful attitude for a world without violence for women and girls; participants in Sister Namibia wear orange on the 25th day of each month as well as on International Day, November 25 of each calendar year. Sister Namibia acts in solidarity with the U.N., along with other governments, NGOs, and private corporations to engage with celebrities, athletes, and others with powerful voices in communities across the globe. Sister Namibia promotes the goals of the Orange Day Campaign by connecting women with legal resources to fight violence. = SisterPADS Program = The SisterPADS program run by Sister Namibia is committed to bringing agency and mobility to menstruating school girls and women by providing re-usable pads. The project was created in part to overcome the problem in Namibia where girls miss an average of three school days every month due to lack of menstrual pads. Sister Namibia believes that no girl should have to stay home because she can‚Äôt afford pads. SisterPADS are made of cotton and waterproof polyurethane laminate material and are manufactured in the United States. The material is not only reusable, but soft, stretchy, flexible, and durable. A representative from Sister Namibia says: ‚Äúthey have no reports of discomfort or allergies.‚Äù Some of the girls in the SisterPADS program who previously used pillow stuffing and other materials prior to the implementation of the program are now attending school and engage in social activities without fear of embarrassment. SisterPADS has provided menstrual pad kits to approximately seven hundred and sixty girls in Namibia through donations and support across the globe and is anticipating to expand their reach.

In 1926, he obtained a bachelor's degree with distinction from the University of South Carolina. In 1929, he obtained a law degree from Harvard Law School, and, in 1931, a masters of law degree. At Harvard, he studied under Felix Frankfurter. He passed the New York Bar exam in 1930.  Career  Polier began to champion civil rights causes in response to lynchings in the South, starting in his hometown. In 1931, Polier prepared legal briefs on behalf of the Scottsboro Boys. That case led him to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): he served on the Executive Committee of the NAACP's Legal and Educational Defense Fund for thirty years. At inception in 1931, he served as executive director of the International Juridical Association, with Carol Weiss King secretary, and Joseph Kover editor of its monthly bulletin. (In 1932, he met his wife there. ) A congressional report found that \\"examination of the bulletin reveals consistent support of Communist legal cases during its entire career.\\" In 1934, Polier appeared before a congress committee to recommend legislative language that would clarify the right to strike. In 1934, he served on the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) as a trial counselor. (Ware Group member Nathan Witt served as the NRLB's secretary.) In 1937, in the matter of Brown v. United States regarding mail fraud, he and Emil Weitzner supported Samuel H. Kaufman in appeal for petition against William W. Barron, US Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed, Assistant Attorney General Brien McMahon, and W. Marvin Smith for the United States. In 1943 (OSS - CIA) and 1968 (FBI), the Federal government investigated him. In 1945, he became chairman of the Commission on Law and Social Action (CLSA) at the American Jewish Congress (which he helped to found) and served such until 1955. CLSA conducted legal battles against antisemitism, segregation, racism, and other discriminatory laws. He won a six-year battle against antisemitic job practices by the Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO, current \\"Saudi Aramco\\"). In 1946, he prosecuted Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons for discrimination in admissions policies against Jews and other minority students. In 1947, the first statewide Fair Education Practices Law for which he fought, to end discrimination in admissions to colleges and universities on the basis of race or religion, passed into law. In 1948, he personally sued Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for discriminatory practices in its Stuyvesant Town Development in New York City, specifically not admitting African-Americans. The original case was dismissed, but the American Jewish Congress (of which Polier was the vice president) continued to fight for fair housing laws. Polier helped on Brown vs. Board of Education case with briefs of amici curiae to support student rights to obtain equal education. Personal life and death Polier \\"emphasized the strong parallels between the African-American and Jewish experiences and his belief that liberty and freedom can exist only when all citizens hold equal rights.\\" He served the World Jewish Congress, including its Executive and Governing Council), chair of its budget and finance commission, and honorary chair of its national governing council. He also served on the boards of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany and of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture.

By the time she was 15, she had started to write about how difficult it was for her to accept the way women were treated in her family and more generally in the community as a whole. She nevertheless studied accounting at Manouba University's Higher Institute of Accounting and Business, graduating in 2010. While a student, she played a leading role in various organizations, including Junior Chamber International and AIESEC, where by arranging events she gained experience of issues such as environment, health care, education, human rights and social exclusion. She learnt how to manage a team, raise funds and negotiate partnerships. Recognizing her potential, the US Embassy gave her a scholarship to follow a business management course at Tunisia's Mediterranean School of Business which she completed in 2010. Thanks to a scholarship from the Ecole Sup√©rieure de Commerce, she then went on to earn a master's degree at Marouba in 2013.

He usually appears with Shunfeng'er as a guardian of the temples of the sea goddess Mazu. Name The name \\"Qianliyan\\" literally means \\"He of the Thousand-Mile\\" or \\"League Eyes\\" but may be taken more generally as \\"Hawkeye\\", \\"Lynx-Eyed\\",. \\"Far-Seeing\\",. or even \\"All-Seeing\\" or \\"Clairvoyant\\". as a distance of 1,000 li was idiomatic in Chinese for any great distance.. It also appears as . and . His partner Shunfeng'er's name similarly means \\"Sharp-Eared\\" or \\"All-Hearing\\". Under the Ming, Qianliyan was also known as LiLou. History Qianliyan is first attested in the early-16th century novel Journey to the West, where he appears as the personified form of the Taoist Jade Emperor's eyes and one of his lieutenants. There is, however, an earlier depiction of him in the caves of Shimen Sh√≠m√©nshƒÅn) in Sichuan which has been dated to the Southern Song.. The Chinese folk tale about the Ten Brothers also probably long predates its first publication during the Ming Dynasty; in it, the eldest two brothers have powers just like those of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er.. Qianliyan next appeared as a lieutenant of the Emperor of Flowering Brightness Hu√°guƒÅng D√†d√¨) in Yu Xiangdou's Journey to the South and as a character in Xu Zhonglin's Creation of the Gods. He was confused with the door god Shenshu Shƒìnsh≈´) and, particularly, gradually conflated with the earlier sea god Zhaobao Qilang ZhƒÅob«éo Qƒ´l√°ng) as he was supplanted by the cult of Mazu. Religion stories Qianliyan's sharp vision is employed to help protect sailors at night and during fog and other inclement weather. In some accounts, he is capable of seeing everything in the world.. Qianliyan is most often portrayed as a demon defeated and tamed or befriended by the sea goddess Mazu. By one account, he and Shunfeng'er appeared off Meizhou Island during a storm and were defeated by Mazu's magical silk scarf, which blew clouds of sand into their eyes and ears. After their submission, they pledged their loyalty when she kindly healed them of the damage she had caused them.. In another, the two were Song generals who competed for her hand at Peach Blossom Mountain T√°ohuƒÅ ShƒÅn) but were both defeated by her kung fu.. In another, the two were the brothers Gao Ming and Gao Jue. Ruthless generals, they fell at Peach Blossom Mountain and subsequently haunted it as demons. They appeared to Mazu when she traveled nearby and challenged her to battle, with the loser to do the winner's bidding. They intended to have her marry them both but were defeated by her magic and became her servants.. In still another, the Gao brothers were bandits during the Shang before they began to haunt the mountain.. In still another account, the pair were originally warriors or guards of King Zhou of Shang. In this version of the story, they are sometimes said to have already possessed their superhuman powers and to have used them to foil the first moves towards rebellion by the Zhou. Ji Fa's advisor Jiang Ziya is made out to have been a Taoist adept, however, who uses the esoteric knowledge he received from the Primordial Lord of Heaven on to defeat them. Their powers fail them when he covers them in the blood of a black dog and Ji Fa is able to triumph at Muye and finally establish himself as the Martial King of Zhou (\\"King Wu\\"). Legacy Actors portraying Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er during a parade in Taipei. =Worship= Qianliyan most often appears as a door god at Mazuist temples or as a guardian beside Mazu at her altars or on her yellow paper charms. He is separately worshipped in some villages and by mariners for assistance avoiding danger. During the 8-day, annual pilgrimages from Dajia to Beigang, Mazu's idol is accompanied by figures of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er played by masked men on stilts.. =In art= Qianliyan typically appears as a green-skinned demon shielding his eyes from the sun's glare. This was not his original position: The Southern Song statue mentioned above and another in the Nanhai Longwang Temple N√°nh«éi L√≥ngw√°ng Mi√†o) in eastern Guangzhou in Guangdong give him three eyes but do not have either of his hands raised to his brow. He apparently picked up the pose from the earlier Zhaobao Qilang as that god's followers came to worship Mazu. Qianliyan also occasionally appears with three heads and six arms. He usually appears to the right of his companion Shunfeng'er. He sometimes appears as the red demon, in which case he usually has two horns and yellow sapphire eyes.

In order to address their concerns, the JMLA declared a strike against the WACC during a pivotal moment in the sugar beet season. Several of WACC's contracted workers joined the JMLA, which caused a standstill in the sugar industry.

The CUOM served as an umbrella group for the agricultural unions in Southern California, which were made up of Mexican Americans. In 1928 the organization had over 3,000 members and represented 8 different unions.

Location The Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park has an area of , and is about in a 60¬∞NE direction from the port of Mucuripe, in Fortaleza. It is contained in a rectangle between 3¬∫33.8\\"S and 3¬∫36\\"S, and between 38¬∫21.6\\"W and 38¬∫26\\"W. It can be reached by boat from Mucuripe in a boat ride of about 50 minute. Visitors may practice scuba diving and sport fishing. History Before the park was created uncontrolled and predatory fishing had caused declining numbers of fish and lobsters, in conflict with the tourist image of Cear√° as a place of pristine beaches and reefs. Creation of the park was therefore proposed by several governmental and non- governmental organizations. The Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park was created by state law 12717 of 5 September 1997 to protect an area of reefs, the only marine conservation unit in the state of Cear√°. It aims to protect breeding and feeding area for marine species, to rescue artisan fishing, to support research and to promote underwater tourism. Environment The substrate consists of sand and gravel with a large aggregation of calcareous and rocky outcrops, typical of the Cear√° coastal zone. Depths are and includes the wreckage of a Bandeirante airplane, considered underwater archaeological heritage and an artificial reef. The rock formations are roughly linear, from high and are known as riscas (stripes) by the local fishermen, from which the park is named. Visibility is usually from . There is no land above water. The park protects a valuable biological refuge with a fragile ecology that supports a diverse population of marine species. The waters are warm, with temperatures varying from . The rocky outcrops support a rich benthic biota, providing food and shelter to many marine species. 116 species of fish have been identified, including 6 elasmobranchii, as well as the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and three species of sea turtles. Invertebrates are less well studied, but an initial survey of sponges in 2006 found the endemic species Sigmaxinella cearense, in a genus known only from the Pacific. Human impact Artisanal and sport fishing (line and hook) is allowed, as is collection for scientific research purposes and diving with prior authorization. Trawling with nets is banned, as is spear fishing, capture of ornamental fish and disposal of waste. The main threats are from predatory fishing with nets and collection of ornamental fish. The local artisan fishers complain that clandestine boats come for this purposes, mainly from other states.

He has been described as \\"the most illustrious Chinese arithmetician.\\" Almost all that is known about his life is contained in a passage written in the Preface of the book by one of his descendants when the book was being reprinted: :In his youth my ancestor Cheng Da Wei was academically gifted, but although he was well versed in scholarly matters, he continued to carry out his profession as a sincere Local Agent, without becoming a scholar. He never lagged behind either on the classics or on ancient writings with old style characters, but was particularly gifted in arithmetic. In the prime of his life he visited the fairs of Wu and Chu. When he came across books that talked about \\"square fields\\" or \\"grain with the husk removed\\" ... he never looked at the price before purchasing them. He questioned respectable old men who were experienced in the practice of arithmetic and gradually and indefatigably formed his own collection of difficult problems. Cheng Dawei was not a professional mathematician. From the description cited above, one could deduce that he must have traveled widely. Also must have been well off since he purchased books without asking the price. Again we can see that he was an avid collector of books on mathematics. This is borne out by the contents of his work General Source of Computational Methods which is essentially a compilation of problems from earlier works. General Source of Computational Methods The General Source of Computational Methods was first published in 1592. It is essentially a general arithmetic for the abacus. Though there is nothing particularly original about this book, it was republished several times and became widely popular. Beyond the limited circle of mathematicians, it must have reached a vast popular audience. Its popularity must have continued to modern times as can be seen from a remark by a contemporary historian of Chinese mathematics: \\"Nowadays, various editions of the book can still be found in China and old people still recite the versified formulas and talk about the difficult problems in it.\\" The book contains 595 problems divided into 12 chapters. According to Jean Claude Martzloff, historian of Chinese mathematics, \\"... unlike the authors of the venerable classic, Cheng Dawei was not afraid of superfluity or verbosity. His book is an encyclopaedic hotch-potch of ideas which contains everything from A to Z relating to the Chinese mystique of numbers (magic squares, ... generation of the eight trigrams, musical tubes), how computation should be taught and studied, the meaning of technical arithmetical terms, computation on the abacus with its tables which must be learnt by heart, the history of Chinese mathematics, mathematical recreations and mathematical curiosities of all types.\\" The book provided a poem to solve a remainder problem. (Divide it by 3 and multiply the remainder by 70.) (Divide it by 5 and multiply the remainder by 21.) (Divide it by 7 and multiply the remainder by 15.) (Adjust the sum by subtracting or adding multiple of 105, LCM of 3, 5 and 7.) Cheng Dawei Abacus Museum In the Huangshan City in southern Anhui province in, there is a museum for abacuses named after Cheng Dawei. There are more than 1,000 abacuses and 3,000 copies of related materials displayed in the showcases. These abacuses are made of gold, silver, ivory, jade, stone, hard wood respectively with different shapes.

Early life  Javier T√©llez was born in 1969 in Valencia, Venezuela. Both his mother and father were psychiatrists, thus exposing T√©llez to ideas and concepts about mental illness from a young age. His father worked at B√°rbula Psychiatric Hospital in Venezuela and would sometimes treat patients with his son in the same room. T√©llez has spoken about attending carnivals at the hospital‚Äîknown for its progressive, alternative treatment methods‚Äîwhere patients and psychiatrists would switch uniforms to symbolically invert their stereotypical, daily roles. This later became influential in his work and inspired his interest in masks and the carnivalesque. In 1911, his grandfather founded one of the first movie theaters in Venezuela. As a child T√©llez would spend time in the projection booth, sparking his interest in film from a young age. T√©llez has commented on his memories of visiting art museums as a child and drawing connections between museums and psychiatric hospitals saying ‚Äúboth institutions are symbolic representations of authority, founded on taxonomies based on the normal and the pathological, inclusion and exclusion.‚Äù He attended the Arturo Michelena School of Fine Arts in Venezuela. He was a participant in the P.S. 1 International Studio Program in 1993, the Whitney Independent Study Program in 1997, the Gasworks Studio Program, London in 1999, and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1999. T√©llez has been openly critical of the corruption and class conflicts in his native Venezuela, opting to turn down his invitation to represent Venezuela at the 50th Venice Biennial.  Techniques and processes  Javier T√©llez is widely known for his films which feature patients from psychiatric institutions, thus allowing traditionally marginalized groups of people the power to narrate their own stories. While his interest in film was in part inspired by his grandfather, T√©llez sees film as a medium with which one can expose reality and therefore easily lends itself to the ideas and intention of his work. Due to the nature of working with untrained actors, T√©llez notes that his films oftentimes lead to unexpected results and surprises, therefore his films contain elements of both fictional and documentary film styles. By bringing to light how mental illness has been constructed and represented, T√©llez has been able to draw connections between madness and otherness and how these ideals are in direct opposition to Western ideals. T√©llez's work with psychiatric patients grapples with issues of otherness, specifically how poverty, social class, and gender have influenced treatment, popular perception, and representation of mental illness. T√©llez has said, ‚ÄúThe point of my work is not to cure psychiatric patients; perhaps the cure is really for those who go to see the work in the museum.‚Äù Before beginning a new project, T√©llez introduces himself to a new group of patients by screening past works which helps build a sense of continuity among his body of work. Additionally, he will show other films and resources that help contextualize his work and the theme or motifs he hopes to utilize in the particular project or commission. For example, when working on his 2006 Oedipus Marshall, Tellez showed patients classic Western films such as Johnny Guitar, High Noon, and √âdipo Rei. Together, T√©llez and the patients will discuss ideas, develop the plot and script, and make casting decisions. T√©llez sees this collaboration as an integral part of his process, noting the ethical necessity of having these sorts of discussion when working with traditionally marginalized groups of people, but he admits that his collaboration hardly constitutes a collective work environment. Masks serve an important function in T√©llez's films, drawing on ideas about the carnivalesque. The masks serve as a method in which participants can momentarily shed or alter their usual identities, providing the wearer with temporary freedom from social norms. Other common motifs in T√©llez's work include mimicry, chalkboards, and disembodied voices. While T√©llez is known primarily for his use of film, he has also used photography, objects, and sculpture in his installations. For several of his exhibitions, including Bedlam (1999) at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center and Liftoff (2001), T√©llez has constructed large scale birdhouses which entrap the viewer and serve as a subtle reference to Ken Kesey‚Äôs One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest. In a 2004 exhibition at The Bronx Museum of the Arts, T√©llez constructed a large scale, plywood birdhouse with over a hundred white whiffle balls hanging from the ceiling in randomly arranged clusters. The whiffle balls, commonly popular bird toys, are a subtle reference to Kesey‚Äôs work, while also serving to represent stray thoughts confined in a cage-like cranium. Expanding on the idea of entrapment, his 2001 Choreutics installation included a giant spider web in the form of a fish trap, and Calligari and the Somnambulist (2008) was projected in a room constructed of chalkboards. Using sculptural elements allows T√©llez to elaborate on the concept of ‚Äúthe architecture of confinement‚Äù: the idea that patients suffering from mental illness are forced into institutions and exiled from the rest of society, thereby making the institutions themselves a form of architectural straitjacket.  Notable works  * Choreutics (2001): Produced for Plateau of Humankind at the 49th Venice Biennale in 2001, curated by Harald Szeemann. The title is a reference to dance theorist Rudolf Laban‚Äôs ideas on the analysis of movements meant to liberate bodily movements from the traditional confines of classical dance. The film documents villagers afflicted with Huntington's Chorea, a rare, hereditary, neurological disorder which causes outbursts, facial contortions, and involuntary, jerking movements of the body. In rural fishing villages near Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, the number of incidents of the disease are seven hundred times higher than in other parts of the world, but due to the isolation and poverty levels in these villages, the Venezuelan government has undertaken little medical or social assistance for the villagers. The film documents sufferers of the disease struggling to perform even the simplest of tasks such as smiling at the camera or smoking a cigarette. The disease is believed to have been introduced to the area by Spanish sailors, thus T√©llez makes the connection between the otherness and colonial encounters. * La Passion de Jeanne d‚ÄôArc (Rozelle Hospital) (2004): Based on Carl Theodor Dreyer‚Äôs La Passion de Jeanne d‚ÄôArc, T√©llez addresses how gender has historically impacted constructions and diagnoses of mental illness. Inter- titles from Dreyer‚Äôs original film, re-written to tell the story of a new patient at the hospital who suffers from delusions of grandeur believing she is Joan of Arc, are paired underneath individual monologues from female patients at Rozelle Hospital in Sydney. Each narrative begins with a series of frontal, side, and back-head shots of the women, referencing physiognomy and the idea that certain physical traits and facial features were linked to mental illness. T√©llez draws the connection between the martyrdom of Joan of Arc and the process of institutionalization. * One Flew Over the Void (2005): Created for InSite, a public art biennial at the contentious Tijuana-San Diego border, T√©llez staged a live circus act culminating in the expulsion of David ‚ÄòHuman Cannonball‚Äô Smith from a cannon over the border into Playas de Tijuana from Border Field State Park in San Diego, the first ever example of a human being projected over an international border. Patients from CESAM State Psychiatric Hospital in Mexicali began by slowly marching down to a solemn trumpet rendition of the typically upbeat, mariachi ballad of the prodigal son, while holding signs with phrases such as, ‚ÄúLa realidad entre la sanidad mental y la perdida de la razon es muy tenue,‚Äù (There is a very fine line between mental sanity and the loss of reason) which culminates in a disorderly stage performance and the cannonball projection. In the film, T√©llez comments on the tension of the border, most notably the otherization of illegal immigrants and laborers. This work is in the Guggenheim Collection as part of the Guggenheim UBS Map Global Art Initiative. * Oedipus Marshal (2006) was commissioned by the Aspen Art Museum. The cowboy culture nostalgic, Western style remake of Sophocles‚Äô Oedipus Rex was made in collaboration with patients from the Oasis Clubhouse psychiatric facility in Grand Junction, Colorado. The film begins with lingering shots over a ghost town with actors in masks playing Oedipus, Jocasta, Teiresias, and other fortunetellers and ends with the actors shyly smiling as they remove their masks, suggesting the momentary freedom the masks have allowed them. * Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who See (2007): An homage to his mother who lost her vision in the later stages of her life, the film is inspired by the Hindu fable ‚ÄúThe Blind Men and the Elephant.‚Äù The film shows six blind participants touching different parts of an elephant and records their reactions. Just as the actors can never fully experience the animal, the viewer of the film can never fuller experience blindness. * Calligari and the Somnambulist (2008): A re-enactment of Robert Wiene‚Äôs 1920 film Das Kabinet des Dr. Caligari, the first feature film to take on the subject of psychiatric institutions, and includes footage of the patients watching Wiene's original film. T√©llez was inspired by the link between hypnosis and cinema, specifically auditory and visual hallucinations.  Select exhibitions  T√©llez had his first solo show titled I am happy because everyone loves me in 1998 at the Gasworks Gallery in London. T√©llez has since had solo exhibitions at Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil, Mexico City (2004), Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York (2005), Figge von Rosen Galerie, Cologne (2009), Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland (2011), and Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent (2013).

Geopolitical imaginations are reflections of current discourses and therefore they are not fixed but rather vary over time and in different societies. Research has primarily analyzed geopolitical imaginations of European and North American countries, ignoring the fact that in other socio- political contexts there exist different ‚Äònon-western‚Äô geopolitical imaginations. Sharp, Joanne, [\\"‚ÄùA subaltern critical geopolitics of the war on terror: Postcolonial security in Tanzania‚Äù\\"], Geoforum, 2011. 42: 297‚Äì305.  Hegemonic geopolitical imaginations in history  The view of the world as two polarizing ideological blocs (western and eastern bloc) is a geopolitical imagination which was dominant during time of the Cold War. Designations such as the Iron Curtain (the boundary between the bipolar powers) helped to justify certain politics and policies, e.g. in the United States in foreign policy by containment (a military strategy to stop the expansion of the ‚Äòenemy‚Äô) or in domestic policy with the expansion of homeland security which enforced technologies of control and disciplining. Reuber, Paul, [\\"Politische Geographie\\"], Paderborn: Ferdinand Sch√∂ning, 2012. Samuel P. Huntington made a draft of a fragmented conflicted world order. In his popular hypothesis called ‚ÄùThe Clash of Civilizations‚Äù (1996), he divided the world map geographically into rigid cultural entities, such as the Western bloc, the Islamic bloc or the African bloc, and proclaimed that the next major conflict will occur between these different cultures.

Hawley is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews. She is the author of How Things Persist (OUP 2002), Trust: a Very Short Introduction (OUP 2012), and How To Be Trustworthy (OUP 2020). Hawley was elected a Fellow of Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2016, elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2020, and she has been the recipient of a Philip Leverhulme Prize (2003) and a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship (2014‚Äì16).  Life and career  Hawley was born in Stoke-on-Trent, England. She did her undergraduate degree (BA) in physics and philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford (1989‚Äì92) and lived in France for a short while afterwards. She then went on to receive her MPhil(1993‚Äì94) and PhD (1994‚Äì97) in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Peter Lipton. Prior to becoming a Lecturer at the University of St Andrews in 1999, Hawley had been Henry Sidgwick Research Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge, where she had taught a variety of subjects, inter alia, political philosophy, critical thinking, epistemology, formal logic, and metaphysics. She currently lives in Anstruther in Fife. She served as an editorial chair of The Philosophical Quarterly (2005‚Äì10), in addition to being a deputy (1999‚Äì2001) and an associate editor (2011‚Äì2012) of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science.  Work  In How Things Persist (2002), Hawley defends a 'stage- theory' of persistence that combines the four-dimensionalism of perdurance theory with an endurantist account of predication. Heather Dyke (in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews) praised the book for offering a new formulation of endurance theory as ‚Äúthe claim that ordinary objects are such that (i) they exist at more than one time and (ii) statements about what parts they have must be made relative to some time or other‚Äù (Hawley, p. 30, cited in Dyke, 2013). According to Dyke, this characterisation captures the fundamental notion that ordinary objects exist at more than one time without being temporally extended in addition to simplifying cross-comparisons with the perdurance theory, which accepts (i) but rejects (ii). Recently, Hawley's research interests shifted from persistence, parthood and identity to (un)trustworthiness and competence in ethics and epistemology. She cites the metametaphysical turn in analytic philosophy coupled with her deflationary intuitions about the possibility of methodology of metaphysics as a reason for moving away from metaphysics to ethics and epistemology. In How To Be Trustworthy (2020), Hawley explores what it is to be trustworthy or untrustworthy, articulating a notion of 'trustworthiness' as avoiding unfulfilled commitments.

The game was released worldwide on March 29, 2017 and was created by Disney Canada Inc. in order to keep the Club Penguin franchise alive as closing its predecessor, Club Penguin, was necessary. The game's public beta testing period took place in Australia and New Zealand from December 15, 2016 to its worldwide release, and in Canada from January 13, 2017 to its worldwide release. The game was discontinued on December 20, 2018. The gameplay is similar to that of the original Club Penguin, though it runs on the game engine Unity rather than Adobe Flash Player. Club Penguin Island received mixed reviews from critics and many negative reviews from some of the original game's old players upon its worldwide release for lacking many features of the original version at launch. The 1.8 updates, released on November 30, 2017, received positive reviews for adding fan-requested features and launching a PC and Mac version of the game. On September 27, 2018, Disney confirmed the imminent discontinuation of Club Penguin Island in a letter obtained by the website Kotaku, as well as in an official blog post. It was removed from Google Play and the App Store on November 20, 2018. Downloading for Desktop was also removed on December 20, 2018. On November 5, 2018, the final update, version 1.13.0, was released, which included an offline mode, effectively making the game still available as a single-player experience. At 10:00 AM PST on December 20, 2018, Club Penguin Island had shut down their servers. All users that were playing Club Penguin Island at the time received an error message telling them that the connection was lost. Offline Mode was activated on December 21, 2018. Most of Club Penguin Islands URLs redirect to the official Disney website.  History  The game was originally known under the code name of Project: Super Secret, first used in 2014 and teased with sneak peeks in June 2015. However, Project: Super Secret was initially said to be Disney Mix, with the game's actual development confirmed to have started in 2015. On November 17, 2016, the project was revealed to be Club Penguin Island. The official website for the game was released and pre-registration began allowing players to pre-register their account for the game. By pre-registering, players would receive a Beta Hat, a set of six emojis, and 100 coins. Additionally, players had the option of connecting their Club Penguin accounts with their Club Penguin Island account. If this was done, they would also receive the Alumni Jacket, with a number on the back displaying how many years the connected Club Penguin account has existed. The pre-registration was ended on March 29, 2017. The game's closed beta took place between its announcement and December 2016 in North America. A semi-private \\"geo-beta\\" took place in Australia and New Zealand between December 15, 2016 to its worldwide release. This beta was extended to iOS users in Canada on January 13, 2017. The original Flash game's servers went offline on the day of the game's release on March 30, 2017 at 12:01:39 AM PDT (7:01:39 AM UTC). On November 13, 2017, it was announced in a live stream on the official Facebook page of the game that a desktop version of Club Penguin Island would be released the same day the 1.8 update releases at. On November 30, 2017, the desktop version was launched as an open beta, allowing players to report bugs in preparation for a full release at a later date. On September 27, 2018, Disney confirmed in a letter to Disney Canada, obtained by the website Kotaku, that Club Penguin Island would be shutting down and that everyone left would be let go. Disney HR cited \\"global competition\\" as a factor in their decision. On October 12, 2018, the shutdown date was confirmed to be December 20, 2018. Two last parties were also announced, being the Halloween Party 2018 and Waddle On Party. The Mobile App was removed from the Google Play Store and App Store on November 20, 2018, one month prior to the server shutdown. The game was shut down on December 20, 2018 and is no longer available to play online. Offline mode was launched on December 21, allowing the player's account/penguin to be saved after the shutdown.  Plot and gameplay  Club Penguin Island is divided into various zones and distinct areas and contains a variety of features. Each player has a penguin level that is a measurement of their progress. Progress increases as the player completes Adventures and Daily Challenges. Every time a player reaches a new level, they receive a reward in the form of a pack, containing various items, such as emojis or blueprints. All rewards apart from emojis in these packs require membership to use. = Clothing customization = The Clothing Customizer, referred to as The Designer in loading screens, is a feature in Club Penguin Island that players can use to create clothing, utilizing blueprints as bases, and optionally, fabrics and/or decals as well for design. All players can use the Customizer, although only members can wear the resulting clothing. Members have the ability to sell their clothing and buy clothing submitted by other players. Each day, there is a different type of catalog, with a theme. The theme of the catalog determines which blueprints, fabrics, and decals can be used. The theme resets at midnight in Penguin Standard Time. (PST) = Adventures = Adventures, also known as quests, and prefixed with ep. (short for episode) are activities in Club Penguin Island that players may partake in, and are received by talking to specific quest characters. Adventures involve players traveling around the island, completing tasks, and solving problems. Completing adventures yields coins and XP, and often various other rewards as well, such as a unique item or blueprints. Members are able to take part in every adventure. However, non- members are limited to taking part in one adventure from each character. = Daily Challenges = Daily Challenges are activities in Club Penguin Island that players may partake in daily. Each challenge requires players to perform certain actions in order to complete, and each yields a reward in coins and XP, although some community challenges do not yield XP. There are a set of four challenges per day, and these challenges change every midnight in PST but are always in the same set of four. They can be accessed through the Island Live Phone, which displays a tab of the day's challenges. Completing challenges is one of the ways players can gain levels. = Collectibles = Scattered throughout the island are collectible items that can be exchanged for coins at the Beacon Boardwalk. Each collectible has a certain coin exchange rate, location where they are available, amount available per area, and respawn time after collecting. = Igloos = Each player is provided with an igloo for a home which both members and non-members are able to customize. Members have the ability to choose from many variants of igloos as well as purchase items from a full catalog of furniture, landscaping, terrain, interactives, and more. Non-members are able to purchase two types of igloos and non-member items from the catalog. Items can be bought with virtual coins that are earned by playing mini-games, collecting coins throughout the zones, and trading in collectibles at the exchange. Like its predecessor, Club Penguin, anyone can access a players igloo on Club Penguin Island by clicking the igloo icon on their profile, provided the player has selected to make their igloo public. = Gear = Gear is a type of item that members can use to perform various actions. Gear that is obtained through leveling-up or adventures is portable and can be used anywhere on the island. There is also gear that can be found in certain locations and can be used even if the player has yet to obtain it. Non-members can only use the jackhammer gear. = Events = Several events were held on Club Penguin Island. In most cases, one or more free items were made available for everyone to obtain. Some events came with quests that all players were able to participate in. One example of this was the Halloween party. Like its predecessor, the game also hosted some sponsored events. = Party Supplies = Party Supplies are consumable items that can be bought at shops by members, and can be used, each with varying effects. Party Supplies include items such as fireworks, edible items, and party games. = Games = Club Penguin Island contains a variety of games, eight of which are available for all players. Most of these games reward the players with coins and XP upon completion. Both members and non-members are able to purchase and use the party games Marble Hunt, Ink or Swim, and Fossil Four. There are also games that are built-in to the Club Penguin Island zones. Team Dance Battle is a multiplayer memorization game that everyone is able to play with the maximum limit of players in each round being a total of twenty, and at the minimum, one player in each team. Tube racing is a multiplayer racing game that is played by everyone on the top of Mt. Blizzard every couple of minutes. Other games for everyone include the Sea Caves Race Course, the Crate Co. Target Game and Tilt-o-Tube, which involves players trying to knock their opponents off a floating platform. = Island Live = Island Live is a feature added in the 1.8 update of the game. It's the successor of the CPI Phone that was added in the 1.2 update. It can be accessed by clicking on a Phone icon. It shows information about live events taking place on Club Penguin Island, displays Daily Challenges and contains a variety of apps, like a Friends menu, Island News, and Settings. = Membership = Club Penguin Island's revenue was raised predominantly through paid subscriptions, cheaper than its predecessor, of a one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month or twelve-month paid membership, although free access of the game is available. Membership allows players' access to a range of additional features. This includes designing all clothing, wearing all clothing, buying Party Supplies, playing all adventures, completing all Daily Challenges, the ability to use all gear and more. Penguins with a paid membership are called \\"members\\", whereas players who do not have a membership are referred to as \\"non-members\\". Although members gain additional features, players without a membership can obtain all event items whether they're a member or not, obtain wearable event shirts, customize certain items in the Clothing Customizer, play the first adventure of every quest giving character, use Party Supplies given to them by members, customize an igloo (of which anyone is able to visit) with any quantity from a selection of non-member igloo items, play all mini-games, use the jackhammer gear, buy and play party games, join tube races, waddle around anywhere on the island, chat with other players, reach the maximum Penguin Level, and take part in non-member Daily Challenges. After the 1.10.1 update, non-members who signed up during the pre-registration period are now able to wear the beta hat, and if they connected their Club Penguin usernames for use in Club Penguin Island, their alumni jacket too. All players automatically received a free, unlimited membership on November 5, 2018, which would carry over to Offline Mode. Refunds were processed for memberships extending beyond November 6, 2018.

The first Masonic lodge in town, No. 105 A.F. & A.M, was established on the west side of the Cedar River in 1857. Lodge No. 296 was organized on the east side of the river in 1871, and the two consolidated into one lodge eight years later. They built their first Masonic Temple in 1899 at the intersection of Sycamore Street and East Park Avenue. The city was in the midst of a period economic growth that would see its population double each decade from 1890 to 1910. By 1918 the Masons felt the need for a new facility. Property at the intersection of East Park Avenue and Mulberry Street was acquired in 1920. Local architect John G. Ralston, a fellow Mason, was chosen to design the new building in what has been termed the \\"Phoenician Revival\\" style. The exterior walls were completed in 1925, but the interior wasn't completed until 1928. It is a four-story structure built over a raised basement. Its exterior walls are composed of dark red brick accented with light grey limestone. The main fa√ßade features a central entrance pavilion with three entrance ways that terminate in Moorish peaks near the roofline. Various Masonic symbols are found carved into the stone, and decorative brickwork flanks the central stone pavilion. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

All Day Convenience Store was the former Finds Convenience Store Inc., an experimental business of Villar which was established in 2008 with an initial of 40 branches in Metro Manila.  History  2008 when the former senator Manny Villar ventured in the convenience store business and started Finds Convenience Store Inc. as his \\"experimental business\\". Finds grew to 40 branches along Metro Manila and served as a convenience store outlet for his housing business, Camella Homes and at his mall chain, StarMall. Seeing the potential of Finds, Villar took serious and re-branded it as All Day Convenience Store in 2014. In his interview to Entrepreneur Philippines, he said that Finds was one of his small and experimental companies, All Day is the serious attempt. Taking up the challenge against his giant competitors like 7-Eleven and MiniStop, he expanded the branches of All Day to 100 along with the conversion of 40 existing branches of Finds Convenience Store Inc. to All Day Convenience Store. He is optimistic to expand the All Day Convenience Store brand as a \\"True Filipino convenience store\\". At that time, new convenience store brands are coming into the Philippines when Puregold Price Club Inc. has tapped Lawson to open its branches in the Philippines, while SM unveils their venture with Indonesian convenience store, Alfamart and Ayala Land just introduced FamilyMart to the Philippines. The predominant convenience stores in the country, 7-Eleven which is managed by Victor Paterno and Ministop which is managed by John Gokongwei has just sprouted to Mindanao areas. In All Day's recent expansion, it sprouted to more branches in Luzon, concentrating to condominiums, business towers and residential areas. Logo of All Day Supermarket The expansion then grew form being a convenience store to a minimart as \\"All Day Mart\\" with its debut at Starmall Prima Taguig in May 2015. All Day also came to furniture retail business with the introduction of \\"All Home\\". It reached to 13 stores following the opening of All Home in Antipolo last July 2016. It soon grew as a supermarket, branded as All Day Supermart. The supermarket initially opened branches at Starmall Prima Taguig, Starmall EDSA Shaw, and Starmall Santa Rosa, Laguna. In 2016, All Day Supermarket is expanding their branches in Bataan and Las Pinas with a total of 20,000 square meter of floor space. From the experiment on forming Finds Convenience Store Inc., it expanded to a huge \\"All Day\\" mega franchise, forming the parent company, All Value Holdings Inc. However, despite the expansion of All Day brands, All Day Convenience Store reduces their number stores from 100 to 80+ as of 2016, but this is in result to the conversion of some All Day Convenience Store to All Day Mart and All Day Supermarket like their branches in Las Pinas and Starmall Prima Taguig. However, Villiar is still up for expansion ofAll Day Convenience Store with the growth and expansion to his land developments across the country.  Products and Services  Like most convenience stores, All Day Convenience Stores do have its own products and services. Aside from selling snacks, magazines and groceries, All Day Convenience Store offers ATM and Billing Payments and Mobile Reloading.

It was published in 1827 in a collection of fairy tales that take place within the narrative of The Spessart Inn. It formed the basis for the East German film Heart of Stone, released in 1950. Summary Despite taking over his late father's charcoal factory, Peter Marmot, who goes by the name Coal-marmot Peter, is not content with the dirty, exhausting, low-paying and low-status work. He dreams of prosperity and prestige. Then he hears about a forest spirit living in the Black Forest, the little glass-imp, who also goes by the name of Schatzhauser. The glass-imp grants three wishes to every person born on a Sunday between 11 am and 2 pm, just as Peter Marmot was, but he needs to be summoned with a specific poem. During the search for the little glass-imp, Peter comes across another forest spirit, the enormous and dangerous Dutch-Mike, who haunts the forest as an evil sorcerer on stormy nights. Peter, however, is able to escape him. With the poem \\"Schatzhauser in the green firwood, thou art many hundreds of years old. Yours is the land where the firs stand, thou shalt only be seen by Sunday's children (the German version of Monday's Child)‚Äù Peter summons the little glass-imp, who grants him three wishes but with one condition: The third one will not be granted if his first two wishes are foolish. But right off the bat, Peter's first wish is foolish. For Peter wants to be able to dance better than the ‚Äúdance floor king‚Äù and he wants to have just as much money as Ezekiel. Both are questionable role models of Peter's. His second wish is more reasonable. This time he asks for a big glass factory and enough money to run it. The little glass-imp points out that Peter should have wished for the brains necessary for that as well. The little glass-imp refuses to grant the third wish immediately so that Peter has one for later. Peter's two wishes are granted and for a while, luck is on his side. He owns the most beautiful glass factory in the Black Forest, he dances better than everyone else and, when gambling, he has the same amount of money as Ezekiel does. Soon he becomes the most renowned man in the Black Forest. However, his lack of understanding of his chosen craft soon becomes obvious. He neglects his glass factory in favor of going gambling and finds himself in sudden debt. And it is only when he runs into Ezechiel at the tavern that he suddenly has as much money as Ezekiel has in his pockets. Peter's misfortune really starts to unfold when, instead of losing, he suddenly begins to win every single time. Peter wins all of Ezekiel's money until he no longer has any left and, as a result, Peter does not either. Then, he gets chased out of the tavern. The next morning, a district magistrate knocks on his door to seize his glass factory. Out of his mind with misery, Peter goes into the forest to find Dutch-Mike, who, unlike the glass-imp, is in league with the devil. Mike proves to be more generous than the glass-imp, but demands Peter's heart as payment for his help. Peter says his heart and the feelings attached to it only hinder him in life, so he has no problem parting with it. In return for his heart, Peter gets a cold stone in his chest and 100,000 thalers a day and, should that not be enough, Mike adds, Peter is allowed to return to ask for more money whenever he pleases. The next day Peter begins a trip around the world. Soon Peter discovers that he cannot find joy in anything, he can neither laugh nor cry, nor feel any kind of love and he finds nothing is beautiful anymore. His new heart of stone can no longer feel empathy. He returns to the Black Forest and goes to see Dutch-Mike in an attempt to reclaim his heart. Mike turns down Peter's request, telling him that he will only get his heart back after his death. He shows Peter his collection of hearts and Peter realizes that many other great personalities of the Black Forest have traded their hearts for earthly wealth, among them Peter's role model Ezekiel. Mike gives Peter even more money and advises him to find an occupation and to marry to relieve his boredom. Peter builds a mansion in the Black Forest and from then on works as a merchant and debt collector with extortionate rates of interest. He becomes well known for his stinginess and chases away all the poor people who are begging in front of his house. Even his frail mother only receives alms from him and otherwise, he keeps her at arm's length. Next, he goes looking for a wife and asks for the beautiful Lisbeth's hand in marriage. They marry, but Lisbeth soon begins to feel unhappy. Peter is bad tempered, cheap, and forbids Lisbeth from helping the poor, despite their enormous fortune, which is why she is soon seen as even stingier. Lisbeth suffers greatly and wishes that she had never married Peter. When one day a small, old man drops in and asks for something to drink, Lisbeth, thinking nobody is watching her, offers him wine and bread. The man thanks her and says that such a good heart will be rewarded. At this very moment Peter returns. Beside himself with rage, he strikes Lisbeth with the wooden handle of a whip and she dies immediately. When Peter sees his dead wife, he instantly regrets it. The old man reveals himself to be the glass-imp and replies that Peter had trampled the most beautiful flower of the Black Forest. Peter puts the blame on the glass-imp, who turns into a monster out of blind rage. For the sake of Peter's dead wife, who helped him, he gave Peter eight days to think over his own life. Peter sleeps badly and hears voices which tell him to ‚Äúget a warmer heart‚Äù. He lies to the people who miss Lisbeth by telling them his wife suddenly went travelling. The incidents further make him think about his own death. Finally, he goes into the woods and calls for the little glass-imp because he still has one wish left. He wants his heart back, but the ‚ÄúSchatzhauser‚Äù cannot help him, because the deal ‚Äúmoney for a heart‚Äù was not made with him. Instead he tells him how to trick the Dutch- Mike. Peter visits Dutch-Mike for the third time and claims that he has betrayed him because it was not a heart of stone he had implanted in him. Dutch-Mike wants to prove the opposite and ‚Äúas a test‚Äù replaces the stone with Peter's real heart. Then Peter takes out a cross made of glass, which he had received from the little glass-imp, and offers it to Dutch-Mike. This keeps the now furious Dutch-Mike away from him so that the can flee to the little glass-imp's place. Now he regrets how his life turned out, but the little glass-imp reunites him with his mother and Lisbeth, who had come back to life. From now on, on the little glass-imp‚Äôs advice, he becomes a hard-working charcoal burner and even without money enjoys a good reputation. To congratulate him on the birth of his son the little glass-imp gives Peter a present, four rolls of thalers, marking the little glass-imp as the godparent of his son. Romanticism Connections of this tale to the Romantic Era can be drawn. During this literary period it was quite common to write prose in fairy tale form. Drawing on the myth of the \\"glass-imp\\", Hauff presents the Romantic pursuit of happiness. Other Romantic characteristics include the use of the mystical-eerie, the uncanny and folk tales. The key concept of Romanticism is the longing (Sehnsucht) that Coal-marmot Peter embodies, as he is granted three wishes throughout the story. What results from this longing is, as often seen in protagonists of Romantic works, self-destruction, since the riches Peter wished for crumble into misery and his longing degenerates into stinginess and spite. As the hopeless romantic that he is, Coal-marmot Peter does not give up on his quest for happiness and at the end of the fairy tale eventually finds this happiness with his wife. Psychological Analysis In Das kalte Herz: wie ein Mann die Liebe findet; eine tiefenpsychologische Interpretation nach dem M√§rchen von Wilhelm Hauff Mathias Jung performs psychological analysis on the in-plot development of Peter, and its relationship to Hauff's own life : In 1809, when Hauff was only seven years old, his father died, possibly resulting in an intense mother fixation. Struggles of the young Hauff might be mirrored in the character of Peter Marmot, who is morally and mentally unstable and plagued by feelings of inferiority. Peter goes to the \\"wrong father\\", Dutch-Mike, because he has no trust in his industry (see Erikson's stages of psychosocial development ¬ß Competence: Industry vs. Inferiority). The name Peter was chosen because it used to be very common, allowing everyone to identify with him.Mathias Jung: Das kalte Herz: wie ein Mann die Liebe findet; eine tiefenpsychologische Interpretation nach dem M√§rchen von Wilhelm Hauff. 2006, S. 55; 58. The glass- imp apparently represents the conscience or (going with Freud terminology) the super-ego or the positive archetype of the father (as Jung's terminology says). He could also be seen as a moral compass, a daimonion (using Socrates' term). This also stands for \\"civil trade and morality\\" whereas Dutch-Mike depicts the unbridled \\"profit seeking of the commercial in this first third of the nineteenth century.\\" The name Ezekiel goes back to the biblical prophet Ezekiel, who said \\"I will take the stony hearts out of your body and I will give you one of flesh.\\"Mathias Jung: Das kalte Herz: wie ein Mann die Liebe findet; eine tiefenpsychologische Interpretation nach dem M√§rchen von Wilhelm Hauff. 2006, S. 62, 63, 77, 122 According to Jung, Peter Munk remains in a state of self-abuse, in which he plays, dances, drinks and quests after wealth and acknowledgement from others. Peter is middle-aged and he follows the model of Erik Erikson (identity and lifestyle) at the stage of \\"generativity vs. stagnation.\\" One of the central tasks of this lifestyle is the passing on of this life to the next generation, building a house and trying to improve public-mindedness. In the beginning, Peter fails at these tasks.Mathias Jung: Das kalte Herz: wie ein Mann die Liebe findet; eine tiefenpsychologische Interpretation nach dem M√§rchen von Wilhelm Hauff. 2006, S. 145, 151, 152, 159-161, 168 Films *Heart of Stone (1924) *Heart of Stone (1950) See also * German folklore  References  German folklore German fairy tales Culture of Baden-W√ºrttemberg 1827 short stories ","title":"Heart of Stone (German fairy tale)"},{"id":"52411381","text":"Daryle Lamont Jenkins (born July 22, 1968) is an American political activist, best known for founding One People's Project, an organization based in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

By using social media, adolescents can develop issues associated with mental health, but positive effects are also present. Research =Positive impacts= Social media may positively affect adolescents by promoting a feeling of inclusion, providing greater access to more friends, and enhancing romantic relationships. Social Media is proven to allow people to communicate with people, no matter how far away they are from each other. Some adolescents with social and emotional issues feel more included with social media and online activities. As social media usage has risen, the typical adolescent in the United States has become less socially isolated and more likely to linger in public spaces, because social media have changed the ways that they are able to interact in public spaces. Social media can give people a sense of belonging which can lead to an increase in identity development. Adolescents that post pictures on social media can look back on his memorable moments and this positive emotion can be related to a sense of their true identity. Additionally, social media provide a way to communicate with friends and family when alone. Adolescents who use social media tend to be more outgoing and interact more with others online and in person. According to Newport Academy, teens who spend more time on non- screen activities, such as sports, exercise, in-person social interaction, or any other in-person activities are less likely to report any mental issue, sucah as anxiety or depression. Vivek, Hans. (2019) The Effect of Social Media on Teenagers. Social media provide adolescents within the United States the ability to connect with people from other countries. Being involved in social media typically improves communication skills, social connections, and technical skills. Furthermore, adolescents who are students can use social media to seek academic help. The appropriate usage of social media has developed favourable academic environments for both, the students and the teaching faculty, offering them potential benefits in the process of learning information. Social Media also allows for the expression of creativity and can display people's interests and talents digitally. For example, high schoolers can feel more connected with their community by seeing what everyone is being involved in. When adolescents use the app Instagram, what they are reading and who they follow is based on their interests. When engaging in this, they are exploring and learning new things regarding their interests. According to the Mayo Clinic, these platforms can expose teens to current events and teach them many things, such as developing healthy habits. Mayo Clinic Staff. (2019) Teens and Social Media Use: Whats The Impact?. Some social media platforms are also used for entertainment. For example, the app Vine consists of videos that are intended to create a positive response from the audience. =Negative impacts= Social comparison theory examines how people establish their personal value by comparing themselves to others.Social Comparison Theory. (n.d.). Retrieved October 26, 2017, from https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/social-comparison-theory These social comparisons and related feelings of jealousy, when made on social media platforms, can lead to the development of symptoms of depression in users.Walton, A. G. (2017, June 30). 6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health. Retrieved September 23, 2017, from Forbes website: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/06/30/a-run-down-of-social- medias-effects-on-our-mental-health/#75da74542e5a Depression is common also for children and adolescents who have been cyberbullied. According to Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance ‚Äî United States, 2015, nationwide, 15.5% of students had been electronically bullied, counting being bullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting, during the 12 months before the survey . Using 7 or more social media platforms has been correlated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression in adolescents. While making friends is possible on social media, adolescents using social media may experience loneliness and question others' genuineness. The parents of adolescents may not understand social media fully and are concerned about safety and the effect of social media on social development. The increased role of social media and technology in adolescents' daily communications may affect their development of in-person relationships. Increased social media usage may impact how adolescents socialize face-to-face, leading to social isolation when faced with self-doubt or a lack of confidence. Social media can significantly influence body image concerns in female adolescents. Young women who are easily influenced by the images of others on social media may hold themselves to an unrealistic standard for their bodies because of the prevalence of digital image alteration. Engaging with social media platforms two hours before falling asleep can seriously effect sleep quality, and a longer duration of digital media use is associated with reduced total sleep time. The phenomena of \\"Facebook depression\\" is a condition which comes to surface when young adults have a higher usage of Facebook and tend to manifest the actual symptoms of depression. Youths who frequently use social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent, while those who dedicate themselves to outdoor activities don‚Äôt have that much risk.‚ÄúNational Survey on Drug Use and Health 2015 (NSDUH-2015-DS0001).‚Äù Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D)  SAMHDA, www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national- survey-drug-use-and-health-2015-nsduh-2015-ds0001-nid16894. Health Social media has effects on the physical health of teens impacting their development with both short- and long-term consequences. Sleep deprivation may also be another common factor in teens. According to the Mayo Clinic, a 2016 study that was conducted to more than 450 teens found that greater social media use, nighttime social media use and emotional investment in social media, such as feeling upset when prevented from logging on, were each linked with worse sleep quality that could increase the levels of anxiety and depression. Mayo Clinic Staff. (2019). Teens and Social Media Use: What's The Impact? With the amount of access teens have to social media the, ‚Äúharmful consequences include health problems emotional problems, including suicide, internet addiction, including video game addiction; risky Internet use; and social/functional impairment. (Guinta & John, 2018, p.1).‚Äù Each of the following issues can lead to secondary complications from their academic performances to health behaviors that are impacted upon their lives indirectly. In addition, it increases their risk or worsens their current health conditions with a lack of care or time for their health condition. Research has shown how YouTube has been a good learning tool for many students and how it has proven to be a medium where students are able to learn any type of subject they want and many people have been self taught through this medium; however not everything that is on YouTube is to help us improve our academic performance. Social media such as YouTube has also proven to distract people from doing their homework and studies show how many students in college procrastinate for many hours by watching YouTube or scrolling through other social media.Social media can be a distraction, with 99% of adolescents using social media for an average of nine out of the 24 hour day. Social Media has shown that it creates an environment where everyone feels as if they have to look and act a certain way. Adolescents are feeling ‚Äújudged‚Äù when they post on Instagram and worry constantly if their post will reach a certain number of likes and if the social community will accept them. Teens often will even look for a friends acceptance of a picture they want to post. If they receive negative feedback, this allows for a decrease in their self-esteem. For example, Facebook is correlated with girls feeling dissatisfied with their weight. Other concerns with social media on adolescents is anxiety and stress. This can be from jealousy and also the fear of missing out or not looking like everyone else. From the month of January to March of 2016 , a survey displaying 44 questions was given to patients at the Adolescent Medicine and General Academics Pediatric outpatient offices in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This survey's participants ranged from 11 to 22. The results of this survey concluded that if a person receives a higher PHQ-9 score, reported that they have increased feelings of depression and anxiety after social media use.Higher scores also showed there was greater occurrence of jealousy and the participants comparing their life to others on social media. When it comes to communication, adolescents can feel overwhelmed at times by how many messages they are receiving and the negative stigma that is behind not answering.

Culinary career Yamamoto's food has been described as a combination of the Japanese Kaiseki with elements of molecular gastronomy, although he does not use those descriptors himself. His first experience of cooking was at 11 years old, when he made a dish of vegetables and rice at school. This impressed his mother, and he then would cook with her frequently. Yamamoto sometimes resented this as a child because it meant he did not have time to play, but felt it was worth while when he saw how happy his mother was when he made her dinner. Following culinary school, he spent the following 11 years working under Hirohisa Koyama at his restaurant Aoyagi. He was invited to give a presentation at the Madrid Fusi√≥n international culinary show where he screen printed squid ink to resemble a newspaper. At another presentation, he prevented rigor mortis from setting into a fish using a wire. This has impressed several of his fellow chefs, with Ferran Adri√†, formerly of elBulli, describing him as \\"one of the most important chefs in Japan.\\" At his restaurants, he takes on staff from a variety of cultural backgrounds to allow the things they learn there to be spread to other countries - with this he hopes that Japanese cuisine can continue to evolve. Yamamoto feels that unlike Chinese cuisine, the elements of Japanese food are not well described in other cultures it should be combined with the places it travels to. He compared replicating Japanese food exactly in Hong Kong to producing counterfeit money. His signature dish is a hamo eel soup. Rather than adopt the traditional knife techniques of his fellow Japanese chefs to remove the bones from the fish, he instead had one undergo a CT scan to exactly map out the bone structure to allow him to carve it with ease. This dish is routinely on the tasting menus at his restaurants. This was originally to prepare for a cooking demonstration in 2005. =Nihonryori RyuGin= He opened his Tokyo based restaurant, Nihonryori RyuGin, in 2003.

Later, in 1953, she became the first woman to serve in the German consular service in Houston.Helmut Stubbe da Luz: Margareta Gr√∂wel. In: G√ºnther Buchstab u.a. (Hrsg.): Christliche Demokraten gegen Hitler: Aus Verfolgung und Widerstand zur Union. Herder, Freiburg 2004, , p. 227. Life =Early years= Margarete Gr√∂wel was born in Hamburg. She qualified as a teacher and taught at a Catholic school for boys in the city's St. Georg quarter. After the Catholic schools in Hamburg were closed down, in 1934, she enrolled as a student at University of Hamburg where she studied Philology, History, Ethnology and Philosophy. She progressed with her studies and in 1937 received a doctorate, for which she was supervised by the ethnographer-anthropologist Georg Thilenius. Her dissertation concerned the education problems of \\"Indian\\" (Native American) children in the United States. After passing the necessary further exams she worked in a teacher training college and at a secondary school in Hamburg. =Public service= As a young woman during the Weimar years Gr√∂wel was engaged in charitable and women's social welfare associations. She was also politically engaged, joining the catholic Centre Party in 1921 or 1924. An influential political mentor was . During the years before 1933 she was active in Hamburg within the Association for German cultural relations abroad (\\"Verein f√ºr Deutsche Kulturbeziehungen im Ausland\\" / VDA), the Windhorst League (\\"Windthorstbund\\") and the Catholic German Teachers' League (\\"Verein der katholischen deutschen Lehrerinnen\\" / VKDL). In 1939 she switched from the VKDL to the National Socialist Teachers League (\\"Nationalsozialistische Lehrerbund\\" / NSLB). (Although membership of the NSLB was not compulsory, it had by this time become in practical terms the only permitted association representing teachers.) Active participation in quasi-political associations during the Weimar years evidently placed Margarete Gr√∂wel on a list of potential government targets. The failed assassination attempt against Hitler was followed by a mass-roundup of people identified as anti-Nazis. The overwhelming majority of those arrested in what came to be known as \\"Aktion Gitter\\" had been active as members or supporters of the Communist or Social Democratic Party during the Weimar years. A handful had not. There is no indication in the sources that Gr√∂wel was ever a Communist or a Socialist (or a Nazi), but during August 1944 she was one of approximately five thousand people arrested. She was taken to the concentration camp at Fuhlsb√ºttel on the north side of the city centre. However, she was released on 29 August 1944.Helmut Stubbe da Luz: Union der Christen ‚Äì Splittergruppe ‚Äì Integrationspartei. Wurzeln und Anf√§nge der Hamburger CDU bis Ende 1946. Dissertation, Universit√§t Hamburg, 1990. =Postwar politics= War ended in May 1945, leaving Hamburg in the British occupation zone (after May 1949 part of the Federal Republic of (West) Germany). There was a widespread view that it was the failure of the traditional political parties to present a united front that had enabled populist politicians to take power in 1933, and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was created in 1945 to embrace the entire palette of centrist and moderate right-wing political traditions. In Hamburg Margarete Gr√∂wel was a co-founder. She became a deputy president (and chair of the Women's Committee) in the new party in the British zone. At the party's first national conference, held in Goslar in 1950, she was elected a member of the party's national executive. Locally, during the early postwar years she took a job at the library attached to the Hamburg Museum of Ethnology, where her former tutor Georg Thilenius had been the director for three decades till 1935. She was politically active locally as a member of the city council, and as president of the city's cultural commission closely involved in negotiations over cultural matters with and Gerd Bucerius.Christof Brauers: Die FDP in Hamburg 1945 bis 1953. M-Press Meidenbauer, M√ºnchen 2007, , p. 271. =Beyond politics= In 1953 she married the Austrian engineer Maximilian Sztollar, after which her name became Margareta Sztollar-Gr√∂wel. This coincided with the conclusion of her direct political involvement, and she joined the West German consular office in Houston, Texas, the first woman ever to do so. She worked to develop commercial relations between West Germany and the American south. After her return from Houston she took on the same function closer to home, at Liege in Belgium, where she was posted between 1962 and 1964.

Kilfinan is the burial place of the clan chiefs of the Lamonts, in the 13th-century Kilfinan Parish Church. The parish covers the entire western part of Cowal. Church of Saint Finan The parish church of Saint Finan dates from the 13th century: the church was first recorded between 1231 and 1241 in a series of grants and confirmations by Duncan, second son of Ferchar, and his nephew young Laumon. Laumon was an ancestor of the Lamont family, who gave the church and all its rights, to the Cluniac Monks of Paisley Abbey, Paisley. =Interior= In 1633 the Lamont North Aisle was added. It was the work of Sir Coll Lamont, whose initials \\"S/CL\\" are carved in the east and west cavetto skewputts of the crowstepped north gable. The date 1633 also appears. Within a cusped frame on the lintel of the west doorway, the same date and initials are carved in relief, together with \\"D/BS\\" for Lamont's wife Dame Barbara Semple. There is late medieval work incorporated into the vault itself. In 2015 and 2016, while restoration work was undertaken, the Ancient Stones were removed from the Lamont Vault. The earth floor was lowered and more medieval bones were revealed; at this time two 17th-century lead coffins were also discovered. It has been suggested that the coffins contain the remains of Sir Coll Lamont 1634 and his wife Dame Barbara Semple, whose initials appear on a lintel above the vault entrance. The Upper Lamont Aisle is now a modern Gallery. The Lamont Vault and Gallery today contain one of the best collections of ancient burial stones in the West of Scotland.

Isserman (May 11, 1900 - April 22, 1988) was an American lawyer and activist who defended Gerhart Eisler in 1947 and CPUSA leaders in the Foley Square trial (1949): he was found in contempt of court by Judge Harold Medina, sentenced to four months in jail (1952), and disbarred. Background Isserman was born on May 11, 1900, in Belgium.  Career  Abraham J. Isserman and Morris Isserman were private attorneys at Isserman & Isserman, 24 Commerce Street, Newark, New Jersey. His clients included Edith Berkman, the New Jersey chapter of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the union called the American Newspaper Guild. In the 1930s through 1941, he served as counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. =\\"Communist lawyer\\"= Isserman defended CPUSA members during the McCarthy Era. Isserman was a member of the Communist Party and identified by the Federal government as one of several \\"communist lawyers.\\" In 1939, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) reported that Isserman was a member of the national committee of the International Juridical Association, a communist-leaning group co- founded by Carol Weiss King and Shad Polier among others. In 1939, ACLU chief Roger Nash Baldwin asked Isserman to prepare a legal brief on whether witnesses could invoke the Fifth Amendment to help witnesses called before the Dies Committee (predecessor to HUAC). In April 1943, Walter Gellhorn, then New York Regional Attorney and Assistant General Counsel (later professor of law at Columbia University, also brother of photographer Martha Gellhorn) testified before HUAC as follows: > Mr. MATTHEWS: Do you know Abraham J. Isserman? > Mr. GELLHORN: Yes. > Mr. MATTHEWS: Do you have any personal views on whether Mr. Isserman is a > Communist or a communist sympathizer? > Mr. GELLHORN: I imagine the latter. I have no information on the former. I > know him to be a competent attorney. I have consulted with him on one or two > labor matters. = Gerhart Eisler trial = In 1947, with Carol Weiss King, Isserman defended Gerhart Eisler in a trial for fraudulent passport. (The Federal government believed that the full \\"Eisler defense committee included: Max Bedacht, Dr. Felix Boenheim, Charles Collins, Eugene P. Connolly, Gustav Faber, Ida Guggenheimer, Isserman, King, Albert Maltz, and Walter Mueller. ) In the press, Eisler had been accused of being a mastermind for Soviet spies in the United States. On February 17, 1947, Life (magazine) magazine ran \\"The Career of Gerhart Eisler as a Comintern Agent\\" whose subtext read \\"Prototyp of a professional, Moscow-schooled revolutionary, he is now charged with conspiracy against the government of the U.S.\\" During proceedings, Isserman stated, \\"I charge that this whole procedure is in bad faither and savors to me of something more.\\" Eisler skipped bail and left the country by means of a Polish freighter. In 1949, the court removed Eisler v. United States, 338 U.S. 189, from the docket, pending return of the fugitive Eisler. = Foley Square trial = Robert Thompson and Benjamin J. Davis during Foley Square trial, which Isserman helped defend In 1949, Isserman served as one of five attorneys led by Harry Sacher as lead counsel to represent 11 members of the CPUSA's national board, accused of conspiring to teach and advocate the violent overthrow of the Government. The other three attorneys were Richard Gladstein, Louis F. McCabe, and George W. Crockett, Jr. (Sometimes, Isserman is cited as chief counsel. ) Isserman was representing Gil Green and John Williamson. During appeal of the conviction, Isserman and colleagues accused trial judge Harold R. Medina of improperly favoring the prosecution. The defendants lost their appeal and went to prison. Contempt, Disbarment Further, Isserman and Crockett among other defense attorneys was found in contempt of court. In 1952, Isserman went to jail for four months, despite support from groups like the National Lawyers Guild. In 1954, he was disbarred from law practice in the State of New Jersey. Following a 1953 order, he was also disbarred from the U.S. Supreme Court (In re Isserman, 348 U.S. 1 1954). Restoration In 1961, New Jersey's Supreme Court voided the disbarment and had his license restored. Personal and death On April 22, 1988, Isserman died in a nursing home in New York City after several strokes. Maurice Isserman is his nephew.

He was appointed to the position on September 1, 2015. Prior to coming to Burlington, del Pozo served with the New York City Police Department for nearly two decades, rising to the rank of deputy inspector. While there, he commanded the 6th and 50th Precincts, and served overseas as an intelligence officer for the Arab world and India (based in Jordan's capital, Amman), where he investigated terror attacks to see what lessons they offered for better protecting New York City. He has received national recognition for his commitment to innovation and reform.  Education Born in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of the New York borough of Brooklyn to a Cuban father and Jewish mother, del Pozo graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York, then completed a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College. Del Pozo earned a master's degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a master of arts in Criminal Justice from John Jay College. While at the Kennedy School, he was a 9/11 Public Service Fellow, in recognition of the sacrifices made by first responders on that day. He holds a PhD in Philosophy and the enroute MPhil degree from The Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York. His dissertation, The Police and the State, \\"offers a systematic account of the relationship between the police and the democratic state\\" in terms of contemporary political philosophy.  Career Citing the challenges of policing in the United States, del Pozo came to Burlington with a desire to improve police services in the city as a model for progress in the profession. His appointment was contested by some locals due to his prior work with the New York Police Department (NYPD). After a public discussion of his views, his nomination was unanimously approved by the Burlington City Council. = Opioid addiction and overdose reduction= Opioid abuse and dependency have been a concern for the city and its police in light of the state of Vermont's wider struggles with opioid addiction. Burlington mayor Miro Weinberger directed del Pozo to create and implement a strategy for addressing its effects that focuses on public health rather than law enforcement and uses data and collaboration as cornerstones of the approach. Shortly after taking on the leadership of the Burlington Police Department, del Pozo began a wide-ranging initiative. He directed all patrol officers to carry Naloxone, the overdose reversal drug, and assisted the mayor's office with the creation of the city's Opioid Policy Coordinator position, as well as staffing his office with analyst with graduate training in epidemiology and biostatistics. Based out of the police department, the two positions vet police work for better public health outcomes and assist the city in formulating policies, directives and public engagements to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid abuse. Del Pozo has been known to personally meet with and try to help members of the community suffering from addiction, and his insights into the need for swift action and an end to stigma in treating addiction and overdose have gone viral and gained national attention. He has been vocal about the need for all people suffering from opioid addiction to have prompt access to the medications proven to treat it, including prisoners, and he adopted a policy in conjunction with the county prosecutor where his department would not arrest people for unprescribed possession of buprenorphine. In early 2020, the city of Philadelphia took the same position towards buprenorphine, citing Burlington's leadership on the issue. In 2018, as the rest of Vermont saw a 20% increase in opioid overdose deaths, Burlington's county saw a 50% decline in these deaths, to their lowest levels since 2013, when the state began keeping records. The reduction was sustained through the end of 2019. Del Pozo serves on the board of trustees of the Howard Center, Vermont's largest addiction and mental health service provider. = Use of force reform= In the winter of 2016, after a Burlington police officer killed Phil Grenon, a man who attacked the police with knives at the end of a prolonged standoff, del Pozo began a program to improve outcomes in the use of force, piloting the Police Executive Research Forum's (PERF) new force guidelines and curriculum and introducing new tactics and technologies that avert physical confrontations. The Reveal, a show syndicated by American Public Media, produced a segment taking a close look at the incident and its aftermath: \\"When Tasers Fail.\\" In 2018, del Pozo gave the highest award in the department to an officer who was in the path of a robbery suspect fleeing in a vehicle and would have been justified in opening fire on the vehicle, but chose not to, saying that restraint was a valuable quality in a police officer. He also investigated the Vermont State Police Academy for allegations that officers were needlessly being struck unexpectedly in the head during training scenarios, causing a pattern of concussions. As a result, the academy settled a suit with one of the injured students and ceased delivering unexpected blows to the heads of its recruits. In November 2019, del Pozo authored an op-ed in The New York Times arguing that when confronting persons in crisis armed with knives, police officers should view their firearms as a means to defend themselves and others from harm, rather than the means by which to persuade the person to drop the knife, often accompanied by yelling orders that only escalate the person in crisis. Instead, he advocated that officers should have a gun at the ready, but engage with distressed suspects as if the officer was unarmed and had to rely on deescalation and persuasion instead. A few weeks later, his view was echoed by the Washington Post editorial board, which observed that the present protocol \\"is for officers to advance and draw their guns, repeatedly shout 'Drop the knife!' and hope for compliance. But pointing a gun at a person in crisis tends to increase their anxiety and exacerbate the situation, while advancing toward them may put the officer in unnecessary danger.\\" The Post repeated del Pozo's observation that, in sum, \\"officers should be trained not to point weapons at potentially suicidal people, to move a safe distance away and continue backing away when possible, and to converse with the person rather than shouting commands.\\" Both opinion pieces were based on a research report by PERF outlining the potential for such innovations in police tactics to prevent shootings and save lives. = Transparency= An advocate for greater transparency in policing and government, del Pozo created a police data transparency portal where he discloses a range of raw and processed data about the work of the Burlington Police under a quote by legal philosopher Jeremy Waldron: \\"In a democracy, the accountable agents of the people owe the people an account of what they have been doing, and a refusal to provide this is simple insolence.\\" He has spoken at the Obama White House to an audience of police leaders on the value of the practice as part of efforts to implement the recommendations of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. During his tenure, the police department has made concerted efforts to diversify its rank and file, with moderate success. = Overseas intelligence= In 2005, citing intelligence failures that led to the 9/11 terror attacks, the NYPD selected del Pozo to create and staff its first intelligence liaison post with the Arab world, based out of Amman, Jordan. Embedded with the Jordanian National Police, he responded to suicide bombings at Jordanian hotels planned and executed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and an attack on a Roman amphitheater. He also responded to two attacks in Mumbai, India: a 2006 bombing of seven trains on the city's commuter rail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/Mumbai-terror-makes-NYPD- Blue/articleshow/1785453.cms and the 2008 Lashkar-e-Taiba-led attack on downtown Mumbai itself, where a team of gunmen attacked hotels, transportation hubs, tourist areas and a Jewish cultural center. Del Pozo reported his analyses back to the NYPD and other agencies, assessing how these attacks could be replicated by exploiting security vulnerabilities in New York City, and what measures could be taken to prevent them. His role was unique in that there was no other US intelligence officer conducting work on behalf of a municipal police department in either region. = Recognition= In May 2016, the PERF awarded del Pozo its Gary Hayes Memorial Award for his innovation and leadership. He is also an executive fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Police Foundation, a \\"national, independent non-profit organization dedicated to advancing policing through innovation and science.\\" New York Times editor and book critic Dwight Garner characterized del Pozo as \\"thoughtful and sane.\\" He is presently writing a book about police work for Farrar, Straus & Giroux. = Resignation= Del Pozo resigned as police chief on December 16, 2019, after disclosing that he had used an anonymous Twitter account to direct approximately eight tweets at a critic of the city leadership, for approximately an hour on July 4, before deleting the tweets and the account within the hour. When asked by a reporter about the tweets later that July, del Pozo denied authorship. Five months later, when Del Pozo admitted that he authored the tweets, he resigned. In a statement to The New York Times, he said he wrote eight Tweets \\"in 45 minutes of my life that I wish I could take back, but they taught me that nothing good ever comes from letting social media criticism get under your skin... It was a real lesson learned during a stressful time in my life.\\" An attorney suing the city complained that del Pozo didn't list the Twitter account in court filings pertaining to an unrelated use of force lawsuit. The federal court judge reviewing the complaint dismissed it, ruling that the attorney violated good faith by making the complaint,https://vtdigger.org/2020/01/24/federal-judge-denies-motion-to- sanction-burlington-over-ex-chiefs-twitter-account/ and finding \\"no evidence that the omissions had caused any 'discernable [sic] harm.'\\"  Research Shortly after completing his doctorate, del Pozo's dissertation research was featured on Slate and in a podcast by Hi-Phi nation, and showcased by the CUNY Graduate Center as an example of doctoral research with the potential for significant public impact. He then accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher in drug policy and substance use at the Miriam Hospital and the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.  Personal life Del Pozo married Sarah Carnevale in 2002. They moved to Burlington from the village of Cold Spring, New York. He wrote and directed a narrative short film, Sunday 1287, which screened at the Middlebury and Vermont International Film Festivals. The film was based on a crime he investigated while commanding a precinct in the New York borough of the Bronx. In 2018, he suffered multiple serious injuries in a bicycle accident, was evacuated to an intensive care unit by helicopter, and went on to recover and return to full duty in his role. An outdoors enthusiast, he has climbed New Hampshire's 48 highest mountains, completed the Lake Placid Half Ironman and other triathlons, and written for publications about cycling and climbing.

At the same time, he studied with the sculptor, Julius Middelthun, at the Royal Drawing School. Jotunheimen, Melkedalen (Milk Valley, 1908) One day, while working alone at Eckersberg's art school, he received a surprise visit from King Charles IV, who was quite knowledgeable about art. He gave the King a tour, which ended with the purchase of a painting he had just completed and the promise of a 100 Daler annual scholarship.Brief biography @ Terra Buskerud-Historiebok. He used this money to attend the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, where he studied under Hans Fredrik Gude from 1871 to 1876; serving as his assistant during the last three years.Brief biography @ the Norsk Kunstlerleksikon. After that, he returned to Norway and remained there until his death, although he often spent his summers working in Switzerland. At one point, he became involved in a controversy surrounding the influential \\"Christiania Kunstforening\\", an art society that had a great deal of power in determining what sort of paintings were bought and what was paid for them. The primary complaint, voiced by Christian Krohg, Erik Werenskiold and Frits Thaulow, is that the society was led by lawyers, officers and civil servants rather than artists. They also felt that Disen was being paid too much for what, in their opinion, were inferior paintings, while better artists were receiving too little or being rejected altogether. He was held up as a prime example of their complaint when they called for a boycott of the society. The boycott lasted from 1881 to 1882 and ended with the establishment of a new organization; the H√∏stutstillingen (Autumn Exhibition). Despite his public humiliation, Disen accepted an invitation to participate in the exhibition and did so seven times from 1882 to 1904. He returned to Modum in 1889 and married a cousin shortly thereafter. He never gave up painting in the Romantic style, and gradually became \\"old-fashioned\\".

It is the deepest cave in Northern Europe. Most caves in Rana, of which there are some 200, are not suitable for diving. A popular cave diving destination, Pluragrotta attracts more divers than any other cave in Scandinavia. Visibility in the cave waters is high. The cave's passages were formed by the flow of the Plura river over limestone, and the cave system includes marble formations. A number of species have been identified in the cave ecosystem. Diving became possible in Pluragrotta with the damming of lake Kallvatnet in the 1960s. There have been multiple injuries and fatalities among cave divers at the site, which is accessible year-round. Discovery and exploration Lake Kallvatnet dam reduced flow in the River Plura through valley, opening the cave up to divers. The damming of lake Kallvatnet in the mid-1960s greatly reduced water flow in the partially subterranean Plura river, making diving possible in the cave. The first known dive in Pluragrotta was done by Svein Grundstr√∏m and Bj√∏rn Fagertun in 1980. They are believed to have dived to 135 metres. In 1987 a group of ten Norwegian divers started to explore the Pluragrotta's underwater cave system. Most of the divers was working as Fire brigade-officers in Oslo brannvesen and they did the exploration on their own time without sponsors. By 1997 they had surveyed large parts of almost three kilometers of the subterranean water- filled caves. Their work became known when NRK in 1997 aired a program about it in the series (Out into the Nature) when seven members of Norsk teknisk dykkekrets presented the Pluragrotta on TV. They had a cooperation with S. E. Larutizen at the University of Bergen who at the time were only one in Norway who professionally did research on caves. Exploration has been undertaken by two Norwegian diving organizations, with Norsk Teknisk Dykkekrets doing much of the early surveying and Reel Action Diving continuing the work since 2002. The cave has attracted Finnish divers in recent years, with rivalry developing between Finnish and Norwegian teams. Finnish explorers were the first to discover a connection between the two known entrances: Pluragrotta, and the nearby dry cave Steinuglefl√•get, in September 2013.. Exploration is complicated by the cold water and narrow passages of the underwater cave system, and divers can get lost in its side passages. The connection between Pluragrotta and Steinuglefl√•get caves remained undiscovered for decades, in part because of the difficult access route to the dry cave, Steinuglefl√•get. Reaching its head pool requires a vertical dry-cave climb of over . Visibility in the cave's waters is considered extremely good, with divers able to see up to . An added attraction of the cave is its accessibility in all seasons. Geology The cave system, with its marble formations, lies beneath the Scandinavian Mountains. It was formed by the flow of the river Plura across porous limestone. Sediments, boulders and sands in the cave appear to be periglacial or subglacial in origin. A similar diveable cave nearby is Litj√•ga. Of some 200 caves in Rana, however, most are not suitable for diving, and cave formation has been limited owing to a predominance of granite in the region's geology. Fauna '''' '''' Although the harsh Norwegian climate limits the diversity of cave-dwelling species in comparison with Southern European caves, several invertebrate species have been identified in Jordbruggrotta. No fish are believed to live in the cave. Footage from the 2016 documentary Diving into the Unknown, however, clearly shows a fish in one scene. Species living in the cave include: *'''' *Belba spp. *'''' *'''' *'''' *Leptus spp. *'''' *'''' *Porrhomma convexum *'''' *''''  World Record  Official World Record recognized by Guinness World Records The wedding 10 August 2019 a wedding in Pluragrotta achieved a Guinness World Record as \\"The largest dive access only water-locked wedding ceremony\\". 69 persons participated and the couple to achieve the record was Jani Santala (Finland) and Ina Tr√¶lnes (Norway). The wedding was shown on the TV2 News, and also streamed alive on YouTube. Diving accidents Given the number of divers in the cave, accidents have been relatively infrequent at Pluragrotta. There have, however, been a number of injuries and deaths. In August 1988, a diver exploring the cave tore the right leg of his diving suit on a sharp rock. He survived the incident, suffering only mild hypothermia. On 16 August 2006, a Norwegian diver was reported missing. A team of British divers recovered his body on 28 August 2006. On 6 February 2014, two Finnish divers died at the cave, and another three divers were injured. Survivors suffered from decompression sickness. Norwegian authorities called on an international team, which included British divers Richard Stanton, John Volanthen and Jason Mallinson, to recover the bodies. After reconnaissance diving at the site, the operation was judged too difficult, and a diving ban was subsequently placed on the cave. The Finnish divers involved returned later, without official authorization, and recovered the bodies. Their recovery expedition was filmed as the documentary Diving Into The Unknown. The diving ban was lifted on 31 March 2014.

Lazarat, a town where many people make living off of cannabis Trafficking Drug trafficking first became a major concern in Albania in the 1990s; in that same period cannabis cultivation which had initially been concentrated in the south became more widespread. Albanian cannabis production is sufficient to meet local demand and also export to other areas, though the country continues to import some hashish through Turkey. In the mid-2000s, 77% of the cannabis in Italy originated in Albania. A 2009 report, however, noticed a reduction in the significance of Albanian cannabis exports, and that seizures of Albanian herbal cannabis had \\"become very rare in the last five years.\\" More recently, although still undoubtedly a net exporter, Albanians have begun importing herbal cannabis as well, with an apparent preference for the hashish varieties of the Maghreb. Total production, meanwhile, in Albania, was estimated by Italian financial police to be around 900 tonnes, worth about 4.5 billion euros. Enforcement In 2012, Albania seized 21.2 metric tons of cannabis, nearly twice the amount seized in 2011. Albania made global headlines and \\"placed itself on the cannabis map\\" in 2013 when the Albanian State Police (ASP) tried to shut down production in Lazarat, one of the heaviest producing towns in the mountainous southern regions that are said to be the \\"heartland\\" of Albanian cannabis production. Lazarat's villages, 90% of whom are thought to be involved in the cannabis trade in some way, mounted an armed resistance against the ASP with even a \\"70-year old grandmother\\" involved in the fighting. History It was right after the fall of its communist state that the current large production of cannabis began in Albania. In 1991, criminal groups from Greece began to establish cannabis plantations in southern areas near the Greek border, and the local Albanian farmers embraced an opportunity for some level of financial stability in the turbulent economic situation. In the early days of cannabis production in Albania, trafficking was done by Greek youths who carried bags of cannabis over the mountains across the border, in which Albanian law enforcement found it difficult to control the trade. The new industry took hold quickly despite attempts to curtail it, and it has been reported that in 1995 gunfights between farmers and police were common. Later on, the trade became linked to the Italian mafia, and cannabis was carried to Italy on speedboats going over the Ionian Sea. Due to its aspirations to join the European Union, Albania is under pressure to present a decisive national anti-drug strategy, and in recent years has escalated police crackdown against the cannabis trade, with mixed results, and coordinating efforts with other national governments such as the Italian government.

It premiered on 29 November 2016 on BBC One. Premise The miniseries revolves around the home life of John Christie and his wife, Ethel, as he commits a string of murders during the 1940s and early 1950s. Each of the three episodes tells the story as seen from the respective point of view of the three main characters: Ethel, Timothy Evans and John Christie. Cast * Tim Roth as John Christie * Samantha Morton as Ethel Christie * Nico Mirallegro as Timothy Evans * Jodie Comer as Beryl Evans Broadcast and reception On 29 November 2016, the first episode premiered on BBC One, to largely positive reviews from critics, who applauded the performances and the storytelling. However, it also attracted mixed reactions from some viewers who complained about the \\"mumbling\\" and the \\"inaudible dialogue\\" of the actors. Following the second episode on 6 December, Sarah Doran of RadioTimes.com noted that several viewers had been confused by Mirallegro's use of two different accents while portraying Evans, as the actor switched between Cockney and Welsh accents. However, writers Ed Whitmore and Tracey Malon told the website this had been deliberate, since it was a trait adopted by Evans himself in an attempt to fit into his surroundings: \\"Tim moved to London from Wales around the age of eleven, his half-sister told us he was very keen to fit in and soon adopted a London 'barrow-boy' accent, but that he could slip back into his childhood accent when around members of his Welsh family. Nico [Mirallegro] wanted to reflect Tim's malleability and that desire to fit in by using different accents according to who he was talking to.\\" Internationally, the series premiered on BBC First on 8 February 2017.

Along with Arthur Iberall, Soodak developed the concept of homeokinetics to explain the functioning of complex systems. Biography Soodak was born in New York City. Married to Martha for 55 years, they had three children Deborah, Robert, and Lenore.New York Times obituary Soodak received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York (CCNY) in February 1940, a master's degree from Columbia University, and his Ph.D. from Duke University in 1944.Physics Today Soodak worked on the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where he gave courses on nuclear physics and reactor theory. According to Oak Ridge Director Alvin M. Weinberg, these courses were \\"phenomenally successful\\" and Soodak had the reputation in the United States Atomic Energy Commission of being \\"one of the clearest lecturers in the business.‚Äù In 1945, Harry and Eugene Wigner published the first design of a sodium-cooled breeder reactor. Following work at the Manhattan Project, he served as a Research Associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for nearly three years. In 1949, Soodak joined the Physics Department of his alma mater, City College of New York. He retired in 1992. Contributions Soodak signed the July 13, 1045 addendum to the Szilard petition that asked that the Japanese be given the opportunity to surrender before bombing them.Addendum to Szilard petition Commenting on Soodak's early work, as well as his continuing contributions to nuclear physics after coming to CCNY ‚Äì which included lecturing on nuclear theory in the graduate schools of NYU and of Columbia ‚Äì Mark W. Zemansky, who was then Chairman of the Physics Department at CCNY, wrote in 1958: \\"During the war, Dr. Soodak made a name for himself in the field of reactor design. Through his theoretical work, in books and articles, and his practical applications, he has become a leading international authority on the design of nuclear reactors. There is hardly a handbook or treatise to which he has not contributed or served in an editorial capacity.\\" Without doubt Harry Soodak's greatest legacy is the decisive influence he had on the hundreds of undergraduate students he taught and advised at CCNY. In the 1970s, Soodak began working with Arthur Iberall in an area of complex systems. They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays.Soodak H. and A.S. Iberall.

It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as heterarchy) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems.

She came from a working-class background, yet was able to enroll in the Southern University of New Orleans, SUNO, then a center of student activism. She joined the protest marches and went on to become a prominent activist in the Civil Rights Movement and other causes. Background The 1954 US Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, undermined the legal foundation of separate-but-equal racial segregation. The landmark court decision emboldened the cause for civil rights. The 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi, and the subsequent miscarriage of justice drew national attention to the brutal and unfair treatment of African Americans in the South. In late 1955, the arrest of Rosa Parks led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The boycott lasted almost a year and its success launched the career of Martin Luther King and demonstrated the power of non-violent political action. The first protest marches Oretha Castle participated in were sponsored by the Consumers League of Greater New Orleans (CLGNO). When Castle and several fellow protesters sought support to stage sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, both the Consumers League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) took no interest. The CLGNO and NAACP were involved in sensitive litigations and negotiations and shunned the publicity. In the summer of 1960, Oretha Castle, Rudy Lombard and Jerome Smith pioneered their own organization and sought sponsorship from a national organization. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC, was not active in New Orleans. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) was the first activist group dedicated to non-violence founded in 1942 and based in Chicago. The newly formed Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) rapidly grew in prominence. SNCC's powerbase became the Nashville chapter founded by Diane Nash and John Lewis. Castle and her cohorts chose to ally their local group with CORE, and developed their power base in New Orleans. SNCC and CORE both concentrated on street-level, direct-action activism, and are often compared. The NAACP, SLC, CORE and SNCC cooperated in many endeavors, and each are credited with playing a major role in the success of the Civil Rights Movement. Lombard vs. Louisiana On September 17, 1960, Castle and three of her fellow student-protesters were arrested for sitting in at the counter of McCrory's, a Canal Street five-and-dime store in New Orleans. These protests were based on how stores in Central City \\"wouldn't hire black sales clerks or cashiers, in spite of the fact that the majority of customers in the shopping district were black\\". Oretha Castle, Cecil Carter, Sydney Goldfinch and Rudy Lombard were charged with criminal mischief, \\"which makes it a crime to refuse to leave a place of business after being ordered to do so by the person in charge of the premises\\". There were no laws particularly allowing racial segregation in businesses in the town, however public announcements explaining a zero tolerance on sit-in demonstrations by the Mayor and Superintendent of the police had been made. Those charged were sentenced to a $350 fine and 60 days in prison, or if the fine could not be paid 120 days in prison. This case first went to Louisiana State Trial Court. The case was appealed by CORE attorneys to the Louisiana State Supreme Court, which upheld the conservative decision of the Trial Court. The case was appealed and brought to the US Supreme Court. The USSC, headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, overturned the ruling in an eight to one decision on May 20, 1963. In the opinion to the court Justice Warren indicated that due to the announcements made by public officials, restaurant owners had felt compelled to maintain segregated facilities even if it was not their will or official law. As a result, the court overturned the Trial Court and Louisiana State Supreme Court decisions. Furthermore, the court cited violations to the 14th amendment as grounds for their decision. CORE and the Freedom Rides In 1961, CORE pioneered the Freedom Rides, a novel method of non-violent protest against segregation in interstate transportation. SNCC played a major role. Trained and committed volunteers boarded Greyhound and Trailways buses in Washington DC and other northern cities, and headed south. At various stops, they occupied the whites-only waiting rooms to draw attention to the segregated facilities. The Freedom Rides were scheduled to finish in New Orleans. The first Freedom Riders drew national attention in mid-May. Two buses left from Atlanta, GA heading for Birmingham, AL. The first bus was commandeered by an angry mob in Anniston, AL. The passengers were beaten and the bus was set ablaze. The second group of Freedom Riders made it to Birmingham where they were beaten by a waiting mob as local police stood by. Oretha Castle's home served as the New Orleans headquarters for the Freedom Riders. With help from Oretha's mother Virgie and sister Doris, their home housed and fed hundreds of Freedom Riders coming and going throughout the summer. New Orleans CORE sponsored several Freedom Rides through Louisiana and Mississippi. When two Freedom Riders were beaten in New Orleans in early August, CORE staged a demonstration at Police Headquarters. Oretha Castle was one of fifteen arrested. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was delegated the task of solving the problem. He petitioned and pressured the Interstate Commerce Commission, ICC, and finally on November 1, the \\"whites only\\" signs were removed. The success of the Freedom Rides raised the profile and bolstered the reputation of CORE. Toward the end of 1961 Rudy Lombard departed, and Oretha Castle was appointed president of the local chapter of CORE. A prominent fellow activist characterized her as \\"the guiding force . . . the backbone . . . a woman of extraordinary capabilities.\\" With its new notoriety, the New Orleans chapter of CORE attracted a growing membership. James Farmer had founded CORE to be an interracial organization. In 1962, Castle and her African American cohorts began to the question the participation of whites in their organization. Whites were assuming leadership roles in an organization dedicated to empowering blacks. Castle suspended the white members and came into conflict with the national organization. The national office dispatched Richard Haley to resolve the issue. The suspensions were declared invalid, whites slowly rejoined, yet the chapter never fully regained the members it lost. Haley remained with the organization for the next five years. Castle and Haley married in 1967, and had two sons, in addition to the two sons Oretha was already raising. In 1963 and 1964, nightly marches targeting segregated stores, hotels, theaters and an amusement park continued. The Schwegmann's grocery store chain closed its lunch counters in response to a CORE lawsuit. A Freedom March on city hall resulted in the desegregation of the municipal cafeteria. The 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited segregation in public accommodations, so the protest marches came to an end. The next battle was voter registration. CORE joined a coalition of civil rights organizations that combined their resources for the Freedom Summer project, what became known as Freedom Summer. In the spring of 1964, Castle relinquished her presidency and moved upstate to Ouchita Parish to act as field secretary. In November, she was promoted to field secretary for all of northern Louisiana. For more than a year, Castle applied the protest techniques she had helped to develop in Monroe, Jonesboro and Bogalusa, Louisiana. Freedom Summer accomplished its goal when the 1965 Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting. After 1965 Bayard Rustin and James Farmer pioneered the use of non-violent civil disobedience in the United States inspired by Gandhi and other writers. For almost ten years, non- violent methods led to the many triumphs of the Civil Rights Movement culminating with the March from Selma to Montgomery in March, 1965. In August, the Watts Rebellion initiated three consecutive summers of urban rebellions. Many activists questioned their faith in non-violence, including Oretha Castle. Disenchanted by Selma and other unsuccessful strategies, the Black Panther party emerged. Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) and Charles V. Hamilton wrote the book, Black Power: The Politics of Liberation (1967), encouraging self-determination for black communities. CORE fractured in a dispute over criticizing the Viet Nam War, and many long-time leaders left the organization. The original members of the New Orleans chapter of CORE all quit by 1965, including Oretha Castle. CORE, led by Roy Innis, is still active in New York. Castle returned to New Orleans in 1966 and re-enrolled at SUNO to complete her degree. Her grass-roots organizational experience qualified her to take the lead in several organizations sponsored by the Federal War on Poverty. She led a successful campaign to desegregate public playgrounds. In 1971, she led the election campaign of Dorothy Mae Taylor, who became the first African-American woman state legislator in Louisiana. In the 1980s, she served as deputy administrator of Charity Hospital where she instituted several reforms. While there, she was central in creating the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation. Oretha remained married to Richard Haley until her death, caused by cancer, in 1987 at the age of 48. In 1989, the first eight blocks of Dryades Street in Central City, New Orleans, was renamed Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard. The Central City area and Dryades Street in particular were long the center of a culturally diverse business center in New Orleans. During the turn into the 20th century the area hosted many Jewish, Italian, African-American and German businesses. The area also served black musicians, and black baseball players during the Jim Crow era. Eventually Dryades Street became a focal point for the civil rights movement when Castle Haley and her contemporaries boycotted during the 1960s. After the boycotts many businesses did close, a great deal of commercial activity ceased and was in poor condition for the '60s, '70s, and '80s. In 1989 the city used the naming of the street as a way to \\"revitalize the area\\". In 2015, an exhibit called 'Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard: Past, Present and Future' opened, aiming to explore the \\"rich history and gentrification\\" of the area. In 2017 her namesake street won \\"The Great American Main Street Award\\".

Cheng was both an accomplished poet and calligrapher in the cursive (caoshu) and clerical style (lishu). Her three surviving compositions include Writing to the Regional Inspector of My Feelings While in Prison, Sorrow of the Bronze Bird Terrace and Sorrow in the Spring Chamber. All three are included in the Complete Collection of Tang Poetry, which is the largest collection of Tang poetry, containing some 49,000 lyric poems by more than twenty-two hundred poets. Cheng was imprisoned without trial at the age of sixteen for reasons not completely clear. Her long narrative poem, Writing to the Regional Inspector of My Feelings While in Prison alludes to her defending herself against a knife-wielding intruder. The poem was given to the prefect with the hope of clearing her name of false charges, but her fate is unknown.

In 1796 the London Missionary Society engaged her to take a party of missionaries to the South Pacific. Once she had landed the missionaries she sailed to China and took a cargo back to England for the British East India Company. On this voyage her captain named a variety of South Pacific islands. On her second voyage to deliver missionaries a French privateer captured her off the coast of Brazil on the outward-bound leg of her voyage. First voyage Duff was originally under the command of P. Gordon, with owner J. Carbine and traded between London and Gibraltar.Lloyd's Register (1794), Seq. ‚ÑñD274. Lloyd's Register (1795), Seq. ‚ÑñD238. In 1795 the just formed London Missionary Society decided to send missionaries to the South Pacific. Captain James Wilson volunteered his services and the society was able to afford to purchase Duff. Lloyd's Register for 1796 shows that Wilson replaced Gordon as master of Duff, and Cox & Co. replaced J. Carbine as owner. Also, her trade changed to London-Port Jackson.Lloyd's Register (1796), Seq. ‚ÑñD228. By 1797, her trade was London- South Seas. The London Missionary Society instructed Wilson to deliver a group of missionaries and their families (consisting of thirty men, six women, and three children) to their postings in Tahiti, Tonga, and the Marquesas Islands. Captain Wilson and Duff left The Downs on 13 August 1796 and by 12 November she was at Rio de Janeiro. On 6 March 1797 she reached Matavai (Mahina), where 14 missionaries and their families disembarked. Duff next delivered nine volunteers to Tongatapu on 26 March. One left immediately, and over time the locals killed three. While sailing from Tongatapu to the Marquesas, Wilson became the first European to visit Pukarua, which he found uninhabited and named Searle Island. On 24 May Wilson he sighted Mangareva in the Gambier Islands, which he named for James Gambier, then a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty. The largest land feature on Mangareva is named Mount Duff. At Mangareva Duff stopped at Rikitea. Wilson was the first European to visit Temoe in the Gambiers, which he named \\"Crescent Island\\". By 5 June Duff was at Resolution Bay, in the Marquesas. Here Duff landed William Pascoe Crook. On 6 July Duff was at Matavai again and was at Tahiti by 18 July. On 18 August she was back at Tonga. From there Wilson and Duff sailed for China, arriving on 13 December at Whampoa.British Library: Duff. On this voyage Wilson charted the location of a number of islands. In the Caroline Islands he visited Satawal, Elato, and Lamotrek. In the Fiji Islands Wilson also charted Vanua Balavu, Fulaga, and Ogea Levu. In the Santa Cruz Islands, now part of Solomon Islands, Duff is remembered by the Duff Islands, charted on 25 September 1797. Duff left China 5 Jan 1798 and reached Malacca on 16 January, the Cape of Good Hope on 17 March, and St Helena on 15 April. She was at Cork on 24 June, and arrived at Long Reach on 10 July. Second voyage and loss Duff at Rio Janiero (sic) in 1799 Captain Thomas Robson and Duff left Britain on 20 December 1798. She was carrying a second group of 30 missionaries for the South Pacific. The French privateer Grande Buonaparte captured Duff on 19 February 1799 off Cape Frio near Rio de Janeiro. Her captors took Duff to Montevideo, Uruguay, where they released her crew and passengers. The missionaries finally arrived back at London on 5 October 1799. Her captors sold Duff. Subsequently, Portuguese privateers captured Duff, only to lose her to French privateers. Her subsequent fate is currently unknown.

Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The context of Jamaica‚Äôs history must be considered to understand the political factors that help shape its government and economy.  History  = Jamaican Maroons = During the colonial era, as early as 1512, African slaves who escaped their Spanish conquerors and joined the indigenous people of lands they encountered were called ‚ÄúMaroons‚Äù. The slaves who abandoned the Spanish Colonists in 1655 after the British Colonists‚Äô occupation of Jamaica were known as the Jamaican Maroons. These slaves who managed to escape to their freedom became independent groups who set up their own sovereign communities and coalesced into many heterogeneous groups that maintained their own limited self- government. In 1738, after major uprisings and violent raids of plantations, major sects of the Maroon communities agreed to specific treaties with the British allowing them a limited amount of autonomy and land. The strife and insurrection that led to the First Maroon War and then to a Second Maroon War underscored the necessity to negotiate a treaty with the rebellious Maroon society. The economic instability was a major concern for the government at that time which recognized the importance of subduing the Maroon threat. = Slavery = The Slave Trade Act of 1807 where the British Parliament ended the slave trade in the United Kingdom created a new dynamic in Jamaica between the planter class and the remaining slaves. The treatment of the estimated 300,000 slaves in Jamaica worsened as the planter class intransigently went against the British Parliament's admonishment to treat slaves in a more humane manner. Samuel Sharpe and the Baptist War served as a catalyst to force the British Empire to focus greater attention on the moral and practical issues of slavery. The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 was ultimately passed. Even though slavery was abolished in 1833, there remained a systematic failure to grant equality to the newly freed slaves. The underlying motives of Britain was apparent in their immediate efforts to compensate the slave owners first which gave them the power to dictate such institutions as six-year apprenticeships. In 1865 the Morant Bay Rebellion marked a moment in Jamaican history when the dialogue between the government and the oppressed reached a fever pitch, led by Baptist deacon and activist Paul Bogle. There was confusion between the poor black population and the Maroon population as to where the stronger Maroons' allegiance lay during the siege. It has been said that the Maroons ultimately made a decision to support the British in quelling the uprising on the premise that they wanted to stay loyal to the original treaties between the government and the early Maroon population. John Stuart Mill's social influence on the Jamaican government system was profound because he headed the now defunct Jamaica Committee, which helped create a necessary process of intervention on the behalf of the governed and oppressed that would put into question and challenge the necessity of excessive punitive actions against opposition; ultimately, this helped foster the growing sentiment of freedom of speech.  Politics  = Political developments = Sir John Peter Grant and Sir Henry Wylie Norman had important roles in reshaping the government structure in Jamaica. Their roles in restructuring and reforming the British government system helped modernize Jamaica and pave the way for a new independent party system. In the 1930s, with the activism of labor organizers and unions, the labor movement started and Jamaica gained a greater degree of political control. This saw the development of a duopoly which was composed of two labor organized parties: the People's National Party; led by Norman Manley in 1938, and the Jamaica Labour Party; led by Alexander Bustamante in 1943. In the mid-1940s, the JLP and Bustamante held the majority in Jamaica's limited- autonomy government under the authority of the Colonial office in London and the governor for a decade. Then in 1955 the PNP and Manley gained back the majority. In 1961, Jamaicans favored the stand-alone sovereignty government status proposed by Alexander Bustamante and the JLP to the Federation status proposed by Norman Manley and the PNP. = Independence from the U.K = In 1962, Jamaica was now independent while remaining in the British Commonwealth. Alexander Bustamante was named the country's first Prime Minister. The 1970s saw a rise in crime because of the polarization between the two major parties. Police corruption was on the rise and the political climate was in disarray. In 1972, the PNP regained power with Michael Manley as the Prime Minister. After his election, Jamaica was on a quest to promote and cultivate a more just and equal society. The year of 1976 saw important passages of acts that helped to put more emphasis on promoting human rights. The Status of Children Act of 1976 and the amendment to provide Jamaican women with equal rights to men were watershed moments in the history of human rights in Jamaica.Mark Golding, \\"Justice In Jamaica Over 50 Years Of Political Independence.\\" Social and Economic Studies 61.2 (2012): 22. EconLit with Full Text. Web. 10 Nov. 2016.  Major events  = Controversial legislation = In 1974 the Gun Court Act and the Suppression of Crime Acts were passed under the watch of Prime Minister Michael Manley. Oppressive Immigration policies of the United States towards foreign nationals contributed to the increase in illegal syndicalism in Jamaica. = Police violence = The Montego Bay ‚ÄúStreet People‚Äù scandal was a conspired attempt by the St James Parish Council truck and law enforcement to secretly transport groups of Homeless people in Montego Bay to a St Elizabeth parish to be dumped near a mud lake. Killings of civilians by police in Jamaica remain an important topic in the discussion of human rights. Since the year 2000, out of an estimated 3000 police-related fatalities, only two police officers have been convicted of murder.The Associated, Press. \\"Report: Jamaica Fosters Culture Of Fear With Police Impunity.\\" AP English Worldstream - English (2016): Newswires. Web. 23 Nov. 2016. This statistic is not plausible considering the lack of proper procedure carried out during investigation. As reported by Amnesty International, the government of Jamaica continues to foster a ‚Äúculture of fear‚Äù with the impunity that is afforded law enforcement. On March 14, 2001, a shooting where 60 police officers converged on a house on the peripheries of Kingston, Jamaica gained media attention after the officers shot and killed seven young men at the home.\\"Jamaica 2015 Country Review.\\" Jamaica Country Review (2015): 1. Publisher Provided Full Text Searching File. Web. 10 Nov. 2016.  LGBT rights  Sodomy and/or buggery in Jamaica is a crime that can lead to prison time at hard labour for up to 10 years, however the law is oftentimes not enforced. Sexual behaviour between women is legal. Amnesty International, however, has received reports of violence against lesbians, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Lesbians reportedly have been attacked on the grounds of \\"mannish\\" physical appearance or other visible \\"signs\\" of sexuality. Some reports of abduction and rape come from inner-city communities, where local non-governmental organisations have expressed concerns about high incidences of violence against women. Jamaica has been described by some human rights groups as the most homophobic country in the world because of the high level of violent crime directed at LGBT people. The United States Department of State said that in 2012, \\"homophobia was widespread in the country\\".2012 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Jamaica, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, pages 20-22 References Government of Jamaica ","title":"Human rights in Jamaica"},{"id":"52413283","text":"The 7th Magritte Awards ceremony, presented by the Acad√©mie Andr√© Delvaux, honored the best films of 2016 in Belgium and took place on 4 February 2017 at the Square in the historic site of Mont des Arts, Brussels, beginning at 8:00 p.m. CET.

Trained throughout his racing career in Yorkshire, he showed considerable promise as a juvenile in 1981, winning two of his four races including the Doncaster Stakes. In the following year he emerged as a top- class sprinter, recording his biggest win in the Group One King's Stand Stakes and finishing second in the Prix de l'Abbaye. He was almost as good as a four- year-old when he won the Temple Stakes. He was retired from racing at the end of the year and stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and South Africa but had no success as a sire of winners. Background Fearless Lad was a \\"big, strong\\" chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and two long white socks on his near-side legs bred in England by his owner G Soulsby. He was trained throughout his racing career by Dick Peacock at Middleham in North Yorkshire. He was one of the best horses sired by Import, a sprinter who won the Stewards' Cup in 1975 and the Wokingham Stakes in 1976. His other offspring included the steeplechaser Young Hustler who won the RSA Chase and finished third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Fearless Lad's dam No Fear showed little ability in three seasons of racing, winning one minor race from fifteen starts. She was distantly descended from the influential French broodmare Saint Astra, whose other descendants have included Makybe Diva, Canford Cliffs and Soviet Star. Racing career =1981: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on his racecourse debut Fearless Lad won the Highflyer Stakes over five furlongs at Thirsk Racecourse in September, beating Lavender Dance by two lengths. After finishing second on his next start he carried top weight in the Doncaster Stakes over five furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in October and won by half a length from Special Pleasure. =1982: three-year- old season= Fearless Lad showed moderate form in the early part of 1982, finishing unplaced behind Jester in the Duke of York Stakes in May and fourth to Crofthall at Thirsk Racecourse two weeks later. He then won a minor race over five furlongs at Beverley Racecourse in early June, accelerating clear of his rivals in the closing stages to win by five lengths from Special Pleasure. On 18 June Fearless Lad was moved up to Group One class for the King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot in which he was ridden by Eddie Hide. He started at odds of 10/1 in a fourteen-runner field which included Jester (the 9/4 favourite), Crofthall, Cajun, Lightning Label (winner of the Palace House Stakes) and Peterhof (Flying Childers Stakes) and Lucky Hunter (runner- up in the Middle Park Stakes). After tracking the leader Tina's Pet in the early stages Fearless Lad took the lead inside the final furlong and accelerated away from his rivals to win by two lengths and one length from the fillies Chellaston Park and Blue Singh. On his next appearance at Goodwood Racecourse he sweated up badly before the King George Stakes and ran poorly, finishing unplaced behind Tina's Pet. He failed to recover his form in his two remaining British races that season, finishing sixth behind Sharpo in the William Hill Sprint Championship at York in August and third behind Indian King and Great Eastern in the Haydock Sprint Cup in September. For his final appearance of the year, the colt was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 3 October. Starting at odds of 12/1 he raced in fourth place before battling on in the closing stages to finish second to Sharpo, beaten a length behind the five-year-old winner at level weights. =1983: four-year-old season= Fearless Lad began his third campaign in the Field Marshal Stakes over five furlongs at Haydock Park in April and won easily from Chellaston Park despite looking less than fully fit. In the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in early May he ran \\"splendidly\\" to finish second to the three-year-old On Stage, conceding twelve pounds more than weight-for-age to his younger opponent. Four weeks later Fearless Lad 5/4 favourite for the Temple Stakes at Sandown Park in which he was ridden by Lester Piggott. Chellaston Park was again in opposition but the best of his opponents appeared to be Brondesbury (Norfolk Stakes), Vorvados (Duke of York Stakes) and Sweet Monday (Mill Reef Stakes, Abernant Stakes). After looking outpaced in the early stages as Brondesbury set a very fast pace, but began to make rapid progress along the inside rail in the last quarter mile. He gained the advantage in the closing stages and won by a neck from Boy Trumpeter. At Royal Ascot Fearless Lad attempted to repeat his 1982 success in the King's Stand Stakes and started second favourite behind On Stage. With Hide back in the saddle he finished fifth behind the front-running Sayf El Arab after being slightly hampered in the closing stages. He was then moved up to six furlongs for the July Cup at Newmarket but after sweating up badly before the race he ran disappointingly and finished unplaced behind Habibti. The horse then suffered a series of minor training problems and did not race again. Assessment In 1981 the independent Timeform organisation gave Fearless Lad a rating of 112, 20 pounds inferior to their best two-year- old Wind and Wuthering. In the official International Classification he was given a rating of 75, thirteen pounds behind the top-rated European two-year- old Green Forest. In the following year he was rated 126 by Timeform, four pounds behind their best sprinter Sharpo and described him in their annual Racehorses of 1982 as \\"the best three-year-old sprinter of the season\\". He was again rated 126 by Timeform in 1983, placing him ten pounds behind the champion sprinter Habibti. In the International Classification he was rated the best older male in Britain over sprint distances. Stud record As a breeding stallion Fearless Lad had no success in Europe and was later exported to South Africa where he made little impact. He reportedly died in June 2006 at the age of 27.

The building was originally a Dominican Catholic church called Porta Coeli Church, founded in 1603. The building was completed in 1711, and is an example of Neoclassical architecture. It was originally the church of the Dominican College of Porta Coeli, that came to occupy the entire block between the present streets of Carranza, Pino Su√°rez, Uruguay and the alley of Tabaqueros, the latter separating it from the Concepcionist Convent of Valvanera. Although the college was lost, the church we see today is preserved. The church housed the beautiful colonial Cristo Negro christ, and from 1935 it was moved to the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, the church retains an exact replica. The interior of the church was renovated with eight Byzantine murals painted between 1970-1979, after that was turned into the Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral. It is under the pastoral responsibility of Nicholas James Samra who was appointed leader of the Catholics of Melkite Rite by Pope Francis in 2015.

He usually appears with Qianliyan as a guardian of the temples of the sea goddess Mazu. Name The name \\"Shunfeng'er\\" literally means \\"Wind Accompanying Ears\\" in reference to his ability to hear any sound carried upon the wind. The unusual idiom is translated variously as \\"Ears that Hear with the Wind\\", \\"Ears that Hear what Comes on the Wind\\", \\"Ears that Hear the Sounds Taken with the Wind\\", \\"Wind- Accompanying Ears\\", \\"Downwind Ears\\",. or even \\"Sharp Ears\\", \\"Far-Hearing\\",. or \\"All-Hearing\\". The god's role in helping sailors distinguish favorable winds also prompts the translations \\"Fair-Wind Ears\\" and \\"Favorable-Wind Ears\\".. It also appears as . and . His partner Qianliyan's name similarly means \\"Sharp- Eyed\\" or \\"All-Seeing\\". Under the Ming, Shunfeng'er was also known as ShiKuang. He is also sometimes known as Wanli'er, which has similar meaning, as the Chinese word w√†n‚Äîlike the English \\"myriad\\"‚Äîsimultaneously means the number 10,000 and \\"innumerable\\" or \\"uncountably vast\\". History Shunfeng'er is first attested in the early-16th century novel Journey to the West, where he appears as the personified form of the Taoist Jade Emperor's ears and one of his lieutenants. There is, however, an earlier depiction of him in a Sichuan cave which has been dated to the Southern Song.. The Chinese folk tale about the Ten Brothers also probably long predates its first publication during the Ming Dynasty; in it, the eldest two brothers have powers just like those of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er.. Shunfeng'er next appeared as a lieutenant of the Emperor of Flowering Brightness Hu√°guƒÅng D√†d√¨) in Yu Xiangdou's Journey to the South and as a character in Xu Zhonglin's Creation of the Gods. He was confused with the door god Yul√º Y√πl«ú). Religion stories A green-skinned Shunfeng'er at Tianjin's Queen of Heaven Palace. Shunfeng'er's sharp hearing is employed to help sailors distinguish favorable winds from coming storms. In some accounts, he is capable of hearing everything in the world, no matter how quietly spoken, and was therefore also worshipped as a witness and guarantor of oaths and contracts.. Shunfeng'er is most often portrayed as a demon defeated and tamed or befriended by the sea goddess Mazu. By one account, he and Qianliyan appeared off Meizhou Island during a storm and were defeated by Mazu's magical silk scarf, which blew clouds of sand into their ears and eyes. After their submission, they pledged their loyalty when she kindly healed them of the damage she had caused them.. In another, the two were Song generals who competed for her hand at Peach Blossom Mountain T√°ohuƒÅ ShƒÅn) but were both defeated by her kung fu.. In another, the two were the brothers Gao Jue and Gao Ming. Ruthless generals, they fell at Peach Blossom Mountain and subsequently haunted it as demons. They appeared to Mazu when she traveled nearby and challenged her to battle, with the loser to do the winner's bidding. They intended to have her marry them both but were defeated by her magic and became her servants.. In still another, the Gao brothers were bandits during the Shang before they began to haunt the mountain.. In still another account, the pair were originally warriors or guards of King Zhou of Shang.. In this version of the story, they are sometimes said to have already possessed their superhuman powers and to have used them to foil the first moves towards rebellion by the Zhou. Ji Fa's advisor Jiang Ziya is made out to have been a Taoist adept, however, who uses the esoteric knowledge he received from the Primordial Lord of Heaven on to defeat them. Their powers fail them when he covers them in the blood of a black dog and Ji Fa is able to triumph at Muye and finally establish himself as the Martial King of Zhou (\\"King Wu\\"). Legacy Actors portraying Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er during a parade in Taipei. =Worship= Shunfeng'er most often appears as a door god at Mazuist temples or as a guardian beside Mazu at her altars or on her yellow paper charms. He is separately worshipped in some villages. or by mariners for assistance avoiding danger. During the 8-day, annual pilgrimages from Dajia to Beigang, Mazu's idol is accompanied by figures of Shunfeng'er and Qianliyan played by masked men on stilts.. =In art= Shunfeng'er typically appears as a red- or brown-skinned demon cupping a hand to one of his ears.

Until Bolivia democratized in 1982, the media was strictly controlled. Since Evo Morales was elected, censorship has increased throughout the years, being qualified as partially free by the freedom house, with a 53/100 score on freedom of press (0 the most free and 100 the least free). Evo Morales' government has since tried to control the media and regulate it in his favour. \\"In February 2016, voters rejected a referendum that would have permitted Morales to run for a fourth term. The vote was widely viewed as a rebuke to the president, who responded to it with an attempt to crack down on online media, which he appeared to blame for the referendum‚Äôs defeat. Soon after the vote, the government created the General Directorate of Social Networks, a body within the Ministry of Communications tasked with coordinating the government‚Äôs interactions with online communities. This mission involves efforts to disseminate government-friendly messages online and to engage with government critics on social media, often aggressively. Authorities also proposed a pair of measures that would have imposed greater regulation on online outlets, but they were never implemented. Additionally, in June, Bolivia joined 16 other countries including Venezuela and Cuba in rejecting a UN Human Rights Commission resolution affirming the right to a free, uncensored internet\\". Media = Film = Film and documentary makers in Bolivia and other Latin American countries struggle to make a living creating film, find a large enough audience for their movies, and make their movies impactful yet non-offensive. In Bolivia and Argentina filmmakers have been forced to flee the country as a result of film and censorship laws. In the extreme, documentary film makers in Bolivia have been arrested for defaming Morales in their films. = Radio = Within Bolivia, powerful, wealthy families with connections to the country‚Äôs traditional political groups control the majority, around 80 percent, of radio stations although there are still a handful of stations run by local organizations, government, or other groups. Independent community stations are about four percent of the total number of radio stations. These stations are gaining popularity with Morales as an indigenous president and these stations are overall more popular within indigenous communities. They have a history of serving as a way for marginalized communities to express their identity and dislike of dictators. While legally people are free to talk and discuss any topic, awareness and acceptance of that is taking time to dissipate throughout communities. = Newspapers = Historically, newspapers in Bolivia have been the root and voice of political opposition with the goal of challenging the current and past political leadership. Yet there are many difficulties related to running a newspaper in Bolivia as challenging the political leadership does not lead to high levels of job security and a secure income. Journalists want better working conditions, job training, for media to be free an unrestrained by the government and financial considerations. There is little advertising for newspapers partly because there is readership in a country with low literacy levels. These newspapers have to be careful not to cross the line too much for fear of actions by the state. This environment leads to journalists self- censoring and the proliferation of state run media that is biased towards current political leaders and their parties. While there have been fewer attacks on journalists, there are still many cases that are waiting to work their way through the court system. Gradual improvements in internet access will lead to new environments and opportunities for newspapers and media in Bolivia.  Legal  = Anti-racism law = As a result of historically racist communication between Bolivians of European descent and indigenous Bolivians, Morales created an anti-racism law that prevents against publishing racist media with the goal of protecting indigenous communities. Critics of the law say that racism is poorly defined allowing the government to shut down media outlets that publish what the government loosely defines as racist material. This vagueness means that the government is protecting one group of people while oppressing a different group, media outlets. The elite are afraid that this law will result in them losing power and control. = Social media monitoring = In the past couple of years, Morales has tweeted and talked about the possibility of censoring social media, but he was faced with strong opposition and proceeded to abandon the plan. The idea of this stemmed from tweets that Morales saw as bullying or threatening to his reputation. The opposition‚Äôs case was that there are many more possible opportunities for the government to utilize and embrace social media rather than censor it and be afraid of it. They were also afraid that the proposed social media regulation law would resemble the anti-racism bill‚Äôs vague and broad language which has forced people to self-censor out of fear that what they were writing would be labeled as racist. = Judicial role = Over the years as Evo Morales has become prone to censorship and controlling what people say, he has begun to use economic, legal, and political means to take out independent media. While there is freedom of press in the constitution, Morales continues to act against his enemies. Consistently the court system has been overturning charges and accusations put forth by Morales.

He is widely regarded as one of the most prolific and versatile intellectuals of modern Ethiopia ‚Äì he was a poet, playwright, essayist, translator, historian, novelist, philosopher, journalist, and government officer belonging to the Shewa Amhara nobility and member of the Solomonic dynasty. He has produced about ninety published works in several languages, some of which have been translated into foreign languages, and have greatly influenced twentieth- century Ethiopian literature and intellectual thought. He has received ample recognition domestically and internationally, including an Honorary Doctorate from Addis Ababa University. He is well known as one of the mid-twentieth- century Japanizing Ethiopian intellectuals.  Birth and Infancy  Kebede Mikael, was born on November 2, 1916 in Menz Gerim Gabriel in the Semien Shewa Zone of the Amhara Region to Ato Aytaged and Woizero Atsede Mikael. Soon after his birth, his father, Ato Aytaged, left the country and vanished. Hence Kebede Mikael came to be known under his mother's last name, instead of his father's as prescribed by the standard Ethiopian naming tradition. His mother's brother Lij Seifu Mikael became his father figure and would raise him into adulthood.  Primary and Secondary Education  Kebede Mikael attended Ethiopian Orthodox T√§wa·∏•…ôdo Church education, starting at a very young age. It is reported that his grandmother, Woizero WoleteGabriel, took him to his first day of church education at the age of four at his nearby Gerim Gabriel church that was founded and built by his great grandfather Dejazmatch Mekuria Tesfaye, one of Emperor Menelik's generals, childhood friends and a relative. His mother is said to have instilled a sense of ethics in him by raising him with Christian values, and telling him stories from the Bible. By age nine, he had learned much of the traditional church education and had a good mastery of the church language Ge‚Äôez. In about 1924, when his mother and grandmother moved to Arusi, today's Arsi for work, he went instead to his uncle Lij Seifu Mikael in Addis Ababa where he joined the Catholic Cathedral School as a boarding student. His mother moved back to Addis Ababa in 1929 during which time he was enrolled in the best boarding school in Ethiopia at the time, Alliance √âthio-Fran√ßaise School with the help of his mother's brother (his uncle) Lij Seifu Mikael who was a Sorbonne educated Ethiopian scholar and an important imperial government official. It is said that he grew tired of the punishments by teachers at the school, and thus switched to Lazarist Catholic Mission School for some time. Then, when matters at his former school improved, he switched back to Alliance √âthio-Fran√ßaise. In between, upon his uncle's appointment to administer parts of Harer, the 13-year-old Kebede Mikael befriended Prince Mekonnen and was tasked with tutoring him. Kebede Mikael studied at Alliance √âthio-Fran√ßaise for three years before he got the opportunity to be introduced to the art of literature through the school director, a Lebanese man called Malhabi. The director was himself a novelist and thus wanted to teach the art of writing fiction to six outstanding students of his choice in his own house, and one of the six students was the young Kebede Mikael who had already gone through his uncle's library. The lessons were given in French, and Kebede Mikael proved to be highly proficient and hard-working. During his student years, Kebede Mikael proved that he was highly receptive to learning: he had a strong affinity for the French language, and earned high grades in his French exams. Taking note of his apt command of the French language and his high potential, his school officials recommended him for a scholarship opportunity under the then monarch, Emperor Haile Selassie I. Also impressed by his abilities, the Emperor granted him a full scholarship to go to France and pursue his studies. However excited Kebede Mikael was about the unique opportunity, he could not make use of it because he fell ill at that time. At the suggestion of his uncle, alternative arrangements were set up so that he could instead stay in the palace while he recovered and served as one of three French teachers to Prince Makonnen, the emperor's son, alongside French instructors visiting from France. The plan to send him to France for further French instruction was thwarted by the onset of the five-year war with Italy (1936‚Äì1941), particularly because of the declaration of the Battle of Maychew (1936). It would be the second time for Kebede Mikael to tutor Prince Mekonnen. Kebede Mikael was an avid reader. Although his formal education did not extend beyond high school, his writing was informed by his vast reading, as he revealed in an interview with Yekatit, a widely read Ethiopian newspaper, in September 1980. From his readings, Kebede Mikael was greatly influenced by the teachings of prominent Ethiopians such as his own uncle Lij Seifu Mikael, Aleka Atsimegiorgis, Aleka Kidanewold Kifle, Professor Afework Gebreyesus, Negadras Gebre-Hiwot Baykedagn and Kegn- geta Yoftahe Negussie. At home and school, he used the resources provided by his family and teachers to carefully study the Who‚Äôs Whos of Greek, Roman, English, French, German, Russian, and Italian philosophers and scientists.  Italo-Ethiopian War (1936‚Äì1941)  During the occupation, his uncle and guardian Lij Seifu Mikael was captured and sent off to the Asinara prison in Italy. Woizero Atsede's husband Dejazmatch Melise Sahle submitted to the fascist occupying force. At the behest of his stepfather, he was employed in the fascists' government as a liaison between the Italian officials and the Ethiopian nobility as well as in their Department of Information, then called \\"Office of Propaganda\\". Due to the unique access he had to high-level Italian officials and his command of the Italian language, he passed on important intel to the patriots fighting for the country's liberation. Upon hearing his employment at the occupying fascist government, his incarcerated uncle Lij Seifu wrote: \\"he is an ailing, frail, weak boy who stood no chance in guerilla warfare; let him make use of his brains to assist the resistance.\\" After repeated requests by him and Leul Ras Seyoum Mengesha, his uncle Lij Seifu was released from Asinara after about four years. He reached Addis Ababa four months before the liberation and was ordered to stay under house arrest at his own residence. Even though Kebede could not go to France and pursue his studies because of the Italo-Ethiopian War, Kebede Mikael spent a lot of time reading in the library founded by Mr. LeMoins, one of the French instructors of Prince Makonnen. It is reported that one of the books he most frequently read was Napoleon because he had a great admiration for Napoleon Bonaparte. He also picked up Italian during those years of extensive reading and learning. Italian was only one of the many languages he spoke. He wrote Berhane Helina (The Light of the Mind), which is largely considered his debut, during these years. He also wrote Ye Qine Wubet (The Beauty of Q…ône) in which he proved his command of the unique Ethiopian literary tradition of q…ône (·âÖ·äî), a form of linguistic indirection and play.  Official positions  After the defeat of Fascist Italy, Kebede Mikael served in the government in several capacities between 1941 and 1974 (when Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed). He served as a journalist and radio program announcer; then as Inspector and Vice Director, and later, Director General of the Ministry of Education; as Director General and head representative as well as translator in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1950); Director of the Ethiopian Postal Office; Director of His Imperial Majesty's Private Information Cabinet; and Director of the Ethiopian National Library and Archives (1952). Kebede Mikael also participated in important international conferences as a special representative extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Ethiopian government. He was a regular Ethiopian delegate to numerous international conferences at the United Nations in New York. Even while holding these positions, Kebede Michael did not stop writing. He published a total of 26 books during these thirty-three years of government service.  Later Life and Death  It is said that Kebede Mikael faced many struggles after the revolution of 1974 when the Derg toppled the imperial monarchy headed by Haile Silassie. His extended family members were either in the Derg prison, executed, or fled the country. His cousin, Lij Seifu's son, Kifle Seifu, a prominent businessman of the time was already languishing in the communist Derg prison while his younger brothers were not able to return to Ethiopia from their studies in the US because of the revolution. The family's vast estate that included the National Theater, Ras Hotel, and the vicinity stretching to the Artistic Printing Press, as well as farms, manufacturing, and export businesses run by Kifle and other family members, were all nationalized. The stately mansion of the Seifu Mikael family around the Wabi Shebele Hotel that was built during Emperor Menelik's time and later expanded and modernized during the following three monarchs was confiscated. To some admirers‚Äô dismay, his personal residence was nationalized by the Derg in 1975 because Kebede Mikael was believed to have benefitted from the previous feudal regime and, as a result, he led most of his remaining life alternating between the Awraris and Tourist Hotels in Addis Ababa as residences. Ever since the Derg regime confiscated it, Kebede Mikael's house has gone through an unusual series of rebranding and remodeling efforts: since 1974, it has been used as an office of the local Derg rulers, then a prison for their inmates, a clinic, a bar, a billiard ball game center, and, as recently as 2012, the Menaheriya Hotel, Bar and Restaurant. Residents of the vicinity and his admirers express their disappointment that ‚Äúhis walls, which once were stacked end to end by book shelves, are now stacked with alcohol.‚Äù There has been a call for concerned parties to memorialize his name and legacy in the space. Some sources also claim that he faced some discrimination based on rumors of mental illness in his late years. Those who were children during the Emperor Haile Selassie's regime recall that the emperor used to visit Kebede Mikael and greet the village children, and give them 2 Ethiopian Birr. Kebede Mikael died at the age of 82 on November 12, 1998. June 28th has been designated as a memorial day in Ethiopia to commemorate him.  Honors and Recognition  Kebede Mikael was the first-ever winner of the Haile Selassie I Prize Award in Amharic Literature in 1964, a prestigious award that was later conferred on other Ethiopian literary giants such as Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin. In November 1997, Kebede Mikael received an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Addis Ababa University for his unparalleled excellence in literature and his role as an inspiration to generations of Ethiopian authors and writers. He also received distinguished awards from the governments of other countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, the USSR and Mexico. Those who knew him closely say that he loved to go to church and was a very polite and spiritual man.  Literary works  Kebede Mikael's literary works reflect the many facets of Ethiopian character and behavior during his time. The contents of his books touch upon history, education, development, philosophy, religion, culture, science, ethics and morals, and so on. About five of his books have been translated into the French and English languages. In all his works Kebede Michael used simple Amharic words that can be comprehended by anyone with basic schooling. His translated works presented new, foreign concepts in localized and contextualized words that any Ethiopian could easily understand. A respected multilingual speaker, Kebede Michael spoke over four languages, including Amharic, G…ôÀÅ…ôz, English, French and Italian. He also wrote in or translated from these languages. He produced a plethora of original and translated works ‚Äì ninety of them published and two hundred unpublished. Later on, in the time of the Derg military regime, it is said that Kebede Michael was so frustrated with the tyranny and harassment of the state that he burned a lot of his unpublished works. At least two of his works, Berhane Helina and YeQine Wubet, were written during the Italo-Ethiopian War, but the majority were published after the war. Some were reprinted four times and more due to popular demand. He has produced several poems, plays, anthologies of q…ône poetry, history books, translations, fictions, essays, and philosophical works regarding modernization. Kebede Michael's most prominent translated work is his Amharic translation of Shakespeare‚Äôs Romeo and Juliet. This Amharic version of the play was composed of rhyming verses. He received great acclaim for this work because not only did he show his linguistic competence, but he also combined his poetic talent and play-writing prowess into a single text that flowed beautifully. He also translated Shakespeare's Macbeth, and Charlotte M. Brame‚Äôs Beyond Pardon into Amharic. From 1940 to 1970, Kebede Michael wrote Amharic-language textbooks in which he provided several generations of Ethiopian students with literature covering a wide range of issues and disciplines. Below is an incomplete list of his works. =Educational= * ·ã®·ãï·ãç·âÄ·âµ ·â•·àç·å≠·â≥ (Ye‚Äôewqet Bellichta) [A Spark of Knowledge] (1950) * ·ã®·àò·ã†·àò·à™·ã´ ·ä•·à≠·àù·åÉ (Yemejemeriya Ermija) [First Step] * ·â≥·à™·ä≠·äì ·àù·à≥·àå 1, 2, 3 (Tarikena Missalie) [Proverbs] * ·â≥·àã·àã·âÖ ·à∞·ãé·âΩ (Talalaq Sewoch) [Great People in History] (1963) * ·ã®·ãì·àà·àù ·â≥·à™·ä≠ ·ç©·äõ ·ä≠·çç·àç (Ye‚Äôalem Tarik, Kifil 1) [History of the World, Part 1] (1955) * ·åÉ·çì·äï ·ä•·äï·ã¥·âµ ·à∞·àà·å†·äê·âΩ?

Japan Indemin Seletenech? [How Did Japan Become Civilized?]. The Japanese miracle after the Second World War ‚Äúprovided a model for other Asian and African countries in their quest for rapid modernization‚Äù; so much so that the Japanese founded a famous and well-endowed institution, Institute of Developing Economies to aid those interested in the Japanese model. There was heavy focus on emulating the Japanese developmental and political model in twentieth-century Ethiopia. The popular Ethiopian historian Bahru Zewde writes that intellectuals of the early as well as mid-twentieth century called for \\"Japanization\\" and the \\"rapid development\\" of Ethiopia is to sustain its independence and pride. In his book on the topic, Kebede Mikael provided a summary of how the Japanese aristocracy managed to build a strong, self-supporting, and technologically advanced state under the Meiji Dynasty, and drew lessons from Japan for Ethiopia. He recommended that since Ethiopia and Japan have many socio-economic and political similarities, Ethiopian policy should follow Japan's footsteps toward an advanced economy in the shortest possible time. He pointed out striking similarities between Ethiopian and Japanese histories in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as the fact that they were both peoples of color who enjoyed victories over White European colonizers (Ethiopia against Italy in 1896, and Japan against Russia in 1905); withstood imperial powers in prior history (Japan against the Mongols in the 1280s, Ethiopia against the Ottoman Turks in the 1580s); and drove out Portuguese missionaries at about the same time (during the seventeenth century) to preserve their religions. Politically, both countries were isolated from the world for about 250 years during the medieval period and both states were feudalistic with steep hierarchies. Kebede Mikael wrote that Japan had charted its own course and had maintained its independence in the world, through education. Just like other Japanizers before the Italian invasion, he hoped that Ethiopia would learn from the Japan model. He also pointed out the differences separating the two countries: Japan was more developed relative to Ethiopia even before its contact with the West, especially in shipbuilding and arms manufacture, and Japan had adopted European ways with remarkable speed, while Ethiopia was much slower. Also different was that what Ethiopia's intellectuals had most feared‚Äîthe loss of independence if Ethiopia failed to modernize‚Äîhad already occurred during the Italian occupation of 1936‚Äì1941. There were several attempts to emulate the Japanese economic model in Ethiopia, including the crafting of the contents of the first constitution of Ethiopia in 1931 after the 1889 Japanese constitution. Though these efforts were interrupted by the Italo-Ethiopian War, it was scholars like Kebede Mikael who kept the dream of Japanization alive after the Italian invasion was over in 1941. Keeping the hope of Japanization alive even after the expulsion of the Italians and the Second World War, there was not much progress made before the dictatorial military regime took over in 1974, and negatively impacted the economy with population growth surpassing expansion in food production, agricultural productivity decreasing, and the country experiencing a severe famine in 1984-85.Library of Congress ‚Äì Federal Research Division. Country Profile: Ethiopia. April 2005. PDF. Ultimately, the Japanizer movement in Ethiopia failed, and the scholar Clarke writes that Kebede Mikael's yearnings illustrated a problem, as signaled in Bahru Zewde's criticism of Japanizers. Zewde argues that it is more worthwhile to compare the Japanese victory over Russia in 1905 with Ethiopia's defeat in 1935 and 1936 by the Italians, instead of comparing it with the Adwa victory of 1896, because the Japanese victory was the logical outcome of three decades of fundamental transformation of Japanese society, whereas the Ethiopian defeat ‚Äúwas the penalty for the failure to modernize.\\" Even before the Meiji reformation, Japan had attained a higher state of social development, literacy, agricultural commercialization and specialization than had Ethiopia in the twentieth century.  Legacy and influence  Kebede Mikael has influenced Ethiopian thought, identity, and government through his writing and service in office. His textbooks and general knowledge works have informed the values of young Ethiopian students and widened their literary understanding. Bahru Zewde also writes that Kebede Mikael's writing contributed a lot to the cultural vibrancy of the 1960s. Kebede Mikael's avid support of Japanization informed the development theory and strategy of his contemporary Ethiopia. Even in the present regime, the tendency to emulate East Asian countries‚Äô development models is still seen, as during the rule of Meles Zenawi, the late Prime Minister of Ethiopia, who was set on mirroring South Korean and Taiwanese growth in Ethiopia. Some Ethiopian scholars such as Ghelawdewos Araia subscribe to Kebede Mikael‚Äôs vision for Ethiopian unity and call the present generation ‚Äúto carefully read the vision of Kebede Mikael and seriously consider the currently prevailing narrow and annoying hate politics.‚Äù Araia notes that he subscribes to Kebede Mikael's vision for unity and development because ‚ÄúKebede Mikael uniquely combines both patriotism and a development vision.‚Äù Kebede Mikael also influenced and inspired other Ethiopian literary figures through his works. Tesfaye Gessesse, one of the transformers of Ethiopian theatre, who started out as an actor and later on headed the National Theater in Addis, writes about how crucial Kebede Mikael's play, Yetinbit Qetero was in informing his passion for theatre, saying: > \\"When I was in elementary school, I watched a play entitled 'Yetinbit > Qetero'. The play was written and staged by Kebede Mikael ... I was able to > learn by heart Kebede's poem entitled 'Iroro'.‚Äù No other Ethiopian in the country's history so far has been able to write as extensively on as wide a variety of disciplines as did Kebede Mikael. His contributions to the development of education and literature in Ethiopia were significant. Arefayn√© Fantahun writes that while we associate most other authors with a single, emblematic work, Kebede Mikael produced many: ‚Äú[i]n the case of Kebede Michael ‚Ä¶ what echoes in our [Ethiopians‚Äô] heads is the idea of him as more of an institution than the title of any one book... That institution is the collectivity of Kebede Mikael's literary production‚Äù.  Criticisms  Commenting on Kebede Mikael's world outlook and general writing rationale, Fantahun criticizes him for not celebrating the little man nor condemning cultural failures. He wrote: > ‚ÄúHis world outlook tends to be more universal than particular; more > spiritual than material; more classical than contemporary. And in his > obsessive search for the great men of all time, he tends to forget the > ‚Äòsmall men‚Äô around him who are the vast majority of mankind.‚Äù In his general analysis of Kebede Mikael's works, Fantahun faults him for failing to criticize the shortcomings of the Church which he followed devoutly even when other Ethiopian intellectuals who promoted Christian values like him criticized the church's failings. Fantahun also criticizes Kebede Mikael for being a man of faith and idealism instead of rigorous rational arguments because Kebede Mikael's criticism of Karl Marx and Fredreich Nietzsche (his Superman in particular) was based not on rational arguments, but on his aversion to their promotion of materialism and will to power, respectively ‚Äì two things which Kebede Mikael believed led men away from a spiritual life. While he faulted Nietzsche's Superman for bringing the rise of men like Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler into power, he was a big fan of another such ‚Äòsuperman‚Äô, Napoleon Bonaparte. Thus Fantahun criticizes Kebede Mikael for his inconsistencies. Some Ethiopians, including the famous scholar Mesfin WoldeMariam, claim that Kebede Mikael was unpatriotic, and criticize him for holding office in the propaganda section of the Italian occupiers during the five-year Italian occupation of Ethiopia. However, others defend him saying that he was forced to do it, and would not have labored to produce so many books for the advancement of his country and been so frustrated with the oppression of the Derg had he not been patriotic.

An important aspect to be considered while designing a routing algorithm is avoiding a deadlock. Turn restriction routing is a routing algorithm for mesh-family of topologies which avoids deadlocks by restricting the types of turns that are allowed in the algorithm while determining the route from source node to destination node in a network.389x389px  Reason for deadlock  A deadlock (shown in fig 1) is a situation in which no further transportation of packets can take place due to the saturation of network resources like buffers or links. The main reason for a deadlock is the cyclic acquisition of channels in the network. For example, consider there are four channels in a network. Four packets have filled up the input buffers of these four channels and needs to be forwarded to the next channel. Now assume that the output buffers of all these channels are also filled with packets that need to be transmitted to the next channel. If these four channels form a cycle, it is impossible to transmit packets any further because the output buffers and input buffers of all channels are already full. This is known as cyclic acquisition of channels and this results in a deadlock.  Solution to deadlock  Deadlocks can either be detected, broken or avoided from happening altogether. Detecting and breaking deadlocks in the network is expensive in terms of latency and resources. So an easy and inexpensive solution is to avoid deadlocks by choosing routing techniques that prevent cyclic acquisition of channels. 390x390px  Logic behind turn restriction routing  Logic behind turn restriction routing derives from a key observation. A cyclic acquisition of channels can take place only if all the four possible clockwise (or anti-clockwise) turns have occurred. This means deadlocks can be avoided by prohibiting at least one of the clockwise turns and one of the anti-clockwise turns. All the clockwise and anti- clockwise turns that are possible in a non restricted routing algorithm are shown in fig 2. 390x390px  Examples of turn restriction routing  A turn restriction routing can be obtained by prohibiting at least one of the four possible clockwise turns and at least one of the four possible anti-clockwise turns in the routing algorithm. This means there are at least 16 (4x4) possible turn restriction routing techniques as you have 4 clockwise turns and 4 anti-clockwise turns to choose from. Some of these techniques have been listed below.390x390px390x390px390x390px = Dimension-ordered (X-Y) routing= Dimension ordered (X-Y) routing (shown in fig 3) restricts all turns from y-dimension to x-dimension. This prohibits two anti-clockwise and two clockwise turns which is more than what is actually required. Even then since it restricts the number of turns that are allowed we can tell that this is an example for turn restriction routing. = West first routing= West first routing (shown in fig 4) restricts all turns to the west direction. This means west direction should be taken first if needed in the proposed route. = North last routing= North last routing (shown in fig 5) restricts turning to any other direction if the current direction is north. This means north direction should be taken last if needed in the proposed route. = Negative first routing = Negative first routing (shown in fig 6) restricts turning to a negative direction while the current direction is positive. West is considered as the negative direction in X-dimension and south is considered as the negative direction in Y-dimension. This means any hop in one of the negative directions should be taken before taking any other turn.  Advantages of turn restriction routing * Avoiding deadlocks is less expensive to implement than deadlock detecting and breaking techniques. * Turn restrictions provide alternate minimum length paths as well as non minimum length paths from one node to another, which allows routing around congested or failed links. For example, consider figure 7 below. Say there are multiple routers, F1, F2 etc., that feed packets to a congested, but low-cost link from source router S to destination router D. Implementing Turn restriction routing means that some of the turns from any of the feeder routers to the congested router S may now be restricted. Those feeder routers may have to use a longer path to get to destination D, thereby decongesting the link from S to D to an extent. 310x310px  See also  * Policy-based routing * Deadlock * Heuristic algorithms  References  Internet architecture Routing Heuristic algorithms Concurrency (computer science) Software bugs Software anomalies ","title":"Turn restriction routing"},{"id":"52413724","title":"Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Services"},{"id":"52413734","text":" ","title":"Skyput"},{"id":"52413759","text":"Perfect Imperfection is a 2016 Chinese romantic drama film directed by Chen Bing and starring Ady An and Ahn Jae-hyun.

Early converts were initially from the Northern United States and opposed slavery, believing they were supported by Mormon scripture.http://mit.irr.org/brigham-young-we-must-believe-in- slavery-23-january-1852 After the church base moved to the slave state of Missouri and gained Southern converts, church leaders began to own slaves. New scriptures were revealed teaching against interfering with the slaves of others.D&C; A few slave owners joined the church, and took their slaves with them to Nauvoo, Illinois, although Illinois was a free state. After Joseph Smith's death, the church split. The largest contingent followed Brigham Young, who supported slavery, allowing enslaved men and women to be brought to the territory but prohibiting the enslavement of their descendants and requiring their consent before any move and became The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A smaller contingent followed Joseph Smith III, who opposed slavery, and became the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). Young led his followers to Utah, where he led the efforts to legalize slavery in the Utah Territory. Brigham Young taught that slavery was ordained of God and taught that the Republican Party's efforts to abolish slavery went against the decrees of God and would eventually fail. He also encouraged members to participate in the Indian slave trade. Teachings on slavery Mormon scripture simultaneously denounces both slavery and abolitionism in general, teaching that it was not right for men to be in bondage to each other,D&C; but that one should not interfere with the slaves of others. While in Missouri, Joseph Smith defended slavery, arguing that the Old Testament taught that blacks were cursed with servitude and the New Testament defended slavery, a belief that was common in America at the time. While promoting the legality of slavery, the church consistently taught against the abuse of slaves and advocated for laws that provided protection. Critics said the church's definition of abuse of slaves was vague and difficult to enforce. =Curse of Cain and Ham= Joseph Smith justified slavery using the Curse of Ham. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young referred to the Curse of Ham to justify slavery. According to the Bible, after Cain killed Abel, God cursed him and put a mark on him,() although the Bible does not state the nature of the mark. In another biblical account, Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, Canaan to be \\"servants of servants\\".() While nothing explicitly supports enslaving black Africans, one interpretation that was popular in the United States during the Atlantic slave trade was that the mark of Cain was black skin, and it was passed on through Canaan's descendants, who they believed were black Africans. They argued that because Canaan was cursed to be servants of servants, then they were justified in enslaving Canaan's descendants. By the 1800s, this interpretation was widely accepted in America,Benjamin Braude, \\"The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods,\\" William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103‚Äì142. See also William McKee Evans, \\"From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,\\" American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15‚Äì43John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, \\"'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'\\", American Literary Realism, vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3 including among Mormons. An assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote in a letter that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain, and that the Canaanites were black Africans and covered by both curses. Messenger and Advocate 1:82 In June 1830, Joseph Smith began translating the Bible. Parts of it were canonized as the Book of Moses and accepted as official LDS scripture in 1880. It states that \\"the seed of Cain were black\\" (). The Book of Moses also discusses a group of people called the Canaanites, who were also black (). These Canaanites lived before the flood, and hence before the Biblical Canaan. Later, in 1835, Smith produced a work called the Book of Abraham. It relates the story of Pharaoh, a descendant of Ham, who was also a Canaanite by birth. Pharaoh could not have the priesthood because he was \\"of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood,\\"() and that all Egyptians descended from him (). The Book of Abraham also says the curse came from Noah (). This book was also later canonized as Mormon scripture. In 1836, Smith taught that the Curse of Ham came from God, and that it demanded the legalization of slavery. He warned those who tried to interfere with slavery would face divine consequences. While Smith never reversed his opinion on the Curse of Ham, he did start expressing more anti- slavery positions. In 1844, Smith wrote his views as a candidate for president of the United States. The anti-slavery plank of his platform called for a gradual end to slavery by the year 1850. His plan called for the government to buy the freedom of slaves using money from the sale of public lands. After the succession crisis, Brigham Young consistently argued slavery was a \\"divine institution,\\" even after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued during the Civil War by President Abraham Lincoln. In the year following the Emancipation Proclamation, Young gave several discourses on slavery and characterized himself as neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man. He based his position on the scriptural curses. He also used these curses to justify banning blacks from the priesthood and from holding public office. After Young, leaders did not use the curse of Cain to justify slavery, but this doctrine continued to be taught by President John TaylorJournal of Discourses, Vol. 22 page 304 and Bruce R. McConkie. The LDS Church today does not support slavery and disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse. Most modern scholars believe \\"Canaanites\\" to refer to people of Semitic origin, not black African. Most Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions also reject the teaching that Canaanites were black Africans. = Legality of slavery = Young taught the Emancipation Proclamation went against the decrees of God and predicted it would eventually fail While Mormon scripture taught against slavery, it also taught the importance of upholding the law. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young stated that the Mormons were not abolitionists. In the Book of Mormon, slavery was against the law.( & ) The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that \\"it is not right that any man should be in bondage to another\\" (D&C; ), but it is unclear whether it applied to black servitude, since it was never used either for or against black slavery in early discourses on slavery. The official position which was more often cited was the belief that one shouldn't interfere with slaves against the will of their masters, since it would cause unrest.(D&C; ) This explanation avoided taking a direct stance on slavery, and instead focused on following current laws. In general, Mormon teachings encouraged obeying, honoring and sustaining the laws of the land.() In 1836, Smith wrote a piece in the Messenger and Advocate which supported slavery and affirmed that it was God's will. He said that the Northerners had no right to tell the Southerners whether they could have slaves. He said that if slavery were evil, southern \\"men of piety\\" would have objected. He expressed concern that freed slaves would overrun the United States and violate chastity and virtue. He pointed to biblical stories of slavery, arguing that the prophets who owned slaves were inspired of God, and knew more than abolitionists. He said that blacks were under the curse of Ham to be servants, and warned those who sought to free blacks were going against the dictates of God. Warren Parrish and Oliver Cowdery made similar arguments. During this time the Mormons were based in the slave state of Missouri. After the move to the free state of Illinois, Smith began expressing more abolitionist ideals. He argued that blacks should be given employment opportunities equal to whites.Joseph Smith Views of U.S. Government February 7, 1844 He believed that given equal chances as whites, blacks would become like whites.History of the Church, 5:217‚Äì218 In his personal journal, he wrote that the slaves owned by Mormons should be brought \\"into a free country and set ... free‚Äî Educate them and give them equal rights.\\"Compilation on the Negro in Mormonism, p.40 During Smith's 1844 campaign for president of the United States, he had advocated for the immediate abolition of slavery through compensation from money earned by the sale of public lands.Arnold K. Garr, \\"Joseph Smith: Campaign for President of the United States\\", Ensign February 2002. Smith was killed in 1844, the year of his presidential bid, resulting in a schism among his followers. After the schism, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (later known as the Community of Christ), one of the resulting sects, embraced abolitionist ideals. Its leader following the schism, Joseph Smith III, was a \\"devotee\\" of Abraham Lincoln and supported the Republicans' charge to end slavery. Under Brigham Young, the LDS Church continued to teach that slavery was ordained of God. After he helped institute slavery in the Utah Territory, Young taught \\"inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery\\". He argued that blacks needed to serve masters because they were not capable of ruling themselves, When blacks were treated right, Young contended that they were much better off as slaves than if they were free. Because of these benefits, Young argued that slavery brought the \\"true liberty\\" which God had designed. He taught that because slavery was decreed of God, man was not able to remove it. He criticized the Northerners for their attempts to free the slaves contrary to the will of God and accused them of worshipping blacks. He opposed the American Civil War, calling it useless and saying that the \\"for the cause of human improvement is not in the least advanced by the dreadful war which now convulses our unhappy country.\\" After President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, Young prophesied that the attempts to free the slave would eventually fail.Brigham Young said, \\"Will the present struggle free the slave? No ... Can you destroy the decrees of the Almighty? You cannot. Yet our Christian brethren think that they are going to overthrow the sentence of the Almighty upon the seed of Ham. They cannot do that, though they may kill them by thousands and tens of thousands.\\" = Relationship between master and slave = Slave owners complained that the Mormons were interfering with slaves, but the LDS Church denied such claims. In 1835, the Church issued an official statement that, because the United States government allowed slavery, the Church would not \\"interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men.\\" This was later adopted as scripture.(D&C; ) This policy was changed in 1836, when Smith wrote that slaves should not be taught the gospel at all until after their masters were converted. Church leaders taught that slaves should not be mistreated. In March 1842, Smith began studying some abolitionist literature, and stated, \\"it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice, cruelty, and oppression of the rulers of the people. When will these things cease to be, and the Constitution and the laws again bear rule?\\" History of the Church, 4:544. Under Brigham Young, the Church also opposed mistreatment of slaves. Young urged moderation, not to treat Africans as beasts of the field, nor to elevate them to equality with the whites, which was against God's will. He criticized the Southerners for their abuse of slaves, and taught that mistreating slaves should be against the law: \\"If the Government of the United States, in Congress assembled, had the right to pass an anti-polygamy bill, they had also the right to pass a law that slaves should not be abused as they have been; they had also a right to make a law that negroes should be used like human beings, and not worse than dumb brutes. For their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.\\" Later, as Utah sovereignty became a larger political issue, Young changed his stance on the role of the federal government in preventing abuse, arguing against federal meddling in a State's sovereignty by stating \\"even if we treated our slaves in an oppressive manner, it is none of their business and they ought not to meddle with it.\\" In early Mormonism Initially, Church leaders avoided the topic of slavery. Most of the early converts of the church came from the northern United States and tended to be anti-slavery. These attitudes came into conflict with Southerners after they moved to Missouri. In the summer of 1833 W. W. Phelps published an article in the church's newspaper, seeming to invite free black people into the state to become Mormons, and reflecting \\"in connection with the wonderful events of this age, much is doing towards abolishing slavery, and colonizing the blacks, in Africa.\\"Phelps, W.W. (July 1833), p. 109 Outrage followed Phelps' comments, and he was forced to reverse his position. He said he was \\"misunderstood\\" and that free blacks would not be admitted into the Church. His reversal did not end the controversy.Bush & Mauss 1984, p. 55 Missouri citizens accused Mormons of trying to interfere with their slaves. The Church denied such claims and began to teach against interfering with slaves and more pro-slavery rhetoric. Some slaves owners joined the church during this period. However, this did not end the controversy, and the church was forcibly expelled from Missouri. By 1836, the church already had some slave owners and slaves as members. The rules established by the church for governing assemblies in the Kirtland Temple included attendees who were \\"bond or free, black or white.\\" History of the Church, Vol. 2, Ch. 26, p. 368 When abolitionists tried to solicit support from the Mormons, they had little success. Even though Illinois prohibited slavery, members who owned slaves took them along on the migration to Nauvoo. Nauvoo was reported to have 22 black members, including free and slave, between 1839‚Äì1843.Late Persecution of the Church of Latter-day Saints, 1840 The state of Illinois did not pass laws to free existing slaves in the region for some time. One slave-owning family in Nauvoo was the Flake family. They owned a slave named Green Flake. While building the Nauvoo Temple, families were asked to donate one day in ten to work on the temple. The Flake family used Green's slave labor to fulfill their tithing requirement. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints After Smith's death in 1844, the church went through a succession crisis, and split into multiple groups. The main body of the church, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young who was significantly more pro-slavery than Smith. Young led the Mormons to Utah and formed a theocratic government, under which slavery was legalized and the Indian slave trade was supported. Young promoted slavery, teaching that blacks had been cursed to be \\"servants of servants\\" and that Indians needed slavery as part of a process of overcoming a curse placed on their Lamanite ancestors. =Slavery during westward migration= When church leaders asked for men from the members of Mississippi to help with the westward emigration, they sent four slaves with John Brown who was given the task to \\"take charge of them.\\" Two of the slaves died, but Green Flake later joined the company, making it a total of three slaves arriving in Utah. More slaves arrived as property of members in later companies. By 1850, 100 blacks had arrived, the majority of whom were slaves. Some slaves escaped during the trek west, including one large contingent that escaped the Redd family during the night in Kansas, but six of the slaves were not able to escape and continued with the family to Utah Territory.Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel:John Hardison Redd When William Dennis stopped in Tabor, Iowa, members of the Underground Railroad helped five of his slaves escape, and despite a manhunt, they were able to reach freedom in Canada. =Ambiguous Period (1847‚Äì1852)= Mormons arrived in Utah in the middle of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War; they ignored the Mexican ban on slavery. Instead, they recognized slavery as custom and consistent with the Mormon view on blacks. After the Compromise of 1850, Congress granted the Utah Territory the right to decide whether it would allow slavery based on popular sovereignty. Many prominent members of the church were slave owners, including Abraham O. Smoot and Charles C. Rich.Slavery in Utah Apostle Charles C. Rich, a prominent Mormon slave owner The territory did not pass any laws defining the legality of slavery, and the LDS Church tried to remain neutral. In 1851, apostle Orson Hyde said that because many church members were coming from the South with slaves, that the church's position on the matter needed to be defined. He went on to say that there was no law in Utah prohibiting or authorizing slavery and that the decisions on the topic were to remain between slaves and their masters. He also clarified that individuals' choices on the matter were not in any way a reflection of the church as a whole or its doctrine. Once in Utah, Mormons continued to buy and sell slaves as property. Church members used their slaves to perform labor required for tithing, and sometimes donated them to the church as property. Both Young and Heber C. Kimball used the slave labor that had been donated in tithing before granting freedom to the people. In San Bernardino (1851‚Äì1856) Biddy Mason was one of 14 blacks who sued for freedom after being illegally held captive in San Bernardino In 1851, a company of 437 Mormons under direction of Amasa M. Lyman and Charles C. Rich of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles settled at what is now San Bernardino, California. This first company took 26 slaves, and more slaves were brought over as San Bernardino continued to grow. Since California was a free state, the slaves should have been freed when they entered. However, slavery was openly tolerated in San Bernardino. Many slaves wanted to be free, but were still under the control of their masters and ignorant of the laws and their rights. Judge Benjamin Hayes freed 14 slaves who had belonged to Robert Smith. Other slaves were freed by their masters. Indian slave trade As historian Max Perry Mueller has written, the Mormons participated extensively in the Indian slave trade as part of their efforts to convert and control Utah's Native American population. Mormons also were confronted in Utah with the practice of the Indian slave trade among regional tribes; it was very prevalent in the area. Tribes often took captives from enemies in raids or warfare, and used them as slaves or sold them. As the Mormons began expanding into Indian territory, they often had conflicts with the local residents. After expanding into Utah Valley, Young issued the extermination order against the Timpanogos, resulting in the Battle at Fort Utah. The Mormons took many Timpanogos women and children into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery. After expanding into Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves. A statue of Chief Walkara, a Mormon slave trader. At the encouragement of Mormon leaders, their pioneers started participating in the Indian slave trade. Chief Walkara, one of the main slave traders in the region, was baptized in the church. In 1851, Apostle George A. Smith gave Chief Peteetneet and Walkara talking papers that certified \\"it is my desire that they should be treated as friends, and as they wish to Trade horses, Buckskins and Piede children, we hope them success and prosperity and good bargains.\\" As in other regions in the Southwest, the Mormons justified enslaving Indians in order to teach them Christianity and achieve their salvation. Mormon theology teaches that Indians are descendants in part from the Lamanites, an ancient group of people described in the Book of Mormon that had fallen into apostasy and had been cursed. When Young visited the members in Parowan, he encouraged them to \\"buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could\\". He argued that by doing so, they could educate them and teach them the Gospel, and in a few generations the Lamanites would become \\"white and delightsome\\", as prophesied in Nephi. The Mormons strongly opposed the New Mexican slave trade. Young sought to put an end to the Mexican slave trade. Many of Walkara's band were upset by the interruption with the Mexican slave trade. In one graphic incident, Ute Indian Chief Arrapine, a brother of Walkara, insisted that because the Mormons had stopped the Mexicans from buying certain children, the Mormons were obligated to purchase them. In his book, Forty Years Among the Indians, Daniel Jones wrote, \\"[s]everal of us were present when he took one of these children by the heels and dashed its brains out on the hard ground, after which he threw the body towards us, telling us we had no hearts, or we would have bought it and saved its life.\\" =Legal period (1852‚Äì1862)= Brigham Young promoted slavery as a consequence of the Curse of Ham. One of the Mexican slave traders, Don Pedro Leon Lujan, was charged with trading with the Indians without a license, including Indian slaves. His property was seized and his slaves distributed to Mormon families in Manti. He sued the government, charging that he received unequal treatment because he wasn't Mormon. The courts sided against him, but noted that Indian slavery had never been officially legalized in Utah. On January 5, 1852, Young, who was also Territorial Governor of Utah, addressed the joint session of the Utah Territorial Legislature. He discussed the ongoing trial of Don Pedro Leon Lujan and the importance of explicitly indicating the true policy for slavery in Utah. He explained that although he didn't think people should be treated as property, he felt because Indians were so low and degraded, that transferring them to \\"the more favored portions of the human race\\", would be a benefit and relief. He said this was superior to drudgery of Mexican slavery, because the Mexicans were \\"scarcely superior\\" to the Indians. He argued that it is proper for persons thus purchased to owe a debt to the man or woman who saved them, and that it was \\"necessary that some law should provide for the suitable regulations under which all such indebtedness should be defrayed\\". He argued that this type of service was necessary and honorable to improve the condition of Indians. He also supported African slavery and said that \\"Inasmuch as we believe in the Bible, inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery.\\" He argued that the blacks had the Curse of Ham placed on them which made them servants of servants and that he was not authorized to remove it. He also argued that blacks needed to serve masters because they are not capable of ruling themselves, and that when treated right, blacks were much better off as slaves than if they were free. However, he urged moderation, not to treat Africans as beasts of the field, nor to elevate them to equality with the whites, which he believed was against the will of God. He said that this was the principle of true liberty according to the designs of God. On January 27, Orson Pratt objected to Young's remarks, saying it was not man's duty to enforce Cain's curse, and that slavery had not been authorized by God. Young responded that the Lord had revealed these instructions to him. After this, the Utah legislature passed an Act in Relation to Service, which officially legalized slavery in Utah Territory, and a month later passed an Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners, which specifically dealt with Indian slavery. The acts had a few special provisions unique to slavery in Utah, reflecting Mormon beliefs. Masters were required by law to correct and punish their slaves, which particularly worried Republicans in Congress. Black slaves brought into the Territory had to come \\"of their own free will and choice\\"; and they could not be sold or taken from the Territory against their will. Indian slaves just had to be in possession of a white person, which Republicans in Congress complained was too broad. Indian slavery was limited to twenty years, while black slavery was limited to not be longer \\"than will satisfy the debt due his [master].\\" Several unique provisions were included which terminated the owner's contract in the event that the master neglected to feed, clothe, shelter, or otherwise abused the slave, or attempted to take them from the Territory against their will. Black slaves, but not Indian slaves, were freed if the master had sexual intercourse with them. Some schooling was also required for slaves, with blacks requiring less schooling than Indians. Despite the unique provisions in Utah, many black slaves received the same treatment as in the South. According to former slave Alexander Bankhead, the slaves were \\"far from being happy\\" and longed for their freedom. Justin Smith Morrill attacked the Mormon belief in slavery Mormons continued taking Indian children from their families long after the slave traders left and even began to actively solicit children from Paiute parents. They also began selling Indian slaves to each other. By 1853, each of the hundred households in Parowan had one or more Paiute children. Indian slaves were used for both domestic and manual labor. In 1857, Representative Justin Smith Morrill estimated that there were 400 Indian slaves in Utah. Richard Kitchen has identified at least 400 Indian slaves taken into Mormon homes, but estimates even more went unrecorded because of the high mortality rate of Indian slaves. Many of them tried to escape. Brigham Young opposed slaves who wanted to escape their masters. This was enforced by Utah laws.Brigham Young told Greeley: \\"If slaves are brought here by those who owned them in the states, we do not favor their escape from the service of their owners.\\" (see Greeley, Overland Journey 211‚Äì212) quoted in When Dan, a slave, tried to escape his master, William Camp, the courts upheld that Dan was Camp's property and could not escape. Dan was later sold to Thomas Williams for $800 and then to William Hooper. The Mormon position of slavery was often criticized and condemned by anti-slavery groups. In 1856, the key plank of the Republican Party's platform was \\"to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery\\".GOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia from the Independence Hall Association website While considering appropriations for Utah Territory, Representative Justin Smith Morrill criticized the LDS Church for its laws on slavery. He said that under the Mormon patriarchy, slavery took a new shape. He criticized the use of the term servants instead of slaves and the requirement for Mormon masters to \\"correct and punish\\" their \\"servants\\". He expressed concern that Mormons might be trying to increase the number of slaves in the state. Horace Greeley also criticized the Mormon position on slavery and general apathy towards the welfare of black people. =Emancipation (1862‚Äìpresent)= When the American Civil War broke out, there is some indication that some Mormon slave owners returned to southern states because they were worried that they would lose their slaves. On June 19, 1862 Congress prohibited slavery in all US territories, and on January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The slaves of the Mormons were incredibly joyful when the news reached that they were free, and many left Utah for other states, particularly California. After the slaves were freed, Young gave several discourses on slavery. He characterized himself as neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man. He criticized both the South for their abuse of slaves and the North for their alleged worshipping of blacks. He opposed the American Civil War, calling it useless and that the \\"cause of human improvement is not in the least advanced\\" by fighting such a war. He predicted the Emancipation Proclamation would fail.Millennial Star, No. 50, Vol. XXV, Saturday, December 12, 1863, page 787 https://books.google.com/books?id=f0hQAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA787&lpg;=PA787 =Evaluations by historians= Leaders of the church have had varying opinions on slavery, and many Mormon historians have discussed the issue. Harris and Bringhurst noted that early Mormons wanted to stay neutral or aloof of slavery as a political issue, probably because of the strong Mormon presence in Missouri, which was then a slave state. In 1833, Joseph Smith stated that \\"it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another,\\" but most historians agree that this statement referred to debt and other types of economic bondage. In 1835, Joseph Smith wrote that missionaries should not baptize slaves against the will of their masters. According to Harris and Bringhurst, Joseph Smith made these statements to distance the church from abolitionism, and not to align with pro-slavery positions, but it came across as supporting slavery. Church headquarters were in Ohio, where abolitionism and anti-abolitionism were polarized many citizens. After members of the church were expelled from Missouri to Illinois, Smith changed to an antislavery position, which he held until his death in 1844. More new converts were from free states and a handful of black people joined the church, which may have contributed to Smith's change in position. John G. Turner writes that Brigham Young's stance on slavery was contradictory. In 1851 he opposed abolitionism, seeing it as politically radical, yet he did not want to \\"lay a foundation\\" for slavery. In an 1852 speech, Young was against slavery, but also against equal rights for blacks. Two weeks after the speech, Young pushed to have slavery formally recognized in the Utah territory, stating that he was for slavery, and said that a belief in slavery naturally followed from believing in God's priesthood and decrees. Young mimicked proslavery apologetics when he argued that slaves were better off than European workers and that slavery was mutually beneficial to slave and master. Young feared that abolishing slavery would result in blacks ruling over whites. At the end of 1852, Young commented that he was glad the black population was small. Young was generous with the black servants and slaves in his life, but that did not change their lack of rights. According to Turner, Young's position on slavery is unsurprising given the racial context of the time, as discrimination was common in white American Protestant groups. Turner does note that Young's theological justification for racial discrimination set a discriminatory precedent that his successors believed they ought to perpetuate. According to W. Paul Reeve, Brigham Young was the driving force behind the 1852 legislation to solidify slavery in the Utah territory, and that the common fear of \\"interracial mixing\\" motivated Young. Reeve also states that Mormons were surprised by the Native American slave trade from the Utes. The slave traders would insist that the Mormons buy slaves, sometimes killing a child to motivate their purchase. The 1852 law tried to change slavery into indentured servitude, requiring Mormons with Native American children to register them with their local judge and provide some education for them; the law did not work well in practice. Reeve explains that while Joseph Smith saw a potential for black equality, Young believed that blacks were inferior to whites by divine design. In the Community of Christ Joseph Smith III opposed slavery. Joseph Smith III, son of Joseph Smith, founded the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1860, now known as the Community of Christ. Smith was a vocal advocate of abolishing the slave trade, and followed Owen Lovejoy, an anti-slavery congressman from Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln. He joined the Republican party and advocated for their antislavery politics. He rejected the fugitive slave law, and openly stated that he would assist slaves trying to escape. While he was a strong opponent of slavery, he still viewed whites as superior to blacks, and held that they must not \\"sacrifice the dignity, honor and prestige that may be rightfully attached to the ruling races.\\" In the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) broke from the LDS Church in the early 20th century. Although it emerged well after slavery was made illegal in the United States, there have been several accusations of slavery. On April 20, 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor assessed fines totaling $1.96 million against a group of FLDS Church members, including Lyle Jeffs, a brother of the church's controversial leader, Warren Jeffs, for alleged child slave labor violations during the church's 2012 pecan harvest at an orchard near Hurricane, Utah. The church has been suspected of trafficking underage women across state lines, as well as across the US‚ÄìCanada and US‚ÄìMexico borders,Moore-Emmett, Andrea (27 July 2010). \\"Polygamist Warren Jeffs Can Now Marry Off Underaged Girls With Impunity\\". Ms. blog. Retrieved 8 December 2012. for the purpose of sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual slavery. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: \\"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\\" According to the Vancouver Sun, it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute may not be able to be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change.

Biography  He was born from Leonardo Navarra and Cecilia Triolo of the barons of Sant'Anna, and died during World War I in 1917, at the age of 32. He was an infantry second lieutenant who fell for his country and Silver Medal for Military Valor.Andrea Chiarelli, Dario Cocchiara, Alcamo nel XX secolo, Alcamo, Campo, 2005. At the age of twenty (in 1905), he published a collection of sonnets entitled L'annunziazione, which easily brings back to the name of his model, Gabriele D'Annunzio. As he received several approvals for his compositions, Navarra left his home town to attend the Roman literary circles, where he met D'Annunzio, in the period when the poet was also successful with his dramatic works.. He collaborated with the Italian cultural magazine Scena illustrata and with the French periodical Eclair. In Paris the poet acquired estimate for his oratorical skills which took him to give a series of lectures on literary subjects in Germany and Brazil, where he had the opportunity of sharing his lyrics that were very expressive and full of musicality now mobile and lithe, now slow and serious.  Poetics  I tried to link all the images of my lyrical impetuosity to a dominant Image, more spiritual and higher, free from any restraint and compulsion, not searched with an artificial effort, but offered by itself as a beautiful and very pure thing, always smiling in the bottom of my thought. In his poetry he sings the fullness of life: we drink a scent in each flower and every day we break a chain and exalts the heroic action: tomorrow the hero will come, he will have silver weapons. Navarra nostalgically remembers his domestic peace and the family affections in his youth, worries for loneliness and the premonition of a premature end.la Repubblica.it ‚Äì Navarra poeta e fante un dannunziano in Sicilia In a little essay by the Academy Lo Frutto, dedicated to Navarra \\"a soldjer poet\\" during the dedication of the homonymous junior high school in Alcamo in 1950, the literary critic professor Giuseppe Cottone said: Navarra‚Äôs literary style following that of D‚ÄôAnnunzio, is all in the unlimited devotion to Beauty which was on top of his ideals. A follower of D‚ÄôAnnunzio, then, not so much for love of contemporaneity nor because he was D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs friend, but for a natural and deep affinity of temperament. Gozzano succeeded, so to say, to D'Annunzio, who Nino Navarra approaches for his Arcadian sentiment and for the cult of ancient Greece as the birthplace of spirit. In all his poems there are the ideals and dreams of a twenty-years-old aged poet. Navarra closes his first verse collection with a hope: Soul, be your Faith stronger than Time (...) Soul, I throw you towards Life(...) Now it is better that I prepare my future myself.

A concealed hinge drilling jig is a type of support jig, designed for drilling 3 cm holes to fit concealed hinges into modern wardrobe doors. As many of the complementary tools used in woodworking, it uses an electric hand-drill for its operation, making a Forstner bit to turn. For most concealed hinges to work properly, a pit hole must be created on the door at the point where it faces the static part of the hinge which is screwed to the inside wall of the wardrobe. To create the pit hole, the jig must be fixed in place by means of the provided clamp, spin the Forstner bit by applying an electric hand-drill to its axle. The hole is drilled by pressing the hand-drill until a satisfactory pit hole is created. The purpose of the drilling jig is to hold a Forstner bit in place, at a 90¬∫ angle while drilling 3 cm pit hole. The angle of the tool is critical for the performance of concealed hinges, the jig allows maintaining the 90¬∫ angle over a number of drilling sessions. Types of jigs Drilled pit hole In short, there are mainly two types of concealed hinge jigs, \\"push jigs\\" and \\"hole template jigs\\". Push jigs are used to hold the Forstner bit perpendicular to the door surface and a \\"hole template jig\\" it is simply used for marking the place of the pit hole, placing it parallel to the door edge. There are many styles of jig available commercially. Fundamentally, all push jigs are similar in that they allow the user to clamp the jig tool in some way. The jig then has some means of placing the centre of the Forstner bit into the centre of the marked hole, in a way that a 90¬∫ angle is maintained respect to the door surface. A very common approach is to have a simple cardboard or aluminium template with marks for the distances to the door edges; these type of jigs are normally used with a hand drill fixed to a pedestal, for stability. Many woodworkers prefer to drill pit holes by hand, but requires a bit of practice to achieve a perfectly drilled hole where the 90¬∫ angle is critical. The manual method does not require a jig but it's easier to drill the pit hole using one  Concealed hinges  Concealed hinge shown in open position Concealed hinges are set for furniture doors (with or without self-closing feature, and with or without damping systems). They are made of two parts: One part is the hinge cup and the arm, the other part is the mounting plate. Also called \\"cup hinge\\", or \\"Euro hinge\\", as they were developed in Europe and use metric installation standards. Most such concealed hinges offer the advantage of full in situ adjustability for standoff distance from the cabinet face as well as pitch and roll by means of two screws on each hinge. There are different types Concealed hinges depending on the format of the door where they are fitted: *Straight; *Bent; *Super-bent; There are as well, varying degrees of openness: of 45¬∞, 90¬∞ and 180¬∞ between the door blade and the wardrobe side, and of 165¬∞ (special adaptations for mounting in corners and chamfers).  Forstner bits  Forstner bit for jig Forstner bits, named after their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, flat-bottomed holes in wood, in any orientation with respect to the wood grain. They can cut on the edge of a block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools. The bit includes a center point which guides it throughout the cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers at the edge of the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.

History The Caucus was informally created by Representatives J. D. Hayworth, John Shadegg, Sam Brownback, Bob Barr, and Richard Pombo in the 104th Congress. According to the group, its purpose was to encourage constitutional debate in Congress and the nation and, in time, to restore constitutional government. The Caucus was officially registered as a Congressional Member Organization in 2005 by Congressmen Scott Garrett, Virginia Foxx, and Rob Bishop. In a 2006 interview, the three described themselves as leading \\"...a team dedicated to downsizing the amount of power usurped from the states by the federal government.\\" In 2011, the group's membership grew rapidly following the entrance of new Tea Party-aligned members elected in the 2010 elections. In 2011, the Caucus and the Tea Party Caucus jointly sponsored a closed-door speech to the caucuses by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on the topic of \\"separation of powers.\\" At its peak in the 113th Congress, the Congressional Constitution Caucus had 76 members. However, the caucus possessed over 100 members when it existed informally in the 104th Congress. Ideology and political issues The members of the Caucus are strongly opposed to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and are outspoken opponents of the individual health mandate. The group has supported constitutional challenges to the ACA. In 2014, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected one such challenge in the case Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services (ruling that the ACA did not violate the Origination Clause of the Constitution), the Caucus issued a statement saying \\"The judges got it wrong.\\" According to the founders of the Caucus, the main focus of the Caucus is to \\"ensure the federal government is operating under the intent of the 10th Amendment of our Bill of Rights.\\" The Caucus has worked towards this goal through sponsoring legislation like H.R. 3449, H.R. 1227, and H.R. 1229. Membership As of the 115th Congress, the Congressional Constitution Caucus has 69 members. 68 in the House, and 1 in the Senate.

It was released in Japan on Friday, April 29, 2016. Plot In the 21st century, overpopulation has become such a problem that scientists begin preparing for the colonization of Mars. Their first steps in the terraforming of Mars involve seeding the planet with moss in order to absorb the sunlight and create a hospitable atmosphere as well as increase the surface temperature. They also introduce cockroaches in order to spread the moss. 500 years later, in the year 2599, a manned mission is sent to the red planet to clear out the cockroach colony in preparation for the human colonization of Mars. The crew is an international team of misfits and criminals who are given the opportunity to take part in the mission to gain forgiveness for their crimes. They enter the new atmosphere aboard the BUGS 2 and find the terraforming to have been successful. They release a roach bomb but when they walk onto the surface they do not find any dead roaches among the moss. Eventually they come upon human-sized anthropomorphic cockroaches wielding clubs that quickly kill two of the humans with their superior speed and physical strength. They determine that these creatures are the result of the accelerated evolution of the original small roaches sent by humans to aid in the terraforming efforts 500 years earlier. In order to combat the creatures the team is given a range of specially concocted DNA infusions individually designed to give each member of the team special powers. God Lee is eager to accept the infusion, believing that his powers will also give him added bargaining power when he returns to Earth. He walks on the surface of Mars and injects the DNA when he encounters a giant cockroach, transforming into a miidera beetle (Pheropsophus jessoensis) with the power to emit fire. The cockroach survives the fire blast and kills God Lee. A giant cockroach climbs on top of the spacecraft breaks through its transparent shell, killing two members of the team as it falls. Captain Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a bullet ant (Paraponera clavata) with the power to lift one hundred times his own weight and kills the giant cockroach. Dozens of giant cockroaches swarm into the spacecraft as an expedition team prepares to venture out to grab parts from the BUGS 1, the vessel from the previous mission 10 years earlier, to get the current vessel BUGS 2 into shape to return to Earth. Tezuka injects the DNA and transforms into a Steninae MacLeay then sits on the back of the Mars rover and blows a jet of fire out to propel it across the terrain and kill giant cockroaches at the same time. The captain and Ichiro remain behind to battle the swarm of giant cockroaches. Ichiro injects the DNA and transforms into a sleeping chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki) then removes the oxygen from the vessel to cause the cockroaches to die of asphyxiation. The expedition team encounters a wave of giant cockroaches but they push through it. A second larger wave approaches and the team fears that Tezuka will not be able to survive this one so Osako volunteers to go out to help him. She injects the DNA and transforms into a black weevil Pachyrhynchus infernalis, an insect strong enough to survive being stepped on by an elephant. Mary joins her, injecting the DNA to become a rainbow stag beetle Phalacrognathus muelleri with optical camouflage capabilities. They protect Tezuka as he propels the rover through the second wave. The three are thrown from the vehicle and killed by the giant cockroaches as the rover rolls over and enters into autopilot mode to continue its journey. The remaining members discover and enter the BUGS 1. They find that it was already attempting to send something back to Earth. Outside two more members of the team are shot by giant cockroaches wielding large firearms. It is revealed that Ko Honda, the person who sent the team on this mission, is in communication with the giant cockroaches, who appear to have human intelligence. Keisuke Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a deadly Asian giant hornet while Jim Muto injects the DNA and transforms into a desert locust with flying and powerful kicking and jumping abilities. Zhang Ming-Ming injects the DNA and transforms into an orchid mantis, a carnivorous insect. They then discover giant pyramids on the surface of Mars. Asuka Moriki appears alive aboard the BUGS 2 and transformed into an emerald cockroach wasp, capable of entering the bodies of giant cockroaches and manipulating them. She revives Ichiro with water and they launch the BUGS 2 back toward Earth with a giant cockroach egg on board. The egg hatches and the giant cockroaches inside resist Asuka's manipulation and kill her. Surprised at the new evolutionary advantage of the giant cockroaches, Ko Honda commands the BUGS 2 to fall back to the surface of Mars. The cockroaches aboard the BUGS 2 call for the assistance of the cockroaches on the surface, who sprout wings and ascend into the sky to soften the landing of the BUGS 2. Back on the surface they face the remaining members of the human expedition team, all of whom inject another dose of DNA to transform and do battle with the hordes of cockroaches. Over the course of the battle they discover that taking a second dose will create an enhanced transformation with increased powers. Jim injects a third time, causing irreversible transformation. Shokichi attempts to defend him and is injured. Nanao appears, transformed into a silk moth, and spreads her dust over the cockroach horde. A cockroach fires a weapon at her, causing an explosion that destroys the cockroach horde as well as Nanao. Jim and Shokichi escape the explosion and fly away, only to fall back to the surface where Jim dies in his permanent insect form. Shokichi boards the BUGS 2 again and confronts Ichiro, who saves him from a cockroach attack then suggests that they return to Earth quickly on a two-person spacecraft. As they blast off the cockroaches decide against flying after them. Back on Earth, Sakakibara fears what the reaction will be when Earth learns of their actions. Ko Honda admits that it would be their downfall and suggests preventing the vessel from returning to Earth and then disappearing from Japanese society. She attempts to shoot him but he stops the bullet and tosses a spider at her which releases a toxic purple spray and kills her. The film ends with Ichiro and Shokichi in the small vessel discussing their plans for the future. Shokichi plans to build graveyards for Nanao and every member. Besides, he decides to return to Mars.

In 2018 there were 34 recognised species distributed in Central and South America. Cremastosperma was described by Robert Elias Fries in 1930, based on Aberemoa pedunculata Diels, originally described by Ludwig Diels (1906), which thus became the type species Cremastosperma pedunculatum (Diels) R.E.Fr.. Species of Cremastosperma are found in lowland to pre-montane tropical forest in the Neotropics. The greatest species diversity is distributed in the narrow tropical zone to the west of the Andean mountain chain on the Pacific Ocean side of north-western South America, north into Central America as far as Costa Rica; and on the eastern side of the Andes extending from Colombia through eastern Ecuador and Peru as far south as Bolivia. Two species are found in coastal Venezuela (Cremastosperma macrocarpum Maas and Cremastosperma venezuelanum Pirie), and one in French Guiana (Cremastosperma brevipes (DC.) R.E.Fr.). Description Cremastosperma species are small understory trees with typical Annonaceae floral morphology (sepals and petals in whorls of three; indefinite numbers of spirally arranged stamens and carpels) bearing a resemblance to various other Neotropical genera with apocarpous, single-seeded, stipitate fruits (such as Guatteria). The most useful character by which they can be distinguished from these and other similar Neotropical Annonaceae is displayed by the midrib of the leaves, which is raised on the upper side with an unusual, mostly conspicuous, longitudinal groove.

Nova Scotia is a province in Atlantic Canada totaling 55 284 km2 of land and water bordering New Brunswick. This province houses approximately 3795 farms averaging 262 acres per farm. The total land area used for farm lands in Nova Scotia is 995,943 acres. There is a large range of crops and animals raised in the province and it is a large part of the economy in Nova Scotia. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the overview of the agricultural practices in Nova Scotia.  History  The name Nova Scotia originates from the Latin for New Scotland this reflects the history of the early settlers. Historically much of Nova Scotia was covered with forest, much of this has been reduced by the actions of the settlers. thumb The first peoples of Nova Scotia, the Mi'kmaq, lived as hunters and traders. The Norse adventurers discovered Nova Scotian coasts but it was the Europeans that reached the first agricultural settlement. In the early 19th century much was developed in Nova Scotia including the fishing and tree cutting businesses. Since 1950 there has been a financial struggle, the fishing industry (lobster and shellfish) has helped maintain Nova Scotia.  Major agricultural products  = Crops = Some of the major crops include grains, forages, carrots, broccoli, apples, grapes, blueberries as well as many other fruits and vegetables. Blueberries are a particularly important crop for Nova Scotia. The lowbush blueberry is endemic to Eastern North America and is well adapted to the acidic soils found in Nova Scotia. Lowbush blueberries are typically cultivated on abandoned farmland or other land that is seen as unproductive. There are over 1,000 producers and over 40,000 acres devoted to blueberry production, which makes the blueberry the largest fruit crop in Nova Scotia. Grape production in Nova Scotia is a growing industry that is attempting to increase production. The government of Nova Scotia spent $1 million in 2015 with the goal of doubling grape production by 2020. There are currently 632 acres land in grape production. Nova Scotian growers employ a wide range of grape cultivars in order to create a wines such as L'Acadie Blanc, Castel, Cayuga, Ortega. Many of these cultivars are French hybrid varieties suitable to the cooler climate in Nova Scotia. = Horticulture = Wild flowers such as mayflower, pitcher plant, white water lily and a variety of violets grow throughout Nova Scotia. The Horticulture Nova Scotia (HNS) is a group that help educate people about horticulture in Nova Scotia involving the production, marketing, communication, and business management. = Forestry = The original forests of Nova Scotia took many years for the settlers to clear in order to perform other forms of agriculture on the land. Hardwood and coniferous trees are grown throughout Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia has over 4 million ha of forest, which has always been an important part of the provincial economy. Common soft woods include Eastern white pine, spruce, and balsam fir, as well as hardwoods such as red maple, sugar maple and yellow birch. Nova Scotia also has a well established maple syrup production. The heavy snowfall in 2015 caused damage to farmers trees. In January 2016 $950,000 was invested by Nova Scotia's Agriculture Department to help farmers re-establish their sap collection systems. = Poultry and eggs = Nova Scotia has the largest poultry production in Atlantic Canada with approximately 43 million kg of chicken, and 4.5 million kg of turkey in 2005. Poultry production is governed by supply management, guaranteeing a reliable and affordable supply of product to consumers. There are approximately 84 chicken growers in the province who produce approximately 43 million kg of meat and 17,493,000 dozen eggs annually. = Dairy = Dairy is one of the largest agricultural industries in Nova Scotia. There are 203 farms that are part of the Dairy Farmers of Nova Scotia, the governing body that administers supply management system and sets the price of milk. The production exceeds 206 million litres of milk annually representing approximately $165 million of farmgate revenue per year and providing over 600 jobs. A majority of this milk is processed at one of the 6 dairy processing plants, or 2 producer/processors in Nova Scotia. The remainder being processed out-of- province.https://www.dfns.ca/about/title= Dairy Farmers of Nova Scotia There are two main types of dairy systems in Nova Scotia; pasture-based and confinement-based. Industry trends are pushing Nova Scotian dairy farms toward fewer, larger, confinement-based systems. = Livestock = Livestock production in Nova Scotia consists of beef (108, 500), sheep (25,000), goat (2,000), Pigs (95,000), and Mink (984,000). These livestock are used for different yields such as milk, wool, meat and furs. Global trends of livestock operation consolidation have been hard on Nova Scotian producers. Once considered a world renowned grass fed beef region, Nova Scotian beef producers are at a competitive disadvantage to Midwestern grain producing regions that can export carcasses cheaper than Nova Scotians can import grain. Similarly, the pig industry has been greatly diminished in Nova Scotia and relies heavily on subsidy. = Aquaculture = The aquaculture industry in Canada is small but growing. The increased global demand for animal protein and innovation in aquaculture production systems has seen the sector increase rapidly. Canada's extensive coastline provides many opportunities for aquaculture. There are many different species of both fin-fish and shellfish being farmed in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotian fisheries are involved in gathering haddock, cod, mollusks, scallops and lobsters. Nova Scotian fisheries endeavour to provide protein for a growing global population while mitigating overfishing. Nova Scotia is Canada's largest seafood exporter, accounting for 27% of Canada's total seafood exports in 2015. This can be attributed to the highly productive waters of the region. = Organic Farms = There are approximately 359 farms involved in organic production in Nova Scotia. the majority of these farms are not certified for organic products, 17% are certified, 3.9% are transitioning to certification and 81.9% were not. The majority of the organic crops produce in Nova Scotia are fruits, vegetables, and various greenhouse products.  Economy  The government of Canada has several programs to help the farmers with their costs of production. Many of these programs are contributed to by the farmers themselves as a sort of insurance plan. The government started a new program that will qualify farmers for a tax credit who donate their spare food to the local food banks, this program will be available starting January 1, 2017. The government is also helping tree fruit crop growers due to the losses from a fire blight outbreak, they are providing 2.69 million dollars to help bring this under control and minimize damages. The blueberry industry is always a strong force in the economy of Nova Scotia bringing in 70 million dollars in worldwide exports. The field of aquaculture also has a great influence on the economy, bringing in over 1.68 billion to the province. This looks to increase with the increasing demand and improvement in practices as well as new innovation in farmed fisheries. Agritourism is a new opportunity to grow the economy, this is a great way to increase the sustainability within the farming system. These can include farm markets, wineries, u-picks, and farm based festivals. This can be great for Nova Scotia's economy because the province has very rich farming history and culture. Although other barriers do exist such as product development, government support, marketing, education and training.  Other  = Water = There are over 3000 lakes as well as many rivers and streams throughout Nova Scotia. The water in Nova Scotia has also been very important to the forestry sector throughout its history. The provincial government of Nova Scotia has helped with the land use planning in many areas such as the Annapolis Valley in an attempt to reduce the groundwater issues and drinking water contamination. Local governments have also sought to re-mediate these issues by working with the community to understand what needs to be done. The education of the land owners is most important when trying to protect the water sources. = Soil = There are many areas throughout Nova Scotia that have very fertile soil such as the Annapolis valley and Cornwallis Valley. The soils in Nova Scotia are mostly acidic. 29% of land is suitable for agriculture. The best land is in the lowlands were the soil has had the opportunity to develop into deeper soils. The soils in the uplands tend to be shallower and more rocky thus less fertile. These fertile lands in the marshlands consist of fertile alluvial flood plains and river valleys. these land are easily cultivable land thus they were used a lot by the settlers. = Topography = The land Nova Scotia varies from coast to coast with rugged coastlines, inlets, islands, coves and bays to large lowlands connecting the various parts of the landscape. In these lowlands there are various valleys that have been formed during the Triassic period. Areas such as the Bay of Fundy are now very important to the field of agriculture because of the marshlands formed by the high tides, once dykes were built these lands could be harnessed for crops. These dykes were built by the French Settlers in order to secure the salt they needed for curing the fish, this land was later used for agriculture, and these structures have since been built and kept by the Department of Agriculture.

It contains one species, O. volans, named in 2016 by Dzik and Sulej. Description CT scans and drawings of the skull Ozimek was a small animal, with a length of about . Its limbs were long, with the hindlimbs being generally longer than the forelimbs, and its feet were large. The limbs likely supported a membrane of skin that was used for gliding between trees, much like the similarly proportioned Sharovipteryx. While the forelimbs of the latter are unknown, they were likewise probably similar to those of Ozimek. The skull of Ozimek is relatively fragmentary; from the identifiable fragments, the skull appears to have been diapsid, broad, and compact, with the jugal bone forming a complete arch. The preserved portions of the jaw show numerous small, sharp teeth. There appear to have been 9 cervical vertebrae, 16 dorsal vertebrae, 3 sacral vertebrae, and at least 7 caudal vertebrae (the tail is incompletely preserved). The cervical vertebrae are very elongated and thinly-walled, with the fourth, fifth, and sixth being the longest. Several gastralia are preserved; they suggest that the underside of the animal was gently convex. The most unique aspect of Ozimek's anatomy is perhaps its coracoids, which probably fused with the sternum. They are large and plate- like, and each coracoid bears two holes (or fenestrae); the anterior hole may be homologous with the coracoid foramina found in other animals, but the origin of the posterior hole is unclear. Additionally, the scapula is low and crescent-shaped, and the fifth metatarsal on the foot is curved and unusually robust, a feature that is associated with efficiently standing up and accelerated locomotion among diapsids (analogous to the mammalian heel). Discovery and naming Elements of the holotype specimen Ozimek is known from the mudstone and claystone beds of the Krasiej√≥w quarry in Poland. The layers of rock exposed in this quarry, based on comparisons with other sites, dates to the Late Carnian, approximately 230 million years ago. It is known from the holotype specimen, a partial, articulated skeleton catalogued as ZPAL AbIII/2512, along with four other articulated skeletons and 30 other fragmentary specimens. The genus name, Ozimek, is derived from Ozimek, the nearby town of the same name. The species name volans (Latin \\"flying\\") refers to its possible gliding lifestyle. Classification The long neck of Ozimek resembles that of other derived members of the Protorosauria; in particular, it shares many of the characteristics of Sharovipteryx, which was the basis of its assignment to the group Sharovipterygidae in 2016. On the contrary, its robust fifth metatarsal on the foot is reminiscent of the more derived archosauromorphs Azendohsaurus and Prolacerta. A 2019 phylogenetic analysis incorporating Ozimek found it as a member of the Tanystropheidae, as a close relative of Langobardisaurus and Tanytrachelos. This may suggest that both Ozimek and Sharovipteryx are members of the clade. Paleoecology The Krasiej√≥w quarry represents a lacustrine environment; the long neck and gliding membrane of Ozimek presumably was an adaptation to hunting insects in the surrounding forest. Other large vertebrates from Krasiej√≥w include the aquatic Metoposaurus and Parasuchus, as well as the terrestrial Stagonolepis, Silesaurus, Cyclotosaurus, and Polonosuchus.

Biography  His father was an apothecary and amateur painter who gave him his first lessons. His first drawings were promising and, at the age of twelve, he entered the √âcole des Beaux-arts de Lyon, where he studied engraving with and . In 1861, he won first prize at a painting and lithography contest held by the \\"Soci√©t√© des Amis des Arts\\". From 1865 to 1868, he worked as an illustrator and was a decorative painter for the workshops of Antoine Sublet. In 1869, aged only twenty-three, he had his d√©but at the Salon. His career was, however, interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War, when he enlisted in an artillery battalion and took part in the defense of Paris. After demobilization, he created many realistic scenes of battlefields. The Acrobats After 1872, he exhibited regularly in both Lyon and Paris, where his works sold well and received good critical notices. He used his earnings to make an extended visit to Spain, which had a permanent influence on his style. After his father's death in 1881, he returned to Lyon and remained there for the rest of his life. The following year, he was married. Over the next few years, he joined several art societies and professional associations. In 1888, he was named a member of the advisory board at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon and replaced his old Professor, Danguin, at the √âcole. He became the Director there in 1894, by ministerial order. Under his leadership, the √âcole was awarded the Grand Prix at the Exposition Universelle (1900) and four students received the Prix de Rome. That same year, he was named a Knight in the Legion of Honour.Documentation @ the Base L√©onore. Due to weakening eyesight, he resigned his position at the √âcole in 1918 and died two years later. A major retrospective of his work was held in 1997 and a street near his studio has been named after him.

According to the IMF, Kazakhstan maintains a good balance of payments ratio and looks relatively stable economically. Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF has the obligation to \\"exercise surveillance\\" over its policy members. This means that they look after the economic, financial, and exchange rate policies of its members, including Kazakhstan and meet approximately once a year with Kazakh government and national bank officials.  History  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Republic of Kazakhstan officially became a member of the IMF on July 15, 1992. The first project in Kazakhstan was made with the goal to restructure the banking system, first by licensing and tightening regulations, and second by making the necessary regulatory and institutional structural reforms. The IMF states that from the start of this project in 1996 to the end of 1997, the major goals were accomplished and a major financial collapse was avoided. As a result of the 2014 drop in oil prices, Kazakhstan was affected significantly, especially with the oil and gas trade. Central Asia and Caucasus region suffered an economic decline of 5.5%. Kazakhstan's inability and delay to open new oil and gas fields exacerbated the problem. Another effect of the collapse of oil prices is that the currency, the tenge, has seen a drop in value of 50% of the dollar as of January 2016. While the national bank was printing more money and causing inflation to occur at 7.4% and 13.6% in 2014 and 2015, respectively, the national bank has since lowered inflation to 6.8% in 2016. This was within the target range for the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK).  Current Issues  = Buffer Zone = As a result of the oil price drop, Kazakhstan had to adjust. Announced by President Nursultan Nazarbayev in November 2014, Nurly Zhol (Bright Path) was a program meant to stimulate the economy by investing in infrastructure, energy projects, tourism, etc. The project will total around $9 billion (USD). Under the 2015 Consultation the IMF had with Kazakh officials, the IMF believed that the stimulus package was justified and had enough buffers to keep it from being affected by other economic factors, including the fall in oil prices. The IMF also suggested, however, there needs to be reforms to increase the revenue base by medium-term fiscal accommodation, such as reforming the tax code to gain more revenue. They also propose that the NBK focuses their monetary policy on controlling inflation. The IMF reports that if the NBK can manage and lower the expected inflation would allow the NBK to ease and ensure price stability. = Response to the price drop = 11% of all exports go to Russia, making it the second- biggest trading partner in terms of exports after China (14%). However, 33% of all of Kazakh imports come from Russia. When Russia was affected by the 2014 fall of oil prices, oil became cheaper to import from Russia and as a result, the Kazakh economy suffered. Kazakhstan responded with the depreciation of the tenge by looking into the non-oil economic sector. For example, aiding car manufacturers because or farmers for having sustained losses due to the imports of cheaper Russian goods. Kazakhstan is also vulnerable to social unrest, particularly in regions like Mangyshlak and Atyrau which depend on oil. Clashes between oil workers in western Kazakhstan and riot police in 2011 left several dead, and the Kazakh government continues to worry about this issue. The IMF has made a positive economic forecast to the Kazakh economy, expecting its GDP to grow 3.4%, which is lower than previous years, but is climbing again along with the non-oil economy which is expected to rise 4%. While the 2017 consultation ended with the praise of Kazakh officials for being able to respond quickly and gauge effectively the impacts of the situation, the IMF also believes that structural changes do need to be made in order to keep Kazakhstan from becoming too vulnerable from swinging commodity prices and loss in oil revenue.

Along with Nancy Tan Soo Keow and Patricia Koh Kim Toh (both of whom later served with the Singapore Police Force), Fong voluntarily signed up for military service and was commissioned as an officer later that year after completing an officer cadet course. In an interview with Pioneer, a publication by the Singapore Armed Forces, Fong said: \\"The early years were particularly frustrating. I was working in various logistics departments then. A few other women officers joined me later but we felt we were not contributing to the nation as much as we could. Nobody trusted women much those days and we were assigned unimportant tasks that were quite irrelevant to an officer's grooming.\\" Fong, then holding the rank of Captain, made history in 1979 when she was made Commanding Officer of the 1st Air Supply Base. It was the first time in Singaporean history when a woman was appointed as a commanding officer. When asked about how she felt, she replied, \\"I'll try hard to respond to the challenge. After all, I've more than my own future prospects to lose.

The family then received a letter from Duluth, Minnesota, on April 21, 1990, that indicated that Kerze may have lied to gain usage of the van and the writer indicated they did not know where Kerze was going. Kerze had an O.F. Mossberg & Sons 20-gauge shotgun with him, although he had not taken any ammunition. Authorities have speculated that he may have discarded the gun but they are not certain of that. The van was located abandoned two days later on April 22, 1990, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Searching for Christopher After Christopher's disappearance, posters were distributed and extensive searches were made in an attempt to find him. In 2004 an anonymous letter was received by the Eagan Police Department suggesting they should stop trying to find Kerze and he would return home when he is ready.

Hypercube networks consist of nodes, which form the vertices of squares to create an internetwork connection. A hypercube is basically a multidimensional mesh network with two nodes in each dimension. Due to similarity, such topologies are usually grouped into a -ary -dimensional mesh topology family, where represents the number of dimensions and represents the number of nodes in each dimension. Different hypercubes for varying number of nodes  Topology  Hypercube interconnection network is formed by connecting N nodes that can be expressed as a power of 2. This means if the network has n nodes it can be expressed as : N=2^m where m is the number of bits that are required to label the nodes in the network. So, if there are 4 nodes in the network, 2 bits are needed to represent all the nodes in the network. The network is constructed by connecting the nodes that just differ by one bit in their binary representation. This is commonly referred to as Binary labelling. A 3D hypercube internetwork would be a cube with 8 nodes and 12 edges. A 4D hypercube network can be created by duplicating two 3D networks, and adding a most significant bit. The new added bit should be ‚Äò0‚Äô for one 3D hypercube and ‚Äò1‚Äô for the other 3D hypercube. The corners of the respective one-bit changed MSBs are connected to create the higher hypercube network. This method can be used to construct any m-bit represented hypercube with (m-1)-bit represented hypercube.  E-Cube Routing  Routing method for a hypercube network is referred to as E-Cube routing. The distance between two nodes in the network can be given by Hamming weight of (number of ones in) the XOR-operation between their respective binary labels. The distance between Node 1 (represented as ‚Äò01‚Äô) and Node 2 (represented as ‚Äò10‚Äô) in the network given by: (Hamming\\\\\\\\_weight(01\\\\bigoplus10)=Hamming\\\\\\\\_weight(11) = 2 E-Cube routing is a static routing method that employs XY-routing algorithm. This is commonly referred to as Deterministic, Dimension Ordered Routing model. E-Cube routing works by traversing the network in the kth dimension where k is the least significant non-zero bit in the result of calculating distance. For example, let the sender's label be ‚Äò00‚Äô and the receiver's label be ‚Äò11‚Äô. So, the distance between them is 11 and the least significant non-zero bit is the LSB bit. Figuring out which way to go for a ‚Äò0‚Äô or ‚Äò1‚Äô is determined by XY routing algorithm.  Metrics  Different measures of performance are used to evaluate the efficiency of a hypercube network connection against various other network topologies. = Degree = This defines the number of immediately adjacent nodes to a particular node. These nodes should be immediate neighbors. In case of a hypercube the degree is n. = Diameter = This defines the maximum number of nodes that a message must pass through on its way from the source to the destination. This basically gives us the delay in transmitting a message across a network. In case of a hypercube the diameter is n. = Average distance = The distance between two nodes defined by the number of hops in the shortest path between two particular nodes. It is given by the formula - d_a= \\\\sum_{d=1}^r{(d.N_d)\\\\over N-1} In case of Hypercubes the average distance is given as n/2. = Bisection width = This is the lowest number of wires that you should cut in order to divide the network into two equal halves.

Workers first encountered a bundle with the torso of a female. Throughout May and June, various parts of the same body were found, with the exception of the head and upper chest. The investigation concluded that the body had not been dissected for medical purpose, but that a degree of medical knowledge had been necessary to perform the dissection.

The Times newspaper had initially suspected that the arm was placed in the water as a medical students' prank. On 17 October 1888, reporter Jasper Waring used a Spitsbergen dog, with the permission of the police and the help of a labourer, to find a left leg cut above the knee that was buried near the construction site. =Elizabeth Jackson= On 4 June 1889 a female torso was found in the Thames, and more body parts were soon found in the Thames the next week. The London Times reported on 11 June that the remains found so far \\"are as follows: Tuesday, left leg and thigh off Battersea, lower part of the abdomen at Horsleydown; Thursday, the liver near Nine Elms, upper part of the body in Battersea Park, neck and shoulders off Battersea; Friday, right foot and part of leg at Wandsworth, left leg and foot at Limehouse; Saturday, left arm and hand at Bankside, buttocks and pelvis off Battersea, right thigh at Chelsea Embankment, yesterday, right arm and hand at Bankside.\\" The investigation concluded that medical knowledge had been necessary to perform the dismemberment. At the inquest held by Mr Braxton Hicks on 17 June it was stated that: \\"the division of the parts showed skill and design: not, however, the anatomical skill of a surgeon, but the practical knowledge of a butcher or a knacker. There was a great similarity between the condition, as regarded cutting up, of the remains and that of those found at Rainham, and at the new police building on the Thames Embankment.\\" The London Times of 5 June reported that \\"in the opinion of the doctors the women had been dead only 48 hours, and the body had been dissected somewhat roughly by a person who must have had some knowledge of the joints of the human body.\\" She was about eight months pregnant. The doctors were also this time unable to establish a cause of death. The jury, however, reached the decision of \\"Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\\". Though the head was never found, the victim was identified as Elizabeth Jackson, a homeless prostitute from Chelsea. =Pinchin Street Torso Murder= Contemporary illustration of the discovery of the Pinchin Street torso On 10 September 1889 Police Constable William Pennett found the headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman under a railway arch at Pinchin Street, Whitechapel. It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dispersed for disposal.; A woman's torso was found at 5:15 a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel.Eddleston, p. 129 Extensive bruising about the victim's back, hip, and arm indicated that she had been severely beaten shortly before her death, which had occurred approximately one day prior to the discovery of her torso. The victim's abdomen was also extensively mutilated in a manner reminiscent of the Ripper, although her genitals had not been wounded.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, p. 316 The dismembered sections of the body are believed to have been transported to the railway arch, hidden under an old chemise.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 210; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 480‚Äì515 The age of the victim was estimated at 30‚Äì40 years.Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 489‚Äì510 Despite a search of the area, no other sections of her body were ever found, and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified. Chief Inspector Swanson and Commissioner Monro noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat.Report to the Home Office by Swanson, 10 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 136‚Äì40, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 480‚Äì482; Report to the Home Office by Monro, 11 September 1889, HO 144/221/A49301K ff. 1‚Äì8, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 492‚Äì494 The pathologists, however, noted that the general bloodlessness of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death.Report of Dr Charles A. Hebbert, 16 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 146‚Äì7, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 496‚Äì497; inquest testimony of George Bagster Phillips, 24 September 1889, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 509‚Äì510 Newspaper speculation that the body belonged to Lydia Hart, who had disappeared, was refuted after she was found recovering in hospital after \\"a bit of a spree\\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 213 Another claim that the victim was a missing girl called Emily Barker was also refuted, as the torso was from an older and taller woman. Swanson did not consider this a Ripper case, and instead suggested a link to the Thames Torso Murders in Rainham and Chelsea, as well as the \\"Whitehall Mystery\\".Report to the Home Office by Swanson, 10 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 136‚Äì40, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 210‚Äì213 and Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 480‚Äì482 Monro agreed with Swanson's assessment.Report to the Home Office by Monro, 11 September 1889, HO 144/221/A49301K ff. 1‚Äì8, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 213 and Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 492‚Äì494 These three murders and the Pinchin Street case are suggested to be the work of a serial killer, nicknamed the \\"Torso killer\\", who could either be the same person as \\"Jack the Ripper\\" or a separate killer of uncertain connection.Gordon, R. Michael (2002), The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London, McFarland & Company, Links between these and three further murders‚Äîthe \\"Battersea Mystery\\" of 1873 and 1874, in which two women were found dismembered, and the 1884 \\"Tottenham Court Road Mystery\\"‚Äîhave also been postulated. Experts on the murders‚Äîcolloquially known as \\"Ripperologists\\"‚Äîsuch as Stewart Evans, Keith Skinner, Martin Fido, and Donald Rumbelow, discount any connection between the torso and Ripper killings on the basis of their different modi operandi.Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 480; Fido, p. 104; Rumbelow, p. 132 Monro was replaced as Commissioner by Sir Edward Bradford on 21 June 1890, after a disagreement with the Home Secretary Henry Matthews over police pensions.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 217 Associated cases Outside the four canonical cases which were filed by the police as belonging to the same series, there were additional cases which has been linked to the Thames Torso Murders. =Battersea Mystery= The Battersea Mystery is the name given to two unsolved murders that took place in London in 1873‚Äì74.R Michael Gordon: The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London, 2002 On 5 September 1873, the left quarter of a woman's trunk was discovered by a Thames Police patrol near Battersea. Subsequently, a right breast was found at Nine Elms, a head at Limehouse, a left forearm at Battersea, a pelvis at Woolwich, until an almost complete body of a dismembered woman had been found. The nose and the chin had been cut from the face, and the head had been scalped. Under the leadership of the Acting Chief Surgeon, Metropolitan Police, Thomas Bond, the corpse was reconstructed. The attempts to identify the remains were disturbed by the curiosity of the public, and the police first showed a photograph to any potential witness. The Lancet reported: :\\"Contrary to the popular opinion, the body had not been hacked, but dexterously cut up; the joints have been opened, and the bones neatly disarticulated, even the complicated joints at the ankle and the elbow, and it is only at the articulations of the hip-joint and shoulder that the bones have been sawn through.\\" The jury passed a verdict of \\"Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\\".Inquest into the death The case remained unsolved, in spite of a ¬£200 reward being offered for information. In June 1874, the dismembered body of a female was discovered in the River Thames at Putney. The corpse lacked head, both arms and one leg, and had been treated with lime before being thrown in the river. The jury returned an open verdict. The case remained unsolved. M.J. Trow: The Thames Torso Murders = Tottenham Court Road and Bedford Square Mystery = The Tottenham Court Road Mystery was reported by the Times on 24 October 1884. They said about the discovery of women's remains. Discoveries include: * A skull, still with flesh attached to it. * A chunk of flesh from a thighbone Near to Tottenham Court Road, in Bedford Square, a woman's arm was found in a parcel. This arm had been tattooed, showing it might have belonged to a prostitute. A human torso was found in a parcel by a police constable as he passed 33 Fitzroy Square, five days later. The parcel was believed to have appeared between the hours of 10:00 and 10:15. Evidence was presented in an inquest on 11 November, held at St Giles Coroner's Court. This concluded how the body parts came from a woman and how they might have been divided by someone who was skilled but not for the purpose of anatomy. The inquest was later resumed on 9 December. More evidence was presented and showed how it was skilfully dissected and came from a woman, as stated by Dr Jenkins. This evidence was the right arm and the right and left foot, along with the right forearm of a single individual. These two mysteries still remain unsolved. =Le mystere de Montrouge and Lambeth Mystery = In his 2002 book The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London, R. Michael Gordon suggests there may be a link to a murder in Paris in 1886, as well as to another murder in London in 1902. In November 1886, a woman's torso was found on the steps of the Montrouge church in Paris, missing the head, legs, right arm, left breast and uterus. In June 1902 a woman's torso was found in Salamanca Alley in Lambeth in London. No suspect was identified in either case. Speculation Newspapers suggested a tie to Jack the Ripper's killings of prostitutes that were occurring simultaneously, but the Metropolitan Police said there was no connection. It is debatable whether Jack the Ripper and the \\"Torso killer\\" were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area. The modus operandi of the Torso killer differed from that of the Ripper, and police at the time discounted any connection between the two. Fiction *In the opening scenes of \\"The King Came Calling\\", the third episode of the first series of the television programme Ripper Street, which takes place in 1889, Edmund Reid (Matthew Macfadyen) conducts an experiment to try and discover where Elizabeth Jackson's remains were dumped into the river; the ambiguity over Jackson's \\"provenance\\" leads to a dispute with Reid's opposite number in the City of London Police, who wants jurisdiction over the case. * The 2013 novel Mayhem by Sarah Pinborough is based on the Thames Torso murders and includes newspaper articles from that time.

Due to safety reasons the bridge is excluded from heavy vehicle traffic. History According to the report of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts the structure was assigned to the second half of the 18th century AD (Maratha rule) based on architectural ground and building materials. The present bridge has been placed directly on top of the structure which had been started as early as 13th century AD by Bhanu Deva I (1266‚Äì1278) of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty and continued by Narasimha Deva II (1279‚Äì1306). He reconstructed the Atharanala bridge for proper discharge of surplus water of that time Saradhar rivulet with an additional culvert thus increasing its total number to nineteen (290 ft long). Legends The bridge is to be built by Maharaja Indradyumna. The construction process was unsuccessful until, by the order of the Lord Jagannath, he offered the heads of his eighteen sons into the water of the river. If a non-Hindu is caught trespassing inside the Jagannath Temple in Puri the entire Prasad must be thrown away from Atharanala bridge. Architecture Atharanala bridge is made of laterite and lime mortar with ashlar masonry building technique, in medieval architectural scheme of pillars and arches. It is oriented north to south. The bridge spreads over a length of 85 meter (280 feet) and breadth of 11 meter (36 feet) and encompasses eighteen arches (\\"athara\\" means eighteen, \\"nala\\" canals or passages) ranging from seven to sixteen feet across. The bridge offers a spectacular long distance view of the Jagannath Temple. The fa√ßade is decorated with reliefs of deities, people, nayikas, genre scenes and floral decorations: Brusaarudha Siva, Ekapada - Bhairava, Ardhanarisvara, Parvati, Gajabhisekha Laxmi, Durga Mahisasuramardini, bharabahaka, people playing musical instruments, sakha mouldings, Kartika, Navagraha panel, lotus medallions, elephant figures and boar hunting scenes. Maintenance Atharanala Bridge in 2012 Renovated and repaired by Archaeological Survey of India the bridge was found in good condition. However, high siltation and growth of vegetation was gradually closing the openings of the bridge. The urban pressure was another risk identified. It was decided by the Odisha state government in 2014 (before Nabakalebara 2015) to start beautification of the bridge by removing the moss and mud heaped near the bridge and facilitate boating to attract tourists to the spot.

Lebar (July 29, 1925, Richmond, Virginia ‚Äì December 23, 2009, Baltimore, Maryland) was an American engineer who constructed the television cameras used during the Apollo program. Biography During World War II, Lebar served as a shooter with the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, then studied electrical engineering at the University of Missouri until 1950. In 1953, he joined Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Baltimore. In 1964, Westinghouse was commissioned by NASA to develop a TV camera capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures of the Moon and weighing only seven pounds instead of the then 400 pounds. After five years, Lebar was the head of a team of 75 engineers and technicians and more than 300 manufacturers. This black-and-white camera finally transmitted the first steps of Neil Armstrong on the Moon during the television transmission of the Moon landing in 1969. Lebar's innovations to cameras affected technology as a whole. Later, Lebar also developed a color television camera for the Apollo program, as well as the cameras for the Skylab space station. For the successful development of this camera and the color television transmissions of the Apollo program, the company Westinghouse received an Emmy in the technology category, which Lebar accepted in 1970.Outstanding Achievement in Technical/Engineering Development Awards.

Its congregation was known as the Brotherhood of the Carpenter. Founded in 1890 by the Reverend William Dwight Porter Bliss, the church sought to promote the cause of economic justice and influenced many of its members to take an active interest in the labor movement. Notable members included educator and activist Vida Dutton Scudder, sculptor Anne Whitney, novelist William Dean Howells, poet Robert Treat Paine Jr., city planner Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, and photographer Francis Watts Lee.  History  On Sunday, April 13, 1890, the Reverend William Dwight Porter Bliss held the first service of the Church of the Carpenter in Brunswick Hall, 241 Tremont Street, Boston. Bliss explained his intent to the audience that crowded the hall: > We are not here to commence a revolution. We are here simply, quietly, > humbly to consider the application to social problems of the old gospel of > the carpenter who lived in Nazareth... Change is everywhere. Christendom > today is heaving with a divine unrest, as she has not moved since the days > that preceded the Protestant reformation. Tolstoi in Russia, Stuart Headlam > in London, Dr. McGlynn in New York city, voices in the Greek, the Anglican, > the Roman Catholic communion, all speak of change, and they all move in one > direction, the application of Christianity to social life... The church of > the carpenter is the church of the Son of Man. It is the church of humanity. > It means sacrifice, the sacrifice of the individual, the sacrifice of self > for the good of all. This is Christian socialism....we must work through the > State and better the conditions of men as well as work through individuals. The Church of the Carpenter was not a new denomination or sect, but a mission of the Episcopal Church under Bishop Phillips Brooks. It was incorporated as a parish of the Diocese of Boston, with Bliss as rector, on June 5, 1892. The church followed the Episcopal liturgy, but welcomed people \\"of any church or of no church\\". In 1892 the church was located in the Wendell Phillips Hall at 812 Washington Street; in 1893 it moved to 3 Boylston Place. Notable members included educator and activist Vida Dutton Scudder, sculptor Anne Whitney, novelist William Dean Howells, poet Robert Treat Paine, Jr., city planner Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, and photographer Francis Watts Lee. The socialist writer Laurence Gronlund spoke at the church and contributed to The Dawn, a Christian Socialist journal edited by Bliss. Robertson James, the younger brother of Henry James, attended the church and wrote an article for The Dawn about his father's socialist leanings. Other notable visitors included the Reverend R. Heber Newton, economist Richard T. Ely, and authors Edward Everett Hale, Edward Bellamy, and Hamlin Garland.Kirk (1959), pp. 188, 199-200, 205. Bliss served as rector of the parish from 1890 to 1894 before embarking on a career as a traveling lecturer for the Christian Socialist Union. The church disbanded in 1896.  Influence  In her memoir, Simkhovitch cites the church as an important influence on her while she was still in college. At the time, there was a bookshop on the ground floor, and a reading room and chapel on the second floor. Its senior and junior wardens were prominent union organizers. On Sundays, the Brotherhood held \\"supper meetings\\" in the basement, where they discussed social problems of the day. The church influenced many young people to take an interest in the labor movement, including the socialist priest Percy Stickney Grant, who was a frequent visitor. Bliss's ministry inspired Herbert N. Casson to found the Labor Church in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1894. Towards the end of his life, Bliss characterized himself as a middle-class reformer who attracted \\"more leaders than led\\", and recalled \\"many mistakes and short-comings\\" in his organization of the Church of the Carpenter. \\"I would hesitate long before advising a young clergyman to start its counterpart today. Perhaps it may teach what not to do.

As the time for obligatory jumma prayer approached, a Kashmiri stood up to deliver the adhan. The Dogra governor, Ray Zada Tartilok Chand, ordered his soldiers to open fire on them, in total 22 Kashmiris died in the firing. According to Weekly newspaper,\\"The Kashmiri Musalmaan\\", Lahore, 10 May 1931-On 29 April 1931 which was verified by Kashmir history researcher Dr.Ashraf kashmiri, \\"Muslim at Jammu while offering Eid prayers , the Dogra DIG Chowdry Ram Chand and another police officer ,Babu Khem Chand ,told the imam Atta Ullah Shah Bukhari (or Mufti Muhammad Ishaque ) to stop the mandatory Friday khutbah in which he spoke about the cruel king of ancient Egypt Pharoah as indicated in Quran and accused him of making the political speech against the king.A young man Mir Hussain Bakhsh stood up to defy the ban and addressing the people told them that the Government had been guilty of interference in their religion. The cry was taken up by the congregation; they marched in a procession to the city‚Äôs main Masjid where a brief meeting was held condemning the incident. Chowdary Gowhar Rehman, secretary of newly established Young Men‚Äôs Muslim Association took a serious exception to this religious interference and held a protest meeting.The meeting was addressed by Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas Khan, Sardar Gauhar Rehman Khan, and Mistri Yakub Ali. Holding protest meetings from now on became quite frequent. The Muslims brought a complaint in the court of Additional District Magistrate under section 296 ,Ranbir Penal Code against the Hindu inspector for disturbing a religious assembly which was dismissed, as the Hindu Magistrate held that Khutba was not a part of the prayers. A large crowd of Hindus who were present in the court premises raised the slogans: \\"Khem Chand Zindabad\\" and \\"Hindu Dharam Ki Jai\\". According to another news-paper, According to daily \\"Inquilab\\" dated 1/7/1931,\\"Another incident, on 4 June in the Central Jail Jammu.one Fazal Dad Khan, a police constable from Mirpur, was sitting on a cot when a Head Warder, Balak Ram, reprimanded him for being late on duty. In the meantime came one Labhu Ram Sub-Inspector who threw away his bedding in a fit of recklessness. It contained a copy of Panj Surah (five chapters from the Quran). Fazal Dad approached the Young Men's Muslim Association. (Khan, Freedom movement in Kashmir, p. 126). The Youngmen‚Äüs Muslim Association at once issued a poster, calling upon all the Muslims of the State to hold protest meetings. The valley Muslim respond to call positively, and started peaceful protests. According to Resident to Pol. Secy, Government of India, 11 July 1931, File No.35-P(Sec)/1931; Rough Note on Political Situation op.cit., pp. 2‚Äì3,verified by Dr.Ashraf kashmiri, On 6 June, deputed G.E.C. Wakefield, his political Minister, to go there and investigate the matter. Wakefield met the representatives of all the eight Islamia Anjuman of Jammu on 9 June. He asked them to choose two members, and, along with them, investigated the whole matter the next day. Yet, in a Press Communiqu√©, the Maharaja deplored the incident, and, on the recommendation of the Enquiry Committee, retired Labhaya Ram from service. According to Abdullah, Sheikh Mohammed, Atish-i-Chinar (Urdu), op.cit., pp. 80‚Äì82,Naturally concerned at these ominous developments, Maharaja Hari Singh had, some days ago invited a deputation of Muslims from both Jammu and Kashmir to meet him for talks. But while Youngmen‚Äüs Muslim Association of Jammu chose four members of their deputation, namely, Mistri Yaqub Ali, Sardar Gohar Rahman, Chowdhry Ghulam Abbas and Sheikh Abdul Majid in a small meeting . On contrary, the valley based leaders decided to call for public meeting to reach a consensus for future discourse Government, and also to foster unity among the otherwise divided ranks among themselves. Accordingly, convened a public meeting at the Khanqahi Mualla of Srinagar on 21 June.About one lakh of Muslims were said to have gathered by this time and the Sheikh, then, one by one announced the names of seven men and got the approval of the gathering for their inclusion in the deputation which was to meet the Maharaja. The members included Saad- ud-Din Shawl, Mirwaiz Moulvi Yusuf Shah, Mirwaiz Ahmadullah Hamdani, Aga Syed Hasan Jalali, Khawaja Ghulam Ahmad Ashai, Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah, MunshiShahab-ud-Din,chowdary Ghulam abaas and other leaders from Jammu . The people carried the dead through the streets of Srinagar, chanting slogans opposing Dogra brutality. The incident shook the state, and a week-long period of mourning was observed. Traffic between Srinagar, Rawalpindi and Jammu was halted from 13 to 26 July. The protests intensified; anti-Hindu riots began, leading to the death of three Hindus, the wounding of many more and the looting of Hindu-owned shops. The Hindus retaliated, leading to more clashes between the two groups. The violence spread to Kashmir province and Jammu; three British companies, numbering about 500 soldiers, were sent to support Maharaja Hari Singh and restore law and order. The incident led to the rise of young Sheikh Abdullah, and his rivalry with the maharaja continued until 1947.  Meeting with the maharaja  Muslim representatives, including Mirwaiz Yusuf Shah, Mirwaiz Hamadani, Syed Hussain Shah Jalali, Saad-ud-din Shawl, Sheikh Abdullah, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai, Yaqub Ali, Munshi Shahab-ud-Din, Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas and Gauhar Rehman, addressed the maharajah on 15 August. They made a number of accusations against Hindus in general and the state administration and prime minister in particular, alleging that evidence given to the Riots Enquiry Committee was fabricated or suppressed. The maharaja refused to dismiss the prime minister, and rejected the Muslim leaders' allegations as \\"unfounded\\".  Temporary truce  The Muslim leaders were dissatisfied, but they met with the prime minister on 26 August and signed an agreement to end the agitation.  Aftermath  The agitation temporarily subsided, primarily because of the Kashmir Darbar's conciliatory attitude toward its subjects (permitting Ahrar-i-Islam, Mazhar Ali Azhar and two companions to visit Kashmir privately). With the intervention of Muslim sympathisers outside Kashmir, 14 August was observed as Kashmir Day in Kashmir and several parts of India. Demonstrations and meetings were held in sympathy with Kashmiri Muslims. The meetings adopted resolutions calling for freedom of religion, the restoration of mosques and Muslim shrines, compensation for dependents of those killed or injured, and an investigation of the conduct of civil and military officers during the agitation.

Martin resides in the Melbourne suburb of Doncaster, and has worked from his Northcote-based studio at Arts Project Australia since 1989, where he has also had numerous solo shows. He has exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally [see Exhibitions] and in 1994 he was a finalist in the prestigious Mo√´t & Chandon Travelling Fellowship. In 2014 he was the winner of the Australian State Trustees Connected art prize. His work is held in several public collections, including the Deakin University Art Collection, the City of Melbourne Art and Heritage Collection and Monash University Museum of Art.  Early life and education  Martin was diagnosed with autism at the age of two and was supported and encouraged by his parents, who claimed that his diagnosis had ‚Äòcemented‚Äô their family and that he showed signs of ‚Äòpromise.‚Äô He attended a program for special-needs children, but did not start making art until approximately the age of ten. During his time at an autism-specific school, which he attended for several years, he ‚Äúwon a minor art prize,‚Äù however the early promise identified by his parents was not realised until 1989, when an instructor at the Adult Day Centre at which Martin attended recognised his artistic talent. Shortly thereafter he began working at Arts Project Australia, an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although Martin received no formal training, his participation in the studio program at Arts Project Australia gave him access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. It was one such artist who, in the early 1990s, suggested the use of a mirror as a drawing aid, which eventually led to the development of his signature depictions of mask-like faces executed in pastel. These early works were exhibited in Martin‚Äôs first solo show, entitled Pastel Drawings at the Australian Galleries in Collingwood, Melbourne.  Career, themes and style  Both Martin‚Äôs lack of formal training and autism have identified him as one of the key figures within the Outsider Art category in Australia. This categorisation is confirmed by his repeated inclusion in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and Alex Baker, former curator of contemporary art at the National Gallery of Victoria has likened his works to those of American Abstract artists of the 1930s and 1940s such as Adolph Gottlieb, William Baziotes and Ad Reinhardt, claiming that they are similarly characterised by ‚Äúpictographic, biomorphic and hard-edged abstraction.‚Äù A highly prolific artist whose works number in the hundreds and are stored in the archival collection of Arts Project Australia, Martin‚Äôs work has developed from early abstracted monochrome figures and profiles into a practice which combines source material found in newspapers and magazines with the bold, flattened geometric repetition of form that has become his ‚Äúsignature style.‚Äù Recent works are drawn from mainly photographic and physical sources ranging from depictions of Hollywood celebrities, politicians and sports stars to an eclectic range of kitchen utensils, tools, letters and logos. The expansion of subject matter in recent work has been accompanied with a more textural and layered use of the familiar pastel medium - Baker notes the use of etching implements to create works which are ‚Äúabraded, scoured and pitted,‚Äù stating that they stand as ‚Äútestimony to the artist‚Äôs vigorous process.‚Äù  Solo exhibitions  * Julian Martin Solo, No Vacancy Project Space, Melbourne, 2015 * Julian Martin: Transformer, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2014 * Julian Martin New Work, Kitty Somerset, Northcote, 2011 * Draw, Manningham Gallery, Melbourne, 2009 * Julian Martin Recent Works, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2006 * New Works, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2003 * Sempiternal Variations, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2001 * Pastel Drawings, Australian Galleries, Collingwood, 1995  Selected group exhibitions  * Here and Now, Sofitel Melbourne on Collins, Melbourne, 2016 * Measurably Long Kool, Fleisher Ollman, Philadelphia, USA, 2016 * Paper Projects, La Trobe University, Melbourne, 2016 * The Outsider Art Fair 2015, (Fleisher/Ollman booth), New York, USA, 2016;

Early life Argent was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, the son of motor engineer Godfrey Stanley Albert Argent, and his wife, Helena (n√©e Smith). He had two sisters. He was educated at Bexhill Grammar School, and then briefly entered the police constabulary, where he first learned photography. Career In 1954, Argent joined the Royal Horse Guards, Household Cavalry, serving with the Life Guards for nine years. In 1960, he became an Associate Member of the Royal Photographic Society and won the British Army Photographic Competition. He photographed Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, who encouraged him to pursue photography instead of staying in the military. Argent later recalled being told by Templer, \\"Don't get to my age and then regret what you might have been.\\" Templer recommended Argent to Sir John Miller, the Crown Equerry, who hired him to photograph the Royal Mews for a guidebook. Argent was commissioned to take the photographs for Judith Campbell's book The Queen Rides, published in 1965, which featured the Queen with her horses at Windsor Castle, Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. He served as royal photographer until 1974, given unparalleled access to the Queen and her family. Among his notable portraits include Prince Charles for the postage stamp marking his investiture as the prince of Wales in 1968, and the group portraits for the royal family's Christmas cards from 1966 to 1974. His most extraordinary royal portrait was probably his 1967 photo session with Princess Alice of Battenberg, mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who had fallen ill. Worried she may not survive, the Queen sent Argent to the King Edward VII Hospital to photograph Princess Alice, who was usually dressed as a nun in her later years, but was in her hospital gown. They were the final portraits taken of Princess Alice. In 1967 Argent became the official photographer for the National Photographic Record at the National Portrait Gallery. From 1967 to 1993 Argent also served as official photographer for the Royal Society, photographing scientists Stephen Hawking, Sir Peter Medawar, Dorothy Hodgkin and Francis Crick. He joined the photographic agency, Camera Press, founded by Tom Blau, who represented Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield, Cecil Beaton, Norman Parkinson and Yousuf Karsh, the latter whom Argent admired the most. Argent had London studios in Queen's Gate and then in Holland Street in Kensington, where he became a celebrated photographer of prominent businessmen, families and soldiers. He also purchased the archives of prominent photographers Walter Bird and Baron. Personal life Argent was married three times. In 1956, he married Janet Boniface, with whom he had three daughters. After her death in 1969, he was briefly married to Anne Coxon, whom he divorced in 1973. In 1975, he married Sally McAlpine, with whom he had another daughter. They were divorced in 1990. He died in London in 2006, age 69, of oesophageal cancer. In 2007, the National Portrait Gallery established the Godfrey Argent Award for its annual portrait competition, awarded for the best black and white photograph or the best photographer under aged 25.

Several of her principles were progressively adopted in legislation as part of the Chilean Constitution of 1925, which modified the Chilean Civil Code and Law Decree No. 328. Brandau never practiced law, and excelled in intellectual and educational pursuits. She was a member of the Athenaeum and an advocate for gender equality and the civil rights of women. She was also a promoter of women's education, serving as an educator and director of several secondary schools for girls, such as those of Linares (1905‚Äì1907), Constituci√≥n (1908‚Äì1913), and Iquique (1915). On two occasions she was sent by the government of Chile to Europe, in 1907 and 1927, to learn about women's education in Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy. During the first trip, her husband Jos√© Luis Ross Mujica (whom she had married in 1907, and who was serving as Chile's consul in Spain) died of appendicitis. On her return to Chile, Brandau took over as director of the Lyceum No. 2 of Valpara√≠so. She managed the acquisition of the land for the institution's building, and its first stone was laid in 1937. The school is now named after her. She was also deeply involved in cultural activities, founding a literary center and developing the French Library, the People's University of Iquique, the Protective Society of Poor Students, the School Settlements, and the Iquique Children's Trust.

He debuted in sumo wrestling on January 2013 and made his makuuchi debut in November 2016. His highest rank has been maegashira 8, and he has one special prize for Fighting Spirit. He wrestles for Miyagino stable. Background Ishiura was born in Tottori, the principal city of Tottori Prefecture, which is the most sparsely-populated prefecture in Japan. He studied at Nihon University. He nearly gave up sumo and moved to Australia to study at an English language college in 2012. While there he won the Australian Open and Lightweight Sumo titles and while staying in Sydney was cast as an adversary for Wolverine in a new X Men movie, but he withdrew from the role and decided to return to Japan and try professional sumo after being inspired by the success of some of his friends from his amateur days. At 23 he was at the upper end of the age limit to enter professional sumo and knew this was his last chance. As of 2019 he still wrestles under his real name and is yet to adopt a formal shikona or ring-name. Ishiura is of unusually small stature for a sumo wrestler: when he made his makuuchi debut at he was officially lighter than any other competitor in the division, although he outweighs Terutsuyoshi and his stablemate Enho who have made the top division subsequently.) He has also been known for his contributions on social media, posting video clips on Twitter of his fellow wrestlers playing arcade games and competing in sprint races. He is sponsored by McLaren Automotive, and on his 27th birthday he arrived at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in a sports car that they provided for him. Career Ishiura joined the Miyagino stable and entered professional sumo in 2013 at the relatively advanced age of 23. He made an immediate impact, winning the jonokuchi division in March and the jonidan division in May with unblemished 7-0 records and earning a third straight promotion with six wins at sandanme in July. As he worked his way up the ranks he served as a tsukebito or personal attendant to yokozuna Hakuh≈ç. He spent the next nine tournaments in the third makushita division before earning another promotion with a 6‚Äì1 record in January 2015. He was the first new sekitori from Tottori Prefecture since Kotozakura 52 years earlier. In the second division (j≈´ry≈ç) he proved himself a consistent performer, recording seven winning records (kachi-koshi) in ten tournaments and clinching yet another promotion with nine wins in September 2016. Ishiura made his makuuchi debut in November, 2016 debuting at East Maegashira 15. After losing on the first day of the tournament to Chiyotairyu Ishiura won the next ten days straight putting him on the leader board for a while. However, on day 12 Ishiura suffered his second loss to Ikioi and then continued to lose for the rest of the tournament finishing off with a 10‚Äì5 record which was enough to win him his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit. In his debut tournament he was able to get ten straight victories, double digit wins, and his first special prize. His ten wins equaled the performance of Sh≈çdai in January 2016 and was otherwise the best by a top-division debutante since Ichinojo's thirteen wins in September 2014. In the January 2017 tournament Ishiura at Maegashira 9 (his highest rank to date) was only able to secure a 6‚Äì9 record. The March 2017 tournament saw him at maegashira 11, and he had mixed results. On the final day his record was 7‚Äì7, however he was unable to get the win against Takarafuji and end the tournament with a losing record of 7‚Äì8. He won only three bouts at maegashira 10 in the September 2017 tournament and was demoted back to the j≈´ry≈ç division, but an 8‚Äì7 record at the rank of West J≈´ry≈ç 1 in November 2017 was sufficient to return him to makuuchi. Ishiura remained in the top division for the next five tournaments, but after four straight losing records was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç again after the September 2018 tournament. After a two tournament stint in j≈´ry≈ç he returned to the top division in March 2019. He dropped to j≈´ry≈ç in July, but is ranked in makuuchi for September 2019. This was the first tournament that he and his stablemates Hakuh≈ç and Enh≈ç were all fit and in makuuchi together, allowing them all to take part in the yokozuna dohyo-iri ceremony. In training at his stable before the January 2020 tournament he came to blows with a junior ranked wrestler, Hokah≈ç, after a series of heated bouts and the pair had to be separated by Hakuh≈ç. The incident was reported to the Sumo Association by Miyagino Oyakata, and Ishiura was docked 20 percent of one month's salary. He missed the start of the September 2020 tournament due to a right ankle injury suffered on Day 14 of the July tournament, but returned from Day 8. Fighting style Ishiura favours a right hand inside, left hand outside grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt. His favourite kimarite or winning technique is shitatenage, the underarm throw. In November 2019, Ishiura won a victory in the Fukuoka Tournament ('Basho') over Nishikigi on Day Eight using what is likely the rarest winning technique in sumo. The mitokorozeme (‰∏âÊâÄÊîª„ÇÅ) or 'three places attack' is a kimarite that had not been seen in the top division since Mainoumi used it in 1993. Personal life Ishiura announced in May 2017 that he had married a nursery school teacher in April after a four year relationship. The wedding ceremony was held in October 2017 with his stablemate Hakuh≈ç among the 500 guests. Their first child was born in May 2018.

Biography Lee Konstantinou was born in New York City. Konstantinou received his Bachelor of Arts in English, Psychology, and College Scholar from Cornell University. His bachelors thesis was titled ‚ÄúComics and the Holocaust: A(n) (Auto/bio)graphical Analysis of Art Spiegelman‚Äôs Maus,‚Äù about Art Spiegelman's Maus. Konstantinou then went on to receive his MA and PhD from Stanford University in 2009 with a dissertation titled ‚ÄúWipe That Smirk off Your Face: Postironic Literature and the Politics of Character.‚Äù Since 2012, Konstantinou has been an assistant professor of English Literature at University of Maryland, College Park. Fiction Konstantinou wrote Pop Apocalypse: A Possible Satire, which was published in 2009 by Ecco/Harper Perennial. The novel details a future in which \\"California is an occupied territory, the United Nations is for poor countries, and America‚Äôs president is named Friendly, but the media-obsessed, personal-computer-equipped denizens[...] are blissfully unconcerned about the brink of armageddon.\\"Wernecke, Ellen. \\"Lee Konstantinou: Pop Apocalypse\\". The A.V. Club. In a review for The A.V. Club, Ellen Wernecke awarded the novel a \\"B,\\" noting, \\"Pop Apocalypse buzzes with biblical references (the giant neon halo over the Omni Science headquarters is the most obvious) and constant reminders of the end times, but that isn‚Äôt necessarily bad: The occasionally overwrought imagery is useful for organizing the technology and history of this Department Of Homeland Security-meets- YouTube world[....]The process of building that world is initially a distraction from Eliot‚Äôs cringe-inducing metamorphosis from rich party kid to concerned citizen, but the details of his known universe are just close enough to terror fantasies and current corporate skullduggery as to be riveting.\\"Ibid. Publishers Weekly presented another positive look at the novel, writing, \\"This playful and witty novel takes our celebrity-obsessed and media-hijacked culture, mixes in geopolitics and a dash of cyberpunk dystopia to create an intelligent and blistering what-if.\\"\\"Pop Apocalypse\\". Publishers Weekly. Margaret Wappler of the Los Angeles Times offered a more mixed review of the novel, stating, \\"His best skill is his imagination. The book is so breathless with concepts that the prose too often serves merely as a delivery device and his characters suffer.\\"Wappler, Margaret. \\"'Pop Apocalypse' by Lee Konstantinou\\". Los Angeles Times. Non-Fiction In 2012, Konstantinou co- edited The Legacy of David Foster Wallace with University of Missouri professor Samuel Cohen. The collection discusses American author David Foster Wallace's legacy following his death in 2008 and includes pieces by other American writers such as Don DeLillo, George Saunders, Dave Eggers and Jonathan Franzen as well as other figures in Wallace's life, such as his editor, Michael Pietsch. The collection also includes a chapter by Konstantinou, titled \\"No Bull: David Foster Wallace and Postironic Belief,\\" which would later be included in Konstantinou's 2016 book Cool Characters: Irony and American Fiction. In the piece, Konstantinou discusses Wallace's fiction, especially his 1996 novel Infinite Jest, his 1993 essay, \\"E Pluribus Unum,\\" and Wallace's desire for \\"a viable postironic ethos for U.S. literature and culture at the End of History\\"Cohen, Samuel and Lee Konstantinou, editors. The Legacy of David Foster Wallace. University of Iowa Press, 2012. p. 84-5. In his 2016 book, Cool Characters: Irony and American Fiction, Konstantinou expands on the idea of postironic literature. The book first details the \\"political history of irony\\" in American fiction, which Konstantinou contends \\"Wallace misread\\" as having an \\"unambiguously critical mission at midcentury,\\" instead offering that \\"irony offered a vision of political freedom troublingly imbricated with Cold War liberalism.\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. xii. In the introduction, Konstantinou examines the character of irony, first noting the ambivalence of postmodern authors such as Wallace or Zadie Smith about irony and other features of postmodernism. He contends that the most important goal for writers seeking to move beyond postmodernism is transcending irony, though these writers don't have any illusions about returning to a pre-postmodern world. He details four types of political irony: the cognitive, the antifoundational, the historicist, and the characterological. The cognitive form of political irony \\"sees its political power as arising from its status as a speech act.\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 10. In Konstantinou's view, the characterological form of irony is the most effective. He contends that the debate over the use and history of irony is characterological, as \\"[w]hether they are concerned with irony's cognitive, epistemic, or historical dimensions, those who argue about irony use a rich language of character, attitude, sensibility, disposition, and ethos\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 15. Konstantinou also discusses the movement of New Sincerity in his introduction, arguing that it is \\"closest in spirit to postirony,\\" but its \\"focus on sincerity too narrowly maps the contemporary literary field[....]Why, after all, would sincerity be the aspired state one might want to attain if one was concerned about irony? Why not commitment, or passion, or emotion, or decision?\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 38. He also notes, \\"[m]ore importantly, [Adam] Kelly's focus on the 'ethical' accounts for only a narrow sector of contemporary efforts to move beyond the postmodern,\\" as movements beyond postmodernism should not only address \\"questions of traditional ethical or moral concern but also a broader universe of mental training, including political life, of which the ethical aspiration to sincerity is indeed one important dimension\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 39. Konstantinou examines figures of American life, the hipster and the punk, and their relation to irony. He contends that \\"by studying the hipster, the Ur-ironist of postwar life - a character type many artists and intellectuals thought was best adapted to the age of abundance - we can reconstruct the foundations of our contemporary picture of irony and, in doing so, revise many deeply ingrained assumptions about its subversive power\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 51. He then traces the concept of \\"hipness\\" through American history, beginning in 1938 with Cab Calloway and jive and moving through authors such as Ralph Ellison and Thomas Pynchon. Konstantinou concludes the chapter by contending that \\"the quest for hip became a branch of a more general postwar quest for criticality as such, which was neither at odds with the liberal 'status quo' nor just another form of positivism[...]Hipness became a characterological weapon in an intellectual conflict that pitted increasingly stale critical institutions against newer forms of knowingness, newer places outside of society that were, simultaneously, inside emerging subcultural groups or coteries that claimed to occupy advantageous epistemic vantage points on American life. We must conclude that the hipster - who signaled his exclusive knowledge through irony - lived in accord with the dominant spirit of the Age of Criticism\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. .102. In his next chapter, \\"Punk's Positive Dystopia,\\" he labels the punk in the 1970s as a \\"frustrated agent within the specific contradictions that marked the boundary between the midcentury welfare state[...]and a still-inchoate (at least at the level of public policy) neoliberalism\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 105. Konstantinou notes that the punk sought Do it yourself or DIY culture as a solution to the era in which they existed. He contends that the punk's use of irony, seen in works by authors such as William S. Burroughs and Kathy Acker, is \\"positive dystopia,\\" an \\"ironic narrative mode that finds the conditions for survival in destruction\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 106. He differentiates the punk from the hipster, noting, \\"Punk escalates the critical irony of the hipster. Whereas the hipster used irony to draw attention to the polysemy of language, to manipulate language in pursuit of what he saw as human freedom, the punk uses linguistic polysemy in an effort to stop or arrest language itself.\\" Konstantinou then examines punk's connection to irony through its resistance to \\"selling out\\" and how this resistance became co-opted, Burroughs' writing, and contemporary punk and its usage of \\"temporary autonomous zones\\" or TAZs. The second half of Cool Characters analyzes postirony, looking at \\"the believer,\\" the \\"coolhunter,\\" and members of the Occupy Wall Street movement. In the chapter \\"How to Be a Believer,\\" Konstantinou discusses David Foster Wallace and Dave Eggers' attempts to construct a feasible postironic movement. He notes that \\"[f]or Wallace, postironic belief underwrites the possibility of genuine communication\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 168. He contends that Wallace's attempts to construct an ethos centered around belief differs from one tied to religion like seen in the series Left Behind, as \\"Wallace wants to invent a new form of secular belief, a religious vocabulary (God, prayer) that is emptied out of any specific content and is engineered to confront the possibly insuperable condition of postmodernity\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 170. Konstantinou argues that like Wallace, Eggers \\"means to make his readers into believers. Eggers has asked his readers to believe in him, in the truthfulness of his memoir, the sincerity of his various enterprises\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 198. Konstantinou concludes that while \\"Wallace's brand of postirony, for all its power, was more concerned with overthrowing the rule of a particular type of person, the ironist, than with changing the institutional relations that facilitated the rise to this type[....]Because he did not focus on transforming postmodern institutions, Wallace may have been doomed to fail to achieve his aims in strictly literal terms\\" Eggers \\"by contrast, seems to have understood the importance of constructing alternative institutions\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 215. He lauds Eggers (and the institutions he has created, such as McSweeney's) for \\"creat[ing] a relatively optimistic ethos of belief that mixes a quirky aesthetic sensibility with an urge toward philanthropy and the active construction of alternative institutional structures\\" In his next chapter, Konstantinou examines the \\"coolhunter,\\" a figure that seeks out \\"cool\\" cultural items for use by corporations and other capitalist institutions. He discusses the use of this figure in fiction, such as in Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad, where Egan envisions \\"a near future in which the advanced understanding and manipulation of the cool leads to the rise of a postironic youth culture\\" 'Konstantinou 2016, p. 219. He contends that \\"[a]fter all, Egan seems to show, new forms of authentic experience can still emerge unexpectedly even in a world whose social life is fully enclosed within corporate platforms\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 266. Konstantinou concludes the chapter by asserting that \\"[t]he lesson the coolhunter teachers is that such sensitivity requires, at a minimum, both a critically distant and aesthetically invested sense of the market and the world\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 270. In his conclusion, Konstantinou discusses the Occupy movement. Examining a controversy in the movement in which a group attempting to sell a print of an iconic image related to the movement, he notes, \\"[t]hough seemingly minor, this controversy showcases the political paradoxes of Occupy, illuminating how difficult it can be to differentiate 'speaking with' from 'speaking for' within the context of Occupy's style of anarchist politics\\" and contends \\"[t]he characterological question Occupy raised was nothing less than what form our collective subjectivity should take.\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 272. He also combats the \\"[c]ondemnations of the contemporary hipster,\\" writing that the view taken by critics in which the mid-century hipster and other iconoclast figures were entirely authentic and oppositional is \\"an idealized past[...][s]tories about the dire need to move beyond contemporary hipster irony, toward some new form of oppositional political sincerity, are written in a narrative genre that I will call the postironic Bildungsroman\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 275. Konstantinou concludes the book by arguing that irony is \\"always political,\\" but \\"does not have a predetermined fate or political content\\": \\"As my discussions of the hipster and the punk have tried to show, irony did not, even at its most avowedly countercultural forms, necessarily aid projects of human liberation. Nor, as my discussions of the believer and the coolhunter sought to demonstrate, will we be able to predict in advance the future political significance of postirony.\\" Instead, he offers, \\"[w]e must, therefore, cultivate within ourselves an ironic understanding of our own countercultural inheritance while simultaneously developing a nonironic commitment to learning how to build enduring institutions that have the capacity not only to rouse spirits but also to dismantle the power of those whose strength partly depends on our cynicism\\"Konstantinou 2016, p. 288. In a review of Cool Characters for Times Higher Education, Robert Eaglestone praises the book. He argues, \\"All of these analyses are complex and detailed, led by a deep engagement with literary texts, their cultural surroundings, and are astutely theoretically informed.\\"Eaglestone, Robert. \\"Cool Characters: Irony and American Fiction, by Lee Konstantinou\\". Times Higher Education. Eaglestone labels the book \\"another insightful, provocative and necessary book in literary studies from Harvard University Press.\\"< In a recent publication from The Chronicle of Higher Education, Konstantinou responds to Rita Felski‚Äôs remarks on the dependency of literary scholars on critique: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs actually quite a diverse range of intellectual frameworks, politically, theoretically, philosophically, yet there‚Äôs an underlying similarity in terms of this mood of vigilance, wariness, suspicion, distrust, which doesn‚Äôt really allow us to grapple with these really basic questions about why people actually take up books in the first place, why they matter to people.‚ÄùPerry, Marc. \\"What's Wrong With Literary Studies?\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education. Felski emphasizes the need to move past critique and the Danish National Research Foundation has awarded her $4.2 million to a study lead by Felski ‚Äúto investigate the social uses of literature.‚Äù However, Konstantinou has rebuked her claims. In his opinion, ‚ÄúLiterary critics are not handcuffed to the project of critique‚Äù and as he did his research, put a premium on visiting archives and documenting the past. Konstantinou has also written for Slate (magazine). In a recent publication there, Konstantinou writes about the phenomenon of the Unmanned aerial vehicle, or more colloquially known as the drone, in combination with Adult Swim‚Äôs Infomercials (TV series) short, ‚Äò‚ÄôFartcopter‚Äô‚Äô. Konstantinou explains that this fake informercial aims at selling a product, namely ‚Äúa small yellow helicopter‚Äîa drone‚Äîwith a speaker hanging from its underside. The drone does one thing and does it well: It makes obnoxious fart noises‚Äô.Konstantinou, Lee ‚Äú‚ÄòFartcopter‚Äô Has the Answer‚Äù. Slate Fartcopter is sold to violent children, to distract them from being violent to other children. The eleven minute infomercial also tells the story of Michael, a boy who loves to terrorize children with his fartcopter. However, one day his family stages an intervention and each one of them uses a fartcopter for the last time. After it farts, the fartcopters report that they are ‚Äúout of farts.‚Äù Michael is finally freed of his addiction and murders his family. Konstantinou is of the opinion that Fartcopter can teach us about our relationship with drones. The weapon turned toy ‚Äúcan use weaponized farts to murder America‚Äôs many enemies, the general explains‚Äîat birthday parties, graduations, funerals, yacht launches, dog adoption fairs, quincea√±eras, and so on.‚Äù Fartcopter makes it clear that the whole world is a battlefield. Furthermore, Konstantinou sees the short infomercial as making a critique of the global war on terrorism. Now a remote person can wage war from across the globe. Detached from the experience and reality of warfare, piloting a drone becomes reminiscent to playing a video game. Furthermore, Konstantinou sees something uncanny in the drones, namely that ‚Äúthe human agency behind them is, by design, ambiguous.‚Äù. The viewer or even victim of the drone does not know if they are being attacked by a human or a robot. Bibliography =Books= * Cool Characters: Irony and American Fiction.

The work combines appreciation for classical and Old Master painting and drawing with contemporary subjects. Peel was Professor Emerita at California College of the Arts where she taught for forty six years. Early life and education Peel (n√©e Carole Lee Doyle) was born in 1934 in Los Angeles, California. She grew up in south central Los Angeles during the Depression, where she had broad access to educational enrichment. Peel cites her deepest influences as being ‚Äú...from my mother and Rembrandt and, at fourteen, Kathe Kollwitz. I fell in love with Rembrandt in the Los Angeles County Museum and at seven or eight wanted to be just like him.‚Äù She attended Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, where she was inspired with a passion for draftsmanship and a desire to teach by an art teacher, who recognized her talent and encouraged her to study. Beginning at age 16, Peel attended summer sessions at Chouinard Art Institute, University of California Los Angeles, Manual Arts, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. She received her B.S. Degree from University of Utah in 1958, and went on to study at √âcole sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and University of Geneva, Switzerland. She received her M.A. in Art from the University of California Berkeley in 1964 and was particularly influenced by Professors Erle Loran (1905‚Äì1999) and Robert Hartman (1926‚Äì2015).  Teaching career  From 1964 to 1966 Peel taught at the Department of Art at the University of California, Berkeley, where she was recipient of the Anne Bremer Award. In 1968 she was appointed Associate Professor, California College of the Arts (CCA), where she taught until 2014.California College of the Arts, Faculty Directory According to her colleague and former Painting Department Chair Kim Anno: ‚ÄúCarole Peel brought serious dedication to teaching the practice of portraiture at California College of the Arts. Her approach was through refined hands-on skills and the telling of travel stories. Peel travelled to Europe extensively and gathered stories of the European masters, sharing these vividly with students. Up until her retirement at 80, her classes were filled to capacity with young fascinated minds.‚ÄùKim Anno, Personal Interview by Dr. Alla Efimova, November 28, 2016  Work  During Peel's career she has created work in diverse media including drawings in graphite and colored pencil, watercolor and gouache, as well as mixed media collages and paintings. Peel's mastery of portraiture and still life has led her to sometimes blur boundaries between the two. In some cases, such as Portrait of Bellini, 1989, Morandi and Chardin, 1990, and Group Portrait (Portrait of Goblets), 1993, she names still life drawings as portraits. Many of her still life drawings are tributes to Old Master painters, such as Giovanni Bellini, Duccio, Pisanello, Jean Clouet, Diego Velazquez, and Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, among others. Since 1980, Peel made annual trips to London and Paris, where she drew in museums, most often at the British Museum. Her oeuvre also includes numerous commissioned and self- portraits. ‚ÄúHer delicate work is personal, becoming postmodern in the later years. She takes apart her favorite masterworks and intervenes with small hermetic gestures of still life, integrating social commentary with everyday life. For decades, Peel drew portraits of the intellectuals and their families around her, creating a visual archive of the history of the Bay Area,‚Äù said Kim Anno.Anno, interview. Peel's work has been featured in numerous group exhibitions at colleges including Lone Mountain College, Scripps College, St. Mary's College, and San Jose State University, as well as at Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art (LAICA), San Francisco Center for the Book, California Crafts Museum, and Berkeley Art Center.

This is in contrast to the Presidential Protective Division whose mission is to shield the president from an attack and to evacuate the president to a place of safety. The CAT can also provide tactical support to other designated protectees, at venues and National Special Security Events. The Secret Service first began fielding counter assault teams in 1979. \\"Hawkeye\\" is the designation for a CAT assigned to the president, followed by the president's Secret Service code name. For example, the code name for President Obama's CAT was \\"Hawkeye Renegade\\". History Prior to 1979, Secret Service vehicle convoys for VIPs in high- risk situations included a large sedan known as the \\"muscle car\\" in which five or six Secret Service special agents armed with sub-machine guns rode. The \\"muscle car\\" team was an ad hoc contingent drawn from special agents working at a local Secret Service office, as opposed to those regularly assigned to protective duties. They were instructed, in the event of an attack against the convoy, to lay-down a barrage of suppressive fire against the source of the attack so as to allow the dignitary's vehicle the opportunity to escape without being pursued or blockaded. In 1979 the Secret Service formalized the counter-assault team program with permanently assigned, specially trained operators. Counter Assault Team member training at the Rowley Training Center in 2018 =Hawkeye= Following the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, a CAT that came to be designated \\"Hawkeye\\" was assigned to full-time presidential escort duty. According to Dan Bongino, Hawkeye has never responded to an actual armed attack. Special agents assigned to Hawkeye were implicated in the Summit of the Americas prostitution scandal in 2012. Operations =Selection and training= Members of the counter assault team are Secret Service special agents who have completed an initial, eight- month course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, and have successfully served at least several years in the Secret Service. Upon selection, CAT operators undergo an additional seven weeks of specialized training that includes counter-ambush tactics and close quarters combat. Applications for the team are competitive and physical requirements for entry include three pull-ups wearing a weighted vest and a run in under nine minutes. Approximately ten percent of applicants are ultimately selected. A motorcade during the presidency of George W. Bush with the Counter Assault Team in the vehicle in bottom right =Equipment= Typically, CAT members deploy in black battle dress uniforms. Each member not otherwise assigned a heavier weapon, is equipped with a SR-16 rifle, a SIG Sauer P229 pistol, and flash-bang grenades. =Duties= CAT operates both as part of motorcades and at fixed sites. In the event a VIP, the VIP's vehicle, or a protected site is attacked by multiple assailants, CAT is responsible for engaging and diverting the attackers, thereby buying the close protection shift time to evacuate the dignitary to a safe area. Hawkeye, when operating as part of a U.S. president's motorcade, travels in a vehicle several car lengths behind the presidential state car.

Retrieved 2016-11-28.  Redesign  In May 2018, NOAA announced that the recently launched GOES-17 satellite was suffering from a severe malfunction in its instrument cooling system, which resulted in degraded performance of its infrared sensors. The cause of the problem was determined to be with the loop heat pipe (LHP), which transports heat from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) to a radiator for rejection into space. Since the LHP design was shared among all four GOES-R series satellites, a redesign was required to prevent the anomaly from happening again on GOES-T and -U. Lockheed Martin had already completed assembly of GOES-T, and had to remove the ABI instrument in October 2018 and ship it to its manufacturer, Harris Corporation, to be rebuilt.  Launch  The satellite was originally planned to launch in May 2020 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, United States. Because of the repairs to correct the loop heat pipe problem, the deployment of GOES-T will be delayed. As of May 2019, the launch date is scheduled for December 2021.

It was the garment of priests and traditional Christians. It is called \\"Spanish\\" or even \\"Pa√±osa,\\" being made of cloth, wide flight and with bands of velvet lining revealing colour at the front edges.  History  The cloak is thought to originate from the \\"Sagun\\", a garment worn by the Celtiberians. Much later the cloak was banned by one of the ministers of Carlos III, triggering the start of the Esquilache riots in the eighteenth century. Richard Ford, in 1845, wrote that the cloak \\"favours habits of inactivity, prevents the over-zealous arms or elbows from doing anything, conceals a knife and rags, and, when muffled around, offers a disguise for intrigues and robbery\\", and that this is why it was banned. The first cloaks of the nineteenth century came from some of the wool-producing areas such as B√©jar in Salamanca. It is for this reason that one of its early precursors corresponds to the Duke of B√©jar. Royal Purveyor of Spanish cloaks in Madrid In the nineteenth century the cloak became very popular and thought of as elegant and stylish. Its use decreased around 1900. The journalist Antonio Velasco Zazo founded in Madrid the Association Cloak (called \\"The Cloak\\") in 1928, which was devoted entirely to encouraging the Spanish cloak as part of the popular apparel in Madrid. Zazo frequently wore the \\"castizo Spanish coat\\", whilst still wearing a hat, a custom among intellectuals. Although the association emerged in Madrid, it was something also typical in the history of Spain, and its prevalence existed in many cities.  Features  The cloak is long, open at the front and sleeveless. It was originally worn by men; models for women began to exist at the end of the 20th century. The most common colours for the cloak are black, navy blue and brown. It typically includes a fibula (generally similar to those of forms charro button).. It is often made of 100% sheep's wool, or 90% wool and 10% cashmere. In the present day it typically includes some amount of polyamide tissue. The emboli, the part that covers the face, is almost always 100% cotton velvet and is dyed in different colours: red, maroon, green.

In the year 2013, it has been inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. While deciding on the inscription, the Intergovernmental Committee noted that \\"Zhusuan is considered by Chinese people as a cultural symbol of their identity as well as a practical tool; transmitted from generation to generation, it is a calculating technique adapted to multiple aspects of daily life, serving multiform socio-cultural functions and offering the world an alternative knowledge system.\\" The movement to get Chinese Zhusuan inscribed in the list was spearheaded by Chinese Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Association. History Zhusuan was invented in China at the end of the 2nd century CE and reached its peak during the period from the 13th to the 16th century CE. In the 13th century, Guo Shoujing (ÈÉ≠ÂÆàÊï¨) used Zhusuan to calculate the length of each orbital year and found it to be 365.2425 days. In the 16th century, Zhu Zaiyu (Êú±ËºâÂ†â) calculated the musical Twelve-interval Equal Temperament using Zhusuan. And again in the 16th century, Wang Wensu (ÁéãÊñáÁ¥†) and Cheng Dawei (Á®ãÂ§ß‰Ωç) wrote respectively Principles of Algorithms and General Rules of Calculation, summarizing and refining the mathematical algorithms of Zhusuan, thus further boosting the popularity and promotion of Zhusuan. At the end of the 16th century, Zhusuan was introduced to neighboring countries and regions. In culture Zhusuan is an important part of the traditional Chinese culture. Zhusuan has a far- reaching effect on various fields of Chinese society, like Chinese folk custom, language, literature, sculpture, architecture, etc., creating a Zhusuan-related cultural phenomenon. For example, ‚ÄòIron Abacus‚Äô (ÈêµÁÆóÁõ§) refers to someone good at calculating; ‚ÄòPlus three equals plus five and minus two‚Äô (‰∏â‰∏ã‰∫îÈô§‰∫å; +3 = +5 ‚àí 2) means quick and decisive; ‚Äò3 times 7 equals 21‚Äô indicates quick and rash; and in some places of China, there is a custom of telling children's fortune by placing various daily necessities before them on their first birthday and letting them choose one to predict their future lives. Among the items is an abacus, which symbolizes wisdom and wealth.

The Tidewater and Western Railroad included a bridge over Swift Creek that had been built by an earlier railroad company, the Clover Hill Railroad. The bridge was used during the whole time the four railroad companies operated rails over the bridge. The metal on the bridge was sold as part of foreclosure of the final company in 1917. Geography and settings The Swift Creek Rail Bridge in Chesterfield County crossed Swift Creek, one of the two major creeks in the County. The Bridge crossed the creek, east of Carver Heights Drive, Chester, past a landfill and behind a housing complex west of Bright Hope Road, which is near Beach Road. The creek is narrow, because this point is west, upstream, of the fall line and the creek is not tidal here. Architecture Eastern Abutment of the Bright Hope Railroad Bridge over Swift Creek The remains of the bridge are granite abutments that are twenty feet wide indicating that it was a Truss Bridge. The bridge was one thirty foot span. The abutments were made of granite that was mined using star drills as shown by the drill holes. The Petersburg granite is readily available in the area. History The Swift Creek Rail Bridge was owned by four railroads. =Clover Hill Railroad= The bridge was constructed for the Clover Hill Railroad and Mining Company to get coal trains over Swift Creek in 1841. The tracks were standard gauge at that time. The State of Virginia declared this bridge sound in 1878. =Brighthope Railway= The Brighthope Railway bought the Clover Hill in bankruptcy and became the new owners of the bridge in 1877. The new owners increased passenger travel. In, 1881, the Brighthope owners converted the gauge to narrow gauge. =Farmville and Powhatan Railroad= The Farmville and Powhatan Railroad became the new owners in 1884. The Farmville and Powhatan allowed a telegraph to be added to the rails, which would have had a powered telegraph line across the bridge. =Tidewater and Western Railroad= The Tidewater and Western Railroad bought the bankrupt Farmville and Powhatan in 1905 and went bankrupt themselves in 1917. Creditors sold the rails and other assets to the World War One Effort in France. Only the granite abutments remain today. Another bridge takes Beach Road across Swift Creek. A residential road named Bright Hope is nearby.

This can happen due to many reasons which may include obstruction from primary teeth, bone surrounding the unerupted tooth or other mechanical factors. The two types of failure of eruption are primary failure of eruption and mechanical failure of eruption. Primary failure of eruption has been known to be associated with Parathyroid hormone 1 receptor mutation. Primary failure of eruption The term primary failure of eruption was named by William Proffit and Katherine Vig in 1981. This type of failure of eruption has a genetic or familial background precursor as a cause. The prevalence is of PFE is about 0.06% in population. In this type of failure, teeth that are non-ankylosed fail to erupt in the mouth. These teeth do not have a precursor tooth that is blocking their path. These teeth tend to erupt partially but then fail to erupt as the time goes on. Profitt stated that only the posterior teeth are the ones to be affected and all the teeth which are distal to the affected tooth are also affected. Both permanent and primary teeth may equally be affected. This often results in posterior open bite in patients mouth who have primary failure of eruption. This phenomenon can occur in any quadrant of the mouth. There are two types of primary failure of eruption. Type I involves failure of eruption of teeth distal to the most mesial affected tooth to be all same. Type II involves a greater eruption pattern, not complete, among the teeth distal to the most mesial affected tooth. It is difficult to diagnose between these two types of failure of eruption because 2nd molar does not erupt until a patient is 15 years of age. Plenty of times, patient's receive orthodontic care much before they turn 15 years old. Therefore, to properly diagnose between two types, a patient needs to be over 15 and a definitive proof of uneruption of 2nd molar is required. = Management = Management of teeth with PFE can include extractions of affected teeth, followed by orthodontic space closure or placement of a prosthetic implant with a bone graft. This option can only be applied to a single tooth that is affected. If multiple teeth are affected then, a segmental osteotomy may be performed to bring the entire segment into occlusion. However, minimal success has been shown following this procedure. These teeth usually are \\"non-responsive\\" to the orthodontic force and studies have shown that ankylosis of these teeth can occur if force applied. Mechanical failure of eruption This type of failure of eruption takes place when the affected tooth is ankylosed to the bone around it. This is different from primary failure of eruption where the affected tooth/teeth were not ankylosed. In mechanical failure of eruption, affected tooth has partial or complete loss of PDL in a panoramic radiograph and teeth distal to affected tooth do not have this condition. On a percussion test, a tooth with mechanical failure of eruption will have a dull metallic sound. Eruption failure related to syndrome There have been many syndromes which have been identified to be related to failure of eruption of teeth. These syndromes are Cleidocranial dyspalsia, Osteoporosis, Rutherford syndrome, GAPO syndrome and Osteoglophonic dysplasia.

Development The Praga NDO bus chassis was developed in late 1930s in Czechoslovakia. First buses manufactured by Praga in Brno were used since 1938, but the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 has forced a stop in the production. Simultaneous Switch to right- hand traffic in Czechoslovakia has also forced the re-work of all existing buses. The production was resumed by Karosa in 1947, with first bus appearing on route in Bratislava 3 December 1947. Other bus manufacturers in Czechoslovakia were shut down in 1948. By that time, the NDO bus chassis was thoroughly obsolete, but production of NDO bus has continued anyway due to urgent demand for mass transportation in rebuilt Czech cities. After building 50 buses in 1947-1948, the NDO bus was replaced on production lines with the ≈†koda 706 RO bus, which was superseded in time by ≈†koda 706 RTO bus. Construction The construction of the NDO bus was based on the Praga ND truck, with the forward-located engine and its cowling unchanged. The bus body was mostly made of metal, only the roof was made of wood and canvas. The bus maximal speed was . The maximal loaded weight of the bus was . The long-haul layout featured a four seats per row, with central aisle and forward door. Driver had a separate door to the driving compartment. The capacity of long- haul NDO buses was 42 passengers. The short-haul layout featured wider aisle with seats arranged along the bus walls facing aisle. The folding door was located in the center of the bus body. The short-haul layout had the 65 passengers capacity, with 27 seats. Also, a short-hail version with the two doors was made. The front door was still operated from the driver\`s compartment, while the rear door was operated by the conductor. Usage At least 50 NDO buses were used in Prague and 20 in Brno, some other buses were used in Bratislava. The buses were gradually retired from the municipal service in 1955-1958 being replaced by ≈†koda 706 RO, with at least one of the decommissioned buses were still on road in 1960s serving a club customers.

Yeats called her \\"the best paid woman journalist of her time\\", and Arnold Bennett called her the \\"most brilliant reviewer\\" in London. Early life Edith Shackleton Heald was born on 12 September 1885 in Manchester, the younger daughter of John Thomas Heald, and Mary Shackleton. They were both from Stacksteads, Lancashire, and he was originally a schoolmaster. She had an older sister, Nora Shackleton Heald, with whom she co-owned the Chantry House. Nora would go on to be the editor of The Queen and The Lady.

The museum opened in 2015 and has a collection of over 200 works. Location The museum is located at 190 Sunset Avenue in downtown Edmonds, adjacent to the town's ferry terminal and train station. It is located inside a former Safeway grocery store built in the 1960s, sharing the building with several shops and restaurants. Once slated for demolition and redevelopment, it was bought by the Echelbarger family in 2012 to be renovated and modernized for new tenants. The retrofit exposed the building's timber frame and added wood elements sourced from the Pacific Northwest as an expression of the region's eco- consciousness. History The idea of a museum for Pacific Northwest art was conceived by Lindsey Echelbarger during the acquisition of the Safeway building in 2012; Echelbarger had been collecting Northwest artists' work for decades prior. The museum opened on September 12, 2015, with an exhibit from the Northwest Watercolor Society. In its first year of operations, the museum hosted six main exhibitions and grew its membership to over 600. Collection and exhibits The museum's primary focus is on artwork from the Pacific Northwest from 1880 to 1962, either from artists from the area or related to local places and events. Pacific Northwest art from this period, especially the years prior to 1930, has been largely forgotten by museums and collectors according to art historians. The region's artwork, according to curator David F. Martin, differs from the rest of the United States because of influences from Native American and East Asian culture. The museum features five galleries, which are divided into annual and quarterly rotations, and over 200 works that it leases and borrows from other collections. The Cascadia Art Museum has featured works and exhibits from the Northwest Watercolor Society, Peggy Strong, Lance Wood Hart, and Northwest School artists John Matsudaira, Mark Tobey, and Morris Graves. The exhibits are curated by David Martin of the Martin-Zambito Fine Art gallery in Seattle.

Built in 1849, it originally contained high-end apartments for well- to-do members of the bourgeoisie but was converted into office space in the second half of the 20th century. It was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and in 1932. Danmarks Skibskredit A/S is now based in the building. History The site where building stands today was formerly part of the gardens of the neighboring Lindencrone Mansion. Adolph Christian Fibiger, a canvas manufacturer, acquired the mansion in 1840. He later commissioned Gustav Friedrich Hetsch to design the building at Sankt Ann√¶ Plads 1-3 with high-end apartments for well-to-do members of the bourgeoisie. Hetsch made the initial renderings in 1847 but was removed from the project after a dispute with Fibiger and the building was instead completed by Peter Christoph Hagemann to a slightly modified design in 1849. The building contained two apartments in the ground floor and a single apartment on the others floors. The civil servant George Joachim Quaade, who had previously had a residence at Amalienborg, lived briefly in one of the apartments in 1853 but moved to new home in a now demolished building at Bredgade 19 in 1854. In 1856 he became Department executive (departementschef= of the in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1860, he served as ambassador in first The Haque and later Brussels and Berlin. The jurist and politician Gustav Edvard Brock lived in the building from 1863. Royal Ballet Master August Bournonville lived at No. 3 in the mid-1870s. The building was altered in 1881. It was listed in 1932. The building was listed in 1932. It was adapted for use as offices in the post war period but restored in 1988. The facade was restored by Erik J√∏rgensens Tegnestue with assistance from Bo Kierkegaard in 1996. Architecture Elevation by Hetsch from 1847 One of the pavilions Designed in the Historicist style, the building consists of four storeys over a high cellar and is seven bays wide. It stands on a plinth of granite and is topped by a Half-hip slate roof. The building is flanked by two lower pavilions, each of which has a gateway in the ground floor, a loggia with columns on the first floor and a roof terrace with decorated parapet. A third floor with balcony which had been added in 1881 was removed uin the 1988 restoration. The facade of the building is dressed in a pale sand colour. A continuous meander frieze runs between the first and second storey of the buildings and the two pavilions and a blank, white frieze runs between the second and third floor. The nornice and window sills are supported by corbels. The book Danske Arkitekturstr√∏mninger 1850-1950 contains plan drawings and facade renderings of the building.

Early years Elwyn Seelye was born October 27, 1848 in Queensbury, Warren County, New York. His family was from New England and was prominent in the Indian wars of the New England Colonies. His great- grandfather, Nehemiah Seelye, was one of the patentees of Queensbury, and an officer in the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. Reuben Seelye, grandfather of Elwyn, was a lumberman, who cleared many farms, among which are some of the best known in Queensbury. Reuben Seelye, 2nd, holder of many local offices, was the father of Elwyn Seelye; Rizpah Matilda, daughter of Calvin Haskins, a physician who practiced in Queensbury, was his mother. Her maternal grandfather, Fields. was an officer at the Battle of Lexington. In 1864, before Seelye had reached his 16 birthday, he attempted to enlist as a Union soldier. After repeated rejection by officers who knew his father and his age, he went to Fort Ann and secured acceptance. He ran away from home to Albany and entered the 14th New York Heavy Artillery. His regiment reached the front just after the fall of Petersburg. While on duty in North Carolina, he was thrown from the top of a freight car and received an injury of the spine from which he never fully recovered. Career He returned from the war to his father‚Äôs Queensbury farm on the Bay Road, which he managed until some three years after his marriage. At a later period, he took building contracts at Lake George and dealt in real estate. In 1877, Seelye married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward Eggleston, the author. They lived at Dunham‚Äôs Bay from 1881 to 1895 throughout the year and passed the winters of 1895-98 in the village of Caldwell. During that time, Seelye became deeply interested in the marking and preservation of the site of the Battle of Lake George. After the purchase of the battle ground by the State, he became its first custodian. Ill health at last compelled his resignation. As a charter member of the New York State Historical Association, he was one of its stanchest supporters. The ‚ÄúReport of Secretary‚Äù in Volume I of the annuals of the New York State Historical Association opens with the following statement: ‚ÄúIt may not be uninteresting to review in a few words the origin of this organization. In the summer of 1898, Seelye called a few gentlemen together at the Fort William Henry Hotel to consider the formation of an historical society. The project was well received, other meetings were held, the scope of the movement enlarged, and a State society determined upon.‚Äù Personal life In the fall of 1898, Seelye began to reside in Ithaca during term time to secure the advantages of a university town for his children. He was a member of the Town and Gown Club and was one of a congenial coterie self-named the ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs Club\\". He continued to reside in Ithaca during term time until June 1909, when he returned to Dunham's Bay. After 1910, he spent his winters at New York and elsewhere and his summers at Dunham‚Äôs Bay. Seelye died at Hastings-on-Hudson, October 14, 1920. He was the father of six children: Allegra (b. 1878), Blanche (b. 1882), Elwyn (b. 1884), Edward (b. 1888), Cynthia (b. 1888) and Elizabeth (b. 1893). His wife and four of them survived him.

Male of Prolepsis lucifer photographed in Reserva Natural Parque San Martin, Cordoba, Argentina Description Medium-sized robber flies (14‚Äì25 mm) with antennae that have a relatively long third article. Abdomen is rather plump compared to many other asilids. Wings usually extending past the abdomen and often tinted or pigmented along most of their length. Coloration predominantly black to brown or reddish; often mimicking spider wasps. The two sexes can have distinctly different colors. Ventral side of the femur of the middle leg pair often with a thick patch of short and stout spines. Long third article of the antennae in Prolepsis lucifer. In Prolepsis species it is typically 2 to 3 times longer than the first and second articles combined. The yellow arrow points at the ventral patch of thick bristles on the middle femur in a male Prolepsis lucifer from San Martin. Many Prolepsis species have a similar feature. Biology As is typical for robber flies, adults of Prolepsis species are ambush predators, taking off from a resting position on the ground or on branches to intercept other flying insects in mid-air.

A suture is used to emulate the action of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle and position the paralyzed vocal cord closer to the midline. This allows the two vocal cords to meet and can improve speaking and swallowing ability for affected patients. Arytenoid adduction is often performed in conjunction with medialization thyroplasty.  Vocal Cord Paralysis  One of the key functions of the larynx is phonation, the production of sound. Phonation requires the vocal cords to be adducted (positioned towards the midline) so that they can meet and vibrate together as air is expelled between them. Physiologically, the glottis is closed by intrinsic laryngeal muscles such as the lateral cricoarytenoid, thyroarytenoid, and interarytenoid muscles. These muscles act on the arytenoid cartilages at the posterior ends of the vocal cords and are innervated by the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves. Damage to these nerves results in vocal cord paralysis - the reduced mobility and inability to adduct one or both vocal cords. Many cases of vocal cord paralysis result from trauma during surgery. Symptoms include hoarseness of voice, difficulty projecting, difficulty swallowing, and throat pain. The arytenoid adduction procedure alleviates these symptoms by manually positioning the paralyzed vocal cord towards the midline. This is accomplished by passing a suture between the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage and the thyroid cartilage. This rotates the arytenoid cartilage and adducts the vocal cord.  Procedure  Diagram of arytenoid adduction procedure, lateral view. * Local anesthesia is preferred for arytenoid adduction so that the voice can be tested during the procedure. * A horizontal skin incision is made at the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage. * A window is cut in the thyroid cartilage for a suture to be passed through later in the procedure. * The strap muscles, pharynx, and larynx are dissected to expose the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. * A permanent suture is passed through the muscular process. * A tunnel is made in the thyroid cartilage and one end of the suture is passed through it. * The suture is tied and secured to the window made in the thyroid cartilage. * The vocal cords are observed endoscopically to ensure proper rotation of the arytenoid. * The patient is asked to phonate to evaluate voice quality and the potential need for a concurrent thyroplasty.  Indications  Options for surgical treatment of vocal cord paralysis include vocal cord injection, medialization thyroplasty, and arytenoid adduction. Each of these techniques results in medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord. However, arytenoid adduction is preferred in cases where there is a large posterior glottal gap or vertical misalignment between the vocal folds. Arytenoid adduction is often performed at the same time as a medialization thyroplasty. Animal model studies suggest that combining the two procedures produces better outcomes than when performing either alone. = Posterior glottal gap = The paralyzed vocal cord may rest close to or far from the midline. An extremely laterally positioned vocal cord can result in a large posterior glottal gap - an opening between the two vocal cords even when the functioning vocal cord is fully medialized. Vocal cord injection is ineffective for closing a large glottal gap. Arytenoid adduction is more effective than medialization thyroplasty for closing a posterior gap. It has been suggested that this is because arytenoid adduction directly rotates the arytenoid cartilage and thus more actively medializes the posterior aspect of the vocal cord. = Vertical glottal gap = The paralyzed vocal cord may rest on a different plane than the opposite vocal cord. This results in a vertical gap between the two vocal cords that cannot be resolved using vocal cord injection or medialization thryoplasty. The suture placed in the arytenoid adduction procedure mimics the action of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle and pulls the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage medially and inferiorly. Thus arytenoid adduction can correct the vertical position of an elevated vocal cord.  Outcomes  Arytenoid adduction with or without medialization thyroplasty significantly improves quality of life for patients with vocal cord paralysis. Subjective outcome measures of voice quality include the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain (GBRAS) voice scale, Voice Handicap Index, and closure of the glottic gap. Objective outcome measures include mean and maximum phonation time, phonotory airflow, and signal-to-noise ratio. Arytenoid adduction produces improvements in all of these parameters.  Disadvantages and Complications  Arytenoid adduction is more technically challenging than either vocal cord injection or medialization thyroplasty and has a high learning curve. Increased incidence of complications have been reported for arytenoid adduction compared to medialization thyroplasty. Potential complications include: * Wound infection * Edema * Hematoma * Vocal cord spasms Intubation and/or tracheotomy may be required as a result of these complications.

It demonstrated the last true offensive operation of the Iraqi Air Force before grounding their air assets in an attempt to preserve them for future use. Through careful planning and coordination, two MiG-25 jets successfully caught two American F-15 fighters off guard and engaged them in a dogfight. After several minutes of aerial maneuvering, and several fired missiles, the Iraqi jets returned to Tammuz Air Force Base undamaged, and the F-15s returned to Saudi Arabia, albeit with one damaged. Prelude By 19 January it had become apparent to Iraqi leadership that they could not engage the coalition air forces openly. Saddam Hussein had ordered most of his air assets to be conserved inside of bunkers in an attempt to save them for future use against the coalition. Consequently, Coalition sorties began targeting aircraft hangars and shelters to destroy the Iraqi Air Force on the ground. Between 17 and 27 January, 117 Iraqi aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Saddam ordered his air force to evacuate their aircraft to Iran temporarily, to be used in future sorties (Iran instead interned the aircraft). Flying in flights of four, Iraqi military aircraft retreated east across the country routed through Baghdad airspace due to its heavy air defenses. To counter this, the US Air Force established a \\"wall\\" of F-15s along the Iranian border to shoot down any aircraft attempting to flee. In order to facilitate the retreat of its air force, Iraq sought to shoot down these patrolling F-15s. Plan Planning for Operation Samurra had begun as early as 18 January, when the Iraqi Air Force was bolstered by a successful operation the night before whereupon they intercepted several EF-111 \\"Ravens\\" that were jamming Iraqi radars. Subsequently, Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners were able to wreak havoc on a now unprotected sortie of F-15E bombers. The plan involved having two MiG-25 aircraft from different directions vectored onto an isolated group of F-15s. If the F-15s tried to attack one of the MiGs, the other would be in a flanking position which would enable it to down the F-15s more easily. Iraq didn't evacuate their MiG-25 \\"Foxbats\\" in order to retain them for this mission. Monitoring Coalition AWACS and F-15 frequencies, Iraqi forces waited for the proper situation to begin the operation. Battle Finally on January 30, an Iraqi intelligence unit intercepted communications that one of the patrols, \\"Xerex 31\\" was approaching \\"bingo fuel\\" which necessitated an hour and a half round trip to an aerial tanker. This left just two F-15 jets, \\"Xerex 33\\" piloted by USAF Capt. Thomas Dietz, and another by 1st Lt. Robert Hehemann, in the area. Recognizing the opportunity, two MiG-25s were scrambled from two separate air bases. Capt. Mahmoud Awad took off from Qadessiya Air Base, while Capt. Mohammed Jassi as-Sammarai took off from Tammuz Air Base. After engaging a false target, both pilots were directed to Dietz and Hehemann by Iraqi air traffic control. The two flights immediately engaged one another, with Hehemann firing two missiles, one of which was a dud. At the same time, as- Sammarai locked Hehemann up and fired an R-40 missile, which went ballistic after as-Sammarai was forced into evasive maneuvers to avoid Hehemann's missile. As-Sammarai's missile damaged Hehemann's left engine, but his F-15 remained flyable. Meanwhile, Dietz engaged Awad, attempting to fire several missiles at him. After Dietz's missiles failed to fire three times, Awad managed to get a radar lock on Dietz's F-15, putting him onto the defensive. Dietz attempted to disengage, heading east. Hehemann, still engaged with as- Sammarai, fired another missile in an attempt to down the Iraqi MiG, and then found himself locked up by the now unoccupied Awad. Hehemann avoided Awad's missile with the use of chaff and flares. As-Sammarai and Awad then disengaged to the west in full afterburner, back towards Tammuz Air Base. At the same time, \\"Xerex 31\\" was returning from the aerial tanker and had been monitoring the air battle. Pilots Lt. Col. Randy Bigum and 1st Lt. Lynn Broome decided to direct their F-15s in an attempt to intercept the two MiG-25s. However, a high altitude crosswind forced them over Baghdad, which was the most heavily defended airspace in Iraq. The two were subsequently locked onto by Iraqi gunners. Bigum would later admit he didn't notice the drift because he and his wing-man were determined to score a MiG kill. Despite this, they still managed to achieve radar lock up on both as-Sammarai and Awad, and each fired a missile at them. Both missed. Bigum fired a second missile at Awad, but Awad landed his aircraft before the missile arrived. Bigum fired again at as- Sammarai as he was on his final landing approach, but Bigum lost the radar lock as as-Sammarai landed and the missile impacted the ground about from as- Sammarai's left wingtip. Bigum and Broome egressed the area before they could be shot down by SAMs, which were still targeting them. Result The Iraqi Air Force first credited as-Sammarai with a \\"possible\\" victory which was later upgraded to \\"confirmed\\" after a Bedouin smuggler discovered wreckage of an F-15 very close to where Iraqi radars had allegedly lost track of a falling F-15 on January 30. Later Iraqi government documents claim two F-15s recorded as being shot down in this engagement. However, there is no record of an F-15 being shot down on January 30 in the area west of Baghdad. Nonetheless, this is probably the closest an F-15 has ever come to being shot down in air-to-air combat. Operation Samurra was the last offensive operation of the Iraqi Air Force during the Gulf War. By mid-February all Iraqi Air Force activity had effectively ceased as the Coalition completed their dominance over the skies, and not a single offensive sortie was even attempted during the ground phase of the war. Most of the MiG-25's in Iraq's arsenal survived the war, and went on to serve until the 2003 Invasion of Iraq when they were buried, by which time they remained in various states of airworthiness. Dietz and Hehemann would go on to be the highest scoring fighter pilots of the Gulf War, with three air-air kills apiece by the war's end. Bigum and Broome finished the war with no air-air kills, with the Samurra becoming the closest they would get.

With his wife, he built Ochre Court in Newport, Rhode Island, his son built Glenmere mansion, and his daughter, Mary Goelet, married Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe. Early life Ogden Goelet was born on September 29, 1851 in Manhattan, New York City to Sarah Ogden (1809‚Äì1888) and Robert Goelet (1809‚Äì1879). His father was a prominent landlord in New York City, as was his uncle, Peter Goelet, who was named after Peter Goelet, Ogden's great-grandfather. His parents resided at 5 State Street, overlooking the Battery in Manhattan. Goelet's older brother was real estate developer Robert Goelet, and his nephew was Robert Walton Goelet. His paternal aunt, Hannah Green Goelet, was married to Thomas Russell Gerry, a son of U.S. Vice President Elbridge Gerry. Through this marriage, Goelet was a first cousin of Elbridge Thomas Gerry. Career Ogden Goelet's mansion at 608 Fifth Avenue, designed by E.H. Kendall Newport residence, Ochre Court in 1904. Along with his brother, he managed the real estate of his father, Robert Goelet, and his uncle Peter Goelet, who both died in 1879. After his father and uncles deaths, he inherited almost half their fortune, along with his brother. In New York, he was one of the stockholders of the Metropolitan Opera House, holding Box No. 1. =Society life= In 1892, Goelet and his wife Mary were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Mary was known as one of the viceregal leaders of the Ultra-fashionable 150, among Mrs. Astor, Mrs. Ogden Mills, Mrs. John Jacob Astor, and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. =Yachting= Goelet's 1881 Norseman schooner He had several yachts including his schooner, Norseman that was designed by William Townsend and built in 1881 at the Richard & Cornelius Poillon shipyard in Brooklyn. From 1893 he also chartered Lillie Langtry's yacht the White Ladye. His final yacht was named Mayflower and was designed by George Lennox Watson in 1896 and built on the Clyde (Scotland) by J & G Thompson. After Goelet's death the yacht was sold to the US Navy and became the famous USS Mayflower (PY-1). Goelet's brother, Robert, had an almost identical yacht built at the same time and in the same yard and this later became USS Nahma (SP-771). =Residences= Goelet and his wife owned a townhouse at 608 Fifth Avenue in New York City and a villa in Nice, France. When in London, they resided at Wimbourne House. In 1892, he and his wife commissioned Ochre Court, a ch√¢teauesque mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. The home was built at a cost of $4.5 million and was the second largest mansion in Newport after nearby The Breakers, both designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt. Personal life In 1878, he married Mary Rita Wilson (1855‚Äì1929), daughter of Richard Thornton Wilson Sr. and Melissa Clementine Johnston. Her siblings included the banker Richard Thornton Wilson Jr. and socialite Grace Graham Wilson, who was married to Cornelius Vanderbilt III. Together, they were the parents of two children: * Mary Goelet (1878‚Äì1937), who married Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe (1876‚Äì1932) in 1903. * Robert Wilson Goelet (1880‚Äì1966), who built Glenmere mansion. He was a member of the New York Yacht Club for 17 years, as well as the Knickerbocker Club, Metropolitan Club, and Union Club. On August 27, 1897, after over five years spent abroad, Goelet died aboard his yacht in the town of Cowes in the Isle of Wight after having been ill for two months. He had been attended to by William Broadbent, doctor to the Prince of Wales, with whom he was close friends. His family and body sailed back to the United States and his funeral was held aboard his yacht in Newport and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York). In his will, he left his entire estate to his wife and two children. His widow died in 1929.

This technique is used when a loop cannot be fully parallelized by DOALL parallelism due to data dependencies between loop iterations, typically loop- carried dependencies. The sections of the loop which contain loop-carried dependence are synchronized, while treating each section as a parallel task on its own. Therefore, DOACROSS parallelism can be used to complement DOALL parallelism to reduce loop execution times.  Description  DOACROSS parallelism is particularly useful when one statement depends on the values generated by another statement. In such a loop, DOALL parallelism can not be implemented in a straightforward manner. If the first statement blocks the execution of the second statement until the required value has been produced, then the two statements would be able to execute independent of each other (i.e.), each of the aforementioned statements would be parallelized for simultaneous execution using DOALL parallelism. The following pseudocode illustrates the operation of DOACROSS parallelism in such a situation. = Example = for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { a[i] = a[i-2] + b[i]*c[i] + d[i]/e[i] + 1; } In this example, each iteration of the loop requires the value written into a by the previous iteration. However, the entire statement is not dependent on the previous iteration, but only a portion of it. The statement is split into two blocks to illustrate this. post (0); for ( int i =0; i < N; i++) { temp = b[i]*c[i] + d[i]/e[i] + 1; wait (i-2); a[i] = a[i-2] + temp; post (i); } The first statement has no loop carried dependence now, and the result of this statement is stored in the variable temp. The post () command is used to signal that the required result has been produced for utilization by other threads. The wait (i-2) command waits for the value a[i-2] before unblocking. The execution time of DOACROSS parallelism largely depends on what fraction of the program suffers from loop-carried dependence. Larger gains are observed when a sizable portion of the loop is affected by loop-carried dependence.  Drawbacks  DOACROSS parallelism suffers from significant space and granularity overheads due to the synchronization primitives used. Modern day compilers often overlook this method because of this major disadvantage. The overheads may be reduced by reducing the frequency of synchronization across the loop, by applying the primitives for groups of statements at a time.

Education and Professional  Cardoso de Melo Neto did his preparatory courses at Escola Complementar, an appendix to Escola Normal de S√£o Paulo. In 1901, he enrolled at the traditional Faculdade de Direito do Largo de S√£o Francisco, getting his bachelor on Law School in August 1906. During his studies, Cardoso occupied the presidency of the C√≠rculo Jur√≠dico Acad√™mico. Four years later, in 1910, he became president of the Sociedade An√¥nima El√©trica Rio Claro, a notorious company on the field of electric energy in the State of S√£o Paulo, where he remained until 1934. In October 1917, as a substitute professor, Cardoso got his title at the fifth section of the Administrative Law, Administration Science, Economic Politics and Finance Science chair. In 1920, he would be entitled a professor of the last two. Afterwards, in 1941, he became the director of the school he once studied at. Thus, in November 1953, Cardoso received the title of emeritus professor of the school. Cardoso was also one of the founders of Liga Nacionalista, created in 1917 as an ideia from Rui Barbosa and the poet Olavo Bilac. The goal was to adopt the practice of secret voting and the obligatoriness of the military service. In 1926, he would help the founding of the Partido Democr√°tico (Democratic Party) of S√£o Paulo. Besides remaining as the head of Mercantil Bank, Carsoso was also a part of Comercial Bank of the State of S√£o Paulo's (Banco Comercial do Estado de S√£o Paulo), Rodrigues Alves Agricultural Company's (Companhia Agr√≠cola Rodrigues Alves) and Pira√ßununga's Wiring and Weaving's (Fia√ß√£o e Tecelagem de Pira√ßununga) Administrative Council.  Democratic Party (Partido Democr√°tico - PD)  One of the Democratic Party's first achievements was to urge to the February 1928's state campaign, which resulted in the election of several deputies. Cardoso de Melo Neto, for instance, was elected from the fifth district of S√£o Paulo. However, as many other candidates from his party, he didn't get his election legitimized. In the beginning of 1929, the Democratic Party joined the Alian√ßa Liberal, a coalition of politic forces in opposition to the Washington Lu√≠s's government that introduced the candidacy of Get√∫lio Vargas and Jo√£o Pessoa to the Brazilian presidency and vice-presidency. Cardoso de Melo Neto, as the representative chosen, was part of the Alian√ßa Liberal's convention which validated the opposition's candidacy pleas.  Politic Life  The win by the Alian√ßa Liberal made even stronger the ties from its various areas, including the Democratic Party. The process of preparing an armed movement got intensified after the murder of Jo√£o Pessoa, which took place on July 26, 1930. On October 24, it took place Washington Lu√≠s's deposition in Rio de Janeiro, leaving the govern to be composed by three official-generals from the army, whom which decided to give the post to general Hast√≠nfilo de Moura, commanding officer of the second Military Region. Having governed provisionally the state for only four days, (until October 28, 1930), the general composed sort of a council, of which members of the Democratic Party were part of. During this period, which became known as \\"the 40 days government\\", general Hast√≠nfilo de Moura got replaced by Jos√© Maria Whitaker, Pl√≠nio Barreto and, finally, captain Jo√£o Alberto Lins de Barros. Cardoso de Melo Neto became the mayor of S√£o Paulo, capital os the state of S√£o Paulo. Cardoso also represented the Democratic Party on the negotiations for the creation of the Chapa √önica por S√£o Paulo Unido (Single Party to unite S√£o Paulo). The plate, which mixed the Democratic Party, the Paulista's Republican Party, the Catholic Electoral League and the Volunteer's Federation, was fighting for liberal and federalist characteristics, going against the politic and economic centralization organized by the federal government, then ruled by general Valdomiro Lima. In February 1924, Cardoso de Melo joined the new Constitutionalist Party, the result of the merge between the Democratic Party, the Republican's National Act and the Volunteers Federation, guided by Armando de Sales Oliveira. Elected as federal deputy on the same year, Cardoso got to join the Mixed Commission of Economic-Finance Reform, and accumulated his parliamentary roles to the presidency of S√£o Paulo's Mercantil Bank and the lighting company Jundia√≠'s Strength.

He was a political prisoner in the GDR, and from 1996 to 1999, he was the State Commissioner for Stasi documents in Saxony. Early life and education Faust was the son of a technical illustrator, Ingeborg Kayenberg, and a Cypriot father whose name he has never known. All that is apparently known is that his father was a British soldier in the Anti-Hitler Coalition and a prisoner of war. Faust took his surname from his stepfather, who died of complications relating to asbestosis in 1977. Faust's mother committed suicide in 1996. Faust grew up in Heidenau, near Dresden, and in 1964 graduated from the High School at the Children's and Youth Sports School in Dresden. He then began studying art education and history at the University of Leipzig, but in 1966, after organizing a reading of uncensored poetry, some of which was reportedly \\"anti-Party,\\" he was charged with \\"lack of discipline and political unreliability\\" and put on probation. He was forced to spend a year working in a rayon factory. In 1967 he was permitted to resume studying at the Johannes R. Becher Literature Institute at the University of Leipzig, but was expelled in 1968 on grounds of \\"subversive incitement\\" after writing a poem that mentioned the popular uprising of 17 June 1953. (In 1993, after the fall of Communism, the university acknowledged that his expulsions had been politically motivated.) Early career in East Germany Faust went on to become a writer, although he earned his living mostly as a laborer, and, later, as a transport worker. He became a member of a circle of artists that included Wolfgang Hilbig, Gert Neumann, and Andreas Reimann. Unable to publish in East Germany, he circulated his writings privately. Beginning in 1968, the Stasi monitored his movements and had him followed. In 1971, he was detained in Leipzig on charges of \\"subversive incitement\\" for seeking to publish his works in the Federal Republic. He was amnestied without trial, however. In 1973, he officially applied to emigrate and signed a petition charging the East German government with denying its citizens human rights in violation of UN agreements. He was again arrested for \\"subversive incitement\\" and sentenced by the District Court of Dresden to four and a half years in prison. Imprisonment During the 1970s, he spent a total of 33 months in prison. He spent over 400 days in a so-called \\"tiger cage,\\" a damp, cold basement cell. While in one prison he established the SED ‚Äì Central Organ New Germany, which issued the handwritten newspaper Poor Germany, which was passed from hand to hand. But Faust was more than 400 days in a double-barred, damp and cold basement cell (\\"tiger cage\\") caught kept. Fellow inmates smuggled ink cartridges and butter into his cell. He spent over two years in solitary confinement before being released early in March 1976 as a result of protests in East Germany and abroad. In September 1976 he was permitted to leave the country for West Germany. West Germany From 1976 to 1989, Faust worked as a freelance writer and screenwriter, as a lecturer, and as chief editor of the magazines DDR Today and Christians over There. United Germany From 1996 to 1999, he served as the Saxon State Commissioner for the Stasi Files in Saxony. From 2003 to 2006, he studied philosophy, political science, and theology at W√ºrzburg.

Plot summary The Mystery Incorporated gang goes to visit the Crazy Q Dude Ranch, which is owned by Shaggy Rogers' long lost cousin, Tawny Rogers. When the gang arrives, the residents scream in fright at the sight of Shaggy, and claim he is a ghost. After the gang meets Tawny, she explains that years ago, the ranch was once haunted by a ruthless western outlaw named Dapper Jack and points out that Shaggy looks just like him, due to the fact that he is Jack's descendant. Tawny says Dapper Jack's ghost has been terrorizing the ranch and if he continues, she will be forced to sell it. Afterwards, the gang begins investigating so Tawny will not have to sell the ranch. After investigating Jack's grave, and a few close encounters with his ghost, the gang solves the mystery and decide to trap the ghost. That night at a rodeo with a grand prize of $10,000, Scooby-Doo helps a young boy get over his fear of horses while Shaggy rides a horse very successfully, much to the surprise of his friends. Later, Shaggy gives the prize money to Tawny to help her with the ranch.

After this, the gang learns that Dapper Jack was not really an outlaw but a kind soul. The town sheriff Rufus Carmichael killed him and framed him for all those crimes and Kyle used the false legend for his scheme. However, the gang also learns that Kyle was not alone and Velma announces that a man named Rafe was working with him. After Rafe confesses that he owns the company that wants to buy Tawny's ranch, he then steals the money and runs away. He is chased by Shaggy and Scooby who force him off the track and retrieve the money. After Rafe and Kyle are taken to jail, Tawny thanks Shaggy and his friends for their help.

It is a four-door, five-passenger sedan that was designed by Alfred Ney of the Bendix Corporation in South Bend, Indiana. Although considered a proof- of-concept vehicle rather than a true prototype for future production, the Bendix SWC is regarded as ahead of its time because of its innovative features, incorporating front-wheel drive, four-wheel hydraulic brakes with open drums for better cooling, and four-wheel independent suspension that used A-arms mounted in rubber blocks in place of conventional springs. The styling was similar to other examples of automotive streamlining such as the contemporary DeSoto Airflow and Chrysler Airflow. Development Vincent Bendix and Victor Kliesrath, his vice president in charge of engineering, were instrumental in the design and development of the Bendix SWC.Phillips 2011, p. 92. With the acquisition of the Peerless Motor Company in 1931, Bendix began to contemplate a return to automobile production. His early venture from 1907-1909 had resulted in a limited production of 7,000 vehicles before production ceased.Wood, Jonathon. \\"Bendix.\\" Thoroughbred & Classic Cars, October 1980, p. 55. To show the capabilities of the Bendix Corporation. the new car incorporated many of the Bendix products such as the famed Bendix Startex system, Scintilla magnetos, Stromberg carburetors, Pioneer instruments, and Bragg-Kliesrath vacuum brake boosters. With General Motors, however, as a shareholder in the company and U.S. automakers his main clientele, Bendix feared that his car would be seen as competition to his biggest clients. The top-secret program was set up with a \\"dummy\\" company designation, the \\"Steel Wheel Corporation\\". The SWC designation on the project was intended to further disguise the true intentions of the project.Danielson 2001, p. 27. With the work carried out in secret, Bendix directed a young engineer, Alfred M. Ney, to design a car based on a unit-body platform with front drive. When the preliminary blueprints were finished, a small team of designers and mechanics was enlisted to flesh out the design. William F. Ortwig, who had done work for Fisher Body coachbuilders, created a streamlined body design. After two and a half years of work at the Bendix Automotive Development Center, Benton Harbor, Michigan, at a cost of $84,000, the car was completed, and ready to enter proving trials.Suman-Hreblay 2000, p. 39. Design The Bendix SWC was intended to be a unit-body design, but limited time and finances dictated a conventional and heavier steel box frame central member with front and rear subframes. The body construction was orthodox with steel panels mounted over a wooden frame, but curb weight climbed to more than 3,000 pounds, twice the 1,500- to 1,700-pound target weight. To counter the weight gain, aluminum was used for the hood, fenders, doors, and rear wheel skirts. Due to an impending deadline, Ortwig used a DeSoto Airflow grille and headlamp doors to finish the car. The SWC design featured many technological innovations. The 86-horsepower, straight-six Continental engine and its transaxle were mounted on rubber bushings, as was the rear suspension. The unique powertrain and front-drive, three-speed transaxle mounted in front of the engine could rotate independently of the body. Constant-velocity universal joints transmitted the power to the front wheels. Cooling for the engine came from a complicated latent heat exchanger, eliminating a cooling fan. The novel suspension had limited suspension travel with low-pressure tires taking up road shocks. The SWC used drum brakes that were cooled through openings in the drums and wheelcovers. Although a conventional shift lever was first used, a Bendix \\"Finger-Tip Control\\" electrical preselector mechanism, similar to that used by Cord and Hudson automobiles, was substituted. Included in the full instrumentation, a clock was mounted in the center of the steering wheel. Introduction In November 1934, despite not having solved the weight problem, which the designer feared would make his suspension unable to cope, Bendix and Kliesrath decided to send the SWC on a European tour of automobile manufacturers. After demonstrations in England for Alvis and Bentley Motors Limited, the car was shipped to France, where the SWC was demonstrated at Citro√´n, Peugeot, Renault, and Bugatti.Lamm, Michael, ed. \\"FWD Bendix SWC.\\" Special-Interest Autos, November/December 1971, p. 41. Retrieved: November 28, 2016. The trip was cut short in Genoa, Italy, when a constant-velocity joint broke. Due to the strain of the heavy body and frame, the universal joints had a limited ability to cope with the engine's torque at full left or full right lock, resulting in drivers having to fight the wheel in turns. The heavy SWC also wore out the rubber blocks. The damaged SWC was shipped by rail to Le Havre, France, and loaded on the German liner, SS ‚Äò‚ÄôBremen‚Äò‚Äô, for return to the United States. Cancellation While Bendix and Kliesrath were in Europe, General Motors, worried by the company's plunging stock value and the flamboyant lifestyle by its free-spending CEO, decided to exercise its 25% share in Bendix and force him out.

Biography  Shelomo Bekhor Hussein was born in Baghdad in 1843 to a connected rabbinic family. One of his ancestors was Rabbi Sadqa Bekhor Hussein (1699-1743), author of the work \\"Sedaka Umishpat.\\" Hussein was one of the students of Rabbi Abdallah Somekh and learned in his yeshiva, the Midrash Bet Zilkha. Rabbi Hussein had wide-ranging interests and engaged in a diversity of activities in his life. Among other things he would write regularly for the contemporary Hebrew press, including periodicals that were published in Baghdad, India, Ottoman Palestine, and Eastern Europe. Over the years he wrote more than 150 articles for various newspapers, such as Le Libanon, Hamagid, Ha-Tsefirah, Habatzeleth, Hadover (Baghdad), Hamevaser (Calcutta), and others. His articles covered topics such as Jewish communal life in Iraq, Kurdistan, and Persia; as well as Jewish law, ethics, culture, world politics, and current events. His articles are a vital primary source on the cultural life and travails of the Jews of Iraq and Iran in his day. They also express his personal approach which blended an acceptance of Maskilic and modern values with the importance of preserving tradition. In the educational sphere, he served as principal of the Midrash Talmud Torah in Baghdad, as well as a stint as a Talmud teacher in the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle school. As a posek he decided halakhic questions from across Iraq and the Baghdadi community in India and other countries. In 1867 he founded a Hebrew press in Baghdad (the third such enterprise in the city). This publishing house continued to function through his son even after his death. Among the books he published were anthologies of stories of ethical and personal development that he collected himself. He also invested in securing subscriptions for various Hebrew periodicals (like Hamagid) among Baghdadi Jews. Rabbi Hussein dreamed of establishing a bilingual journal in Hebrew and Arabic in Baghdad but was unable to secure permission for such a project from the Ottoman Sultanate. Over the years he translated several works from Hebrew to Judeo-Arabic, including sections of the Passover Haggada and the Siddur. He passed away in 1892 at age 49, in his native Baghdad.

Glenn Reeves (born Floyd Glenn Reeves December 29, 1930 - November 19, 1998) was an American rockabilly singer-songwriter and radio deejay. He released eight singles in his recording career, but is best- remembered for his demo of the song \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" which later became Elvis Presley's first number one hit.  Biography  Reeves was raised in Shamrock, Texas; while in high school he formed his first band which played Western swing music. He studied briefly at the University of Houston before serving in the Korean War. After returning from the military, he received a position as a radio deejay on KCTX (AM) Radio in Childress. In 1955, Reeves recorded his debut single \\"I'm Johnny on the Spot\\" for record producer Bob Tanner's TNT Records. Reeves recorded an additional single for the label in the same year. A frequent collaborator with him was Mae Boren Axton, a high school teacher with a background in musical promotion who co-wrote all four of Reeves' TNT sides. Axton, who was tasked with writing a song for Elvis Presley, worked most frequently with steel guitarist Tommy Durden, culminating with the basis for the song \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", in October 1955. The duo asked for Reeves' help, but remarked it was \\"the silliest thing I've ever heard\\" after he heard the title of the track. Nonetheless, Axton recorded an initial version with Durden before Reeves returned, and agreed to record his own demo of \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" in a style similar to Presley's. Reeves refused an offer to be co-credited with the song, but, when Presley recorded it, he duplicated Reeves's own phrasing; \\"Elvis was even breathing in the same places that Glenn did on the dub\\" Durbin later recalled. It was Presley's first record for RCA Records and also the first of a string of number one hits. Reeves continued to work with Axton and Durden on compositions like \\"Honey Bop\\" for Wanda Jackson and \\"Rockin' Country Style\\", a rock and roll tune which Reeves recorded in June 1956 for Atco Records. Both \\"Rockin' Country Style\\" and an earlier single distributed by Republic Records were produced by Murray Nash in Nashville. When Atco showed no interest in renewing his recording contract, Nash and Axton advertised Reeves's services around Nashville and secured a four-record deal with Decca Records. He recorded in 1957 and 1958 with little success, and later focused on the music scene in Florida disc jockeying on WQIK Radio and hosting his own country music show. In the 1970s and 1980s, Reeves became the executive producer of Jamboree USA, a long-running barn dance show, while promoting several successful country music festivals. Reeves died of cancer in 1998 at 67 years old. In 2011, Bear Family Records released Johnny on the Spot: Gonna Shake This Shack Tonight, a compilation album of Reeves's recorded works, including his demo of \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\".

In early 1972, skeletal remains of both girls were discovered in and around Clear Lake near Galveston Bay. A local man, Michael Lloyd Self, was charged with their murders in 1972 and convicted of Shaw's murder in 1975. Controversy arose in 1998 when serial killer Edward Harold Bell confessed to the murders. Bell's confession--and corroborating statements from both law enforcement and prosecutors that Self had been coerced into a false confession --led many to believe that Self had been wrongfully convicted. Self died in prison in 2000. The case has often been associated with the Texas Killing Fields, a 25-acre section of land off of Interstate 45 in southern Texas where the bodies of over 30 people, mainly young women, have been discovered since the 1970s. A fictionalized film about the area, titled Texas Killing Fields, was released in 2011. Disappearance Rhonda Johnson (born December 16, 1956, in Houston, Texas) and Sharon Shaw (born August 11, 1957, in Mobile, Alabama), both of Webster, Texas, spent the day (Wednesday, August 4, 1971) on a Galveston Bay beach in Galveston approximately one week before Sharon's fourteenth birthday. The girls were seen leaving the beach, but they did not return home. Eyewitnesses reported last seeing the girls walking on Seawall Boulevard in Galveston. Discovery of bodies On January 3, 1972, two boys fishing in Clear Lake discovered a human skull floating in the water, which they had initially believed to be a sports ball.Unsolved Mysteries, season 5, episode 2. May 19, 1993. NBC Networks. Six weeks later, searchers discovered the rest of the body, along with that of another girl, in a marsh near the lake. According to a coroner's inquest filed on February 17, 1972, the skull found in the lake was determined via dental records to have belonged to Sharon Shaw. Additionally, a crucifix found wrapped around the jawbone of the skull was identified by Shaw's mother to have belonged to her daughter. The other body found in the marsh was positively identified as Rhonda Johnson. Investigation =Michael Lloyd Self= In May 1972, a tip was received from Glenn Price, a city councilman, to look into Michael Lloyd Self, a gas station attendant and sex offender in Galveston. Police visited Self at his workplace, and he voluntarily went to the police station the following day for questioning. When shown photos of Shaw and Johnson, Self admitted to recognizing the girls, but stated that he did not know them. According to Self, Chief Michael Morris held him in confinement for hours, remarking that Self would not leave until he had made a confession. Self also stated that he was held against a wall, hit with a nightstick, and taunted by Morris with his pistol, who threatened to kill Self if he did not confess. Self eventually agreed to confess, and he was forced by Morris to handwrite a confession to the murders of Shaw and Johnson. Morris allegedly forced Self to rewrite the confession several times. Dave Coburn, a local investigator, corroborated Self's story by claiming to have witnessed Morris treat a prisoner exactly the same way a year prior. The final signed confession by Self contained several discrepancies. Self stated he had dumped Shaw's and Johnson's bodies in El Lago, which was over 20 miles from the marsh where police discovered the remains. Self also wrote that he had strangled both girls to death, though reports from the medical examiner showed no evidence of strangulation. Three days after his confession, on June 23, 1972, Self provided further \\"details\\" to police in an oral confession that conflicted with his initial written confession. In an interview with Deputy Sheriff W.A. Turner and Deputy Sheriff Frank Beamer, Self claimed that he had picked up Shaw and Johnson from a Sizzler steakhouse and that they had driven around the El Largo neighborhood and gotten food from a local Jack in the Box restaurant. According to Beamer, Self said he then pulled over into a secluded area, struck the girls over the head with a Coca-Cola bottle, stripped their clothes off, and thrown the clothes onto the highway. (This last claim conflicted with the fact that the girls' clothing was discovered with their remains.) Self then claimed to have thrown the girls' bodies in a culvert on Choate Road. Two weeks later, sheriff's deputies checked Self out of jail and drove him to the various locations mentioned in his confession and photographed him at each of the locations. These photos would later be presented in court, though Self's attorney said the taking of the photos was illegal. =Conviction and aftermath= Self's trial began on May 15, 1973, and concluded on September 18, 1974. Self was convicted of the first-degree murder of Shaw and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was not convicted of Johnson's murder. An October 9, 1974, appeal of the case was denied. Three years later in 1976, Chief Don Morris and Deputy Tommy Deal, both of whom had worked on Self's case, were arrested and charged with multiple bank robberies dating back to 1972. Morris was sentenced to 55 years in prison, and Deal was sentenced to 30 years. Self was denied parole numerous times, and he unsuccessfully appealed his conviction over the course of his sentence. In a September 22, 1992, written petition for appeal, reference to coercion in his confession was made, reading: > The district court acknowledged that the state court had twice found that no > force or threats were used against Self to obtain his June 9 confession. > Nevertheless, it found that the confession was so obtained and not freely > given, despite Miranda warnings having been given. This finding is > influenced by its earlier, unwarranted, sua sponte illegal arrest ruling, as > well as by credibility choices contrary to those made by the state trial > judge, who had an opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor, and whose > province included weighing conflicting testimony. Self was refused a new trial by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993, thus exhausting his appeals. He died in prison of cancer in 2000. In 2011, the Houston Chronicle published an article in which Self's attorneys stated their belief that Self was wrongly accused and coerced into making a false confession. The article also noted that two investigators, a Galveston police officer and a former Harris County prosecutor, also believed Self had been wrongly convicted. Other confessions On April 2, 1980, a man in Taylor Lake, Texas walked into the local police department and claimed to have been responsible for the murders. In his confession, the man allegedly mentioned having tied the girls down with electrical cord, a detail that had not been released to the public, nor ever mentioned by Michael Self. The man, apparently suffering from psychosis, was eventually dismissed by police, despite his mention of the electrical cord, as well as the fact that he lived in close proximity to one of the victims. =Edward Harold Bell= In 1998, Edward Harold Bell wrote multiple letters to prosecutors in Galveston and Harris Counties, confessing to the murders of numerous young women. At the time, Bell was serving a seventy-year sentence for the 1978 murder of a 26-year-old Pasadena Marinehoustonchronicle.com who had attempted to stop him from publicly masturbating in front of a group of teenage girls. In August 2015, Bell admitted to murdering a total of eleven girls, whom he referred to as the \\"Eleven that went to Heaven,\\" and claimed to have been brainwashed and forced to kill by a secret organization. He named Shaw and Johnson among the girls he admitted to murdering; however, Bell was never charged in the murders of either Shaw or Johnson. On April 20, 2019, Bell died in prison at the age of 82.

It is part of the shadow banking system in Malaysia. The borrowers are restricted to employees in government departments, statutory bodies, government-linked companies or municipal councils. The Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (CUEPACS) supports these loans because they aid civil servants in overcoming financial problems and reducing borrowing from loan sharks. All matters relating to the administration of these loans are regulated under the Cooperative Society Act of 1993. Loan features Cooperative loans in Malaysia share some common features such as: =Repayment by salary deduction= Payment of monthly installment is via an automatic salary deduction by a government-related body called the National Cooperative Movement of Malaysia (ANGKASA). Loan size is limited to RM250,000 (maximum allowed) or to the maximum installment amount that can be deducted from the borrower‚Äôs salary. Loan installments together with other deductions cannot exceed the maximum 60% limit on salary deductions imposed by the Public Services Department. This is to ensure that the take- home pay is at least 40% of gross salary. The maximum tenure is 10 years (the maximum tenure allowable by Bank Negara Malaysia) or until retirement year, whichever comes first. =Sharia compliance= The vast majority of personal loans offered by the cooperatives are Islamic loans that comply with the Sharia guidelines set by SKM. These loans are based on Islamic banking and finance principles such as Tawarruq and Murabahah which involve the buying and selling of commodity payable by installment or deferred payment. Using the buying-selling model, interest (riba) which is forbidden (haram), is replaced by a profit margin agreed upon between the buyer and the seller. Most cooperative loans come with compulsory takaful insurance protection that covers the outstanding amount in circumstances of death or total permanent disability. =Dependence on borrowed funds= Cooperatives provide credit facilities to their members by using either their own or borrowed funds. Since cooperatives funds are limited, the operations of these loans are primarily dependent on consistent and constant funding from financial institutions. Popular commercial banks in Malaysia such as Maybank, RHB Bank, Kuwait Finance House and Bank Rakyat are currently funding or have in the past contributed funds to the cooperatives. =Approval rate= The approval rate of cooperative loans is very high, as credit score is irrelevant since monthly installment repayment is automatic. Applicants who have been blacklisted by banks due to poor credit score as reflected by Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) and the Credit Tip-Off System (CTOS) successfully apply for cooperative loans. Controversies These plans have many critics, one of the most vocal being the Consumer Association of Penang. Among the criticism directed at the cooperatives include encouraging over-borrowing and burdening the borrowers with long-term debts. =Long-term debt burden= In the past, cooperative loan schemes have had very long tenure, up to a maximum of 25 years. A loan stretched over a long tenure allows the borrower to pay lower monthly installment and hence be eligible for a higher loan amount. The maximum loan amount is RM250,000. In June 2013, in an effort to rein in rising household debt, Bank Negara restricted all personal loan borrowings to a maximum of 10 years. This ruling effectively reduced borrowings under the cooperative schemes and led to protests by the cooperatives. The Congress of Union of Employees in the Public And Civil Services (CUEPACS) also opposed the Central Bank‚Äôs new ruling and suggested a compromised solution of 15 years tenure. According to them, many government employees will borrow from loan sharks if they are unable to secure cooperative loans. Despite much opposition, the 10-year loan tenure cap is still in place today. =Illegal schemes= Some cooperatives are found to be operating illegal loan schemes and charging exorbitant interest. In August 2016, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (Malaysia) (KPDNKK) ordered the closure of 12 cooperatives found operating loan schemes with the involvement of loan sharks. The minister of KPDNKK, Datuk Hamzah, announced that the government was working on improving the Cooperative Act of 1993 to better regulate the activities of nearly 13,000 registered cooperatives throughout the country. =High effective interest rates= Another criticism revolves around the actual cost of the loan. Prior to 2012, the typical interest rate of most cooperative loan was around 10% per annum calculated on a flat rate. Borrowers only received 81% of the loan amount with 19% deducted for various fees and expenses including a commission to agents. A recalculation of interest rates based on effective rates on the actual money received showed that borrowers were paying interest of 24% per annum. Cooperative loans today Increased competition among cooperatives offering loans resulted in interest rate steadily declining. Most cooperative loans today charge an interest of 4% - 7% per annum with payout usually around 90% to 95%, which makes the cost of cooperative loans similar to bank loans. Cooperative loans are meant to be a more viable option for civil servants with poor credit score cooperative loans compared to license money lenders who charge 18% per annum (maximum allowable interest rate as stipulated by the Money Lending Act 1951).

Career  Diop did not have an early interest in acting, but rather planned to pursue a career in textiles, specifically as a parachutist. The recommendation of a friend made Diop think more seriously about acting and the arts, and prompted Diop to reach out to Josephine Baker. After a correspondence, Baker invited Diop to visit her in France, but Diop had to decline due to cost. Diop frequented the Cine-Club in Dakar, where she was exposed to French and American films, and later enrolled at the Ecole des Arts de Dakar when she was sixteen, where she took night courses and studied under French actor Robert Fontaine (who later also starred in Black Girl). Diop worked as a seamstress during the day. =Black Girl= A photographer working at the Actualiti√©s S√©n√©galaises took a photograph of Diop which was seen by filmmaker Ousmane Semb√®ne, who contacted Diop regarding Black Girl. Diop's family was very opposed to Diop's interest in film, but after Semb√®ne visited with Diop she decided to accept the role. Her family and those in her neighborhood did not approve of her choice, and actively scorned her. In The Cineaste, poet A. Van Jordan wrote of Diop's performance in Black Girl: \\"Diouana (Mbissine Th√©r√®se Diop) is one of those characters you fall in love with as soon as they enter the story. Diop is one of those actors you want to stare at a couple of hours, easy. So this is an equation for emotional investment--if not unbridled infatuation, at least--woven into the writing and the casting.\\" =Emitai= In 1971, Diop appeared in Semb√®ne's film Emitai. =Later career= Diop still works in textiles. In 2020 Diop starred in the film Cuties as a community matriarch. The film has received critical acclaim and controversy.

Biography =Origins and education= Born in RƒÉ»ôinari, Sibiu County, in the Transylvania region, his parents were the Romanian Orthodox priest Sava Popovici-Barcianu and his wife Stanca (n√©e Cioran). Barcianu, who had a brother and two sisters, attended the local church's primary school, followed by the Lutheran gymnasium in Sibiu from 1858 to 1866. He then studied at the Sibiu theological institute from 1866 to 1869. During the 1869-1870 school year, he taught at the church school in his native village. The same year, Barcianu was sent to Germany, tasked with studying school organization in Dresden and its surroundings, in order to apply his findings at home.PƒÉcurariu, p. 247 In the autumn of 1870, Metropolitan Andrei »òaguna, whom he had known since childhood, granted him a scholarship to study at German- language universities. He took courses in philosophy, pedagogy and natural sciences at the universities of Vienna (1870-1871), Bonn (1871-1872) and Leipzig (1872-1874). He wrote frequent letters to his father about his studies and travels, covering topics such as the ongoing Franco-Prussian War and his lectures with Friedrich Nietzsche. He received a doctorate in philosophy at Leipzig in the summer of 1874, with a thesis about botany.PƒÉcurariu, p. 248 =Career= Barcianu had difficulty securing employment as a teacher or church administrator, and refused an offer from the Romanian Old Kingdom's University of Bucharest, stating he was needed in Transylvania. It was only in late 1875 that he found work as a secretary at the Sibiu-based Astra; the job paid less than his student scholarship. As such, he worked to establish a girls' school, which he headed from 1876 to 1887. In 1876, he was named professor at the theological-pedagogical institute, remaining there until 1901. In the theological wing, he taught Romanian language and literature from 1877 onward, with the exception of the year he spent in prison. In the pedagogical section, he taught Romanian language as well as zoology, botany and mineralogy. He set up a natural science room featuring stuffed animals, plants and minerals.PƒÉcurariu, p. 249 In 1901, upon the recommendation of Metropolitan Ioan Me»õianu, the Sibiu Archdiocese elected him cultural adviser, charged with supervising the archdiocese's schools. He managed to found several school libraries and embarked on inspections in order to assess the state of education. Taken ill after one such visit to a village near Sibiu, he died in early 1903, aged 55.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 249-50 =Transylvanian Memorandum and cultural activity= Barcianu's publications included textbooks and works on pedagogy, as well as new editions of his father's writings. In 1876-1877, together with several colleagues, he edited a literary supplement to Telegraful Rom√¢n that promoted phonetic spelling. In 1891, he edited a popular literary and scientific newspaper on his own, while in 1897-1900, he edited Foaia pedagogicƒÉ in collaboration. He contributed articles to Telegraful Rom√¢n and, from 1884, to Tribuna.PƒÉcurariu, p. 250 He again served as secretary at Astra from 1881 to 1887, and from 1889 to 1901 headed the Romanian teachers' association of Szeben County. Active in several other societies, Barcianu was long a lay member of the archdiocesan synod, where he notably spoke in 1900 regarding proposals for a new cathedral.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 250-51 Together with his friend and colleague Dimitrie Com»ôa, Barcianu belonged to the leadership of the Romanian National Party, and as such helped draft the 1892 Transylvanian Memorandum. As a result, he was among those collectively tried in May 1894. Sentenced to two and a half years in prison, he was held at V√°c until a general amnesty was granted in September 1895. Barcianu married Silvia Olteanu in 1882. She died in 1902, and after her husband's death the following year, the couple's four sons and two daughters were raised by his sister.PƒÉcurariu, p. 251 Notes References *Mircea PƒÉcurariu, CƒÉrturari sibieni de altƒÉdatƒÉ.

With musical influences changing in the late 1960s, the Four Seasons teamed up with Jake Holmes to create a concept album that placed their traditional pop stylings into the psychedelic era. Instead of love songs, the group tackled subjects such as war and racial tension. The album's packaging was also distinctive, with the cover being stylized as a newspaper and the sleeve containing an eight-page newspaper-like insert that also had specially-done color underground comics strips by Skip Williamson and Jay Lynch. This unique packaging inspired John Lennon and the band Jethro Tull to use the concept for later albums of their own. The first single issued 7 months before the album's release (5/68) was \\"Saturday's Father\\" (Philips 40542). It only bubbled under at #103 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.

The aircraft was transporting the Brazilian Chapecoense football squad and their entourage from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, to Medell√≠n, where the team was scheduled to play at the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals. One of the four crew members, three of the players, and two other passengers survived with injuries. The official report from Colombia's civil aviation agency, Aerocivil, found the causes of the crash to be fuel exhaustion due to an inappropriate flight plan by the airline, and pilot error regarding poor decision making as the situation worsened, including a failure to declare an emergency after fuel levels became critically low, thus failing to inform air traffic control at Medellin that a priority landing was required.  Background  = Aircraft and operator = The aircraft was an Avro RJ85, registration CP-2933, serial number E.2348, which first flew in 1999. After service with other airlines and a period in storage between 2010 and 2013, it was acquired by LaMia, a Venezuelan-owned airline operating out of Bolivia. = Crew = The captain was 36-year-old Miguel Quiroga, who had been a former Bolivian Air Force (FAB) pilot and had previously flown for EcoJet, which also operated the Avro RJ85. He joined LaMia in 2013 and at the time of the accident he was one of the airline's co-owners as well as a flight instructor. Quiroga had logged a total of 6,692 flight hours, including 3,417 hours on the Avro RJ85. The first officer was 47-year-old Fernando Goytia, who had also been a former FAB pilot. He received his type rating on the Avro RJ85 five months before the accident and had had 6,923 flight hours, with 1,474 of them on the Avro RJ85. Another flight crew member was 29-year-old Sisy Arias, who was undergoing training and was an observer in the cockpit. She had been interviewed by TV before the flight.  Flight and crash  The planned (blue) and actual (red) itineraries from S√£o Paulo to Medell√≠n. The party flew with a different airline from S√£o Paulo to Santa Cruz, where it boarded the LaMia aircraft. The refuelling stop at Cobija was cancelled following a late departure from Santa Cruz. Recovery of bodies The aircraft was carrying 73 passengers and 4 crew members on a flight from Viru Viru International Airport, in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, to Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport, serving Medell√≠n in Colombia, and located in nearby Rionegro. Among the passengers were 22 players of the Brazilian Associa√ß√£o Chapecoense de Futebol club, 23 staff, 21 journalists and 2 guests. The team was travelling to play their away leg of the Final for the 2016 Copa Sudamericana in Medell√≠n against Atl√©tico Nacional. =Background and transit to Bolivia= Chapecoense's initial request to charter LaMia for the whole journey from S√£o Paulo to Medell√≠n was refused by the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil because of freedom of the air reasons and bilateral agreements under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules, which would have required the use of a Brazilian or Colombian airline for such service. The club opted to retain LaMia and arranged a flight with Boliviana de Aviaci√≥n from S√£o Paulo to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, where it was to board the LaMia flight. LaMia had previously transported other teams for international competitions, including Chapecoense and the Argentina national team, which had flown on the same aircraft two weeks before. The flight from S√£o Paulo landed at Santa Cruz at 16:50 local time. =Flight from Santa Cruz= The RJ85 operating LaMia flight 2933 departed Santa Cruz at 18:18 local time. A Chapecoense team member's request to have a video game retrieved from his luggage in the aircraft's cargo delayed departure. The original flight plan included an intermediate refueling stop at the Cobija‚ÄìCaptain An√≠bal Arab Airport, near Bolivia's border with Brazil; however, the flight's late departure meant the aircraft would not arrive at Cobija prior to the airport's closing time. An officer of Bolivia's (AASANA ‚Äì Airports and Air Navigation Services Administration) at Santa Cruz de la Sierra reportedly rejected the crew's flight plan for a direct flight to Medell√≠n several times despite pressure to approve it, because of the aircraft's range being almost the same as the flight distance. The flight plan was altered to include a refueling stop in Bogot√° instead and was approved by another AASANA officer. The distance between Santa Cruz and Medell√≠n airports is . A fuel stop in Cobija would have broken the flight into two segments: an initial segment of to Cobija followed by a flight of to Medell√≠n, a total of . Bogot√°'s airport is from Santa Cruz's airport and from Medell√≠n's. Despite the altered flight plan, the refueling stop in Bogot√° was never made, and the flight proceeded directly from Santa Cruz to Medell√≠n. Under standard conditions, the RJ85 has a range of approximately with a payload of . Using the International Air Transport Association estimate for weight of passengers and luggage of per person, the aircraft's payload is estimated at meaning a flight from Santa Cruz to Medell√≠n would be at the limit of the aircraft's range. Shortly before 22:00 local time on 28 November (03:00 UTC, 29 November), the pilot of the LaMia aircraft reported an electrical failure and fuel exhaustion while flying in Colombian airspace between the municipalities of La Ceja and La Uni√≥n. The RJ85 had begun its descent from its cruising altitude at 21:30. Another aircraft had been diverted to Medell√≠n from its planned route (from Bogot√° to San Andres) by its crew because of a suspected fuel leak. Medell√≠n air traffic controllers gave that aircraft priority to land and at 21:43 the LaMia RJ85's crew was instructed to enter a racetrack-shaped holding pattern at the Rionegro VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) radio navigation beacon and wait with three other aircraft for its turn to land. The crew requested and were given authorisation to hold at an area navigation (RNAV) waypoint named GEMLI, about south of the Rionegro VOR. While waiting for the other aircraft to land, during the last 15 minutes of its flight, the RJ85 completed two laps of the holding pattern. This added approximately to its flight path. At 21:49, the crew requested priority for landing because of unspecified \\"problems with fuel\\", and were told to expect an approach clearance in \\"approximately seven minutes\\". Minutes later, at 21:52, they declared a fuel emergency and requested immediate descent clearance and \\"vectors\\" for approach. At 21:53, with the aircraft nearing the end of its second lap of the holding pattern, engines 3 and 4 (the two engines on the right wing) flamed out due to fuel exhaustion; engines 1 and 2 flamed out two minutes later, at which point the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped operating. After the LaMia crew reported the RJ85's electrical and fuel problems, an air traffic controller radioed that the aircraft was from the Rionegro VOR, but its altitude data were no longer being received. The crew replied that the aircraft was at an altitude of ; the procedure for an aircraft approaching to land at Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport states it must be at an altitude of at least when passing over the Rionegro VOR. Air traffic control radar stopped detecting the aircraft at 21:55 local time as it descended among the mountains south of the airport. At 21:59 the aircraft hit the crest of a ridge on a mountain known as Cerro Gordo at an altitude of while flying in a northwesterly direction, with the wreckage of the rear of the aircraft on the southern side of the crest and other wreckage coming to rest on the northern side of the crest adjacent to the Rionegro VOR transmitter facility, which is in line with runway 01 at Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport and about from the southern end.  Rescue  Helicopters from the Colombian Air Force were initially unable to get to the site because of heavy fog in the area, while first aid workers arrived two hours after the crash to find debris strewn across an area about in diameter. It was not until 02:00 on 29 November that the first survivor arrived at a hospital: Alan Ruschel, one of the Chapecoense team members. Six people were found alive in the wreckage. The last survivor to be found was footballer Neto who was discovered at 05:40. Chapecoense backup goalkeeper Jakson Follmann underwent a potentially life-saving leg amputation. 71 of the 77 occupants died as a result of the crash. The number of dead was initially thought to be 75, but it was later revealed that four people had not boarded the aircraft. Colombian Air Force personnel extracted the bodies of 71 victims from the wreckage and took them to an air force base. They were then taken to the Instituto de Medicina Legal in Medell√≠n for identification.  Investigation  =Colombian crash investigation= Graphs of flight altitude and airspeed from Santa Cruz until the engine flameouts and consequent loss of electrical power stopped the FDR recording The Grupo de Investigaci√≥n de Accidentes A√©reos (GRIAA) investigation group of Colombia's (UAEAC or Aerocivil ‚Äì Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics) began investigating the accident and requested assistance from BAE Systems (the successor company to British Aerospace, the aircraft‚Äôs manufacturer) and the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) as the investigative body of the state of the manufacturer. A team of three AAIB accident investigators was deployed. They were joined by investigators from Bolivia's national aviation authority, the (DGAC ‚Äì General Directorate of Civil Aviation). In all, twenty-three specialists were deployed on the investigation; in addition to ten Colombian investigators and those from Bolivia and the United Kingdom, Brazil and the United States contributed personnel to the investigation. On the afternoon of 29 November the UAEAC reported that both flight recorders - the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) - had been recovered undamaged. Evidence very quickly emerged to suggest that the aircraft had run out of fuel: the flight attendant who survived the accident reported that the captain's final words were \\"there is no fuel\\", and transmissions to that effect from the pilots to ATC were overheard by crews of other aircraft, and recorded in the control tower. Shortly after the crash, the person leading the investigation stated that there was \\"no evidence of fuel in the aircraft\\" and the aircraft did not catch fire when it crashed. Analysis of the FDR showed all four engines flamed out a few minutes before the crash. Four weeks after the crash the investigation confirmed that the cause of the crash was fuel exhaustion. Poor planning by the airline and poor oversight by aviation authorities in Bolivia were cited as contributory factors. Analysis by Aerocivil found that the total fuel on board was less than the mandated endurance fuel load, which legally requires: the amount required for taxi before takeoff; plus the amount required for the basic estimated time enroute at a particular altitude and onboard weight; plus allowance for extended holding patterns; plus allowance for diversions to secondary airports; plus allowance for aborted initial landing with go-around and second attempt. The investigation found that LaMia had consistently operated its fleet without the legally required endurance fuel load, and had simply been lucky to avoid any of the delays that the mandated fuel load were meant to allow for. Due to restrictions imposed by the aircraft not being compliant with reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) regulations, the submitted flight plan, with a nominated cruising flight level (FL) higher than 280 (approximately in altitude), was in violation of protocols. The flight plan, which was approved by AASANA, included a cruising altitude of FL300 (approximately ). The flight plan was sent for review to Colombian and Brazilian authorities as well, in accordance with regional regulations. The aircraft was estimated to be overloaded by nearly . The preliminary accident report stated the CVR had recorded the pilots discussing their fuel state and possible fuel stops en route, but they were so accustomed to operating with minimal fuel that they decided against a fuel stop when ATC happened to assign them an adjustment in their route which saved a few minutes of flight time. For unknown reasons, the CVR stopped recording an hour and forty minutes before the FDR, when the aircraft was still about away from the crash site at the Rionegro VOR. Aviation analyst John Nance and GRIAA investigators Julian Echeverri and Miguel Camacho would later suggest that the most probable explanation is that the flight's captain, who was also a part owner of LaMia, pulled the circuit breaker on the CVR to prevent a record of the subsequent discussions, knowing that the flight did not have the appropriate fuel load. =Findings in the final report= On 27 April 2018, the investigators, led by Aerocivil, released the final investigative report for the crash of Flight 2933, listing the following causal factors: *The airline inappropriately planned the flight without considering the necessary amount of fuel that would be needed to fly to an alternate airport, fuel reserves, contingencies, or the required minimum fuel to land; *The four engines shut down in sequence as a result of fuel exhaustion; *Poor decision making by LaMia employees \\"as a result of processes that failed to ensure operational security\\"; *Poor decision making by the flight crew, who continued the flight on extremely limited fuel despite being aware of the low fuel levels aboard the aircraft and who did not take corrective actions to land the aircraft and refuel. Additional contributing factors cited by the investigators were: *Deploying the landing gear early; *\\"Latent deficiencies\\" in the planning and execution of non-regular flights related to the insufficient supply of fuel; *Specific deficiencies in the planning of the flight by LaMia; *\\"Lack of supervision and operational control\\" by LaMia, which did not supervise the planning of the flight or its execution, nor did it provide advice to the flight crew; *Failure to request priority or declare an emergency by the flight crew, particularly when fuel exhaustion became imminent; these actions would have allowed air traffic services to provide the necessary attention; *Failure by the airline to follow the fuel management rules that the Bolivian DGAC had approved in certifying the company; *Delays in CP-2933's approach to the runway resulting from its late declaration of priority and of fuel emergency, added to dense traffic in the R√≠onegro VOR area. =Other investigations and disciplinary measures= Ten days after the crash, on 8 December, an investigative report by Spanish- language American media company Univision, using data from the Flightradar24 website, claimed that the airline had broken the fuel and loading regulations of the International Civil Aviation Organization on 8 of its 23 previous flights since 22 August. This included two direct flights from Medell√≠n to Santa Cruz: one on 29 October transporting Atl√©tico Nacional to the away leg of their Copa Sudamericana semifinal, and a flight without passengers on 4 November. The report claimed the eight flights would have used at least some of the aircraft's mandatory fuel reserves (a variable fuel quantity to allow for an additional 45 minutes of flying time), concluding the company was accustomed to operating flights at the limit of the RJ85's endurance. After the crash, the Bolivian government suspended the director of the DGAC and the chief executive of AASANA as well as the director of the DGAC‚Äôs National Aeronautics Registry‚Äîthe son of one of LaMia's owners. Bolivian criminal investigation A week after the crash, Bolivian police detained two individuals on criminal charges related to the crash of Flight 2933. The general director of LaMia was detained on various charges, including involuntary manslaughter. His son, who worked for the DGAC, was detained for allegedly using his influence to have the aircraft be given an operational clearance. A prosecutor involved with the case told reporters that \\"the prosecution has collected statements and evidence showing the participation of the accused in the crimes of misusing influence, conduct incompatible with public office and a breach of duties.\\" An arrest warrant was issued for the employee of AASANA in Santa Cruz who had refused to approve Flight 2933's flight plan - it was later approved by another official. She fled the country seeking political asylum in Brazil, claiming that after the crash she had been pressured by her superiors to alter a report she had made before the aircraft took off and that she feared that Bolivia would not give her a fair trial. A warrant was also issued for the arrest of another of LaMia's co-owners, but he still had not been located four weeks after the crash. In May 2017, a CNN report revealed that LaMia's insurance policy with Bolivian insurer Bisa had lapsed beginning in October 2016 for nonpayment; while said policy did not cover flights to Colombia, which the insurer included as part of a geographical exclusion clause along with several African countries, as well as Peru, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, the airline managed to get permission to fly to Colombia on at least eight occasions.  Reactions  = Governmental = Brazilian and Mercosur flags at half staff at the National Congress Building in Bras√≠lia Following the crash, the DGAC of Bolivia suspended LaMia's air operator's certificate. LaMia's remaining two RJ85s were impounded. A few days after the crash, Bolivia's Defense Minister expressed concern over the possibility of aviation sanctions and downgrades by foreign national aviation authorities, for which consequences may include banning Bolivian carriers from foreign airspace. Brazilian President Michel Temer declared three days of national mourning and requested that personnel from Brazil's embassy to Colombia in Bogot√° be moved to Medell√≠n to better assist the survivors and the families of the victims. = Sports = A vigil attended by thousands was held in Chapec√≥, the hometown of Chapecoense minute of silence observed before a football match in San Crist√≥bal, Venezuela Many South American football teams paid tribute to Chapecoense by changing their playing kits to include Chapecoense's badge or wearing Chapecoense's playing kit or green colours. Matches all over the world also began with a minute of silence. CONMEBOL All activities related to CONMEBOL (the South American Football Confederation) were suspended immediately, including both legs of the Copa Sudamericana final, scheduled for and 7 December, and the second leg of the Copa do Brasil Final. Atl√©tico Nacional, Chapecoense's opponents-to-be in the final, asked CONMEBOL to honor Chapecoense by awarding them the Copa Sudamericana title, stating that \\"for our part, and forever, Chapecoense are champions of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana\\". CONMEBOL officially named Chapecoense the 2016 Copa Sudamericana champions on 5 December. The Brazilian team received the winner's prize money (US $2 million) and was awarded qualification to the 2017 Copa Libertadores, 2017 Recopa Sudamericana against Atl√©tico Nacional and the 2017 Suruga Bank Championship against J1 League champions Urawa Red Diamonds. Atl√©tico Nacional also received the CONMEBOL Centennial Fair Play Award in recognition of its sportsmanship in suggesting that Chapecoense be awarded the title. FIFA FIFA president Gianni Infantino gave a speech at Arena Cond√°, Chapecoense's stadium, at a public memorial. A committee representing FIFA at the service was composed of former football legends Clarence Seedorf and Carles Puyol; and Real Madrid player Lucas Silva. Infantino gave his speech at the end of the service by saying: \\"Today we are all Brazilians, we are all Chapecoenses\\". Nacional were awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award for requesting the Copa Sudamerica title to be awarded to Chapecoense. UEFA UEFA officially asked for a minute's silence at all upcoming Champions League and Europa League matches as a mark of respect. President Aleksander Ceferin said in a statement: \\"European football is united in expressing its deepest sympathy to Chapecoense, the Brazilian football confederation, CONMEBOL and the families of all the victims following this week's air disaster\\". National football associations The Argentine Football Association sent a support letter to Chapecoense offering free loans of players from Argentine clubs. The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) encouraged Chapecoense to play its next scheduled Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A game against Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro, part of the final round of the tournament, as a tribute to the players. Both Chapecoense and Atl√©tico Mineiro refused to play the match, but they were not fined by the Superior Court of Sports Justice. Besides changing their profile pictures on social media to a black version of Chapecoense's badge and issuing messages of solidarity, other Brazilian teams offered to loan the club players for the next year and asked the CBF to exempt Chapecoense from relegation for the next three years. In Colombia, a four-hour tribute took place at Atl√©tico Nacional's stadium at the time the match Chapecoense had been scheduled to play would have kicked off. This was attended by 40,000 spectators with live coverage on Fox Sports and a live stream on YouTube. The Uruguayan Football Association declared two days of mourning. The association's referees wore a Chapecoense badge on their shirts for the 14th matchday of the Uruguayan Primera Divisi√≥n. = Other = Avianca, Colombia's flag carrier and largest airline, provided 44 psychologists to help in the counseling of the families of the victims. The airline, by request of the Colombian and Brazilian governments, also provided logistical support and transportation to Brazilian medical personnel who were involved in the identification of the deceased. On Twitter, Avianca expressed its regrets over the incident and stated that \\"our prayers are with the families of the victims\\". Two weeks after the crash on 15 December, LaMia's lawyer announced that the airline had agreed with the International Civil Aviation Organization to a compensation scheme that would pay US$165,000 to each deceased passenger's family. LaMia's liability coverage insured up to a maximum of $25 million for passengers and $1.5 million for crew members. During an interview, Roberto Canessa, a member of a Uruguayan rugby team that was travelling to a match in 1972 when their aircraft crashed in what became known as the Andes flight disaster, said that he wanted to help the crash survivors. Spanish club FC Barcelona offered to play a friendly fundraiser, in order to help rebuild Chapecoense's team. The match was played on 7 August 2017 at Barcelona's stadium, which Barcelona subsequently won 5‚Äì0. Alan Ruschel, one of the three surviving players, played his first game since the tragedy. He started the game as the captain, and was substituted in the 35th minute. In all copies of FIFA 17, players were given the Chapecoense emblem for free to wear for their FIFA Ultimate Team Club.  Survivors  The surviving players were Alan Ruschel, Jakson Follmann and Neto. The other survivors were a flight attendant and two passengers. One of the surviving passengers, an employee of a Bolivian company contracted by LaMia to provide maintenance technicians to accompany the aircraft, said that there was no announcement by the pilots that there was an emergency and he thought the aircraft was simply descending prior to the crash. Chapecoense goalkeeper Danilo was initially reported to have survived the crash and to have been taken to a hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries. However, the San Vicente Fundaci√≥n hospital from Medell√≠n clarified a few days later that he died in the crash. Brazilian radio personality Rafael Henzel, who was a passenger on the flight and the only journalist to survive, died on 26 March 2019 after a heart attack.Morre Rafael Henzel, sobrevivente da trag√©dia com o avi√£o da Chapecoense  Notable fatalities  = Chapecoense players = * Ailton Cesar Junior Alves da Silva (Canela), 22 * Dener Assun√ß√£o Braz (Dener), 25 * Marcelo Augusto Mathias da Silva (Marcelo), 25 * Matheus Bitencourt da Silva (Matheus Biteco), 21 * Mateus Lucena dos Santos (Caramelo), 22 * Guilherme Gimenez de Souza (Gimenez), 21 * Lucas Gomes da Silva (Lucas Gomes), 26 * Everton Kempes dos Santos Gon√ßalves (Kemps), 34 * Arthur Brasiliano Maia (Arthur Maia), 24 * Ananias Eloi Castro Monteiro (Ananias), 27 * Marcos Danilo Padilha (Danilo), 31 * Filipe Jos√© Machado (Filipe Machado), 32 * S√©rgio Manoel Barbosa Santos (S√©rgio Manuel), 27 * Jos√© Gildeixon Clemente de Paiva (Gil), 29 * Bruno Rangel Domingues (Bruno Rangel), 34 * Cl√©ber Santana Loureiro (Cl√©ber Santana), 35 * Josimar Rose da Silva Tavares (Josimar), 30 * William Thiego de Jesus (Thiego), 30 * Tiago da Rocha Vieira Alves (Tiaguinho), 22 = Chapecoense staff = * Luiz Carlos Saroli (Caio J√∫nior), coach, 51 = Media = * M√°rio S√©rgio Pontes de Paiva, Fox Sports commentator, former national team player and manager, 66 * Paulo Julio Clement, Fox Sports, 51 * Victorino Chermont, Fox Sports, 43 = Guests = * Delfim de P√°dua Peixoto Filho (Delfim Peixoto), Brazilian Football Confederation former vice-president, 75  In popular culture  The United States cable TV network ESPN produced an hour long story about the crash for its E:60 news magazine TV show.

They were built from 1930 to 1950. They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The school was founded as Rudd's College in 1902 at Clayfield by A.W. Rudd. In 1918 it was taken over by the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association and renamed Brisbane Boys' College. The main three-storeyed masonry school building, was built in 1930 at Toowong, on land donated by the daughters of Sir Robert Philp. Opened in 1931, the school with its boarding facilities was contained in one building. The building was designed by architects Atkinson and Conrad, who were also responsible for the design of The Southport School -1928, and the Church of England Grammar School at East Brisbane 1917‚Äì1930. Another storey was added to the main tower by 1950. The verandahs of the main building were enclosed to provide further accommodation but were opened again in 1989. The headmaster's residence was built in 1936. It also was designed by Atkinson & Conrad. The school has continued to grow and now consists of numerous other buildings with an enrolment of over 1000 students.  Description  Main Building rises above the other buildings when viewed from Moggill Road, 2014 Sited slightly below the ridge of Kensington Terrace, the main building is a three-storeyed rendered masonry Spanish Mission style building. Classroom wings with terracotta tiled hipped roofs flank a central entrance, tower, and campanile. It has concrete floors, timber doors, steel hopper windows to the upper storeys, red brick sills, and rich decorative features to the facades and interior. Door to the tower with the round balconette above, 2014 Seen from Moggill Road, the building rises above surrounding vegetation and roofs, being the most prominent building on the hillside. From within the school grounds, it dominates views up the hill from the north to the east, the campanile in particular being consistently visible. The neighbouring school buildings have been limited in height, preserving the vistas to and from the building. The main entrance to the school is located on the northern frontage, which is two storeyed and divided into five bays. The central bay is gabled and features the main entrance doorway; the doorway is arched and set in a decorated rectangular frame. The two bays which flank the central entrance bays are arcaded with verandahs above, while the two outer bays have paired arched windows and tiled awnings. The southern frontage, which overlooks the hillside, is three-storeyed, and also has five bays. The central bay, containing the chapel, extends out from the building, and has a hipped roof, with a small gable to the south. The tower behind rises another two storeys above the chapel, and has a pyramid roof. The flat-roofed campanile rises above the tower, and has an entrance at its base with a small round balconette above. The chapel has large arched windows with smaller arched windows above. The bays flanking the chapel and campanile are arcaded up to the second storey. Decorative features to both frontages include gargoyles, twisted columns between arched windows and to principal doorways, and arched cornices to gables, the tower and the campanile. A three-storeyed annex extends to the north-east, sitting a half a storey below the rest of the building; it has a hipped roof, rectangular windows, tiled awnings to the south and a timber porch to the north. Notable features of the interior include timber panelling and two stained glass windows, one depicting the arts, the other, the sciences, in the main entrance foyer. The chapel has a stained glass window to the south. The headmaster's residence is an asymmetrical gabled composition in matching materials to the main building. It has three gables to the north, two timber-lined, with a smaller gable over the entrance, and is situated above an escarpment to the north of the main building.  Heritage listing  Brisbane Boys' College Buildings were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Brisbane Boys' College, Toowong, is significant historically for its association with the work of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches in the provision of education for boys in Queensland since 1918. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The main building demonstrates the principal characteristics of a substantial school building in the interwar Spanish Mission style, and the Headmaster's Residence is a good example of an interwar rendered masonry house. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place is important for its aesthetic values, in particular the accomplished design in the composition of forms and detailing of the main building, which is also a prominent local landmark. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has social significance as the alma mater of the sons of thousands of Protestant families in Queensland. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

He stepped down from this position on 3 May 2017 having been selected as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party (UK) for the Sittingbourne and Sheppey constituency at the snap general election that took place on Thursday 8 June 2017. However, despite an 11% swing to Labour and a 62% increase in votes for Labour compared to 2015, Rolfe failed to be elected and finished in second place to the sitting Conservative MP, Gordon Henderson (politician) who was re-elected with a majority of 15,211 votes. In August 2019, it was recorded in the press that Rolfe had resigned from the Labour Party citing Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs Brexit policy as his main reasons.https://www.kentonline.co.uk/sheerness/news/labour-party-candidate- quits-in-brexit-row-210848/ Born 25 January 1978 in Barnehurst, South London, son of council worker David Frederick Rolfe (deceased) and retired Secretary Dorothy Jane Mungeam (Rolfe), aged 38 years at the time of taking over as the National Chair of the POA, he was one of the youngest trade union leaders in the United Kingdom. Rolfe attended Barnes Cray Primary School from 1983-1989, followed by Erith Secondary School in South London from 1989-1994 before attending Bexley College to complete A-Levels. In 1996, Rolfe started his working career, training to become an accountant and progressing quickly as he earned a reputation for hard work, dedication and commitment. However, following his father's premature death aged 57 in 2002, Rolfe quit his job; pursuing more menial employment and became a Prison officer at HM Prison Elmley in 2004. Rolfe identifies as a socialist, however he was quick to make clear his views are not entirely left wing in an interview with the Morning Star, clarifying that he does not share the same political ideology of Democratic Socialists such as Jeremy Corbyn. Rolfe first found notoriety amongst his colleagues in the Prison Service when he established the popular Facebook page known as 'Know The Danger,' or 'KTD' abbreviated, in May 2013 at a point in which major restructuring took place within the Prison system. These changes have been heavily criticised and attributed to the current systematic failures within the UK Prison Service, manifesting in the worst reported riots in 25 years during 2016. Rolfe became a prominent figure during the latter part of 2016 following a string of appearances on BBC News at Ten and various other news outlets forcing the Secretary of State for Justice Elizabeth Truss to concede \\"serious issues\\" that would take time to resolve within the Prison estate. Mike Rolfe founded the Criminal Justice Workers Union or (CJWU) on the 6th April 2020 to offer a modern and enterprising alternative to traditional trade unions for workers in the Criminal Justice Sector. The CJWU has quickly gained members in numerous workplaces throughout the UK, with over 500 members to have reported joining in the first few weeks. Prior to standing as a Labour Party Candidate in the 2017 General Election, Rolfe stood in the 2013 Kent County Council elections for TUSC in the constituency of Sheppey, finishing 5th with 2% of the overall vote share.

History  The clocktower at the entrance of the fortress The house of the municipality within the fortress The origins of the castle date to reign of King D. Sancho I, around 1189.Sousa (1989) At that time, the castle was settled and donated to D. Gualdim Pais, Master of the Order of the Temple (Knights Templar), resulting in the establishment of a fortification on a pre- existing castro. Its construction dates from this period (or following the donation) when the fortification's courtyard was begun, similar to other Templar donations, the site had a military significance associated with a period of colonization or defense. Contemporary excavations in the Cimo da Vila area have still not affirmatively indicated its period of occupation. It was A foral (charter) was conceded to Penamacor in 1199 by King D. Sancho I, which was ratified in 1209, following the similar model of √Åvila/√âvora. It was likely during this period that the castle was ordered built by D. Sancho I. The second line walls, the keep tower and urban circus was also expanded in 1300 during the reign of King D. Denis. Little remains of the early medieval castle, and those remnants that do date to the period of the early Middle Ages, during the monarchy of King D. Dinis, when the walls and significant keep tower were constructed. Meanwhile, the barbican and other elements date from the reigns of King D. Ferdinand I and King D. John I, between the late 13th century and early 14th century. In 1379, the couto was instituted. In the 15th century, King D. Afonso V created the countship of Penamacor, bestowing it on D. Lopo de Albuquerque. The 1496 Inquiri√ß√£o (Inquiries) refers to the existence of 389 inhabitant on the site. The principal element was the 16th century keep tower, erroneously identified as a Torre de Vigia (lookout tower) by Landeiro (1982) and systematically characterized by other authors.Landeiro (1982), p.27 Constructed in the reign of King D. Manuel, the rectangular structure included an elevated entrance over the ground with staircase. It was uniformly crowned by balcony with machicolations, a military solution which was relatively rare in Portugal, influenced by interventions in this century, and designed by local master mason Jo√£o de Ortega, who added two circular corbels. Drawings by Duarte de Armas between 1509-1510, represent the walls around the settlement as an irregular polygon, that accompanied the contours of the terrain. The design also included an adarve decorated with merlons in the north, and a lower curtain of ruined exterior walls. The castle was situated on the extreme east, projected to the exterior. Opposite to this, and on the outside of the walls, is an isolated rectangular tower (the lookout tower) surmounted by merlons. Addorsed to the town wall is a \\"U\\"-shaped barbican that partially includes in the south, west and north, followed by protected adarves with merlons and cruciform bombardments with cylindrical corbels with slits on the northwestern and northeastern angles. Entrance to the structure came from the western wall, under an arched doorway. The Irregular castle plan included walls decorated with merlons to the keep tower in the southeast. This structure was marked by, as the author intonated \\"it was not finished at the time I saw it and was at a height of 14 varas and a half\\". The interior of the courtyard was filled with three oversized two- storey spaces, surrounded by patios (one with a cistern). In the 1527 Numeramento (ecclesiastical survey) the population of the castle included 864 inhabitants. In 1568, the Casa da C√¢mara building was accessible from the gate overlooking the town. It had two halls, one for sessions and another for scribes. In 1500, though, the civil registry office burned down. By the middle of the 17th century, renovation of the defensive structures were undertaken during the context of the Portuguese Restoration Wars, being Military Governor of Beiras, Marquess of Castelo Melhor, who initiated work on the construction of six bastions. Alterations to the residence occurred in the 18th century, that included repairs to the castle in 1719, by Manuel Pinto Vilalobos. But, in 1739, the keep tower was obliterated following an accident, when it was being used as a powder magazine. In addition to the keep, several of the buildings in the interior courtyard were damaged. This, as an infantry regiment was stationed on site. The 1758 Mem√≥rias Paroquiais indicated that Penamacor was the possession of the King, and described the castle as including a southern tower, the palace of the \\"king\\" in the east, in addition to municipal hall and jailhouse, both accessible by the exterior wall with clock tower. Signed by the vicar Asc√™nsio de Carvalho, the Mem√≥rias indicated that the walls were built of simple, single stone, with six bastions and with two gates: the Carros in the east and the Santo Ant√≥nio in the west. A later revision, signed by prior of the parish of Santa Maria, Manuel da Gama Reixa, the Penamacor castle was referred as having walls in ruins in two areas: right of the gate, provoked by a storm, and along the tower, following a violent fire, caused by an explosion. In addition, it referred to a triangular square and a niche in the archway of the gate, with a painting of Senhora do P√© da Cruz. Further damage was evidenced in 1762. By the 19th century, the castle had 5 bastions functioning and principal gate that was situated by the municipal palace/hall, named the Gate of Santo Ant√≥nio, which followed the walls along the avenue, to the Gate of Monturo dos Negros. The walls followed the locality and garrison to the keep tower, the actual clock tower. From the tower, a curtain of walls extended to the old municipal hall and the Po√ßo de El-Rei, situated a few metres from the lookout tower. From here, the walls extended to the Church S√£o Jo√£o, where the Gate of Carros was located, followed by the post of the fiscal guard, passing through the Cavaleira with vestiges of the redoubt. The walls then climbed along the Rua do Outeiro' until the Gate of Santo Ant√≥nio that was constituted of outer neighbourhoods. In 1834, the military garrison was removed from the castle, thus initiating a progressive destruction of the walls, whose materials were being reused for various construction projects in the municipality. An attempt to catalogue the site was initiated in 1853, by Engineer, Captain Joaquim Ant√≥nio Dias. But, in 1867, the Gate of Santo Ant√≥nio was demolished and the stone acquired by the municipality for 60$000 r√©is. A new municipal clock tower was constructed for 100$000 r√©is by Ces√°rio Correia da Silva, and using a 115$325 r√©is bell, by Jos√© Ant√≥nio Linhares of Ourondo (who acquired the older bell). On 30 October 1874, Baltasar Pereira da Silva requested permission to remove stone from the bastion, resulting in the extraction of 30 carts of stone and debris. Similarly, on 17 July 1886, the stone from the Gate of Monturo dos Negros (situated alongside the Jardim da Rep√∫blica), was resold and reused for the construction of the avenue and sidewalks of the town. At the beginning of the 20th century, descriptions of the bastions were made by Lieutenant-Colonel J√∫lio Rodrigues da Silva. In 1933, the cistern (or Po√ßo d'El Rei) was filled- in by the municipality. This was a precursor to modernization of the spaces, that included in the installation the Municipal Museum in the old municipal house in 1943, under the initiative of M√°rio Pires Bento, municipal secretary. On 18 May 1973, the Junta Nacional de Educa√ß√£o (National Junta for Education) proposed the classification of the site as a national monument. On 8 August 1973, a dispatch from the Secretary-of-State for Instruction and Culture () indicated their interest in supporting the reclassification of the site. Archaeological excavations began in September 2003, along the perimeter of the castle by Arqueonova, under the directions of archaeologist Silvina Silv√©rio e Andr√© Teixeira, that continued between July and September 2006, by the same team, that resulted in the discovery of various bones, skeletons and a 15th- century dish, in addition to a false doorway. On 31 October 2012, the decision was published to classify the site as a national monument (Announcement 13641/2012, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 2, 211). Architecture The castle is situated on hilltop, at approximately above sea level, located between the Ribeira de Ceife and the Ribeira de Taliscas, tributaries of the P√¥nsul River (affluent of the Tagus River) along the southern part of Cova da Beira. The castle overlooks much of the frontier of the Serra da Estrela along with the Castle of Monsanto, and includes a clock tower and municipal house, integrated into the walls of the fortress. Nearby is the Church of the Miseric√≥rdia. The urban circus occupies an irregular, ovular track of which only a few segments of the identifiable perimeter still remain: a line without merlons between the House of the C√¢mara and the keep tower, and the section in the southern wall. The Torre de Menagem (keep tower) or clock tower is addorsed to the exterior line of walls that confronts the urban circus. Its regular, rectangular plan includes embrasure, with two blind registers, and a partially-broken arch on the ground floor to the west, surmounted by a base relief image of a knight. The adarve is decorated by pentagonal merlons, integrated in the northeast by a bell/clock tower with pyramidal roof. The clock face is oriented to north. The rectangular lookout tower is three-storey's tall. The eastern facade over embrasure, that succeed the first and third registers, with the second marked by door with curved lintel, surmounted by an unintelligible inscription. The north face with high bilevel embrasure includes royal coat-of-arms, flanked by armilar spheres and framed by rectangular on the upper floor. On the western facade is a similar embrasure, on the second register and a window with straight lintel without frame on the third. The southern facade with similar embrasure, is partial addorsed over rocky outcroppings integrated into the construction, with a decorative adarve with machicolations composed of tripartite corbels. The subsistent bastions, which are contiguous to the House of the C√¢mara, fall along the escarpment curtains, integrated into the canon emplacements (to the north). These are partially integrated into the clifftops, along the south face of the Convent of Santo Ant√≥nio, where the other bastion is located. A fourth bastion, known as the Redoubt of the Cavalaria, is situated in the barracks of the Fiscal Guard (to the north), known as the Redoubt of Outeiro (located alongside the Rua do Outeiro, to the west). The House of the C√¢mara is integrated into the urban circus, erected over the Gate of the Vila near the town pillory. This building is two-storey rectangular plan decorated with cornices and barrels with tiled roof. The northern facade is marked by an arched wall door surmounted by two windows decorated and framed by stone friezes. The coat-of-arms of Penamacor, armillary spheres and Portuguese shield with the date \\"1568\\". The rear facade is broken by a wall doorway with double arch and staircase to the upper areas, which includes door and rectangular window and lintel, flanked by the municipal coat-of-arms and an identical window opposite it.

(LLI), is a subsidiary of JAC Liner Inc. and commenced its own operations back in December 2004. It has operations from Manila to Lucena and Mauban in the province of Quezon, and to the province of Marinduque.  History  JAC Liner started in April 1987 as a sole proprietorship operating two second hand buses along Alabang - Fairview route. The owner's family backyard lot was then became the company's repair shop and head office. When the company were assisted by a Bus Installment Purchase Program (BIPP) in 1988, it gave their way purchase 26 brand new buses and was granted to have additional franchises along EDSA. They later expand their operations to the Southern Tagalog, where it immediately established itself as one of the largest bus company in the country. In December 2004, they establish their own affiliate company Lucena Lines Inc. Named after the city of Lucena, the capital of Quezon province, they establish operations connecting from Manila to Lucena, and all the way to the province of Marinduque with the help of a shipping company, Montenegro Shipping Lines. In 2011, JAC Liner along with Lucena Lines makes the first bus company in the country to offer free Wi-Fi on board service through the help of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT). Along with JAC Liner, Lucena Lines grew and became one of the predominant bus liner in Luzon. As of 2015, the parent, JAC Liner is now the largest bus company in the country in terms of fleet size.  Absorption from former subsidiaries  Lucena Lines now absorbs some bus companies which once bought by JAC Liner and became JAC's subsidiary. However, it soon went to dissolve having JAC Liner in control. The buses from these former subsidiaries are now managed and repainted under the name of Lucena Lines. They were: * Green Star Express Inc. * Laguna Express Inc.  Fleet  A Yutong ZK6107HA unit of Lucena Lines Lucena Lines runs ordinary and air conditioned bus units.

He is a professor at the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). Igor researchers optically active defects in solids, with an overarching goal to identify new generation of ultra-bright solid state quantum emitters. His main contributions include discovery of new color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride as well as development of new methodologies to engineer nanophotonic devices from these materials. Career Igor received his B.Sc. (2005) and M.Sc. (2007) from the department of Materials Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof Yeshayahu Lifshitz. He then moved to Australia to pursue his PhD at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Prof Steven Prawer. During his PhD, Igor studied new color centers in diamond and discovered the brightest single-photon source known at that time. After completion of his PhD in December 2010, Igor moved to Harvard for two years of postdoctoral training in the group of Prof Evelyn Hu. In 2013, he returned to Australia to establish the nanophotonics research group at UTS. Igor was promoted to Associate Professor in 2015 and to a full Professor in 2018. His group explores new quantum emitters in wide bandgap materials and aims to fabricate quantum nanophotonic devices on a single chip for next generation of quantum computing, quantum cryptography and quantum bio-sensing. In 2016 Aharonovich lead his team to discover the first quantum emitters in 2D materials that operates at room temperature based on defects on defects in hBN. Aharonovich co-authored over 150 peer reviewed publications, including one of the most cited reviews on diamond photonics and more recently wrote a road map for solid state single-photon sources. In 2019, Igor co-founded (together with Andrea Armani, Orad Reshef, Mikhail Kats, Rachel Grange, Riccardo Sapienza and Sylvain Gigan) the inaugural online photonics conference - Photonics Online Meetup.

They were often dubbed as \\"Husky Bus\\" or \\"Husky\\" by their passengers, and by several tour blogging sites. Their operations are headed by Biocrest Multi- Purpose Cooperative, a cooperative formed by the officers of Biocrest Corporation and Eleventh Corporation in General Santos City  Etymology and branding  The bus company name literally came from a sled-type of dog that is used in the northern regions, Husky. They use a Siberian Husky dog as their corporate branding with blue and white color scheme, while their buses are categorized by the good characteristics of an Husky such as \\"Loyal\\", \\"Helpful\\" and \\"Trustworthy\\".  History  It started when the officers and employees of Biocrest Corporation and Eleventh Marketing Corporation to organize a transport service company. Thus the formation of Biocrest Multi-Purpose Cooperative and Transport Services, with Biocrest Multi-Purpose Cooperative as its parent company with its function to address the credit and consumer needs of its employees and members. Their Multi-Purpose Cooperative was then granted by the Department of Labor and Employment in 2005 through the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) of Region XII. Although the company's name was Biocrest Multi-Purpose Cooperative and Transport Services, they choose to use the branding \\"Husky Tours\\" with a Siberian Husky as their corporate logo and branding. They debuted the route from General Santos City to Cotabato City via Koronadal City, Tacurong City, Isulan and Shariff Aguak. They started with several coaches made from Almazora Motors. A several Hino RK Cats Eye air- conditioned and ordinary fare units, and some old buses from the defunct KTM Tours which Husky once bought were begun to be used for Husky Tours' operations. By that time, bus companies are afraid to serve the General Santos - Cotabato route due to in-surging conflicts between the government and rebel groups along the mountainous areas of SOCCSKARGEN Region. Thus, only Husky Tours serve the said route up until today. In 2007, Husky Tours operates a lone Zonda YCK6117HG. They became the lone bus company to own a Zonda bus in the Philippines. In 2012, Husky Tours began to dissolve their ordinary-fare buses and stick to their air-conditioned units. At that same year, Chinese bus manufacturer Sunlong was about to expand their sales to the Philippine Market. Husky Tours then ordered several Sunlong SLK6106 and became the first bus company to operate a Sunlong bus in the Philippines. When their orders finally arrive in the Manila from China and in delivery to their headquarters in General Santos, Sunlong uses those Husky Tours buses as their marketing campaign with Sunlong's promotional ads in place at their bus units. In 2015, they ordered 12 bus units from Guilin Daewoo. By the following year, another 12 bus units were ordered from Zhongtong. The new orders pushes them to replace their old units with these new ones.
