She was the largest ship, by a factor of over three on gross tonnage, to be lost at sea.  General characteristics  Stellar Daisy was a single-deck capesize very large ore carrier (VLOC) with an overall length of and a beam of . Fully laden, the vessel drew of water and had a deadweight tonnage of 266,141 tons. Her ten cargo holds had a combined bale capacity of . The gross tonnage of the vessel was 148,431 and net tonnage 44,530. On her last voyage, she had a crew of 24. Like most bulk carriers, Stellar Daisy was propelled by a single low-speed two-stroke diesel engine driving a large fixed pitch propeller. Her 9-cylinder Mitsubishi 9UEC75LSII main engine had an output of at 76 rpm. This gave the vessel a service speed of . The MV Stellar Daisy was classed with the Korean Register of Shipping South-Korean classification society, which surveyed and approved the ship's modifications.  Career  Stellar Daisy was originally built as a very large crude carrier (VLCC) at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagasaki Shipyard & Machinery Works in Nagasaki, Japan. Named Sunrise III, she was laid down on July 23, 1992, launched on February 25, 1993 and delivered to the owners on July 2, 1993. In 1992, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) was amended so that all oil tankers of or above ordered after July 6, 1993 were required to have a double hull in way of cargo tanks to reduce the possibility of oil spill in the event of hull damage. Following several high-profile shipwrecks leading to significant environmental damage, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decided to phase out single-hull oil tankers such as Sunrise III with an accelerated schedule. In 2006, Polaris Shipping Co Ltd, Seoul, purchased four single-hulled oil tankers, including Sunrise III, for conversion to very large ore carriers (VLOC) at Cosco (Zhoushan) Shipyard in China.Stellar Daisy: What went wrong?. Lloyd's List, April 5, 2017. Did conversion contribute to loss of Stellar Daisy? ShipInsight, April 3, 2017. At the time, this was a typical strategy to increase the lifetime of an otherwise obsolete vessel by another 10 to 14 years and, thanks to the high charter rates of large bulk carriers used to transport iron ore to China, the conversion would pay itself back in just one to two years. Typically, the center tanks of the oil tanker would be split into dry cargo holds while the side tanks would be used for ballast or remain empty. Holes cut on the main deck for cargo hatches and coamings would require additional structural strengthening to retain sufficient longitudinal strength after conversion. A tank top strengthened for high loading rate and grab unloading would be fitted above the bottom frames and girders.VLCC to VLOC Conversions. Steamship Mutual, January 2008. The vessel returned to service in 2008 as Stellar Daisy.  Loss  On March 31, 2017, while she was carrying sinter fines (iron ore) across the South Atlantic Ocean from the Vale terminal , near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to China, a loud bang was heard and the ship suddenly began listing. An officer radioed that the ship was taking on water and listing heavily. Very soon the ship sank. Radio contact with the ship, last reported to be from shore, was lost.  Search  Two Filipino crew members were rescued from a liferaft on April 1 by the cargo ship Elpida. The crew members reported that they had seen their ship sink. The other 22 crew members, 14 Filipinos and 8 South Koreans, remain missing. A search for survivors and wreckage was made by Uruguayan, Argentine and Brazilian ships, supported by Brazilian and US aircraft, in a search area of , off the coast of Uruguay. On April 21, the Uruguayan Navy ship ' returned to port after a 17-day search during which floating debris from the wreckage was found. The search continued with six merchant ships.

ShipInsight speculated that the most likely loss for the vessel was linked to her conversion from a tanker to an ore carrier. In February 2017, China Port State Control (PSC) authorities identified six deficiencies, two of which were related to watertight and weathertight doors, during an inspection in Tianjin, China.  Aftermath  Following the sinking of Stellar Daisy, the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners (INTERCARGO) has called for an investigation of the causes leading to the casualty.Intercargo calls for Stellar Daisy probe. Lloyd's List, April 6, 2017. The safety of ore carriers converted from oil tankers in the 2000s has also been questioned.

Only a few days after the loss of Stellar Daisy, another VLOC owned by Polaris Shipping reported structural damage in one of its ballast tanks below waterline, resulting in a small leak. The 280,000-ton vessel, Stellar Unicorn, was built in 1993 as a single-hull oil tanker and converted to an ore carrier in China in 2008.

Investigation and legal proceedings  On January 21, 2019, subsequent to an investigation conducted by the Korean Coast Guard at the request of the South-Korean government, a South-Korean Prosecutor indicted Polaris Shipping Head of Maritime Affairs including a KRS surveyor and two thickness measurement technicians. The heads of Polaris Shipping were charged for not notifying the relevant government body of defects of the hull of the vessel and for their loading method which was allegedly not certified by the Class society. The heads denied those charges. Moreover, the charges were for procedural issues and not for substantial ones. It was alleged by the prosecutor that the thickness measurement company forged the documents which were to prove that their engineers had fulfilled the annual education required by the licensing entity. This charge was not about thickness measurement itself but about their renewal of the license. Moreover, the charge was denied by the thickness measuring company. On January 24, 2019, the court however declined to indict at this stage the CEO of Polaris Shipping, Kim Wan-joong, as well as three other persons who had been signaled in the Korean Coast Guard's investigation, including a KRS surveyor and two thickness measurement technicians of a private company involved in forging annual education license document pertaining to qualification of technician working for thickness measurement company. The court's judge indicated that he may reach additional conclusions after having had the opportunity to review the findings of the undersea exploration which has been recently contracted by the South Korean Government to the US ocean seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity.

The library belongs to the Lobkowicz family, a noble dynasty of Bohemia. Together with the family's collection of artworks, music, and other valuable assets, the library forms the Lobkowicz Collection, most of which is held in the Lobkowicz Palace, part of the Prague Castle complex. The library comprises about 65,000 volumes ‚Äì including 679 manuscripts (114 of them dating to the Middle Ages) and 730 incunabula (early books printed prior to 1501). It is the largest castle library in the Czech Republic. Contents There are a large number of first editions, in subjects ranging from history, geography, medicine and the natural sciences, to architecture, literature, theology and law. Texts are predominantly in French, German and Latin ‚Äì but there are also books in Spanish, Italian, Czech, Greek, Hebrew and other languages. The collection of rare books printed in Spanish is the largest in the country. The oldest complete codex dates to the 10th century, and a four-page fragment of the Gospel of Mark is even older, dating to the late 8th or early 9th century. The Music Archive contains more than 5,000 printed editions and manuscripts of 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century scores, also performing parts, libretti, sheet music, and baroque tablatures for plucked instruments. The Library grew over many centuries, incorporating the libraries of both close and distant relations; the acquisition of the libraries of other aristocrats who fell from favor in the various wars in Central Europe in the 17th century; the purchase of the working libraries of important political, scientific or cultural figures; as well as through regular purchases and commissions.  Early History of the Library  The earliest section is the library of Bohuslav Hassenstein of Lobkowicz, one of the most prominent Latin Humanists of 15th- century Central Europe. With the help of friends and a network of agents, Hassenstein amassed a collection remarkable in its day for its size and scientific approach to collecting and cataloguing. This library was dominated by volumes of classical and humanist philosophy and literature, in Latin, the lingua franca of scholars. Thirty volumes represent nearly half of all the books printed in Greek characters in Europe at that time. The reputation of the collection was such that Hassenstein‚Äôs heirs received requests for loans from Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. About three-quarters of the Hassenstein library survives, and the majority of it in the Lobkowicz Library. A more systematic development of the family collections was started in the 17th century by Zdenƒõk Vojtƒõch, 1st Prince Lobkowicz, who had acquired the Hassenstein library after it was confiscated from his relation, Ji≈ô√≠ of Lobkowicz (1551-1607), who had been charged with plotting against Emperor Rudolf II. After the uprising of the Protestant Estates in 1620, the 1st Prince and his wife, Polyxena (1566-1642) had already succeeded in purchasing entire libraries forfeited by various Protestant aristocratic houses. Other personal libraries were also acquired, including the rare collection of books printed in Spain that came to the country with Polyxena‚Äôs Spanish mother, Maria Manrique de Lara y Mendoza (1538-1608). In this period the library was stored in the palace, then known as Pern≈°tejn Palace, but in 1657 it was moved by the 2nd Prince, V√°clav Eusebius, to Roudnice Castle, where it remained ‚Äì added to by succeeding generations ‚Äì until the Second World War. It is for this reason that the library is known as the Roudnice Lobkowicz Library, even though it is currently kept at Nelahozeves Castle. Ferdinand August (1655-1715), 3rd Prince Lobkowicz, held prestigious offices at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg, and acquired books from the important printing centers in Germany. Documentation exists for hundreds of purchases each year as well as generous payments to bookbinders. His grandson, Ferdinand Philip (1724-1784), 6th Prince Lobkowicz, was a voracious collector of books during his travels throughout Europe. The library was further augmented by collections acquired through inheritance, or marriage into other aristocratic families. The earliest classification system applied to the library was established under V√°clav Eusebius. After 1777, a permanent librarian was always in residence. Ferdinand Josef, 8th Prince (1797-1868) and Mo≈ôic, 9th Prince (1831-1903), authorized a complete reorganization of the library that classified items according to subject in a new 10-volume systematic catalogue and a 20-volume alphabetical catalogue. Imposing bookcases were also made to house the library.  Recent history  The library was confiscated by the Nazis in 1941. The bookcases were broken up and the ruined spaces turned into the communal latrines for the SS training centre that occupied the castle. The books themselves passed to the administrative care of the University Library of Prague. After the Communist takeover in 1948, the collections remained in a state depository, from which volumes and manuscripts were dispersed to different depositories and libraries throughout Bohemia over the next decades. During this time only a very limited number of volumes were available to the public or academic researchers. In 1992, the library was returned to the Lobkowicz family. Shortly thereafter, a private donor made a charitable contribution to re-establish the collection as a working library, based on its original classification and composition, to enable the volumes to be used by scholars in accordance with internationally accepted standards of security and conservation. A new space to house the library in its entirety was prepared at Nelahozeves Castle. The books were again organized according to the order established in the original 19th-century catalogue, a conservation plan for the collection was completed, and a research program was established. As a result, the library is now open, by prior appointment, to students, scholars and special groups. A temporary book exhibition at the palace from 2 July to 30 November 2014 presented rare early editions of English oratorios by George Frideric Handel. The Lobkowicz Library houses a collection of more than twenty volumes of first London editions of Handel's grand oratorios, including a printed score of Esther, regarded as the first large oratorio in English, and a score of the oratorio Deborah, composed in 1733 in response to the success of Esther. Though first editions of the works, both volumes were published posthumously, in 1783 and 1784 respectively. The editions printed by Wright & Wilkinson include a copperplate portrait of Handel by renowned Dutch engraver Jacob Houbraken. The addition of Handel's printed oratorios to the library was thought to be associated with journeys by Ferdinand Philipp, 6th Prince Lobkowicz (1724‚Äì1784) to England. However, more recent research suggests that the rare prints were actually part of the collection of Viennese music patron Gottfried van Swieten. The volumes were most likely purchased together with manuscript copies of Handel's works, including part of the score of the oratorio Messiah, with autograph alterations by Mozart, on display as part of the permanent exhibition.

The subject is Emmett Till, a black 14-year-old boy who was lynched by two white men in Mississippi in 1955. It was one of the works included at the 2017 Whitney Biennial exhibition in New York curated by Christopher Y. Lew and Mia Locks. The painting caused controversy, with protests and calls for the painting's destruction. These may have been merely rhetorical. Protests inside the museum petered out in a day or two. Background and concept Dana Schutz made the painting in August 2016 in response to media coverage of gun violence, in particular, black men being shot by police. The portrait is based, in part, on a photograph of Till's mutilated body‚Äîhis mother had insisted his casket remain open at his funeral to raise awareness of the graphic realities of racism in the U.S.‚Äîwhich was published in The Chicago Defender and Jet magazine. \\"The photograph of Emmett Till felt analogous to the time: what was hidden was now revealed,\\" Schutz told Artnet. The painting was first exhibited in Schutz's fall 2016 solo exhibition, \\"Waiting for the Barbarians,\\" at Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin. In February 2017, Open Casket was one of three of Schutz's paintings selected for inclusion in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Describing the painting in a profile on Schutz for The New Yorker, critic Calvin Tomkins wrote, \\"Measuring thirty-nine by fifty-three inches, it is smaller than most of her recent paintings, and more abstract. The buildup of paint on the face is a couple of inches thick in the area where Till's mouth would be. Although there are no recognizable features, a deep trough carved into the heavy impasto conveys a sense of savage disfigurement, which is heightened by the whiteness of the boy's smoothly ironed dress shirt. His head rests on an ochre-yellow fabric, and deftly brushed colors at the top suggest banked flowers.\\" Response Soon after the opening of the 2017 Whitney Biennial, African-American artist Parker Bright began to silently protest Open Casket by standing in front of the painting wearing a T-shirt with \\"Black Death Spectacle\\" on the back. Artist and writer Hannah Black posted an open letter to the museum's curators and staff to Facebook calling for the painting's removal and recommending its destruction: > I am writing to ask you to remove Dana Schutz's painting Open Casket with > the urgent recommendation that the painting be destroyed and not entered > into any market or museum. As you know, this painting depicts the dead body > of 14-year-old Emmett Till in the open casket that his mother chose, saying, > 'Let the people see what I've seen.' That even the disfigured corpse of a > child was not sufficient to move the white gaze from its habitual cold > calculation is evident daily and in a myriad of ways, not least the fact > that this painting exists at all. In brief: The painting should not be > acceptable to anyone who cares or pretends to care about Black people > because it is not acceptable for a white person to transmute Black suffering > into profit and fun ... These actions led to a conversation in the media on cultural appropriation by white artists. Schutz responded through comments to reporters about how and why the painting was made: > I don't know what it is like to be black in America but I do know what it is > like to be a mother. Emmett was Mamie Till's only son. The thought of > anything happening to your child is beyond comprehension. Their pain is your > pain. My engagement with this image was through empathy with his mother. ... > Art can be a space for empathy, a vehicle for connection. I don't believe > that people can ever really know what it is like to be someone else (I will > never know the fear that black parents may have) but neither are we all > completely unknowable.\\" On the relationship between her painting and the photograph of Till, Schutz reportedly said, \\"The photograph of him in his casket is almost impossible to look at. In making the painting, I relied more on listening to Mamie Till's verbal account of seeing her son, which oscillates between memory and observation.\\" Schutz has also commented \\"The painting is very different from the photograph. I could never render the photograph ethically or emotionally.\\" Co-curator of the Whitney Biennial containing the painting, Mia Locks, said in defense of the painting's inclusion, \\"Right now I think there are a lot of sensitivities not just to race but to questions of identities in general. We welcome these responses. We invited these conversations intentionally in the way that we thought about the show.\\" She added that the inclusion of the painting in the Whitney show was a way of \\"not letting Till's death be forgotten, as Mamie, his mother so wanted.\\" \\"The subject matter is not Schutz's,\\" Hannah Black wrote, in an open letter about the painting. \\"White free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights. The painting must go.\\" She added that \\"contemporary art is a fundamentally white supremacist institution despite all our nice friends.\\" In an interview in Artnet Schutz is asked \\"Could you have foreseen that you were stepping on a third rail by treating this explosive subject? If so, what made it necessary to paint Emmett Till specifically?\\" Schutz responded \\"Yes, for many reasons. The anger surrounding this painting is real and I understand that. It's a problematic painting and I knew that getting into it. I do think that it is better to try to engage something extremely uncomfortable, maybe impossible, and fail, than to not respond at all.\\" Lisa Whittington, a black woman who has also painted pictures on Emmett Till told NBC News \\"Art takes courage. It takes courage to create it, to show it, and to listen to people talk about your work. While I appreciate Dana Shutz's courage, and attempt to understand ‚Äî for me, her understanding is not deep enough and careless. The horror was too gentle in her work. She fell short and did not tell a complete story. She downplayed the details and the emotion his death represented.\\" Art historian George Baker wrote \\"We may want to believe that empathy has no restrictions but it does have limits. Schutz's painting, 'Open Casket,' is naive, like most of the artist's work. Not just in its painterly style but in its gesture, its 'logic.' But naivet√© edges into something much more sinister here, as the work collapses the destruction of Till's body and face, his murder, with the artist's own aesthetic. This is more narcissism than empathy. (Painting is not good at empathy; one of its founding myths, as Caravaggio long ago reminded us, of course is precisely the myth of Narcissus ‚Äì the myth of boundless self-love, the myth as well of what Lacan would have called 'mis-recognition.')\\" An open letter purportedly from artist Dana Schutz declaring her desire to remove the painting from exhibition was subsequently proven to be a hoax, and The New Yorker reported that \\"the museum has been fully supportive of the curators and the artist, and the painting will remain on view throughout the exhibit\\" and that \\"the calls to destroy the art were clearly rhetorical, and the protest inside the museum petered out a day or two after the show opened.\\" In April 2017, the Whitney Museum partnered with Claudia Rankine and the Racial Imaginary Institute to host \\"Perspectives on Race and Representation,\\" to address the debate sparked by the painting. In November 2017, the painting and the surrounding issues were discussed on BBC Radio 4's Analysis.

She is Professor of Mammalian Development and Stem Cell Biology in the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience and Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. She is also Bren Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering at Caltech. In 2020, she was listed by Prospect as the 10th-greatest thinker for the COVID-19 era, with the magazine writing, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been able to grow human embryos in vitro right up to the current 14-day legal limit.‚Äù  Education  Zernicka-Goetz was born in Warsaw, Poland. She received her Master of Science degree (summa cum laude) in developmental biology (1988) and her PhD degree in the developmental biology of mammals (1993) from the University of Warsaw with one year (1990‚Äì91) spent at the University of Oxford.  Career and research  After obtaining her Ph.D., Zernicka-Goetz spent two years as a post-doctoral European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) fellow with Professor Sir Martin Evans in the Wellcome Trust / Cancer Research UK Institute (now the Gurdon Institute) in Cambridge. In 1997, she started her independent group in the Gurdon Institute where she was a Lister Institute Senior Research Fellow (1997-2002) and subsequently a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow. In 2014, she moved her laboratory to the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience of the University of Cambridge. In 2007, she was awarded a readership and in 2010 a professorship at the University of Cambridge. Zernicka-Goetz was elected a member of EMBO in 2007, a fellow of the British Academy of Medical Sciences, 2013, and a foreign member of Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2016.  Scientific contributions  Zernicka-Goetz carried out her Ph.D. studies with Andrzej Tarkowski (Warsaw) and Chris Graham (Oxford) and her post-doctoral training with Sir Martin Evans (Cambridge). Upon setting up her independent group in 1997, she studied the mechanisms regulating early mammalian development. To do this, she was first to establish RNA interference in mammalian cells to determine cell fate in the mouse embryos. At that time, she also began to trace the origins and destinies of cells in the preimplantation mouse embryo that let her to discover that cell fate specification begins earlier than expected, an unexpected discovery but subsequently validated by her group and others. She found that this development of cell identity begins with heterogeneity in epigenetic regulation at the 4-cell stage that directs a molecular cascade establishing cell polarity, position and fate. Her recent development of systems permitting both mouse and human embryogenesis during implantation and early post-implantation stages in vitro allowed her to reveal that mouse and human embryo remodelling at implantation is done autonomously by the embryo. She uncovered the mechanism underlying embryo remodelling between the blastocyst and gastrula stages that has led to a change in the textbook model. Her demonstration of the self-organisation of human embryos developing in vitro until day 13/14, gastrulation, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study human development at previously inaccessible and critical stages. This discovery was hailed as the people's choice for the scientific breakthrough of 2016 by Science magazine. The knowledge she gained through her work on how the embryo develops during the blastocyst to gastrula transition, allowed her to mimic these developmental processes with different types of stem cells in vitro. This led her to the pioneering success of constructing embryo-like structures from pluripotent embryonic and multipotent extra-embryonic (trophoblast) stem cells in a 3D scaffold of extra-cellular matrix proteins in vitro. These \\"synthetic embryos\\" recapitulate the natural architecture of the embryo and their patterns of gene expression leading to the specification of the germ layers and germ cells. This system allowed her to identify signalling pathways responsible for morphogenesis of stem cells into embryos. Together these models bring outstanding potential for understanding development and for regenerative medicine. Zernicka-Goetz's group have shown that sperm entry induces actomyosin-driven cytoplasmic flows that are predictive of successful development to birth in the mouse. This provides an opportunity to identify quantitatively and non-invasively the healthiest embryos to transfer to would- be-mothers in IVF. Stimulated by the finding of placental cells with abnormal chromosome complements (aneuploid cells) in her own pregnancy, she began to study the consequence of aneuploidy upon development in a mouse model. Her lab generated an experimental model to find that aneuploid cells arising during embryogenesis in the mouse embryo become eliminated by apoptosis in embryonic but not extra-embryonic tissues. This gives insight into why mosaic aneuploidy identified by chorionic-villus-sampling can be tolerated in human pregnancies. The potential impact of Zernicka-Goetz's work is now becoming widely recognised through her public engagement. Her book ‚ÄúThe Dance of Life‚Äù co- authored with Roger Highfield, describes her scientific and personal journey devoted to understanding the earliest stages of our own life and the critical issue of women in science. \\"A touching, detailed portrait of a life in science. Beautifully written, it's a reminder that scientists are human and their humanity affects every part of their work.‚Äù -Angela Saini. \\"Few books succeed as well as this in taking a complex area of rapidly advancing science, and turning it into a compelling human story.

Gene duplication occurs in a large number of organisms as part of evolution or as the cause or result of disease (as in the case of the amylase genes in humans, and genes in cancer cells respectively). Gene duplication often leads to amplification of their gene products due to transcription and translation of all gene duplicates. Evidence of gene duplication has been observed the inheritance patterns of Paramecium tetraurelia, a common model organism. In one strain of P. tetraurelia, d4-95, a recessive mutant allele of a gene known as pawn-B found in this strain is inherited through gene duplication and amplification between generations, and even self- fertilizations. The inheritance of this allele is the first description of gene duplication and amplification in the micronucleus of ciliates. Additionally, it appears that the duplication of the mutant allele occurred after mutagenesis due to the similarity in nucleotide sequences of different copies of the mutant allele, especially in the coding region. When the d4-95 strain was crossed with a wild-type P. tetraurelia, F2 and later progeny often expressed the phenotype of the pawn-B mutant, despite carrying a wild-type gene at the pawn-B locus. This phenotype was maintained in progeny even after the self-fertilization of theoretical wild-type homozygotes that had been recovered from the cross. As is the case of other Paramecium, P. tetraurelia exhibits a number of non-Mendelian modes of inheritance, partially due to the existence of both macro- and micronuclei. In both the macro- and micronucleus of the d4-95 strain of P. tetraurelia contained many more copies of the mutant gene than in the wild type strain. This occurs due to the ability of most of the extra pawn-B gene copies to be heritable independently from the original pawn-B locus. Additionally, there is evidence that in the development of the macronucleus between generations, there is differential gene duplication of copies of pawn-B which causes variable amplification of the allele ‚Äì between four and twelve times ‚Äì and heterogeneity between the copies. This duplication leads to amplification of the gene that suppresses the expression of any non- mutant pawn-B loci. Duplication also occurs in the micronucleus, where considerably higher numbers of copies of the pawn-B mutant have been found than the number of copies of the wild-type non-mutant. Additionally, the number of copies can be decreased in progeny by ‚Äúdiluting‚Äù the copies of the mutant allele through backcrossing with the wild-type parent, over multiple generations. As the number of copies of the pawn-B mutant decrease, the progeny eventually return to Mendelian inheritance of the wild-type pawn-B alleles. While the exact structure of the amplified copies of the allele in the micronucleus is not currently known, it appears to be consistent with the original micronuclear locus, as opposed to the locus of the macronucleus, which includes regions not found in the micronuclear locus. Additionally, in some of the backcrosses, extra copies of the gene were still present, even after multiple generations. It is not clear whether this is due to tight linkage of the gene copies to the original locus, or because of continued gene duplication of the remaining copies, but it appears that it is more likely due to continued duplication, as the number of copies of the mutant pawn-B vary between the independent clones; it is also possible that there is an extrachromosomal element that plays a role, which has been observed in other protozoa.

The operation took place between 16 and 21 April as a continuation to Operation Nachshon and was commanded by Yitzhak Rabin. It brought three convoys of over 600 trucks. It also resulted in the formation of Palmach battalions into the Harel Brigade. The supplying of Jerusalem with food, medicine, arms, and fuel, enabled the city to withstand the siege, a siege which continued for the next two months, until the opening of the Burma Road in mid-June. According to combatant and, later, Brigade commander, Joseph Tabenkin, \\"[Operation] Harel extended the corridor to Jerusalem towards the south, in the mountainous area as far as Nahal Sorek.

After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Bucharest, she earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University before returning to Romania. Throughout her career, she researched and published over 150 scientific papers. She served as deputy director and full director of several research institutions in Romania and was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1963. Early life Alice Aronescu was born on 29 October 1905 in Olteni»õa, CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi County, into a Jewish family. She began her studies in biology at the University of Bucharest, graduating in 1929. That same year, she took a position at the Institute of Tobacco and Fermentation, working there for two years. In 1931, Aronescu went abroad to New York City to continue her education, under the direction of Bernard Ogilvie Dodge. In 1934, she received a PhD in microbiology and pathophysiology from Columbia University, with a thesis describing a fungus which attacked roses and returned to Romania. Career Aronescu began working as the head of the laboratory of the Agronomical Research Institute () in 1934, under the director of the section on Plant Pathology, Traian SƒÉvulescu. She was an asset to the department because she spoke English, but a liability because of her heritage. The two married in 1938 but shortly afterwards, in 1940, both were dismissed from their teaching posts because of Aronescu's Jewish heritage. Rehired in 1941, they continued their work. SƒÉvulescu's main focus of study was on diseases which effected cereals, fruit trees, and potatoes and analysis of parasite-host relationships, as well as the applicable use of fungicides. Some of her later works evaluated the use of radioactive isotopes in agriculture. When her husband left the ICAR in 1949, SƒÉvulescu replaced him as director. In 1952, SƒÉvulescu was made a corresponding member of the Romanian People's Republic Academy. Five years later, she became the deputy director of the Center for Biological Research () and in 1959 was appointed deputy director of the animal morphology laboratory. The following year, she was appointed the deputy director of the \\"Traian SƒÉvulescu\\" Institute of Biology. Made a full member of the Romanian People's Republic Academy in 1963, she was promoted to director of the Institute of Biology in 1964. Throughout her career, she authored or co-authored more than 150 scientific publications. Death and legacy In 1970, right after leaving a meeting with Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, the head of state, who informed her that the Institute was being transferred to the Department of Agriculture, SƒÉvulescu suffered a heart attack. She died on 1 February 1970 in Bucharest.

Wise was a 20th-Century attorney and member of the board of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). He served as attorney for William Perl, a friend of Julius Rosenberg and thus part of the Rosenberg Case on Soviet atomic espionage. Background Wise was born in 1895 or 1896 in New York City. In 1916, he obtained a bachelor's degree from (then) Columbia College (now Columbia University) in 1916. In 1919, he obtained a law degree from Columbia University Law School. Career He served as special assistant to the United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York from 1921 to 1922. He then served as deputy assistant New York State attorney general, 1928‚Äì1929. Wise served on the ACLU's board of directors from 1933 to 1951. During that time, he wrote in opposition of the Mundt-Nixon Bill of 1948 over the issue of \\"guilt by association\\" (see \\"Writings,\\" below). Wise was an attorney for William Perl in the Rosenberg Case (see next section below). Wise was a member of the committee on professional ethics of the Florida bar from 1964 to 1968 and chairman of the committee on professional ethics of the Dade County Bar Association from 1962 to 1966. Defense of William Perl (Rosenberg Case) Raymond L. Wise \\"of 80 Broad Street\\" was an attorney for William Perl, American physicist specializing in jet propulsion and supersonic flight ‚Äì and Soviet spy in the Rosenberg Case, as documents in the FBI's online \\"Vault\\" show. =Pretrial= By August 29, 1950, Wise was advising Perl to cooperate. Perl appeared before the Rosenberg Grand Jury in the summer of 1950, denying any relationship to the Rosenberg spy ring. On March 10, 1951, Wise and Perl met with FBI agents; Wise stated that Perl had paid him a \\"substantial fee\\" as retainer. On March 15, 1951, Perl was arrested. In April 1951, FBI advised Wise that they would make no deal with Perl over a plea of perjury. Wise argued that the Government lacked jurisdiction to indict, to no avail. The Government delayed the trial in September 1951 due to Wise's illness. In June 1952, Wise asked for a reduction in bail from twenty to five thousand dollars; the judge reserved the decision. In December 1952, Wise asked for another deferral, as he would be in Florida for the winter; the judge decided to keep to resumption in February 1953. In March 1953, Wise again asked for deferral until after Wise's return from Florida on April 21, 1953, stating that Perl would otherwise ask for adjournment. On March 26, 1953, the Government agreed to resume on May 4, 1953. After his return in late April 1953, Wise \\"stated in strict confidence that he felt Perl should pleasd guilty and cooperate with Government in giving espionage into.\\" By early May 1953, Wise reported that Perl remained unwilling to cooperate. On May 4, 1953, U.S. Judge Thomas Francis Murphy (government prosecutor in the Hiss Case) referred trial for instant case of perjury to Judge Sylvester J. Ryan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to commence on May 19, 1953, with Lloyd McMahon and Robert Martin prosecuting and Raymond L. Wise and Stanley Kanavek defending. =Trial= In court, the Government argued that Perl had knowingly lied that he knew Julius Rosenberg and Morton Sobell when they were all members of the Young Communists League or that he knew Helene Elitcher, Michael Sidorovich, or Anne Sidorvich. Wise argued that Perl did not lie intentionally. Perl could not explain how or whether Vivian Glassman had given him paper with Rosenberg's name on it because Perl had destroyed the paper. He could not explain why Sobell had used him as a job reference. Wise then argued that, earlier, Perl had appeared voluntarily when answering, not as a defendant and not under oath. On May 26, 1953, in his summation, Wise argued that Perl believed his answers true at the time he was answering. For instance, he answered truthfully that he did not \\"know\\" Sobell, as in \\"intimately,\\" not whether he ever knew him at all. As for evidence from Helene Ellitcher, Wise argued that the court could only expect her to corroborate the testimony of her husband, Max Elitcher, a communist and known perjurer. Perl had no motive to perjure himself; Wise asked for acquittal on all four perjury charges. On May 22, 1953, Perl was found guilty on two counts of perjury for lying about his \\"acquaintance and association\\" with Rosenberg and Sobell (and acquitted of two other counts). Perl served two concurrent five-year sentences at the New York House of Detention. Personal and death Wise married Nadine Trope; they had two sons. He was considered to be an \\"authority on legal ethics.\\" Later in life, he lived in North Miami. On July 6, 1986, Wise died of heart failure at the Miami Heart Institute, age 91. Writings In June 1948, he submitted a letter to the New York Times with a \\"careful study\\" of the provisions of the Mundt-Nixon Bill. Summarizing its spirit and intent, he wrote: > It is contrary to our fundamental theories of government to penalize or put > pressure on expression of opinion or on free association in advance of > personal criminal guilt, established after arial by due process of law.

She devoted herself to saving lives and health of people in Aomori Prefecture after the World War II, making efforts in building the educational institute for nurses, resolving towns and villages without health nurses from the standpoint of health administration, and establishing the system of rescue and nursing in remote areas. Her attitude has been handed down to a number of people who engage in nursing in Aomori even in Heisei period. Having worked as a military nurse during the war, she is known as a person who kept on telling her experiences during the war through self-published books because of an unwavering belief that \\"everything that stands against life is evil\\".  Biography  = Before and during WWII = After graduating from Aomori Hirosaki Girls' High School (later Aomori Prefectural Hirosaki Chuo High School), she had to give up the further study because of the financial difficulty of her family and decided to be independent as a nurse. After gaining her career in Japanese Red Cross Society (JRCS) and Morioka Nursing School, she started to work for Aomori Branch of JRCS in 1934. She was called up as a military nurse after the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, thus she spent almost all her youth in the battlefields. In 1942, she suffered from tuberculosis and typhoid fever on the hospital ships then went into the Hiroshima Military Hospital (later Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital). Although she had not chosen to be a nurse due to humanitarianism, she was impressed with devoted nursing by a nurse while hospitalized there, which greatly changed her thought of health nursing. She returned to the military after recovering from the typhoid fever. Gradually she agonized herself with the death of many soldiers and the reality that soldiers who recovered from wounds in the hospital go to their death again, she harbored her resentment against war itself finally concluding that \\"everything that stands against life is evil\\". At least by way of resisting the war, she continued to send the wills of soldiers dying in bed to their families without being noticed by the inspectors. The following year, 1943, she returned home because her tuberculosis was not cured. After studying hard, she got the certifications of a teacher of nursing and of a health nurse. She became the head nurse of the nursing school in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital which opened in the same year in Hachinohe and started to live in the residential hall together with her students. = Reform of nursing = In 1947, when the Association of Japanese Midwives, Nurses and Health Nurses (later Japanese Nursing Association) was established as one of the reforms of nursing by GHQ, she undertook the foundation of its branch in Aomori. Although she suffered from opposition by people who still had their old thoughts before WWII, Grace Elizabeth Alt (1905‚Äì1978), who was in Japan as a head nurse of the department of public health in GHQ, gave her a tremendous boost in it. Within the year, their hard work reached fruition and The Association of Japanese Midwives, Nurses, and Health Nurses in Aomori (later Aomori Prefectural Association of Nursing.) was established The following words from Alt to Hanada greatly encouraged her while struggling with the hardship because of postwar shortage in hospitals and in the education of nurses. In 1949, the outbreak of polio occurred in Hachinohe. The vaccine had not been developed in those days, and newspapers reported that phenomenon was a rare case in the world. Hanada, receiving the request from the doctor who was in charge of it, went to Tokyo for studying the treatment. She got the information materials of Kenny Method which was effective in Australia from GHQ with the help for JRCS. Curing people in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital every day, she introduced the method to the public through newspaper articles. In the reform of nursing at the postwar time, Hanada continued to studying American style nursing to find that education of nurses in Japan is far behind America. In order to have the society recognize nurses as a profession, she tried to establish an educational institute of nursing, following the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery in London. Her desire was achieved by opening the Aomori-ken Koto Kango Gakuin (later Aomori University of Health and Welfare). However, there was only one applicant at first, which proved that Hanada's thought had hardly been accepted to the public yet. A newspaper article titled \\"Hated Prefectural College of Nursing\\" denounced her building an unnecessary, nonurgent school. She visited high schools around Aomori in order to attract students by introducing Florence Nightingale with her handmade picture-story shows and to explain the importance of nursing education. Thanks to her efforts, the school had 38 applicants the following year. Hanada also worked there as a teacher.ÊùæÂ≤° 2010, p. 194. = Actions in the Prefectural Government = Accompanying the establishment of this prefectural institute, the Nursing Unite of Medical Department was founded in Aomori Prefectural Government. Hanada was asked to be the unit chief because she was the very person who proposed to establish the educational institute. In 1950, a year before the College of Nursing opened, she quit the Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital and started to work in the Government. This post was the top hierarchy in the educational system of nursing in Aomori. The fact that a woman from outside of the Prefectural Government got the position of a unit chief for the first time attracted tremendous interest amongst mass media at that time, not only because women in those days rarely had a position title but also because even male officers with more than 10 years' experiences had difficulty in getting the position like hers.ÊùæÂ≤° 2010, pp. 92‚Äì97 In 1955, Hanada visited Iwate Prefecture to study the health action by Iwate National Health Insurance Organization regarding Society-Managed Health Insurance had been active for a long time outstandingly in Tohoku Area. After returning, she cooperated with the same organization in Aomori to contribute to spreading their actions. While working on it, she discussed the health problems with the residents to realize the need to send health nurses around Aomori, following the examples like Kochi where the problems had successfully been resolved. In 1964, in order to resolve the infant mortality rate of Aomori that was the highest in Japan those days, Hanada started a campaign called \\"Mottara Korosuna Undo (the Never Kill If You Get Pregnant Campaign)\\" together with health nurses and midwives. She gave mothers bleached cotton to support their wombs if they notify their pregnancy to the Prefectural Government early for the purpose of raising awareness of not having fetuses die. This community-based campaign enabled health nurses to build relationships while visiting households steadily and honestly. In those days, approximately half of all the towns or villages in Aomori, especially remote areas, had no health nurse because of difficult financial situations of such communities and lack of health nurses who hoped to work there. In order to resolve this problem, Haken Hoken-fu Seido (The Temporary Health Nurse System) devised by Hanada began in 1965.Êú®Êùë 2012, pp. 234 This system allowed graduates from Prefectural College of Nursing to be employed as officials of Aomori Prefecture and sent to each town or village with traveling expenses paid by the government. This system increased the number of health nurses who accepted to work for remote areas as their period of toleration for some years before going back to cities. Moreover, some of them married and settled in their places of appointment to keep working there. Although 29 towns and villages had no health nurse in 1962, the establishment of the system of sending at least 2 of them in these areas in 1971 allowed all areas in Aomori Prefecture to have health nurses.ÈáëÂ≠ê 1992, pp. 273 It is said that the maintenance of this system of health nursing was impossible without the leadership of both Hanada and Takeuchi Shunkichi,Êú®Êùë 2012, pp. 256‚Äì265. who was the local governor in those days and had similar experiences to Hanada as a war correspondent. Hanada retired the Aomori Prefectural Government in 1973. Her position as the Health Nursing Supervisor at retirement was the highest of all female governors those days. She won the Public Health Award held by Dai-ichi Life Group in the same year, and To-o Award by To-o Daily Press in the following year. Alt URL = Actions as a Health Nursing Researcher = After retiring the local government, Hanada worked as a freelance researcher of health nursing. In 1950, she got the position of the head of Aogiri-kai in Japan Red Cross in Aomori (hereafter Aogiri-kai), a mutual support organization composed of unmarried women who studied nursing in JRCS, where she made her active base. She actively accepted many requests of lectures and interviews. In order to counter the threat from aging society, Hanada started Kango Ginko (Nursing Bank) organized by Aogiri- kai in 1980. The system was to have elderly people help work each other through the special tickets instead of money, where Hanada announced herself as the president. Although it was a pioneering system, it did not take its root in the society. In the following year, Aogiri-kai, the Association of Social Workers in Health Services of Aomori, and the Federation of Regional Women's Organization in Aomori cooperated starting telephone counseling services for senior citizens called \\"Koreisha 110 ban (number 110 for senior citizens)\\". This system developed later, resulting in organizing \\"Volunteer Ajisai\\", where the three organizations and the branch office of Japanese Nursing Association collaborate with each other. Hanada also worked as its caretaker. In 1994, Hanada was nominated for Florence Nightingale Medal. Even though this is the most prestigious award in the world as a nurse, she rejected to receive it. She told the reason in the bulletin of Aogiri-kai titled Aogiri-kai Dayori as a previous military nurse and a person who experienced the WWII as below;Within the same year, she self-published the collection of her war stories as a military nurse, Kataritsugitai (I Want To Hand This Down). Also in 1997, she published the Tanka collection titled Oki Nao Kiezu (Fire Has Not Yet Disappeared), hoping to tell many people her experiences of the war. It was hard to transmit experiences of the war as memories of it was gradually fading after half a century of the postwar period. Despite that, she continued to self-publishing her war stories and sent them to her friends. = Late life = In 1998, Hanada resigned the head of Aogiri-kai on account of old age. She stayed away from people who were in close relationships before, only keeping in touch with them by exchanging letters. It is said this was because she did not like to show old and weak herself to people.ÊùæÂ≤° 2010, pp. 186‚Äì192. In 2006, Hanada died for the liver cancer at the age of 91. She was unmarried throughout her life because she lost the chance because of the war. Based on her will, her body was given to the Faculty of Medicine in Hirosaki University and the funeral was not held. Her last words as a pacifist, which was sent to her younger brother, was published in her obituary in To-o Daily Press and impressed the readers.ÊùæÂ≤° 2010, pp.204‚Äì213.  Evaluation  Hanada and Satoe Kamimura, who led health nursing in Kochi Prefecture in Showa era, were called \\"Miki Hanada in Aomori for the East, Satoe Kamimura in Kochi for the West\\". They were also called \\"Emperor Kamimura for the West, Emperor Hanada for the East\\" by people who engaged in nursing in those days because of their leadership and humanity. Compared with Kamimura, Hanada is remarkable in that she seriously regarded the action by local residents and labor movement by health nurses. This is because of their different career experiences; when Kamimura started to work as a health nurse, the purpose of the work had already been unified for cooperation in the all-out war, while Hanada had been an expert in nursing activities before the unique health nursing system in Aomori Prefecture started.Êú®Êùë 2012, pp.266‚Äì268 On the other hand, since she regarded the residents and labors seriously, she often clashed not only with the administration when working for the hospital but also with the top management and the government when working for Aomori Prefectural Government. When she tried to improve the working condition of nurses in the hospital, the doctors taunted her to be so Americanized.ÊùæÂ≤° 2010, pp. 70‚Äì89. When the innovative councilors criticized the way of governing health nursing in Aomori prefectural assembly, the false rumor that Hanada stirred them to do it flew. Hanada herself was severely told off by her boss even though she knew nothing. She also clashed with her boss when tackling on the health nursing in remote areas, which made her write resignation letters several times. It is said that she endured these hardships remembering the encouragement across the border by Grace Elizabeth Alt in GHQ. The previous nurses in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital describe Hanada as a person who always thought of nurses as their head in the prewar era when the social position of women was low and working women were received prejudice; One of Hanada's students in Aomori-ken Koto Kango Gakuin, who later worked as a professor in Aomori University of Health and Welfare, Faculty of Health Science, Department of Nursing, told the feature of her lectures like below;The Chief of public health department of Aomori Prefectural Government in those days called her \\"giant\\", evaluating her activities there like below;\\"Mottara Korosuna Undo\\" promoted by her in Aomori Prefectural Government was worth Nobel Prize in that the campaign remarkably contributed to the reduction of infant death rates by improving the local nursing services.ÈáëÂ≠ê 1992, p. 274. However, there were contrary opinions that the word \\"Korosuna (Never kill)\\" was too direct and shocking for a slogan. Additionally, some criticized distributing bleached cotton as bribing women with stuff they want, others insisted that Aomori Prefecture was regarded as the representative of backward prefecture because the bleached cotton was thought to be out of date. The system to send health nurses formulated by Hanada in the following year called \\"Aomori Method\\" was paid a special attention to and highly evaluated all over Japan. After this system was established, no town or village suffered from the tough situation without health medical services. Despite that, the system was hard to be accepted by the personnel department and the general affairs department in the prefectural government because it had to employ health nurses, who each town and village normally should have employed by themselves. The \\"Nurse Bank\\", which she formulated as the resolution of aging society after retiring the prefectural government, was paid much attention to by mass media since the system was pioneering. However, the reason for its unsuccess is indicated as following; that it was not the right time; that the leader had already retired the official; and that she lacked people who could always assist her. Despite that, both the Association of Social Workers in Health Services of Aomori and the Federation of Regional Women's Organization in Aomori were interested in the \\"Nurse Bank\\" as a supportive system for aged people, joining \\"Koreisha 110 ban\\" which had the same purpose. \\"Koreisha 110 ban\\" was reputed to make multiplier effects on account of cooperation of three different types of associations and organizations. Some customers those says made full use of the counseling service, talking for 40 minutes. It was rare in those days for several different parties to cooperate with each other but Hanada bridged them with her caring personality, according to the vice president of the Association of Social workers in Health Services of Aomori at the time. The Social Welfare Council in Aomori has the similar service \\"Fukushi Anshin Denwa (Welfare and Security Hot Line)\\", whose predecessor is \\"Koreisha 110 ban\\" run by Hanada.

She married a German professor in 1938 and wrote about her experiences in M√ºnster during the Second World War and the aftermath. Early life and education Born Elisabeth Sims in Toronto, daughter of an evangelical Canadian pastor. She studied English and history at the University of Toronto, earning her B.A. in 1931 and her M.A. in 1934. She studied abroad in Paris, Tours, Frankfurt am Main and Berlin through a Gertrud Davis Scholarship for study in Germany.Gertrud Davis Scholarships for study in Germany During a study tour in Berlin in 1934/1935, she met her future husband, . Academic career From 1935 to 1938 she was a lecturer in the Department of Historical Geography at the University of Toronto. On 3 September 1938, she married Albert Hoemberg in Toronto. German nationals were unwelcome in Canada at the outbreak of the Second World War after Hitler's annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland, so the couple moved to Germany in December 1938. Albert, an anti-Nazi professor, was drafted into the Luftwaffe in 1940, served as a map clerk in Paris and Germany, and became a prisoner of war of the Allies in 1945. Although under suspicion, the couple wrote their diaries and corresponded frankly about the progress of the war. These documents were hidden from the Nazis under the doghouse in the garden of their home in the Roxel village of M√ºnster. The bulk of these sources survived and were eventually published. Hoemberg's academic career was interrupted by the birth of her three children (1939, 1941 and 1944). From April 1945 to April 1946, she was the chief interpreter of the British military government of the allied occupation in M√ºnster. From 1946 to 1973 she was a lecturer at the English seminary at the University of M√ºnster. Some years after her husband's early death in 1963, she returned to Canada, where she settled on Halfmoon Bay, British Columbia. She lived her last years on Vancouver Island and died in 1994. Significant work Hoemberg's most notable contribution was the publication in 1950 of a book of diaries and letters, \\"Thy People, My People\\", about her wartime experiences in Germany. The book was reviewed in England and the U.S., being published in both countries. The diaries and correspondence with her husband were practically the only firsthand records of the wartime experience and grass-roots resistance in Germany to be published in English, and the only one by a Canadian national. The diaries also covered the traumatic first year of postwar occupation and resettlement. In 1956, Dieter Pferdekamp, a student at the Roxel Volksschule, became aware of this book from London telling of the war in Roxel, and later used passages as a source for the teaching of students. Hoemberg had worked on a German translation but encountered considerable resistance from the University administration. The death of her husband and her poor health resulting from wartime hardships and injuries left her without the strength and resources to complete the translation. The book finally was translated by Renate Resing and appeared with notes by Mr. Pferdekamp in 2017, as \\"Dein Volk ist Mein Volk\\", published by Aschendorff Verlag. In her memoirs, Hoemberg portrays dramatic situations such as the crash of a badly injured English pilot and his rescue from a summary execution. In M√ºnster she was constantly under attack by allied bombers throughout the war as well as being under suspicion as an Englishwoman, and endured the ever-present food shortages. Hoemberg, together with a neighbor \\"Frau Ritter,\\" organized \\"a small Roxel resistance\\". She popularized three sermons of Clemens August Graf von Galen against the confiscation of Church goods, the extermination of clericals, and the euthanasia practices of the National Socialists, \\"words flung from the pulpit of Saint Lamberti which I had stayed up all one night to copy from a furtively borrowed MSS\\". These were airdropped by the Allies, and distributed in July and August 1941 in Roxel's St. Pantaleon church as well as in M√ºnster's St. Lamberti and √úberkirchenkirche. A highlight of her work after the war was serving as Cardinal von Galen's interpreter in meetings with the Military Government, and being told by him \\"Do not hesitate to translate my words literally, it is I who accept the responsibility for them, not you.\\" The memoirs end with Albert's release from imprisonment and return to their home in Roxel, which had survived the intensive bombing of M√ºnster itself. She translated into English his diaries written on toilet paper during a year in prisoner of war camps, most of which have yet to be published.

Route description Jefferson City Bridge The highway passes south-to-north through Missouri, from Arkansas to Iowa, serving cities such as Rolla, Jefferson City, Columbia, Moberly, Macon, and Kirksville. Notable routes that are intersected include U.S. Route 60 in Howell County, Interstate 44 at Rolla, U.S. Route 50 (which it shares a concurrency with into Jefferson City south of the Missouri River until it reaches the junction with U.S. 54), U.S. Route 54 (which it overlaps in Jefferson City from the junction with U.S. Route 50 and crosses the Missouri River with on the Jefferson City Bridge), Interstate 70 at Columbia, U.S. Route 24 at Moberly, U.S. Route 36 at Macon, and U.S. Route 136 at Lancaster. Stonehenge next to U.S. Route 63 The road enters the state (passing the Oregon County line) at Thayer. Immediately after leaving Thayer, U.S. 63 intersects Route 19, then continues into Howell County on a two-lane highway with alternating passing lanes, en route to West Plains. The highway then widens to a four-lane divided highway, bypassing West Plains to the south and west, then continues on a divided highway to Willow Springs. The route then joins US Route 60, and the two highways run concurrently northwest to Cabool. North of Cabool, the highway returns to two- lane status (with alternating passing lanes), passing through Houston and intersecting Route 32 in Licking. The highway then enters Phelps County and passes through Rolla, the home of Missouri University of Science and Technology, and becomes locally known as Bishop Avenue. In Rolla, Route 63 intersects Route 72, and later, Business Loop 44. The Business Loop runs concurrently with Route 63 past the University's campus to Interstate 44, where the Business Loop ends. As it leaves Rolla, the highway quickly narrows to two lanes, crossing into Maries County toward Vienna, intersecting Highway 42. After entering Osage County, Route 63 passes through Freeburg and Westphalia. A few miles north of Westphalia, Highway 63 widens to a four-lane divided highway, and almost immediately intersects US Route 50, and the two highways head west toward Jefferson City, the state capital. After passing through downtown on the Whitton Expressway, the route leaves Route 50, joining the eastbound direction of US Route 54 to cross the Missouri River into Callaway County. After crossing the river, Route 63 exits Route 54, and heads north on a four-lane divided highway. About five miles north of US 54, the highway enters Boone County, then after five miles more, leaves the Ozark Plateau, entering the Columbia area. Highway 63 passes along the eastern edge of Columbia, but gains freeway status for about 10 miles through town. In the north part of town, Route 63 intersects Interstate 70. There is no direct connection between Route 63 and I-70; access to and from the Interstate is via an at-grade connector road, which intersects I-70 at a simple Diamond interchange. The route then leaves Columbia, returning to expressway status, and intersects Route 22 near Clark, right on the Boone-Randolph county line. After passing by Clark proper, U.S. 63 gains a Business Route, which passes through the otherwise-bypassed town of Renick, then passes through the city of Moberly. Mainline Route 63, meanwhile, upgrades to a freeway for about four miles as it passes through Moberly, intersecting US Route 24 at an interchange on the northern end of town. Heading north, U.S. 63 enters Macon County just north of Jacksonville, and heads toward the city of Macon. Through town, the highway narrows to a two-lane city street, with a center left-turn lane. Near the northern edge of town, US 63 intersects US Route 36, which is part of the Chicago-Kansas City Expressway. Leaving Macon, the highway re-gains expressway status, and passes by La Plata before crossing into Adair County. South of Kirksville, the route interchanges with a Business Route, which passes through the √∑city proper, while mainline Route 63 narrows to two lanes and enters a newly-constructed bypass to the east of town. While on the bypass, the highway intersects Route 6 and Missouri Route 11, and the two east-west state routes form a three-mile long Wrong-way concurrency with each other following US 63. Leaving the Kirksville bypass, US 63 returns to a two-lane surface highway, and enters Schuyler County. Near Lancaster, the highway intersects US Route 136, which briefly overlaps with Route 63 into Lancaster itself. There, Route 136 turns east, while Route 63 continues north into Iowa, exiting Missouri about five miles north of Lancaster. History U.S. 63 in Missouri was Route 7 from 1922 to 1926.

He was the elder brother of Eumelos and Prytanis. He and his brothers engaged in the Bosporan Civil War, a dynastic dispute that occurred when Eumelos made a rival claim to the throne. Reign and Civil War When his father Paerisades died in 310 BC, Satyros inherited the throne and government as he was the eldest son. Shortly after, his brother Eumelos fled to the lands of the Siraces, where he entered into an alliance with Aripharnes, king of the Siraces, and made a rival claim to the throne. As soon as Satyros learned of this, he set out against his brother Eumelos with his army thus starting the Spartocid civil war. Satyros's own army had a total of 34,000 troops, a mixture of Greeks, Thracians, and Scythians. After cornering his younger brother, they fought at the Battle of the River Thatis, which resulted in a strategic victory for Satyrus and demonstrated his suitability for the throne of his father. Final Battle and Death Satyros pursued his brother and his ally, Ariphanes, who both retreated to the capital of the Siraces. Upon approaching the city, he realised that it would be hard to take as the city was built on the river Thatis and surrounded by thick marshes. There were also man made defences including a fortified gate and a well-protected castle at the other entrance. Knowing he wouldn't be able to take the city, he at first plundered the countryside, gaining many prisoners and plunder. The Siege of Siracena ensued. However Satyros died fighting Aripharnes while attempting to protect his mercenary captain, Meniscus. His brother Prytanis became king shortly after his death, and fought Eumelos but shared the same fate. His brother Eumelos killed off the families of his brothers, but Satyros's son, Paerisades, survived and fled to Scythia, where he was given asylum by its king, Agarus.

Aleksandr Mikhailovich Pykhtin took command of the division on the day it began forming, a position he would hold until December 15. On October 12, while still barely formed, the division was sent to the front in the Taganrog Group, and about a week later was assigned to the 9th Army in Southern Front. Not surprisingly, the division saw its first action in the Battle of Rostov, first in the Donbass-Rostov Strategic Defensive Operation and later, after being transferred to the 37th Army, in the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation. During the latter the 339th played a role in the counterattack, beginning on November 27, that deeply outflanked 1st Panzer Army's positions in Rostov, eventually forcing it back to the Mius River line and, incidentally, costing Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt his job as commander of Army Group South.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 83 On December 16, Colonel Pykhtin was succeeded in command by Col. Pavel Ivanovich Morozov. In January, 1942, the division was transferred to 56th Army, still in Southern Front. It remained in this Army and Front, facing the Axis forces along the Mius until the beginning of July, when their summer offensive began on this sector of the front. 56th Army was on the southernmost sector, down to the coast of the Sea of Azov, and the 339th was deployed in first echelon with the 30th and 31st Rifle Divisions. 1st Panzer and 17th Armies began their attack on July 7 and by the 16th the Front commander, Lt. Gen. Rodion Malinovsky, was authorized by the STAVKA to order his armies to begin an orderly withdrawal to the Don River south of Rostov over five nights, protected by strong rearguards. Late on the 20th, LVII Panzer Corps had crossed the Mius and was driving the rearguards of 56th Army back towards the city. In the following days the 339th, along with its companion divisions and 16th Rifle Brigade, was ordered to defend its namesake city by the Army commander, Maj. Gen. Viktor Tsyganov, by manning the outer and inner defensive belts on the northern and eastern sectors. These plans were undone by the rapid advance of the German tank forces and the premature withdrawal of 18th Army south of the Don. 56th Army was forced to withdraw as well, and after a bitter defense mainly by NKVD security troops Rostov-on-Don fell to the Germans for the second time on July 27.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 112, 177, 202‚Äì03 Caucasus and Crimean Campaigns After the fall of Rostov the division retreated into the Caucasus, in the Coastal Operational Group of North Caucasus Front as of August 1. At this time 56th Army had only three rifle divisions, a rifle brigade, and two fortified regions. The first task of the Operational Group was to defend the city of Krasnodar from the advancing forces of German 17th Army. Its V Army Corps broke into the city on August 10, but a spirited defense of the suburb of Pashkovskaya by 30th Rifle allowed most of the defenders to evacuate south of the Kuban River before the bridge was blown up in the Germans' faces, further delaying their advance.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 414, 424, 578 In the midst of this, on August 14, the 339th came under the command of Col. Teodor Sergeevich Kulakov. As of September 4 the division was in Front reserves of Transcaucasus Front, having been transferred from North Caucasus Front when the latter was dissolved. When the German 17th Army began a new offensive towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse on September 23 it was back in 56th Army, now under command of Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Ryzhov, which was deployed in the center of the Black Sea Group of Forces, from Cherkasovskii to Staroobriadcheskii, opposing the 125th Infantry Division, plus elements of Romanian 19th Infantry and 6th Cavalry Divisions. Tuapse was successfully defended, and the 339th was still in 56th Army when the German offensive ground to a halt in early November.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 563, 602, 604, 606 At the end of the year the division was moved to 47th Army, still in the Black Sea Group, and moved north with this Army in April, 1943, into the Steppe \\"Military District\\" in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding. Leaving the reserves in July, it returned to 56th Army in the revived North Caucasus Front and fought on the Taman Peninsula from August to November under the 16th Rifle Corps. The division's service there was recognized with the honorific \\"Taman\\", and it would remain in 16th Corps for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 83 Almost immediately following the victory at Taman, 18th and 56 Armies launched the Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation, a set of amphibious assaults from Taman across the Kerch Strait into the Crimea. Over the course of November 6, 7 and 8 all three of the 339th's rifle regiments crossed the icy waters, and on the 9th attacked in the direction of Kolonka and Kerch. After two days of sustained heavy combat the division managed to penetrate the German defenses to reach a line from \\"unnamed height 1 kilometre south of Height Marker 82.5, Height Marker 5.0, the eastern edge of Kankany and Kolonka, the Voikov metallurgical factory, and the eastern edge of Kerch\\". At 0100 hours on November 15 the division resumed its assault, with the 227th Rifle Division on its right flank, but again failed to achieve success, losing six men killed and 20 wounded in the process; the division's combat journal described the German defense as \\"persistent resistance by fire\\". At 1325 hours on November 16 the German air force began a series of heavy strikes against the division's positions, with over 100 Ju 87 and Bf 109 sorties. Colonel Kulakov had established his observation post in the midst of his division's forward defense line in the northern portion of the Voikov factory. At 1330 hours he was killed along with two other officers standing nearby by a bomb blast, with a fourth officer wounded. Unaware of his fate, the People's Commissariat of Defense issued a decree the following day promoting Kulakov to the rank of Major General. On May 16, 1944, Kulakov was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his outstanding performance in the Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation, along with a captain and a sergeant-major of his division who were also killed during its course. Kulakov was buried at Krasnodar.Aleksandr A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. and trans. by D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, pp. 229‚Äì30 Kulakov was replaced in command of the 339th by Col. Grigorii Mironovich Pustovit. On November 15 a new Separate Coastal Army was formed from the command elements of North Caucasus Front, and 16th Rifle Corps was assigned to it. The fighting for Kerch would go on into January, 1943. German 17th Army in Crimea had by now been isolated by land, and its fall was a matter of time. Meanwhile it maintained a persistent defense. On the night of January 22‚Äì23, Army commander Col. Gen. Ivan Petrov ordered a coup de main against Kerch, with the Azov Flotilla transporting two naval infantry battalions into the harbor. Although these troops briefly seized part of the port, they were too far apart for mutual support and were gradually destroyed piecemeal. Meanwhile, the 339th made every effort to break through and relieve the naval infantrymen, but was repulsed. Petrov was relieved of command of the Army in February.Robert Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2014, pp. 261‚Äì62 On March 2, Col. Gavril Tarasovich Vasilenko became commanding officer of the division, a post he would hold for the duration. He was promoted to Major General on April 27, 1945. During April and May the 339th distinguished itself in the liberation of Crimea and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on April 24 for its role in the liberation of Feodosia.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 83 Into Germany Following the Crimean campaign the 339th remained in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, still in Separate Coastal Army, until September, when it was assigned to the 33rd Army, which joined the 1st Belorussian Front in October. The division would remain under these commands for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 83 At the start of the Vistula-Oder Offensive 33rd Army was in the Pu≈Çawy bridgehead over the Vistula, and attacked from there on January 12, 1945, when the offensive opened. The advance brought the forces of 33rd Army to the Oder River near the confluence with the Bober by February 15.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. by R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 51‚Äì52, 415, 576‚Äì77, 591 At the outset of the Battle of Berlin 33rd Army was part of its Front's left shock group, and the division was part of 16th Rifle Corps with the 323rd and 383rd Rifle Divisions. The Corps was one of three in the Army's first echelon, and the 339th was in the first echelon of its Corps. On April 16, the first day of the offensive, 16th Corps advanced over wooded and swampy terrain to a depth of 4 ‚Äì 6 km and by the end of the day had reached the line of the railway bridge 2 km southeast of Frankfurt-on-Oder. On April 18 the advance was limited to one kilometre, due to the commitment of German reserves, and reached the line of Frankfurter- Hoe ‚Äì Markendorf. The picture changed by the 21st, as 16th Corps continued attacking to the northwest and completed the breakthrough of the main German defensive zone, reaching as far as the Oder‚ÄìSpree Canal.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation, 1945, ed. and trans. by R.W.

The first four parameters, RQD (rock quality designation), Jn (joint set number), Jr (joint roughness number) and Ja (joint alteration number) are the same as in the Q-system. However, the frictional resistance pair Jr and Ja can apply, when needed, to individual sides of a potentially unstable wedges. Simply applied orientation factors (0), like (Jr/Ja)1x0.7 for set J1 and (Jr/Ja)2x0.9 for set J2, provide estimates of overall whole-wedge frictional resistance reduction, if appropriate. The Q-system term Jw is replaced with Jwice, and takes into account a wider range of environmental conditions appropriate to rock slopes, which are exposed to the environment indefinitely. The conditions include the extremes of erosive intense rainfall, ice wedging, as may seasonally occur at opposite ends of the rock-type and regional spectrum. There are also slope-relevant SRF (strength reduction factor) categories. Multiplication of these terms results in the Q-slope value, which can range between 0.001 (exceptionally poor) to 1000 (exceptionally good) for different rock masses. A simple formula for the steepest slope angle (Œ≤), in degrees, not requiring reinforcement or support is given by: \\\\beta = 20\\\\log_{10}Q_{slope}+65^\\\\circ Q-slope is intended for use in reinforcement- free site access road cuts, roads or railway cuttings, or individual benches in open cast mines.

Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court Case from 1979. Its plaintiff was a hearing-impaired student who, after being denied access to the school's nursing department, filed a lawsuit against claiming injustice to the Fourteenth amendment and to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Background  Frances Davis was a student at Southeastern Community College and applied for the nursing program. Davis also had a hearing impairment, thus, her hearing was very poor and she relied mostly on lip-reading, even with a hearing aid. When she was interviewed, the problem was quickly noticed and she was told to consult an audiologist. Davis was diagnosed with a ‚Äúbilateral, sensori-neural hearing loss,‚Äù and even with an improvement with a hearing aid she would only be able to dictate speech when someone spoke directly to her. The Executive Director of the State Board of Nursing reviewed her application and decided that it would not be safe for her to be a student in the program or to be a nurse. It was also decided that the accommodations that would have to be made for Davis would stop her from fully benefiting from the program. Davis asked the board to review the application once again, but was denied. After the second attempt, Davis filed a lawsuit claiming the school was denying her of the Fourteenth amendment and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Decision  The District Court decided that because Davis was not able to work adequately as a nurse, then she was not protected under Section 504, which states that a person must be able to perform all duties of a job, despite their disability. According to The Law and Higher Education, the court stated that ‚ÄúIn many situations such as an operation room intensive care unit, or post-natal care unit, all doctors and nurses wear surgical masks which would make lip-reading impossible. Additionally, in many situations, a Registered Nurse would be required to instantly follow a physician‚Äôs instructions concerning procurement of various types of instruments and drugs where the physician would be unable to get the nurse‚Äôs attention by other than vocal means.‚Äù The decision was overturned by the Fourth Court, saying that the first court did not understand Section 504. After reviewing the case the Supreme Court decided that the ability to hear was crucial in a nurse's daily work, and the accommodations that the program would have to provide was far more than what Section 504 outlines.  After the case  Southeastern Community College vs Davis was a landmark case because it helped define the outlines of Section 504 regarding reasonable accommodations and what accommodations would drastically impact a program. It was the first case that brought attention to Section 504 and now any program does not have to make changes that would affect the core of the program or that would have an unnecessary financial burden.

He has received 12 Chicago Music Awards (CMA), for \\"Best Calypso,\\" \\"Best Soul Calypso,\\" and \\"Best Gospel/Spiritual Band,\\" as well as CMA's \\"Lifetime Achievement Award,\\" for his contributions to the Chicago music industry and community involvement. Early life and education Champion was born in Pittsburgh, PA, but moved to Chicago at an early age, where he was enrolled in public K-12 schools, and the Chicago Art Institute Junior School. He attended Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville (SIUE), and Columbia College Chicago where, in 1974, he received his Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design. Career Before graduating from Chicago's Columbia College, Champion went to work at a couple of Michigan Ave ad agencies in the day and playing music at night. He was approached by a songwriter from the island of St Kitts to record at Bob Marley's Tuff Gong Studio in Kingston, Jamaica. With Gypsi in 1982, he recorded his first release titled \\"The Girls\\" for Obvio Records at Paul Serrano Studios in Chicago. Gypsi-Fari also won the first awards from the Chicago Music Awards in 1982. After leaving Gypsi in 1982, Champion returned to the private sector and was recruited for a band to back Jamaican singer/songwriter Carlean Davis for her North American tour. Her EP release featured two songs written by Champion, and was reviewed in the \\"College Musical Journal\\" (CMJ). Soon after college stations nationwide were requesting promo copies for programming. Champion chose to form his own group and established Roots Rock Society (RRS). With RRS, members could come and go, but the project would remain intact. With RRS, Champion created his \\"Tropical Roots\\" sound with the release of \\"Again\\", a four-song EP co-produced by David Axelbaum who worked with (Bob Seeger, Peter Frampton, Johnny Winters and Koko Taylor) that reached over 250 radio stations worldwide.

The Modesto Manifesto, was a set of standards for religious leaders that became notable as the signature practice among men in which they avoid spending time alone with people of the opposite sex to whom they are not married. It has additionally taken a more modern meaning as a display of integrity, a means of avoiding sexual temptation, to avoid any appearance of doing something considered morally objectionable, and to avoid being accused of sexual harassment or assault. Created for male evangelical Protestant leaders by Billy Graham, it has been popularly known as the \\"Billy Graham rule.\\" Its adoption by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has had it additionally nicknamed the \\"Mike Pence rule\\". The Modesto Manifesto has found a prominent foothold on Wall Street and more generally in American finance for its ability to limit the \\"risk\\" of perceived sexual impropriety.  Background  = \\"Billy Graham rule\\" = In 1948, Graham held a series of evangelistic meetings in Modesto, California. Together with Cliff Barrows, Grady Wilson and George Beverly Shea, he resolved to \\"avoid any situation that would have even the appearance of compromise or suspicion\\". The accountability agreement, which has become known as the \\"Modesto Manifesto\\", covered not only their interactions with women, but also commitments to integrity with respect to: * finances, * their interactions with local churches, and * publicity. From that time onward, Graham made a point of not traveling, meeting, or eating alone with a woman other than his wife Ruth. Graham biographer Grant Wacker observed that \\"Over the years Graham received intense media scrutiny, but hardly anyone accused him of violating any of those four principles.\\" By Graham's own admission, though, he was not an absolutist in the application of the rule that now bears his name: his autobiography relates a lunch meeting with Hillary Clinton that he initially refused on the grounds that he does not eat alone with women other than his wife, but she persuaded him that they could have a private conversation in a public dining room. = \\"Mike Pence rule\\" = Vice President Mike Pence with his wife, Karen, in 2017. In March 2017, The Washington Post noted that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence never eats alone with a woman other than his wife, Karen, and that he won't attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side. Emma Green, writing for The Atlantic, noted that the controversy was an example of how \\"notions of gender divide American culture\\": while \\"socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence's practice as misogynistic or bizarre\\", for \\"a lot of conservative religious people\\" the \\"set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise\\". Polish science fiction writer Jacek Dukaj called this rule an inevitable and likely to grow in popularity as an outcome of the Me Too movement and cancel culture.  Prevalence on Wall Street  The rule has become increasingly popular on Wall Street, and more generally, in American finance, in the wake of the late-2010s #MeToo movement. Many male (and more rarely female) bankers, financial advisors, and financial service professionals have adhered to the rule in order to avoid the appearance of sexual impropriety. According to a 2019 LinkedIn report, 30 per cent of corporate superiors (of both male and female genders) felt uncomfortable mentoring female colleagues. Female workers are considered by some to be \\"an unknown risk\\" to banks, akin to market, liquidity, contract, and user risks. According to a December 2018 Bloomberg study, financial professionals often refuse to eat dinners alone with female colleagues and clients, sit apart from them on flights, book rooms on different hotel floors, and avoid meeting them one-on-one, particularly in private rooms. Private meetings with senior members are typically conducted \\"with the door left wide open\\". This rule has been identified as a factor in the lower levels of women in finance. The Economist criticized and praised the rule's spread across Wall Street in 2018. It has allowed the workplace to become \\"all the most transparent\\" the paper said, adding that it was \\"[men], rather than the women, who were creating all the risk.\\" Worries about exaggerated, mischaracterized, incorrect, inaccurate, or misleading recollections of interactions with females are said to fuel some of the rule's popularity on Wall Street. In response to the #MeToo movement, Wall Street developed a \\"culture of walking on eggshells\\" around women on Wall Street due to its belief in the highly subjective nature of sexual harassment and assault. The practice has been critiqued by corporate and human resources lawyers for potentially being gender discrimination. However, it is difficult to prove that the rule is actually being applied as most of financial services is project -, client-, and account-based. The Guardian reported that in August 2019, \\"27 per cent of men avoided one-on-one meetings with female co-workers, 21 per cent of men said they would be reluctant to hire women for a job that would require close interaction, and 19 per cent of men would be reluctant to hire an attractive woman.\\" The same study also found that women were more reluctant to hire attractive women in jobs that required close interaction. MarketWatch reported in June 2019 that nearly 60 per cent of men were uncomfortable being alone with their female colleagues.  Reactions  The rule has been criticized for viewing women as potential objects of lust, as well as restricting opportunities for women to network with any male colleagues who happen to implement this rule. When applied to workplace dinners or meetings in the United States, it could result in illegal labor discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. American pastor Tracey Bianchi says that one result is that \\"women are marginalized and cut out of opportunities to network, share their ideas, and advance in the organization.\\" Bianchi also says that the rule conflicts with the practice of Jesus himself, who spent time alone with the Samaritan woman at the well. American pastor Ty Grigg says that the rule (assuming all American pastors implemented it) has not been \\"effective at curbing infidelity\\". He says that the rule \\"has framed relating with the opposite sex with fear\\", and that this leads to a diminished mutual respect, which in turn creates \\"the kind of environment where inappropriate relating is more likely to occur\\". Others, though, suggest that unfaithful pastors must have failed to implement the rule. Messianic Jewish author Michael L. Brown says that critics of the rule have misunderstood the purposes of the rule. He says that the rule prevents third parties from suspecting that an illicit romantic relationship exists (avoiding the appearance of evil). It also protects against any future accusations should the other party become embittered and seek to attack the innocent boss. Finally, it does protect both parties from developing natural attractions and potentially falling into adultery.  U.S. public opinion  According to a 2017 poll conducted by the Morning Consult for the New York Times, 53 per cent of women and 45 per cent of men believe that it would be inappropriate to have dinner alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not their spouse, compared to 35 per cent of women and 43 per cent of men who would consider it appropriate.

This is a specific form of screen scraping or web scraping dedicated to search engines only. Most commonly larger search engine optimization (SEO) providers depend on regularly scraping keywords from search engines, especially Google, to monitor the competitive position of their customers' websites for relevant keywords or their indexing status. Search engines like Google do not allow any sort of automated access to their service but from a legal point of view there is no known case or broken law. The process of entering a website and extracting data in an automated fashion is also often called \\"crawling\\". Search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo get almost all their data from automated crawling bots.  Difficulties  Google is the by far largest search engine with most users in numbers as well as most revenue in creative advertisements, this makes Google the most important search engine to scrape for SEO related companies. Google does not take legal action against scraping, likely for self-protective reasons. However, Google is using a range of defensive methods that makes scraping their results a challenging task. * Google is testing the User-Agent (Browser type) of HTTP requests and serves a different page depending on the User-Agent. Google is automatically rejecting User-Agents that seem to originate from a possible automated bot. [Part of the Google error page: Please see Google's Terms of Service posted at http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html ] A typical example would be using the command line browser cURL, Google will directly reject to serve any pages to it while Bing is a bit more forgiving, Bing does not seem to care about User-Agents. * Google is using a complex system of request rate limitation which is different for each Language, Country, User-Agent as well as depending on the keyword and keyword search parameters. The rate limitation can make it unpredictable when accessing a search engine automated as the behaviour patterns are not known to the outside developer or user. * Network and IP limitations are as well part of the scraping defense systems. Search engines can not easily be tricked by changing to another IP, while using proxies is a very important part in successful scraping. The diversity and abusive history of an IP is important as well. * Offending IPs and offending IP networks can easily be stored in a blacklist database to detect offenders much faster. The fact that most ISPs give dynamic IP addresses to customers requires that such automated bans be only temporary, to not block innocent users. * Behaviour based detection is the most difficult defense system. Search engines serve their pages to millions of users every day, this provides a large amount of behaviour information. A scraping script or bot is not behaving like a real user, aside from having non-typical access times, delays and session times the keywords being harvested might be related to each other or include unusual parameters. Google for example has a very sophisticated behaviour analyzation system, possibly using deep learning software to detect unusual patterns of access. It can detect unusual activity much faster than other search engines. * HTML markup changes, depending on the methods used to harvest the content of a website even a small change in HTML data can render a scraping tool broken until it was updated. * General changes in detection systems. In the past years search engines have tightened their detection systems nearly month by month making it more and more difficult to reliable scrape as the developers need to experiment and adapt their code regularly.  Detection  When search engine defense thinks an access might be automated the search engine can react differently. The first layer of defense is a captcha page where the user is prompted to verify he is a real person and not a bot or tool. Solving the captcha will create a cookie that permits access to the search engine again for a while. After about one day the captcha page is removed again. The second layer of defense is a similar error page but without captcha, in such a case the user is completely blocked from using the search engine until the temporary block is lifted or the user changes his IP. The third layer of defense is a longterm block of the entire network segment. Google has blocked large network blocks for months. This sort of block is likely triggered by an administrator and only happens if a scraping tool is sending a very high number of requests. All these forms of detection may also happen to a normal user, especially users sharing the same IP address or network class (IPV4 ranges as well as IPv6 ranges).  Methods of scraping Google, Bing or Yahoo  To scrape a search engine successfully the two major factors are time and amount. The more keywords a user needs to scrape and the smaller the time for the job the more difficult scraping will be and the more developed a scraping script or tool needs to be. Scraping scripts need to overcome a few technical challenges: * IP rotation using Proxies (proxies should be unshared and not listed in blacklists) * Proper time management, time between keyword changes, pagination as well as correctly placed delays Effective longterm scraping rates can vary from only 3‚Äì5 requests (keywords or pages) per hour up to 100 and more per hour for each IP address / Proxy in use. The quality of IPs, methods of scraping, keywords requested and language/country requested can greatly affect the possible maximum rate. * Correct handling of URL parameters, cookies as well as HTTP headers to emulate a user with a typical browser *HTML DOM parsing (extracting URLs, descriptions, ranking position, sitelinks and other relevant data from the HTML code) * Error handling, automated reaction on captcha or block pages and other unusual responses * Captcha definition explained as mentioned above by An example of an open source scraping software which makes use of the above mentioned techniques is GoogleScraper. This framework controls browsers over the DevTools Protocol and makes it hard for Google to detect that the browser is automated.  Programming languages  When developing a scraper for a search engine almost any programming language can be used. Although, depending on performance requirements, some languages will be favorable. PHP is a commonly used language to write scraping scripts for websites or backend services, since it has powerful capabilities built-in (DOM parsers, libcURL); however, its memory usage is typically 10 times the factor of a similar C/C++ code. Ruby on Rails as well as Python are also frequently used to automated scraping jobs. For highest performance, C++ DOM parsers should be considered. Additionally, bash scripting can be used together with cURL as a command line tool to scrape a search engine.  Tools and scripts When developing a search engine scraper there are several existing tools and libraries available that can either be used, extended or just analyzed to learn from. * iMacros - A free browser automation toolkit that can be used for very small volume scraping from within a users browser * cURL ‚Äì a commandline browser for automation and testing as well as a powerful open source HTTP interaction library available for a large range of programming languages. * GoogleScraper ‚Äì A Python module to scrape different search engines (like Google, Yandex, Bing, Duckduckgo, Baidu and others) by using proxies (socks4/5, http proxy). The tool includes asynchronous networking support and is able to control real browsers to mitigate detection.  Legal  When scraping websites and services the legal part is often a big concern for companies, for web scraping it greatly depends on the country a scraping user/company is from as well as which data or website is being scraped. With many different court rulings all over the world. However, when it comes to scraping search engines the situation is different, search engines do usually not list intellectual property as they just repeat or summarize information they scraped from other websites. The largest public known incident of a search engine being scraped happened in 2011 when Microsoft was caught scraping unknown keywords from Google for their own, rather new Bing service. () But even this incident did not result in a court case. One possible reason might be that search engines like Google are getting almost all their data by scraping millions of public reachable websites, also without reading and accepting those terms. A legal case won by Google against Microsoft would possibly put their whole business as risk.

He was a son of Paerisades and the youngest brother of Satyros II and Eumelos. He was part of the Bosporan Civil War during 309 BC, between himself and his brothers, Eumelos having a claim to the throne and backing of Aripharnes, king of the Siraces. Reign and defeat Not much is known about Prytanis prior to the civil war, but he was the youngest son of Paerisades, and thus last in line of succession, and sided with his eldest brother Satyros when Eumelos launched his rival claim for the throne. Upon Satyros' death, his mercenary captain Meniscus brought the body back to Panticapaeum through Gargaza. Here, Prytanis held a great funeral for his elder brother and quickly went to Gargaza, taking both the army and royal power. Eumelos sent envoys to Prytanis, but he ignored them and left a garrison in Gargaza so that he could quickly return to Panticapaeum in order to secure the throne for himself. While Prytanis was in Panticapaeum, Eumelos took Gargaza and several other cities. Prytanis then took the field against his brother near the Maeotic Lake, but was defeated and Eumelos forced him to turn over command of the army and abdicate in his favor. Death Having already given Eumelos the throne, Prytanis once again entered Panticapaeum. As he walked through it, he knew that it had been the capital of his ancestors and presumably wanted his throne back. After attempting to take the throne, he was overpowered and fled to \\"The Gardens\\" where he was cornered and killed. Eumelos, to secure his throne, killed the families and friends of Satyros and Prytanis, with Satyros's young son Paerisades only barely managing to get away to Scythia and getting refuge with Agarus.

Their authority is only recognised in the Usuli branch of Twelver Shi'ism. Title Currently, maraji' are accorded the title Grand Ayatollah (  æƒÄyatullƒÅh al-  øU·∫ìmƒÅ; Ayatoll√¢h-e Ozm√¢). Previously, the titles of Allamah (such as Allameh Tabatabaei, Allameh Majlesi, Allameh Hilli) and Imam (such as Imam Khomeini, Imam Rohani, Imam Shirazi and Imam Sadr) have also been used.  Role  From the perspective of Usuli jurisprudence, during the occultation of the Mahdi, Shia hawzah clerics are his representatives, with responsibility for understanding and explaining Islamic religious jurisprudence. Shiite authorities in the history of Shi'ism have an important role in the religious, political and social thought of their communities. One example is the fatwa of Mirza Mohammed Hassan Husseini Shirazi imposing sanctions on the use of tobacco during Qajar rule, which led to the abolition of the tobacco concession. Authority The title of an ayatollah transpires when he becomes a celebrated figure in the hawza and his students and followers trust him in answering their questions, and ask him to publish a juristic book, the risalah amaliyah‚Äîa manual of practical rulings arranged according to topics dealing with ritual purity, worship, social issues, business, and political affairs. The risalah contains an ayatollah's fatwas on different topics, according to his knowledge of the most authentic Islamic sources and their application to current life. Traditionally only the most renowned ayatollahs of the given time published a risalah. Today, however, many ayatollahs of varying degrees of illustriousness have published one, while some of the renowned ones have refused to do so. Where a difference in opinion exists between the maraji', each of them provides their own opinion and the muqallid will follow their own marja's opinion on that subject. A mujtahid, i.e. someone who has completed advanced training (dars kharij) in the hawza and has acquired the license to engage in ijtihad ( æijƒÅz al- æijtihƒÅd) from one or several ayatollahs, is exempted from the requirement to follow a marja'. However ijtihad is not always comprehensive and so a mujtahid may be an expert in one particular area of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and exercise ijtihad therein, but follow a marja' in other areas of fiqh. Several senior Grand Ayatollahs preside over hawzas, religious seminaries. The hawzas of Qom and Najaf are the preeminent seminary centers for the training of Shia clergymen. However, there are other smaller hawzas in many other cities around the world, the biggest ones being Karbala, Isfahan and Mashhad. There are 86 Maraji living worldwide as of 2017, mostly residing in Najaf and Qom. The most prominent among them are Ali Khamenei in Tehran; Hossein Vahid Khorasani, Mousa Shubairi Zanjani, Sayyid Sadeq Rohani, Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani, Naser Makarem Shirazi, Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, Hossein Noori Hamedani and Abdollah Javadi-Amoli in Qom; Ali al- Sistani, Muhammad al-Fayadh, Muhammad Saeed al-Hakim and Bashir al-Najafi in Najaf.

Harkin was a Union nurse during the American Civil War. In a letter to Mary G. Holland about her wartime experience, Harkin describes a spirit of excitement and enthusiasm on behalf of the nurses, soldiers, and civilians as the newly-enlisted members were traveling.  Civil War service  Not much is known about Harkin's life before the war, but on February 13, 1862, she traveled to Madison, Wisconsin State House to be commissioned as a volunteer nurse. The very next day, she was transferred to a local hospital for instruction. On February 17, Harkin and her mother Sarah A.M. Kenna began service with the 17th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. Harkin notes, however, that these individuals were in for a shock once they got to the fields. Harkin describes a measles outbreak early on in her wartime experience, which was not uncommon given the poor sanitary conditions of medical environments. The hardship only increased as the regiment was ordered to Shiloh. Upon arrival at the Shiloh front, the soldiers traveling with Harkin's regiment were initially ordered to bury those who had died in battle before even beginning service. According to Harkin's letter, the hardships only continued. The rations were inadequate, and nurses nearly starved--eating only hardtack--to save every scrap of food for the soldiers and the patients. A nurse's long night of caring for the wounded was augmented by cooking and cleaning duties. Even the nurses were susceptible to illness: Harkin writes about a fellow nurse and friend passing away and the effect it had on her. Harkin even mentions that they could not attain a coffin for the nurse, so a soldier fashioned one out of cracker boxes. Harkin and her mother soon answered a call for nurses in Corinth. Harkin mentions that the facilities at Corinth were much better, which helped soldiers recuperate faster. During her time at Corinth, Harkin was almost take as a spy by the Confederate Army while riding her horse. Harkin refused to be taken captive, flying back to camp on her horse to avoid the gunfire from the Confederates. Thankfully, Harkin survived the encounter unharmed. Unfortunately, Harkin ultimately had to leave the service due to her own poor health. She followed her mother north for service but remained and exited the regiment as her mother returned to Corinth.

His Mahaprasthana (1990) was said to be the result of his exploration of ways of transcending the constraints of modernism. It dealt with the theme of disillusionment after victory, with the mythological heavenward journey of the Pandavas as the setting.

It was led by Alfredo Stroessner, with the support of Epifanio M√©ndez Fleitas, and resulted in the overthrow of the government of Federico Ch√°vez. The coup was the culmination of a complex series of political rivalries within the ruling Colorado Party. Approximately 25 people were killed during the putsch, which helped set the stage for the election of Stroessner as president of Paraguay later that year. Background By the 1950s, social and political stability in Paraguay had been severely eroded due to more than two decades of crises, including the Second Paraguayan Civil War, the Chaco War, and the pro-Nazi Party sympathies of former president Higinio Mor√≠nigo. President Federico Ch√°vez, who had declared a state of siege and initiated a crackdown against his political opponents shortly after taking office, faced an uncertain economic situation in Paraguay and turned to Central Bank president Epifanio M√©ndez Fleitas to spearhead a national economic recovery. M√©ndez' attempts to convince Ch√°vez to seek support from the Argentine government of Juan Per√≥n proved unpopular with conservative elements of the Colorado Party and M√©ndez was pressured to resign in January 1954. Despite his departure, M√©ndez continued to enjoy support from some factions of the party, as well as Army Major Virgilio Candia, a deputy to cavalry commander Colonel N√©stor Ferreira. Ferreira was, himself, a strong supporter of President Ch√°vez. Beyond this rivalry between supporters of Ch√°vez and the supporters of M√©ndez, the so-called epifanistas, a secondary rivalry had begun to develop between the government and the Army due to the decision of Ch√°vez to outfit the National Police with heavy weaponry, which was met with the chagrin of the Army's commanding general Alfredo Stroessner. Coup On May 3, 1954, Ferreira ordered the arrest of Candia due to suspicions of his plotting against Ch√°vez. This provided the opportunity for Stroessner to propose an alliance between the Army and the epifanistas against the government. The coup got underway at about 8:00 p.m. on May 4, 1954, with an attack on police headquarters in Asunci√≥n by commandos from the Paraguayan Army's elite Battalion 40 led by Mario Ortega. During the assault, the young chief of police Roberto Pettit was shot and, though he was promptly evacuated by the attacking Army forces to a hospital, died from his wounds. President Ch√°vez initially sought refuge inside the Francisco L√≥pez Military College and offered to promote its director, Marcial Samaniego, to head of the Paraguayan Army. Samaniego, however, was an old friend of Stroessner and responded to the offer by immediately arresting Ch√°vez. During an emergency session of the Colorado Party leadership convened on May 5, Ch√°vez was requested to formally resign the presidency. The resignation of Ch√°vez resulted in Colorado Party chairman Tom√°s Romero Pereira becoming interim president. Aftermath The Colorado Party nominated Stroessner as their candidate for president in an election on July 11, which he won. The party saw Stroessner's presidency as a temporary solution to its internal bickering and indecision, and planned to eventually replace him. Stroessner had no base of support within the party, which was split between backers of Ch√°vez and backers of M√©ndez. Over the next three years, as part of an effort to consolidate his position, Stroessner worked to sideline leaders of both factions of the party. While M√©ndez was briefly reinstalled as president of the Central Bank by Stroessner, he was shortly thereafter again forced to resign. In 1955 he attempted to rally his supporters within the Army to overthrow Stroessner, but the plot failed and he was pressured to leave the country. Virgilio Candia was promoted to the post of his former boss, N√©stor Ferreira, as commander of the cavalry, but also faced dismissal along with other epifanista officers. The deposed president, Ch√°vez, was meanwhile sent to France as Paraguayan ambassador. Lt. Colonel Mario Ortega, commander of Battalion 40, was appointed the new chief of police, the first in a long line of Army personnel to head Paraguayan law enforcement. Nestor Ferreira was briefly jailed, but later released and given command of the reserve officer corps, a post he held until his retirement. The former interim president, Romero, would serve as a cabinet minister under Stroessner, who would lead Paraguay for 34 years.

It is a hill-fort of Garha Kingdom which is spread over hills in a forested area. Singorgarh fort is about 45 km from Jabalpur city, on the way to Damoh town. It was a magnificent fort and residence of Rajgond rulers of Central India. They spend some times of a year in Singorgarh fort. At present, fort is in a ruined condition with no caretaker. It is located inside forest area and there is no proper road to reach the site. By looking at current ruined site, one can realize that during its peak days, thousands of people were living here and fort was spread over large area and many watch towers are still visible in this area. There is pond also in hill-top which was basically for water arrangement. During last war of Garha Kingdom dynasty, under rule of Rani Durgavati, fort received major blow of first attack in June-1564. During those days, Rani Durgavati was staying in same Singorgarh Fort and later shifted to Chouragarh fort of Narsinghpur.  History  Before coming in hand of Gond rulers, Singorgarh fort was under Chandel rulers in 1308. It was Gond ruler Sangram shah who conquered the Singorgarh fort in early period of 16th century. Sangram Shah was a powerful Gond ruler and was Father in Law of Rani Durgavati. It was year 1564 when Mughal army, led by Asaf Khan (from Kunda, Uttar Pradesh), with assistance of Rewa rulers, attacked the Gond Kingdom. In those days, Mughal ruler Akbar ordered his general Asaf Khan of Kunda, to attack the Gond dynasty as he was jealous of Gond dynasty's prosperity and sovereignty. In summers of year 1564, Mughal army reached Gond kingdom border. During that time, Rani Durgavati was ruling the kingdom and was present in same Singorgarh fort. When she came to know about the huge army of more than 70,000 soldiers, she decided to leave the fort and shifted to Garha fort of Jabalpur and major war took place in this area. While marching towards Jabalpur, Mughal army first reached Singorgarh fort and attacked here in which fort was badly damaged and since then, although ruled but never gained its previous prosperity and gleam.

Personal life and early career As a child, Yen Ching-piao earned the nickname \\"winter melon-piao\\" from his grandfather for his short stature and stocky build. Yen married at age 17, and had children, including son Yen Kuan-heng and daughter Yen Li-ming. Yen was linked to organized crime in 1986 and imprisoned on Green Island for over three years. Upon his release, Yen was elected a borough leader, and, in 1994, was elected to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, becoming the body's youngest member. He later served on the Taichung County Council, including a stint as speaker. Yen was expelled from the Kuomintang in April 2000, after having publicly backed James Soong's presidential campaign the previous month. Yen assumed the chairmanship of the Dajia Jenn Lann Temple in January 1999, and used his position to push for direct travel from Taiwan to mainland China. He has become known for leading the Dajia Matsu pilgrimage, a temple event often attended by politicians. Yen has also served as honorary chairman of the Taiwan Mazu Fellowship. Legislative service and later career Yen was detained on 28 February 2001, while still serving as the speaker of the Taichung County Council. He was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on 31 August 2001. Yen won a Taichung County legislative seat while serving a prison sentence for corruption, attempted murder, and firearms possession. While serving the sentence, Yen was also barred from leaving Taiwan, a restriction the Taiwan High Court refused to lift, even after Yen had been named to a delegation that was to visit Central America and the United States in April 2002. During his 2004 reelection campaign, Yen and other candidates filed an unsuccessful petition to change the election date from 11 December to 4 December. That year, Yen joined a formal political party for the first time after his expulsion from the Kuomintang, co-founding the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union and running as an NPSU candidate. In December, Yen's assistant Liu Sung-wu was taken in for questioning over electoral fraud, a charge Yen himself denied. Soon after winning reelection, Yen was named party caucus whip. His 2008 campaign, which featured heavy use of self- caricature, saw Yen win reelection against educator Lee Shun-liang. In his third term in the legislature, Yen opposed a proposal to specially designate Taoyuan International Airport as a separately administered entity unless Kaohsiung International Airport and Ching Chuan Kang Airport in his own constituency also received the designation. On 10 August 2008, Yen's office was the site of a shooting which injured two people. The Taiwan High Court ruled in September 2011 that Yen was guilty of misusing public funds during his tenure on the Taichung County Council. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court ruling in November 2012. Yen then spent most of January 2013 on the campaign trail, as his son had declared his candidacy to succeed the elder Yen to the Legislative Yuan. This arrangement attracted criticism, and following his son's electoral victory, Yen began serving a prison sentence of 42 months in February 2013. In June 2013 an amendment to the Accounting Act originally considered in 2012 was brought forward for further discussion. The amendment would have ended financial impropriety investigations into city and county council members, potentially shortening Yen Ching-piao's imprisonment because the offense he was jailed for occurred between 1998 and 2000, when he was a member of the Taichung County Council. The initiative failed unanimously, with three abstentions. Legislator Liao Cheng-ching proposed a bill that would not have applied to the terms of Yen's sentence in December 2013, but instead Yen applied for parole in June 2014, which was granted in four days. He publicly supported Hau Lung-bin in the 2017 Kuomintang chairmanship election.

He had a long career of notable distinction as a lawyer spanning more than 50 years. He was one of the first people in the province of New Brunswick, and the first resident of Shediac, New Brunswick, to own and operate an automobile. He purchased his first vehicle in 1908, a sports model McLaughlin Buick, sporting license plate No. 111. In 1926, both the United States Patent and Canadian Patent Offices issued similar patents to McDonald for a board game called Crossword Game. The wood tile game featuring letters of the alphabet with point value was played on a checker board and predates the first version of Scrabble by 12 years.  Early life, education, family and recreation  Edward R. McDonald was born in Pointe-du-Ch√™ne, New Brunswick in 1871 to Captain William McDonald and Catherine Costello McDonald. His father was of Irish descent and he was raised in the Catholic faith. He had an older sister, named Eliza born in 1870. He also had two half-brothers: Huntley and William McDonald. It is quite possible that his mother died during his childhood. Since his father was a sea captain, he and his sister were raised by their aunt Eliza and her husband Patrick Sweeney who was a Deputy Sheriff. He attended public school and high school in Shediac, New Brunswick. He would then follow his father's calling of the sea for three years, serving before the mast on large ships, visiting many ports around the world, an experience which he considered gave him training and a greater conception of life. After leaving the sea, he enrolled in a course of advance learning at St. Joseph's College in Memramcook, New Brunswick. After graduation, he began to study law in the office of James McQueen, (King's Counsel) in Shediac, NB. Following his apprenticeship, he was admitted to the Bar of New Brunswick. But before committing to his new career as a lawyer, he travelled to Florida where he engaged in the real estate market for one year. He then made his way to Leadville, Colorado where he was employed in the gold mines for a couple of years before heading north of the border to Alberta to engage in ranching. He then became a gold mining prospector for a year in Porcupine, Ontario. In 1908, he co-wrote a science fiction novel, The Mad Scientist: A Tale of the Future, with Raymond Alfred L√©ger. The book was published under the joint pen name of Raymond McDonald. The story line follows the increasingly dangerous interventions of the Mad Scientist in the dealings of US businessmen and of the US Government itself. The scientist's inclinations are socialist but, the authors are ambiguous about whether or not he is a menace. Many uncomfortable revelations ‚Äì from fraud to conspiracies with German strikebreakers brought into the open by the scientist's numerous inventions, which include an anti- gravity device capable of levitating battleships to escape enemy torpedoes. Raymond L√©ger was a highly literate man who developed Jules Verne-like concepts of travel, rockets, spaceships and houses with wings. At the age of 39, he married Annie Gertrude Ryan, age 21 on April 30, 1912. Their nuptials took place in Saint John, NB, the hometown of his bride. Raymond Alfred L√©ger, with whom he co-wrote the science fiction novel 4 years earlier was a witness at their wedding. They had four children, one son- Edward Ronald (b.1920) and three daughters- Gertrude, Dorothy Mildred (b.1914) and Elizabeth (Betty), b. 1926‚Äì27?). Beside motoring, he was an avid sailor / yachtsman. The Shediac Bay Yacht Club was founded in 1933 by Donald Cowl of New York / Shediac Cape, NB and Hal Weldon, a Montreal banker and Shediac area native. McDonald was among the first directors of the club which also included Allan S. Tait and Donald S. Smith. The late Senator J. Anthony McDonald of Shediac and Toronto was his cousin. Edward McDonald is the great-grandfather of Oscar-winning director, screenwriter and Disney animator Chris Williams, and Todd McLellan, a former professional ice hockey player, Stanley Cup winning assistant-coach with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008, and current head coach of the Edmonton Oilers hockey team.  Law practice  McDonald long enjoyed a province-wide reputation in New Brunswick as a lawyer, being regarded as among the ablest appearing in criminal and civil courts. During his career, he acquired knowledge in all other branches of the law. His practice embraced all the courts from the lowest to the highest. During the 1930s he was appointed a King's Counsel. As a counsel, his services were retained in many cases. He remained active as a barrister in the province of New Brunswick and on many occasions before the Nova Scotia Courts for the remaining of his life, until a few months prior to his death when illness struck. Political life Conjointly with his law practice, he was also a very active politician on the local and provincial scene. He served as mayor of Shediac, NB for three terms (1908‚Äì1911, 1915‚Äì1916, 1926‚Äì1929) as well as an alderman on the Shediac Town council for two decades. During his first mandate as mayor, the wharf in Pointe-du-Ch√™ne, NB was built in 1910‚Äì11. In addition, he also served as town clerk for many year and councillor for the Shediac Parish at Westmorland Municipality Council for sixteen years. In provincial politics, he was elected in 1935 as a Liberal member to the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Westmorland County, serving a four-year term during which he played a prominent role in the debates of the House and served in several committees.  Crossword Game  In 1925, McDonald invented a board game called Crossword Game. The wood tile game featuring letters of the alphabet with point value was played on a checker board. He hired the patent agency, Fetherstonhaugh & Co of Toronto to prepare the patent submissions. His Crossword Game was granted a US patent, number 1591639 on July 6, 1926, and a Canadian Patent, number CA266459 on December 7, 1926. McDonald's Crossword Game predates the first version of the Scrabble Word Game by 12 years, although the two games are not known to be related. The initial version of the Scrabble Word Game was invented in 1938 by American architect Alfred Mosher Butts and was called Lexiko. The version that would later become available commercially was revised by James Brunot in 1948. Edward McDonald's Crossword Game does differ significantly from Scrabble. The board is 13 spaces square for the Crossword Game compared to 15 spaces square for Scrabble. Each player has a set of 26 letter tiles, featuring the entire alphabet. Each set of tiles are of different colours. At the beginning of the game, the tiles are positioned in the two rows nearest each player, similar to chess pieces. Consonants have various point values as indicated on the tiles, while vowels have no point values. The players form words by moving tiles. Consonants are removed when a word has been formed and the score recorded. Vowels remain in place for the duration of the game. Players score double the point value for the use of an opponent letter in forming a new word. The complete instructions for the game are quite complex and are printed on 3 pages. It remains unknown if McDonald's Crossword Game was ever marketed since no original prototype are known to exist. McDonald's daughter, Betty Carvell. who was born around the same year the game was invented recalls during her childhood that family acquaintances would come to their house to play on a wooden board game with letter tiles on the kitchen table with her father. The Scrabble-like board game invented by McDonald is documented by various sources, including the Province of New Brunswick website, the New Brunswick Book of Everything, and New Brunswick Facts, Firsts & Innovations. It was only in 2014, when Pierre Cormier, a member of the Chamber of commerce for the town of Shediac, initiated a search that eventually led to the find of the patents themselves. Until then, the connection with the Crossword Game with the small town of Shediac had remained untold. In 2016, the town of Shediac would pay homage to McDonald by organizing several activities to celebrate the 90th anniversary of his Crossword Game. The Chamber of Commerce commissioned a narrative painting of the inventor and his game that was created by Canadian artist Alvin Richard. During a press conference held on June 8, 2016 in Shediac, John Chew, co- president of the North American Scrabble Players Association announced that Hasbro, the current owner of the Scrabble Game, would be supplying a large number of games to the town to demonstrate their support for the initiative. Many Scrabble-related activities were revealed for the summer and fall of 2016. The town of Shediac would go on to form the first certified Scrabble Club in the Atlantic provinces, and hosted an International Scrabble Tournament from September 30 to October 2, with Mr Chew presiding over the event. The first tournament was won by Jackson Smylie of Toronto, a co-winner of the North American Scrabble Championship for students in 2011. On September 17, Shediac hosted a roaring 1920s Gatsby themed night in conjunction with Scrabble related activities, highlighting the flapper fashion period when McDonald's game was invented. Shediac is known as the Lobster Capital of the World and has recently claimed the title of The Scrabble Capital of Canada. Giant black and white letter tiles spelling \\"Shediac\\" were installed at the western entrance of the town alongside the 90-ton sculpture called (perhaps inaccurately) The World's Largest Lobster. In conjunction with the celebration of Canada's 150th Birthday, \\"Ingenious\\", a book written by the Governor General of Canada, his Excellency The Right Honourable David Johnston and Tom Jenkins was released on March 27, 2017. Edward R. McDonald's Crossword Game is included in an article entitled, \\"Wood-tile Crossword\\". The illustrated volume celebrates Canadian innovations whose widespread adoption has made the world a better place.  Death  Edward R. McDonald died on Saturday February 16, 1952 at his home in Shediac, of general arterio-sclerosis.

Highway 40D connects Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. It forms most of the highway corridor between Mazatl√°n and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, one of 14 major highway corridors in the country. Mazatl√°n-Durango Highway 40D begins at a junction with Mexican Federal Highway 15D at Villa Uni√≥n, Sinaloa, southeast of Mazatl√°n. The first toll plaza is located at the next interchange, serving the village of Mesillas. The road winds through the area known as the Espinazo del Diablo‚Äîthe Devil's Backbone‚Äîwith many bridges and tunnels on the route. The Santa Luc√≠a Bridge Highway 40D crosses the Baluarte River and the Sinaloa-Durango state line on the Baluarte Bridge, then the world's tallest cable-stayed bridge, which was formally inaugurated in January 2012. Several exits provide access to nearby villages, but the only town of size, for which Highway 40D serves as a bypass, is El Salto, the seat of Pueblo Nuevo Municipality. Past El Salto, the terrain slowly flattens, and the Durango-Mazatl√°n stretch ends with one more toll plaza west of Durango, for a total of four on the route. The Baluarte Bridge in March 2012, shortly after inauguration The construction of a highway from Mazatl√°n to Durango was deemed by the SCT in 2008 to be the \\"largest project in Mexican highway history\\" and by President Felipe Calder√≥n to be the \\"most complex highway in the world\\". The highway crosses some of Mexico's most hazardous terrain, with 68 tunnels and 115 bridges‚Äîincluding the Baluarte Bridge, then the tallest cable-stayed bridge in the world‚Äîwhich accounts for 70 percent of the road's distance. Additionally, land had to be acquired from local ejidatarios, who complained that they were being paid too little for their land. The final of the highway was inaugurated by Enrique Pe√±a Nieto on October 17, 2013, bringing to an end twelve years of construction at a project cost that grew 195 percent. At that time, Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE), an agency of the federal government, took over maintenance and operations of the so-called \\"superhighway\\" (supercarretera). Puente El Carrizo Since the road's completion, several issues have plagued the highway. In 2015, CAPUFE closed the P√°nuco Tunnel at kilometer 185, stating that it was in danger of collapsing. That same year, the Coscomate toll plaza was taken over for 141 days, causing the loss of MXN$80 million in toll revenues. The highway closure affected truckers, who noted that transportation costs would increase during the closure because free Mexican Federal Highway 40 could not handle 53-foot trucks, which had to detour through Guadalajara and Torre√≥n to reach Durango. Drivers said they preferred to use the older road at night because of the many potholes that had developed; while CAPUFE pledged hundreds of millions of pesos in repair work and storm water management, that never materialized. Portions of the El Carrizo bridges also required structural reinforcement, with the SCT carrying out repairs in the Sinaloa portion of the route. CAPUFE charges a total toll of MXN$536 to travel from Durango to Mazatl√°n on Federal Highway 40D, at its four toll plazas. Libramiento de Durango Highway 40D is routed around Durango on the northern Datos Viales ‚Äì Durango , SCT, 2016 of the Libramiento Perif√©rico de Durango, which circles the city and was inaugurated in August 2012. Durango-G√≥mez Palacio ACSA (Autopistas de Cuota, S.A.), a subsidiary of Coconal, holds the concessions for the three separate (but contiguous) roads connecting Durango to the Comarca Lagunera and bypassing its cities of G√≥mez Palacio and Torre√≥n. Legally defined as two separate segments divided at Yerban√≠s of and , the concessions for Highway 40D from Durango to G√≥mez Palacio opened on September 23, 1993 and October 8, 1991, respectively. Highway 40D connects the two largest cities in the state of Durango, Durango City and G√≥mez Palacio, via Yerban√≠s. A section of this route, from Cuencam√© to G√≥mez Palacio, is co- signed as Mexican Federal Highway 49D to match the overlap of free highways 40 and 49 in the same area.

Saltillo-Monterrey Leaving Saltillo, the 40D designation returns again for the highway connecting Saltillo to Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n. Highway 40D closely parallels Highway 40, with its lone toll booth (Santa Catarina) placed before the junction with the Anillo Perif√©rico de Monterrey, which serves as the latter's western terminus and also provides access to Highway 40.

The church is dedicated to Trophimus of Arles. It houses relics of Saint Sophia (French: Sainte Sophie) since 777 and is a place of Christian pilgrimage, especially for members of the Russian Orthodox Church. It is classified as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1898. History Floor plan of the church (drawn between 1887 and 1901) The church was originally part of a Benedictine abbey founded by the bishop of Strasbourg, in 770. On 10 May 777, Remigius brought relics of Sophia and her daughters from Rome, where they had been given to him by Pope Adrian I. He dedicated the abbey to St Sophia, and the church both to Mary and St Trophimus. Remigius died on 23 March 783 and was buried in the church. The church was destroyed by the Hungarians in 926. It was rebuilt in 996 by bishop . In 1143, the number of pilgrims to the relics was so considerable that abbess Chunegundis (Cunigunde) initiated the construction of a hospital on the ancient Roman road near the abbey. Around that time, an ornate cloister was added, with capitals and other sculptures from the workshop of the Master of Eschau. The church was again damaged in 1298, during a military campaign of Conrad of Lichtenberg against Adolf of Germany, and the Romanesque cloister was destroyed. The fa√ßade of the church was rebuilt shortly after. In 1526, bishop dismantled the abbey as a consequence of Protestant Reform and the German Peasants' War. The buildings remained the property of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Strasbourg, until Leopold V, Archduke of Austria sold them to the Grand Chapter of Strasbourg Cathedral for 20,942 guilder in 1615. The Grand Chapter used the residential buildings of the abbey as a winery. During the Thirty Years' War, the church was pillaged in 1632 by the Swedish troops under General Horn. In 1792, the buildings were confiscated by French Revolutionaries and the church was turned into an inn. The relics of Sophia and her daughters were dispersed. In 1822, all the buildings except the church were demolished. The church became the parish church of Eschau. Remains of the 12th-century cloister were found thanks to archaeological excavations in 1866, 1917, 1919 and 1929, and are shown in the Mus√©e de l‚Äô≈íuvre Notre-Dame in Strasbourg; some more fragments were found in 1987 and are kept in the town hall of Eschau. In the 1930s, a tradition of Russian Orthodox pilgrimage to the church was established, notably by the visit of archimandrite in 1937. The following year, 1938, bishop brought \\"new\\" relics of St Sophia from Rome, which had been authenticated by Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani. During World War II, the church was damaged again, in 1944‚àí45. It was thoroughly restored from 1958 until 1969. A new bell tower was built in 1987, behind the church. The installation of underfloor heating in 1995 brought other lost fragments to light, among them two sarcophagi.  Description  The church is of modest dimensions. Its present layout and volumes are reminiscent of the abbey church of Reichenau, and of St. Godehard, Hildesheim. Some of the features of the church have been much altered since its completion in the 11th century: the floor of the nave was originally some lower and the windows of the nave were much smaller. Conversely, other features, like the apse, have remained unchanged for 1,000 years. The inside displays several Gothic and Baroque statues of saints as well as Renaissance sculptures such as a head of John the Baptist on a platter, and ledger stones from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The choir window reuses a Gothic stained glass panel originally from the former Dominican church of Strasbourg, destroyed in 1870.

His appointment as Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) in 2014 and the resultant refusal of his predecessor, Kennedy Tlali Kamoli to evacuate the post, ignited a season of political instability in Lesotho. After Kamoli's return to the post, Mahao was murdered by soldiers under suspicious circumstances.  Life  Mahao was born the sixth of seven children. His father was a public servant and a socialist. Maaparankoe Mahao attended Mokema Primary School from 1976 and St. Joseph's High School in Maseru from 1982. He joined the Lesotho Patriotic Youth Organisation (LPYO), which opposed the ruling military government under General Justin Metsing Lekhanya. At the National University of Lesotho he earned a Bachelor of Law in 1992 and an LL.B. in 1994. He was President of the Committee for Action and Solidarity for South African Students (CASSAS) as well as President of the Students' Representative Council (SRC). He co-founded the Lesotho Youth Federation and in 1990/1991 was one of the founding members of the Popular Front for Democracy (PFD), of which he was a member until his death in 2014. = Joining the LDF = Mahao joined the Lesotho Defence Force in 1996 as a lawyer. His task was to professionalise the armed forces and in 1998 he was promoted to the rank of Captain. That same year, he married 'Mamphanya Mahao, with whom he had three sons. From 2002 to 2007 he served as the Commander of the Special Forces and distinguished himself during the evacuation of the National Assembly after attacks. He was promoted to Brigadier General and received the post of military attache in the Basotho embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 2012 he earned a Master of Peace Studies and Security in Africa from the University of Addis Ababa. In 2008 he was made Chief of Staff of the Southern African Development Community Planning Department at the SADC headquarters in Gaborone, Botswana. On 15 January 2014, Mahao was charged with indiscipline and \\"behaving in an unbecoming character of an officer, contrary to Section 75 of the Lesotho Defence Force Act 4, 1996\\" after reprimanding Commando Captain Tefo Hashatsi two days previously. Hashatsi had reportedly been inciting soldiers to rebel should a new commander be appointed, contrary to the law. Surprisingly, the event resulted in Mahao's suspension. = Events since 29 August 2014 = On 29 August 2014, Mahao was promoted to Lieutenant-General and appointed by Prime Minister Tom Thabane with the approval of King Letsie III to replace Tlali Kamoli as commander of the LDF. Kamoli had been dismissed for insubordination and refusing to hand over soldiers under his command accused of murder, attempted murder and robbery to the police. He refused to accept his demotion and remained in the post. Soldiers loyal to Kamoli carried out a series of attacks on police stations and high-ranking politicians' homes. Mahao's house was also peppered with bullets and his dog shot and killed, but he and the targeted politicians fled to South Africa, in what was widely deemed a coup- attempt by Kamoli. Pro- Kamoli soldiers claimed that Mahao could not legally be promoted to lieutenant-general, much less LDF commander, because he was still under suspension. The independent SADC commission of inquiry established under Botswana's Justice Mpaphi Phumaphi, would later deem Mahao's appointment by the Prime Minister as legal as the suspension had been quashed. Even after his return, Mahao was prevented from entering the barracks due to the tense situation, thereby preventing him from formally taking office. Sections of the army remained under Kamoli's control. SADC was called in to negotiate between the two sides, resulting in the snap election of February 2015. Kamoli, Mahao and the chief of police, Khothatso Tsooana, were ordered to leave the country in order to preserve the peace. Mahao was sent to South Sudan, Tsooana to Algeria and Kamoli to South Africa, after various countries refused to accommodate Kamoli for his role in the attempted coup. The talks were led by Vice-President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. The election resulted in a narrow win by the opposition and a 7-party coalition government was formed, led by Bethuel Pakalitha Mosisili's Democratic Congress (DC). In April 2015, Mahao received a letter declaring his appointment as LDF commander as well as his promotion to lieutenant-general null and void. Tlali Kamoli was restored to post. Mahao went to court to fight his demotion.  Murder of Mahao  On 25 June 2015 Mahao left his farm in Mokema with two nephews. According to the nephew's testimony and a letter written by Mahao's family to UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and other African leaders, his car was chased and stopped by three military vehicles. A group of men, including one dressed as a soldier, carrying AK-47 rifles shot at Mahao from the driver's side of his truck. The boys opened the passenger door but were suddenly stopped by soldiers. In the meantime, Lt. Gen. Mahao fell out of his truck through the open passenger door left open by his nephews. Soldiers then came around and dragged his bleeding body by his feet, face-down on tarred road and threw it into one of their trucks. Two vehicles drove off, while the third one stayed behind with the nephews. The two boys were held by soldiers who remained behind for approximately 40 minutes before they were released. One of the soldiers asked one of Mahao's nephews who they were and what they were doing with him. The nephew told the soldier that he was a student in a university in South Africa, and had come home for winter holidays. The soldier replied, \\"U tlo lija ha bohloko he?!\\", meaning the nephew was not going to enjoy the holidays. In the meantime, the soldier had made a call with his mobile phone, apparently reporting to his sender that \\"Re mo thuntse!\\", meaning they (soldiers) had shot Lt. Gen. Mahao. The soldier also mentioned on the phone that they were with a particular Sergeant. The soldiers then gave the boys an option to either return to Lt. Gen. Mahao's home and narrate what they had witnessed to Lt. Gen. Mahao's mother, or go to Maseru to report to his wife. The boys opted to go to Maseru. Driving the bloody truck with broken windows, the remaining army truck drove the opposite direction, only to catch up with the boys shortly after, finding them on the roadside standing outside the truck, fearing a possibility of explosives in the truck. Soldiers rebuked them and ordered them to keep going, which they did while the army truck followed them until passing and leaving them on the road. The exact time of Mahao's death is unclear. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement to condemn the murder of Mahao the following day, on 26 June 2015, and demanded a full investigation. The SADC set up a special commission of inquiry, led by High Court Judge of Botswana Mpathi Phumathi. Two SADC doctors and a third appointed by the Mahao family performed an autopsy and declared that Mahao had been shot eleven times in the head, chest and arms with automatic weapons. The Ministry of Defence claimed that Mahao had been killed in a special operation to round-up suspected military mutineers \\"following a confrontation\\" with the soldiers. Mahao's family criticised the government for \\"deliberately distorting information\\" surrounding the attack. Mahao's brother, vice- chancellor of the National University of Lesotho (NUL) and former Dean at Witwatersrand University in South Africa, stated in a public address that \\"We expected government to condemn General Mahao's murder and order the immediate arrest of perpetrators of this foul act. It has done neither, and seems to treat the grieving family and the nation with disdain.\\" Thousands of Basotho, including Queen Masenate, Chief Mathealira Seeiso (uncle of King Letsie III) and many employees of the National University of Lesotho, attended Mahao's funeral on 11 July in Mokema. Local radio station Harvest FM was prevented from broadcasting the ceremony live to listeners, allegedly by the government. = Phumaphi Commission = The final report of the Phumaphi Commission was made available in November 2015, but the government refused to receive or publish the report, claiming that interviewing witnesses outside the borders of Lesotho is a breach of legal procedure. The commission had interviewed, as part of its investigations, the three opposition leaders living in exile in South Africa. On 14 December, Prime Minister Mosisili declared that the government would continue to refuse to receive the report until the High Court had settled a case by Lieutenant-Colonel Tefo Hashatsi, implicated in the assassination, challenging the legitimacy of the SADC inquiry. Hashatsi gave testimony to the commission between 31 August and 23 October 2015. In February 2016, the report was finally published. The commission called for the immediate removal of Tlali Kamoli as head of the army among other recommendations. Kamoli remained in the post until he was forced into retirement in November 2016. He was succeeded on 1 December 2016 by his deputy Lt-Gen Khoantle Motsomotso. In January 2017, the Mahao family appealed to the SADC to oppose the government's handling of the murder investigation. In particular, they opposed the Amnesty Bill introduced in the National Assembly in November 2016 that would grant impunity for all crimes committed by security forces between 2007 and 2015. Professor Nqosa Mahao stated that \\"The Bill is a hardly veiled and cynical attempt by the government to protect and reward perpetrators of heinous crimes. The Bill is an affront to the rule of law and a license for impunity. It is yet again the clearest statement by the government that it is not intent on holding rogue elements in the LDF to account and amply captures the contempt with which it holds the international community.\\"  References  1968 births 2015 deaths Sotho people Military of Lesotho ","title":"Maaparankoe Mahao"},{"id":"53664449","text":"USS LST-454 was a United States Navy used in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during World War II.

The site may have been a feature in Mesolithic and Neolithic times, since finds include worked flints from these periods; they are thought to have been in their original location, as the site has not been ploughed.

However, it was just a screen for his mafia-like organization in the underworld of Hanoi during the late 1990s. Described as a cold-blooded assassin with an elegant appearance, Khanh Trang was the president of the Labor Union during his heyday, in which he ruled the trading in Dong Xuan market area (Hanoi). He also used his influence to fuel his other crimes, such as extortion from the traders and businesses in the market, murder and tax evasion. His nickname (White Khanh) simply derived from his fair complexion.  Early life  Khanh Trang was born as Duong Van Khanh in 1956 to a long family of 11 siblings, where he was the youngest child. His father had 3 different wives, while his mother also had 3 different husbands, so he and his siblings were a part of 3 separate families. His brother and father were well-educated and earn an honest living. It is said that when his father was still alive, Khanh was never acknowledged as a member of the Duong family. From a young age, Khanh lived with his mother and his half-sister on Kim Ma street (Ba Dinh district, Hanoi). The Duong family was poor though, and they relied mainly on state subsidies to survive. Khanh had four brothers who shared the same mother with him. Three of them had been arrested several times for theft and assault. Khanh studied through the fifth grade before he eventually dropped out of school. Later, he worked at Sao Vang rubber factory for 8 months. Between quitting his job to 1989, Khanh committed several offenses and was released from prison after serving 5 convictions. In 1989, Khanh purchased many pedicabs, which he used to transport goods around Long Bien bridge to pay daily rent. From there, Khanh began to form a gang of about three dozen juniors, all of whom were criminals, to transport goods in order to make a living. Around the same time in the area of Dong Xuan market and the surrounding areas, several other gangs began to drive pedicabs to transport goods as well. When Khanh's gang grew stronger, Khanh quickly occupied the areas of Tran Nhat Duat and Hang Chieu in order to expand the influence of his gang. This was considered a risky and clever move of Khanh.  Become the president of the Worker‚Äôs Union and rule over Dong Xuan market  In early 1991, the People's Committee of Dong Xuan promulgated the policies for the loading and unloading of goods in Dong Xuan market. Thus, Khanh went asked for permission to form a team of self-loading and unloading services in the area. The People's Committee agreed and set up a team, appointing Khanh as their leader, with deputies Nguyen Van Son and Nguyen Van Tuan becoming Khanh's right-hand men. Three months later, the People's Committee of Hoan Kiem district gave Khanh permission to handle the loading and unloading services in the market. By 1992, Dong Xuan union and the Labor Union were established as the first non-state trade organization in Hanoi. Khanh was later elected as the chairman of the Worker‚Äôs Union. When Khanh officially became the chairman of Dong Xuan Worker‚Äôs Union (with about 500 people), small-time traders within Dong Xuan market and traders from other markets often saw Khanh riding a jeep with several bodyguards. At first, the team's handling of loading and unloading services was quite nice, and they even received praise by government leaders who saw the organization as a good example to follow. However, Khanh thought Dong Xuan market area didn't have enough room for business, so he sought to expand his influence to other areas. Misusing his power as the chairman of the Worker‚Äôs Union, Khanh became a dictator around the Dong Xuan region, as he forced the businesses there to pay taxes and punished whoever didn't abide by his draconian policies. Khanh also prevented any other groups from loading and unloading their cargos of goods within the region, allowing only members of his union to do so, and even then the members were forced to give him the entire proceeds from the cargo load. Small businesses that refused to allow Khanh‚Äôs officers to load their goods were physically beaten by the gang. Particularly, the gang even robbed right in front of a store owner without interference from the bystanders, who feared retaliation if they spoke up. In 1994, there was a great fire in Dong Xuan market, which significantly reduced the activity of the businesses in the area. As a result, Khanh began to encroach to the areas around the bus station and Long Bien market, which was under the control of Hung Cuba. Khanh attempted to negotiate with Hung Cuba for control over these areas, but the two didn't come to an agreement. In response, Khanh had his men block all of the routes to the bus station and Long Bien market. Unable to transport or receive any of his goods from shippers, Hung Cuba was forced to submit to Khanh‚Äôs will. In order to legalize his operations, Khanh developed the trade unions in Hung Cuba's group and then merged the two trading organizations together, allowing him to transport goods from Dong Xuan and Long Bien markets. With his cover in place, Khanh continued to break the law, such as setting up a group of men to inspect other nearby trading groups, punish small traders, and fine business owners alongside Dong Xuan - Long Bien markets. The group set the fines themselves, after which the proceeds were delivered to Khanh. However, by using his ill- gotten gains for charitable acts, Khanh earned a good reputation as a kind- hearted benefactor, which helped him to conceal his illegal activities.  Murder at 44th street in Hang Chieu  One of the most publicized cases of Khanh‚Äôs murders was the murder of Dat at 44th street (in Hang Chieu, Hanoi). At that time, Dat was a trader at Dong Xuan market area who sold hats for a living. He soon came into conflict with Tran Dai Duong, a member of the Worker's Union who was appointed as a captain of the organization by Khanh. In the afternoon of 24 March 1991, Dat stabbed Duong with a knife but didn't seriously wound him, after which Dat fled from the market. Duong chased after Dat but was stopped by Nguyen Van Hung - Dat‚Äôs brother - and other traders in the area. Duong later stayed up to inform Khanh about the incident. With Dat‚Äôs knife in hand, Khanh ordered his men to carry Dat onto the pedicab to bring him to the police station in Dong Xuan and bring Duong to the hospital as well. However, when they arrived at the police station, Dat was dead. That night, Khanh summoned the young men who were involved in the fight to his mother‚Äôs home on Ton Duc Thang street, where he threatened them to pin the blame on Vu Quoc Dung as the one who robbed Dat‚Äôs knife and killed him. Vu Quoc Dung confessed the murder, and the police dropped the case for several years until Khanh‚Äôs arrest in 1996.  Tax Investigation  Though Khanh was extremely wealthy, he didn't pay any taxes or fees to the State. When the Tax Department of Hoan Kiem requested to declare the turnover and tax payment to the State, Khanh ordered one of his men to handle the tasks. At the Long Bien area, Khanh neither declared nor paid his taxes. From 1994 to May 1996, Khanh reported to the Tax Department that the revenue from his earnings was over 740 million VND, thus he ended up paying only the total turnover tax and income tax for 3 years of over 62 million VND. Meanwhile, during the search of Khanh‚Äôs house after his arrest, public security agencies obtained documents which proved that his revenue in 8 days was nearly 110 million. In other words, his revenue was nearly 14 million VND per day. Later, according to the calculation of Hanoi Tax Department, from 1992 to May 1996, Khanh's total revenue was over 5.5 billion. Khanh had deceived the tax department by not reporting his turnovers by more than 4.8 billion VND, evading taxes of more than 350 million VND in total.  Arrest and Execution  On 24 May 1996, Khanh Trang and several members of his organization were arrested at Khanh‚Äôs house on Nguyen Thiep street in Hanoi. In trial, Khanh was charged with murder, robbery, tax evasion and concealment of crime. According to the law, Khanh had to be sentenced to death for the crimes and was ordered to pay the State nearly 3.9 billion VND, which included a 3.5 billion fine, 350 million of taxes, court fees and compensation for the victims. With all the evidence against him presented, Khanh accepted the death sentence. On 13 October 1998, Duong Van Khanh was executed by the firing squad at Cau Nga shooting range in Hanoi, putting an end to his reign.

The movie follows the adventures of a group of super-powered space children who are called upon the emergence of an intergalactic threat. The movie was produced over a period of three years by UM Productions and was released direct to video. The movie has gained notoriety for its muddled plot, poor film quality and continuity errors, and its similarity to the Dragon Ball franchise.  Synopsis  In the year 2023, a group of super-powered space-faring warrior children called the Super Kids (or \\"Gokdari Group\\"), protect the Earth from interstellar monsters. Eunjoo, a reporter, is desperate to get a scoop for her news programme, so she decides to write a report on the Super Kids. Led by 199-year-old child warrior Gokdari, the Super Kids are in the middle of battling two rogue criminals, Wang Do Chi and Bazooka Joe who have captured a renowned scientist. The Super Kids' fight against the two criminals largely consists of torture and humiliation, resulting in Bazooka Joe losing his clothing and Wang Do Chi losing his teeth. After collecting a reward for the capture of the two criminals the Super Kids are visited by the police chief and captain of planet Delta who brief them on their next mission. They are ordered to arrest Judowgi, the most violent monster in the galaxy who sold his family for a box of gold and causes anyone who hears his name to recoil in fear. The kids board a robot-shaped spaceship bound for the planet X7 (or Ligel, depending on the character), with Eunjoo sneaking on board. After landing on the swamp planet and searching for their bounty on a flying carpet, the Super Kids encounter a group of the planet's native inhabitants, blasting a group of them before realising they are a friendly species. The natives tell Gokdari and the Super Kids of their enslavement to Judowgi, having to make regular sacrifices to the creature to feed him. The team then stage a plan to lure out Judowgi, disguising Gokdari as a sacrifice while Eunjoo documents the entire spectacle. Judowgi comes out of hiding as planned but the kids' attempts at capturing him fail, as Judowgi's protege Maio suddenly appears and battles the Super Kids. One by one the Super Kids are defeated by Maio, while Judowgi kidnaps Eunjoo and escapes. Maio warns Gokdari that the Captain's warrant for Judowgi is merely a ruse, and warns of Cacuruse, Judowgi's rival who merely waits for his defeat so he can take Judowgi's fortune for himself. He also tells Gokdari that the Captain is Cacuruse in disguise and that the Super Kids must defeat him before trying to battle Judowgi again. Gokdari and Rockpile leave for the planet Delta, while Big Boy and Samachi remain on X7 to look for Judowgi and Eunjoo. On Delta, the Captain reveals his true identity to the Chief before attempting to impale him with a robotic arm, before Gokdari and Rockpile appear in time. Cacuruse transforms into his monstrous form and a fight ensues between the three with Rockpile destroying Cacuruse's teeth and Gokdari making him dizzy. The fight ends with the two torturing Cacuruse into submission with his only weakness (ants), before capturing him with Gokdari's staff. Back on X7, Big Boy and Samachi rescue Eunjoo from Judowgi's cave, waking Judowgi from his sleep. Big Boy and Samachi attempt to take on the monster but are beaten and captured by Judowgi's vine tendrils. Before Judowgi can finish them off, Gokdari arrives in time with the rest of the Super Kids and join the two. The four battle Judowgi in a high-speed chase across the planet, before the beast transforms into a tree-like humanoid monster, captures the Super Kids and destroys Gokdari's staff. Maio reappears, and announces he is tired of all his service to Judowgi, and wants to help the Super Kids because Gokdari resembles his long-deceased son. The Super Kids watch as Maio and Judowgi battle, which culminates in Maio extracting a red orb from Judowgi's body, supposedly rendering him powerless. Maio destroys the orb, killing himself in the process and causing Gokdari's staff to magically re-materialise for no explained reason. Judowgi attacks the Super Kids once again (despite his power orb being destroyed), before Gokdari grows into a giant and the team beat the monster into submission, finally being captured by Gokdari's staff. The Super Kids leave X7, with Eunjoo having recorded the battle in time for the next news broadcast and return to Earth. Back at the Super Kids' headquarters, the accountant has misplaced all the reward money the Super Kids had earned from their recent adventures, only to discover Gokdari had donated it to an orphanage.

Throughout the 1970s, South Korea's own animation industry began to flourish, which borrowed heavily from the Japanese anime style. Many Korean animated films also integrated unauthorized usages of Japanese anime characters and likenesses. With the super robot genre developing in Japan in the 1970s with Mazinger Z, Robot Taekwon V borrowed heavily from the titular mecha's likeness. In the late 1980s with the relaxation of government censorship in cinema and South Korean films achieving international audiences for the first time, the South Korean animation industry intended to gain a major foothold in the market alongside the United States and Japan. Production began on Super Kid in 1991, and was produced with the intent for worldwide distribution and eventual franchise expansion.https://web.archive.org/web/20100617172115/http://www.umlee.com/ani- characters-e.htm The ban on Japanese anime and manga was lifted incrementally from 1998 to 2004.  Release  Super Kid was released in South Korean theatres in July 23, 1994.http://www.animated- divots.net/chrn1994.htmlhttps://www.anisearch.de/anime/2965,super-kid The English dub was by the Ocean Group, and was released in 1995. A 52-episode animated series developed by Alex Massis and Rosie & Lee Studios was to follow the movie, but was soon abandoned. https://variety.com/1997/film/news/support- org-changes-with-times-adds-tv-component-1116676630/ The movie was released on VHS and as of 2017, no DVD or Blu-Ray release of Super Kid has been released. = Criticism = Super Kid fell into obscurity for years after its video release, but the movie has gained notoriety since the movie surfaced on YouTube. It has been criticized as a rip-off of Dragon Ball, with main character Gokdari resembling young Goku, Eunjoo resembling Bulma, and Samachi resembling Piccolo. The mecha ship the Super Kids travel in closely resembles the titular ship from Mazinger Z. Criticism has also been aimed at the contradictory and mean-spirited nature of the main characters. In a scene introducing the main characters, Gokdari's sense of chivalry is noted, but he is shown to be expecting rewards whenever he delivers criminals to the authorities. In a scene where the Super Kids discover a villain's weakness is an ant, Gokdari mercilessly bullies the villain with the offending insect.

It was released worldwide for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Windows, and PCs running Linux on 7 December 2016. The game is set after the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the queen's use of the royal prerogative to take control over the country herself and the subsequent set up of a space organisation called SPIFFING. The plot follows Captain Frank Lee English and his Welsh subordinate Aled Jones in their attempts to establish a galactic British Empire. Gameplay The game features many elements from point-and-click adventure games. In this screenshot, English, the player-character, is making a cup of tea. Her Majesty's SPIFFING is point-and-click-style adventure game. Plot The game is set shortly after the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Dismayed by its political turmoil and isolation, the queen invokes the royal prerogative to dissolve parliament and take control over the county herself in an attempt to make Britain great again. Recognising the difficulties in re- conquering a quarter of the Earth's surface, the queen creates a new space organisation called SPIFFING (Special Planetary Investigative Force For Inhabiting New Galaxies) with the intention of establishing a galactic British Empire. After preparations made in Hounslow Mission Control, Big Ben is launched into space and a fleet of colonists set course for planets in the Milky Way. On board the HMSS Imperialise (a converted Mini Cooper), Captain Frank Lee English, along with his Welsh subordinate Sub-lieutenant Aled Jones, lead the colonisation effort. English is a middle class, well mannered man with militaristic experience whereas Jones is wryly incompetent. After finding a barren planet fit for colonisation, the two land on it only to discover that it has been claimed by the French. After exploring the planet further, English and Jones discover two French colonists; the first man, Antoine, is a short Napoleon lookalike whereas the other is a gorilla named Pierre. Antoine explains that he intends to terraform the planet and plant masses of vineyards so that he could produce fine wine, with his ultimate goal of ensuring that the people of his empire will eat cr√™pes, wear berets and ride bicycles. English decides that he must remove the presence of the French along with their flag before he can legitimately claim the world. To accomplish this, he throws a frog and cheddar cheese at the French colonists, with both deciding to retreat to their Concorde. After replacing the Tricolore with the Union Jack, the French concede defeat shortly before their Concorde explodes due to a fire. As English and Jones run for cover, a platoon of American soldiers arrive on the planet. Seeing that the world has already been claimed, they decide to leave, disliking the British weather. Development The game was developed by Belfast-based Billy Goat Entertainment Ltd, a studio formerly specialising in animated advertisements for Irish television. According to William Barr‚Äîdirector and designer of Her Majesty's SPIFFING‚Äîthe game was originally set to be a short animated film, however Barr realised that a film would be more difficult to fund than an adventure game. Barr also reflected that the studio had some experience with outsource game development for other studios, and cited 1990s LucasArts point-and-click video games as a major inspiration. Since the game was to be the studio's debut title, a Kickstarter proposal was submitted in hopes that the game would receive adequate funding, but \\"failed awfully\\" according to Barr. The proposal ended shy of ¬£12,000, raised from a total of 338 backers. The studio recognised the difficulties in creating a new video game as Barr reflected that his studio was an obscure indie game developer and did not have a back catalogue. Despite this, a second Kickstarter proposal was submitted in November 2014 to greater success. The studio had asked for ¬£30,000 in funds and also received finance from Northern Ireland Screen, as well as benefiting from UK video game tax breaks. Furthermore, the team had to use work for hire and a substantial overdraft. Due to the outcome of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the game had to be rewritten and some jokes adjusted in order for some parts to make sense. For example, a self destruct button in the player-character's spaceship has an Article 50 sticker imprinted on it, and the game also contains some references to Nigel Farage. Barr thought that the game could benefit from these references and the outcome of Brexit and even hoped that it would be marked as the \\"Official Brexit Game\\", but was concerned that a European audience would find its tone arrogant. In light of this, the team had to make some adjustments while trying to keep game's satirical tone. As a result of this, a late addition to the game was to add in the option of using either an English voice or an American voice. If American dialogue is chosen, a laugh track is played after an appropriate joke so that its audience would be able to understand whenever a joke is happening. The team wanted to ensure that the player would have a closer connection with the protagonist as opposed to feeling of \\"disconnect\\" between the two in typical point-and-click adventure games. Barr compared the feeling of disorganisation with games like The Sims and The Curse of Monkey Island, where he opined that the player always had to suggest an action as opposed to physically participating themselves. To counteract this, the team tried to alleviate the sense of disconnect by giving the player direct control of the protagonist, resembling that of an ordinary third-person adventure game. Barr took further comparison to traditional point-and-click titles which involved mundane gameplay tasks, and stressed that he wanted to make Her Majesty's SPIFFING more responsive and immersive. Barr also explained that keeping the Captain English on-screen at all times instead of viewing it through his point of view would allow them to design a more personable and endearing character, as well as helping the player bond with English. Reception Her Majesty's SPIFFING received mixed reviews upon release. The Xbox One version holds an average score of 66% at Metacritic, based on an aggregate of eight reviews, the PC version a score of 60% based on five reviews, the PlayStation 4 version a score of 74%, based on four reviews, and the Nintendo Switch version a score of 68%, based on four reviews.

It has over 1.3 million solar panels, generating 102 megawatts of power. It was opened on 18 April 2015, and became fully operational in July 2015. The Nyngan Solar Plant is associated with the Broken Hill Solar Plant, a 53 megawatt farm located almost 600 km west, which became operational in December 2015,, making the total capacity of the combined plants 155 megawatts. The solar panels do not track the movement of the sun. They are arranged in rows facing north, tilted at 25 degrees. Financial impact The plants were constructed with $166.7 million funding support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and $64.9 million from the NSW Government. There was some criticism of the use of Government funding. Both plants were constructed by AGL in partnership with First Solar, Bogan Shire Council (Nyngan) and Broken Hill City Council, and local communities. The total cost of the projects was $440 million.

It has a single dull green leaf with purple blotches near the base, and a single cream-coloured to pink flower with red to maroon markings. It is only known from a single population containing fewer than ten plants. Description Caladenia armata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows in small groups. It has a single dull green leaf with purple blotches near the base. The leaf is long, wide and is densely covered with hairs up to long. A single flower wide is borne on a wiry, hairy, reddish flowering stem tall. The flower is cream- coloured to pink, with red lines. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and tapers to a thick glandular tip long. The lateral sepals are a similar to the dorsal sepal but almost twice as wide. The petals are long and wide. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide and dark red to maroon or green with a maroon tip. The labellum curves forward and there are five to twelve pairs of linear, dark purplish-red teeth on its sides. The mid-line of the labellum has four rows of calli, the longest of which are and shaped like hockey sticks. Flowering occurs in October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia armata was first formally described in 2006 by David L. Jones who gave it the name Arachnorchis armata and published the description in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected on the Majura Field Firing Range. In 2010, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia armata. The specific epithet (armata) is a Latin word meaning \\"furnish[ed] with weapons\\", referring to the type location. Distribution and habitat This spider orchid is only known from ten individual plants growing in the Majura Field Firing Range in open forest of red stringbark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha) and white gum (Eucalyptus rossii.

In the book Baudet follows Roger Scruton's criticism on cultural relativism and multiculturalism. Baudets comes up with the word Oikophobia and explains this as a term that stands for a type of self hate of the (left) elite towards their own traditional culture. According to Baudet this becomes visible in the society in the dominant preference for open borders within Europe, modern art, multiculturalism. The book forms, together with Baudets other book Aanval op de natiestaat, the fundament for his political program of his political party Forum voor Democratie. Reviews about the book have appeared in De Groene Amsterdammer, Joop (VARA), Vlaams Belang, Trouw, Vrij Nederland, Nederlandse Publieke Omroep Kunststof, Propria Cures, De Dagelijkse Standaard. Criticism Several thinkers have strongly criticized Baudets thinking. Sociologist Jan Willem Duyvendak claims the exact opposite in fact regarding the political elite who is focused Dutch people on 'feeling at home', which was part of the Amsterdam political plans. The opening of the Nationaal Historisch Museum and the integration policies for immigrants are focused on adapting to the Dutch identity instead of assimilation of both immigrants as well as Dutch people. Duyvendak speaks of oikophily or oikomania instead. According to cultural philosopher Thijs Lijster, Baudet is making a fallacy by mixing the public space, the city and the house as one thing. The rules inside the house differ from the ones in the city and the public space. This results in the distinction to regard certain groups of people as 'guests' instead of legal civilians. Musicologist Yuri Landman explains Baudet creates a paradox by stating modern art (and atonal music) are inferior in quality compared to pre-1900 art and music, while he also states that the Western culture is superior above any other culture and should be protected to what Baudet has called 'the homeopathic dilution of our culture' by immigrants with a different cultural background. If everything after 1900 is inferior, the contemporary Western culture can not be superior. Also Landman warns Baudet for approaching the concept of degenerate art with his conservative criticism.

By expressing a preference for none of the above, a citizen can choose not to vote for any candidates who are contesting the elections. The vote does not hold any electoral value: even if a majority of votes are cast for NOTA, the candidate with the largest vote share would be declared the winner.{{cite weburl=https://www.theelectionhub.com/featured/nota-the-rejection-or-just-a- negative-opinion/title=NOTA- The rejection or Just a negative opinion? - The Election Hubdate=24 February 201 The NOTA option was first used in the 2013 assembly elections held in four states (Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh), and the Union Territory of Delhi. Since its introduction, NOTA has gained increasing popularity amongst the Indian electorate, securing more votes than the victory margin, for instance, in the Assembly Elections in Gujarat 2017, Karnataka (2018), Madhya Pradesh (2018) and Rajasthan (2018). NOTA enables the voter to show their inacceptance for the fielded candidates. Supreme Court Judgement on NOTA A writ petition was filed by People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). The Supreme Court of India judgement said, \\"We direct the Election Commission to provide necessary provision in the ballot papers/EVMs and another button called ‚ÄúNone of the Above‚Äù (NOTA) may be provided in EVMs so that the voters, who come to the polling booth and decide not to vote for any of the candidates in the fray, are able to exercise their right not to vote while maintaining their right of secrecy.\\" The Supreme Court also observed that it is essential that people of high moral and ethical values are chosen as people's representatives for proper governance of the country, and NOTA button can compel political parties to nominate a sound candidate. Election Commission of India (ECI) and NOTA #ECI has stated that \\"...even if, in any extreme case, the number of votes against NOTA is more than the number of votes secured by the candidates, the candidate who secures the largest number of votes among the contesting candidates shall be declared to be elected...\\" #In a clarification released in 2013, ECI has stated that votes polled for NOTA cannot be considered for determining the forfeiture of security deposit. #In 2014, ECI introduced NOTA in Rajya Sabha elections. #In 2015, Election Commission of India announced the symbol for 'None of the Above' option, with the design being done by National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad. Earlier, there were demands that Election Commission allot the symbol of a donkey for NOTA. Performance In many elections, NOTA has won more votes than many of the political parties that contested. In many constituencies, votes received by NOTA have been higher than the margin by which the candidate has won. Observations have been made that NOTA can influence more citizens to participate in voting, though there is a danger that the novelty factor associated with NOTA will gradually erode. A pie chart depicting the scenario where (top) the number of votes polled for the None of the Above (NOTA) option are greater than the Victory Margin in an election where NOTA has no electoral value versus (bottom) two scenarios where the NOTA voters would have chosen one of the winning parties, leading to two different outcomes. However, it seems that the popularity of NOTA is growing with time. NOTA has not yet managed to secure a majority so far, but in many of the elections since its introduction - including the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections as well as several Assembly Elections - the number of NOTA votes polled has been higher than the victory margin in many constituencies. This means that if instead of NOTA, the voters would have opted to go with one of the two top-scoring parties, it could have changed the outcome of the election, as depicted in the pie chart. In the 2017 Gujarat Assembly Elections, the total vote share of NOTA was lesser only than BJP, Congress, and Independent Candidates. In 118 constituencies, NOTA polled the third largest vote share after BJP and Congress. In the 2018 Karnataka Assembly Elections, NOTA polled more votes than some parties with a nation-wide presence such as CPI(M) and BSP. In the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections conducted in 2018, the difference between the vote share of the (winning) BJP and Congress was just 0.1%, whereas NOTA polled a vote share of 1.4%. To cite an example, in the South Gwalior Constituency, the sitting MLA Narayan Singh Kushwah lost by 121 votes, whereas NOTA got 1550 votes. Had all the NOTA voters hypothetically voted for Kushwah, he would have won by a huge margin. In the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, 2G scam accused MP - A Raja (DMK candidate) - lost to the AIADMK candidate, while NOTA emerged with the third largest vote share, possibly as an expression of public anger towards corrupt candidates. In the 2019 Indian general election, about 1.04 percent of the voters chose to vote for None Of The Above (NOTA), with Bihar and Assam leading with 2.08 percent NOTA voters. Responses NOTA has been described as the maturing of India's democracy. One kind of opinion is that the purpose and advantage of NOTA has been defeated as the winner will be the candidate who receives the second highest number of votes, even if NOTA receives the highest number of votes. Hence, \\"NOTA is a positive step\\", while \\"it does not go far enough\\". NOTA is considered a \\"waste of vote\\", \\"merely cosmetic\\", \\"a symbolic instrument to express resentment\\", voters expressing their \\"disenchantment with the existing political system\\" and possibly \\"a mere decoration\\". However, the power of NOTA to express dissent is clearly visible in reports where entire communities decided to democratically protest against governments that have failed to meet their needs. For instance, there have been multiple cases of entire villages deciding to vote for NOTA due to consistent failure of local governments to meet basic requirements like roads, electricity, inaction towards villagers' complaints about water contamination by industries, and even reports of sex workers who have been pushing for legalisation of their profession to get themselves covered under labour laws, but have received no government attention, deciding to go for NOTA. What is unclear is whether so far this protest has translated into compensatory action by the elected Government. However, while passing the NOTA ruling, the Chief Justice of India, P. Sathasivam, was quoted as stating ‚ÄúGiving right to a voter not to vote for any candidate while protecting his right of secrecy is extremely important in a democracy. Such an option gives the voter the right to express his disapproval of the kind of candidates being put up by the parties. Gradually, there will be a systemic change and the parties will be forced to accept the will of the people and field candidates who are known for their integrity.‚Äù. A number of groups and individuals have been conducting voter awareness campaigns about NOTA. Recent year election results have shown an increasing trend of people choosing NOTA. It has been observed that some of the highest NOTA votes polled are consistently seen in Reserved Constituencies (Constituencies that, based on their demographic composition, are required to field only candidates from Reserved Categories to contest elections). This could be interpreted as a refusal of general category voters to vote for an SC/ST candidate \\\\- a scenario where NOTA is being misused to uphold caste- based bias. While on the one hand, more votes for NOTA could be interpreted as more expression of the prevailing dissatisfaction in the electorate, there is also the danger that the underlying cause is ignorance about the candidates, uninformed and irresponsible voting, or expression of bias on the basis of caste, as seen in the case of Reserved Constituencies. Thus, while NOTA is definitely providing a voice to dissent, it needs to be accompanied with efforts to raise voter awareness to prevent the misuse of this measure. Suggested Improvements There have been discussions to improve on NOTA, and to empower the voter through NOTA. Some of those suggested improvements include: #If NOTA receives the highest number of votes, re-election should be held in that constituency with new and freshers candidate or that constituency should be ruled by the Governor. #If NOTA receives the highest number of votes, re-elections should be held in that constituency #When conducting re- elections, the NOTA button may be disabled to avoid a series of re-elections #Political parties that lose to NOTA to bear the cost of re-election #The candidates who lose to NOTA should not be allowed to contest elections for a defined period of time (for example, 6 years) #Candidates receiving votes less than NOTA to be disqualified to contest any election in future, even in constituencies where NOTA might not have got maximum votes #To conduct re- election, if the votes polled for NOTA is higher than the winning margin of votes. There have been PILs filed to 'strengthen' the impact of NOTA in 2016 and 2017 by providing it the Power to Reject - asking for re-elections if NOTA wins majority, and barring the rejected candidates from contesting. However, the Supreme Court responded to these PILs by stating that such a solution is 'unworkable' and stating that \\"holding an election in our country is a very serious and expensive business\\". But voicing another line of opinion, Sanjay Parikh, a Supreme Court advocate who argued for PUCL in favour of NOTA, had stated in a 2013 interview: \\"Some people argue that the implementation of NOTA will drive up election expenses. But a tainted candidate who indulges in corruption and malpractices is a greater cost for the country. It is only the desire to continue in power and the greed for money that take prominence over values.\\" NOTA in local elections NOTA was not included in the 2015 Kerala panchayat elections. Section 79 (d) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, recognises \\"electoral right\\" to also include the right to \\"refrain from voting at an election\\". 'The Representation of People Act' is applicable to \\"...either House of Parliament or in the House or either House of the Legislature of a State...\\" Recognition of \\"electoral right\\" as also the right to \\"refrain from voting at an election\\" is not made in the acts pertaining to elections to panchayats in Kerala. Including NOTA in panchayat elections to these states and making improvements to NOTA may require changes or amendments to these acts and rules. In 2018, the State Election Commission (SEC) of Maharashtra studied local body elections over the previous two years, and found several cases where NOTA had won more votes than the winning candidates. To cite some examples: In the Bori gram panchayat polls in the Pune district, NOTA polled 85.57% votes; in the Mankarwadi gram panchayat polls in same district, 204 of a total 330 valid votes went to NOTA. The sarpanch of Khugaon Khurd in Nanded district got just 120 votes while NOTA had got 627 of the total 849 votes. Similarly, in a local election in the Khavadi village in Lanja tehsil, the winning candidate got 130 votes of 441 valid votes, while NOTA polled 210 votes. Considering this, the Maharashtra SEC decided to consider amending the existing laws on NOTA. In November 2018, the SEC announced that if NOTA gets the maximum votes in an election, re-elections would be held. The order would be applicable to polls and by-polls to all municipal corporations, municipal councils and nagar panchayats with immediate effect. If NOTA gets the highest number of votes in the re-election as well, the candidate with the most votes, excluding NOTA, will be declared the winner. However, the rejected candidates are not barred from re-elections. The Haryana SEC followed suit too, declaring in November 2018 that NOTA would be treated as a fictional candidate and re-elections would be conducted if NOTA won the majority vote in the upcoming Municipal Elections in December 2018.

Nalagamaraju was supported by Nayakuralu Nagamma while Malidevaraju was supported by Recherla Brahmanaidu, a social reformer. Background Palnadu is a region located in the south-western area of Guntur district and covering some part of Prakasam district. It is spread over the present-day areas of Narasaraopet and Gurazala in the Guntur district and Markapur in the Prakasam district of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. When Anuguraju of the Haihayas migrated to the Andhra area from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, he clashed with the Velanati Chodas of Velanadu who ruled from Chandavolu. Velanati Gonkaraju installed Anuguraju as king of Palnadu at Gurajala after giving his daughter Mailama Devi to him in marriage. As Anuguraju was non-Telugu-speaking and had migrated to Andhra area only at that time, and unfamiliar with the local people, Gonkaraju appointed Dodda Naidu of Recherla Gotra as his minister to guide him. Anugu Raju had 2 more wives, Viravidya Devi and Bhoorama Devi. Anuguraju was however childless and adopted the eldest son of his minister Dodda Naidu. Soon after this Mailama Devi gave birth to a son called Nalagamaraju. Disillusioned with the turn of events Dodda Naidu stepped down as minister of Anuguraju and made his younger son Brahma Naidu as a minister instead. Nalagamaraju became king after Anuguraju. Nalagamaraju had a step brother called Malidevaraju who married a princess from the Kalachuris of Kalyanadurga in Karnataka. Brahma Naidu was highly respected in his time and was a warrior, scholar and reformer. Brahmanaidu captured the fort of Shimoga from the Veera Saivaites on the request of the Kalyani Chalukyan King of Kalyani. The king in turn gave his daughter Sirimadevi in marriage to Malidevaraju. Brahma Naidu was a staunch Vaishnavaite and founded a new sect called Veera Vaishnavism as against Veera Saivism which was prevalent then and which allowed the Sudras into its fold but not untouchables. Brahma Naidu allowed equal status to the untouchables. The social reforms like Chapa Koodu (having food sitting side by side on a mat irrespective of class) initiated by Brahma Naidu antagonized the orthodox people of the Palnadu society. Brahma Naidu did not stop with Chapakoodu and in this he was centuries, ahead of the present day social reformers. He had all people including the untouchables in his army. In fact Kannamanedu from the untouchables was treated almost like Brahma Naidu's own son and was made the commander of his army. The orthodox people found an able leader in one lady named Nagamma who was known as Nayakuralu. Nagamma joined the court of Nalagamaraju and gained his confidence. Thereafter, she made Nalagamarju displace Brahma Naidu's men from key positions. The differences in the court and the royal family grew which led to the division of the Kingdom. Nalagamaraju‚Äôs half brother Malidevarju moved to Macherla and set up a separate kingdom there. Brahma Naidu moved to Macherla along with Malidevaraju. Mutual suspicion between the two kingdoms grew and Nagamma under the pretext of Malideva's defeat in a cockfight exiled them for 7 years from Palnadu. After the exile Brahma Naidu sent Alaraju the brother in law of Malidevaraju to claim Malidevaraju‚Äôs share. The demand was turned down and Alaraju was poisoned in Cherlagudipadu by the orders of Nagamma. His wife Perindevi committed Sati with Alaraju. This enraged Malidevaraju and Kommaraju who was the father of Alaraju. Brahma Naidu then declared war on Gurajala.  Battle  The battle was fought at Karempudi on the banks of the river. Nalagamaraju was supported by the Kakatiyas, Hoysalas and Paricchedis. Malidevaraju was supported by the Kalachuris of Kalyanadurga. Nalagamaraju's side was victorious in the battle and Malidevaraju died during the battle. Brahma Naidu was forced to reinstate Nalagamaraju. Balachandrudu the valiant son of Brahma Naidu died in this battle along with his wife Manchala. A whole generation of Andhra warriors perished in the battle. This battle weakened the Velnati Chodas, and this later helped the Kakatiyas to take over their domain.

History & Description Although only a small station, Glyntaff was, at the time of opening, the location of the line's engine shed. This closed in September 1922. It was also the site of the railmotor shed, which was opened in 1906 and closed in 1930, though the siding remained until 1947. One of the sidings served Pentrebach Quarry, under an agreement of 1903. The quarry changed hands in 1925 and the agreement was terminated.Hutton, J. The Newport Docks & Railway Company. Silver Link. 1996. p.85 The station initially had ground-level platforms, but these were soon modified to raised ones. It is possible that this was done in 1906, when similar alterations were carried out at Pontypridd Tram Road Halt. The station had a single long building. In 1924, the station was renamed Glyntaff Halt by the Great Western Railway, which had taken over the line during the Grouping. Glyntaff Halt closed some years before the other stations on the line, ceasing to operate in 1930.

Despite periodic suppression by the Hungarian Communist regime, by the early 1980s Hung√°ria was one of the country's most popular bands.  History  Mikl√≥s Feny≈ë had lived in the United States for a time. He entered the Hungarian music scene in 1962 and started his own band Syconor in 1964. In 1967 he formed a songwriting partnership with lyricist Istv√°n S. Nagy, and formed Hung√°ria as an outlet for his songs. The earliest Hung√°ria songs were in the style of beat music. In 1968 the band won the televised talent competition Ki mit tud?. In the following years, the band moved toward psychedelic rock and hard rock. Their first album Koncert a marson (Concert on Mars) was released in 1970. The band then experienced many lineup changes, with Feny≈ë as the only consistent member. Due to pressure from Hungary's Communist regime, which considered rock music to be subversive, Hung√°ria faced many difficulties in the mid-1970s. They were unable to sell records or perform live in their own country. For several years they were only able to perform live in East Germany, and later they were able to make a living by touring other countries in the Soviet bloc. They recorded a Beatles covers album titled Beatles Laz, which was released in other countries in 1978 but was outlawed in Hungary until 1997. In 1979 the band decided to adopt the style of early rock n' roll revivals, with English lyrics and tours of Western Europe.Priv√°t Rockt√∂rt√©net / 25. r√©sz, A Hung√°ria; dokumentumfilm sorozat, 2009, operat≈ër: V√°rkonyi S√°ndor, szerkesztette: Gell√©rt G√°bor Their 1980 album in this style, Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô Roll Party, was a major hit in Hungary, and the band adopted 1950s American rock n' roll fashions for all public appearances, as did many of their fans. The 1981 album Hotel Menthol was another substantial hit.Feny≈ë Mikl√≥s Experidance.jegy.hu In 1982 the band played to 150,000 people at N√©pstadion in Budapest. Some members of the band resisted the focus on 1950s music and imagery, as Feny≈ë tried to enforce a fashion code even for the members' personal lives. This caused the band to split in 1983. Several compilations and live albums were released in the following years. After the breakup, Feny≈ë released a successful solo album titled Miki and briefly led a new band called Modern Hung√°ria. Several notable members of the original Hung√°ria reunited in 1995 for the album √âbredj fel Rockandrollia (Awaken Rock n' Roll). A musical based on the band's music, titled Hotel Menthol, debuted in 1998 and was performed more than 200 times.

It is a reboot of the 1968-70 Hanna-Barbera animated series of the same name. The show debuted in 2017 on Boomerang's video on demand service in the United States. Wacky Races was picked up for a second season.  Summary  The series features the return of characters from the original Wacky Races program, including Dick Dastardly, Muttley, Penelope Pitstop, Peter Perfect and the Gruesome Twosome. Several new characters were introduced as well, including I. Q. Ickly, Brick Crashman, P. T. Barnstorm, and Pandora Pitstop. While the reboot stays true to the original series, it also focuses on the Racers' personal lives; storylines are added and there usually is no actual winner or loser at the end of each race. There is also meta-humor and fourth wall breaking.  Characters  = Main = * Dick Dastardly III and Muttley (voiced by Peter Woodward and Billy West): In this modern series, Dick Dastardly is still up to his usual trickery and cheating activities, though is now often badgered into either being nice or not cheating by Peter Perfect. Unlike before, his appearance is predominantly purple in color instead of blue, red and purple. Muttley, however, has undergone virtually no changes aside from his outward appearance, still either snickering or grumbling. In \\"Mother Knows Best\\", it is revealed that Dick Dastardly is actually the son/descendant of the original Dick Dastardly from the original Wacky Races series, who is also the husband of Delilah Dastardly. However, in \\"Grandfather Knows Dast\\", his grandfather is actually revealed to be the original Dick Dastardly from the original Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines series. * Penelope Pitstop (voiced by Nicole Parker): Another original character, Penelope Pitstop has undergone the most changes from the original, both in appearance and outlook. While more assertive and much less of a damsel in distress than the original, she is still often the goody-two-shoes of the group, and still talks like a Southern belle. Like before, her appearance is predominantly pink with hearts. * Peter Perfect (voiced by Diedrich Bader): Like Dastardly and Muttley, largely unchanged from the original, although he is a bit more taunting of Dastardly than before. His appearance is predominantly orange and red. * Tiny and Bella ‚Äì the Gruesome Twosome (voiced by Billy West and Tom Kenny): They round out the characters from the original series, and are the closest to their original versions in most every respect. * Ignatius Quinton \\"I. Q.\\" Ickly (voiced by Jill Talley): A new character who is often called a \\"walking encyclopedia\\" by Dastardly, and has little social capability. His appearance is largely similar to that of Peter Perfect, except for his use of yellow or gold and his being around the size of Bella. = Secondary =  Racers  * Pandora Pitstop (voiced by Nicole Parker): A new character. Penelope's evil (and 12 seconds younger) twin sister and frequent guest Racer. She is similar to Penelope except her outfit is predominantly purple and is often meaner and more underhanded than even Dastardly is. She often allies with Dastardly, but usually to her ends. * Captain Dash, Polly, Bugsy, Bluebeard and Davey Bones (voiced by Billy West and Tom Kenny): A gang of pirates that often steal gigs from Dastardly.  Non-Racers  * Brick Crashman (voiced by Christopher Judge): The announcer for the Wacky Races. * P. T. Barnstorm (voiced by Jill Talley): The owner and sponsor for the Wacky Races.  Guest Stars  * Huckleberry Hound (voiced by Billy West): a guest racer and Peter Perfect‚Äôs stunt double * Snagglepuss (voiced by Billy West and Tom Kenny) * Hong Kong Phooey (voiced by Phil LaMarr) * Quick Draw McGraw (voiced by Billy West) * Touch√© Turtle (voiced by Billy West): a guest racer * Ricochet Rabbit (voiced by Tom Kenny): a guest racer  Episodes   Broadcast  Wacky Races has premiered internationally in 2017.

Long Lake is an manmade lake in Union County, South Carolina. It is used for fishing, with largemouth bass, bluegill, shellcracker (redear sunfish), and catfish in the lake. There is a boat ramp and a fishing pier. Location and geography The lake is located about west of Lockhart, the nearest town, and about northeast of Union, the nearest city. It lies about two miles north of the northern boundary of Sumter National Forest, and the shores are mostly wooded, with poplars, black gum trees, and loblolly pines prevailing; cedar trees were planted in the 2010s. Hughes Creek both feeds and drains the lake, running south into it and southwards out of it to the Broad River. The elevation is , and the depth exceeds . South Carolina Highway 49 (which runs between Union and Lockhart) passes just south of the lake. South Carolina Highway 105 originates at an intersection with Highway 49 directly southeast of the lake and runs north, and South Carolina Highway 9 passes about north of the lake. Access to the western end of the lake, where the fishing pier and boat ramp is located, is via Black Bottom Road which connects to Highway 9. Access to the eastern end is from John D. Long Lake Road which connects to Highway 49. This gives out on a small parkland near the dam, where the boat ramp was formerly located. History The lake was created in the 1970s on the initiative of South Carolina state senator John David Long III and named for his father, John David Long, also a South Carolina state senator, and Ku Klux Klan and Confederate flag champion. An earthen dam was built at a pasture on Hughes Creek to fill it. Nine people have died at the lake's old boat ramp, which had been located near the dam at the eastern end. In 1994, Susan Smith drowned her two sons there, in a case which attracted national attention. Granite memorials were raised to the boys, and many visitors came. In 1996 seven people died when their car rolled down the boat ramp into the lake, after which the memorials were moved and the boat ramp dug up and grassed over. On July 1, 2013, the lake was closed for two years for renovation and restoration by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The balance between the bream and largemouth bass populations had become upset and the lake had become overcrowded with bass. The state stunned and relocated the bass, drained the lake, cut and planted trees, and laid down of gravel to create spawning grounds for bluegill and shellcracker (redear sunfish). The lake was refilled, and reopened for fishing on July 1, 2015; catfish were introduced later. References Lakes of South Carolina Bodies of water of Union County, South Carolina ","title":"John D.

It was built in 1880‚Äì81 in the Victorian architectural style by Ferdinand Reuss Snr. Significant alterations which changed the facade to an Inter-War Free Classical style were completed in 1928 by architects D. T. Morrow and Gordon. The Town Hall was the seat of Alexandria Municipal Council from 1881 to 1948 and since 1948 has been a branch library, community centre and council depot for the City of Sydney and the South Sydney councils. History and description Alexandria Town Hall, pictured in \\"Alexandria, 'the Birmingham of Australia'\\", 1943. The site of the Town Hall was acquired by the council in Garden Street in 1879 and Ferdinand Reuss Snr was commissioned as the architect. The Town Hall was completed and opened in June 1881 by the Mayor, Charles Brandling Henderson. By 1893 a two storey terrace, serving as a residence for the mayor, was constructed to the north of the Town Hall. =Later history= Following the amalgamation of the Alexandria municipality into the City of Sydney in 1948, the town hall ceased being a council seat and discussion occurred over its future use. The hall was considered for use as a branch of the City of Sydney Library (nearby Waterloo Town Hall was also later chosen) and on 16 February 1951, Sydney Lord Mayor Ernest Charles O'Dea opened the Alexandria Branch Library, with the hall venue, a limited number of council offices and the rear depot retained. From 1968‚Äì1982 and 1989‚Äì2004, the hall came under the control of the Northcott/South Sydney Municipal Council and the City of South Sydney, and housed the offices of the Municipal Engineer's Department. The hall continued its use as a branch library until 1990 and in 1994‚Äì1997 the hall was also home to The Women's Library. =Heritage listing and conservation= The Town Hall, along with the \\"mayor's house\\" next door, is listed under the 2012 Sydney Local Environment Plan as \\"a representative example of a Victorian Town Hall modified with an Inter-War Free Classical style fa√ßade. It is representative of the work of two relatively prominent architectural practices of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries although that of the DT Morrow and Gordon practice predominate. It has important historical associations with the local community and local government in the area and serves as a representative indicator of the small inner-city Council areas which were subsumed into larger municipalities after World War II.\\" In March 2017, the Sydney City Council commissioned extensive restoration and conservation works to the hall, with Lord Mayor Clover Moore noting that \\"Alexandria Town Hall is an important civic building, we have a responsibility to make sure it meets the future needs of the community\\". The works, which included restoring the building's exterior and interior, were completed by the council in November 2017.

It is a very early example of a work including hand-coloured aquatints. The thirty-six animals described, all mammals except for the crocodile, were from both the New World and the Old World. At the time Catton had not travelled abroad so he drew native British animals as well as exotics kept in captivity in Britain. Catton's \\"The Maucauco\\" (ring-tailed lemur) Background Catton was by profession an artist who was taught his skills by his father, also called Charles Catton, who is known in the history of art as Charles Catton the elder. =Charles Catton the elder= The elder Catton (1728‚Äì1798) was apprenticed to a coach builder at a time when it was fashionable to have heraldic coats of arms painted on the sides of the coaches. He became skilled in the artistic part of his trade and was well known for his ability at painting animals supporting coats of arms in a naturalistic way rather than heraldically. As well as becoming coach painter to George III he became an accomplished portraitist and a founder member of the Royal Academy. =Charles Catton the younger's art= Charles Catton the younger (1756‚Äì1819) was apprenticed to his father, working closely to his style, and was trained at the Royal Academy schools. He exhibited regularly at the Academy (1775‚Äì1800) ‚Äì landscapes, animals and topographical watercolours ‚Äì and was an occasional scene painter at Covent Garden Theatre (1781‚Äì1794). He toured Great Britain making paintings and sketches, many of which were later engraved by others but he was a skilled engraver himself. He did not leave Britain until he emigrated to the United States in 1804. Shortly after \\"Animals\\" was published he contributed some illustrations for John White's 1790 Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales. Publication thumb Animals was first published in 1788 in London by I. and J. Taylor and then again in 1825 in New Haven by H. Howe, a local bookseller and publisher. Thirty-six animals are described, each having a whole-page illustration and a page of text ‚Äì 74 pages in all. The first edition is upright folio (2¬∞), and the prints are . The text and most of the illustrations are orientated sideways so the pages are in landscape format. The binding is calfskin with gilt embellishments and the spine is in seven panels with a morocco leather title label in the second panel. The endpapers are with spot and veined marbling. The √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna has placed page images of its first edition online. The book is also hosted on the Internet Archive. and a proofread text version is on Wikisource at Animals drawn from Nature and engraved in aqua-tinta. In the first edition the aquatints are coloured and, according to Sarah Prideaux (1909) The \\"thick yellow varnish\\" referred to by Prideaux is very evident in the scan available. An example of the American 1825 edition is described as having its images uncoloured. When describing prints, \\"hand-coloured\\" means that a monochrome print has been painted afterwards. This is to be distinguished from \\"colour-printed\\" which means that the printing itself was in colour. Colour printing could be produced either by painting the plate carefully with differently coloured inks and then making a single pressing, or by making a number of plates, engraved appropriately for each colour, and making sequential impressions. These techniques may be combined together in a single illustration. An example of the British 1788 edition of Animals is described as having \\"hand-coloured aquatint plates by and after Catton, heightened with white and gum arabic.\\" meaning that the illustrations were coloured afterwards and the reference to gum arabic further suggests that this what is meant. According to Baynton-Williams (1990) Reception In 1791 the book was on sale for ¬£3 17s 0d () and ¬£9 5s 0d (¬£) if the plates were coloured, but by 1831 the inclusive price was only ¬£3 13s 6d (¬£) with the recommendation \\"Catton was an eminent coach-painter and a very superior draftsman. The above work is scarce in any state, but particularly so in colours and varnish, in which state the plates have the appearance of oil paintings.\\" In 2006 a British first edition sold at Christie's for ¬£3,600 ($6,401 then) and in 2016 an American edition sold for $1,845 (¬£1,494 then). Before Catton's book had been published, Thomas Bewick, who had been preparing his own book with monochrome woodcut engravings, A General History of Quadrupeds (1790), got into \\"a pitch of nervous curiosity\\" about the forthcoming competition. However, when he saw Catton's work he thought the prints were feeble and the book was considerably overpriced ‚Äì when \\"Quadrupeds\\" was published in 1790 it was \\"greeted with delight\\". What Catton had called an \\"animal of the bear kind\\" (and what is now known as a sloth bear) made its appearance in Bewick's second, 1791, edition of \\"Quadrupeds\\" although it was not named in any way. At the end of the 18th century it was controversial whether this creature was a bear-like sloth or a sloth-like bear and the matter was still worthy of comment in Richard Owen's 1833 Zoological Magazine where Bewick is praised but Catton is given a slightly adverse review: Bewick's engravings in Quadrupeds were not beyond all criticism. Bewick's brother John was dealing with the publishers and wrote to Thomas: To remedy this sorry situation Bewick cut out part of his wood block and inserted a new piece of wood so that he could engrave a tail. Animals included Table of Contents for Catton's book Despite the title of Catton's book the animals were not all drawn from nature and not even from life as his individual texts sometimes acknowledge. =Identifications of animals= Catton did not use Linnaean taxonomy and his descriptions were those of an artist experienced in careful observation, not of an experienced naturalist. Hence, except when he uses the same name as is extant (even if rather archaic), this section records what experienced naturalists have later claimed are the specific identifications (sometimes from first-hand knowledge) or what Catton himself said were other naturalists' identifications. No attempt is made here to make identifications based on Catton's physical or behavioural descriptions, or from his illustrations. *Plate 1 and Plate 2.

As a two-year-old he was one of the best colts of his generation in Ireland, winning the National Stakes and being placed in both the Railway Stakes and the Royal Lodge Stakes. In the following spring he recorded his biggest success with an upset victory over The Minstrel and Nebbiolo in the Irish 2,000 Guineas but failed to reproduce the form and was well-beaten in his last three races. He made a very promising start as a breeding stallion but died in 1979 after only two seasons at stud. Background Pampapaul was a \\"rangy, strong\\" chestnut horse with a white star and muzzle and three white socks bred in Ireland by his owner Hans Paul. The colt was sent into training in County Kildare with Stuart Murless, the younger brother of the English trainer Noel Murless. Although he was overshadowed by the reputation of his brother, Stuart Murless had a long and successful training career, recording major successes with Nocturnal Spree, Royal Highway (1958 Irish St. Leger) and Sicilian Prince (1962 Prix Royal Oak). His sire Yellow God who won the Gimcrack Stakes and the Prix du Palais-Royal as well as finishing second to Nijinsky in the 2000 Guineas. He stood as a breeding stallion in Europe before being exported to Japan in the summer of 1973. The best of his progeny included Nebbiolo and the Japanese Derby winner Katsu Top Ace. Pampapaul's dam Pampalina was a top-class staying racemare who won the Irish Oaks in 1967. She was a half-sister to Short Commons, the female-line ancestor of Victoire Pisa and Arctic Owl. Racing career =1976: two-year-old season= Pampapaul finished second in his first two races before contesting a maiden over six furlongs at the Curragh in June and recorded his first success despite hanging to the left in the closing stages. He was then moved up in class for the Railway Stakes over the same course and distance and was equipped with blinkers for the first time. After a slow start he made rapid progress approaching the final furlong but was hampered in the closing stages and finished third behind Brahms and Roman Charger. In the National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in September the colt was matched against seven opponents including Roman Charger, Lordedaw (runner-up in the Coventry Stakes) and the favoured Captain James. Pampapaul showed his difficult temperament both before and during the race. After being reluctant to enter the starting stalls he took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish but then began to hang badly to the left. He nevertheless won decisively, coming home two and a half lengths clear of Captain James. Later that month Pampapaul was sent to England and started favourite for the Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. Despite his jockey's attempts to restrain him he disputed the lead from the start and set a very strong pace which left most of his opponents struggling. He weakened in the final furlong and was beaten a length into second place by Gairloch. =1977: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Pampapaul looked less than fully fit when finishing fifth behind Lordedaw in the Tetrarch Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in April. In the Irish 2000 Guineas on 14 May the colt was partnered by the Italian jockey Gianfranco Dettori and started at odds of 16/1 in a twenty-one runner field. The Minstrel started favourite ahead of Nebbiolo whilst the other runners included Artaius, Lordedaw, Ballad Rock, Roman Charger as well as the British challengers Bona- Mia and Pollerton. Dettori tracked the leaders before switching to the outside to deliver his challenge in the last quarter mile. Pampapaul took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the challenge of The Minstrel to win by a short head with Nebbiolo a length away in third place. Before he took the lead, a ding-dong battle raged between Nebbiolo (who had won the English 2,000 Guineas) and The Minstrel (who was to win the English Derby), memorably described on the radio by Michael O‚ÄôHehir, who cried out, as those two horses ran inside the final furlong, \\"And here comes Pampapaul!\\", almost as if it was expected, as indeed it was by all the regulars of The Pickerel Inn, Cambridge who had bet on it that morning at odds of 22/1 on the excellent and well- celebrated advice of one of their number, Charles (later Sir Charles) Colthurst, Baronet. Pampapaul was moved up in distance to contest the 198th running of The Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse in June but after tracking the leaders he was unable to make any progress in the straight and finished seventh behind The Minstrel. Two weeks later he was dropped back in distance for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot and finished fourth of the seven runners behind Don, Marinsky and Tachypous. On his only subsequent appearance he was sent to France for the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August and finished last of the seven runners behind Flying Water. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the Irish Free Handicap or 1976, Pampapaul was assigned a weight of 122 pounds, making him the fifth-best juvenile of the season behind Cloonlara, Godswalk, Padroug and The Minstrel. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 119, twelve pounds below their best two-year-old colt Blushing Groom.

The operation took place between 21 June and 11 July 1943 and included an organized campaign of sabotage in Greece, to deceive the Axis Powers into believing that Greece was the target of an Allied amphibious landing, instead of Sicily. Despite the mission's success, the Greek civilian population suffered from mass reprisals and British intervention into the internal affairs of the Greek resistance exacerbated the tensions between its various components. Background On 28 October 1940, Italy began the Italo-Greek War, expecting a swift victory but the invasion failed and the Italians were pushed back into Albania. As the war dragged on into its sixth month, Germany was forced to intervene to support its struggling ally. The small Greek force defending the Greco‚ÄìBulgarian border was defeated by the better-equipped and numerically-superior Germans. The German penetration deep into Greece made further resistance at the Albanian front pointless, ending the Battle of Greece in the favor of the Axis Powers, the British conducted an evacuation and Greece was subjected to a Triple Occupation by Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. Unlike Italy and Germany, Bulgaria did not administer Eastern Macedonia and Thrace through Greek collaborators but annexed the area to form the province of Belomorie. The first resistance organization in Greece was founded in May 1941; Eleutheria (Liberty) was a common front ranging from communists to Venizelists. The group was short lived as internal political disagreements and the work of Axis intelligence services suppressed its activities and bands belonging to the communist-led Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), became the dominant resistance organization in the country. Right-wing resistance organizations such as National Republican Greek League (EDES), National and Social Liberation (EKKA) and Defenders of Northern Greece (YBE) played a much smaller role. In June 1943, the head of the British Special Operations Executive mission in Greece, Brigadier Eddie Myers, conceived the Agreement of National Groups. Under the terms of the agreement, ELAS and the right-wing EDES and EKKA, united under a common general staff consisting of Myers and the leaders of the units, while also accepting the seniority of the British Middle East Command (General Henry Maitland Wilson). The accord was to pave the way for Operation Animals, part of Operation Barclay, a plan to deceive the Axis powers into believing that the Allied invasion of southern Europe would be in Greece and not Sicily. In late 1942, with on-going Allied success in the North African Campaign, the thoughts of the military planners turned to the next target. British planners considered that an invasion of France from Britain could not take place until 1944, and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, wanted to use the Allied forces from North Africa to attack Europe's \\"soft underbelly\\". There were two possible targets for the Allies to attack. The first option was Sicily; control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy. The second option was into Greece and the Balkans, to trap the German forces present between the British and American invaders and the Soviets. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily ‚Äì codenamed Operation Husky ‚Äì and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July that year. There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice ‚Äì Churchill is reputed to have said \\"Everyone but a bloody fool would know that it's Sicily\\" ‚Äì and that the build- up of resources for the invasion would be detected. Adolf Hitler was concerned about a Balkan invasion, as the area had been the source of raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis ‚Äì which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion ‚Äì reduced radio traffic by using land- lines wherever possible. On 29 May, Myers was informed by Cairo that Sicily was to be invaded in the second week of July and ordered that Greek resistance organizations were to commence Operation Animals a sabotage campaign throughout Greece. The operation was to begin on 21 June and last until 14 July and Myers immediately contacted local SOE agents and the leadership of ELAS, which agreed to participate in the operation. The strategically important Gorgopotamos bridge which had been destroyed during Operation Harling had been repaired and was to be blown again. Myers proposed to destroy the bridge across the river Asopus but the ELAS commander Stefanos Sarafis, thought it too dangerous and proposed to demolish the Kournovo tunnel; Myers eventually gave in and supplied ELAS with explosives. On the night of 1 June, an ELAS engineer unit, accompanied by 250 fighters, blew up the tunnel while a train loaded with ammunition and Italian soldiers on leave was passing through. About 200‚Äì300 Italians and seven Germans were killed while 100 more suffered burn injuries and 60 Greek prisoners of war perished in the explosions that followed. The tunnel suffered no serious damage and the Germans repaired the railroad tracks a week later. The Italian army conducted the reprisal killing of 106 prisoners of war in the Larissa concentration camp. On 20 June, a group of six SOE officers evaded German guards to scale a steep slope near the Asopus bridge, place explosives at its northern end and set them off. Upon hearing about the demolition, Adolf Hitler expressed his dissatisfaction with the level of protection of the Greek railroad network, while also acknowledging that such subversive acts could not be wholly avoided. The damage caused to the bridge severed the railroad connection between northern and southern Greece until 28 August and paved the way for Operation Animals. Operation On the night of 20 June 1943, five bridges were blown up along the Katerini‚ÄìLamia railroad, destroying of tracks. In the area of Litochoro, a Macedonian ELAS unit eliminated a small garrison guarding the bridge and disarmed a Hellenic Gendarmerie patrol, before destroying the adjacent bridge. Another group blew up the bridge and cut the telephone line at the village of Petrana between Kozani and Servia. Animals then began in Macedonia; the Germans reinforced their garrisons and arrested hundreds of civilians and forced them to lift mines on the railroads, under threat of death. The civilians were to find explosives by poking about the tracks with sticks and then defuse them, which limited the scope of the Macedonian phase of the operation. In the early morning of 21 June, a column of the 117th J√§ger Division was ambushed by a party of 100 ELAS, while passing through the narrow Sarantaporo pass. In an eight-hour exchange of fire, 11 Germans were killed, 97 surrendered, and five escaped. The Sarantaporo bridge and the 64 cars and trucks belonging to the column were destroyed. The captured German soldiers were killed several days later after being interrogated. Alexander L√∂hr's telegraphs of 22‚Äì23 June, describe a systematic campaign of sabotage against Greek telecommunications and transport networks and the monthly report of Army Group E for June echoed this, adding that the sabotage actions were intended to isolate the south of Greece. On the morning of 24 June, 20 American aircraft bombed the Thermi airfield, where 8 German soldiers were killed and 70 were injured. The runways and 70 percent of its facilities were destroyed along with 10 aircraft, while 15 more were damaged. Information on the airfield location were provided by the Zeus resistance organisation of Thessaloniki. On 24 June, the 1st Mountain Division was ordered to clear the Sarantaporo pass of any scrap and mines left behind and build a temporary bridge. On 25 June, German guards repelled an attack on the Bralos bridge, later defusing an explosive device. On the night of 28 June, eight charges were detonated along the Leptokarya‚ÄìLitochoro railroad line, damaging it slightly. The following day, insurgents assassinated Adolf Ersfeld, the commander of the 621st Army Secret Police Unit, on the Thessaloniki‚ÄìEdessa highway. On 27 June, Allied raids on the Eleusina and Kalamaki airfields killed 16 Germans and 32 Greeks, 59 people were injured and 12 aeroplanes destroyed. On 1 July, the 1st Mountain Division and two Italian regiments enacted an anti‚Äìpartisan operation in the vicinity of Servia and after their rendezvous, the operation was converted to a punitive expedition. The expedition lasted until 5 June and resulted in the burning of 16 villages, the killing of 92 civilians and the looting of large numbers of cattle. After the departure of the Mountain Division towards Ioannina, the area was declared a dead zone and placed under the control of collaborationists under the command of Georgios Poulos. On 2 July, 50 prisoners of war were killed at Vyrsodepseia in reprisal for Ersfeld's death and later in the day, insurgents skirmished with a German patrol at Platamonas. On 3 July, insurgents shot at a German car, wounding a passenger and blew up a railroad tracks outside Litochoro. On the night of 4 July, the Leptokarya‚ÄìLitochoro railroad was sabotaged once more leading to the derailing of an ammunition train and in the ensuing explosion 10 Germans were wounded. At the same time a German outpost between Katerini and Pyrgetos was attacked. German reprisals led to the killing of 10 prisoners of war in Thessaloniki and the destruction of part of Litochoro. On the night of 11 July, a bridge was blown up north-west of Lamia as a German column passed through and 25 wagons of ammunition were destroyed. The following day Germans killed 13 people accused of carrying out the bombing. On 11 July, Myers ordered the cessation of the operation as the landings on Sicily had begun. Aftermath Hitler had been deceived as to the real location of the Allied landing, believing that Sardinia and the Peloponnese were more likely to be the target. Following the landing at Sicily, the staff of Army Group E continued to expect a second landing in Greece for a short time, anticipating that the Greek resistance would act as a fifth column. Despite the success of the operation, Maitland Wilson admitted that the civilian population of Greece had suffered much in the German reprisals. This was partially due to inefficient planning by ELAS, which failed to provide the civilian population with adequate warning of German reprisals. Following the end of the operation Greece lost what little strategic importance it had in the Allied war effort. Operation Animals fostered the expansion of right-wing resistance groups such as EDES and YBE to counterbalance the dominant ELAS. As part of this effort, the leadership of YBE agreed to embrace armed struggle, forming guerilla bands in rural areas. In July 1943, YBE was renamed Panhellenic Liberation Organization (PAO). The formation of PAO strained relations with ELAS and no effort was made to combine their operations. PAO managed to gain the support of the Turkish-speaking Pontic Greeks, who maintained independent resistance networks and were also anti-communist. In August, ELAS fighters in the area of Kilkis began pressuring PAO insurgents into disarming. When ELAS applied the same tactic on the Turkish-speaking Pontians, the latter murdered seven regional ELAS commanders in the village of Imera, near Kozani. By the end of the month the conflict between the two groups had escalated into a civil war, which continued until December. ELAS managed to destroy PAO's armed units, before they managed to regroup in Chalkidiki. Exploiting a mutiny within the Greek government-in-exile in Egypt, ELAS also clashed with EKKA and EDES. In an effort to solidify its position before the anticipated return of king George II of Greece from exile, whom ELAS vehemently opposed. In January 1944, the remnants of PAO, consisting of several hundred men, requested aid from the German authorities and they were reformed into collaborationist, counter- insurgency units. Under German direction, PAO took part in operations against ELAS, while attacking the Bulgarian army, with the tacit approval of the Germans. From then on PAO operated under the umbrella of the collaborationist Security Battalions, committing numerous atrocities. ELAS remained the dominant resistance organization in Greece until the end of the war. The Treaty of Varkiza significantly weakened the communists, while the Greek army and gendarmerie were reformed with former members of anti-communist resistance organizations, including ex-collaborators. The Greek Civil War continued until the communists were defeated in 1949.

The current buildings date from the 18th to the 19th century. The abbey and the church are protected heritage. During the French Revolution the buildings were sold, at the same time monastic life of Hemiksem was destroyed. In the 19th century the abbey resurrected thanks to the support of Cardinal Mauro Cappellari (later Pope Gregory XVI), the old monks of Hemiksem returned in Bornem. In 1835 Mgr Corselis gave the new monastic community the same rights as the old Abbey of Hemiksem. The first abbot, Robertus van Ommeren, was ordained in Rome. The monastic life flourished and the abbey refounded Val-Dieu Abbey in 1844. During the First World War the abbey becomes a strategic point in the defence of Klein-Brabant. In 1914 the abbey church tower was used as a lookout, and a target of the German artillery. At the end of battle the tower stood as the last major strategic point in Bornem. The community is active in the local parish of Bornem and of great importance of local cultural life. The monks have an abbey beer, named Bornem, which is brewed by Brouwerij Van Steenberge. However at the end of the 20th century the number of monks decreased drastically and today only two monks, including Abbot van Schaverbeeck are living in the conventual buildings.Theo Derkinderen Abt Leo Van Schaverbeeck is al vijftig jaar priester, Het Nieuwsblad, 31 March 2017.

During the first half of the 20th century, writing by women reflected feminist ideas as well as the political upheavals of the time. Although women achieved a more equal social status once the Communist regime came to power, most women's writing of that period conveyed little expression of a distinctive feminine perspective.  Early female writers  Cai, loosely translated as \\"literary talent\\", is an attribute describing profound lyricism, deep intellectuality and analytic skill.Larson, W. (1998). Women and Writing in Modern China. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. Although it was acknowledged that both women and men possessed cai, the phrase nuren wucai bian shi de Â•≥‰∫∫ÁÑ°Êâç‰æøÊòØÂæ∑ (for women, lack of literary talent is a virtue) summarizes the dominant sentiment that the literary field was traditionally a domain for men. Despite this belief, works authored by women play an integral part throughout Chinese history. There were a number of women writers prior to the 20th century who were respected by the intelligentsia of their era, even if much of their work was considered less important than men's work in general.Chang. K.S. & Saussy. H. (Eds.). (1999). Women writers of traditional China: An anthology of poetry and criticism. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp. 1‚Äì44. Female writers helped to bring forth themes such as romance, marriage, gender roles and the politics surrounding women. The first women recorded in biography and bibliography were poets. The aesthetic nature of poetry was highly regarded, while fiction was viewed as an avenue taken because of a failed career or commercial venture. A marked increase in female literacy took place during the Late Imperial Era. One of the more notable poets of this time was Mao Xiuhui, a 16th-century poet who wrote a poem based on her husband's failure to gain a position as civil servant; the poem draws parallels between the male and female as they suffer hardships in the political and domestic arenas respectively. Other notable female poets in Chinese history were Gao Zhixian, Xue Tao, and Li Qingzhao.  20th-century writers and feminism  The beginning of the century marked a period of growing unrest for women as the feminist movement took hold. Women of this period were faced with the dilemma of protesting oppressive ideals stemming from Confucian ideology or remaining true to their family and maintaining peace and order. Literary discourse at the time was highly influenced by this social movement. Women Writers of the time authored works reflecting the feminist sentiment and the issues that came with revolution.Schaeffer, Kay & Xianlin, Song. (2007). Unruly Spaces: Gender, Women'‚Äô Writing and Indigenous Feminism in China. Journal of Gender Studies, 16 (1), 17‚Äì30 Eileen Chang, Lu Yin, Shi Pingmei and Ding Ling, were four of the most influential feminist writers of the time. In the 1920s and 1930s, Freudian psychoanalysis gained favour with Chinese feminists looking to study gender relationships, thus becoming a topic of many feminist writers throughout the early and mid portions of the 20th century. When Mao came to power in 1949, he addressed the issue of women's rights and tried to establish women's equality through the \\"iron girls\\" of national development ideal. Through this philosophy, long-standing practices such as foot binding, prostitution and trafficking of women were abolished. Women were given the opportunity to own land, divorce, and join the military and other employment fields.Laurence, S. (2008.) Mao‚Äôs ghost. The Boston Phoenix. Retrieved from the web December 8, 2009. http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/66069-maos-ghost/. The establishment of this ideology, however, did not liberate women; instead, it undermined the feminine voice by forcing women to take a male-oriented stance on public and domestic policy. Literature authored during this time reflects the restrictive and masculine perspective of women writers during this period. This \\"Mulanian\\" style of writing submerged true feminine identity, rendering the female perspective neglected and hidden in the male- dominated political and aesthetic arenas.Jinhua, Z. (2009).

Hau'ofa, whose broadcasting career spanned more than fifty years, has been called \\"the voice of Papua New Guinea\\" for his focus on the country's economic, political and social issues. He was a long- time fixture at NBC PNG, the state-owned radio station, and, more recently, FM100, where he hosted the \\"Talk Back Show\\". His constant presence on the radio made him a \\"household name in PNG.\\" Roger Hau'ofa was born on December 28, 1943, on Misima Island, Territory of Papua, in present-day Milne Bay Province. His parents, Isikeli Hau'ofa and Mele Sikimeti, were Christian missionaries from Tonga. Hau'ofa had four siblings - two sisters and two brothers. Hau'ofa's broadcasts become popular and highly influential throughout rural and urban areas of Papua New Guinea with low literacy rates. According to Martyn Namorong, one of PNG's leading writers and social commentators, Hau'ofa helped to shape national policy on key issues by exposing residents in rural areas to important, national issues. As Namorong explained to RNZI following Hau'ofa's death in 2017, \\"Levels of literacy are very low. In some parts of PNG you only have 30% of the population that can read and write...So radio and oral culture is still very strong. It's just about someone being able to negotiate that space and win the audience over. And that's where the gap is.\\" Hau'ofa suffered from a lengthy illness with kidney failure for over year, as well as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. He spent much of February 2017 hospitalized at Pacific International Hospital in Port Moresby. On March 2, following his wishes, Hau'ofa was released from the hospital and flown by Helifix medical helicopter to his wife's home village of home village of Iare in Kairuku District, Central Province. Roger Hau'ofa died from complications of kidney failure in Iare at 11:42 p.m. on March 4, 2017, at the age of 73. He was survived by his wife, Pauline, nine children, approximately twenty grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. Hau'ofa's funeral was held at the Sir John Guise Stadium in Port Moresby on March 10, 2017. He was buried in Iare, Central Province. His death comes just months after the passing of another influential member of the PNG media, newspaper pioneer Oseah Philemon, who died in December 2016.

Life and works  Luitgard (also Lutgard) of Wittichen was born in 1291 in Schenkenzell in the Black Forest and came from a simple, peasant background. At the age of twelve she was admitted to a beguine house in Oberwolfach in the valley of the river Wolf, where she lived for 20 years in voluntary poverty. As the result of a vision of Christ she was called to found a convent. She went on trips to the Tyrol and Switzerland to raise funds for the founding of the convent. She was treated unjustly by the dukes of Teck at the nearby castle of Schiltach, while the lords of Geroldseck at the Schenkenburg were devoted to her.Hugo Schneider, Burgen und Schl√∂sser in Mittelbaden. Historischer Verein f√ºr Mittelbaden 1984, p. 461 In 1324 Luitgard moved to the Wittichen valley and founded a hermitage (Klause) for herself and 33 other women, which later became the tertiary convent of Wittichen. The number of women was based on the 33-line Canticle of the Sun, a canticle by Saint Francis of Assisi, although the number of women doubled even in Luitgard's lifetime. She was the abbess of the convent until her death. Luitgard cared for victims of the plague, before she herself succumbed to the epidemic. She is worshipped in central Baden as a \\"people's saint\\" (Volksheilige) even though she was never ordained or raised to the sainthood. She is remembered on 16 October, the date she died. On the second Sunday in October, the Luitgard Festival takes place in Wittichen. Luitgard is believed to have been familiar with the writings of Meister Eckhart and Heinrich Seuse and is regarded as a mystic in her own right. Luitgard died on 16 October 1348 at Wittichen Abbey near Schenkenzell. This founder of a convent, who has been described as charismatic, may be seen from today's perspective as an emancipated woman.Ulrich Gaier, Literatur vom Neckar bis zum Bodensee 1000-1800. Vol. 3, Part 1, p. 402, Verlag Oberschw√§bische Elektrizit√§tswerke (OEW) 2003, Her spiritual father, the priest, Berchtold of Bombach, published a biography of Luitgard in around 1350. In 1629, according to tradition, when her coffin was opened, her brain was found to be in completely sound condition, a phenomenon that could not be explained by doctors or chemists at that time and, being seen as a miracle, was the reason for subsequent worship and pilgrimages. The St. Luitgard Care Home in Oberwolfach is named after her.

John is known to have met with the Greek Orthodox patriarch, corresponded with him, and exchanged gifts on a feast-day. Following the reconquest, and subsequent expulsion of the Muslim population of Melitene in the early 10th century AD, the Romans invited Syriac Orthodox adherents to repopulate of the city of Melitene and its hinterland, however, the doctrinal differences between the Syriac Orthodox and Greek Orthodox created conflict.Chitwood (2017), pp. 138-139 The conduct of Bar Abdoun led John, Bishop of Melitene, to denounce him to Alexius Studites, Patriarch of Constantinople, and Constantine VIII, the successor of Basil II, not long before his death in 1028.Chitwood (2017), p. 139 In 1029, John of Melitene repeated his condemnations to Romanos III, Constantine's successor, who subsequently sent word to John Chrysoberges, the krites (civil governor) of Melitene, to arrest Bar Abdoun and other Syriac Orthodox clergymen. Chrysoberges attempted to convince Bar Abdoun to flee to Muslim territory. Failing that, Chrysoberges reluctantly arrested Bar Abdoun, six high-ranking bishops, and 20 monks,Mayeur et al. (1993), p. 335 and sent them to Constantinople to be judged before a synodal tribunal.Eastmond (2017) The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch did not attend the tribunal in protest of the actions of his coreligionists.Cigaar & Metcalf (2006), p. 10 The Romans unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the majority of the clergymen to abandon the Syriac Orthodox Church,Hussey (2010) p. 129 and, as a result, in October 1029, Bar Abdoun and the others were excommunicated and banished to the Monastery of Ganos in Thrace. According to the edict of Alexius, issued in May 1030, three Syriac Orthodox bishops that accompanied Bar Abdoun converted to Greek Orthodoxy to avoid exile. The edict was issued against the Syriac Orthodox population of Melitene, but lacked the support of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, and another edict was issued in 1032, with the support of the new Greek Orthodox patriarch. During Bar Abdoun's exile, the Syriac Orthodox population of the Roman Empire suffered persecution as the authorities attempted to destroy sacred books at Antioch and profaned the cross and Eucharist at the Syriac Orthodox church in Constantinople.Ahrweiler & Laiou (1998), p. 85 Bar Abdoun remained in exile at the Monastery of Ganos until his death on 2 February 1033.

Biography  Herman Coster was born on 30 June 1865 in Alkmaar in the Netherlands. He went to school at the H.B.S. in Alkmaar, and the Stedelijk Gymnasium in Leiden. After, he studied law at the Leiden University, where he became president of the student corps. His uncle, a Hague-based doctor, T.H. Blom Coster, was the patron of his studies. As a student Herman Coster sympathized with the Young Flemish Movement. He completed his PhD in 1890 writing his thesis on Public Voluntary Auctions. He moved to the South African Republic after his family experienced bankruptcy. Here he became a lawyer, and between 1895-1897, at request of President Paul Kruger, he served as state attorney. After Kruger insulted the 'Hollanders', Coster resigned his position and returned to working as a lawyer. During the South African War (1899-1902), Coster joined the Hollanderkorps: a voluntary unit of Boer foreign volunteers consisting of 130 men and which had been established a mere month earlier. The Battle of Elandslaagte was both the first and last battle that the Corps participated in. Coster, then a lieutenant, was killed at the Battle of Elandslaagte, along with fellow officer Cars Geerts de Jonge and seven soldiers: P.J. van den Broek, H. van Cittert, J.A. Lepeltak Kieft, Jan Moora, J.Th. Rummeling, M. Schaink, and F.W. Wagner. Another 35 of others were taken prisoner, among them Willem Frederik Mondriaan (brother of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian). The names of the deceased, including Coster, were inscribed at a monument at the location of the battle. The monument was destroyed by vandals in 2014. After his death, Coster was lauded as a hero in the Netherlands and several hagiographies were published. In 1900 the Herman Coster Fund was established in Leiden for Afrikaans and Dutch students. In November 1901 a plaque commemorating Coster was added to the Leiden Academiegebouw. Hermanus Coster Street in The Hague was named after Coster in 1904. This street is located in the Transvaal neighbourhood of The Hague that was established at this time. In 1915 the name was changed to Herman Coster Street. Today this is the location of the Haagse Markt. Another Herman Coster Street is located nearby in Wassenaar. Coster's hometown of Alkmaar also has a street named after him. There are also streets named after Coster in the Transvaal neighbourhoods of Leeuwarden and Rotterdam, as well as in Pretoria in South Africa. Coster and the Hollanderkorps were featured as part of the exhibition 'Good Hope: South Africa and the Netherlands from 1600' held at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 2017.

For most of its existence, it has been the largest telecom operator in Switzerland that is neither state-owned nor a subsidiary of an international corporation. History In 1997, a few months before the liberalization of the Swiss telecom market, Adel F. Labib and Fran√ßois Callegaro, formerly employed at the AT&T; international headquarters in Geneve, submitted the request for a telecom license to OFCOM. This made OFCOM change its licensing requirements, as it had required the submissions to include three-year revenue statements, never envisaging the possibility that a local telecom operator could start from zero. T√©l√©sonique SA was founded in August 1998 with a starting capital of one million Swiss francs. As the fourth telecom provider to enter the Swiss market, the company offered fixed telephony services and a Geneve hub for international operators. T√©l√©sonique was the first Swiss operator to offer a unique tariff for calls to neighboring countries and the first to introduce electronic invoicing. It also introduced a prepaid offer. A year later, the company attracted national attention when it opposed OFCOM's auction of wireless local loop concessions for the initial price of 6 million francs. However, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland rejected the complaint. T√©l√©sonique was the first Swiss telecom operator that worked together with a humanitarian organization. In 2000, five per cent of the revenue of the company's fixed network and prepaid cards went to M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res for the project \\"HELP Africa.\\" In 2001, as the telecom deregulation bubble burst, T√©l√©sonique took over the Swiss subsidiaries of NETnet, Facilicom and One.Tel, as well as NETnet Liechtenstein. It gained more than 100,000 subscribers and a hub in Z√ºrich that was 20 times bigger than the one in Geneva. The Swiss market was dominated by four large telecom operators: majority state-owned Swisscom as the biggest player, followed by Sunrise, Orange and Tele2 as subsidiaries of international companies. T√©l√©sonique, the largest independent competitor, was present in western Switzerland and hoping for complete market liberalization. Its first acquisition outside Switzerland (and Liechtenstein) came in 2005, when T√©l√©sonique acquired the assets of Select One, a German Voice over IP provider. It allowed T√©l√©sonique to introduce a new service in Switzerland, called Bypass, which offered very low call prices to the users who prefixed the called number with a series of ten digits. It was made possible by \\"bypassing\\" the last mile of Swisscom, as well as Swisscom mobile. The number of Swiss telecoms was further reduced in 2008, when Tele2 was bought by Sunrise. T√©l√©sonique opposed the takeover, arguing that it eliminated the only big mobile operator in Switzerland that was not state-owned or had a historical monopoly position. Awards T√©l√©sonique won the 2003 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the startup category.

Built in 1929 and twice enlarged, it is a prominent local example of the Beaux Arts style, and was the town's first purpose-built high school. Since 1988, it has served as Fitch Court, a senior housing complex managed by the local housing authority. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The former John Fitch School stands west of Windsor's village center, on the north side of Bloomfield Avenue (Connecticut Route 305), between Mack Street and Hayden Avenue. It is a complex of three constructions, consisting of the original main block and two large ells. All are single-story or 1-1/2 story masonry structures, built out of buff brick with stone trim. The main block was originally covered by a distinctive green tile roof; this has been replaced by asphalt architectural shingles. At its center is an octagonal cupola with green dome. The main entrance is set in a recess framed by bracketed hood and topped by a Flemish gable, in which a bas-relief of the school's namesake is set in a medallion. John Fitch was a local militia member who died in King Philip's War. The school was built in 1921-22 to a design by William Henry McClean, an architect from Boston, Massachusetts. The school was an unusual departure from Connecticut schools of the period, which were typically Colonial Revival in style and built out of red brick. Its two enlargements, in 1929 and 1934, added classroom capacity. The school was readapted as a senior housing facility in 1988.

Elections to South Lanarkshire Council were held on 4 May 2017 on the same day as the 31 other local authorities in Scotland. The election used the twenty wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 64 Councillors being elected, a reduction of 3 members from 2012. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. Following the 2017 election, the Scottish National Party attempted to form a coalition with Labour and the Liberal Democrats which was unsuccessful. The SNP then formed a minority administration.

Being one of the eleven Premier Events of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, the winner of the tournament automatically qualified for the Capcom Cup in December 2017. This was the 15th NorCal Regionals event and the second to feature a \\"death pool\\" for competitors who failed to register ahead of time. The tournament was won by Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley, who spent much of the final match taunting his opponent NuckleDu. Background NorCal Regionals 2017 was hosted in Sacramento, California on April 14-16. Much like in 2016, NorCal Regionals 2017 featured a \\"death pool\\" for all competitors that registered on-site rather than in advance. Tournament organizer John Choi stated that this featured returned because \\"people really liked [having] exciting matches right off the bat.\\" The winner of the 2016 death pool, Martin \\"Marn\\" Phan, registered in time, but told ESPN that he planned to de-register himself so he can battle through the death pool again, stating that he wanted to do it every year. Competitors in NorCal Regionals 2017 included NuckleDu, Tatsuya Haitani, Yusuke Momochi, Justin Wong, Daigo Umehara, Tokido, Fuudo, and Eduardo \\"PR Balrog\\" Perez. A few days before NorCal regionals, Evo 2016-winner Lee \\"Infiltration\\" Seon-woo announced through Twitter that he had canceled his flight tickets for Sacramento, stating that he was not yet ready to attend Capcom Pro Tour events. NorCal Regionals also features other fighting game tournaments, such as for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Tekken 7. Finale The finale of NorCal Regionals 2017 came down between Capcom Cup 2016-champion Du \\"NuckleDu\\" Dang and Panda Global's Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley. After NuckleDu bested Punk in the winners semifinals, Punk entered the finals from the loser's side of the brackets and had to beat NuckleDu in two best-of-five sets in order to win the tournament. Punk won the first set three-to-one, using the character Karin to counter many of his opponent's Guile's attacks. After this, Punk started to play mind games, distracting NuckleDu on the character selection screen and teabagging during subsequent matches. After a successful combo or stun attack, Punk frequently pressed \\"down\\" on his controller to make Karin crouch, taunting his opponent. Punk took the second match three-to-one as well, winning the tournament. NuckleDu is known for teabagging himself as well. After the tournament, Punk told Kotaku that he uses teabagging to undermine and distract his opponents, stating that the taunt \\"gets in certain people's heads and messes them up.\\" Though this behavior was answered by laughs and cheers from the crowd, Punk's teabagging proved controversial throughout the fighting game community.

The charges had been brought following his establishment of a guild whose members had established control of governance of the city, including taxation controls beneficial to its members. As a result of this type of behaviour, Andrew and many other merchants in the guild were unpopular with the citizens to the extent that during his 1309 term as Mayor, he was attacked by a man with a knife.

It served as infantry on the Western Front and in Ireland during the First World War, and as an air defence unit during The Blitz and the campaign in North West Europe during the Second World War. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. One such unit was the 11th (1st Preston) Lancashire RVC, formed at Preston, Lancashire, on 4 October 1859 under the command of Henry Newsham Pedder, late of the 3rd Royal Lancashire Militia and grandson of the founder of Preston's first bank.Frederick, pp. 190‚Äì1.Westlake, pp. 143‚Äì4.Beckett, Appendix VII.Lancashire Record Office, Handlist 72.Pedder at Preston Digital Archive. In February 1860 the unit absorbed two other Preston corps, the 12th (2nd Preston) RVC and the 30th (Fishwick) RVC, becoming a three-company corps. In July 1861 one of the original captains, William Henry Goodair, a member of a local cotton manufacturing family, took over as Major-Commandant.Army List, various dates.'First Citizens of Preston', Lancashire Evening Post, 11 April 2007. The corps became part of the 6th Administrative Battalion of Lancashire RVCs formed in September 1861, the other units being the 44th at Longton, the 59th at Leyland, and the 61st (two companies) at Chorley. The 6th Admin Battalion had its headquarters at Preston.Frederick, pp. 190‚Äì1. In July 1865 the 11th Lancashire RVC was given special permission to adopt The Preston Rifle Volunteer Corps as its official designation.London Gazette 28 July1865. The 11th absorbed the 44th RVC in 1866 and the 61st RVC in November 1868, reaching a strength of eight companies. Goodair was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1867, and Captain George H. Lightoller of the 61st RVC became Major in 1868. Simultaneously Goodair was major of the 6th Admin Bn commanded by Lt-Col Sir Thomas Hesketh, Bt. (The Pedder, Goodair and Lightoller families recur among the names of the unit's officers over the next few decades.) Under the scheme of 'localisation' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, Regular infantry battalions became linked in pairs assigned to particular counties or localities, and the county Militia and Volunteers were affiliated to them. From 1873 the 6th Admin Bn was attached to 'Sub-District No 12', headquartered in Preston and brigaded with the 47th Foot, the 81st Foot and the 3rd Royal Lancashire Militia.Training Depots, 1873‚Äì1881 at Regiments.org archive site. In the reorganisation of the Volunteers in 1880, the whole 6th Admin Bn was consolidated on 16 March as the 11th Lancashire RVC with the following dispositions: * HQ at Preston * A to E Companies at Preston * F Company at Leyland * G, H and J Companies at Chorley. Its uniform was scarlet with white facings. On 1 July 1881 the unit became a Volunteer Battalion of the Preston- based Loyal North Lancashire Regiment formed from the 47th and 81st Foot (Regulars) and 3rd Royal Lancashire Militia under the Childers Reforms. It was designated the 1st Volunteer Battalion from 1 February 1883. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì86.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì61. The Volunteer Battalions of the Loyals were assigned to the Mersey Brigade, which was later split up and the Loyals reassigned to the Northern Counties Brigade based in Preston. In 1902 this was also split, the Loyals staying with the new North East Lancashire Brigade in Preston. Finally, in 1906 the brigade was entitled the North Lancashire Brigade and two battalions of the King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) were brigaded with the Loyals. During the Second Boer War the battalion formed a service company of volunteers to serve alongside the Regulars, earning the Battle honour South Africa 1900‚Äì1902.Leslie. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the battalion became the 4th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment:London Gazette 20 March 1908.Mark Conrad, The British Army 1914 (archive site) * HQ at Preston * A, C & D Companies at Preston * B Company at Longridge * E Company at Lytham * F Company at HorwichLancashire at Centenary Drill Halls. * G & H Companies at Devonshire Road, Chorley The North Lancashire Brigade now formed part of the West Lancashire Division of the TF.James, pp. 88‚Äì9.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 133‚Äì39. First World War =Mobilisation= Annual training for the West Lancashire Division had just begun at Kirkby Lonsdale when war was declared on 4 August 1914, and the units at once returned to their headquarters for mobilisation. On 10 August the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and all the units of the West Lancashire Division did so.Wylly, p. 157.Coop, pp. 20‚Äì21 On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later the 2nd Line also began to serve overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 1‚Äì7. The 2/4th Bn Loyals was formed at Preston in October 1914 and became part of the 2/1st North Lancashire Bde in the 2nd West Lancashire Division. A 3/4th Bn was raised in 1915 to provide drafts to the other battalions when they were serving overseas.Loyals at Long, Long Trail.Loyals at regimental Warpath.John Downham, 'The Regiments in the Great War' at Lancashire Infantry Museum.Wylly, pp. 187, 200. =1/4th Loyals= The 1/4th Bn mobilised at 9 Avenham Lane, Preston, and moved on 22 August to Swindon in Wiltshire, and then in November to Sevenoaks in Kent.55 Division at Long, Long Trail. 51st (Highland) Division Many units of the West Lancashire Division went to France independently to provide reinforcements for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and by the end of March 1915 only the North Lancashire Brigade was left in England. The following month it was posted to 51st (Highland) Division at Bedford, which crossed to France at the beginning of May. The 1/4th Loyals disembarked at Boulogne on 4 May. Designated the 154th Brigade, the North Lancashire Brigade fought with the Highlanders for the rest of the year. The 1/4th Loyals first went into the line on 25 May in the closing stages of the Battle of Festubert.Wylly, pp. 157‚Äì60.55 Division at Regimental warpath.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 106. Givenchy The 1/4th Loyals made their first general attack on 15 June, the first day of the Battle of Givenchy. Led by C Company, it advanced at 06.00 alongside the 6th Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and at first all went well: the west end of a German salient was carried and the attackers moved on to the German main line, getting as far as the third line of trenches. However, the advance was halted by a mass of uncut wire, while B and D Companies trying to get across No man's land to support C Company suffered heavy casualties from the German counter-barrage, as did A Company in support. Although it had a lodgement in the enemy positions, 154th Bde had both flanks 'in the air'. The battalion attempted to dig in, but by midnight, with the Commanding Officer (CO), Lt-Col R. Hindle, wounded and German counter-attacks coming in, it was forced to withdraw, finally getting back to its own lines in the early morning mist of 16 June. The 1/4th Loyals had lost 431 men killed, wounded and missing, and took no further part in the battle.Wylly, pp. 160‚Äì62. In late June and July the battalion held trenches in the Laventie sector, and then in August the 51st (Highland) Division took over part of the line near the Ancre from the French. However, the weak 1/4th Bn was mainly in brigade or divisional reserve until it received a draft of 100 reinforcements from the 2/4th Bn. At the end of the year the battalion was occupying trenches near Authuille.Wylly, pp. 163‚Äì64. 55th (West Lancashire) Division Men of the Loyal North Lancashires (believed to be 1/4th Bn) of 55th (West Yorkshire) Division before the Battle of the Somme. At the beginning of 1916 the West Lancashire Division was reformed in France as the 55th (West Lancashire) Division and the 1/4th Loyals returned to it with 154 Bde (now redesignated 164th (North Lancashire) Brigade). The division reformed on 3 January at Hallencourt near Abbeville, and in February it relieved a French division in the line south of Arras.Wylly, p. 164.Coop, p. 23. During the early summer the division carried out a number of trench rais to divert attention from the Somme sector where a great offensive was being prepared. 1/4th Loyals established a specialist raiding party of 60 men under Capt E.M. Gregson. On 28 June the division laid on an elaborate daylight raid in which six battalions including 1/4th Loyals took part, with gas and smoke discharged on a two-mile frontage. Unfortunately shift in the wind made the gas and smoke only partially successful and some raiders did not get into the enemy lines. The 1/4th Loyals' party, yelling 'On the Kellys', was successful, but lost 10 killed (including Capt Gregson) and 19 wounded.Wylly, pp. 165‚Äì66.Coop, pp. 25‚Äì28. Somme The High Street of Guillemont, 1916 On 25 July, the 55th Division was relieved and travelled south to join in the Somme offensive. It moved into the line opposite Guillemont on 30 July and prepared to attack on 8 August. 164th Brigade on the left was to attack Guillemont village with two battalions assisted by two companies of 1/4th Loyals, then the remaining two companies of 1/4th Loyals were to follow up and occupy the German front line. On each of the two days before the attack, D Company attempted to seize an enemy-held ridge 150 yards in front of the division's start-line, but failed. The attack (the Battle of Guillemont) was not a success. The only progress was on the left where 1/8th Bn Liverpool Regiment (the Liverpool Irish) went through the village and D Company 1/4th Loyals moved up to consolidate the gains. However the enemy got between them and the Liverpool Irish, forcing D Company to retire. The support companies were not engaged, but still suffered heavy casualties from artillery fire. The battalion had to be brought up to strength with a draft of over 200 men from the Manchester Regiment and the East Lancashire Regiment.Wylly, pp. 166‚Äì67.Coop, pp. 30‚Äì34. British troops advancing at the Battle of Ginchy, 9 September 1916. After rest, the division moved back into the line on the night of 4/5 September to prepare for the Battle of Ginchy. The attack was made on the afternoon of 9 September behind a creeping barrage, and at Zero hour (17.25) B and C companies of 1/4th Loyals left their trenches and followed the barrage towards the first objective, a trench called Hop Alley. Unfortunately, Hop Alley was held more strongly than anticipated, with several machine guns, and an unknown trench (later called Haymarket) caused confusion and delay. If indeed the Loyals reached Hop Alley, they were unable to hold it. Casualties were again heavy and the battalion was withdrawn into reserve.Wylly, pp. 168‚Äì70.Coop, pp. 37‚Äì40. When 164th Bde attacked Gueudecourt on 27 September during the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette, 1/4th Loyals was in support and suffered few casualties. Afterwards the division left the Somme and moved north to the Ypres Salient until the end of the year. During 1916, 1/4th Loyals had lost 35 officers and 593 other ranks killed, wounded and missing.Wylly, pp. 170‚Äì71.Coop, pp. 43‚Äì44.  Pilckem Ridge The battalion remained in the salient during the early months of 1917, carrying out diversionary activities during the Battle of Messines. 55th Division was then involved on the opening day of the Third Ypres Offensive (the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July). The divisional attack was to be in three stages, with 164th Bde passing through the leading brigades to take the third objective, the Gheluvelt‚ÄìLangemarck Line. When the 164th was ordered forward, the 1/4th Loyals and 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers leading, the enemy was still holding part of the second objective and casualties were heavy before the third objective was reached about 11.40. Although the Loyals captured all their objectives, including five batteries of 7.7 cm field guns, the Germans counter-attacked at 14.35 once the protective artillery barrage had ended and before the line could be consolidated. The brigade was forced to fall back to the second objective. Casualties among 1/4th Loyals had been heavy: 51 all ranks killed or died of wounds, 192 wounded and 71 missing. Of 22 officers who went into action only four were uninjured. The division was withdrawn for rest and retraining at St Omer.Wylly, pp. 172‚Äì75.Coop, pp. 46‚Äì53. Menin Road 55th Division returned to the line for the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, starting on 20 September). The objective was essentially the same as the third objective of 31 July. The creeping barrage began at 05.45 with 164th Bde as the front right brigade. 1/4th Loyals followed 1/4th King's Own, who were slightly held up by the counter-barrage, so that they Loyals caught up with them and were engaged earlier than anticipated. The battalion suffered heavy casualties from a strongpoint at Aisne Farm that the King's Own had bypassed, and then got involved in clearing Gallipoli Farm. The two battalions were now too weak to push on from the intermediate objective, and the supporting battalion (1/5th King's Own) was brought up to deal with counter- attacks, but overall the division's attack had been a success. 1/4th Loyals' losses amounted to 31 killed, 176 wounded and 11 missing.Wylly, p. 176.Coop, pp. 57, 60‚Äì64. Cambrai The division now moved south to recuperate in the Somme sector, but on 18 November the 1/4th Loyals were near Guillemont Farm when the enemy opened a hurricane bombardment and attacked. The advanced posts were overrun and the enemy got into the battalion's lines before being driven out, the Loyals' casualties amounting to 80. The battalion was not involved in the brigade's attack on Guillemont farm on 20 September, which was a diversion to assist the British attack at Cambrai.Wylly, pp. 177‚Äì78. On 28 November there were indications that the enemy intended to attack newly-won ground at Cambrai, and the 1/4th Loyals were brought up from reserve to Vaucellette Farm to be ready to counter-attack and ensure that the Villers Ghislain Spur was held. The German attack came on 30 November and made rapid progress. 1/5th Loyals made a stand and suffered heavy casualties, but an immediate counter-attack by 1/4th Loyals coming from reserve saved the situation. Villers Ghislain was retaken, but German pressure all along the line was intense, and eventually the battalion fell back and dug in at Vaucellette Farm. The battalion received praise from the Corps commander downwards for its actions. By the time it was relieved on 1 December the battalion had suffered 14 killed (including the CO, Lt-Col Hindle), 92 wounded and 15 missing.Wylly, pp. 178‚Äì80.Coop, pp. 65‚Äì78. Estaires Troops of 55th (West Lancashire) Division blinded by gas during the Battle of Estaires, 10 April 1918. The German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918. In its early weeks the 55th Division was not directly engaged but 164th Bde as divisional reserve was constantly moved from place to place in case of attacks. When the second phase of the German offensive began on 9 April (the Battle of Estaires) the brigade was holding the line from the La Bass√©e Canal to north of Givenchy, with 1/4th Loyals on the left. The attack was helped by morning mist and the Germans penetrated the front line. Soon the strongpoints at Moat Farm and Givenchy Church were surrounded, and some Germans even entered battalion HQ, but the situation was quickly restored. The lost ground was recaptured and by nightfall the battalion was back in all its original positions. This was the case throughout the 55th Division's front, despite a German breakthrough to its left. The battalion's losses were 44 killed, 104 wounded and 52 missing.Wylly, pp. 181‚Äì83.Coop, pp. 90‚Äì94.Blaxland, p. 119. After a short rest, 55th Division was back in the Givenchy defences by late April. On 14 May, A Company of 1/4th Loyals raided a German trench known as Willow Drain, but suffered serious casualties from a counter-attack. The sector remained static, though with frequent bombardments and raids, until September. The battalion was not engaged in 164th Bde's surprise attack on the Capture of Givenchy Craters on 24 August, and only provided carrying parties when the division captured Canteleux Trench (17 September).Wylly, pp. 183‚Äì84.Coop, pp. 124‚Äì25, 131‚Äì32. The Hundred Days Ruins of La Bass√©e after its capture, October 1918. By the end of September the Allied successes elsewhere in the Hundred Days Offensive meant that the Germans were preparing to retreat from in front of 55th Division. On 30 September two companies of 1/4th Loyals attacked strongpoints south of the La Bass√©e Canal. At first the attack was successful, but the neighbouring division failed, and a powerful counter-attack threw the Loyals back to their starting point. The battalion repeated the attack next day, and this time held all the objectives.Wylly, pp. 184‚Äì85.Coop, pp. 135‚Äì36. On 2 October the Germans began to retire and 55th Division pressed forward and occupied La Bass√©e the same day. It then participated in the pursuit to the Haute Deule Canal.Coop. p. 139 On 16 October, D Company and half of B Company of 1/4th Loyals crossed the Haute Deule Canal and advanced to attack a strongly-held bridgehead supported by A and C Companies. Having taken the bridgehead the battalion pushed patrols forward to the Seclin Canal. Once this had been bridge, other troops continued the pursuit. On 19 October the battalion took up the pursuit again, seizing four villages.Coop, p. 143. The pursuit was not easy: on 21 October the division pushed forward against considerable opposition to a position overlooking Tournai.Edmonds, 1918, Vol V, p. 419.Coop, p. 147. The following day the 1/4th Loyals, after a bombardment, seized a small wood at the western end of the Faubourg St Martin suburb. The battalion was driven out at 02.00 on 23 October, re-took the wood, and was then driven out again by shelling and gas.Edmonds, 1918, Vol V, p. 421.Coop. p. 148. On 30 October the battalion was withdrawn for rest and did not advance again until 9 November. It was at Villars St Armand, some miles in the rear on 11 November when the Armistice with Germany came into force at 11.00. 55th Division had advanced 50 miles in 80 days. From 9 October to 11 November, 1/4th Loyals lost 19 killed, 77 wounded and 46 missing. After the armistice the division was chiefly engaged on railway reconstruction and road repair in the Leuze-en-Hainaut area. In mid-December it moved to Brussels and began educational work to prepare the men for demobilisation. The battalions began to dwindle in January 1919 as men went home, and the last cadres left in April. The 1/4th Loyals was disembodied on 13 June 1919. Commanding officers The following commanded the 1/4th Bn during the First World War:Coop, p. 15. * Lt-Col R. Hindle, DSO (killed 30 November 1917) * Lt-Col J.A. Crump, DSO * Lt-Col T.C. Williams, DSO, MC =2/4th Loyals= The battalion was formed at Preston in October 1914 and was assigned to the 2/1st North Lancashire Bde in the 2nd West Lancashire Division, which were designated 170th Bde and 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division respectively in August 1915. A serious shortage of equipment hampered the training of the 2nd Line TF units and the only weapons available were .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles.57 Division at Long, Long Trail.57 Division at Regimental Warpath.Wylly, p. 187. In September 1915 the 57th Division assembled round Canterbury in Kent, with the 2/4th Loyals at Ashford. Serious training could now begin, and Lee-Enfield service rifles were issued in November (though these were not in good condition). Lewis guns arrived towards the end of February 1916. In July the division was moved to Aldershot Command and the 2/4th Loyals went to Blackdown Camp. In the line In January 1917 the division was deemed fit for service and crossed to France, the 2/4th Loyals landing at Le Havre on 8 February 1917. The division joined II ANZAC Corps and the battalion was introduced to trench warfare at Sailly-sur-la-Lys by 1st Bn New Zealand Rifle Brigade. It took over its sector of the front line on 17 February. The sector was considered a quiet one, but twice during March the battalion drove off German raids, and also suffered casualties in its own attempts at trench raids, as well as from sickness.Wylly, pp. 188‚Äì90. In May, the 2/4th and 2/5th Loyals were detached from 57th Division to hold a section of line anchored on the River Lys under 3rd Australian Division. Here they were heavily shelled throughout the 10-day detachment. D Company 2/4th Loyals carried out a large and successful trench raid on the night of 28/29 July.Wylly, pp. 190‚Äì92. Passchendaele In mid-September 57th Division was withdrawn from the line and underwent a month's training before moving to the Ypres Salient to participate in the Second Battle of Passchendaele. At 05.40 on 26 October 170th Bde attacked through appalling mud with three companies of 2/4th Loyals in the centre. The Mendling and Rubens Farm positions were quickly taken with relatively few casualties, but the centre of the attack was then held up by enemy pillboxes. Once the support battalion (2/5th King's Own) came up, the Loyals took the pillboxes and reached some dominating ground ahead. Further advance was impossible because of enemy machine guns over the rise, but the battalion held its ground until relieved that night. In its first major action it had suffered 61 killed or died of wounds, 259 wounded and 38 missing.Wylly, pp. 192‚Äì93. Scarpe By January 1918 the battalion was very weak in numbers, but it was brought up to strength in February. The division remained in quiet sectors during the German Spring Offensive until in late August it moved to the Arras sector to take part in the Battle of the Scarpe. The battalion attacked at 13.00 on 29 August, and took its first objective, the Hendecourt‚ÄìBullecourt road, without an artillery barrage and with its left flank unprotected, and then moved on to Greyhound Trench. It had taken all its objectives by 14.00 and held off a German counter-attack that night, though later had to withdraw a little because the battalion to its right fell back. The battalion was then in support until mid-September.Wylly, pp. 193‚Äì95. Canal du Nord On 27 September the 57th Division forced the line of the Canal du Nord. 170th Brigade's attack was led by the 1/5th Bn Loyals, with two companies of 2/4th Loyals in support for mopping-up and then defending the captured ground. Over the next four days of continuous fighting, the battalion's four companies were split up, assisting any unit in need to fill gaps, fight off counter-attacks, and consolidate ground won. On the afternoon of 1 October, A Company took part in a minor operation with 2/5th Bn to take 'Z' Trench, but failure by a neighbouring unit left A Company isolated. On the night of 2 October a man of A Company swam back across the St. Quentin Canal to report that the company was still holding out but the enemy were behind Z Trench. Attempts to get in touch with the company failed, and on the afternoon of 3 October B and D Companies attempted an attack covered by trench mortars, but only made 300 yards and were halted by machine gun fire with heavy casualties. On 4 October the survivors of A Company made it back to regain touch with the battalion.Wylly, pp. 195‚Äì98. The battalion was withdrawn for rest until 21 October, when it rejoined the 57th Division. The division was now advancing quickly. On 22 October, strong patrols of the 2/4th Loyals and 2/5th King's Own got across the Scheldt by rafts and a barrel-pier bridge at Pont √† Chin at Froyennes, but although reinforced by a Loyals company, the ground was too muddy to dig in, so the troops returned to the west bank.Wylly, p. 199. On 1 November the division handed over its part of the line and went into rest billets in Lille. It was still resting when the Armistice brought hostilities to a close. It was assigned to clearing and evacuating stores in the Arras area, where demobilisation began in January 1919. On 1 April the battalion was reduced to a cadre and this group sailed for home on 6 June. It was disbanded at Fovant on 14 June. Commanding Officer On landing in France in January 1917 the battalion was commanded by Lt-Col the Hon Robert Lygon, MVO (son of Frederick Lygon, 6th Earl Beauchamp), of the Grenadier Guards.Wylly, p. 188.Burke's. =3/4th Loyals= This battalion was formed at Preston on 10 May 1915 from a nucleus provided by the 2/4th Bn and assembled on 1 June 1915 at Weeton Camp, near Kirkham, Lancashire. Recruits were received from HQ at Avenham Lane, Preston, for training, together with men of the service battalions returning from hospital. The 3/4th Bn sent its first draft to the Western Front in September 1915. At the end of the year the battalion moved into winter billets in the Blackpool area, then in early 1916 it moved into huts at Park Hall Camp at Oswestry, where all the 3rd Line units of the West Lancashire Division were concentrated.Wylly, p. 200. It became the 4th Reserve Bn on 8 April 1916 and absorbed the 5th and 12th Reserve Bns of the Loyals on 1 September 1916. It formed part of the West Lancashire Reserve Brigade, training drafts until the end of the war. In April 1918 it moved to Dublin, Ireland, at first under canvas in Phoenix Park, later in Wellington Barracks, until it was disbanded on 5 July 1919.Wylly, p. 201.TF Training Bns at Regimental Warpath. =14th Loyals= The men of the TF who had not signed up for overseas service were separated from their units in 1915 and formed into Provisional Battalions for coast defence. The home service men of the 4th, 5th, and 12th Loyals formed the 42nd Provisional Battalion at Herne Bay, Kent, on 1 September 1915 and joined 9th Provisional Brigade, later in 218th Brigade in 73rd Division at Witham in Essex.Frederick, p. 184.Army Council Instruction 221 of January 1916 (Appendix 18).9th Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5458.42nd Provisional Battalion War Diary, TNA file WO 95/5458. The Home Service men continued in home defence until 1916, when the Military Service Act swept away the Home/Overseas service distinction and the provisional battalions took on the dual role of home defence and physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. The 42nd Provisional Battalion officially became the 14th Bn Loyals (TF) at Broadstairs on 1 January 1917. The battalion never served overseas, and as the men were drafted away it was disbanded on 15 December 1917 at Witham.Frederick, p. 146.Army Council Instruction 2364 of December 1916 (Appendix 204).David Porter's work on Provisional Brigades at Great War ForumBecke, Pt 2b, pp. 111‚Äì16 Interwar The TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 and the 4th Bn was reformed at Preston. 55th (West Lancashire) Division began to reform in April 1920 as part of Western Command. The 4th Loyals were once again in 164th (North Lancashire) Brigade. The TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921.Titles & Designations 1927. In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into searchlight (S/L) regiments.Routledge, p. 59. The 4th Loyals was one unit selected for this role, becoming 62nd (4th Bn The Loyal (North Lancashire) Regiment) Searchlight Regiment in 1938.Frederick, pp. 860‚Äì2, 871.Litchfield, p. 134.John Downham, 'The Regiments in World War II' at Lancashire Infantry Museum. It consisted of HQ and three S/L batteries (435, 436 and 437) at The Drill Hall, Stanley Street in Preston, and was attached to the Royal Artillery while remaining part of the Loyals. The regiment was assigned to 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Brigade of 4th AA Division. This brigade was responsible for the air defence of Liverpool and West Lancashire.4 AA Division 1939 at British Military History. AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.62 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45. Second World War =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì63. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti- Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì66, 371. 62nd (4th Loyals) Searchlight Rgt mobilised in 33 AA Bde of 4th AA Division,Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. but soon afterwards transferred to the newly formed 53rd Light AA Bde, which controlled all the S/L units in 4th AA Division.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. On 1 August 1940 all the infantry battalions converted into AA units formally became part of the Royal Artillery. 62nd S/L Rgt sent a cadre of experienced officers and men to 237th S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, County Down, where they were to form a new 566 S/L Bty on 17 April 1941, but this was cancelled. =The Blitz= During The Blitz from autumn 1940 to May 1941 the North-Western cities of Manchester and Liverpool were badly bombed and the North Midlands cities of Nottingham and Derby were also attacked. 62nd Searchlight Regiment was on duty in 53rd Light AA Bde throughout this period.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. In 1941 the searchlight layout over the Midlands was reorganised, so that any hostile raid approaching the Gun Defended Areas (GDA) around the cities must cross more than one searchlight belt, and then within the GDAs the concentration of lights was increased.Routledge, p. 399. The regiment stayed with 53rd Light AA Bde until after AA Command was reorganised in the autumn of 1942, when 4th AA Division was replaced by 4 AA Group. 62nd Searchlight Rgt moved to 50th AA Bde (covering Nottingham and Derby) in December 1942.Routledge, pp. 400‚Äì01, Map 36.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.

Regimental HQ, 435 and 436 SL Btys converted at Downpatrick, Northern Ireland (the batteries becoming 504 and 505 LAA Btys), while 437 S/L Bty was converted into 506 LAA Bty at Deepcut Barracks.Frederick, p. 807, 843.150 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.Farndale, Annex M.

On 2 March 1944 the 150th became the divisional LAA regiment for 9th Armoured Division, but the division never went overseas and was disbanded at the end of July 1944. The regiment transferred to 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, but that too remained in the UK throughout the war. Between 1 September and 28 November 1944 504 and 505 LAA Btys were acting independently. On 24 February 1945 the regiment left the UK and rejoined 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe.Joslen, pp. 23, 90, 463. It ended the war serving in 50th AA Bde in the defence of Antwerp against V-1 flying bombs ('Divers').Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. The regiment was ordered into suspended animation in British Army of the Rhine on 4 February 1946, completing the process by 22 February. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed at Preston as 597 (The Loyal) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, RA, forming part of Preston-based 93 (AA) Army Group Royal Artillery.Frederick, p. 1025.592‚Äì638 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson TA 1947. On 1 September 1950 the regiment was absorbed into 337 (2nd West Lancashire) Heavy AA Regiment, RA, forming R (Loyal) Bty.
