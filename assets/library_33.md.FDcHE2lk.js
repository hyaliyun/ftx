It connects the towns of Pineville, Matthews and Mint Hill. Route description Though NC 51 begins at the state line, SC 51 is a short road that connects with US 21, near Fort Mill, South Carolina. Crossing the state line, NC 51 quickly becomes a four- lane road as it goes through the town of Pineville. After its first intersection with I-485, it enters the Charlotte city limits. In Charlotte, NC 51 crosses the busy intersections of Johnston Road and Providence Road, known for rush-hour traffic during the weekdays. In Matthews, NC 51 bypasses the main downtown area, followed by a semi-controlled interchanged with US 74 (Independence Boulevard). As the NC 51 enters Mint Hill, the road narrows to two-lane. NC 51 crosses intersects I-485 again, before ending at NC 24/NC 27 (Albemarle Road). History The first NC 51 was an original state highway that traveled from NC 20, in Rockingham, to NC 74, in Wadeville. In 1928, Rockingham to Ellerbe became an extension of NC 75. In 1934, NC 51 was decommissioned in favor of NC 73, between Ellerbe and Mount Gilead, and NC 109, between Mount Gilead and Wadeville. The second and current NC 51 was established in 1934 as a renumbering of NC 276, between US 21/US 521, in Pineville, to NC 27, near Allen. In 1968, NC 51 was extended to the South Carolina state line, replacing a segment of US 21. In 1981, NC 51 was placed on new alignment in Pineville, abandoning an old routing along Lee Street and eliminating a short concurrency with US 521. In 1995, NC 51 was placed on new bypass north of downtown Matthews, marked as Matthews Township Parkway. The old alignment along Matthews-Mint Hill Road was downgraded to secondary road. =North Carolina Highway 276= North Carolina Highway 276 (NC 276) appeared in 1930 as new primary routing from NC 26, in Pineville, to NC 27, near Allen.

In operator theory, he is best known for his work in the 1980s on the invariant subspace problem, where he constructed operators with only trivial invariant subspaces on particular Banach spaces, especially on ell_1. He won the 1985 Junior Berwick Prize for his work on the invariant subspace problem. Read has also published on Banach algebras and hypercyclicity; in particular, he constructed the first example of an amenable, commutative, radical Banach algebra. At the time of his death, Read was a Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds after having been a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge for several years. He completed his PhD thesis entitled Some Problems in the Geometry of Banach Spaces at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of B√©la Bollob√°s. He died in Winnipeg in August 2015 while on a research visit at the University of Manitoba. Personal life =Christianity= On his personal website, formerly at the University of Leeds, Read described himself first and foremost as a Born-Again Christian. Some biographical details may be found in what he described as his Christian Testimony on that site describing his conversion process. He described losing his father to cancer in 1970 when he was 11 years old, and that this loss prompted him to ask questions about whether, and in what form, we might continue to live after we die- and that consciousness may be independent of the body. He came to the conclusion that the conscious mind must survive after death. This also led him to believe that since we are \\"immortal beings\\" that we must always try to \\"do the right thing\\". Some time later the article described an incident where he had pushed a smaller boy out of the way in a queue at a sweet shop. He later interpreted his later sense of remorse at having done something wrong as the \\"Classical Christian conviction of sin\\", and claimed to have had a religious experience on a London Underground train where he felt a sense of joy at being forgiven, and simultaneously bursting into tears. Read also claimed to have taken part in a miracle of Christian healing at a Christian meeting run by John Wimber, organiser of the Vineyard Movement.  Controversy over Read's Christian Testimony  An article in The Gryphon, the Leeds University Student Union newspaper in February 2015 stated that Read had \\"sparked controversy\\" by stating that at the end of his testimony: \\"‚ÄòI strongly urge you to seek the truth as a researcher, not trusting anyone else to do your basic investigations for you. That‚Äôs right, Jesus is the Way. But you have to find that out for yourself. For those who seek find, but those who can‚Äôt be bothered, or who think they‚Äôre too cool, end in a very dark place. It won't be cool in Hell.‚Äô\\" The article was prompted by a third-year Maths student who had expressed the opinion to the paper that the university website should not be giving details of personal beliefs as they were nothing to do with the ability to learn maths. Read subsequently displayed on his website a scanned image of the original article, under which a handwritten comment notes that \\"Leeds Gryphon, 13-2-15 notices Christian Testimony of CJR after several years!\\"http:// solocavediver.com /testimony2.jpg = Cave diving = Read was also a devotee of solo cave diving and wrote extensively about it on his website. He remained single in his life; he is survived by his mother and sister. He won a scholarship in mathematics to Trinity in October 1975 and was awarded a 1st class degree in Mathematics in 1978. He spent the year 1981-82 at Louisiana State.Leed(2015) Professor Charles John Reed Obituary http://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/obituaries/2015/read_charles.html References External links *Charles Read's Homepage *Charles Read at the Mathematics Genealogy Project Functional analysts Operator theorists 1958 births 2015 deaths British Christians 20th-century British mathematicians 21st-century British mathematicians Mathematical analysts Academics of the University of Leeds Alumni of the University of Cambridge ","title":"Charles Read (mathematician)"},{"id":"4295614","text":"Lucebert (;This was the pronunciation the poet himself used. Lubertus Jacobus Swaanswijk; 15 September 1924 ‚Äì 10 May 1994) was a Dutch artist who first became known as the poet of the COBRA movement. He was born in Amsterdam in 1924. He entered the Institute for Arts and Crafts in 1938 and took part in the first exhibition of the COBRA group at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in 1949. Biography Lucebert's talent was discovered when he started working for his father after school. After half a year of art school, he chose to be homeless between 1938 and 1947. In 1947, a Franciscan convent offered him a roof over his head, in exchange for a huge mural painting. Because the nuns could not appreciate his work, they had it entirely painted over with white paint. He belonged to the Dutch literary movement of De Vijftigers, which was greatly influenced by the European avant-garde movement COBRA. Lucebert's early work especially shows this influence, and his art in general reflects a rather pessimistic outlook on life. His strong personality appealed to many. As a poet he laid foundation for revolutionary innovation in Dutch poetry. Most of his poems were collected in Gedichten 1948‚Äì1965. After this period of composing poetry, he worked primarily in the visual arts known as figurative- expressionist from the 1960s. His work is being translated to english on collected works. Lucebert's sentence \\"\\" (\\"All things of value are helpless\\") on a building in Rotterdam Well known is his line \\"\\" from the poem ' (\\"The very old one sings\\"). The adjective \\"weerloos\\" means \\"defenseless\\", \\"unable to defend oneself\\", so the meaning is \\"All things of value are defenseless\\". This line was put on top of the office building of an insurance company in Rotterdam (near the Blaak station) in neon letters, including his name, sometime in the 1980s or earlier. It wasn't the first but is certainly the most prominent commercial use of the line; today three more buildings in the area display it on their walls. Similarly, written on the city's central library just across the street is \\" ‚Äì Erasmus\\", \\"All the world is my fatherland ‚Äì Erasmus\\". Lucebert died on 10 May 1994 in Alkmaar, Netherlands. Lucebert was also a noted anti-apartheid activist.

They represent the largest Berber-speaking population of Algeria and the second largest in North Africa. Many of the Kabyle have emigrated from Algeria, influenced by factors such as the Algerian Civil War, cultural repression by the central Algerian government,http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a585705.pdf and overall industrial decline. Their diaspora has resulted in Kabyle people living in numerous countries. Large populations of Kabyle people settled in France and, to a lesser extent, Canada and United States. The Kabyle people speak Kabyle, a Berber language. Since the Berber Spring of 1980, they have been at the forefront of the fight for the official recognition of Berber languages in Algeria.  History  Martinus R√∏rbye: A seated Kabyle. The Kabyle were relatively independent of outside control during the period of Ottoman Empire rule in North Africa. They lived primarily in three different kingdoms: the Kingdom of Kuku, the Kingdom of Ait Abbas, and the principality of A√Øt Jubar.E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Volume 4, publi√© par M. Th. Houtsma, Page: 600 The area was gradually taken over by the French during their colonization beginning in 1857, despite vigorous resistance. Such leaders as Lalla Fatma n Soumer continued the resistance as late as Mokrani's rebellion in 1871. Lalla Fatma N'Soumer of Tariqa led the resistance against French colonization 1851‚Äì57. French officials confiscated much land from the more recalcitrant tribes and granted it to colonists, who became known as pieds-noirs. During this period, the French carried out many arrests and deported resisters, mainly to New Caledonia (see: \\"Algerians of the Pacific\\"). Due to French colonization, many Kabyle emigrated into other areas inside and outside Algeria.B√©la√Ød Abane, L'Alg√©rie en guerre: Abane Ramdane et les fusils de la r√©bellion, p. 74 Over time, immigrant workers also went to France. In the 1920s, Algerian immigrant workers in France organized the first party promoting independence. Messali Hadj, Imache Amar, Si Djilani, and Belkacem Radjef rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II. Since Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In July 1962, the FLN (National Liberation Front) was split rather than united. Indeed, many actors who contributed to independence wanted a share of power but the ALN (National Liberation Army) directed by Houari Boumediene joined by Ahmed Ben Bella seemed to had the upper hand because of their military forces. In 1963 the FFS party of Hocine A√Øt Ahmed contested the authority of the FLN, which had promoted itself as the only party in the nation. A√Øt Ahmed and others consider that the central government led by Ben Bella is authoritarian and on September the 3rd 1963 the FFS (Socialist Forces front) was created by Hocine A√Øt Ahmed. This party regrouped people against the regime in place and a few days after its proclamation, Ben Bella sent the army into Kabylie to repress the insurrection. Colonel Mohand Ouelhadj had also taken part in the FFS and in the maquis because he considered that the moujahidin were not treated as they should be. At the beginning, the FFS wanted to negotiate with the government but since no agreement was reached, the maquis took up arms and its representatives swore not to give them up as long as democratic principles and justice were a part of the system. But after Mohand Ouelhadj's defection, A√Øt Ahmed could barely sustain the movement and after the FLN congress on April 16, 1964 which reinforced the government's legitimacy, he was arrested in October 1964. As a consequence, the insurrection was a failure in 1965 because it was hugely repressed by the forces of the ALN directed by Houari Boumediene. In 1965 A√Øt Ahmed was sentenced to death, but was later pardoned by Ben Bella. Approximately 400 deaths were counted amongst the maquis. In 1980, protesters mounted several months of demonstrations in Kabylie demanding the recognition of Berber as an official language; this period has been called the Berber Spring. In 1994‚Äì1995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the \\"strike of the school bag\\". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer Matoub Lounes and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields. In the months following April 2001 (called the Black Spring), major riots among the Kabyle took place following the killing of Masinissa Guermah, a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the Arouch, and neo- traditional local councils. The protests gradually decreased after the Kabyle won some concessions from President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. On 6 January 2016, Tamazight was officially recognized in Algeria's constitution as a language that was equal to Arabic.  Geography  Regions of Kabyle settlements in Algeria The geography of the Kabyle region played an important role in the people's history. The difficult mountainous landscape of the Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences. The area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Beja√Øa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus). During the spread of Islam, Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called el aadua : enemy by the Kabyle). The Regency of Algiers, under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout). The French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. The Djurdjura chain Topographic map of Kabylia. Algerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include Tizi Ouzou, B√©ja√Øa and Bouira, where they are a majority, as well as Boumerdes, Setif, Bordj Bou Arreridj, and Jijel. Algiers also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population. The Kabyle region is referred to as Al Qabayel (\\"tribes\\") by the Arabic-speaking population and as Kabylie in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it Tamurt Idurar (\\"Land of Mountains\\") or Tamurt n Iqbayliyen/Tamurt n Iqbayliyen (\\"Land of the Kabyle\\"). It is part of the Atlas Mountains and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.  Culture and society  = Language = The Kabyle ethnic group speak Kabyle, a Berber language of the Afro-Asiatic family. As second and third languages, many people speak Algerian Arabic, French and, to a lesser degree, English. During the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the Tifinagh writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the Latin script. It is the basis for the modern Berber Latin alphabet. After the independence of Algeria, some Kabyle activists tried to revive the Old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called Neo-Tifinagh, but its use remains limited to logos. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script. = Religion = The Kabyle people are mainly Muslim, with a small Christian minority.Abdelmadjid Hannoum, Violent Modernity: France in Algeria, Page 124, 2010, Harvard Center for Middle Eastern studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Amar Boulifa, Le Djurdjura √† travers l'histoire depuis l'Antiquit√© jusqu'en 1830 : organisation et ind√©pendance des Zouaoua (Grande Kabylie), Page 197, 1925, Algiers. Many Zawaya exist all over the region; the Rahmaniyya is the most prolific. Catholics of Kabyle background generally live in France. Recently, the Protestant community has had significant growth, particularly among Evangelical denominations.Lucien Oulahbib, Le monde arabe existe-t-il ?, page 12, 2005, Editions de Paris, Paris.  Economy  The traditional economy of the area is based on arboriculture (orchards and olive trees) and on the craft industry (tapestry or pottery). Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.  Politics  Demonstration by Kabyles in Paris in April 2016 The Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (Amazigh) identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation (Berberists); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as \\"Algerianists\\", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as Kabylists). * Two political parties dominate in Kabylie and have their principal support base there: the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), led by Ali Laskri who replaced Hocine A√Øt Ahmed,https://www.euronews.com/2012/05/12/election-hit-by-irregularities-says- algerian-opposition-leader, Euronews, \\"Election hit by irregularities, says Algerian opposition leader\\", www.euronews.com, 12 May 2012, accessed 5 October 2020 and the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), led by Mohcine Belabb√®s who replaced Sa√Ød Sadi.https://www.algeriepatriotique.com/2020/09/29/mohcine- belabbes-si-le-tribunal-me-convoque-je-repondrai-present/, Mounir Serra√Ø, \\"Mohcine Belabb√®s : ¬´Si le tribunal me convoque, je r√©pondrai pr√©sent¬ª\\", www.algeriepatriotique.com, 29 September 2020, accessed 5 October 2020 Both parties are secularist, Berberist and Algerianist. * The Arouch emerged during the Black Spring of 2001 as a revival of the village assembly, a traditional Kabyle form of democratic organization. The Arouch share roughly the same political views as the FFS and the RCD. * The MAK (Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie) also emerged during the Black Spring, It claimed the right for a regional autonomy of Kabylie. On 21 April 2010, MAK proclaimed a Provisional Government of Kabylie in exile (ANAVAD). Ferhat Mehenni was elected president by the National Council of the MAK.www. kabylia-gov.org, Kabylia Government website In 2013, MAK officially became an independantist movement and changed its name to The Mouvement for the Self-determination of Kabylie.  Diaspora  For historical and economic reasons, many Kabyles have emigrated to France, both for work and to escape political persecution.

Having a distinct nutty aroma and taste, the oil pressed from the toasted perilla seeds is used as a flavor enhancer, condiment, and cooking oil in Korean cuisine. The oil pressed from untoasted perilla seeds is used for non-culinary purposes.  Production  Perilla seeds Perilla oil is obtained by pressing the seeds of perilla, which contains 38-45% lipids.  Nutrition  Perilla oil is considered a rich source of fatty acids, and contains both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids in perilla oil are mainly palmitic (5-7%) and stearic (1-3%). Monounsaturated fatty acids in perilla oil are oleic (12-22%), while polyunsaturated fatty acids in perilla oil are linoleic (13-20%), gamma-linolenic (0-1%), alpha- linolenic (54-64%), and arachidic (0-1%). In comparison to other plant oils, perilla oil exhibits one of the highest proportion of omega-3 fatty acids, which is between 54-64%. The omega-6 fatty acid component is usually around 14%.  Use  = Culinary = Kkaennip-deulgireum-bokkeum (perilla leaves stir-fried in perilla oil) In Korean cuisine, perilla oil and sesame oil are the two chief oils used in flavoring, sauces, and dips. Usually made from toasted perilla seeds, the oil is used as a flavor enhancer, condiment, and cooking oil. Either sesame or perilla oil can be used for flavoring namul (vegetable side dishes) and other sides, pan-frying jeon (pan-fried dishes), coating gim (laver) before roasting it, and forming the flavor base for dipping sauce. Specifically, perilla oil is more common in the southern part of Korea as perilla is cultivated more easily in the warmer areas. Nowadays, perilla oil is used in Korean-style western food as well. A Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul serves nutty vanilla ice cream which has perilla oil as its \\"secret ingredient.\\" = Industrial = Perilla oil made from untoasted seeds can be used for non-culinary purposes, including in paint, varnish, printing ink and linoleum. As a drying oil similar to tung oil or linseed oil, perilla oil has been used for paints, varnishes, linoleum, printing ink, lacquers, and for protective waterproof coatings on cloth. Perilla oil can also be used for fuel. It is used along with synthetic resins in the production of varnishes. It dries faster than linseed oil and on drying forms a film that is harder and yellows more than that formed by linseed oil. The paint and varnish industry accounts for the largest usage. Perilla oil is also important in the manufacture of printing inks and linoleum, and in more ancient times was a critical component in creating durable earthen floors. In Japan, perilla oil was important for fueling oil lamps until early 16th century, before it was overtaken by rapeseed oil. The oilseed contains drying oil elements and was imported in bulk as a substitute for linseed oil into the United States from Japan, until the supply was interrupted by war. In Korea, perilla oil pressed from the untoasted seeds were used to fuel lamps and to oil floor papers. = Use of press cake = The press cake remaining after pressing perilla oil can be used as natural fertilizer or animal feed.

Graduating from Dartmouth College in 1885, he is known in part for penning the school Alma Mater, Men of Dartmouth. Biography Hovey was born in Normal, Illinois, the son of Major General Charles Edward Hovey and Harriet Spofford Hovey. He grew up in North Amherst, Massachusetts, and in Washington, D.C., before attending Dartmouth. His first volume of poems was privately published in 1880. He collaborated with Canadian poet Bliss Carman on three volumes of \\"tramp\\" verse: Songs from Vagabondia (1894), More Songs from Vagabondia (1896), and Last Songs from Vagabondia (1900), the last being published after Hovey's death. Hovey and Carman were members of the \\"Visionists\\" social circle along with F. Holland Day and Herbert Copeland, who published the \\"Vagabondia\\" series. Some twenty-nine poets have attempted to write sequels for Byron's Don Juan. Hovey was one of them. Samuel Chew praised Hovey's ‚ÄúCanto XVII‚Äù in his book To the End of the Trail. ‚ÄúThis is one of the most convincing reproductions of the spirit and movement of Byron's verse that I have ever come across. It is supposed to be written by Byron in Hades. The poet refuses to take up the poem at the point at which Death had cut him short.‚Äî Southey‚Äôs forgotten; so is Castlereagh; But there are fools and scoundrels still today. In the sequel we hear nothing of Juan; the satire is expended upon current affairs. Byron is full of curiosity as to events on earth: I‚Äôve such a next- day‚Äôs thirst for information, I‚Äôd even be content to read the Nation.Samuel C.

Without further chart entries, they remain one-hit wonders in the UK. They comprise two members: Michael Coleman and Kevin Parrott. Career The duo had originally been members of a Stax-style soul band called The Big Sound, working mainly in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, but also touring Israel in 1967. The Big Sound had previously backed singer Karol Keyes, now known as the actress Luan Peters. In Denmark, the band were the backing group to the Danish singer, Rock Nalle. The act Brian and Michael was originally called Burke and Jerk, a comedy duo composed of Brian Burke and Mick Coleman, formed in 1976, some nine years after Coleman had left The Big Sound. During the intervening years Parrott and Coleman had stayed friends, and Coleman had followed Parrott's recording career as lead guitarist with Manchester rock band Oscar, who were signed to DJM Records. When Coleman first wrote \\"Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs\\", he took the song to Parrott. The latter borrowed the estimated ¬£1,000 to produce the record which was recorded at Pluto Studios in Stockport, in the same building as Strawberry Studios. Pluto Studios was owned by the former Herman's Hermits rhythm guitar player Keith Hopwood. The song was recorded over three sessions starting on 25 September 1977. The brass band on the recording is Tintwistle Brass Band, from the village in Derbyshire where Parrott lived at the time. Parrott tried without success to get a release with several record labels, but eventually secured a recording contract with Pye Records. However, Brian Burke left the act just a couple of weeks after \\"Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs\\" was released on 25 November 1977, citing \\"family reasons\\". Parrott left Oscar after 10 years, and teamed up with Coleman again, in the live act to try to keep up the promotion of \\"Matchstalk Men\\", and had to be billed as 'Brian'. The first run of records had already been pressed as Brian and Michael before Burke had left the act. After their success, Brian and Michael released a follow-up single, \\"Evensong\\" (written by Phil Hampson), and an album, The Matchstalk Men, followed by a second album named I Can Count My Friends on One Hand. Backing singers St Winifred's School Choir released an unsuccessful album entitled The Matchstalk Children. Coleman and Parrott remain in the music industry as songwriters and record producers for themselves and other acts. Other chart success as writers/producers were with \\"The Sparrow\\" (The Ramblers, No 11 in 1979), and Claire and Friends' \\"It's 'Orrible Being in Love when You're Eight and a Half\\" (Number 13 in 1986). Coleman also wrote the hit song \\"Hold My Hand\\" for Ken Dodd. St Winifred's School Choir had their own number one hit with \\"There's No One Quite Like Grandma\\" during Christmas time in 1980. Recent times In an article in The Guardian newspaper, Parrott said \\"we started performing together again in 2002, and are incredibly moved by the reception we get. We did a reunion concert at Manchester's Lowry Centre with the original St Winifred's girls. In February 2012, Brian and Michael decided to form a new band and recruited their respective brothers, former Dooleys drummer Nigel Parrott, and Tim Coleman as lead vocalist. They also added a keyboard player ‚Äì The Dakotas keysman, Toni Baker, made several guest appearances ‚Äì and Ian Jenkins took over the role in 2014. In 'The Matchstalk Men', Coleman has returned to his bass playing roots, Parrott to his rock guitar style, and the band are performing songs from the two Brian and Michael albums, plus \\"many of the favourites we grew up with during our 1950s and 1960s formative years\\". 2015 celebrated 50 years for Kevin Parrott and Mick Coleman as musical colleagues. Following Tim Coleman's retirement from the band in 2016, the position of lead vocalist with 'The Matchstalk Men' was taken by Steve Pickering (aka comedian Dudley Doolittle), an old friend of Parrot and Coleman's who actually comp√®red a show at the London Palladium on the night, in 1978, that Brian and Michael topped the bill as 'number one' recording artists. Ian Jenkins retired from the business in 2017 and his place on keyboards was, once again, filled by Toni Baker. \\"Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs\\" \\"Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs\\" was a tribute to the artist L. S. Lowry, who had died two years previously. For the song, Coleman drew on his own memories of Salford and Ancoats as well as the paintings of Lowry. St Winifred's School Choir appeared on the record, singing the children's song \\"The Big Ship Sails on the Alley-Alley-O\\", which was sung by children in the Salford area with reference to the Manchester Ship Canal. The single spent three weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart. The b-side of the record was entitled \\"The Old Rocking Chair\\". Mick Coleman received the Ivor Novello award for 'The Outstanding Lyric of the Year'. The tune of the song has also been adapted by The Lancashire Hotpots in the song \\"Dolby 5.1\\".

An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him. In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase \\"nigger in the woodpile\\" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices.

He most prominently was a successful manager at Br√∏ndby IF, for whom he had also played in his active years. He helped turn the side into the most dominant Danish team in the 1990s, and he also managed the club in several European campaigns with regular successful UEFA Cup runs, and a UEFA Champions League qualification. He has won numerous Danish Superliga and Danish Cup titles. Career Skovdahl started playing as a child for Vanl√∏se IF. He played 130 amateur games for the club\\"60 √•r i dag: Han samler p√• pokaler\\", Politiken article, July 5, 2005 before he moved to Br√∏ndby IF in the Danish 3rd Division in 1971. Following 89 amateur matches, many of them as team captain, he went on to become Br√∏ndby's third team coach in 1977. He coached a few minor Danish teams Hvals√∏ IF and Glostrup IC before he secured two consecutiveFrits Ahlstr√∏m: Guinness Fodboldbog (1983), side 64-65 promotions for Br√∏nsh√∏j BK to the Danish 1st Division in 1982, the then best league of football in Denmark. In 1986, he moved back to coach Br√∏ndby, who had just won the Danish football championship in 1985. =Championship coach= Skovdahl went on to coach Br√∏ndby towards its second Danish championship in 1987 and he also guided the club to the quarterfinals of the 1986‚Äì87 European Cup international tournament. Following two years at Br√∏ndby, Skovdahl moved to Portugal before the conclusion of the Danish season to coach the defending Portuguese Liga champions Benfica. Birger Peitersen went on to finish his job at Br√∏ndby and secured the 1987 Danish championship. The job at Benfica was too much for the internationally inexperienced Skovdahl, and he lasted half a year in the club. He returned to coach Br√∏ndby in 1988 where he won his first Danish championship as well as the Danish Cup trophy, before Skovdahl had a short interlude at Vejle BK in the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Following the near- bankruptcy of Br√∏ndby IF in 1992, Skovdahl returned to the club once more. In his first year at Br√∏ndby, he coached a 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 system, and re-schooled former attacking players Jes H√∏gh and Ole Bjur to more defensive position, where they blossomed. Though Br√∏ndby did not win the Danish championship in his first year, Skovdahl was named 1992‚Äì93 Danish Manager of the Year, for rebuilding the Br√∏ndby team by re-schooling players to their best abilities.Sten Henriksen, \\"Skovdahls √•r\\", Politiken, 19 June 1993 He went on to install a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 system with hardworking players, whose constant pressure on the opponent, combined with the necessary technical and tactical skills, went on to dominate the Danish championship for half a decade. After a few seasons of stable play and secondary finishes in the domestic league, the big turn-around for the club came in the 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Cup when Liverpool F.C. was eliminated, and including that season, Br√∏ndby won three Danish championships in a row. The success of the team under Skovdahl concluded in qualification for the 1998‚Äì99 UEFA Champions League tournament, as the second Danish team (after AaB in 1995). In all, Skovdahl won four Danish championships and three Danish Cups and guided Br√∏ndby to a number of individual results in the European competitions. = Aberdeen = In 1999, he moved to become a popular manager of Scottish side Aberdeen F.C. in the top-flight Scottish Premier League (SPL) division. Aberdeen had been one of the most successful sides in Scotland in the eighties and early nineties, but the club started to decline from 1995. By 1999, heavy in debt and not capable of matching the Old Firm in the transfer market, the Dons needed to appoint a successful coach who could work with a small budget. So the club went for the fashionable idea of appointing a successful foreign coach, Ebbe Skovdahl. In Skovdahl's first season at Aberdeen, the club finished bottom of the 1999‚Äì2000 Scottish Premier League, but Aberdeen avoided a potential relegation play-off due to Falkirk not meeting the SPL stadium requirements. Despite overseeing one of the poorest sides in Aberdeen's recent history in his first season in charge, Skovdahl proved popular with the fans. In that first year he brought in many foreign signings, with mixed success, and among his signings were Arild Stavrum, Hicham Zerouali, and Roberto Bisconti. The one highlight of Skovdahl's first season was that Aberdeen reached both the 2000 Scottish League Cup Final and the 2000 Scottish Cup Final, but they lost both finals to Celtic and Rangers respectively. In the following season Aberdeen's fortunes improved domestically, but were knocked out of the 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Cup by Irish side Bohemians on the away goals rule. This was the first time that a Scottish club had been knocked out of European competition by Irish opposition. The next year Aberdeen improved dramatically as Skovdahl guided them to 4th place in the 2001‚Äì02 Scottish Premier League. Young players such as Kevin McNaughton, Russell Anderson, Philip McGuire, striker Darren Mackie, and goalkeeper Ryan Esson were developed. Yet with the Bosman ruling, and Aberdeen's substantial debt, which had built up before Skovdahl became manager, it became clear that the system Skovdahl had used with Br√∏ndby could not be maintained at Aberdeen. With many of the players he had developed on short term contract, and likely to leave at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, it became clear to Skovdahl that he could not in the long term achieve at Aberdeen what he had with Br√∏ndby. Aberdeen lost narrowly to Hertha Berlin in the 2002‚Äì03 UEFA Cup. The club had a poor domestic start to the 2002‚Äì03 campaign, prompting Skovdahl to announce his intention to resign. He was replaced by Steve Paterson in December 2002. =Danish return= He returned to Danish Superliga club BK Frem, who he tried to save from relegation, though without success. Following disputes with the club board over the long-term aims of the club, Skovdahl resigned in winter 2005.http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/generelle/ebbe-skovdahl-forlader-frem Personal life Skovdahl is the uncle of Danish international footballers Michael and Brian Laudrup.

It is funded by contributions from participating national radio networks. The first Rostrum took place in 1954 and involved delegates from the German, French, Belgian and Swiss national broadcasting companies. From then until 2002 the Rostrum's sessions were held at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, with the exception of 2000 when they were hosted by Muziek Groep Nederland and the Gaudeamus Foundation in Amsterdam. Since 2003, a rotation system has been in place, where the Rostrum is hosted every other year by Radio France and in the intervening year visits a European venue. Starting from 2010 the Rostrum is travelling around Europe by invitation of National Radio Broadcasters. Over thirty national radio networks now send delegates, presenting in total sixty or so works each year that have been composed no more than five years previously. Following sessions of listening and discussion, the delegates highlight one of the works submitted (that year's \\"selected work\\") and recommend a number of the others. They also highlight one or two works by composers under the age of thirty and recommend one or two others. These selected and recommended works are those most likely to be broadcast or played in concerts sponsored by the participating networks or others that follow the Rostrum's deliberations. All works presented are offered by the European Broadcasting Union to its members via satellite. Copies of recordings, scores and notes featured during the forum are kept at the Gaudeamus Foundation. From 1991 until 2003 the composer of each year‚Äôs selected work was awarded the UNESCO Mozart Medal. Since 2004 the composer of each year‚Äôs selected work is awarded the UNESCO Picasso-Mir√≥ Medal and the composer or composers under the age of thirty whose work or works are selected are awarded the Guy Huot Bursary for young composers.

Origins Born by 1508, he was the only son of George Guildford (died by 1537), of Hemsted, who was the second son of Sir Richard Guildford and his first wife Anne, daughter of John Pympe, of Nettlestead. His mother was Elizabeth, only daughter and heiress of Robert Mortimer (died 1485 at Bosworth), of Thorpe-le- Soken, and his wife Isabel, daughter of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. He had two sisters: Mary, who married Sir Owen West (died 1551), and Anne, who married first Walter Woodland and secondly Richard Lynne. Life In 1529, at an early age, he was elected MP for Gatton, a seat controlled by Sir Roger Copley, who was not only his stepmother's brother but also his wife's uncle.His stepmother Dorothy was a sister of Sir Roger, as was his wife's mother Eleanor. His own uncles, Sir Edward Guildford and Sir Henry Guildford, were the knights of the shire for Kent. He may have sat for Gatton in later Parliaments, but the records are lost. Once the parliamentary sessions were over, in 1530 he enrolled at Gray's Inn to study law. When his uncle Edward died in 1534 without leaving a written will, John claimed that by last wishes spoken at the deathbed he was heir to the manor of Halden and other lands in Kent and Sussex. As this was disputed by Edward's only surviving child Jane and her husband, then known as Sir John Dudley, in the end he was unable to secure the estates, though the episode had an aftermath many years later. In 1534 he was appointed bailiff of Winchelsea, holding the post for life, and about 1537 inherited his father's property. As a landowner, he was made a justice of the peace for Kent and in 1542 he was knighted, sitting that year in Parliament as knight of the shire for Kent and thereafter sitting on various commissions involving the county. By 1546 he had been named as chamberlain of the household of Anne of Cleves, the discarded wife of King Henry VIII, and on the death of the King had to negotiate with the Privy Council on her behalf. While he secured continuing payment for her staff, she was however required to vacate Bletchingley and move to Penshurst Place, where he was still looking after her interests in 1550. In 1552 he was chosen as High Sheriff of Kent and again came to the attention of John Dudley, now Duke of Northumberland and effective ruler of England while King Edward VI was still a minor. Dudley gave him the lease of some of the lands the two had disputed nearly twenty years earlier and in July 1553, two days before the sickly young king's death, ordered him to raise a company of 30 men. Three days after the king's death, he was required to send at least two gentlemen from Kent to join Dudley's force backing the claim to the throne of his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey. It seems Guildford was not compromised by the failed coup, being reappointed to the bench under Queen Mary I and in October 1553 he may have sat as MP for New Romney, the records being unclear. When Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558, he was removed from the commission of the peace and took no further part in public life. On 4 May 1560 he made his will, asking to be buried beside his first wife in the church of Benenden and leaving to his eldest son the mansion house and manor of Hemsted with its contents, including weapons and armour, while his younger sons had generous legacies and funds for their education. His executors were named as Sir Warham St Leger and the MP Sir John Mason. He died on 5 July 1565, with his will being proved six days later. Family Before 1534 he married Barbara (died by 1550), the daughter of Thomas West, 8th Baron de la Warr, and his third wife Eleanor, daughter of Sir Roger Copley.

It has an area of 1.39 km¬≤, which makes it the 11th largest island of the archipelago. With a population of 253 (census 2000), however, it ranks third, after Isla del Rey and Isla Taboga. A popular tourist destination, Contadora has a small regional/domestic airport (IATA code: OTD), and has regular flights to and from Panama City and the rest of the islands in the archipelago. History Contadora was the island where the Spanish counted the pearls that were harvested from the other islands in the archipelago, hence the name of the island, which means \\"the one that counts\\" in Spanish. The islands produced pearls of many colors and sizes, and during the many years when pearls were harvested from the waters around the islands, the natives would converge to Contadora to count their pearls and sell them to the Spaniards. Early last century there was an underwater epidemic which killed most of the pearl oysters, reducing the production of pearls to a dribble. In 1980, the exiled Iranian shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, briefly lived in Contadora.Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. 1980a. Answer to History. Briarcliff Manor, NY: Stein & Day. The Contadora Peace Accords, which laid the foundation for peace in Central America, were negotiated in this island during the 1980s. Hence the Contadora Group took their name from the island's name. thumb Tourism Contadora is a growing tourist destination known for its remote location and secluded beaches. There are two main hotels on the island, Villa Romanica and Perla Real (A large hotel named The Point still exists on the North Side of the island but this has since closed for business). However, most tourists tend to stay at the villas for rent at the northeast side of the island due to their privacy and access to a private beach. There are also several local restaurants that cater to all types of food. Restaurante Geraldo's offers Italian as well as Casa Tortuga; however, places such as the Restaurante Clarita offer more local Latin American cuisine.https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g298429-Contadora_Island_Pearl_Islands_Panama_Province.html The main boulevard on the northeast side of the island, next to the small stretch of runway for the incoming airplane, lay several tourist shops that offer local jewelry and souvenirs as well as boating, scuba diving, and snorkeling tours. The island has also hosted three showings of the TV show Survivor and many of the crew members and directors stayed on the island during filming.https://www.myguidepanama.com/things-to-do/contadora-island Geography Contador houses several beaches, including Playa Larga, Playa Gale√≥n, Playa Canoa, Playa Caracol, Playa Lucas, Playa Roca, Playa Camar√≥n, Playa Cacique, and Playa de las Suecas. All of the beaches house white sands and turquoise waters reminiscent of the Caribbean. Ample coral reefs litter the ocean and sea life such as clown fish, angel fish, butterfly fish, red snapper, mahi-mahi, parrot fish, stingrays, and nurse sharks. The island is devoid of mountains, though small hills make for relatively steep roads on the northeast side of the island. Due to that, tourists often choose to travel around the island via motorcycle, golf cart, or scooter. Contadora‚Äôs main water source comes from a small lake at the northwest of the island called el Largo.https://earth.google.com/web/@8.63084336,-79.03493296,16.91707424a,4974.72904495d,35y,0h,0t,0r Rainforest makes up most of the islands mass, and within everything from iguanas, to geckos, to monkeys, to snakes, to non-indigenous deer live. thumb Population The population of Contadora is a mere 115 people.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/panama/isla-contadora While most of the citizens there are native Panamanians, some are multimillionaires with summer homes. When Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was exiled from Iran he spent much of his fortune on property in Contadora. A government crackdown on tax evasion caused many of the rich to leave - some of the homes are now rented out to tourists. A small school is present on the island, where several children attend; however, most of the island life is centered around tourism, so most of the locals spend their time catering to such industries.

Fountain of Venere Ciprea. It is known for its castle from which its name derives, and around which the city developed in the 14th century. History Construction of the Castle began in 1316, by order of Count Francesco I of Ventimiglia, over the ruins of the ancient Byzantine town of Ypsigro, high on the San Pietro hill. Hence its original name, Castello del buon aere (\\"Castle of good air\\"), from which the name Castelbuono is derived - literally meaning \\"good castle\\". Numerous drastic alterations were made in the 17th century for reasons of accommodation, when a number of Ventimiglia families moved here from Palermo - the castle never served any really strategic purpose, owing to its geographic position down valley. The construction presents Arab-Norman and Swabian features: the cube shape recalls Arabic architecture; the square towers, although incorporated into those of the fa√ßade, reflect Norman architectural style, as also the battlements; and the round tower recalls aspects of Swabian architecture. The city is home to one of Europe's oldest road running competitions: the Giro Podistico Internazionale Castelbuono was first held in the city in 1912 and is held annually.Castellini, Ottavio (2007-07-24).

The structure is on three floors, the first floor for the servants, with the essential services, the second for the nobility, with the sumptuous Cappella Palatina, and the third for the court and for guests. The Cappella Palatina (\\"Palace Chapel\\") was built in 1683 by the brothers Giuseppe and Giacomo Serpotta, with a great profusion of precious marble, stuccowork, putti, and friezes that commemorate the most resplendent moments in the history of the House of Ventimiglia. Here is kept the holy relic of the skull of Saint Anne, in an urn that acts as the pedestal to the sculpted bust of Castelbuono's patron saint. There are also the traditional underground dungeons and a tunnel that leads to the Church of San Francesco. =Other sights= The church of Matrice Vecchia was built in the 15th century on the ruins of a pagan temple. It has a Renaissance portico added in the 16th century, and a central portal in the Catalan-Gothic style. On the left side is a bell-tower with a Romanesque mullioned window culminating in an octagonal spire covered with majolica tiles. The interior of the church, originally divided into a nave and two aisles, received another aisle at the end of the 16th century. It preserves prized works, most remarkably, above the main altar, a splendid polyptych depicting The Coronation of the Virgin , attributed to Pietro Ruzzolone or possibly Antonello de Saliba.

He was transferred to Spain's RCD Mallorca on 4 January 2006. His beginnings at his new club were promising, as he netted three times in his first five games - including a penalty kick equalizer against Real Madrid on 26 February, in an eventual 2-1 home triumph. However, Pisculichi gradually fell out of favour with the Balearic Islands outfit and, on 30 November 2006, was transferred to Al-Arabi Sports Club in Doha, Qatar for ‚Ç¨3.6 million, with the move being made effective in January of the following year. He played amazing football in his 5 years of football in Al Arabi.

However, he neglected to mention that he had previously represented the Argentina under-20 team, rendering him ineligible to play for the Qatar team without special permission from FIFA. However, the same scenario occurred in 2012. The Al-Arabi administration wanted to naturalize him so they could have an extra foreign player in their squad to participate in the AFC Champions League.

The two main sports played at the ground are cricket and rugby union. It is one of the largest cricket grounds in New Zealand. McLean Park is a sports ground of international standards which includes the main outdoor stadium and the indoor Rodney Green Centennial Events Centre. The home teams for this ground are the Hawke's Bay Rugby Union and Central Districts Cricket Association. The two ends of the stadium are named the Centennial Stand End and Embankment End. Its close proximity to the International Date Line makes it the world's easternmost Test match ground. Ground The ground was initially named 'Sir Donald McLean Park' by an act of Parliament after Sir Douglas McLean (also spelt Maclean) donated ten acres of land as a memorial to his father. In cricket, the ground is primarily a one-day venue with square dimensions that allow attacking batsman to score freely especially in the opening overs. There are four covered stands and a large grass bank opposite the Centennial Stand. The wicket tends to slow up throughout the day therefore captains prefer to set targets on this pitch. It has held first class matches since 1952 and ten tests since 1979. New Zealand's Test record at the ground is seven draws, one win and two losses. It has held at least a single one-day international every season since 1990. The ground has a capacity of 19,700 and the pitch is turf. Usage =Cricket= The ground is used for hosting all formats. The first ODI played here was between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Rothman's Cup of 1982/83. In this match New Zealand defeated Sri Lanka by 7 wickets. =Rugby Union= McLean Park is the home stadium of the Hawkes Bay Magpies in the Mitre 10 Cup. It has also hosted several New Zealand Maori games in the past. During the 1987 Rugby World Cup the stadium played host to the Pool 2 game between Canada and Tonga on 24 May 1987. At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, McLean Park was again chosen as a venue and hosted two games in Pool A, France vs. Canada on 18 September 2011 and Canada vs. Japan on 27 September 2011. To date the stadium has only hosted two All Blacks tests. The first was played on 7 June 1996, when the All Blacks beat Manu Samoa 51-10 on Samoa's tour of New Zealand. This test has the distinction of being the first home test in which the All Blacks played under floodlights. The second test featuring the All Blacks took place on 6 September 2014. This was a round 3 clash in the Rugby Championship between the All Blacks and Argentina. The All Blacks won 28-9. The stadium also serves as an alternative home venue for the Hurricanes franchise in Super Rugby. A total of 11 Super Rugby matches have been played at McLean Park, the first being on 15 March 1996, when the Hurricanes beat Transvaal by 32-16. In the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the Crusaders used the stadium as a home ground for two matches against the Chiefs in 2011 and 2012. =Rugby League= Melbourne Storm Rugby league played an NRL game against St. George-Illawarra Dragons at the stadium on 25 July 2015. Redevelopments Redevelopment of the park has recently finished and the new Graham Lowe Stand opened on Saturday 1 August 2009 when the Hawke's Bay Magpies opened their Air New Zealand Cup campaign with a win against Auckland. Redevelopments took just one year to complete. The stand was built for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and to a lesser extent the 2015 Cricket World Cup of which both events will have games at the venue. In 2018 in response to drainage issues preventing ODI matches from being played at McLean Park, the outfield was in the process of being resurfaced, however delays have forced 2 ODIs in January 2018 against Pakistan and against England in February 2018 to be moved. McLean Park made its international return with New Zealand playing India in January 2019. Statistics =Test matches= McLean Park is regarded as one of the most batting friendly wickets in the world.

It was announced on Nov. 12, 2008 that the college would close at the end of the 2008 fall semester due to a decline in enrollment and financial difficulty. The college held its final commencement on Nov. 22, 2008 and it is now closed. History In 1910, Dr. Iva Durham Vennard founded Chicago Evangelistic Institute (CEI) in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of providing \\"effective training for Christian service.\\" Her stated goals were to send Spirit-filled people into the ministry and to promote Scriptural Holiness. In 1951, the school moved to University Park, Iowa, where it was renamed Vennard College in 1959. The move to the beautiful, rural setting brought Vennard into a familial relationship with the graduates of the three other Christian colleges which formerly occupied the campus: Central Holiness University, John Fletcher College, and Kletzing College. Dr. Vennard's presidency was followed by the leadership of Dr. Harry E. Jessop. Presidents of Vennard College have included Dr. H. M. Couchenour, Dr. J. Sutherland Logan, Dr. Merne A. Harris, Dr. Warthen T. Israel, Dr. Burnis Bushong (interim president) and Dr. Blake J. Neff. In 1996, Vennard College was newly incorporated to continue the tradition of Christian higher education on this historic campus with Dr. W. Edward Rickman as president. In 2002, Dr. Bruce E. Moyer picked up the reigns of leadership, but unfortunately, the College was unable to remain open. Vennard College announced on November 12, 2008 that it would close at the end of the 2008 fall semester, according to the Des Moines Register. The academic records have been transferred to the University of Iowa, and the transcripts can be obtained from the Registrar's Office of the University of Iowa. Vennard College archives have been transferred to MidAmerican Nazarene University in Olathe, KS. Athletics Vennard's mascot was the Cougar and the official school colors were purple and white. Vennard College offered intercollegiate sports in men and women‚Äôs basketball, women‚Äôs volleyball and men‚Äôs soccer. Vennard College was a member of NCCAA Division II and the Midwest Christian College Conference. All teams were eligible for conference and post season tournaments. Individual players were eligible for All Conference, All Region and All American Teams. Recreation Vennard College boasted many opportunities to participate in a variety of intramural sports that included dodge ball and indoor soccer. The campus was home to a miniature golf course that was open to the public. The miniature golf course is still in operation and open to the public. References Further reading * Harris, Merne A.

He is co-chairman of the European Union Youth Orchestra from 2014. chairman, British Architecture Trust Board, RIBA, from 2014. From 1980 to 1986 he was a main presenter of BBC 2's Newsnight programme. From 1986 to 1993 he was managing director of the BBC World Service. From 1995 to 2007 he was managing director of the City of London's Barbican Arts Centre. Early life Born in Zl√≠n, Czechoslovakia,Bata (shoe) company history website which includes biographical paragraph on Tusa whose father was a senior Bata employee in March 1936, Tusa moved to England with his family in 1939. His father, also John Tusa (Jan T≈Ø≈°a), was managing director of British Bata Shoes, established by the Czechoslovak shoe company, which, following its international pattern, also created a pioneering work-living community around its factory in East Tilbury, Essex. Two days before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939, Tusa senior flew out of Czechoslovakia on a Bata company plane, via Poland, Yugoslavia and France. He then became general manager of the Bata factory and its associated village in East Tilbury, living in the nearby village of Horndon-on-the-Hill where his son grew up.Lecture by John Tusa Tusa junior was educated at St Faith's School, Cambridge, Gresham's School, Holt, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class degree in History. Career In 1960, he joined the BBC as a trainee. After presenting the BBC's 24 Hours and later Newsnight (from its inception in 1979), he became managing director of the BBC World Service from 1986 to 1993. Tusa was President of Wolfson College from January to October 1993. He was then a newsreader on BBC's One O'Clock News for two years during the mid-1990s. He anchored the BBC's coverage of the D-Day 50th anniversary celebrations in June 1995, and of the Hong Kong handover on 30 June 1997. From 1995 until 2007 he was managing director of the Barbican Arts Centre in the City of London. For several years, he was chairman of the board of the Wigmore Hall in London and was appointed chairman of the University of the Arts London in 2007. For many years he sat on the governing Council of Imperial College London, on the strength, was then offered vice-chancellor positions at Reading and then York University. But Tusa was first and foremost a journalist; he decided that he did not have the financial expertise. In 1987 he had been rejected for the position of Director-General of the BBC for the same reason. He was announced as having accepted the position of chairman with the Victoria and Albert Museum on 18 June 2007, but stepped down from the post a month later, recognising a conflict of interest with his position at the University of the Arts London. In 2013, it was announced that Tusa would be leaving his post at University of the Arts London from August that year, and that Sir John Sorrell CBE would be the new chairman. Tusa continues to write and broadcast widely. He has written two books jointly with his historian wife Ann Tusa: The Nuremberg Trial (1983) and The Berlin Blockade (1988). His writings on the arts include Art Matters, On Creativity, and The Janus Aspect: Artists in the C20. John Tusa's Engaged with the Arts: Writings from the Frontline was published in 2007.Published by I.B. Tauris, London & New York, February 2007. It explores ways that the arts can be encouraged within a cultural and political climate in which funding is constantly under threat. Since his retirement from his BBC World Service post, John Tusa has been critical of some BBC policies. He deprecated the former director general John Birt's focus and management style and has been vociferous about subsequent decisions to pare down World Service activities in Europe, including the Czech section. From January 2009 to 2014, Tusa was chair of the Clore Leadership Programme. From 2000 until 2005, Tusa interviewed 55 major figures in the arts for BBC Radio 3. From October 2009 until the end of the year Tusa presented a 91-part series on BBC Radio 4. Day By Day used original archive news material to track events on a daily basis from 1989, including the fall of the Berlin Wall. In February 2010 he became honorary chairman of theartsdesk.com. In 2014, he became co-chairman of the European Union Youth Orchestra. Tusa is a strong defender of spending on the arts and argues that cuts in arts funding do more harm than good. Honours Tusa received an honorary doctorate from Heriot- Watt University in 1993 Tusa was awarded a knighthood in the Queen's birthday honours list in June 2003.

Jenkins. It takes place from two weeks after the Rapture to 18 months into the Tribulation. Plot introduction In a series of events that followed the Rapture, in which Jesus Christ takes away members of His church from Earth, some find themselves left behind. Eventually they meet at New Hope Village Church, located in the suburbs of Chicago. They then meet from time to time and become immersed in study of prophecies contained in the Bible. Their study reveals that the Antichrist will establish control of the Earth, and the Tribulation period lasting seven years will start after his covenant with Israel. Jesus Christ's second coming will fall on the end of the Tribulation. In the course of their study, some characters in the novel form a core group which Chloe Steele christens the \\"Tribulation Force\\", dedicated to fight the seven years' war with the Antichrist. Plot summary Rayford Steele, Chloe Steele, Buck Williams and Bruce Barnes find themselves left behind. This group of believers, as well as others left behind but becoming believers, are otherwise known as \\"Tribulation Saints\\", to differentiate from the pre-Rapture designation of Christian. The question of what to do in response to this radical change in situation arises. They propose to fight the perceived threat that Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia poses in the form of eradicating all religion and establishing a single world religion. The dogma consists of the notion that \\"there is no heaven nor hell, just [the left-behind].\\" Upon being demoted at the end of the first novel, Buck moves to Chicago for his new job. He considers a relationship with Chloe Steele, debating whether or not it is worthwhile at this point in history. This leads to a misunderstanding which is eventually resolved. Buck is invited to visit Carpathia at the United Nations in New York City, where he is instituting radical changes. He tells Buck he is planning to buy all media and wants Buck to head one of the newspapers. Upon his new assistant's (Hattie Durham) recommendation, Carpathia also manipulates Rayford to become his head pilot, wanting only the best. Both Rayford and Buck are present for the signing of the treaty between the UN and Israel. Nicolae twisted the message of world-famous rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah about Messiah, in order to point to himself as thus. Buck flies to Jerusalem to meet Ben-Judah and present him to the two witnesses (described in Revelation) stationed at the United Nations-blockaded Wailing Wall. He converts to Christianity, believing that Jesus is the one and only Messiah; thus disproving Carpathia. During the prophesied eighteen months of peace following the covenant with Israel, Chloe and Buck are married, along with Rayford and new believer Amanda White, a friend of Rayford's first wife Irene. However, both Buck, who becomes publisher of Global Community Weekly, formerly Global Weekly, and Rayford, who is handpicked to pilot Carpathia's jet, are in the distressing position of watching Carpathia, now Supreme Potentate of the U.N. - now reorganized into the Global Community- strengthen his grip on the world, witnessing how he orchestrates World War III to bring the former world powers under his heel and how he bamboozles Israeli botanist Chaim Rosenzweig into giving the GC his illustrious Eden formula for a GC-guaranteed peace treaty with Israel, thus initiating the Tribulation. As World War III breaks out, the Tribulation Force suffers its first casualty in the death of their pastor, Bruce Barnes, who was killed in a bombing in the now-decimated city of Chicago.Tribulation Force by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B.

It rose to popularity in 1998, following the release of the first PC-based game in the series. The most recent version of the game is Cricket Captain 2020. The concept for International Cricket Captain was the idea of Chris Child, who programmed the original game engine as a university project. Empire producer Brian Walker produced and co-designed the game in which the player takes control of an English County Cricket squad with the aim of leading them to success in the domestic competition and ultimately being asked to take up the position of England manager. There is also an added option in later games in the ICC series to take control of one of the other Test playing nations. Taking inspiration from the hugely successful Championship Manager series of games which were also produced by Brian Walker, most aspects of a management sim are present in ICC, with the ability to coach players on their individual skills, scout opposition and buy and sell players at the end of each season. There are also comprehensive statistics available in the form of career stats pages for each player and team. Graphs and charts help the gamer to select the strongest team possible against particular opposition.England's One Man Army ICC Site Transition to console Although mainly a PC based series, there have been console cross-overs, most notably for ICC 2001 which appeared on the PlayStation. However the PS version was limited in features compared to its PC cousin and as a result was not very successful. Aside from the lack of on-line play capability, gamers noted that the transition to the console meant for longer loading periods and a slightly more tedious controller-based interface.CricketGames.com ICC page Game engine revamp ICC III was released on 6 July 2007 including a new algorithmic method of calculating player performances and a 3D match engine with motion captured shots. These changes are arguably a result of the competition that International Cricket Captain now faces from the popular Cricket Coach series, developed by Rockingham Software. The new engine replaces the original graphic highlights which were retained for each of the previous versions of the game, save minor cosmetic tweaks. Criticism Over recent years, a common criticism from games reviewersSuch as in the GameSpot Review for the 2006 version is of the perceived lack of progress in terms of the game's functionality, with the obvious change between versions tending to be limited to updated players and statistics.

She was an outspoken critic of the development of the oil infrastructure in East Africa, which she believes often comes at the expense of the local population, rather than to their benefit. She initiated Human Rights investigations, and has overseen investigations in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and been involved with monitoring human rights in 24 different countries. Rone lived in El Salvador in 1985 during their civil war. She reported on the human rights violations committed by the revolutionaries - the Sandinistas - to provide more factual evidence than the U.S. State Department was providing; they were backing the corrupt Salvadoran government.

It is situated up on the eastern foothills of the Long Mountain guarding the route from Shrewsbury, Shropshire to Montgomery, Powys on the border between England and Wales. It was destroyed during the English Civil War and has been in ruins since.  History  The early outer earthworks of the site are probably an Iron Age hillfort, while the later motte-and-bailey is of Norman construction. Roger le Corbet (or Fitz Corbet) was granted several manors in Shropshire in 1069 by William the Conqueror as the Barony of Caus for his role in the Norman conquest and invasion of England. They were named after his Normandy estate in the Pays de Caux, in France. The Corbets owed fealty to Roger de Montgomery, the first Earl of Shrewsbury to help control Welsh Marches with absolute control over their demesne. Caus Castle was built by Roger le Corbet in the late 11th century as a high motte with a very small summit on which stood a tower and a strongly defended inner bailey. The castle was sufficiently important that the Crown took an interest in its maintenance. Henry II of England had it garrisoned in 1165. In 1198 Roger Corbet re-built the tower, keep and curtain wall in stone. During the late 12th century a town or borough was founded in the large outer Bailey. A royal grant of 50 marks was made in 1263 towards further building work, when D-shape towers were added to the curtain wall. The town contained a church of St Margaret as well as the castle's church of St Nicholas, and the names of two thoroughfares, Castle Street and St Margaret Street are recorded. On the death of Beatrice Corbet in 1347 Caus passed to the Earl of Stafford. At its height the borough had 58 burgesses resident in 1349, a year coinciding with the arrival of the Black Death in England. Caus (alternatively spelled Caux or Cause) was garrisoned by the Seneschal Griffith ap Ieuan ap Madoc ap Gwenwys against the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr in the 15th century, but following calls from Welsh graduates in law and students in the University of Oxford he changed sides and supported Glynd≈µr. As a result his family lands and role at Caus Castle were forfeited in 1404, only to be restored by Henry V of England in 1419 after his sons Ieuan ap Griffith and Sir Gruffudd Vychan captured John Oldcastle for Lord Charlton of Powys. On 10 Aug. 1443, at Caus Castle Sir Gruffudd Vychan pierced with a lance the heart of his master, Sir Christopher Talbot (1419‚Äì1443), son of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and the champion tilter of England. He was outlawed, a reward of 500 marks (¬£166 6s 8d) offered for his capture, and his lands were passed to John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley, as the death of the young knight was not regarded as an accident. The Earl of Stafford rarely used the castle in the 15th and 16th centuries so that it was recorded in great decay in 1521, had only two resident tenants in 1541, and was finally deserted after it was destroyed, during the English Civil War after falling as a minor Royalist garrison in June 1645.

It is located in a relatively secluded location on the northeastern slope of Cavehill, overlooking Belfast's Antrim Road, resulting in a uniquely tranquil environment for the animals that the zoo is frequently praised for. The giraffe and zebra enclosure Belfast Zoo is one of the top fee-paying visitor attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 300,000 visitors a year. Located in north Belfast, the zoo's site is home to more than 1,200 animals and 140 species. The majority of the animals in Belfast Zoo are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo carries out important conservation work and takes part in over 90 European and international breeding programmes which help to ensure the survival of many species under threat. Belfast Zoo is owned by Belfast City Council. The council spends ¬£1.5 million every year on running and promoting the zoo, which is one of the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland. The zoo's work is overseen by the council's Parks and Leisure Committee. The committee is made up of 20 locally elected councillors. The view east from inside Belfast Zoo, showing its location on the slopes of Cavehill The story of Belfast Zoo begins with the city's public transport system. At the beginning of the 20th century, passengers from Belfast were transported to the villages of Whitewell and Glengormley by horse-drawn trams belonging to the Belfast Street Tramway company and steam tramways from Cavehill and Whitewell. In 1911, the tram line was taken over by Belfast Corporation, now Belfast City Council. The corporation decided to build a miniature railway, playground, and pleasure gardens. The area was named Bellevue, meaning 'good or pretty view'. During the 1920s and 1930s, the gardens were a popular destination for day trips. In 1933, the corporation decided to install a representative zoological collection on the site. Then, in 1934, on either side of the Grand Floral Staircase, a series of steps designed to reach the top of the hillside, were laid out as Bellevue Zoo. It took 150 men to build the site and the steps can still be seen from Antrim Road today. The zoo was opened on 28 March 1934 by Sir Crawford McCullough, the then Lord Mayor of Belfast. The venture was supported by Councillor RJR Harcourt from Belfast Corporation and was partnered by George Chapman, an animal dealer and circus entrepreneur. It cost ¬£10,000 (approximately ¬£700,000 in today's money) to build and a total of 284,713 people visited the zoo in its first year. The zoo also has a farm which houses domestic animals such as pygmy goats, Shetland ponies, miniature donkeys, Irish Moiled cattle, ferrets, rabbits, barn owls, Tamworth pigs, Gloucestershire Old Spot pigs, Vorwerk chickens, turkeys, and Berkshire pigs. The meerkats are a popular attraction at Belfast Zoo. A giraffe in the shared indoor giraffe and elephant house. Belfast Zoo is always making changes and welcoming new arrivals or celebrating births. In 2001 a wolf-like dog broke into a kangaroo enclosure and killed one of the younger kangaroos that had been born at the zoo. In June 2007, a Barbary lion cub was born at the zoo. This was the first Barbary lion to be born in Ireland. The cub was rejected by its mother and hand-reared at home by keeper Linda Frew. Lily the lion moved to Hodonin Zoo in the Czech Republic in August 2009, as part of a breeding programme. In 2008, the zoo opened a new tropical rainforest which houses such animals as two-toed sloth, red-footed tortoises and Rodrigues bats. The Rainforest House is a walk-through exhibition with tropical landscaping and a constant temperature of 27 degrees. More recently, renovations have included work on the gorilla and chimpanzee enclosures, giraffe and elephant enclosures, including a raised giraffe feeder, and new frames in the spider monkey and Andean bear enclosures. In 2009, on its 75th birthday, the zoo opened a new state-of-the-art Visitors' Centre and \\"Zoovenir\\" Shop. The refurbishment features high-level roofing with plenty of natural light and multimedia presentations showing the history of Belfast Zoo and wildlife in Northern Ireland. The zoo was awarded ¬£250,000 from the Tourism Development Scheme (TDS) from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to build the new reception area. The council has donated a further ¬£300,000 to help with the increase in visitor numbers. 2009 was a successful year with plenty of new arrivals including a Sumatran tiger called Kabus, and the only tree-kangaroo in the UK, called Kwikila. 2009 also brought the zoo's highest level of visitors in its history with over 302,000 visitors. Over 90 babies were born in the zoo in 2009. 2010 saw the arrival of two smooth-coated otters, coppery titi monkeys and a pair of toco toucans. Other new arrivals that year included a female Sumatran tiger to join Kabus. May Day in 2010 had more than double the visitors of the same day in 2009. Babies since 2009 have included a Malayan tapir, ring-tailed lemurs, a Grant's zebra, California sea lions, black-tailed prairie dogs, litters of piglets, spider monkeys, red kangaroos and many more. 2012 saw the birth of two eastern bongos, a blesbok foal, a giraffe foal and a baby chimpanzee and 2013 has seen the birth of coppery titi monkeys, a two toed sloth, another chimpanzee, twin white-belted ruffed lemurs as well as the arrival of two goodfellow's tree-kangaroos. Belfast zoo is only one of 22 worldwide zoos to hold the Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo. Located within the grounds of the zoo is a 1930s art deco ballroom, the Floral Hall. The hall was popular venue in its time and during the war the hall had blackouts fitted to the windows so that dances could continue. In the 1960s, the hall was visited by musical artists such as Pink Floyd and Small Faces. The Floral Hall closed to the public on 2 April 1972 and has remained derelict since the outbreak of the Troubles in the 1970s. During the 1990s the Floral Hall had been given Listed Building Status. Belfast Buildings Preservation Trust are planning to renovate the building, although Belfast City Council have yet to provide any funding. 2010 has seen the project be taken further, with various meetings to discuss potential uses for the hall and the carrying out of a feasibility study. In December 2011 saw the creation of a Facebook page based around sharing old photos of the Floral Hall including interior shots of the hall today, the following year an online petition, addressed to the City Council was created to help raise awareness and to progress with the restoration project of the hall. In March 2018 Liverpool based developer Signature Living officially submitted a ¬£5 million proposal to revive Belfast‚Äôs Floral Hall. Lawrence Kenwright, who owns Signature Living, said he hopes to develop the iconic building, and restore it for use as a \\"leading entertainment, conference and wedding venue\\" in the city. * Belfast Zoo website Zoos in Northern Ireland Buildings and structures in Belfast Tourist attractions in Belfast Zoos established in 1934 ","title":"Belfast Zoo"},{"id":"4296356","text":"Beth Kustan (, ) is a village in Mardin Province in southeastern Turkey. It is located in the district of Midyat and the historical region of Tur Abdin. In the village, there is a church of Mor Eliyo. Etymology The Syriac name of the village is derived from \\"beth\\" (\\"house\\" in Syriac) and \\"Kustan\\" (\\"Constantine\\" in Syriac), thus Beth Kustan translates to \\"house of Constantine\\". History The Church of Mor Eliyo was constructed in 343 AD. It is suggested that the village was founded by a member of the Roman limitanei (frontier militia) named Constans in the 4th century AD. In 1900, Beth Kustan was inhabited by an estimated 200 Assyrian families. At the onset of the Assyrian genocide, in 1915, Haco, agha (chief) of the Kurtak clan, warned the villagers of an impending attack by Turkish and Kurdish soldiers. Despite initial hesitation, upon receiving news of the massacre of Assyrians at Zaz, all but two villagers fled to Hah. Beth Kustan was subsequently ransacked by Kurdish soldiers, and the two remaining villagers were killed. The villagers resisted Kurdish and Turkish attacks at Hah until a truce was negotiated by Haco, but were not able to leave until √áelebi, agha of the Heverkan clan, helped them to return to Beth Kustan in 1922. The village was officially named Alag√∂z in the 1930s as a result of the state's turkification policy. In the 1960s, most of the village's population emigrated abroad to the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. In 1993, it was alleged that seven villagers were detained and tortured by Turkish paramilitaries. As of 2013, 15-23 Assyrian families inhabit Beth Kustan. On 12 February 2015, Beth Kustan was restored as the official name of the village. The inhabitants speak Turoyo, a dialect of Neo-Aramaic.

A cultural divide is the virtual barrier caused by cultural differences, that hinder interactions, and harmonious exchange between people of different cultures. For example, avoiding eye contact with a superior shows deference and respect in East Asian cultures, but can be interpreted as suspicious behavior in Western cultures. Studies on cultural divide usually focus on identifying and bridging the cultural divide at different levels of society.  Significance  A cultural divide can have significant impact on international operations on global organizations that require communication between people from different cultures. Commonly, ignorance of the cultural differences such as social norms and taboos may lead to communication failure within the organization. Sufficiently large cultural divides may also discourage groups from seeking to understand the other party's point of view, as differences between the groups are seen as immutable. Such gaps may in turn inhibit efforts made to reach a consensus between these groups. Factors and causes =Internal= Internal causes of Cultural Divide refer to causes based on innate or personal characteristics of an individual, such as a personal way of thinking, an internal mental structure or habit that influences how a person acts. Ideological differences Rules, norms and way of thinking are often inculcated since young and these help to shape a person's mindset and their thinking style, which will explain how two different cultural groups can view the same thing very differently. For example, Western cultures with their history of Judeo-Christian belief in the individual soul and focus on the pursuit of individual rights tend to adopt an individualistic mindset whereas East Asian cultures with a history of teachings based on Confucianism tend to view the individual as a relation to the larger community and hence develop a more collectivist mindset. Hence, it is more common for people in collectivist cultures to make an external attribution while people in individualistic cultures making an internal attribution. Thus, these differences can cause how people, situations or objects are perceived differently. Stereotypes Perceptions about an out-group or of a different culture may tend to be perpetuated and reinforced by the media or long-standing notions of stereotypes. As a result of using schemas to simplify the world as we look at it, we rely on a set of well- established stereotypes available in our own culture to define and view the out-group. As such, the risk of stereotypes is if it is inaccurate and blinds us to certain key understanding of a certain class of people, and as stereotypes tend to persist even with new information, the problem of cultural divide can be perpetuated. Social identity theory The social identity theory implies an inherent and inclined favoritism towards people of the same social group as you or people who share similar characteristics, also known as the in-group favoritism. This desire to achieve and maintain a positive self- image motivates people to place their own group in a superior position as compared to the out-group. = External = Cultural divide can also be caused by external influences that shape the way an individual thinks about people from other cultures. For example, the cultural disconnect and misunderstandings between USA and the Arab countries has been attributed to the spread of superficial information that \\"serve to promote self-interests and perpetuate reckless acts of individuals, misguided official policies and irresponsible public narratives, all colored by self-righteousness and hypocrisy\\". An individual's experience of foreign cultures can be largely shaped by the information available to the individual and the cultural divide arises due to the difference between a culture and how it is perceived by people foreign to the culture. Some examples of external sources that influence views on other cultures include: Official government policies This also includes any official source of information by the government such as speeches by government officials. Government attitudes to foreign governments often lead to information released to citizens that influence the way they think about foreign governments and foreign peoples. One extreme example of this propaganda. News and media reports Media bias can cause misunderstandings and cultural divide by controlling the information and perceptions of other cultures. For example, media bias in the United States can exacerbate the political divide between the liberals and the conservatives. Social pressure Due to a fundamental need for social companionship and a desire to be accepted and liked by others, people often conform to social norms and adopt the group's beliefs and values. Hence, groups that are already culturally divided will tend to remain that way as the effect of normative social influence is self-perpetuating.  Bridging the cultural divide  When a cultural divide can be bridged, it can be beneficial for all parties. However, when cultures are vastly different, or if people are opposed to such exchange, the cultural divide may prove difficult to cross. =Understanding cultural boundaries= Being aware of cultural boundaries when dealing with others is important to avoid accidentally offending the other party and turning the difference into a divide. Educating both parties in the reasons behind these boundaries would also help foster trust and cooperation between them. This also has a side effect of creating a virtuous cycle, where the improved understanding between both parties grants them an advantage when dealing with members of the opposite culture, encouraging future communication and reducing the impact of a cultural divide. =Cultural intelligence= Developing high cultural intelligence increases one's openness and hardiness when dealing with major differences in culture. Improving one's openness requires both humility when learning from others and inquisitiveness in actively pursuing opportunities to develop one's cultural awareness. Strong hardiness allows one to deal better with stress, cultural shocks and tension when interacting with others in a foreign context. =Increased interaction= Increasing interaction between two groups of people will help increase mutual understanding and fill in any gaps in knowledge of another group's culture. However, the quality of the interaction and not just mere contact is key to bridging cultural divide too, as supported by the contact hypothesis whereby certain key components (such as a common goal and equal status) are required before such stereotypes and preconceived mindsets which might have already been deeply entrenched can be changed. Examples An example of culture divide is that of western Europe and eastern Europe. While western Europe appears to be mostly Catholic eastern Europe is orthodox. Eastern Europe is poorer than western Europe and while the west is part of the EU the east seem to avoid the union.

She was appointed to this position by President Bill Clinton in 1994. At that time, she was the youngest sitting federal judge in the United States. She was also the first graduate of the University of Houston to be appointed to the federal bench. Education and career Gilmore was born in St. Albans, New York and raised in Silver Spring, Maryland. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Hampton University in 1977, and received her Juris Doctor from the University of Houston Law Center in 1981. Upon graduation in 1981, Gilmore began a 13-year tenure at the Houston, Texas law firm of Vickery, Kilbride, Gilmore and Vickery where she specialized in civil litigation. Gilmore also became an active member of the Houston civic community, serving on the boards of a number of civic and charitable organizations. She also became involved in the Texas political arena while serving as counsel and teacher in the area of election law. She worked as an adjunct professor at the University of Houston College of Law teaching research and writing in 1984. Her civic activities outside of the courtroom brought her to the attention of Governor Ann Richards who in 1991 appointed Gilmore to the Texas Department of Commerce Policy Board, where she also served as chairperson from 1992 to 1994. Her appointment to that board made Gilmore the first African-American to serve on this board responsible for increasing business and tourism and job training development in Texas. In 1993, she also served as chairperson of Texans for NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement). In this capacity, she worked regularly with diplomatic leaders, including the President of Mexico, to increase U.S. trade opportunities.

This is a desirable property to have in an encryption cipher, so that if one bit of the input (plaintext) is changed, every bit of the output (ciphertext) has an average of 50% probability of changing. The easiest way to show why this is good is the following: consider that if we changed our 8-byte plaintext's last byte, it would only have any effect on the 8th byte of the ciphertext. This would mean that if the attacker guessed 256 different plaintext-ciphertext pairs, he would always know the last byte of every 8byte sequence we send (effectively 12.5% of all our data). Finding out 256 plaintext-ciphertext pairs is not hard at all in the internet world, given that standard protocols are used, and standard protocols have standard headers and commands (e.g. \\"get\\", \\"put\\", \\"mail from:\\", etc.) which the attacker can safely guess. On the other hand, if our cipher has this property (and is generally secure in other ways, too), the attacker would need to collect 264 (~1020) plaintext-ciphertext pairs to crack the cipher in this way.

He was the first of the Howards to win fame as an admiral, participating in his first naval battle while in his teens. He was in command during the Battle of Saint-Mathieu, which may have been the first sea battle fought by ships with cannons deployed through ports. He was killed shortly afterwards, leading an assault on galleys in the French fleet near Brest. Early life The son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Surrey (later 2nd Duke of Norfolk) and his first wife, Elizabeth Tilney, and a younger brother of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Howard's date of birth can be determined only approximately, and nothing is known of his early upbringing or education. He began his military career in August 1492 at the age of fifteen under Sir Edward Poynings at the siege of Sluys.; . In 1497 his father, then Earl of Surrey, was given a command in Scotland and took his sons Thomas and Edward with him.. Surrey knighted both Thomas and Edward on 30 September 1497 at Ayton Castle after the signing of a treaty concluding an invasion by James IV of Scotland.; . In 1503 Howard was among those who escorted Margaret Tudor to Scotland for her marriage to King James IV. King Henry VII died on 21 April 1509. Howard played a prominent role in the tournament held to celebrate the coronation of the new King, Henry VIII, and was appointed the King's standard-bearer on 20 May 1509. Naval career Breton flagship Cordeli√®re and the Regent ablaze at the Battle of Saint- Mathieu. Illustration to Germain de Brie's poem Chordigerae navis conflagratio. Between June and August 1511 Howard was paid over ¬£600 to fit out ships for the conveying of \\"merchant aventurers\\", and both Holinshed and the Ballad of Andrew Barton record that in the course of these seafaring operations he and his brother Thomas captured the ships of the Scottish adventurer Andrew Barton. Barton was sailing in his warship Lion and the small Jennet of Purwyn, (a captured Danish ship) with a Scottish royal Letter of Marque, which was a license to plunder Portuguese ships as a privateer. Both ships were captured and taken to Blackwall. Andrew Barton was killed during their capture. When war with France broke out in April 1512, Howard was appointed admiral of a fleet of 18 ships sent by the King to keep the seas between Brest and the Thames estuary. Howard seized vessels of various nationalities on the pretext that they were carrying French cargoes. At the beginning of June, he escorted to Brittany the army which Henry was sending to France under the Marquess of Dorset with the hope of recovering Guyenne. Howard then raided Le Conquet and Crozon on the Breton coast. During June and July 1512 Howard effectively controlled the Channel and is said to have captured more than 60 vessels. By August, a French fleet had assembled at Brest. Howard attacked, and in the ensuing Battle of Saint-Mathieu the two largest ships on either side, the Regent and the Marie de la Cordeli√®re, were destroyed when the latter's magazine exploded. Although undefeated, the French retreated. On 10 October the King showed his appreciation by awarding Howard an annuity of 100 marks and the reversion of the office of Lord High Admiral held by the Earl of Oxford. The French King had Pr√©gent de Bidoux bring 6 galleys from the Mediterranean in the late autumn of 1512, and by the end of March 1513 a sizeable French fleet had been mobilized. On 10 March 1513 the Earl of Oxford died, and Howard became Lord Admiral. On 19 March he sailed from the Thames, reaching Plymouth on 5 April. Without waiting for his supply ships, he set out from Plymouth and found the French fleet, which retreated into Brest. Howard lost one ship on a hidden rock, and on 22 April was attacked by Bidoux's galleys, whose heavy guns sank another ship. On 25 April Howard decided to attack the galleys with his smaller boats known as row- barges. Howard led the attack on Bidoux's flagship in person. During the fighting he was forced over the side of the galley and drowned by the weight of his armour.News of these events came to Thomas Wolsey through the letters of William Sabine and Sir Edward Echyngham: '74. W. Sabyn to Wolsey', and '76. Edward Echyngham to Wolsey', in A. Spont (ed.), Letters and Papers Relating to the War with France, 1512-1513, Navy Records Society, Vol. X (1897), p. 141-44 and pp. 145-54 (Internet Archive). Both his body and his silver whistle, the Lord Admiral's badge of office, were found three days later, and delivered to Bidoux at Le Conquet, who sent the armour as a trophy to Princess Claude, the French King's daughter, and the whistle to Queen Anne. Demoralised by Howard's death and short of supplies, the English fleet retreated to Plymouth, where Howard's brother Thomas took command. The French were unable to exploit Howard's death, and after successful English campaigns in Picardy and Scotland, a truce was agreed on in March 1514. Howard had been elected to the Order of the Garter in 1513, but died before being installed. Marriages and issue Howard's first wife was Elizabeth Stapleton, widow of Sir William Calthorpe and Sir John Fortescue. She died on 18 February 1505.. Before January 1506 he married Alice (d. 1518), the daughter and heir of William Lovel, Lord Morley, and Eleanor, Baroness Morley, and widow of Sir William Parker. She was 10 or 12 years Howard's senior, and held the barony of Morley in her own right. There were no children of the marriage.; . When Howard wrote his will in January 1513 he left bequests to two unnamed bastard sons, commending one to the care of the King, and the other to the care of his friend Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. As a younger son, he held only the manor of Morley in Norfolk, which he willed in reversion to his stepson, Henry Parker, after the termination of his widow's life interest.

It was published in Turkish in 1990 and first translated by G√ºneli G√ºn and published in English in 1994. In 2006, it was translated into English again by Maureen Freely. Plot The protagonist, an Istanbul lawyer named Galip, finds one day that his wife R√ºya (the name means \\"dream\\" in Turkish) has mysteriously left him with very little explanation. He wanders around the city looking for his clues to her whereabouts. He suspects that his wife has taken up with her half-brother, a columnist for Milliyet named Celal, and it happens that he is also missing. The story of Galip's search is interspersed with reprints of Celal's columns, which are lengthy, highly literate meditations on the city and its history. Galip thinks that by living as Celal he can figure out how Celal thinks and locate both him and his wife, so he takes up residence in Celal's apartment, wearing his clothes and eventually writing his column. Galip starts getting mysterious phone calls from one of Celal's obsessed fans, who displays an astonishing familiarity with the columnist's writings. After Galip's columns under Celal's name start to take the form of impassioned pleas to R√ºya, a woman from Celal's past misinterprets the articles and calls Galip, thinking they are actually Celal's attempts to win her back. It turns out that Celal and the woman had an affair, and the fan who is calling Galip is the woman's jealous husband. In an eerie twist, it turns out that the husband has been following Galip around Istanbul in an attempt to find Celal through him, accounting for Galip's frequent apprehension that he is being watched. Galip finally agrees to meet both of them at a public location, a store called Aladdin's that figures in much of the narrative. Soon after, Celal is shot to death in the street. R√ºya is found also shot in Aladdin's store. The identity of the killer is never discovered for certain. The novel ends with the postmodern twist of the author revealing his presence in the narrative. The story is more concerned with exploring the nature of story-telling as a means of constructing identity than with a straightforward plot. As such, it is full of stories within the main story, relating to both Turkey's Ottoman past and contemporary Istanbul. Interpretation In 1992 Kara Kitap √ºzerine Yazƒ±lar was published as an anthology of critical essays. The main theme of the novel is identity, and it returns on many levels. Galip for example, is clearly not happy with who he is. He dislikes his life as a lawyer, and has envied the successful Celal for years. The plot shows how he gradually changes his identity to become Celal, living in his flat, wearing his clothes and even writing his columns. We know however, that Celal longs to become someone else as well (this is clearly visible from some of his columns - see for example the one titled 'I Must Be Myself'). R√ºya remains quite enigmatic in the novel, the only picture we get of her is through the subjective lens of Galip. She sleeps during the day, and reads detective novels in the evenings and at night, hardly ever leaving the house. It seems that she prefers to escape from reality to the world of her detective novels, although Galip doesn't seem to think much of these. This strange lifestyle can imply that she is also not satisfied with who she is, or how her life turned out, but perhaps she does not consciously think about it, or admit it to herself. The questions of who we are and whether its possible to change who we are return on at least two other levels: Istanbul's identity as a city, and the identity of the Turkish people. As Galip wanders the streets of Istanbul, we get to know many of the city's different neighborhoods, all with their distinct ambiance. This is a city where East and West, antiquity and the modern, Islam and the secular, the rich and the poor, the pashas and the peasants are all present. The question always lingers: what is the true identity of this city? Is it a modern metropolis, or a dying remnant of the once-great Constantinople? The questions of Turkish national identity are referenced several times, in relation mainly to the perceived westernization of Turkish society. Should the Turkish people embrace Western (European) culture, or should they remain true to their heritage? Is their culture and identity decaying or only transforming? The novel in many cases implies that embracing the former will destroy not just historical and cultural heritage, but also the Turkish people themselves (see part where Galip takes the tour of the underground mannequin museum). Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of the modern Turkish state is seen as a controversial figure. His efforts to westernize Turkey have led to mixed results.

A Tale of the Year Sixteen Hundred and Fifty-one (1826) is a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, one of the Waverley novels. Set just after the English Civil War, it was inspired by the legend of the Good Devil of Woodstock, which in 1649 supposedly tormented parliamentary commissioners who had taken possession of a royal residence at Woodstock, Oxfordshire. The story deals with the escape of Charles II in 1652, during the Commonwealth, and his final triumphant entry into London on 29 May 1660. Composition and sources Scott began composing Woodstock at the very end of October 1825. He appears to have made rapid progress at first, but there were many interruptions during December and the second volume was not finished until 11 February 1826. He completed the final volume on 26 March.Walter Scott, Woodstock, ed. Tony Inglis with J. H. Alexander, David Hewitt, and Alison Lumsden (Edinburgh, 2009), 426‚Äì29. The History of England by David Hume (1754‚Äí62), which Scott admired above all others, gave him most of what he needed for the historical background, though for many details he was able to draw on his profound acquaintance with the literature of the seventeenth century. For the goings-on at Woodstock Manor he was familiar with two accounts accepting a supernatural explanation in Satan's Invisible world Discovered by George Sinclair (1685) and Saducismus Triumphatus by Joseph Glanvil (1700). He also knew, though not necessarily at first hand, the version of the story in The Natural History of Oxford-shire by Robert Plot (1677), adopting its more sceptical approach to the business.Ibid., 537‚Äì42. Editions The first edition of Woodstock was published in Edinburgh by Archibald Constable and Co. and Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green in London on 28 April 1826.For a description of the early editions see Ibid., 444‚Äì54. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The price was one and a half guineas (¬£1 11s 6d or ¬£1.57¬Ω.).William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, Sir Walter Scott: A Bibliographical History 1796‚Äì1832 (New Castle, Delaware, 1998), 627. Scott does not seems to have revisited the novel until the spring of 1831 when he revised the text and provided an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition, in which it appeared as Volumes 39 and 40 in August and September 1832. The standard modern edition, by Tony Inglis with J. H. Alexander, David Hewitt, and Alison Lumsden, was published as Volume 19 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2009: this is based on the first edition with emendations mainly from the manuscript and corrected proofs; the 'Magnum' material appears in Volume 25b (2012). Plot summary At a thanksgiving service in Woodstock church for the victory at Worcester (3 September 1651), the Rev. Nehemiah Holdenough was compelled to cede the pulpit, which he had usurped from the late rector (Dr Rochecliffe), to Joseph Tomkins, who, in military attire, declaimed against monarchy and prelacy, and announced the sequestration of the royal lodge and park by Cromwell and his followers. Proceeding thither, he encountered Sir Henry Lee, accompanied by his daughter Alice, prepared to surrender his charge, and was conducted through the principal apartments by the forester Joliffe, who managed to send his sweetheart Phoebe and dog Bevis with some provisions to his hut, in which the knight and his daughter had arranged to sleep. On arriving there they found Colonel Everard, a Roundhead who had come to offer them his own and his father's protection; but Sir Henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel, and at Alice's entreaty he bade them farewell, as he feared, for ever. On his way to the lodge he met his Royalist friend, Captain Wildrake, whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics, and determined to send him with an appeal to Cromwell to reinstate his uncle at Woodstock. On reaching Windsor, the captain, disguised as a Roundhead, obtained an interview with Oliver Cromwell, and a compliance with Everard's request, on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king's son, in the event of his seeking refuge with the Lees. Armed with the warrant of ejectment, the colonel and Wildrake, accompanied by the mayor and the minister, visited the Commissioners during their evening carouse, and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed. Everard made his way alone to a dark gallery, in which he fancied he heard his cousin's voice, and suddenly felt a sword at his throat. Meeting Wildrake as he regained the hall, they hurried off to the hut where they found Dr Rochecliffe reading the Church service to Sir Henry and his daughter; and, after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew, the cousins were allowed a private interview, during which Alice warned her lover against betraying the king. Returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events; and during the night Everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters. The sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds, and the Commissioners decided to retire to the village inn. Master Holdenough, too, confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned. Woodstock Palace The following day Sir Henry Lee was induced to resume his post, and his son Albert arrived with one \\"Louis Kerneguy\\", whom he introduced as his Scotch page. Sir Henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony; and while Dr Rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to Holland, the disguised Charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain Alice's love; but, in spite of a declaration of his rank, she made him ashamed of his suit. A quarrel, however, having arisen between him and Everard, she evinced her loyalty by preventing a duel they had arranged, at the risk of her reputation and the loss of her cousin's affection. A similar attempt by Tomkins to trifle with Phoebe was punished by a death-blow from Joliffe. The next evening Everard and his friend, and Holdenough, were unexpectedly made prisoners by Cromwell, who, having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king's sojourn at Woodstock, had brought a large force to secure him. Wildrake, however, managed to send his page Spitfire to the lodge to warn them, and while Alice acted as Charles's guide, Albert, in his dress, concealed himself in Rosamond's tower. Cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with Dr Rochecliffe and Joliffe, whom they had seized as they were burying Tomkins, and, having searched all the rooms and passages in vain, they proceeded to blow up the tower. Albert, however, leapt from it just before the explosion, and Cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception. In his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors, including his dog; but afterwards released them, with the exception of Albert, who was imprisoned, and subsequently fell in the battle of Dunkirk (1658). Alice returned in safety, with the news that the king had effected his escape, and a letter from him to Sir Henry, approving of her marriage with Everard, whose political opinions had been considerably influenced by recent events. Eight years later Wildrake arrived at Brussels with news for Charles. After Cromwell's son Richard abdicated, the Protectorate was abolished and the country descended into chaos. Order was restored when George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, marched into the City of London with his army and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament excluded during Pride's Purge. The Long Parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years, there was a general election. The Convention Parliament assembled and voted for Charles' restoration. In his progress to London, Charles, escorted by a brilliant retinue, amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects, dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of Ditchley, whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign's hand, and whose contented death almost immediately followed the realisation of his anxious and long-cherished hopes.

On his way to London he passes the Lee-Everard family and receives Sir Henry's blessing before the old man dies. Reception There was very general agreement among the reviewers that Woodstock occupied a middle rank in the Waverley novels, with a handful rating it highly and two or three condemning it.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews of \\"Woodstock\\" see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1821‚Äí1826: A Bibliography (New York and London, 1977), 179‚Äí80. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 264‚Äí65. Little enthusiasm is discernible for the thin plot and the tedious succession of tricks played on the Commissioners in the Lodge. On the other hand, several of the characters were more often than not deemed impressive. Doubts were expressed about Cromwell's historicity and tendency towards the sentimental, but he was widely recognised as a strong presentation. Charles was also deemed a success, as were Lee, Alice, and Wildrake in their different ways. Views differed on the question of authorial impartiality or otherwise. A formidable essay in The Westminster Review analysed Scott's lack of historical verisimilitude in his presentation of the characters, concentrating on the stylistic incoherence of their dialogue. Cultural references In Two Years Before the Mast the author/narrator recounts reading Woodstock to his fellow sailors.

It is located in the district of Midyat and the historical region of Tur Abdin. In the village, there are churches of Mor Dimet and Mort Shmuni. There is also the ruins of the church of Mor Gabriel. History Zaz is identified as the settlement of Zazabukha, where the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II made camp whilst on campaign against Nairi and received tribute from Khabkhi in 879 BC. Arches on the north side of the church of Mor Dimet suggest pre-Christian buildings originally stood on the site. The church of Mor Dimet was constructed by 932, from which year a funerary inscription survives. A copy of the Syriac diptychs (, \\"Book of Life\\") written in the village in the early 16th century was found in 1909, but was lost in the Assyrian genocide. By 1915, Zaz was exclusively inhabited by 2000 Assyrians, with 200 families, all of whom were adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church. Amidst the Assyrian genocide in the First World War, the village was attacked by Kurds in August 1915, and the villagers took refuge in the church of Mor Dimet and two large houses. After receiving assurances the villagers wouldn't be harmed, 365/366 Assyrians left the buildings, but were taken by the Kurds to a hill named Perbume between Zaz and He≈ütrek and slaughtered. A survivor of the massacre at Perbume returned to Zaz and warned the villagers, who subsequently held out for a month. Some survivors fled to Ayn Wardo. An Ottoman official arrived at the village and assured the villagers of their safety, only to separate the young, who were given to Kurds from neighbouring villages, and split the remaining Assyrians in two groups. One group was sent to Kerboran, and the other was sent to Midyat, where they were forced to collect and bury the corpses of Assyrians who had been killed in the streets of those places, as well as pick up animal faeces. Those who did not die of hunger or thirst were killed once the corpses were buried. Some villagers who had survived the genocide were helped to return to Zaz in 1920 by √áelebi, agha (chief) of the Heverkan clan. A portico was added to the church of Mor Dimet in 1924. In the early 1990s, there were skirmishes between paramilitaries, the Turkish military, and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants near the village as part of the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict. Paramilitaries and their relatives extorted 20 million Turkish lira from the villagers on 18 February 1992 on threat of killing the mukhtar Gevriye Akyol (village headman). The Assyrian villagers were forced to flee to Midyat in April 1993 upon receiving death threats from paramilitaries, and they remained there in the hope the situation would improve, but again received death threats on returning to Zaz in the summer. The four Kurdish families were allowed to remain, whereas the Assyrians emigrated to Europe, particularly Germany and Sweden. The church of Mor Dimet was restored in the late 1990s by Assyrians in the diaspora, and a monk and nun took up residence in the church in 2001. It was reported that Kurds from neighbouring villages had seized the Assyrians' houses and land, damaged the church by pouring sewage into it, and verbally and physically abused the monk and nun.

A powerful, right- handed hitting and throwing outfielder, Lemon teamed with first baseman Roy Sievers and later with slugger Harmon Killebrew and outfielder Bob Allison to form the most formidable home run-hitting tandem in the 60-year history of the first Washington Senators franchise. Playing career Born in Covington, Virginia, the , , Lemon was known as \\"Bob\\" before he signed with MLB. He signed originally with the Cleveland Indians (becoming known as Jim Lemon to avoid confusion with pitcher Bob Lemon) but he never won a regular job with Cleveland; indeed, he was a \\"late-bloomer\\" who required several trips to the minor leagues before finally winning a regular berth with the 1956 Senators at the age of 28. A free-swinger who three times led the American League in striking out, Lemon and his teammates benefitted from new Washington owner Calvin Griffith's decision to move the left field fences closer to home plate in the Senators' cavernous ballpark, Griffith Stadium. Lemon smashed 27 homers in 1956, also leading the league in triples, then followed with 26 (1958), 33 (1959) and 38 (1960). He twice compiled over 100 runs batted in and became a favorite of U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower after Eisenhower attended Lemon's 3-home-run performance at Griffith Stadium in 1956.Cool of the Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins However, the home run exploits of Lemon and his teammates were more than offset by poor pitching, and after multiple second-division finishes in the AL, Griffith moved the Senators to Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul after the 1960 campaign to become the Minnesota Twins. But Lemon left his stroke behind in Washington, and after only 14 homers in Minnesota in 1961 and an injury-ruined 1962, his career wound down quickly. His last year as a player, 1963, was divided among the Twins, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox. All told, he appeared in 1,010 games over all or parts of 12 major league seasons and batted .262 with 164 home runs. Coach and manager Lemon remained in the game as a coach for the Twins, serving two different terms (1965‚Äì67; 1981‚Äì84) in that role, including with the 1965 pennant-winning team. In between, in 1968, he returned to Washington as manager of the expansion Senators, but his popularity as a player did not translate to a successful managerial record. His club finished last in the ten-team American League, winning 65 games and losing 96 (.404)‚Äîbut it did feature a fearsome, right- handed power-hitter in Frank Howard. Lemon was fired after only one season. As a native son, and to honor his batting achievements with the original Senators, he was elected to the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.

Leonard Librande, Studia Islamica, No. 100/101 (2005), pp. 5-42. Published by: Maisonneuve & Larose It is seen as \\"perfect trust in God and reliance on Him alone.\\" It can also be referred to as God-consciousness. In fact, the Qur'an speaks of the fact that success is only achieved when trust is in God and the believer is steadfast and obeys God's commands. Tawakkul as a theological concept was formalized by Shaqiq al-Balkhi (d. 810), who defined it as a spiritual state or hal. Tawakkul is also considered a natural result of extreme zuhd.\\"The Transition from Asceticism to Mysticism at the Middle of the Ninth Century C.E.\\", Melchert, Christopher. Studia Islamica, No. 83 (1996), pp. 51-70. Published by: Maisonneuve & Larose Zuhd can be described as being based on tawakkul or \\"trust in God alongside love of poverty.\\" This has led to an argument over whether or not tawakkul is a consequence of perfect faith. An author wrote that someone that trusts in God is like a baby seeking its mother's breast and always finds it. He says that just like the infant, the one who trusts God is always led to God. It has been said that there are three ranks of tawakkul: the trust of the believers, the trust of the select, and the trust of the select of the select. Each of these ranks are achieved through active reformation of the mind and self. The truth of the believers is simply living one day at a time and not worrying what tomorrow will bring you; simply trusting in what God has planned. The trust of the select is trusting God with no motives or desires. It is casting aside all wants. And finally the trust of the select of the select is giving yourself over to God completely so that His desires become yours. In other words, \\"trust in God is to be satisfied with and rely on God Most High.\\" It is said that because God created everything and therefore everything belongs to him, it is selfish to want anything other than what God wants or not want something God gives to you. The Arabic word tawakkul is a masdar (verbal noun) derived from the fifth form of the Arabic root ŸàŸÉŸÑ (w-k-l). It translates to \\"to give oneself over to, to rely/depend on, or have confidence in another\\".Scott C. Alexander, \\"Truth and Patience.\\" Encyclopedia of the Quran, Leiden, Brill, 2006. Muslim tradition Quranic references: the active participle form of tawakkul is used in 38 passages in the Qur'an. * And whoever puts all his trust in Allah, He will be enough for him. * And put all your trust [in Allah], if you truly are believers. * He is Rabb of the east and west, there is no deity except Him, so take him as your Protector. * Put your trust in the living Allah who never dies, and celebrate His praise. * In Allah should the trustful trust. Hadith: Umar bin Khattab said: I heard Muhammad saying, \\"If you all depend on Allah with due reliance, He would certainly give you provision as He gives it to the birds who go forth hungry in the morning and return with full bellies at dusk.\\" (At-Tirmidhi) Many Muslim legends such as those of Rabi'a illustrate tawakkul. Of Rabi'a, it is said that when her donkey died in the desert while she was on the hajj, she refused aid from a caravan, instead depending on God to provide for her.Sells, Michael A: Early Islamic Mysticism, page 157. Paulist Press, 1996. Sahl al-Tustarƒ´ claimed that perceiving secondary causes was a sign of a lack of reliance on God. Interpretation Since early times in Islam there has been debate as to the extent of tawakkul as a virtue in everyday life.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W. P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online This debate centered around questions such as whether or not tawakkul allowed for God to use intermediary causes, and the degree of reliance on God. Views of extreme and total dependence on God to the point of pure fatalism were popular among rejectionist ascetics.\\"The Ethical Concerns of Classical Sufism\\", Awn, Peter J.

The possible existence of the Blackstar program was reported in March 2006 by Aviation Week & Space Technology (Aviation Week, AWST) magazine; the magazine reported that the program had been underway since at least the early 1990s, and that the impetus for Blackstar was to allow the United States government to retain orbital reconnaissance capabilities jeopardized following the 1986 Challenger disaster. The article also said that the United States Air Force's Space Command was unaware of Blackstar, suggesting it was operated by an intelligence agency such as the National Reconnaissance Office.\\"Two-Stage-to- Orbit 'Blackstar' System Shelved at Groom Lake?.\\" Scott, W., Aviation Week & Space Technology. March 5, 2006.\\"Did Pentagon create orbital space plane?.\\" Oberg, J., NBC News. March 6, 2006. Aviation Week speculated that such a spacecraft could also have offensive military capabilities, a concept colloquially known as \\"The Space Bomber\\".\\"Bush plans 'space bomber' .\\" Vulliamy, E., The Observer. July 29, 2001.\\"Pentagon planning for space bomber.\\" Windrem, R., MSNBC. August 14, 2001. The magazine also stated that it was likely that Blackstar would be mothballed, although it is unclear whether this is due to cost or failure of the program. The Aviation Week report was dismissed a few days later as \\"almost certainly bogus\\" and the project termed a \\"technical absurdity\\" by Jeffrey F. Bell in an article in Space Daily. The Blackstar system Aviation Week describes Blackstar as a two-stage-to-orbit system, the first stage of which is a delta-winged supersonic jet (which Aviation Week referred to as the SR-3). Its description of SR-3 is similar to the North American B-70 Valkyrie Mach 3 strategic bomber, and to patents filed in the 1980s by Boeing. The SR-3 would carry a second, smaller airframe, codenamed the XOV (eXperimental Orbital Vehicle) underneath, between its two laterally separated engine-banks, each containing 2 or 3 engines. This rocket- powered spaceplane, with similarities to the X-20 Dyna-Soar project, would be released by its mothership at an altitude of around 100,000 feet. The XOV would then light its rocket motor (aerospike engines, similar to those used by the Lockheed Martin X-33), and could achieve both suborbital and orbital flight; one source quoted by Aviation Week estimates the XOV could reach an orbit of above the Earth, depending on payload and mission profile. The XOV would then reenter the atmosphere and glide back to any landing site where it would land horizontally on a conventional runway. This combination of jet- powered mothership and a smaller rocket-powered spaceplane resembles the civilian Tier One spaceplane system as well as NASA's X-15, but capable of much higher velocities and thus of attaining orbit. Readers are cautioned to examine the challenges involved in supersonic separation of vehicles as opposed to the more common subsonic separation of ordnance from aircraft, but this separation from the belly might be easier than from the top, which proved to be problematic on the Lockheed D-21/M-21. The program The primary use of a military spaceplane such as Blackstar would be to conduct high-altitude or orbital reconnaissance, allowing surprise overflights of foreign locations with very low risk of the spyplane being successfully engaged by existing air- defense systems. This is similar to the goals of the earlier U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft; in some circumstances such an overflight yields more information than a pass by a reconnaissance satellite, as the satellite's path is predictable, allowing sensitive material to be hidden. Military analysts have suggested that a military spaceplane could also be used to place small satellites in orbit, to retrieve them, to provide a means of launching nuclear weapons from orbit, or to serve as a platform for exotic orbit-to-ground hypervelocity weapons. The small spaceplane described by Aviation Week appears to have only a very modest cargo capacity, limiting its use in such missions. Aviation Week suggests that the huge costs of the Blackstar program were borne both by the Department of Defense's own black budget and by hiding the costs of Blackstar inside the procurement costs attached to acknowledged military purchases. To assist in this, and to allow politicians to deny the USAF operates such a vehicle, the Blackstar assets may nominally be owned and operated by the civilian defense contractors who built it. The magazine suggests that a consortium of Boeing and Lockheed is responsible for Blackstar. It is unclear if the Blackstar program became fully operational, although it may have been so since the mid-1990s. Aviation Week's article speculated that the success of Blackstar explains the Government's willingness to cancel the SR-71 Blackbird and Air Force satellite-launch programs. Similar aircraft During the 1970s, when studies were underway which led to the specification of the Space Shuttle, most leading US aerospace contractors explored orbital spaceplane designs, some based on a two-stage design. The most serious of these was the Lockheed HGV under the X-24C program, which was a manned hypersonic vehicle dropped from underwing a B-52, even to the point of rumors that it had actually been flight tested, according to Encyclopedia Astronautica. With the adoption of the Space Shuttle design, these avenues appear to have been abandoned. The use of a spaceplane as part of the launching system to replace the Space Shuttle has been suggested in programs such as VentureStar. Some of the details of the SR-3 resemble the rumored Brilliant Buzzard or ‚ÄúMothership‚Äù aircraft, which was alleged to carry reconnaissance aircraft on top, rather than on the bottom as with the SR-3. The second stage of Brilliant Buzzard was considered a hypersonic aircraft, and the lengthening of runways at facilities such as Area 51 (taken by some as evidence of Aurora) could instead be necessary either to support SR-3's takeoff or XOV's landing.. In the late 1960s the North American Aircraft Corporation studied conceptual designs using the B-70 bomber for small space launch of an X-15 type rocket plane. These were abandoned as unpromising. What is known, and a matter of public record, is that, through the 1980s and 1990s, the USAF did undertake a series of projects to study, research, develop and test demonstrator vehicles capable of SSTO (single-stage-to-orbit) and TSTO (two-stage-to-orbit) missions. These programs were code-named, in order, Science dawn, Science realm, and Copper canyon, and involved the development of three different competitive demonstrator vehicles. It was at the conclusion of Copper canyon's design phase that President Reagan proposed the X-30 NASP, which is claimed to have been used to pay for development of this spaceplane. According to one declassified Rand Corp. report, two of the three vehicles failed to achieve their full flight envelope (i.e. couldn't make orbit), while the third, an \\"assisted SSTO\\", did achieve orbital capability. Furthermore, three code-named programs to design the stealthing of these three vehicles fell under the programs known as Have blinders I, II and III. All of these programs can be found in US military budget documents with associated budget account numbers for years in the 1980s up into the mid-1990s (in the case of Copper coast), though the code name was dropped from the account number in the mid-1990s, even though many millions were budgeted up until recent years. Whether any of these vehicles were individually code named \\"Blackstar\\" is unknown at this time.

Geography Bullecourt lies on the Upper Cretaceous plain of Artois between Arras and Bapaume and east of the A1 motorway. This satellite photograph shows Bullecourt just north of centre. Qu√©ant is the larger of the two villages near the eastern edge. The A1 and the high-speed (TGV) railway line run up the western edge. To the south of Bullecourt, a now closed local railway line snakes from east to west. Population Transportation Bullecourt lies in the triangle made by the A1, A2 and A26 motorways and that made by the N17, N30 and D939 roads. History There were remains from the Gallo-Roman period and the village was mentioned under the name \\"Bullecortis\\", in 1096. In 620, it was the birthplace of Saint Vindicien, a follower of Saint Eligius, known in French as Saint Eloi. Vindicien became successively, bishop of Arras and bishop of Cambrai. He is regarded as the founder of the abbey named after his mentor, Mont St Eloi, of which Bullecourt became a lordship. War has twice completely destroyed the village: in 1543 during the Ninth Italian War (1542‚Äì1546) and in 1917, during the First World War. The remains of Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt (as seen after the war, in 1920). In early 1917, during the northern hemisphere spring, two battles at Bullecourt became significant to the military history of Australia in particular. The village lay at the southern end of a highly active front ‚Äì and formed part of the Hindenburg Line. On April 11, in the First Battle of Bullecourt, two brigades of the Australian 4th Division attacked German positions in Bullecourt, supported by 12 tanks but without artillery support. Caught in heavy fire, the Australians were forced to retreat. The Australian 4th Brigade alone sustained losses of 2,258 killed, wounded or taken prisoner, out of approximately 3,000 infantry. Only 750 Germans soldiers were killed, while they captured 27 Australian officers and 1,137 other ranks. On May 3, 1917, in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, an attack on both flanks of the village was conducted by the Australian 2nd Division and British 62nd Division respectively. Bullecourt itself was recaptured, but the anticipated breakthrough on the Hindenburg line did not occur. In total, there were 14,000 Australian and British casualties. The Mus√©e Jean et Denise Letaille (established in 2012) now commemorates this fighting. Sights While there were many bunkers and dugouts, from the period of the Hindenburg Line, there is also an underground shelter from the 17th century. The church of St. Vlaast was rebuilt after 1918. There is a museum of objects collected from the periods of the world wars. Economy and village life The economy is one of general farming with the raising of beef. The village has an agricultural cooperative. The village festival is held on the first Sunday of June and there is a festival in honour of the Australians on the last Saturday in April.

Leuven, 3 December 1483) was a Brabantine architect from the 15th century. He was employed in Leuven from 1433, first under the architect Sulpitius van Vorst (d. 1439), and afterwards under Jan Keldermans II, whom he succeeded in 1445 as master mason. In that capacity he developed the town fortifications and led the construction of the Leuven Town Hall (1448‚Äì1469), as well as the transept of the Saint Peter's Church. The sacrament tower of that church, built in 1451, is also attributed to him. Around 1450, de Layens worked on the St. Leonard's Church in Zoutleeuw, the \\"Our Lady of the Pool\\" (Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ten-Poel) church at Tienen, and the St. Sulpitius Church at Diest. From 1457 he took over, from architect Jan Spijkens, the construction of Saint Waltrude Collegiate Church at Mons, and restored the town hall there in 1479. His last work (1480‚Äì1487) was the monumental Round Table building (het Tafelrond) on the east side of Leuven's Grote Markt square. The building was torn down and replaced in about 1818, but was reconstructed in its original style and location in 1921.

Biography Curtis Warren is the second son of South American born Curtis Aloysius Warren, a seaman with the Norwegian Merchant Navy, and Antonia Chantre, the daughter of a shipyard boiler attendant.Curtis Warren: The rise and fall of the notorious Liverpool gangster - Liverpool Echo He grew up with his elder brother Ramon and sister Maria in Toxteth, Liverpool. =Bouncer= After Warren was released from jail local police commented that he had turned his life around, working as a bouncer at a Liverpool nightclub. But it was here that he learnt about the drugs trade, as bouncers have the power to control who comes in and out of a venue. He was able to control dealers' access and then befriend them, giving him an inside education. =Charrington and acquittal= In the late 1980s, he came to a working agreement with Middlesbrough businessman Brian Charrington. In September 1991, using Charrington's personal yacht, the two men sailed to France on then-legal British visitor passports. They then travelled to Venezuela on British 10-year passports, and arranged a deal with the Cali cartel to smuggle cocaine in steel boxes, concealed in lead ingots. On arrival in the UK, HM Customs and Excise cut open one ingot, but found nothing. Having let the shipment pass, they were later informed by Dutch police that the drugs were held in the steel boxes; by which time Charrington, Warren and the shipment were untraceable. However, a second shipment of using the same method was already in transit from South America. When the shipment landed in the UK in early 1992, Charrington, Warren and twenty-six others were placed under arrest in a prosecution brought by HM Customs and Excise. However, in preliminary court procedures, it was revealed by police that Charrington was a police informant for the North-East Regional Crime Squad. HM Customs officials went forward with their prosecution, despite protests from his police \\"handlers\\" Harry Knaggs and Ian Weedon. In Newcastle Crown Court, it was alleged that Warren was so well informed, that he knew the length of the largest drill bit owned by HM Customs, and therefore the size/depth of the required ingots. Eventually, through Conservative MP Tim Devlin, a meeting was arranged in which Customs was ordered to drop charges against Charrington on 28 January 1993. The case was dropped, with all accused including Warren acquitted of all charges. It is alleged that on release, Warren purposefully walked past the HM Customs agents, saying: \\"I'm off to spend my ¬£87 million from the first shipment and you can't touch me.\\" Several months later, Knaggs was spotted by HM Customs officials driving a ¬£70,000 BMW, previously registered to Charrington. =Netherlands= Warren returned to Liverpool. But with the combination of various ritual killings of several organised crime figures, and the police pursuing him following the high-profile case failure, he decided he had to move. In 1995, Warren relocated to a villa in Sassenheim in the Netherlands. He owns casinos in Spain; discos in Turkey; a vineyard in Bulgaria; land in the Gambia; and money stashed away in Swiss bank accounts. He could have retired rich, but decided to continue. Monitored by police calling his contacts in the UK, it was now that Warren's photographic memory was useful for him: he never called contacts by their names, but code words; all of the Swiss bank account details were kept in his mind, never written down; he never kept accounts for his drug dealing business. The result was that he had an unlimited credit line from cartels in South America, and with cannabis traffickers in Turkey and Eastern Europe. =Dutch arrest and prison= On 24 October 1996, Brigade Speciale Beveiligingsopdrachten raided Warren's villa, and other property he owned in the Netherlands. Warren and several associates were arrested, with police finding three guns, ammunition; hand grenades, crates with 960 CS gas canisters, of cocaine, of cannabis resin, of heroin, of ecstasy, and 400,000 Dutch guilder plus 600,000 US Dollars in cash. The whole haul was estimated to be worth ¬£125 million. In 1998, Warren made his only appearance in The Sunday Times Rich List, which stated as a property developer his fortune was estimated at ¬£40 million. His conviction in the subsequent trial ensured his removal. In court, Warren's plan was shown to be the shipment of South American cocaine to Bulgaria. Shipped to his vineyard, the drugs were then suspended in wine for onward shipment to the Netherlands and Liverpool in the UK. In total, police had retained illegal goods, drugs and wine valued at ¬£125 million. Warren was sentenced to 12 years in jail, in the maximum security Nieuw Vosseveld prison in Vught. However, further forensic accounting investigation only found ¬£20 million of his estimated ¬£120 million fortune, and none of that could be legally touched or confiscated by Dutch police, British police or Interpol. Manslaughter conviction On the afternoon of 15 September 1999, Warren had a fight in the prison yard with Turkish national Cemal Guclu, who was serving a 20-year sentence for murder and attempted murder. Yelling abuse at Warren, Guclu walked towards him and tried to punch him in the face. Evading the punch, a short fight ensued, during which Guclu fell to the ground, and Warren kicked him in the head 4 times, Guclu got up and again went for Warren and was again punched to the ground. It was here he hit his head and became unconscious from which Guclu never recovered and died in hospital. In his trial defence in 2001, Warren said he \\"acted in self defence.\\" Finding Warren guilty of manslaughter, the Dutch judge commented that \\"the defendant had used excessive violence,\\" sentencing him to an additional four years with release scheduled in 2014. In 2002, Dutch police still investigating the Bulgarian shipment obtained an asset seizure order against Warren. Although they could only find ¬£180,000, they legally charged him to repay 26 million guilders ($14 million) under the proceeds of crime act, or face an added 5 years in prison; this would have extended his release date to 2019. After legal discussion ensued, Warren agreed to pay Dutch police 15 million guilders ($8 million). Trafficking case and release In February 2005, Warren was charged by Dutch authorities with running an international drugs smuggling cartel from his Dutch prison cell. Moved around six jails during his trial for his own safety, he was found guilty but successfully appealed, and was released from prison in June 2007. He was driven back to Liverpool in a Lexus. Refused a passport by the British, Irish and Portuguese governments, the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency then followed Warren's every move as part of a \\"lifetime offender management\\" programme, under the codename Operation Floss. In November 2007, Warren's former right-hand man, Colin Smith, was shot dead while leaving Nel's gym in Speke. =Jersey conviction= Under SOCA's \\"Operation Floss,\\" just three weeks after being freed from prison in the Netherlands, on Saturday, 30 June 2007, SOCA called Jersey Police to inform them that Warren had arrived at Manchester Airport, and paid cash for a plane ticket. Observed in Jersey with known Liverpool associate and now Jersey resident Taffin Carter, the pair drove around in Carter's VW Golf to various locations, including the isolated St Catherine's Breakwater. With drugs at three times the street price in Jersey compared with the UK or France, after Warren returned to the UK, Jersey Police created \\"Operation Koala,\\" monitoring and bugging various locations, including phone boxes and the home of Taffin's girlfriend, Suzanne Scurr. From this they discovered that a friend of Warren, John Welsh, intended to travel to Amsterdam to meet with known Warren associate, Moroccan Mohammed Liazid, Jersey Police wanted to bug Welsh's hire car from St Malo, but were refused permission by French and Belgian police, saying it was a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In what Judge Sir Richard Tucker later described as a \\"reprehensible\\" and \\"unlawful\\" act, Jersey Police, which is not signed into but bound by the ECHR, bugged the car anyway, and with Dutch Police, SOCA and Interpol monitored the transmissions. In subsequent operations, SOCA monitored Warren in Liverpool, while Dutch police monitored police informant Liazid in Amsterdam, and co- ordinated information from various phone boxes to correlate who was speaking to whom. In the subsequent trial, it was revealed that Warren had three UK and one Jersey mobile, and had made 1,587 telephone calls in three weeks from these and phone boxes across the northwest and North Wales, including the Wirral, Liverpool, Manchester, Llangollen and Chester to Liazid. In 2007, Warren was arrested in St Helens, over conspiracy to smuggle drugs; after a joint investigation involving Jersey police, Merseyside Police, SOCA, and law enforcement from Belgium, France and the Netherlands. He pleaded not guilty, and there ensued a two-year legal argument over the legality of the information obtained by the bugging of Welsh's car. After agreement that there was sufficient evidence from other sources to substantiate the case, Jersey Police offered him a deal for pleading guilty of an 8-year jail term and no confiscation of assets: Warren turned this down. The Metropolitan Police agreed to lend Jersey Police a manned armoured prisoner transfer van, so Warren and his associates could be transferred safely during each day of the trial. The court heard that no drugs had been imported as the Jersey contacts had \\"failed to come up with the money\\".Jersey Evening Post:8 October 2009 Senator Ben Shenton raised concerns that Warren's legal representation was at the cost of the Jersey taxpayer, while Progress Jersey raised concerns that the entire resources of the Jersey drug squad had been targeted at Warren.Jersey Evening Post:9 October 2009 Warren was found guilty on 7 October for conspiracy to smuggle cannabis.

In November 2013, Warren was ordered to pay a ¬£198m confiscation order, or face another ten years in jail. On 27 March 2014 it was reported that Warren had lost his appeal over his failure to pay the order, and so would remain in prison.BBC News: Curtis Warren loses appeal over ¬£198m order In 2020 a prison officer was jailed for intimate relations with him.Prison officer jailed for Curtis Warren affair - BBC News Notes References *Barnes, Tony; Richard Elias; Peter Walsh. 2003 Cocky: the rise and fall of Curtis Warren, Britain's biggest drug baron 1963 births Living people 20th-century British criminals 21st-century British criminals British bank robbers British expatriates in the Netherlands British people convicted of drug offences British people of Portuguese descent English drug traffickers English mobsters English people convicted of assault English people convicted of manslaughter English prisoners and detainees British people convicted of burglary British people convicted of robbery People from Toxteth Inmates of HM Prison Belmarsh Prisoners and detainees of Jersey Prisoners and detainees of the Netherlands Criminals from Merseyside ","title":"Curtis Warren"},{"id":"4296826","text":"Philip Brown (born March 26, 1958) is an American actor probably best known for his performances on television.

One of the most important East Anglian monasteries, Thetford Priory was founded in 1103 by Roger Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, and dedicated to Our Lady. In the 13th century, the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a vision to locals requesting the addition to the site of a Lady Chapel. During its construction, the old statue of her on the site was discovered to have a hollow in its head concealing saints' relics, and became a magnet for pilgrims. Description It housed the tombs of the Howard dynasty, of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, and of other early Tudor Dynasty officials. Even this could not save the priory from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and, on its closure in 1540 (it was one of the last priories to be dissolved), the Howard tombs were removed to St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham. Its ruins (including the lower walls of the church and cloister, along with the impressive shell of the priors' lodging and, reached by a pathway from the main site, an almost complete 14th-century gatehouse) are open to the public as an English Heritage site.

It inhabits forests in Indonesia and Malaysia. Description Spotted-winged fruit bats are unusually small megabats, with a head-body length of , a wingspan of , and an adult body weight of around . Most of the head and body are covered in thick blackish-brown fur, while the underparts are a pale grey-brown. Their wings are dark brown, with distinctive pale cream spots, which are most noticeable on the joints, but are also found in a variable pattern across the wing membranes. The wings have been reported to have an aspect ratio of 5.8 and a wing loading of 9.51 N/m2. There are also pale markings in front of the large eyes, and on the ears, which are simple in shape, compared with those of microbats. The nostrils are elongated, and splayed to the side of the snout. The species can be distinguished from other small fruit bats by the presence of the spots on its wings, but also by its unusual dental formula of . Distribution and habitat Spotted-winged fruit bats inhabit primary rain forest up to elevation, and coastal mangrove forests. They are found across Malaysia and Brunei, and in the northern and western parts of the island of Borneo in Indonesia. At the edges of their range, they have also been reported from Trang Province in southern Thailand, from a small area in Sumatra, and from the Riau Archipelago. No subspecies are known. Behaviour and biology Spotted-winged fruit bats forage in the understory of dense forest where they feed on a range of generally small, inconspicuous fruit, such as figs and persimmon, and on some insects and spiders. They spend the day roosting alone or in small groups consisting of a male and up to nine females and their young. Rather than remaining with a single male, females may visit up to three different males. Males return regularly to their roosts during the night, suggesting that they gain access to females by controlling and defending prime roosting sites. They forage as individuals, rather than in a group, and rarely travel more than from their roost site. They have been observed to make high- pitched \\"peep\\" noises when foraging, as well as more complex series of sounds when socialising. Roosts are of a consistent shape and size, and may be partially excavated by the bats, a behaviour that is otherwise unknown in this group of animals. They are generally located in the root masses of epiphytic plants, such as ferns, and also in the nests of ants and termites. Females give birth to a single young up to twice a year, typically between June and January. The young are born blind, and weighing around , after a gestation of 135 days. They are weaned by 40‚Äì80 days, and are able to fly by the time they have reached in weight. Females are sexually mature at ten months of age.

It includes several notable Christian artists, including Matthew Ward, Kelly Willard, and Bob Dylan playing harmonica. Not for Sale This album marked a turning point in Green's career when he realized his principles would no longer allow him to charge money for albums. In 1979, after negotiating a release from his contract with Sparrow, Green initiated a new policy of refusing to charge money for concerts or albums. Keith and Melody mortgaged their home to privately finance the album. The album was offered through mail-order and at concerts for whatever price the recipient was willing to pay. As of May 1982, Green had shipped out more than 200,000 units of his album‚Äì61,000 for free. Green continued this policy for the remainder of his career. :\\"Keith Green has just recorded a new album, and it will not be available for sale in bookstores or through any of the usual commercial outlets. Pretty Good Records has been given the exclusive right by Keith to give the album away to anyone for whatever they can afford to give in return :\\"The whole reason for not charging a set price for the album is simple: We want everyone, no matter how much they have (even if it's nothing), to be able to hear the ministry of new life in Jesus that springs forth from this powerfully anointed album. : \\"At Last Days, we have always had a burden for the poor.

Some have warned us that there will be those who will just use the to 'get a free album'.

Gameplay The game starts with the player assuming the role of an unnamed homeless vagrant living in a fictional city, divided into four sections, titled North, South, West, and East. The player begins in the South section. To complete the game the player must accumulate $1,000,000 cash by progressing from the life of a vagrant, cleaning up by getting a haircut, securing odd jobs, attending High School, College, and eventually becoming a millionaire. Money is collected by finding dimes and $1 notes on the street and taking up employment. Bottles can also be found and exchanged for money at several stores. Movement within the city is within a scrolling two-dimensional landscape containing non-interactive pedestrians and foes. A subway system with an entrance in each section of the city allows the player to travel between sections of the city. Before travel, the player must purchase a ticket, with a maximum of five tickets able to be held at any one time. An alcohol, food/rest, and two education meters indicate the player's current status. If both the alcohol level and food/rest level reach zero, the player dies and the game ends. Restaurants, fast food outlets, and convenience stores offer the player nourishment, with price depending on the establishment; there is also a soup kitchen in which a filling meal is available for free. Some stores have limited opening hours displayed on store windows and others are open at all hours. At night, it is usually advisable that the player find accommodation such as a hotel room, ranging in price from $2 per night to $40 per week; the food/rest levels deplete twice as fast during night time. When an accommodation is pre-paid, the player leaves his hat \\"at home\\". Drinking alcohol is an inexpensive means of staying alive; however, the player cannot gain employment while affected. Both education meters, High School and College, require three visits to complete. There are no icons or indications that show the player has a diploma or degree though, it is simply implied when the meter is full. High School is free to attend, however University requires a $100 tuition payment with each visit. Both are situated in EAST city. Shops and institutions located throughout the city can be entered for special purposes including purchasing alcohol or food, attending school and work, obtaining a haircut and travelling the subway. Besides staying alive, the key focus in the game is accumulating money. The amount of currency possessed by the player is shown in three areas. The majority is represented in a green dollar readout at the bottom of the screen. However, that only shows multiples of $10. The balance of currency (dollars and dimes) are represented in unary notation. Up to nine dollar bills and up to nine dimes are shown, representing how many the player holds. Ten dimes are automatically converted into a dollar bill, and a tenth dollar bill results in the equivalent amount being moved to the green dollar readout section. In early stages of the game, money is collected in the street. Bottles can also be collected from a junkyard and traded for money at an adjacent convenience store. Before entering the junkyard the player is required to purchase dog bones to appease a guard dog. In late stages of the game, the player can make investments in increments of $10,000. Once an investment is made, the money is removed from game play, aside from the generous 20% interest paid every morning. However, investments don't count towards winning the game. Robbers carrying guns steal any dollar bills you are currently holding (but not dimes or larger amounts). IRS agents take all money the player is currently carrying in the game, except for dollar bills and dimes. Police arrest the player for not having a recent haircut. (A haircut is also a precondition for employment.) On the fifth day the player's facial hair regrows, requiring another haircut. If arrested, the player is transferred to the City Jail in the South End for a brief period, which can be inconvenient. The four sections of the city have each their purpose: South - initial survival. West - get a haircut and a job. East - get an education. North - make your money grow. The music in the game is taken from the theme in the first movement of Mozart's Trio for Piano, Clarinet and Viola in E flat major (K498).

The name Zechstein was formerly also used as a unit of time in the geologic timescale, but nowadays it is only used for the corresponding sedimentary deposits in Europe. The Zechstein lies on top of the Rotliegend; on top of the Zechstein is the Buntsandstein or Bunter. Formation The evaporite rocks of the Zechstein formation were laid down by the Zechstein Sea, an epicontinental or epeiric sea that existed in the Guadalupian and Lopingian epochs of the Permian period. The Zechstein Sea occupied the region of what is now the North Sea, plus lowland areas of Britain and the north European plain through Germany and Poland. At times the Zechstein Sea may have connected with the Paleotethys Ocean through southeastern Poland; the point is disputed by researchers. Though situated at the time near the equator (where high temperatures and arid conditions facilitated evaporation), the sea's inception likely stemmed from a marine transgression rooted in a phase of de-glaciation; the southern portion of Pangaea, the former (and future) Gondwanaland, supported ice sheets in the early Permian. The eventual disappearance of the Zechstein Sea was part of a general marine regression that preceded and accompanied the Permian-Triassic extinction.Glennie, Kenneth William, ed.

Encyclopedia of European and Asian Regional Geology. London, Chapman & Hall, 1997; pp. 97, 263. Stratigraphy The Zechstein is usually given the status of a lithostratigraphic group and as such encompasses a number of geologic formations. It consists of at least five depositional cycles of evaporite rocks, which are labelled Z1 to Z5, respectively. The lithologies found are halite (\\"rock salt\\"), anhydrite, dolomite, and shale. Zechstein Sea shown on a map of Northern Europe Economic importance The Zechstein has significant economic importance in the North Sea Oil province. In the southern gas basin, it forms the main cap rock to the gas fields with Rotliegend reservoirs. It also forms a reservoir in the Auk oilfield in the central part of the North Sea. Further north, the Zechstein salt becomes diapiric, forming salt domes which form the structure for several oil fields, such as Machar. Zechstein dolomites crop out near the coast of County Durham, England where they are known as the Magnesian Limestone. Just above the base of the Zechstein formation is a fairly thin layer of shale, or slate, where it has been metamorphized, known as the kupferschiefer for its high copper content. In its unmodified form, this layer is high in sulfur compounds that are typical of silt deposited in stagnant shallow marshland. Where faults have allowed mineral-rich groundwater to circulate through this layer, the sulfur has oxidized metal ions to metallic sulfide ores. From the Middle Ages into the modern era, this thin but widely dispersed constellation of ore bodies has been of immense importance as a source of copper across much of northern Europe. The Zechstein salt layer is also used for underground gas storage in England, Germany and France.

In general, noise refers to unwanted sound, but in audio systems it is the low-level hiss or buzz that intrudes on quiet passages that is of most interest. All recordings will contain some background noise that was picked up by microphones, such as the rumble of air conditioning, or the shuffling of an audience, but in addition to this, every piece of equipment which the recorded signal subsequently passes through will add a certain amount of electronic noise, which ideally should be so low as possible to contribute insignificantly to what is heard.  Origins of noise - the need for Weighting  Microphones, amplifiers and recording systems all add some electronic noise to the signals passing through them, generally described as hum, buzz or hiss. All buildings have low-level magnetic and electrostatic fields in and around them emanating from mains supply wiring, and these can induce hum into signal paths, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz (depending on the country's electrical supply standard) and lower harmonics. Shielded cables help to prevent this, and on professional equipment where longer interconnections are common, balanced signal connections (most often with XLR or phone connectors) are usually employed. Hiss is the result of random signals, often arising from the random motion of electrons in transistors and other electronic components, or the random distribution of oxide particles on analog magnetic tape. It is predominantly heard at high frequencies, sounding like steam or compressed air. Attempts to measure noise in audio equipment as RMS voltage, using a simple level meter or voltmeter, do not produce useful results; a special noise-measuring instrument is required. This is because noise contains energy spread over a wide range of frequencies and levels, and different sources of noise have different spectral content. For measurements to allow fair comparison of different systems they must be made using a measuring instrument that responds in a way that corresponds to how we hear sounds. From this, three requirements follow. Firstly, it is important that frequencies above or below those that can be heard by even the best ears are filtered out and ignored by bandwidth limiting (usually 22 Hz to 22 kHz). Secondly, the measuring instrument should give varying emphasis to different frequency components of the noise in the same way that our ears do, a process referred to as ‚Äòweighting‚Äô. Thirdly, the rectifier or detector that is used to convert the varying alternating noise signal into a steady positive representation of level should take time to respond fully to brief peaks to the same extent that our ears do; it should have the correct ‚Äòdynamics‚Äô. The proper measurement of noise therefore requires the use of a specified method, with defined measurement bandwidth and weighting curve, and rectifier dynamics. The two main methods defined by current standards are A-weighting and ITU-R 468(formerly known as CCIR weighting).  A-weighting  A-weighting uses a weighting curve based on ‚Äòequal-loudness contours‚Äô that describe our hearing sensitivity to pure tones, but it turns out that the assumption that such contours would be valid for noise components was wrong. While the A-weighting curve peaks by about 2dB around 2 kHz, it turns out that our sensitivity to noise peaks by some 12dB at 6 kHz. Another weakness of A-weighting is that it is usually combined with an rms (root mean square) rectifier, which measures mean power, with no attempt made to account for proper hearing dynamics.  ITU-R 468 weighting  right When measurements started to be used in reviews of consumer equipment in the late 1960s it became apparent that they did not always correlate with what was heard. In particular, the introduction of Dolby B noise-reduction on cassette recorders was found to make them sound a full 10dB less noisy, yet they did not measure 10dB better. Various new methods were then devised, including one which used a harsher weighting filter and a quasi-peak rectifier, defined as part of the German DIN45 500 ‚ÄòHi Fi‚Äô standard. This standard, no longer in use, attempted to lay down minimum performance requirements in all areas for ‚ÄòHigh Fidelity‚Äô reproduction. The introduction of FM radio, which also generates predominantly high-frequency hiss, also showed up the unsatisfactory nature of A-weighting, and the BBC Research Department undertook a research project to determine which of several weighting filter and rectifier characteristics gave results that were most in line with the judgment of panel of listeners, using a wide variety of different types of noise. BBC Research Department Report EL-17 formed the basis of what became known as CCIR recommendation 468, which specified both a new weighting curve and a quasi-peak rectifier. This became the standard of choice for broadcasters worldwide, and it was also adopted by Dolby, for measurements on its noise-reduction systems which were rapidly becoming the standard in cinema sound, as well as in recording studios and the home. Though they represent what we truly hear, ITU-R 468 noise weighting gives figures that are typically some 11dB worse than A-weighted, a fact that brought resistance from marketing departments reluctant to put worse specifications on their equipment than the public had been used to. Dolby tried to get round this by introducing a version of their own called CCIR- Dolby which incorporated a 6dB shift into the result (and a cheaper average reading rectifier), but this only confused matters, and was very much disapproved of by the CCIR. With the demise of the CCIR, the 468 standard is now maintained as ITU-R 468, by the International Telecommunications Union, and forms part of many national and international standards, in particular by the IEC (International Electrotechnical commission), and the BSI (British Standards Institute). It is the only way to measure noise, that allows fair comparisons; and yet the flawed A-weighting has made a comeback in the consumer field recently, for the simple reason that it gives the lower figures that are considered more impressive by marketing departments.  Signal to noise ratio and Dynamic range  Audio equipment specifications tend to include the terms ‚Äòsignal to noise ratio‚Äô and ‚Äòdynamic range‚Äô, both of which have multiple definitions, sometimes treated as synonyms. The exact meaning must be specified along with the measurement. = Analog = Dynamic range used to mean the difference between maximum level and noise level, with maximum level defined as a clipping signal with a specified THD+N. The term has become corrupted by a tendency to refer to the dynamic range of CD players as meaning the noise level on a blank recording with no dither, (in other words, just the analog noise content at the output). This is not particularly useful; especially since many CD players incorporate automatic muting in the absence of signal. Since the early 1990s various writers such as Julian Dunn have suggested that dynamic range be measured in the presence of a low-level test signal. Thus, any spurious signals caused by the test signal or distortion will not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio. \\"Dynamic range is a signal-to-noise measurement over the specified bandwidth made with a -60 dBFS signal. 60 dB is then added to the resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full scale. This technique ensures that the distortion components are below the noise level and do not affect the measurement.\\" This also addresses concerns about muting circuits. = Digital = In 1999, Dr. Steven Harris & Clif Sanchez Cirrus Logic published a white paper titled \\"Personal Computer Audio Quality Measurements\\" stating: In 2000 the AES released AES Information Document 6id-2000 which defined dynamic range as \\"20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the full-scale signal to the r.m.s. noise floor in the presence of signal, expressed in dB FS\\" with the following note:  See also  *Audio quality measurement *Distortion measurement *Noise *Sound level meter *ITU-R 468 noise weighting *Noise measurement *Headroom *Weighting filter *Equal-loudness contour *Fletcher-Munson curves  References  External links *Noise measurement briefing Audio electronics Broadcast engineering Sound measurements ","title":"Audio noise measurement"},{"id":"4296921","text":"The black-capped fruit bat (Chironax melanocephalus) is a species of megabat in the monotypic genus Chironax. Distribution Seven specimens of C. melanocephalus were collected from the lowland forest at Kubah and Lambir, and beach forest at Samunsam, Sarawak, Borneo. The specimen that was mist-netted in Kubah National Park on 12 July 1995 was a first record for Sarawak (Abdullah et al. 1997). According to Payne et al. (1985) the distribution of C. melanocephalus in Borneo is only known from Sepilok in Sabah and Temburong in Brunei. The range includes Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java and Sulawesi (Payne et al. 1985). Biology and ecology The habitat where it was caught was lowland mixed dipterocarp forest. Two specimens were caught in the understory of primary dipterocarp forest in Kubah National Park; one from the understory of mixed beach forest habitat in Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary; and four from the canopy (between 15 and 30 m) of the primary dipterocarp forest in Lambir Hills National Park. These sites are new distributional records for C. melanocephalus in Sarawak and have extended the range of the species to the western part of Borneo. The bat normally roosts in small groups in tree ferns and in shallow caves (Payne et al. 1985). All C. melanocephalus caught were adults, three males and four females. Two were in non-reproductive condition and others were in various reproductive stages. A female (MTA96041) caught on 21 May 1996 from Kubah was pregnant. In November 1996, two females caught in Lambir Hills National Park were in post-lactating condition, suggesting recent detachment or loss of juveniles. A male caught at the same site was observed to have enlarged testes. Medway (1978) recorded pregnant females in February and April in the upland area of Cameron highlands in Peninsular Malaysia.

M. minimus is one of the smallest species in the family Pteropodidae, with an average length of 60‚Äì85 mm. It has a reddish-brown colouring with relatively long hair compared to the other species. The hair on the abdomen is a lighter colour, and a dark brown stripe runs bilaterally down the top of the head and back.  Distribution  M. minimus represents about 14% of the total fruit bats. Its wide geographical range includes Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, southern Philippines, Java, Borneo, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and northern Australia. In Borneo, it had been recorded from Kota Kinabalu, Sepilok, Sukau, and Tawau in Sabah; Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei; Bario, Niah and Bako in Sarawak; Gunung Kenepi, Kutai, and Sungai Tengah in Kalimantan. M. minimus has not been recorded in colonies, which suggest they live in small groups or alone. It feeds on nectar and pollen, which it can obtain from mangroves and banana flowers in Malaysia. Ecologically, the long-tongued nectar bat plays a major role as pollinator of many trees, including the families Bignoniaceae, Bombacaceae, Leguminosae, Musaceae, Myrtaceae, and Sonneratiaceae in peninsular Malaysia. M. minimus has been recorded at elevations up to 1000 m near coastal mangroves, in dipterocarp forests, and in lower montane forests.  Biology  Of total captures, males constituted 53% and females 47%. About 77% were adults. Sexually active males have enlarged testes, and polyestrous females have a breeding period of 140 to 160 days. Estimates for the gestation period for M. minimus is approximately 120 days (¬± 10 days), lactation occurs for 60 to 70 days. In Negros Island, Philippines, females studies produced two or three young per year. The species reproduces aseasonally (throughout the year) and synchronously in response to food abundance. = External measurements = For young bats, the forearm grows at 0.24 mm per day and weight is gained at gain 0.07 g per day. A free- flying immature bat has an forearm length 35.2 mm and weighs around 8.6 g. The length of the head and body in adults is 60‚Äì85 mm (with the head being 26‚Äì28 mm in length), the length of the forearm is 40‚Äì43 mm, and the weight is 12‚Äì18 g.

It is one of 10 species in the genus Rousettus. Distribution Geoffroy's rousette occurs throughout Southeast Asia and in the Malesia region of Oceania, in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, the island of Borneo, East Timor, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, and Papua New Guinea. Description Like other fruit bats, R. amplexicaudatus has sensitive hearing and sense of smell and good eyesight which helps it to manoeuvre well during flight, specifically at night. What makes it different from other fruit bats is its echolocating ability. It can be distinguished by its grey-brown to brown upperpart which is darker on top of the head and paler underpart which is usually grey-brown.Payne, J. & Francis, C.M. (1985). A Field Guide to the Mammals of Borneo. Sabah Society: Malaysia. p. 171. It has long pale hairs on the chin and neck despite having short and sparse fur. It sometimes has pale yellow tufts of hair on the side of its neck which occur in adult for this species, especially males. Most males are substantially larger than females. The most distinguishable figure of this bat besides producing a distinctive, audible clicking call is its wings. It is attached to the sides of the back and separated by a broad band of fur. The lower incisors are bifid, the canines have a longitudinal groove on the outer surface which is slightly medial to center, and the first premolars are smaller than second premolars, especially on the upper jaw.Bonaccorso, F.J. (1998). Bats of Papua New Guinea. Washington, D.C.: Conservation International. pp. 151-155. Biology and ecology Specimens in the Sabah Museum were collected from coconut plantations on Mantani Island and the highland of Crocker Range, while the one from Sarawak was from Niah Cave. This medium-sized bat normally roosts in caves, and feeds on fruit, nectar, and pollen.(Payne et al. 1985). It roosts dark caves, rock crevices and old tombs.(Lekagul and McNeely 1977). The Monfort Bat Cave in the southern Philippines has the largest gathering of these bats. External measurements The Sabah Museum specimens had forearm length measurements between 82.22 and 86.76 mm for the females (NH3134, NH3142, NH3144) and an adult male from Sarawak (SM016/2) was FA 81.43 mm.

Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1980 by Bergmans and Hill. The holotype had been collected in 1977 in northern Sumatra. The species name \\"spinulatus\\" is from Latin spina meaning \\"spine\\" and ala meaning \\"wing;\\" the scientific name refers to the fact that the wings insert along the spine rather than the sides of the body, which is unique in the genus Rousettus. Description It is a small megabat with a cone-shaped snout. Its face has a number of small warts on its chin, around its mouth, and between its upper lip and eyes. Its wings are short and broad. Its forearm length is approximately . Individuals weigh . Biology It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves. They navigate and potentially locate food resources using a primitive form of echolocation. They create high-pitched buzzing calls by moving the tongue against the palate. Food sources may include nectar and fruit, though it is alleged that they eat edible-nest swiftlet eggs and hatchlings, causing damage to the economically valuable nests. Range and habitat Its range includes Indonesia and Malaysia. It is found at elevations up to above sea level. Conservation As of 2008, it is evaluated as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this assessment because its population is estimated to have declined by more than 30% from 1993-2008; this decline is projected to continue.

It forms part of the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, along with the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton. It caters for most specialties. History The hospital was built on the parkland of the former St Luke's Hospital, Middlesbrough. Opened in 1980 as a tertiary care centre called South Cleveland Hospital, it later became an extensive hospital with A&E.; The hospital changed its name to the James Cook University Hospital in 2001. New facilities were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace Middlesbrough General Hospital, North Riding Infirmary and the neuro- rehabilitation unit at West Lane Hospital in 1999. These new facilities were designed by HLM Architects, built on the site by Mowlem at a cost of ¬£96 million and opened in August 2003. In May 2012, a ¬£35 million radiotherapy centre opened at the hospital, unveiled by Princess Alexandra. In November 2012, a new 3T MRI scanner was opened, in the Neurosciences department. This is a partnership between the hospital and Durham University and in addition to clinical work will undertake research into various aspects of cognition. In May 2013, the hospital became a major trauma centre for Teesside, County Durham, North Yorkshire and surrounding areas, participating in the wider Northern trauma Network. In March 2015, a new purpose-built IVF unit was opened (complete with its own theatre), it now brings all the reproductive medicine services together in one place. Facilities James Cook University Hospital specialises in the treatment of cancer, heart conditions and neurosurgery as well as housing the regional neonatal intensive care and spinal injury units. More recent developments include the introduction of advanced cardiac mapping technologies for complex radio frequency ablation, and the development of a highly successful Transcatheter Aortic Valve Intervention programme for patients deemed unfit for conventional cardiac surgery. The hospital is used to teach clinical medical students from Newcastle University Medical School as well as pre-clinical students based at Durham University's Queen's Campus Stockton enrolled on collaborative course between Newcastle University Medical School and Durham University. The hospital also has strong teaching and research links with the School of Health at Teesside University.

This index lists countries from 1 to 180 based on the level of freedom journalists have to do their job. Reporters Without Borders described Iran as \\"one of the world's most repressive countries for journalists for the past 40 years\\". In the Freedom House Index, Iran also scores low on political rights and civil liberties and is classified as \\"not free\\". Iran is one of the strongest countries in Internet censorship. The Iranian government and Islamic revolutionary Guard Sepah interested in block all social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Internet censorship in Iran and the NIN work like the Great Firewall of China with stricter monitoring and NIN was unveiled during the 2019 Iranian protests. However, Iranian politicians ordered to increase Internet censorship in Iran especially social networks like Facebook and YouTube for Iranian people but Iranian politicians mostly use it, Therefore because of internet censorship in Iran, using the internet is very unpleasant for the tourists have traveled to Iran and even the Iranian people. Beginning on 17 November 2019, in response to the 2019 Iranian protests, because of Internet censorship in Iran an internet shutdown reduced Iran Internet traffic in the country 5% of normal levels.  In practice  After the Islamic revolution in 1979, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, also known as the Ershad, came into existence to control all cultural activities in the country. From that moment on, all musicians, writers, artists and media makers needed permits that allowed them to publicly display their works. The Ershad is in charge of providing these permits and judges whether these works are in line with Islamic culture. Different departments within the Ershad are responsible for interpreting what fits and what does not fit Islamic culture and should therefore be censored. At the head of this bureaucratic organization are the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance and the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Journalists also need a license before they can legally start working. Licenses for journalists are provided by the Press Supervisory Board and will be withdrawn when journalists criticize state. Censorship here is not just an act by an individual, it‚Äôs a process which involves interaction and negotiation. The complexity and ambiguity of the system stimulate self-censorship and result into a culture of censorship. However, not everything is negotiable. Criticism on the Supreme Leader is for example strictly forbidden and journalists or artists who do not obey to the Iranian state, can face serious punishments. = Laws and regulations = The Iranian constitution contains many laws which restrict the flow of information. However, these laws are often ambiguous and vaguely worded. This thin legal basis leaves a lot of room for interpretation about what is legal and what is not. Censorship regulation is therefore a highly subjective practice. It depends on the interpretation of the individual bureaucrat in charge whether censorship will be applied or not. These laws can therefore easily be used by government officials who want to suppress dissenting voices. What the Iranian constitution doesn't do is protecting journalists and artists by giving them rights. The Iranian constitution states very general rules concerning freedom of expression. For Iranian citizens it's not always clear what is allowed by the government and what is not. Article 24 states: \\"Publications and the press have freedom of expression except when it is detrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam or the rights of the public. The details of this exception will be specified by law\\". So far, there exists no law which specifies the details of this exception. Article 3 of The Press Law states: \\"The press have the right to publish the opinions, constructive criticisms, suggestions and explanations of individuals and government officials for public information while duly observing the Islamic teachings and the best interest of the community\\". The first part of this law describes a lot of freedoms for the press but in the second part this freedom is restricted by very broad exceptions. Anything can be labeled as against \\"the interest of the community\\" and therefore the press should always be careful. Article 500 of the penal code states: \\"Anyone who engages in any type of propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran or in support of opposition groups and associations, shall be sentenced to three months to one year of imprisonment\\". But nowhere can be found what is seen as propaganda and what is not. This vagueness gives judges a lot of room for interpreting what is against the law and should therefore be punished.  History  Iran has a long history with censorship. Especially reactive measures where information in newspapers, on television or on the internet is withhold from the public have been present for ages. These forms of censorship were used for suppression of opposition and for influencing of public opinion. Censorship in Iran comes in waves which exist parallel to political crises. In situations of crisis, the state tries to get power back by controlling information streams and thereby denying opposition groups influence on the public debate. During the crisis that followed the nationalization of the oil industry in the 1950s, censorship was intensified to protect the Shah‚Äôs reputation. During the 1970s, in the years preceding the revolution, censorship was less present in the Iranian society. This created big developments in Iranian literature production. However, in the years after the revolution censorship intensified again. The new Islamic leaders tried to consolidate their power by enforcing new regulations. And lastly, in the crisis after the 2009 elections, communication channels were shutdown to prevent major uprisings.  Subject matter and agenda  =Political= Censorship in Iran is largely seen as a measure to maintain the stability of the country. Censorship helps prevent unapproved reformist, counter-revolutionary, or religious proponents, peaceful or otherwise, from organizing themselves and spreading their ideals. In 2007, for example, five women were charged with \\"endangering national security\\" and sentenced to prison for collecting over a million signatures supporting the abolishment of laws discriminating against women. Some of the topics explicitly banned from discussion in the media by the Supreme National Security Council include Iran's economic troubles, the possibility of new international sanctions targeted at Iran's nuclear program, negotiations with the United States regarding Iraq, social taboos, unrest among Iran's ethnic minorities, and the arrests in 2007 of Haleh Esfandiari, Kian Tajbakhsh and Ali Shakeri.Iran, Annual Report 2007 Reporters Without Borders =Media= Two notable crackdowns on the Iranian press occurred on 7‚Äì11 August 1979, early in the Islamic Revolution when the Khomeini forces were consolidating control and dozens of non-Islamist newspapers were banned under a new press law banning \\"counter-revolutionary policies and acts.\\"Schirazi, The Constitution of Iran, Tauris, 1997 p.51 Despite a ban on satellite television, dishes dot many Iranian rooftops and people have access to dozens of Persian-language channels, including the Voice of America, broadcasting a daily dose of politics and entertainment. 30 percent of Iranians watch satellite channels, but observers say the figures are likely to be higher.Media and internet Yahoo! A number of unauthorised foreign radio services also broadcast into Iran on shortwave, and encounter occasional jamming by the Iranian government due to their controversial nature. Such services include a popular phone-in programme from Kol Israel (Voice of Israel), where callers must dial a number in Europe to be rerouted to the studio in Israel in order to protect against persecution for communicating with an enemy state.\\"Listening to Iran\\" Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (2008) In March 2009, Amoo Pourang (Uncle Pourang), an Iranian children television show watched by millions of Iranian children three times a week on state TV was pulled off after a child appearing on the program called his pet monkey \\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\", live on air. In September 2017, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the Iranian judicial system and intelligence services (VEVAK) for their attempts to put pressure on Iranian journalists based abroad and on their families still in Iran in order to influence the Persian-language sections of international media outlets such as BBC Persian service to broadcast pro government programs and news.  Internet  In the first decade of the 21st century, Iran experienced a great surge in Internet usage, and, with 20 million people on the Internet, currently has the second highest percentage of its population online in the Middle East, after Israel. When initially introduced, the Internet services provided by the government within Iran were comparatively open. Many users saw the Internet as an easy way to get around Iran's strict press laws.Feuilherade, P. (2002.) \\"Iran's banned press turns to the net\\" . BBC.com. Retrieved 9 December 2006.BBC News. (2003.) \\"Iran Steps Up Net Censorship\\" . BBC. Retrieved 9 December 2006. In recent years, Internet service providers have been told to block access to pornographic and anti-religion websites. The ban has also targeted gaming platforms such as Steam as well as popular social networking sites as Facebook and YouTube, alongside some news websites. Internet usage has also been shut down country-wide to limit the organization of protests. The Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Sepah are always blocking popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter and more. But they decided to shut down the Internet during the protests in Iran in 2019. Many internet businesses were shut down during 2019‚Äì20 Iranian Protest.  Banned media  In 2010, Iranian government began using cropping and other editing techniques to censor foreign movies deemed offensive or immoral. The thought behind this was that citizens would stop seeking out illegal, uncensored versions if approved versions of the films were broadcast. Censorship cut out the following: alcoholic beverages, sorcery, men and women sitting too closely together or touching, closeups of women's faces, low necklines on shirts, and many others. People are sometimes edited out or objects are strategically placed to cover what is considered inappropriate. For example, a low neckline on a woman's shirt is edited to be more modest. Dialogue in foreign films is often rewritten. For example, romantic implications are replaced with marriage proposals. = Books = *The Satanic Verses *Memories of My Melancholy Whores =Films= *The Circle *Crimson Gold *Half Moon *Offside *Persepolis (film) *Tcherike-ye Tara *Ten *Santouri *Marmoulak *Time of Love *300 =Video games= *Battlefield 3 *ARMA 3 *1979 Revolution: Black Friday =Religious= The agents of censorship are sometimes not official government employees, but religious organizations.

Panchala in the Mahabharata  = Geography = The Panchala kingdom (Mahabharata) extends from the Himalayas in the north; to the Charmanwati river; with the Kuru, Surasena and Matsya kingdoms to the west; and the Naimisha Forest to the east. Later, Panchala was divided into Southern Panchala (\\"Panchala proper\\", centered at Kampilya, ruled by King Drupada, the father-in-law of Pandavas); and Northern Panchala (centered at Ahichatra, ruled by Ashwathama, the son of Drona.

Many other sons of Drupada (a total of 10) and other Panchala princes (like Yudhamanyu, Uttamaujas, JanamejayaKisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 82. etc.) were allied with the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. = Origin of Panchala Kingdom = The lineage extending from King Puru, son of King Yayati to Santanu. The following passage from Mahabharata, that describes the Puru lineage of kings, shows the kinship of the Kurus and the Panchalas, both branched from the same line: \\"When Janamejaya wished to hear the history of kings who were descended from Puru. Vaisampayana narrated the lineage of kings in Puru‚Äôs line.\\".Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 94. = Lineage of the Puru Kings up to the Panchala Kingdom = Puru had by his wife, Paushti, three sons: Pravira, Iswara, and Raudraswa. Pravira (perpetuator of the dynasty) had by his wife, Suraseni, a son Manasyu. Manasyu had by his wife, Sauviri, three sons: Sakta, Sahana, and Vagmi. Raudraswa had by his wife, Apsara Misrakesi, ten sons (all who had sons): Richeyu, Kaksreyu, Vrikeyu, Sthandileyu, Vaneyu, Jaleyu, Tejeyu, Satyeyu, Dharmeyu and Sannateyu. Richeyu, as Anadhrishti, succeeded them all. Anadhristi had a son, Matinara, the latter who was well-regarded and virtuous as king and performed the Rajasuya and the Ashwamedha. Matinara had four sons: Tansu, Mahan, Atiratha, and Druhyu. Tansu (perpetuator of the Puru line) had a son, Ilina. Ilina had by his wife, Rathantara, five sons: Dushyanta, Sura, Bhima, Pravasu, and Vasu; Dushyanta succeeded as king. Dushyanta had by his wife, Sakuntala, an intelligent son who succeeded as Emperor Bharata. It is the name of the latter that is applied to the race of which he was the founder. Bharata had with his three wives nine sons but he was not pleased with any of them. Bharata performed a great sacrifice and through the grace of Bharadwaja obtained a son, Bhumanyu, who was made his heir-apparent. Bhumanyu had by his wife: Pushkarini, six sons: Suhotra, Suhotri, Suhavih, Sujeya, Diviratha and Kichika. Suhotra, described as having a virtuous reign, had by his wife, Aikshaki, three sons: Ajamidha, Sumidha, and Purumidha. Ajamidha succeeded them all. Ajamidha's son was Nila. The dynasty of Ajamidha stands as: # = War between Panchalas and the forefathers of Kurus = The outcome of warring between the Kurus and Panchalas led the Kurus being exiled to the banks of the Sindhu. Riksha became king being the elder of Jala and Rupina. Riksha had a son, Samvarana, the latter the perpetrator of the royal line. During the reign of Samvarana, there was a great loss of people by famine, pestilence, drought, and disease. The king of the Panchalas invaded during this time with four kinds of troops and ten Akshauhinis. Samvarana was exiled with his family and government in the forest along the Sindhu or Tapati river, the latter which extended to the foot of the western mountains. There the Bharatas lived for a thousand years. Samvarana had with his wife, Tapati (?) (the daughter of Surya, a king of the Solar Dynasty), a son Kuru. Then one day the sage Vasishtha, having become the priest, approached the exiled Bharata and made him the sovereign of the Kshatriyas. The king retook his old capital made all the monarchs pay tribute to him. Kuru was exceedingly virtuous, and was made king by his people, the founding of the Kuru dynasty and the Kuru Kingdom. The field called Kurujangala is named after him and is where after becoming devoted to asceticism, he there practiced asceticism. The sages in the line of Vasistha, were the priests of the Solar Dynasty of kings for many generations, especially the Ikshwakus. It is speculated that is why Samvarana took Vasistha as his priest, married from the Solar Dynasty. The history of Samvarana falling in love with Tapati while he lived near the Tapati river) was with the help of Maharashtra and Vasistha in getting the consent to marry from her father king SuryaKisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 173, 174, 175, 176. = Drupada becomes the king of Panchala = The King Prishata of Northern Panchala, a great friend of Bharadwaja, had a son, named Drupada. Drupada would come every day to the hermitage of Bharadwaja to play and study with Drona. Prishata died, Drupada succeeded him as the king and then repudiated his friendship with Drona. Drupada insulted Drona by saying that Drona was not a king, but a poor Brahmana.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna- Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1: Adi Parva, Ch. 131: The History of Drona = Partition of the Panchala Kingdom = Drona defeated Drupada, by means of his disciple Arjuna and the other Kuru princes, to settle his old scores. Drona spoke as follows to the captive Drupada:- > Thou toldest me before that none who was not a king could be a king‚Äôs > friend. Therefore is it, O Yajnasena (Drupada), that I retain half thy > kingdom. Thou art the king of all the territory lying on the southern side > of the Bhagirathi (Ganga), while I become king of all the territory on the > north of that river.

Other tribes imitated the practices of these tribes and thus got accepted into the Vedic religions: > Commencing with the Panchalas, the Kauravas, the Naimishas (a forest-country > to the east of Panchala), the Matsyas, all these, know what religion is.

It was ruled by Kichaka clan of kings. They belonged to the Suta caste (offspring of Kshatriyas upon Brahmana ladies). One among the Kichakas was the commander-in-chief of the Matsya army under king Virata. Pandava Bhima slew Kichaka because of the latter's abuse towards the wife of Pandavas, viz Draupadi. Kichaka kingdom also lied to the east of the Matsya Kingdom under the rule of king Virata. It seems that this territory was allied to both the Matsyas and Panchalas, with its own independent rulers. Its capital was Vetrakiya, on the banks of river Vetravati (Betwa), also known as Suktimati. = The town named Ekachakra = It is believed that the Pandavas lived in a small town named Ekachakra, belonging to this territory, during their wanderings after Duryodhana attempted to murder them at Varanavata (a Kuru city). In the course of their wanderings the Pandavas saw the countries of the Matsyas, the Trigartas, the Panchalas and the Kichakas, and also many beautiful woods and lakes therein. They all had matted locks on their heads and were attired in barks of trees and the skins of animals. They attired in the garbs of ascetics. They used to study the Rik and the other Vedas and also all the Vedangas as well as the sciences of morals and politics. Finally they met Vyasa. He told them:- Not far off before you is a delightful town. Saying this he led them into the town of Ekachakra. on arriving at Ekachakra, the Pandavas lived for a short time in the abode of a Brahmana, leading an eleemosynary life.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 159. During this period, Bhima slew a Rakhsasa named Baka (Vaka), at Vetrakiya controlled the affairs of the Kichaka Kingdom and freed that kingdom from Baka's reign of terror.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 165-166.  Pandavas journey from Ekachakra to Kampilya  Pandavas proceeded towards Panchala with their mother, to attend the self-choice event of princess Draupadi. In order to reach their destination, they proceeded in a due northerly direction, walking day and night till they reached a sacred shrine of Siva with the crescent mark on his brow. Then those tigers among men, the sons of Pandu, arrived at the banks of the Ganges. It was a forest called Angaraparna. Here, they encountered a Gandharva named Angaraparna.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 172. After that encounter they went to a place called Utkochaka, where they met sage Dhaumya. They appointed Dhaumya, the younger brother of Devala, as their priest.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 185. Then they proceeded towards the country of the southern Panchalas ruled over by the king Drupada They proceeded by slow stages staying for some time within those beautiful woods and by fine lakes that they beheld along their way and entered the capital of the Panchalas. Beholding the capital (Kampilya), as also the fort, they took up their quarters in the house of a potter. Desirous of beholding the Swayamvara (self-choice ceremony of the princess), the citizens, roaring like the sea, all took their seats on the platforms that were erected around the amphitheatre. The kings from diverse countries entered the grand amphitheatre by the north-eastern gate. And the amphitheatre which itself had been erected on an auspicious and level plain to the north-east of Drupada's capital, was surrounded by beautiful mansions. And it was enclosed on all sides with high walls and a moat with arched doorways here and there. The Pandavas, too, entering that amphitheatre, sat with the Brahmanas and beheld the unequalled affluence of the king of the Panchalas.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 187. \\"Arjuna won the competition set for winning Draupadi in the self-choice ceremony\\".Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose\\", 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 192.  Kanyakubja Kingdom  This kingdom is identified to be the modern day Kannauj district of Uttar Pradesh. During the reign of King Drupada of southern Panchala, this territory formed a part of the southern Panchala Gadhi, born in the race of king Kusika and Gadhi's son Viswamitra, were earlier rulers of this kingdom.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 176. Gadhi's daughter was married to Richika (could be related to the Rishikas in the north), belonging to the Bhargava clan. Richika's son was Jamadagni and Jamadagni's son was the celebrated Bhargava Rama. Gadhi mentions to Richika about a custom followed by their race, that during marriage, that the bridegroom should give to the bride side a dower of 3000 fleet steeds with brown color. (This custom is similar to that of Madra Culture.) Richika get the horses from Varuna (Varuna is indicative of western cultures. Note that Arjuna also got his excellent chariot, horses and bow from Varuna). The horses reached Kanyakubja capital, crossing the river Ganges. The spot where they crossed the river was known by the name horse's landing place.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 3, Ch. 115. Not far from Kanyakubja, a spot in the sacred bank of the Ganges is still famous among men as Aswatirtha in consequence of the appearance of those horses at that place.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 13, Ch. 4. Both the Kusikas and the Bhargava-Richikas seems to have links with the ancient western-cultures (See Also: Bahlika Culture, Madra Culture, Rishika Kingdom and Rishikas). Viswamitra (Kusika's race) was born as a Kshatriya and later became a Brahmana, much like what was common in Madra Cultures. Bhargava Rama (Richika's race) was an expert in the use of the battle-axe, which he got from Kailasa region (Kailas range Tibet). The location of the Rishika tribe, who were experts in the use of battle-axes was not too distant from this region. The custom of donating or accepting horses as dowry also indicate north- western culture. It seems that neither the Bhargavas (and Richikas or Rishikas) nor the Kusikas, maintained any distinctions such as Brahmana and Kshatriya upon themselves. However, during the later periods, when the Vedic religion became rigid in its four-order caste-system, the Bhargavas were accepted as Brahmanas and the Kusikas as Kshatriyas. Gadhi was sovereign whose military force was exceedingly great.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 3, Ch. 115. Viswamitra also possessed a large army and many animals and vehicles. Using those animals and vehicles he used to roam around in forests in search of deer.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 176. During his wanderings he met the sage Vasistha. He engaged in a dispute with this sage, on the matter of the wealth of cattle possessed by the sage. (Cattle wealth always caused dispute among ancient Indian kingdoms (See the dispute between Matsyas and Trigartas for the sake of cattle wealth; in Matsya Kingdom). Viswamitra had to encounter many local-armies to seize the cattle wealth. (See Dravida Kingdom, Kerala Kingdom, Pundra Kingdom and Kirata Kingdom, Himalaya Kingdom). He was vanquished by the local-armies.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 177. After the defeat from Vasistha, Viswamitra adopted the life of an ascetic. Bhargava Rama defeated many tribes like Heheyas and later adopting the life of an ascetic. Thus both the Kusikas and Bhargava- Richikas were warrior-tribes, who also were a priest-like class of people. In the country of Panchala, there is a forest called Utpala, where Viswamitra of Kusika's race had performed sacrifices with his son.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 3, Ch. 87. = Pandavas's route from Dwiata lake to Matsya kingdom = Panchala was one among the countries considered by the Pandavas to spend their 13th year of anonymity along with the kingdoms Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salwa, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 4, Ch. 1. Pandavas selected the Matsya Kingdom for their 13th year of anonymous life. Pandavas ordered their chief servant Indrasena and the others to take with then the empty chariots and to speedily proceeded to Dwaravati. All the maid-servants of Draupadi were ordered to go to the Panchala kingdom. After that the Pandavas left Dwaita lake in the Dwaita forest and proceeded to Matsya kingdom. Dhaumya, their priest, taking their sacred fires, set out for the Panchala Kingdom.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 4, Ch. 4. Pandavas travelling eastwards, reached river Yamuna. Travelling along the southern banks of Yamuna, they passed through Yakrilloma, Surasena. Then they turned westwards (possibly to deceive the spies of Duryodhana, who might have following them), leaving behind, on their right (north side), the country of the Panchalas, and on their left (south side), that of the Dasarnas entered the Matsya Kingdom.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 4, Ch. 5. = Impact of Magadha Kings on Panchala = Due to the power of Magadha king Jarasandha, many ancient tribes had to shift their domains. Prominent among them were the Yadavas, who fled from Surasena Kingdom to south-west to Anarta Kingdom. The king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and followers, and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas also had to flee to the country of the Kuntis (which was south to these kingdoms).Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 2, Ch. 14. Even though only king Jarasandha is mentioned, this situation could have arose due to many generations of powerful Magadha kings who were forefathers of Jarasandha. During the reign of Drupada, no shift in the location of southern Panchala is mentioned explicitly. If the situation was created by Jarasandha alone, and no other Magadha kings later or earlier to him, then this shift of southern- Panchala could be temporary. = Dispute of Panchalas with Dasarnas = There arose a dispute between the Dasarna Kingdom lying to the south, and the southern-Panchala king Drupada, upon the matter of the gender of prince Shikhandi, who was married to the princess of Dasarna. = Panchala's alliance with Pandava King Yudhishthira = Bhima collected tribute for Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice during his military campaign to the east and first visited the Panchala Kingdom after leaving his home city Indraprastha.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 2, Ch. 28. only two tribes do not pay tribute unto Yudhishthira, viz., the Panchalas in consequence of their relationship by marriage, and the Andhakas and Vrishnis (Anarta Yadavas) in consequence of their friendship.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 2, Ch. 51. When the Pandavas were exiled by Duryodhana, both the Panchalas and Yadavas visited them along with other cousins like the Chedis and Kekeyas.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 3, Ch. 12. Pandavas five son's by Draupadi, spent some of their life in Panchala and some in Dwaraka during the 13-year-long exile of the Pandavas. During their pilgrimage all around India, Yudhishthira asked the weak men among his followers to go to king Dhritarashtra of Kuru Kingdom and if he didn't take care of them, then to king Drupada of southern Panchala.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 3, Ch. 92. Yudhishthira and his followers, with Matsya king Virata, began to make preparations for war (Kurukshetra War). Virata and his relatives sent word to all the monarchs, and Panchala king Drupada also did the same. And at the request of Pandavas, as also of the two kings of the Matsyas and the Panchalas, many kings gathered for their cause.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 5. Druupada sent his priest to Hastinapura for the initial peace talks.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 19-20. Drupada, the king of the Panchalas, surrounded by his ten heroic sons, Satyajit and other headed by Dhrishtadyumna, and well- protected by Shikhandi, and having furnished his soldiers with necessary things, joined the Pandavas with a full Akshauhini.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 57. = Panchalas in Kurukshetra War = Panchalas were the closest among all the allies of the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. Panchala prince Dhristadyumna was the commander-in-chief for the whole of the Pandava army. Many heroes from Panchala battled in the war. Most of them were alive till the end of the war. However all of them were slain by Ashwathama in an ambush, when they were asleep in their tents, on the last day of the war. Ashwathama was the ruler of half of the Panchala Kingdom viz the northern Panchala, under Kuru king Duryodhana. Northern Panchala was then reduced to the status of a province of the Kuru Kingdom. This could be the political factor that caused the Panchalas (southern Panchalas) to become kinsmen of the Pandavas, who were a rebel force in the Kuru Kingdom. By supporting the Pandavas in Kurukshetra War they might have sought to regain their lost Panchala territories.  Panchala heroes  Satyajit wasKisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 140. as the commander-in-chief of the Panchala army under king Drupada who fought against Arjuna who was then a disciple of Drona, the preceptor in warfare, in the Kuru Kingdom. He came to the Kurukshetra War leading the one Akshouhini of Panchala army. The brave warriors among the Panchalas, viz., Jayanta, Amitaujas and the great car- warrior Satyajit were great car-warriors (Maharathas) by Bhishma.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 172. He was slain by Drona on the 12th day of the war. The Panchala princes Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 57. were protectors of Arjuna's car-wheelsKisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 88-89. during the battle. Similarly the Panchala prince Kumara was one of the protectors of Yudhishthira's car-wheels, along with another hero Yugadhara (hailing from the city of Yugandhara, located somewhere to the west of Kurujangala (either in Haryana or Punjab). Kumara and Yugandhara were slain by Drona.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 16. Vyaghradatta was another Panchala prince slain by Drona along with Sinhasena.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 16. Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi, Janamejaya (the son of Durmuksha), Chandrasen, Madrasen, Kritavarman, Dhruva, Dhara, Vasuchandra and Sutejana were Panchala heroes, some of them being the sons of Drupada.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 155. The 10 sons of Drupada.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 57. and five sons (something off here)Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 8, Ch. 85. as in the Kurukshetra War. Suratha and Satrunjaya were sons of Drupada slain by Ashwathama.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna- Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 153 and Bk. 7, Ch. 153. Vrika and Panchalya were sons of Drupada slain by Drona. Drupada's three grandsons also were in the war.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 184. Shikhandi's son Khsatradeva was in the war.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 23. Dhristadyumna's sons, tender in year, were slain by Drona in the war.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 11, Ch. 22. Other Panchala Chiefs who died at the hands of Drona were Ketama and Vasudhana as per C.Rajagopalachari's Mahabharata. Valanika, Jayanika, Jaya, Prishdhra, and Chandrasena‚Äîthese heroes were also believed to be of Panchala, slain by Ashwathama.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna- Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 153.  The Somakas, Srinjayas and the Prabhadrakas  These three names were frequently in the story of the Kurukshetra War either as related to the Panchalas or as synonymous to the Panchalas. Srinjayas and Somakas were tribes allied to the Panchalas by kinship, born off from the various branches of the same royal lineage that brought forth the Panchala-tribe. They dwelled in the various provinces of the Panchala kingdom. Prabhadrakas seems to be an elite group of Panchala army, employed in Kurukshetra War. = The Somakas = Somaka seems to be a name used to denote all the tribes of Panchalas. The word Somaka, means the one who belonged to the Lunar Dynasty. This name could have given by rulers of Solar Dynasty. The Kosala Kingdom ruled by Solar Dynasty of kings lied to the east of Panchala. So this name could have coined by the Kosalas to denote the Panchalas. Thus the name could be collective to the whole of the Panchala tribes and specific to the tribes that lie close to Kosala, i.e. the tribes that dwell in the eastern parts of Panchala. Pancalas and Srinjayas were sometimes referred to collectively as Somakas.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 10, Ch. 8. Somakas and Panchalas were different tribes.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 175; Bk. 6, Ch. 72, 89, 99, 120; Bk. 7, Ch. 83, 123, 124, 148, 156, 157, 162, 167, 171, 184; Bk. 8, Ch. 22, 89; Bk. 9, Ch. 6, 17, 18, 21. Somakas and Srinjayas were different tribes.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 6, Ch. 15, 119; Bk. 8, Ch. 92; and Bk. 9, Ch. 20. Somakas and Prabhadrakas were different tribes.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 9, Ch. 11. The Srinjayas and the Panchalas, the Matsyas and the Somakas were separate tribes.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 158. Drona during the war said to Duryodhana: > I will not put off my armour without slaying all the Panchalas. O king, go > and tell my son Ashwathama not let the Somakas alone.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, > The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, > 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 148. Kshatradharman, a Kurukshetra War hero, belonged to the Somaka tribe; another hero was Uttamaujas belonging to the Panchala tribe.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 83. King Somaka, (1-2,127,128) is with his son Jantu.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 2, 127 and 128. King Somaka was the son of Sahadeva, and a most excellent maker of gifts and he performed a sacrifice on the banks of Yamuna. King Somaka is listed among the great kings of ancient India.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna- Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 6, Ch. 9; and Bk. 13, Ch. 76 and 115. The Somakas and Panchalas were at many of the same places. Drupada was the Somaka king and Dhristadyumna is a Somaka prince.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 123, 133; Bk. 5, Ch. 5, 22, 48, 50, 130, 141, 152, 161; Bk. 6, Ch. 1, 43, 52, 59, 75, 77, 90, 98, 104, 108, 109, 117, 119; Bk. 7, Ch. 7, 23, 92, 107, 115, 122, 143, 152, 161, 166, 170, 188, 191, 198; Bk. 8, Ch. 24, 74, 78, 82, 89, 90, 91; Bk. 9, Ch. 7, 8, 30, 56, 57, 59; and Bk. 10, Ch. 8. = The Srinjayas = Srinjaya king Hotravahana is the maternal grandfather of the Kasi princess Amba (Amva).Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 178-179. Amva, coming from Salwa stayed in the asylum of sage Saikhavatya (who dwelled on the banks of Saikavati river). Hotravahana met her granddaughter there. He was a friend of Bhargava Rama. The Panchalas and Srinjayas attacked Arjuna when he tried to make Drupada captive for the sake of Drona.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 1, Ch. 140. Uttamujas was the great Srinjaya car-warrior.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 8, Ch. 75.

Chedis the Andhakas, the Vrishnis, the Bhojas, the Kukuras and the Srinjayas were separate tribes.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna- Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 28. Here the Andhakas, Vrishinis, Bhojas and the Kukuras were tribes belonging to the Yadava clan. The Kasayas (Kasis), the Chedis, the Matsyas, the Srinjayas, the Panchalas, and the Prabhadrakas were separate tribes.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 5, Ch. 57. The Chedis, the Srinjayas, the Kasis and the Kosalas were battling together for Pandavas.Kisari Mohan Ganguli, The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose, 1883-1896, Bk. 7, Ch. 122. *A Srinjaya king is mentioned as great amongst conquerors at (1- 1). He is also mentioned at (2,8). At (7,53) Srinjaya is mentioned as the son of a king named Switya. Sinjaya's son named Suvarnashthivin was slain by some robber-tribes during his childhood. The sages Narada and Parvata (Narada's sister's son (12,30)) were Srinjaya's friends. Chapters (7- 53 to 69) describes a narration of Narada to Srinjaya, to console him in the death of his son. This is also mentioned at (12-29,30,31). *Bhishma mentions at (5,164) that he could slay the whole armies of Srinjayas and the Salweyas (Salwa lied to the west of Kuru while Panchala lied to its east). Srinjayas were mentioned as synonymous to Panchalas at many places. Refer (3- 33,35), (5- 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 48, 71, 72, 82, 93, 127, 162, 163, 168), (6- 16, 45, 59, 60, 72, 73, 74, 75, 87, 91, 99, 108, 109, 110, 115, 116, 120), (7- 2, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 33, 76, 92, 94, 107, 122, 148, 151, 152, 180, 184, 190), (8- 21, 24, 31, 35, 51, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 66, 67, 73, 75, 79, 85, 93, 94), (9- 19, 29, 33, 34, 57, 59, 61), (10,8), (11,26). *King Srinjaya is mentioned as an ally of King Jayadratha of Sindhu. (3,263). = The Prabhadrakas = Prabhadrakas seems to be an elite army obtained by Panchalas from the Kambojas. They could also be a Panchala army-unit or a Panchala tribe, that got trained in cavalry warfare by the Kambojas. At (7,23.42-43) the Prabhadrakas were mentioned as hailing from Kamboja Kingdom. In MBH verse 7.23.43, as it can be seen from original Sanskrit text, the term Prabhadraka has been used as a qualifier before the Kambojas: : (MBH Gorakhpore Rec., 7.23.42-44) Hence in this context, the term Prabhadraka definitely implies adjective and not noun, and may not, therefore, be confused with the Prabhadraka clan. As an adjective, the term Prabhadraka/Prabhadrakastu means \\"exceedingly handsome, exceedingly fortunate\\"Robert Shager, Ethnography of Ancient India (1954), p 140, Publisher: O. Harrassowitz, Ethnology; Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country (1981), p 69; Dr J. L. Kamboj; The Kambojas Through the Ages (2005), p 44, S Kirpal Singh. Also check up \\"Prabhadraka\\" in Monier-William Dictionary . Researchers like Dr Robert Shafer, Dr J. L. Kamboj, S Kirpal Singh etc. have, therefore correctly taken the term Prabhadraka in the sense of an adjective rather than noun in the present context and qualify Kambojas as \\"very handsome, very fortunate\\". Ganguli's translation is in error here. In fact, according to Sanskrit scholars, Ganguli's translation of Mahabharata has numerous translations errors. (See also note 4 & 5 in: Parama Kamboja Kingdom). They could be the army bought by Panchals from the Kambojas, since Kambojas were famous for lending their horses or cavalry to any party on payment basis:- The Prabhadrakas of the Kamvoja country, numbering 6000, with upraised weapons, with excellent steeds on their gold-decked cars, with stretched bows, supported Dhristadyumna (6, 19), (7,23). To distinguish them from the proper Panchala army or from other Prabhadrakas, they were mentioned as Prabhadraka-Panchalas (7,151). They were 6000 in numbers and mentioned as supporting Shikhandi at (7,151). They were an elite group in the Pandava army (5- 48, 199). This army is mentioned as allies of the Pandavas at (6,112), (7- 159, 182), (8- 12, 22, 30, 48, 49, 56, 67), (9- 7, 11, 15, 27). Karna slew 770 foremost of warriors among the Prabhadrakas initially (8,48). He then slew 1700 of them (8, 67). A group of Prabhadrakas is mentioned as battling against Dhristadyumna at (7,92):- The chief of the Avanti Kingdom (Mahabharata), with the Sauviras and the cruel Prabhadrakas, resisted wrathful Dhrishtadyumna. The Kasayas (Kasis), the Chedis, the Matsyas, the Srinjayas, the Panchalas, and the Prabhadrakas were mentioned as separate armies.Mahabharata, Bk. 5, Ch. 57. Prabhadrakas and Panchalas were mentioned as separate armies.Mahabharata, Bk. 5, Ch. 152 and 172; Bk. 6, Ch. 19, 49 and 56; Ch. 152; Bk. 7, Ch. 23, 33, 181 and 191; Ch. 152; Bk. 8, Ch. 61; and Ch. 152; Bk. 9, Ch. 1. When Ashwathama attacked the Panchalas in a night-time ambush, Shikhandi woke up, alarmed the Prabhadrakas and they tried to put up some resistance but all were slain. = Other references = *Brahmadatta is mentioned as a highly devout king of PanchalaMahabharata, Bk. 13, Ch. 137.

Some migrated to the newly independent Dutch provinces which welcomed the Sephardic Jews. Many of the Jews who left for the Dutch provinces were crypto-Jews, persons who had converted to Catholicism but continued to practice Judaism in secret. After they had settled in the safety of the Netherlands, many of them 'returned' fully to practice of the Jewish religion.  State of community prior to large scale migration  Many Jewish refugees came from Portugal, where Spanish Jews had fled after the Spanish Inquisition had been introduced in Spain in 1478, followed by the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. In 1497, the Portuguese forcibly converted all Jews in Portugal, including many who had returned to Judaism after fleeing Spain and its Inquisition. Following the establishment in 1536 of the Portuguese Inquisition, descendants of Jews who had converted to Catholicism dating back to a forced conversion in Spain in 1391 through the Portuguese forced conversion, were looked upon with great suspicion. In search of greater religious and economic freedoms, many crypto-Jews left Portugal for places with more lenient religious legislation and opportunities where their unique skill-sets could thrive. Many left for Brazil (where Europeans were Portuguese speaking) and France. A couple of decades later, groups of crypto-Jews started reaching the Dutch Republic.  Migration to Amsterdam  Amsterdam became one of the most favored destinations in the Netherlands for Sephardic Jews. Because many of the refugees were traders, Amsterdam benefited greatly from their arrival. However, the reason to settle in Amsterdam was not merely voluntary; many crypto-Jews, or Marranos, had been refused admission in trading centers like Middelburg and Haarlem, and because of that ended up in Amsterdam. Under the influence of Sephardic Jews, Amsterdam grew rapidly. Many Jews supported the House of Orange, and were in return protected by the stadholder.  Relationship with Amsterdam officials  Many types of discriminatory laws commonplace elsewhere and previously in medieval times were not in place in Amsterdam; to the extent such laws were on the books, they weren't always followed strictly. In part, such general religious toleration arose before Jews came to Amsterdam, as city officials adopted a policy of freedom of conscience in joining the Union of Utrecht. Despite voiced challenges toward the loose legislation tolerating Jews, Burgomasters continued to enact laws tailored to their own pragmatic vision of society, even if they were contrary to popular opinion disfavoring Jews. Much of the toleration expressed by the Amsterdam officials was rooted in the economic assets the new Portuguese Jewish community could provide, as well as the officials‚Äô lack of prior experience with Jewish residents. These factors made Amsterdam officials and even residents less susceptible to labeling the entire Jewish community by their negatively perceived history in Christian tradition. While the Jews of Amsterdam enjoyed greater freedoms in the religious and economic spheres of everyday life, which helped them assimilate more quickly and efficiently into Amsterdam society, they were denied certain political privileges, like participation in municipal government.  Religious identity and community in Amsterdam  The Jewish community of Amsterdam was self- governing, with the Imposta board overseeing communal and individual conduct until the establishment of the unified Mahamad committee in 1639, seven prominent individuals who had final say over all that happened among the Jewish community. The Mahamad was self-sustaining, with members appointing their own successors, thus keeping the communal power in the hands of the merchant elite among the Portuguese Jews. Besides providing for and overseeing the institutions of Sephardic Jewry in Amsterdam, the Mahamad also closely controlled the process of re-judaization - that is helping those whose families had been secretly living as Jews while being outwardly Catholic return to a full Jewish life. In this process, several individuals rejected Rabbinic Judaism or advanced ideas outside of the norms of Judaism at that time and were disciplined by the Mahamad through the process of herem, which could be anything from denial of Torah honors to an outright ban on the individual. The most famous of those to receive a full ban herem was philosopher Baruch Spinoza, whose intellectual contributions were very important in his time and continue to influence thinkers to this day.  Commerce  = International commerce = The migration of Jews from Portugal and Spain to many places other than Amsterdam allowed them to build a strong international trading network that was unique to diaspora members. Because of the business and family relations many Amsterdam Jews had in light of their former community‚Äôs dispersal, they established trading connections with the Levant and Morocco. For instance, the Jewish-Moroccan merchant Samuel Pallache (ca. 1550-1616) was sent to the Dutch Republic by Sultan Zidan Abu Maali of Morocco in 1608 to be his ambassador at The Hague. In particular, the relations between the Dutch and South America were established by Sephardic Jews; they contributed to the establishment of the Dutch West Indies Company in 1621, and some of them were members of its directorate. The ambitious schemes of the Dutch for the conquest of Brazil were carried into effect through Francisco Ribeiro, a Portuguese captain, who is said to have had Jewish relations in Holland. After the Dutch in Brazil appealed to Holland for craftsmen of all kinds, many Jews went to Brazil; about 600 Jews left Amsterdam in 1642, accompanied by two distinguished scholars ‚Äî Isaac Aboab da Fonseca and Moses Raphael de Aguilar. In the struggle between Holland and Portugal for the possession of Brazil, the Dutch were supported by the Jews. The Jews of Amsterdam also established commercial relations with various countries in Europe. In a letter dated November 25, 1622, King Christian IV of Denmark invited Jews from Amsterdam to settle in Gl√ºckstadt, where, among other privileges, the free exercise of their religion would be assured to them. = Commerce and occupations in Amsterdam = Besides merchants, a great number of physicians were among the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in Amsterdam, including Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family. Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange (April, 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science which was of practical use to them, for they were not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews taken into the trade guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in 1632 excluded them. Exceptions, however, were made in the case of trades which stood in peculiar relations to their religion: printing, bookselling, the selling of meat, poultry, groceries, and drugs. Jews tended to involve themselves in newer industries in Amsterdam, like the importation of colonial products, that just so happened to not have as many guild restrictions attached to them. In 1655, a Jew was permitted to establish a sugar refinery. Jews also became heavily involved in the jewelry and tobacco industries. While occupational status did not differ greatly between Jews and the rest of the Amsterdam population, Jews were far more concentrated in particular lines of commerce.  Decline  The migration of Sephardic Jews from the Netherlands to the Caribbean Antilles began in the mid-17th century, after the Dutch fleet captured the island of Cura√ßao from the Spaniards in 1634. One generation later, several waves of migrant Jewish and Protestant families from the Netherlands had established a shipping and trading settlement in Willemstad, a natural harbour controlled by the Dutch West Indies Company. The Dutch troops lost the Brazilian colony of Recife to the Portuguese in 1654, which forced many Dutch Sephardic refugees from Brazil to move to Cura√ßao or to the colony of New Amsterdam (Manhattan). By the 1680s, the Portuguese Sephardic Community of Amsterdam was on the decline. With the Netherlands experiencing economic difficulty (in part due to loss of New World colonies) some Jews left and immigration slowed. The Ashkenazic community became the larger Jewish community in Amsterdam, even as the Sephardic Jews kept positions of power and remained the significantly wealthier community. The process of emancipation, granting Jews full Dutch citizenship in the late 18th and early 19th century, continued the erosion of power the Mahamad held over the community. Holocaust On the eve of the Holocaust, there were approximately 4,300 Sephardic Jews living in the Netherlands, of a total Jewish population of some 140,000 (3%). After the war, the Sephardic community had declined to some 800 people, 20% of the pre-war population. The Holocaust meant the end of the Sephardic community in The Hague; it ended after the war because most of the community members had perished in the Nazi concentration camps. Today Esnoga (Sephardic synagogue) in Amsterdam. Nowadays, the Sephardic community in the Netherlands, called the Portugees-Isra√´litisch Kerkgenootschap (PIK) (Portuguese-Israelite Religious Community), has a membership of some 270 families (translating to approximately 600 persons), and is concentrated in Amsterdam. They constitute now some 2% of the Dutch- Jewish community. The PIK also has a youth movement, J-PIG (Jongeren Portugees-Isra√´litische Gemeente - Youngsters Portuguese-Israelite Community). Amsterdam is still home to works of its once vibrant Sephardic community. The Portuguese Synagogue or Esnoga, which was inaugurated in 1675, is located at the heart of Amsterdam's Jewish Cultural Quarter and it is still in use today. The venerable Library Ets Haim - Livraria Montezinos was founded in 1616 and it is the oldest functioning Jewish library in the world. Also, the Sephardic cemetery Beth Haim in Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, a village on the outskirts of Amsterdam, has been in use since 1614 and is the oldest Jewish cemetery in the Netherlands. Another reminder of the Sephardic community in Amsterdam is the Huis De Pinto, a residence for the wealthy Sephardic family de Pinto, constructed in 1680.

Deen's primary culinary focus was Southern cuisine and familiar comfort food that is popular with Americans. In the show, classic dishes such as pot roast, fried okra, fried chicken and pecan pie were the norm, and overcomplicated or eccentric recipes were usually eschewed. Dishes that are flavorful and familiar were spotlighted, although the fat content and calorie count of the meals were often very high. Paula also showed off vignettes of Savannah, Georgia, where she co-owns with her sons Jamie and Bobby, The Lady & Sons. Deen's popularity, spurred by the show, led to a small role in the feature film Elizabethtown. Despite its seemingly Southern atmosphere, Paula's Home Cooking was taped in upstate New York until 2006; since then, shows had been taped at Deen's new home near Savannah. In 2008, Deen began work on a revamped version of the series called Paula's Best Dishes, in which friends and family join her in the kitchen to prepare recipes. Deen's sons often appeared as guests on the show. They too proved to be popular among Food Network's audience and now have their own show, Road Tasted, similar to Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. Deen's husband, Michael Groover, also appeared sporadically as a guest, and Food Network taped the Deen-Groover wedding in 2004 as a special edition of the show. The success of Paula's Home Cooking led to a line of cookbooks, a magazine, other television shows and specials, and related merchandise. Reruns of the show now air on Food Network's sister channel GAC. On June 21, 2013, the Food Network announced that they would not renew Deen's contract due to controversy surrounding Deen's use of a racial slur and racist jokes in her restaurant, effectively cancelling the series.

It details the history of the three major monotheistic traditions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, along with Buddhism and Hinduism. The evolution of the idea of God is traced from its ancient roots in the Middle East up to the present day. Summary =Judaism= Armstrong begins with the rise of the cult of Yahweh (Jahweh), one of the deities of Canaan. According to Armstrong, the cult of Yahweh consisted of a variety of ethnic groups that migrated to Canaan in three waves. These groups were united by their loyalty to Yahweh. Yahweh was unique in the ancient Middle East in that he actually participated in the profane lives of his worshipers. She then examines the sources of the Pentateuch by way of the four authors or groups of authors, known in the outmoded documentary hypothesis as J, E, P and D. Moreover, she explores some of the textual tensions that exist in the Pentateuch as a result of the theological tensions between these authors, or groups of authors. For Armstrong, this tension can be seen in, for example, the contrasting accounts of theophanies. The Jahwist (J) writes of very \\"intimate\\" encounters between Abraham and Yahweh, while the Elohist (E) \\"prefers to distance the event and make the old legends less anthropomorphic.\\" There follows an examination of the major Israelite prophets, including Isaiah, second Isaiah, Hosea and Ezekiel, and the contribution each made to the Jewish conception of God. =Christianity= Armstrong then turns to the stories attributed to the life of Jesus. She identifies his roots in the Pharisaic tradition of Hillel the Elder and his effect on the Jewish conception of a god. The death of Jesus and its attendant symbolism are examined, including the various constructions others, most notably Paul, have placed upon these events. The book explores the rise of trinitarianism, leading to the Nicene Creed, and traces the evolution of the Christian conception of God and the Trinity in the respective Eastern and Western traditions.Logic and Reason Armstrong discusses the rise of modern Christian religiosity, in particular the Protestantism of Martin Luther and John Calvin. =Islam= The rise of Islam and its appreciation of the nature of God are examined. Armstrong analyzes how modern Shia Islam, with its emphasis upon social action in the service of Allah, the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the Shia Imams, was a key factor that brought about the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Subsequent chapters examine respectively both philosophical approaches to the idea of God, and the mystical relationship with God. =Conclusion= The final chapters examine the notion of the Death of God and the idea of God in a post-modern world.

Publication history The Grace Balin version of Orca first appeared in Batman #579 (July 2000) and was created by Larry Hama and Scott McDaniel. The Dean Toye version of Orca first appeared in Aquaman Vol. 8 #12. Fictional character biography =Grace Balin= Grace Balin attends Gotham Gate College and quickly becomes fascinated with the ocean. She receives a Ph.D in marine biology and Bio-Medicine and takes a job at the Gotham Aquarium. She is a very charitable person who funds an after-school program involving the ocean for underprivileged youths. She also volunteers at a soup shelter and takes care of many homeless people. Dr. Balin is later involved in an accident that leaves her paralyzed, dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. She continues to work at the Gotham Aquarium until it is supposed to be closed for lack of funding. Grace experiments with spinal cord tissue regeneration using orca spinal cord tissue. The gene therapy studies and human experimentation that she was conducting is deemed controversial and results in her loss of funding. It is implied that Grace used a chemical formula that she derived from an orca in the aquarium on herself and that this is what caused her to transform into Orca. She is able to easily switch between being Orca and her regular appearance as Dr. Balin, although she is apparently still paralyzed as Balin even if Orca is fully mobile. Orca begins a crime spree in Gotham City by stealing a valuable diamond called the Flame of Persia from rogue millionaire Camille Baden-Smythe. After the theft, Batman becomes involved. Orca's dedication to what she perceives as justice conflicts with Batman's attempts to see that everyone is entitled to legal protection even if he dislikes them personally. Orca aims to sell the diamond and use the proceeds to help fund several projects for underprivileged people. After her attempt to sell the diamond back to Camille Baden-Smythe fails with the discovery that she had stolen the diamond originally, Orca attempts to kill her. Camille's security force shoots Orca several times, mortally wounding her. After an extensive underwater chase ‚Äî Batman using an aquatic-equipped suit ‚Äî she begins changing back into Dr. Balin in an underwater cavern, telling Batman that the only way that she can survive is if he gives her the rest of the chemical formula that turned her into Orca, and that this would permanently transform her into Orca. Although Camille tried to forbid Batman from giving her the formula, arguing that such an action would make Batman responsible for everyone she would subsequently kill, Batman states that they are all responsible for their own actions, as well as that he refuses to allow anyone to die. Having ingested the formula, Orca swims away, resolved to continue her current career. It is revealed that the jewel was then sold to its original owner and that the money was used to build a new recreation center near the aquarium as well as to \\"...gentrify a derelict waterfront tenement\\".Batman #579. DC Comics. Orca is not seen again until she appears as a prisoner in the Slab during the Joker‚Äôs \\"Last Laugh\\" riots. She is able to escape during the riots with King Shark.Joker: Last Laugh #2. DC Comics. One Year Later, Orca is found dead in the sewers under Gotham City. She appears to have been shot in the head by Harvey Dent's gun, although Batman is convinced Dent is not the true killer. He finds that her body has been partially eaten by Killer Croc. Orca's husband Terry was murdered by the Tally Man while he was being questioned about the disappearance of his wife by a private investigator Jason Bard. During the investigation it is revealed that Orca was working for the Penguin along with now deceased supervillains the KGBeast, the Magpie, and the Ventriloquist. Someone had contracted Orca and other supervillains to turn on the Penguin and rob one of his storage facilities. Harvey Dent catches them and instructs them to stay loyal to Penguin and to get any information they could about him. Dent is the prime suspect in their murders, but it turns out that they were orchestrated by the Great White Shark, who plans on becoming the top crime boss in Gotham. He manages to accomplish two tasks at once, weakening the Penguin's forces and transforming Harvey Dent back into Two-Face.Detective Comics #819. DC Comics.

Grace was formerly a member of the Run-Offs, a rehab group for former Gotham supervillains, but left because she considered herself too much of a monster to relate to them (implying that her transformation is permanent). After Nightwing and the Run-Offs defeat her, she reveals that they were just a distraction for Carter Forsyth to be killed by the False Face Society.Nightwing Vol. 4 #12. DC Comics. During Raptor's invasion of Bludhaven, Roland Desmond demonstrates his power to the Whale's Enders by easily taking down Orca with his bare hands. The Whale's Enders try to replicate Grace's formula to transform themselves into whale hybrids to level the playing field, but fail miserably and dissolve after they are defeated by Nightwing. When Raptor starts wreaking havoc in the city by using Roland's Blockbuster formula on the citizens, the Run-Offs seek Grace's knowledge in developing an antidote to cure the affected people. Orca's biochemistry knowledge helps save the city and she rejoins the Run-Offs at the end of the story arc.Nightwing Vol. 4 #32.

As the second-in-command to Major Rhonda Ricoh who has the codename of \\"Great White,\\" Orca and the Aquamarines are dispatched by the government to kill Aquaman at the time when he was framed by the organization N.E.M.O. Orca and the Aquamarines are defeated by Aquaman and are detained by the Atlanteans as prisoners of war.Aquaman Vol 8 #14. DC Comics. Powers and abilities The Grace Balin version of Orca has enhanced strength and endurance, although her strength has not been enhanced to the point where a trained fighter like Batman would have significant trouble with her on land. Her main advantage lies in her exceptional swimming abilities, allowing her to be at complete ease in water, able to swim under water for long periods without taking a breath, forcing Batman to use an aquatic costume to effectively confront her on equal terms. The Dean Toye version of Orca also has similar abilities.

Thompson chose 77 acres of land near Spanish Creek‚Äîself- reportedly because his \\"Irish Druid Radar\\" had gone off while driving past‚Äîwhere Lindisfarne began to construct new buildings for its purposes.Collins (1982), pp. 24‚Äì25, 43‚Äì44. Today the Lindisfarne Fellows House, the Lindisfarne Chapel, and the Lindisfarne Mountain Retreat are under the ownership and management of the Crestone Mountain Zen Center. Lindisfarne has functioned variously as a sponsor of classes, conferences, and concerts and public lectures events, and as a think tank and retreat, similar to the Esalen Institute in California. Lindisfarne functioned as a not-for-profit foundation until 2009; the Lindisfarne Fellowship continued to hold annual meetings until 2012. It is no longer an active organization. In addition to its facility in Crestone (the \\"Lindisfarne Mountain Retreat\\"), three other branches of the organization were formed:Redenius (1985), p. 254. * a headquarters in New York City at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine; * the Lindisfarne Press was established in Stockbridge, Massachusetts; and * the Lindisfarne Fellows House was opened at the San Francisco Zen Center. Goals and doctrine The Lindisfarne doctrine is closely related to that of its founder, William Thompson. Mentioned as part of the Lindisfarne ideology are a long list of spiritual and esoteric traditions including yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese traditional medicine, Hermeticism, Celtic animism, Gnosticism, cabala, geomancy, ley lines, Pythagoreanism, and ancient mystery religions.Collins (1982), pp. 14‚Äì18. 34‚Äì35. The group placed a special emphasis on sacred geometry, defined by Thompson as \\"a vision of divine intelligence, the logos, revealing itself in all forms, from the logarithmic spiral of a seashell to the hexagonal patterns of cooling basalt, from the architecture of the molecule to the galaxy.\\"William Irwin Thompson, Darkness and Scattered Light (1978), p. 138; quoted in Collins (1982), pp. 21‚Äì22. Rachel Fletcher, Robert Lawlor, and Keith Critchlow lectured at Crestone on the application of sacred geometry, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism to architecture.Collins (1982), p. 52‚Äì53. The exemplar of these ideas is the Grail Chapel in Crestone (also known as Lindisfarne Chapel), which is built to reflect numerous basic geometrical relationships.Collins (1982), pp. 55‚Äì106. Lindisfarne's social agenda was exemplified by the \\"meta-industrial village\\", a small community focused on subsistence and crafts while yet connected to a world culture. All members of a community might participate in essential tasks such as the harvest. (Thompson has speculated that in the United States, 40% of the population could work at agriculture, and another 40% in social services.) The villages would have a sense of shared purpose in transforming world culture. They would combine \\"the four classical economies of human history, hunting and gathering, agriculture, industry, and cybernetics\\", all \\"recapitulated within a single deme.\\"Collins (1982), pp. 127‚Äì131. (The \\"Meadowcreek Project\\" in Arkansas, begun in 1979 by David and Wilson Orr, was an effort to actualize a meta-industrial village as envisioned by the Lindisfarne Association. This project received funding from the Ozarks Regional Commission, the Arkansas Energy Department, and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation.)Collins (1982), pp. 134‚Äì136.\\"The Meadowcreek Project: A Model of Sustainability in the Ozarks\\", Mother Earth News, March/April 1982. The villages would be linked together by an electronic information network (i.e., what today we call the internet). Thompson called for a counter- cultural vanguard \\"which can formulate an integral vision of culture and maintain the high standards of that culture without compromise to the forces of electronic vulgarization.\\" William Irwin Thompson, Darkness and Scattered Light (1978), pp. 71‚Äì72; quoted in Collins (1982), p. 113; and Collins pp. 118‚Äì122. According to the Lindisfarne Association website, Lindisfarne's fourfold goals are: # The Planetization of the Esoteric # The realization of the inner harmony of all the great universal religions and the spiritual traditions of the tribal peoples of the world. # The fostering of a new and healthier balance between nature and culture through the research and development of appropriate technologies, architectural settlements and compassionate economies for meta-industrial villages and convivial cities. # The illumination of the spiritual foundations of political governance through scholarship and artistic communications that foster a global ecology of consciousness beyond the present ideological systems of warring industrial nation-states, outraged traditional societies, and ravaged lands and seas. Thompson has also stated the United States has a unique role to play in the promotion of planetary culture because people from all over the world mingle there.Redenius (1985), p. 256. Lindisfarne sought to spread its message widely, through a mailing list and through book publications of the Lindisfarne press.Redenius (1985), p. 255. Journalist Sally Helgesen, after a visit in 1977, criticized Lindisfarne as confused pseudo-intellectuals, citing for example their attempt to build an expensive fish \\"bioshelter\\" while overlooking a marsh with fish in it.Helgesen (1977), p. 82.

The tenth tropical storm of the season, Zeb formed on October 10 from the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands. It moved westward initially and quickly intensified. Zeb's inflow briefly spawned another tropical storm, which it ultimately absorbed. Developing an eye, Zeb rapidly intensified into a super typhoon, officially reaching maximum sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph); one warning agency estimated winds as high as 285 km/h (180 mph). After reaching peak intensity, the typhoon struck northern Luzon and quickly weakened over land. Turning to the north, Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan at a reduced intensity, and after accelerating to the northeast it moved through Japan. It became extratropical on October 18 and moved eastward over open waters. First affecting the Philippines, Zeb dropped torrential rainfall in Luzon, reaching in one day in La Trinidad, estimated as a one-in-1,147-year event. The rains caused floods and landslides, which compounded with high winds to leave heavy crop damage. Zeb destroyed or damaged 85,844 houses in the Philippines, and damage in the country was estimated at ‚Ç±5.375 billion (1998 Philippine pesos, $126 million U.S. dollars), the fifth-costliest at the time. There were also 83 deaths in the country, a number compounded upon when Typhoon Babs struck the same region a week later. High winds and rainfall from Zeb later affected Taiwan, causing NT$4.15 billion (New Taiwan dollar, $125 million USD) in damage as well as 31 deaths. Gusty winds affected much of Japan, while heavy rainfall peaked at on Mount Ontake. The storm killed 14 people in the country, several related to landslides. Zeb destroyed 770 homes and flooded another 12,548 in Japan. Meteorological history The monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance over the western Pacific Ocean to the east of Guam around October 7. The system moved steadily westward, organizing enough for the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on October 9. After the disturbance passed south of Guam, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 18W late on October 9, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit the next day. While passing north of Yap in the Caroline Islands, the depression intensified into a tropical storm according to the JTWC, which gave it the name Zeb. The JMA again was delayed in upgrading by a day. After becoming a tropical storm, Zeb proceeded to steadily intensify. Its large inflow spawned a circulation well to the east-northeast, which organized into a separate tropical storm - Alex. Early on October 11, the storm entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA - the Philippine-based weather agency - which gave it the local name Iliang. Late on October 11, the JTWC upgraded Zeb to typhoon status, or one-minute winds of at least . This was based on the appearance of a banding-type eye on satellite imagery. On October 12, the storm rapidly intensified as it turned more to the west-northwest toward the Philippines. During this time, it caused increased wind shear over the smaller Tropical Storm Alex to the east-northeast, ultimately absorbing it. At 00:00 UTC on October 13, the JTWC upgraded Zeb to super typhoon status, estimating winds of , marking that Zeb attained Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Twelve hours later, the agency estimated that the typhoon strengthened further to a peak of 285 km/h (180 mph), making it the strongest storm of the season. At the same time, PAGASA also estimated peak 10-minute winds of , also designating Zeb as a super typhoon. Late on October 13, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of just east of the island of Luzon. While near peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that winds of extended , and gales extended from the center. Zeb's eyewall continued to contract up until it moved ashore. Early on October 14, Zeb made landfall on eastern Luzon just south of Palanan Bay, or east of Ilagan, near peak intensity. The typhoon weakened rapidly over land, while its track shifted more to the north around a ridge to the east. It emerged into the Luzon Strait between the eponymous island and Taiwan with a much larger eyewall, and failed to re-intensify over open waters. Late on October 15, Zeb passed within of Taiwan's east coast before accelerating to the northeast due to a passing trough. The JMA downgraded the typhoon to tropical storm status on October 16, although the JTWC retained Zeb at typhoon status. Favorable upper-level conditions allowed the storm to briefly re- intensify after passing Taiwan, although this was short-lived, and it weakened while accelerating toward Japan. At 07:00 UTC on October 17, Zeb struck southern Kyushu in Kagoshima Prefecture. It continued northeastward through the country, striking K≈çchi Prefecture on Shikoku and later crossing central Honshu as a tropical storm. During this time, the storm was losing tropical characteristics as it swiftly entered the Sea of Japan. At 00:00 UTC on September 18, the JMA declared Zeb extratropical, and shortly after the storm moved over northern Hokkaido and into the Sea of Okhotsk. The remnants moved across the southern Kamchatka Peninsula and continued eastward through the open north Pacific. It was last noted by the JMA early on October 20. Preparations Ahead of the storm, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signal #4, in which winds of over were expected within 12 hours. The warning covered Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Quirino, and northern Aurora. Lesser warnings were issued as far south as the Visayas, and extended into the Metro Manila area. After two damaging storms in September, the government began making widespread preparations on October 13, organizing efforts through its National Disaster Coordinating Council. Ports were closed and flights were canceled due to the storm. Before the worst of the storm struck, power companies shut off electricity to prevent accidents. About 103,000 people evacuated their homes, including over 6,325 staying in 114 government shelters. Evacuations extended as far south as Camarines Sur. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a stand-by warning signal #1 due to the storm's proximity to the South China Sea. Before Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan, a typhoon warning was issued, causing schools, government buildings, and financial markets to close. Airports and ferry travel were also disrupted. 183 residents evacuated to storm shelters, including 50 from a nursing home. Hundreds of Chinese fishing boats rode out the storm in Taiwan harbors. Similarly to Taiwan, Zeb delayed ferry service in Japan, and caused 271 domestic flights to be canceled. Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm. Impact Another satellite image of Zeb making landfall on Luzon =Philippines= Striking the Philippines at peak intensity, Zeb largely affected the island of Luzon, including the regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, and Central Luzon. Wind gusts were estimated as high as in the country. The storm also dropped torrential rainfall, particularly in mountainous regions. In the municipality of Bakun, the rain gauge overflowed, and in nearby La Trinidad, the rainfall was on October 14 alone. The latter total was estimated as a one-in-1,147-year event, based on the history of local rainfall totals. In the city of Baguio, the precipitation reached , enough to flood the town deep. The Binga and Ambuclao dams in Benguet were unable to support the rains from the storm, forcing them to be opened and flood three towns in neighboring Pangasinan. Minor street flooding occurred along the west coast near Manila. Across Luzon, the high rains caused flooding, landslides, and halted construction of a dam in Bakun. Considered one of the strongest typhoons to hit the area in decades, Zeb knocked down trees and power lines, which covered roads and left areas isolated. The winds were strong enough to blow over a jeepney. Along its path, the storm destroyed 26,305 houses and damaged another 59,539, mostly affecting those of weaker building materials. River flooding caused heavy damage to crops, estimated at ‚Ç±1.76 billion (1998 Philippine pesos, $41.3 million U.S. dollars); the storm destroyed of rice in Ilocos Region and Cagayan Valley. Most of the damage occurred in Luzon, with little impact elsewhere. The storm also marred the local infrastructure; areas in northeastern Luzon were isolated when landslides blocked a highway, and several other roads and bridges were impassible. Overall, Zeb killed 83 people in the country, while injuring another 63; most of the deaths were related to the landslides, and 33 of the deaths were in Cordillera Administrative Region. Overall damage was estimated at ‚Ç±5.375 billion (PHP, $126 million USD), which as of 2011 was the thirteenth-costliest typhoon in the Philippines and the fifth-costliest at the time. =Elsewhere= The interaction between Zeb and the monsoon brought gusty winds to Hong Kong, reaching on Cheung Chau. High tides were also recorded, although there was no reported damage in the territory. Later, Zeb produced sustained winds of in Taiwan, although gusts topped at . The typhoon dropped torrential rainfall in the northern and eastern portions of the island, with peak hourly rates of . Several regions of Taiwan received over of rainfall. The rains caused severe flooding along rivers, with a peak discharge of 3715 m¬≥/s (131,193 ft¬≥/s). The high rainfall forced workers at the Fei-tsui Dam to release water, after water levels rose by . Landslides near Taipei wrecked homes, trapping at least two people. Landslides also covered several highways while floods washed away bridges, cutting off traffic. Flooding occurred in the suburbs of Taipei, and the winds were strong enough to cause skyscrapers to sway in the city. Zeb's winds knocked over trees, billboards, and power lines, leaving 1.15 million without electricity. Two-story high waves killed a fisherman in Taitung City, washed a freighter ashore in Taichung, and capsized a boat in Tamsui District, killing one sailor; five of the others on board swam two hours to reach shore. The storm left $57.6 million (USD) in crop damage, after hundreds of acres of fields were damaged in the southern and central Taiwan. Overall damage was estimated at NT$4.15 billion (New Taiwan dollar, $125 million USD), and there were 31 confirmed deaths in Taiwan, with 19 people injured. Typhoon Zeb making landfall on Kyushu on October 17 While moving through Japan, Zeb produced peak sustained winds of in K≈çchi Prefecture within Shikoku. The highest rainfall was on Mount Ontake on Honshu. The widespread rainfall caused 332 landslides and washed away seven bridges. Within Japan, Zeb first affected Miyako-jima while passing about to the northwest. High winds left 2,600 houses without power and caused damage to public buildings. It later passed about to the northwest of Okinawa. Along the island, wind gusts reached , and wave heights peaked at 13.7 m (45 ft). The waves swept away two people over a sea wall, killing them both. High waves also damaged a port at Kadena Air Base as well as several houses near the coast. The storm also passed near the Yaeyama Islands with strong winds. Salt spray coated trees and ruined them, and there was scattered public building damage. On Kyushu, Zeb damaged houses, marred crops, and flooded rivers. The storm spawned a tornado in Miyazaki Prefecture that damaged two roofs and a vehicle. In Saganoseki, a motorist died after a roadway collapse landed his vehicle in a nearby river. On Shikoku, Zeb destroyed roads and farmlands and eroded lands along waterways. Three people died due to a landslide in Matsuyama. In Okayama Prefecture along Honshu, Zeb left six people missing or killed and was the costliest typhoon since Typhoon Fran in 1976. Landslides killed three people in Hiroshima Prefecture. Power outages and landslides affected much of Honshu, while strong winds damaged many fields. A cargo freighter washed aground amid high waves in Shizuoka Prefecture, causing oil to leak and requiring assistance from the Coast Guard; oil recovery equipment was sent to the area to clean the spill. Lastly, Zeb affected the northern island of Hokkaido, causing one landslide, damaging 152 buildings, and knocking 152,000 apples to the ground. Nationwide, Zeb destroyed 770 homes and flooded another 12,548, with thousands forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. Overall, there were 14 deaths and 67 injuries, with damage estimated at $335.5 million (1998 USD). Aftermath After the storm, then-Philippine president Joseph Estrada declared six provinces as a state of calamity, which allocated ‚Ç±1 million in emergency funds for each province. The president was unable to return home from a trip to Singapore due to the storm. The military was activated to help organize relief efforts, using rubber boats and trucks to reach the hardest hit areas as floodwaters decreased. They were aided by the Philippine Red Cross and other government agencies. Most evacuees returned home after the storm passed, excluding those whose houses sustained damage. Volunteers, the military, and public workers helped clean up from the damage. Just seven days after Zeb's damaging Philippine landfall, another typhoon‚ÄîBabs‚Äîstruck the same general region with a similar, but lesser intensity. After both storms, the Philippine National Electrification Administration provided ‚Ç±1.78 million to the Batanes Electric Cooperative to restore damaged power lines. Power was gradually restored in northeastern Luzon, allowing communication of the damage extent. The nation's Department of Health distributed ‚Ç±547,469 worth of medicine to four provinces. The government airlifted about 3,000 bags of supplies to Cagayan that included rice and canned goods. The back to back storm impacts caused an estimated 30% drop in coconut exports. Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400%, after both storms damaged crops. The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived. By December 1998, consumer prices had risen by 11.2% over the previous year due to the typhoons' damage. Workers in Taiwan began a search-and-rescue mission for missing victims once the typhoon warning was lifted. Workers immediately began repairing road damage in Japan once the storm passed.

(Compared to the frequency of the family name Kr√ºger, the name Cr√ºger is relatively uncommon.) Cr√ºger studied at the universities in K√∂nigsberg, Leipzig and Wittenberg, graduating from Wittenberg in 1606. Among his teachers were Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. He then moved to the city of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) in the Kingdom of Poland, where he worked for the rest of his life as a professor of poetry and mathematics at the Danziger Akademikum (Danzig Academy). As a philosopher and poet, Cr√ºger was associated with the poet Johannes Plavius, who in his Institutio Poetica mentions Cr√ºger in the opening letter. Cr√ºger dedicated an extremely laudatory poem to Plavius, which appears in the preface to Plavius' Praecepta logicalia. At the time of the Thirty Years' War a number of Silesians took refuge in Danzig from the ravages of war in their towns, among them Andreas Gryphius, who, when he studied at the Danzig academy from 1634 to 1636, had Cr√ºger as a teacher; here: p. 74. and was very much influenced by the famous mathematician and astronomer.

More specifically, twisted K-theory with twist H is a particular variant of K-theory, in which the twist is given by an integral 3-dimensional cohomology class. It is special among the various twists that K-theory admits for two reasons. First, it admits a geometric formulation. This was provided in two steps; the first one was done in 1970 (Publ. Math. de l'IH√âS) by Peter Donovan and Max Karoubi; the second one in 1988 by Jonathan Rosenberg in Continuous- Trace Algebras from the Bundle Theoretic Point of View. In physics, it has been conjectured to classify D-branes, Ramond-Ramond field strengths and in some cases even spinors in type II string theory. For more information on twisted K-theory in string theory, see K-theory (physics). In the broader context of K-theory, in each subject it has numerous isomorphic formulations and, in many cases, isomorphisms relating definitions in various subjects have been proven. It also has numerous deformations, for example, in abstract algebra K-theory may be twisted by any integral cohomology class. The definition To motivate Rosenberg's geometric formulation of twisted K-theory, start from the Atiyah‚ÄìJ√§nich theorem, stating that :Fred(mathcal H), the Fredholm operators on Hilbert space mathcal H, is a classifying space for ordinary, untwisted K-theory. This means that the K-theory of the space M consists of the homotopy classes of maps :[Mrightarrow Fred(mathcal H)] from M to Fred(mathcal H). A slightly more complicated way of saying the same thing is as follows. Consider the trivial bundle of Fred(mathcal H) over M, that is, the Cartesian product of M and Fred(mathcal H). Then the K-theory of M consists of the homotopy classes of sections of this bundle. We can make this yet more complicated by introducing a trivial :PU(mathcal H) bundle P over M, where PU(mathcal H) is the group of projective unitary operators on the Hilbert space mathcal H. Then the group of maps :[Prightarrow Fred(mathcal H)]_{PU(mathcal H)} from P to Fred(mathcal H) which are equivariant under an action of PU(mathcal H) is equivalent to the original groups of maps :[Mrightarrow Fred(mathcal H)]. This more complicated construction of ordinary K-theory is naturally generalized to the twisted case. To see this, note that PU(mathcal H) bundles on M are classified by elements H of the third integral cohomology group of M. This is a consequence of the fact that PU(mathcal H) topologically is a representative Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space :K(mathbf Z,2). The generalization is then straightforward. Rosenberg has defined :K_H(M), the twisted K-theory of M with twist given by the 3-class H, to be the space of homotopy classes of sections of the trivial Fred(mathcal H) bundle over M that are covariant with respect to a PU(mathcal H) bundle P_H fibered over M with 3-class H, that is :K_H(M)=[P_Hrightarrow Fred(mathcal H)]_{PU(mathcal H)}. Equivalently, it is the space of homotopy classes of sections of the Fred(mathcal H) bundles associated to a PU(mathcal H) bundle with class H. What is it? When H is the trivial class, twisted K-theory is just untwisted K-theory, which is a ring. However, when H is nontrivial this theory is no longer a ring. It has an addition, but it is no longer closed under multiplication. However, the direct sum of the twisted K-theories of M with all possible twists is a ring. In particular, the product of an element of K-theory with twist H with an element of K-theory with twist H' is an element of K-theory twisted by H+H'. This element can be constructed directly from the above definition by using adjoints of Fredholm operators and construct a specific 2 x 2 matrix out of them (see the reference 1, where a more natural and general Z/2-graded version is also presented). In particular twisted K-theory is a module over classical K-theory. How to calculate it Physicist typically want to calculate twisted K-theory using the Atiyah‚ÄìHirzebruch spectral sequence.A guide to such calculations in the case of twisted K-theory can be found in E8 Gauge Theory, and a Derivation of K-Theory from M-Theory by Emanuel Diaconescu, Gregory Moore and Edward Witten (DMW). The idea is that one begins with all of the even or all of the odd integral cohomology, depending on whether one wishes to calculate the twisted K_0 or the twisted K^0, and then one takes the cohomology with respect to a series of differential operators. The first operator, d_3, for example, is the sum of the three-class H, which in string theory corresponds to the Neveu-Schwarz 3-form, and the third Steenrod square.(DMW) also provide a crash course in Steenrod squares for physicists. No elementary form for the next operator, d_5, has been found, although several conjectured forms exist. Higher operators do not contribute to the K-theory of a 10-manifold, which is the dimension of interest in critical superstring theory. Over the rationals Michael Atiyah and Graeme Segal have shown that all of the differentials reduce to Massey products of M.In Twisted K-theory and cohomology. After taking the cohomology with respect to the full series of differentials one obtains twisted K-theory as a set, but to obtain the full group structure one in general needs to solve an extension problem. =Example: the three-sphere= The three-sphere, S^3, has trivial cohomology except for H^0(S^3) and H^3(S^3) which are both isomorphic to the integers. Thus the even and odd cohomologies are both isomorphic to the integers. Because the three-sphere is of dimension three, which is less than five, the third Steenrod square is trivial on its cohomology and so the first nontrivial differential is just d_5 = H. The later differentials increase the degree of a cohomology class by more than three and so are again trivial; thus the twisted K-theory is just the cohomology of the operator d_3 which acts on a class by cupping it with the 3-class H. Imagine that H is the trivial class, zero. Then d_3 is also trivial. Thus its entire domain is its kernel, and nothing is in its image. Thus K^0_H(S^3) is the kernel of d_3 in the even cohomology, which is the full even cohomology, which consists of the integers. Similarly K^1_H(S^3) consists of the odd cohomology quotiented by the image of d_3, in other words quotiented by the trivial group. This leaves the original odd cohomology, which is again the integers. In conclusion, K^0 and K^1 of the three-sphere with trivial twist are both isomorphic to the integers. As expected, this agrees with the untwisted K-theory. Now consider the case in which H is nontrivial. H is defined to be an element of the third integral cohomology, which is isomorphic to the integers. Thus H corresponds to a number, which we will call n. d_3 now takes an element m of H^0 and yields the element nm of H^3. As n is not equal to zero by assumption, the only element of the kernel of d_3 is the zero element, and so K_{H=n}^0(S^3)=0. The image of d_3 consists of all elements of the integers that are multiples of n. Therefore, the odd cohomology, mathbb{Z}, quotiented by the image of d_3, nmathbb{Z}, is the cyclic group of order n, mathbb{Z}/n. In conclusion :K^1_{H=n}(S^3) = mathbb{Z}/n In string theory this result reproduces the classification of D-branes on the 3-sphere with n units of H-flux, which corresponds to the set of symmetric boundary conditions in the supersymmetric SU(2) WZW model at level n-2. There is an extension of this calculation to the group manifold of SU(3).In D-Brane Instantons and K-Theory Charges by Juan Maldacena, Gregory Moore and Nathan Seiberg.

The former Benazir Bhutto International Airport forms part of this airbase. Fazaia Intermediate College, Nur Khan is also located in the base. History USAF C-17 at Chaklala AirBase Rawalpindi The base was originally operated by the Royal Air Force as RAF Chaklala and, during the Second World War, parachute training flights were conducted. Once transferred to the then Royal Pakistan Air Force the base came into use as a transport hub, with the PAF's fleet of various transport aircraft operating from it. After the Pakistan earthquake of 2005, 300 U.S. troops as well as U.S. aircraft were deployed to Chaklala to aid in relief efforts. According to an anonymous 2013 source, the U.S. had maintained a permanent military presence at Chaklala since late 2001 for handling logistics efforts and other movements in relation to the war in Afghanistan. In 2009 the PAF's first of four Il-78 aerial refuelling tanker aircraft was delivered to PAF Base Chaklala and the No. 10 MRTT (Multi Role Tanker Transport) squadron was established there. The name of the base was changed in 2012 from PAF Base Chaklala to PAF Base Nur Khan in remembrance of its first Base Commander, Air Marshal Nur Khan. Nur Khan was also the second Pakistani chief of the Pakistan Air Force and a veteran of several conflicts fought by Pakistan. Squadrons The squadrons at the base are Nos 6, 10, 12, and 41. No. 6 Squadron was formed without any aircraft or equipment on 14 August 1947 at Maripur, Karachi, under its first commanding officer, Flight Lieutenant M. J. Khan. On 16 August 1947, Air Officer Commanding Air Vice Marshal visited the squadron and commissioned it for heavy airlifting and airborne operations. The PAF acquired a Douglas DC-3 Dakota aircraft on 22 October 1947 and later obtained Bristol Freighter, Tiger Moth, and Auster AOP.9 aircraft. On 29 June 1948, a detachment of the squadron provided a guard of honour at Mauripur for Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah on his arrival from Quetta. On 9 September 1948, three Dakota aircraft performed a flypast at the Quaid-e- Azam's funeral ceremony In the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War the Antelopes dropped parachute commandos into Indian territory in a night-time mission involving three C-130B transports. Just before the 1965 war started, the squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Eric Gordan Hall, had the idea of making up for the PAF's deficiency in heavy bombers by modifying the Hercules to carry bombs.[2] It was converted to carry 10,000 kg of bombs, which were rolled out on pallets from the rear ramp, and over 21 night-time bombing raids were flown against Indian forces approaching for the Battles of Chawinda and Pul Kanjari. Support missions for troops in the Northern Areas were continued after the war. With the unstable political situation at the end of 1970 and the resulting civil unrest, the Antelopes moved a large number of troops to East Pakistan and assisted in flood relief operations there. India stopped the PAF flying over its territory in 1971, and the squadron had to fly to East Pakistan via Sri Lanka. Two of the unit's C-130 transports were deployed to Dhaka from March 71 until the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War began on 3 December 1971. They were used to evacuate soldiers and civilians from hostile areas of East Pakistan ‚Äì in one sortie a single C-130 evacuated 365 people from Sylhet to Dhaka. During the 1971 war, No. 6 Squadron flew bombing missions from West Pakistan in the same manner as those flown during the 1961 war, and no transport aircraft were lost during these sorties No. 12 Composite Squadron in September 1953, the Squadron Consists of PAF's Elite Air Crafts amongst which includes Phenom 100 and Gulf Stream IV. No. 10 Squadron was established as the Tanker Transport (MRTT) Squadron (\\"Bulls\\") with delivery of the PAF's first Il-78 in December 2009 and operating from PAF Base Chaklala. 41 Squadron PAF, which consists of Cessna, Beech, and Y-12 amongst other aircraft. Achievements The base has had many achievements since 1947. Amongst these some worth mentioning are the outstanding performances at the Royal International Air Tattoo. In 2006 the C130 Hercules of No 6 Squadron under the command of then Wing Commander and now Air Commodore Haseeb Gul won the Concours d‚ÄôElegance competition, also lifting the Page Aerospace Trophy as well as the BAE Systems‚Äô Trophy for winning the Spirit of the Meet competition. A decade later the No 6 Squadron C130 Hercules under the command of Wing Commander Teymoor Hussain participated in Royal International Air Tattoo 2016 where it won the Concours d‚ÄôElegance competition. Location The base has surrounding facilities including the Frontier Works Organization Headquarters, Chaklala Railway Station and the Joint Services Headquarters (JSHQ). Two housing schemes Askaris VIII and IX are also located alongside Nur Khan road that extends to the main entrance of the base from Airport Road. The Centre for Aerospace and Security Studies, a research think tank founded by the Pakistan Air Force, is located next to Nur Khan Base.

Flight  Flight 700Z originated from Singapore International Airport (Now Paya Lebar Air Base) and had a stopover at Bangkok's Don Mueang International Airport, with the final destination being Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport. At 0542 hours GMT (1242 local time), the flight made contact with Saigon ACC. At 0544, the crew made a routine transmission updating the progress of their route, adding that they would expect to reach their next waypoint by 0606 GMT. This was the last transmission received from the flight.Cathay Pacific Airways, Convair 880-22M, VR-HFZ, accident, near Pleiku, South Vietnam, on 15 June 1972 - ICAO Circular 118-AN/88  Investigation  The wreckage was located in \\"lightly wooded\\" terrain, still burning, not long after Saigon ACC lost contact. Although two bodies were retrieved almost immediately, the presence of hostile forces nearby made it very difficult to examine the wreckage in depth. The spread of debris suggested that the airplane had broken into three large sections, with the breakpoints almost exactly along the front and rear of the wingbox, prior to hitting the ground, and the relative closeness of these sections suggested that this breakup had occurred at a low altitude. Other debris, including two engines and the horizontal stabilizer, could be seen further away from helicopters, but could not be reached on foot due to war activity. The aircraft's flight data recorder was recovered and read; it showed that the airplane was flying on course at 29,000 feet at a speed of 310 knots until 0559 GMT (1259 local time), at which point the recorded data became nonsensical for 30 seconds before stopping entirely. The airplane was not equipped with a cockpit voice recorder. Upon examining the available debris, it soon become clear that the airplane had suffered some sort of structural problem and loss of control at cruising altitude, and that the low- altitude breakup was caused by the overstressing of the airplane during an uncontrolled descent. Debris from the center fuselage and right wing root showed signs of explosive \\"splash,\\" and the number 3 fuel tank showed signs that it had ruptured prior to the low-altitude breakup inferred from the wreckage distribution. The vertical stabilizer showed signs that it had been struck by \\"at least one body and possibly some seats,\\" and the horizontal stabilizer also showed signs of being impacted by debris in the air. Many bodies were not recovered, possibly because they had been ejected very early in this sequence. Without being able to better examine the wreckage, and lacking valid flight data from the final moments of the flight, it is not known what exactly happened after 0559 GMT. What is known is that some sort of explosive device, likely located within the passenger cabin near the right wingbox, detonated at that time, causing unknown but catastrophic damage to the airplane, including but not limited to the damage found on the horizontal and vertical stabilizer. The airplane likely descended rapidly in an \\"erratic\\" manner. At an undetermined point in this descent, the horizontal stabilizer separated from the airplane entirely, and eventually the fuselage broke into the three sections initially found by searchers.

The state religion in Pakistan is Islam, which is practiced by 96.28% of the population. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Pakistani constitution, which established a fundamental right of Pakistani citizens, irrespective of their religion, to equal rights.Information on other countries: http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf The remaining 4% practice Hinduism, Christianity, Ahmadis, Sikhism, Bah√° º√≠ Faith and other religions. Muslims comprise a number of sects: the majority practice Sunni Islam (estimated at 75‚Äì95%), while 5‚Äì15% Shia Islam. Nearly all Pakistani Sunni Muslims belong to the Hanafi Islamic law school. The majority of Pakistani Shia Muslims belong to the Twelver Islamic law school, with significant minority groups who practice Ismailism, which is composed of Nizari (Aga Khanis), Mustaali, Dawoodi Bohra, Sulaymani, and others. Religious minorities in Pakistan often face significant discrimination, subject to issues such as violence and misuse of the blasphemy law. It is claimed that since 1947, religious minorities went from 23% to 3.7% of the population, due to mass migration of nearly 5 million Hindus and Sikhs to India in 1947 and separation of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1971 which contained nearly 22% of minorities of Pakistan leaving behind approximately 1.6% of minorities in West Pakistan. As per the census in 1998, there were less than 2.5 million Hindus in Pakistan. The Pakistan Hindu Council puts the population at an estimated 8 million as of Oct 2019. Constitutional provisions The Constitution of Pakistan establishes Islam as the state religion, and provides that all citizens have the right to profess, practice and propagate their religion subject to law, public order, and morality. The Constitution also states that all laws are to conform with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah. The Constitution limits the political rights of Pakistan's non-Muslims. Only Muslims are allowed to become the President or the Prime Minister.The Constitution of Pakistan, Notes for Part III, Chapter 3 Only Muslims are allowed to serve as judges in the Federal Shariat Court, which has the power to strike down any law deemed un Islamic, though its judgments can be overruled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. However, non- Muslims have served as judges in the High Courts and Supreme Court. In 2019, Naveed Amir, a Christian member of National assembly moved a bill to amend the article 41 and 91 of the Constitution which would allow non-Muslims to become Prime Minister and President of Pakistan. However Pakistan‚Äôs parliament blocked the bill The focus of Islamic principles creates a system of institutionalised discrimination that filters down into society. Moreover, the Constitution sets up an Islamic Council, tasked with ensuring Islamic ideology is followed in governmental decisions, actions and policy making. Demographics of religion in Pakistan Based on information collected from the Library of Congress, CIA World Factbook, Oxford University, University of Pennsylvania, U.S. State Department and others, the following is a list of estimations about the percentage of people professing different faiths in the country. These estimations vary considerably from source to source, depending on methods of research and databases that were used. As of 2012, around 5,900,000 non-Muslim Pakistanis held a Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC card) from the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), which can only be obtained by citizens over 18 years of age. It is estimated that about 96% adult Pakistanis currently hold CNIC cards, and therefore the total adult population of non-Muslim religions seems to be over 3 million. Of the minority CNIC holders, 1,414,527 were Hindus (769,647 males and 644,880 females), 1,270,051 were Christians (731,713 males and 538,338 females), 125,681 were Ahmadi Muslims (63,479 males and 62,202 females), 33,734 were Bah√° º√≠s, 6,146 were Sikhs, 4,020 were Parsis, 1,492 were Buddhist and 66,898 were others (such as Kalasha Animists). NADRA makes it nearly impossible to declare and change the religion to anything from Islam making the statistics somewhat misleading. Islam The shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar The Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, which is the largest mosque of Pakistan and is also one of the largest in the world, was built by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. Islam is the state religion of Pakistan, and about 95-98% of Pakistanis are Muslim. Pakistan has the second largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia. The majority are Sunni (estimated at 75-95%), with an estimated 5-20% Shia. A PEW survey in 2012 found that 6% of Pakistani Muslims were Shia. There are a number of Islamic law schools called Madhab (schools of jurisprudence), which are called fiqh or 'Maktab-e-Fikr' in Urdu. Nearly all Pakistani Sunni Muslims belong to the Hanafi Islamic school of thought, while a small number belong to the Hanbali school. The majority of Pakistani Shia Muslims belong to the Twelver (Ithna Asharia) branch, with significant minority who adhere to Ismailism branch that is composed of Nizari (Aga Khanis), Mustaali, Dawoodi Bohra, Sulaymani, and others. Sufis and above mentioned Sunni and Shia sects are considered to be Muslims according to the Constitution of Pakistan. The mosque is an important religious as well as social institution in Pakistan.Malik, Jamal. Islam in South Asia: A Short History. Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008. Many rituals and ceremonies are celebrated according to Islamic calendar. =Sufi= Islam to some extent syncretized with pre-Islamic influences, resulting in a religion with some traditions distinct from those of the Arab world. Two Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Ali Hajweri in Lahore (ca. 11th century) and Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan, Sindh (ca. 12th century). Sufism, a mystical Islamic tradition, promoted by Fariduddin Ganjshakar in Pakpatan, has a long history and a large popular following in Pakistan. Popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance. Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticize its popular character, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, 5 in 2010 that killed 64 people. Other religions =Hinduism= Shri Hinglaj Mata temple shakti peetha is the largest Hindu pilgrimage centre in Pakistan. The annual Hinglaj Yathra is attended by more than 250,000 people. Hinduism is the second largest religion in Pakistan after Islam, according to the 1998 Census. , Pakistan had the fifth largest Hindu population in the world and PEW predicts that by 2050 Pakistan will have the fourth largest Hindu population in the world. According to the 1998 Census,the Hindu population was found to be 2,111,271 (including 332,343 scheduled castes Hindus). The Religious data of 2017 Census has not been released. Hindus are found in all provinces of Pakistan but are mostly concentrated in Sindh. About 93% of Hindus live in Sindh, 5% in Punjab and nearly 2% in Balochistan. They speak a variety of languages such as Sindhi, Seraiki, Aer, Dhatki, Gera, Goaria, Gurgula, Jandavra, Kabutra, Koli, Loarki, Marwari, Sansi, Vaghri and Gujarati. Before the Mughal Empire and Delhi Sultanate, around 90% of the population was Hindu. There are reports of Hindus being converted to Islam by force and threat. The Rig Veda, the oldest Hindu text, was believed to have been composed in the Punjab province of modern-day Pakistan on the banks of the Indus River around 1500 BCE and spread from there across South and South East Asia slowly developing and evolving into the various forms of the faith we see today. Cases collected by Global Human Rights Defence show that underage Hindu (and Christian) girls are often targeted by Muslims for forced conversion to Islam. According to the National Commission of Justice and Peace and the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) around 1,000 non-muslim minority women are converted to Islam and then forcibly married off to their abductors or rapists. =Christianity= Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore Christians () make up 1.6% of Pakistan's population. The majority of the Pakistani Christian community consists of Punjabis who converted during the British colonial era and their descendants. Pakistani Christians mainly live in Punjab and in urban centres. There is also a Roman Catholic community in Karachi which was established by Goan and Tamil migrants when Karachi's infrastructure was being developed between the two World Wars. A few Protestant groups conduct missions in Pakistan. There are a number of church-run schools in Pakistan that admit students of all religions, including Forman Christian College, St. Patrick's Institute of Science & Technology and Saint Joseph's College for Women, Karachi. Cases collected by Global Human Rights Defence show that young underage Christian (and Hindu) girls are often targeted by Muslims for forced conversion to Islam. Christians also often face abuses of Pakistani blasphemy laws, notably in the case of Asia Bibi. =Ahmadiyya= Yadgar Mosque, the first mosque of Rabwah According to the last Census in Pakistan, Ahmadi made up 0.22% of the population; however, the Ahmadiyya community boycotted the census. Independent groups generally estimate the population to be somewhere between two and five million Ahmadis. In media reports, four million is the most commonly cited figure.The 1998 Pakistani census states that there are 291,000 (0.22%) Ahmadis in Pakistan. However, the Ahmadiyya Muslim community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be somewhere between 2 million and 5 million Ahmadis. However, the 4 million figure is the most quoted figure and is approximately 2.2% of the country.

Westport 2002, page 52 * In 1974, the government of Pakistan amended the Constitution of Pakistan to define a Muslim according to Qu'ran 33:40, as a person who believes in finality of Prophet Muhammad under the Ordinance XX. According to Ordinance XX, Ahmadis cannot call themselves Muslim or \\"pose as Muslims\\" which is punishable by three years in prison. Ahmadis believe in Muhammad as the best and the last law bearing prophet and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the Messiah of Muslims. Consequently, Ahmadis were declared non-Muslims by a parliamentary tribunal. =Bah√° º√≠= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Pakistan begins previous to its independence when it was still under British colonial rule. The roots of the religion in the region go back to the first days of the B√°b√≠ religion in 1844, with Shaykh Sa'id Hindi who was from Multan. During Bah√°'u'll√°h's lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to the area that is current-day Pakistan. The Bah√° º√≠s in Pakistan have the right to hold public meetings, establish academic centers, teach their faith, and elect their administrative councils. Bah√°'√≠ sources claim their population to be around 30,000. =Sikhism= Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in Punjab, Pakistan is a famous pilgrimage site for Sikhs In the 15th century, the reformist Sikh movement originated in Punjab region in undivided India where Sikhism's founder, as well as most of the faiths disciples, originated from. There are a number of Sikhs living throughout Pakistan today; estimates vary, but the number is thought to be on the order of 20,000. In recent years, their numbers have increased with many Sikhs migrating from neighboring Afghanistan who have joined their co-religionists in Pakistan. The shrine of Guru Nanak Dev is located in Nankana Sahib near the city of Lahore where many Sikhs from all over the world make pilgrimage to this and other shrines. =Zoroastrianism= Bai Virbaiji Soparivala Parsi School, Karachi There are at least 4,000 Pakistani citizen practicing the Zoroastrian religion. With the flight of Zoroastrians from Greater Iran into India, the Parsi communities were established. More recently, from the 15th century onwards, Zorastrians came to settle the coast of Sindh and have established thriving communities and commercial enterprises. These newer migrants were to be called Parsi. At the time of independence of Pakistan in 1947, Karachi and Lahore were home to a thriving Parsi business community. Karachi had the most prominent population of Parsis in Pakistan. After independence, many migrated abroad but a number remained. Parsis have entered Pakistani public life as social workers, business folk, journalists and diplomats. The most prominent Parsis of Pakistan today include Ardeshir Cowasjee, Byram Dinshawji Avari, Jamsheed Marker, as well as Minocher Bhandara. The founding father of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, married Ratti Bai who belonged to a Parsi family before her conversion to Islam. =Kalash= Guardians of a Kalasha village in the valley of Mumuret (Bumburet) The Kalash people practise a form of ancient Hinduism mixed with animism. Adherents of the Kalash religion number around 3,000 and inhabit three remote valleys in Chitral; Bumboret, Rumbur and Birir. Their religion is probably related to Hinduism, but may be related to the Greek and Macedonian Pagan religion. It is more similar to very early (Rigvedic) Hinduism, than later forms of Hinduism. =Jainism= Jain Temple of Bhodesar Jainism existed in Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, before the partition in 1947, and even for several years after the partition. There is no evidence of any Jains living in Pakistan today, although it is claimed that a few still live in Sindh and Punjab provinces. They are number of disused Jain Temples found in different parts of Pakistan. Gulu Lalvani, a famous Jain, was originally from Pakistan but he, like other Jains, emigrated from Pakistan. Baba Dharam Das Tomb is also found in Pakistan. The Jain temple at Gori in Tharparkar was a major Jain pilgrimage center. The Jain Mandir Chowk at Lahore was the site of a Digambar Jain Temple. The memorial of Jain seer Vijayanandsuri at Gujranwala is now a police station. =Buddhism= Buddhism has an ancient history in Pakistan; currently there is a small community of at least 1500 Pakistani Buddhist in the country. The country is dotted with numerous ancient and disused Buddhist stupas along the entire breadth of the Indus River that courses through the heart of the country. Many Buddhist empires and city states existed, notably in Gandhara but also elsewhere in Taxila, Punjab and Sindh. The number of Buddhist voters was 1,884 in 2017 and are mostly concentrated in Sindh and Punjab. =Judaism= Various estimates suggest that there were about 1,500 Jews living in Pakistan at the time of its independence on 14 August 1947, with the majority living in Karachi and a few living in Peshawar. However, almost all emigrated to Israel after 1948. There are a few disused synagogues in both cities; while one Karachi synagogue was torn down for the construction of a shopping mall. The one in Peshawar still exists, although the building is not being used for any religious purpose. There is a small Jewish community of Pakistani origin settled in Ramla, Israel. One Pakistani, Faisal Khalid (a.k.a. Fishel Benkhald) of Karachi claims to be Pakistan's only Jew. He claimed that his mother is Jewish (making him Jewish by Jewish custom) but, his father is a Muslim. Pakistani authorities have issued him a passport which stated Judaism as his religion and have allowed him to travel to Israel. =Irreligion= There are people who do not profess any faith (such as atheists and agnostics) in Pakistan, but their numbers are not known. They are particularly in the affluent areas of the larger cities. Some were born in secular families while others in religious ones. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population, but social pressure against claiming no religion was strong. A 2012 study by Gallup Pakistan found that people not affiliated to any religion account for 1% of the population.http://www.gallup.com.pk/Polls/240712.pdf Many atheists in Pakistan have been lynched and imprisoned over unsubstantiated allegations of blasphemy. When the state initiated a full-fledged crackdown on atheism since 2017, it has become worse with secular bloggers being kidnapped and the government running advertisements urging people to identify blasphemers among them and the highest judges declaring such people to be terrorists.

Catholic Bishops of Great Britain, Sacristy Press, 2016, p. 120 Biography Alexander Goss was born at Ormskirk, Lancashire of recusant background, connected on both sides with old Lancashire families who had always been Catholics; his father was descended from the Gooses or Gosses, his mother from the Rutters. His maternal uncle, the well-known priest, Rev. Henry Rutter, sent him to Ushaw College, 20 June 1827, where he distinguished himself as a student. When be had completed his philosophy course he was appointed as a \\"minor professor\\" to teach one of the classes in the humanity schools. On the death of his uncle, he spent the legacy he received, in going to Rome, where he studied theology at the English College, and was ordained priest on 4 July 1841. On his return to England, early in March, 1842, he was sent to St. Wilfrids Church, Manchester, but in the following October he was appointed vice-president of the newly founded college of St. Edward, Everton, near Liverpool. Fr. Goss held this office until he was chosen coadjutor-bishop to Dr. Brown, ten years later. He was consecrated by Cardinal Wiseman, at Liverpool, 25 September 1853, and as there was no pressing need of his services, he took the opportunity to pay a long visit to Rome. From 1853 he was Titular Bishop of Geras until, on 25 January 1856, he became Bishop of Liverpool by the death of Dr. Brown. In politics, he followed the Conservative Party. Under his firm administration, Catholicity made great advances, many churches and schools were built, and the bishop proved an unflinching champion of Catholic education. His fearless denunciation of social evils, and his outspoken expression of opinion attracted the notice of the Press, and even The Times devoted special attention to his speeches. Affiliations He was an accomplished scholar, not only in theology, but also in arch√¶ology, and he was an active member of the Chetham Holbein and Manx societies. For the first he edited \\"Abbott's Journal\\" and \\"The Tryalls at Manchester in 1694\\" (1864); for the Manx Society, Chronica Regum Manni√¶ et Insularum, to which he made valuable additions. An account of Harkirke burial-ground for recusants, and an introduction written by him were published by the Chetham Society in Crosby Records (M.S., 12, 1887). He collected materials for a history of Catholicity in the north, and edited Claude-Joseph Drioux's \\"Sacred History, comprising the leading facts of the Old and New Testament\\". For many years he suffered so much that his friend, Rev. T.E. Gibson, wrote of him (Lydiate Hall and its Associations, Introd.): \\"A prey to disease during the greater part of his episcopate, his life was the struggle of a fearless soul with bodily ailments and with the harassing mental anxieties incidental to his position.\\" Bishop Goss died suddenly at St. Edward's College on 3 October 1872, aged 58. There are two paintings of the bishop at St. Edward's College, Liverpool.

Life Wilder's father was a printer. Raymond was musically inclined. He played cornet in the family orchestra, which performed at dances and fairs, and accompanied silent films on the piano. He entered Brown University in 1914, intending to become an actuary. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Navy as an ensign. Brown awarded him his first degree in 1920, and a master's degree in actuarial mathematics in 1921. That year, he married Una Maude Greene; they had four children, thanks to whom they have ample descent. Wilder chose to do his Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin, the most fateful decision of his life. At Texas, Wilder discovered pure mathematics and topology, thanks to the remarkable influence of Robert Lee Moore, the founder of topology in the US and the inventor of the Moore method for teaching mathematical proof. Moore was initially unimpressed by the young actuary, but Wilder went on to solve a difficult open problem that Moore had posed to his class. Moore suggested Wilder write up the solution for his Ph.D. thesis, which he did in 1923, titling it Concerning Continuous Curves. Wilder thus became the first of Moore's many doctoral students at the University of Texas. After a year as an instructor at Texas, Wilder was appointed assistant professor at the Ohio State University in 1924. That university required that its academic employees sign a loyalty oath, which Wilder was very reluctant to sign because doing so was inconsistent with his lifelong progressive political and moral views. In 1926, Wilder joined the faculty of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he supervised 26 Ph.Ds and became a Research Professor in 1947. During the 1930s, he helped settle European refugee mathematicians in the United States. Mathematicians who rubbed shoulders with Wilder at Michigan and who later proved prominent included Samuel Eilenberg, the cofounder of category theory, and the topologist Norman Steenrod. After his 1967 retirement from Michigan at the rather advanced age of 71, Wilder became a research associate and occasional lecturer at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Wilder was vice president of the American Mathematical Society, 1950‚Äì1951, president 1955‚Äì1956, and the Society's Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer in 1969. He was president of the Mathematical Association of America, 1965‚Äì1966, which awarded him its Distinguished Service Medal in 1973.MAA presidents: Raymond Louis Wilder He was elected to the American National Academy of Sciences in 1963. Brown University (1958) and the University of Michigan (1980) awarded him honorary doctorates. The mathematics department at the University of California annually bestows one or more graduating seniors with an award in Wilder's name. The historical, philosophical, and anthropological writings of Wilder's later years suggest a warm, colorful personality. Raymond (2003) attests to this having been the case. For instance: : \\"[Wilder] was a devoted student of southwestern Native American culture. One day he told me that after retiring he would like to be a bartender in a rural area of Arizona or New Mexico, because he found the stories of the folk he met in bars there so fascinating.\\" The topologist Wilder's thesis set out a new approach to the Sch√∂nflies programme, which aimed to study positional invariants of sets in the plane or 2-sphere. A positional invariant of a set A with respect to a set B is a property shared by all homeomorphic images of A contained in B. The best known example of such a positional invariant is embodied in the Jordan curve theorem: A simple closed curve in the 2-sphere has precisely two complementary domains and is the boundary of each of them. A converse to the Jordan curve theorem, proved by Sch√∂nflies, states that a subset of the 2-sphere is a simple closed curve if it: * Has two complementary domains; * Is the boundary of each of these domains; * Is accessible from each of these domains. In his \\"A converse of the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem in three dimensions\\" (1930), Wilder showed that a subset of Euclidean 3-space whose complementary domains satisfied certain homology conditions was a 2-sphere. Around 1930, Wilder moved from set-theoretic topology to algebraic topology, calling in 1932 for the unification of the two areas. He then began an extensive investigation of the theory of manifolds, e.g., his \\"Generalized closed manifolds in n-space\\" (1934), in effect extending the Sch√∂nflies programme to higher dimensions. This work culminated in his Topology of Manifolds (1949), twice reprinted, whose last three chapters discuss his contributions to the theory of positional topological invariants. The philosopher During the 1940s, Wilder met and befriended the University of Michigan anthropologist Leslie White, whose professional curiosity included mathematics as a human activity (White 1947). This encounter proved fateful, and Wilder's research interests underwent a major change, towards the foundations of mathematics. This change was foreshadowed by his 1944 article \\"The nature of mathematical proof,\\" and heralded by his address to the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians, titled \\"The cultural basis of mathematics,\\" which posed the questions: *\\"How does culture (in its broadest sense) determine a mathematical structure, such as a logic?\\" *\\"How does culture influence the successive stages of the discovery of a mathematical structure?\\" In 1952, he wrote up his course on foundations and the philosophy of mathematics into a widely cited text, Introduction to the foundations of mathematics. Wilder's Evolution of mathematical concepts. An elementary study (1969) proposed that \\"we study mathematics as a human artifact, as a natural phenomenon subject to empirical observation and scientific analysis, and, in particular, as a cultural phenomenon understandable in anthropological terms.\\" In this book, Wilder wrote: :\\"The major difference between mathematics and the other sciences, natural and social, is that whereas the latter are directly restricted in their purview by environmental phenomena of a physical or social nature, mathematics is subject only indirectly to such limitations. ... Plato conceived of an ideal universe in which resided perfect models ... the only reality mathematical concepts have is as cultural elements or artifacts.\\" Wilder's last book, Mathematics as a cultural system (1981), contained yet more thinking in this anthropological and evolutionary vein. Wilder's eclectic and humanist perspective on mathematics appears to have had little influence on subsequent mathematical research. It has, however, had some influence on the teaching of mathematics and on the history and philosophy of mathematics. In particular, Wilder can be seen as a precursor to the work of Howard Eves, Evert Willem Beth, and Davis and Hersh (1981). Wilder's call for mathematics to be scrutinized by the methods of social science anticipates some aspects of Where Mathematics Comes From, by George Lakoff and Rafael Nunez.

During 1980-1981, the existing cellblocks constructed during the second half of the 19th century were replaced by four (later five) modular housing units. A new administrative complex and an EPA-approved multi-fuel power plant were also completed at the same time. An existing dormitory building constructed in the 1950s was retained as a medium security facility and two new 100 bed dormitory units were opened in 1998. A thirty-six bed control unit also built in the 1950s continues in use as a high security segregation facility. The Industries Plant, Laundry and other support buildings were retained from the older facility as well. The inmate population at the NSP typically consists of offenders aged 21 years and above, serving medium to longer sentences. The Nebraska State Penitentiary uses the Unit Management concept designed to improve control and staff/inmate relationships by dividing the larger institution population into smaller, more manageable groups and to improve and personalize the delivery of rehabilitative services. The NSP has been accredited by the American Correctional Association since 1985.

Hosted by experienced radio performer Garry Moore, the series helped launch the careers of many comedic talents, such as Dorothy Loudon, Don Adams, George Gobel, Carol Burnett, Don Knotts, Lee Goodman, James Kirkwood, Jr., Lily Tomlin, and Jonathan Winters. The Garry Moore Show garnered a number of Emmy nominations and wins. Origins The show originally started as a radio program; CBS eventually awarded Moore his own early-evening television show in its place. His radio partner since 1940, Durward Kirby, made the move to TV with him, and appeared throughout all three versions of the TV show. Original version (1950‚Äì1958) The first incarnation of the show began in June 1950 as a Monday-through-Friday, 30-minute evening series. It was also simulcast on radio. The show changed to a once-weekly, one-hour format by August. Another prime time edition, The Garry Moore Evening Show, alternated with The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show on Thursday nights from September through December 1951. In the fall of 1950, Moore moved to a daytime show on CBS, at first in the early afternoon and later in mid-morning. The series featured a relaxed and flexible combination of comedy skits, monologues, singing, and interaction with the studio audience. It was an important commercial success for CBS, and ran in this format until mid-1958. Second version (1958‚Äì1964) In 1958, Moore ended the previous show because of his demanding work schedule, but he returned in the fall with a weekly, hour-long evening series, with the same title and similar format. Allen Funt's Candid Camera segments became a regular feature of this series, along with a lengthy recap segment called \\"That Wonderful Year\\". In 1959, Moore produced two LP records on the Warner Bros. label, That Wonderful Year, 1930 and That Wonderful Year, 1940. In its first season, this version of The Garry Moore Show faced competition on NBC from the drama series with a Western setting, The Californians, and the ABC crime/police reality show, Confession, hosted by Jack Wyatt. Larry Blyden with Carol Burnett, 1960 The cast of the second version included Marion Lorne (who appeared as her other Broadway and acting commitments permitted throughout this run), and rising star Carol Burnett (1959‚Äì62), who honed her comedic skills for her own future successful variety show. In addition to the performances of the cast and guests, vocal performers included the George Becker Singers and the dancers under the choreography of Ernest Flatt, including lead dancer Don Crichton. Bob Banner was the executive producer, Joe Hamilton (Burnett's future husband) was series producer, and Irwin Kostal was the orchestra leader. In the summer of 1960, the series was replaced for nine weeks by the Patrick O'Neal medical/police drama Diagnosis: Unknown. The Garry Moore Show was removed from the CBS line-up in 1964, at Moore's request, to take a long-needed vacation which lasted more than two years.Moore, Garry. I've Got A Secret, September 5, 1966. Final version (1966‚Äì1967) Moore returned with yet another version of the show in the fall of 1966, this time it was in color. Due to very tough competition from Bonanza on NBC, the show was cancelled after only four months. It was replaced on the CBS schedule by The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Episodes on DVD As of 2012, at least four episodes of the second version of the show are available on DVD. - The Garry Moore Show Presents: A Carol Burnett Christmas (2012) features the Christmas episodes from 1959, 1960, and 1961. Guests included Mahalia Jackson and Henry Morgan (1959), Jonathan Winters and Louise O'Brien (1960), and Julie Andrews and Gwen Verdon (1961). The 1961 show includes Julie's earliest televised recording of \\"My Favorite Things\\", three years before filming The Sound of Music. - The Carol Burnett Show: Carol's Favorites (2012) includes as a bonus feature the March 6, 1962, episode where Burnett, playing Supergirl, delivers her first televised \\"Tarzan yell\\". The episode guests included Alan King and Barbara McNair, and a peek at the end credits shows how a lot of the production and writing staff on whom she relied during her own show came from those with whom she worked The Garry Moore Show.

The town is named after one of its most abundant natural resources in the area, apatite, the raw mineral used in the production of phosphorus mineral fertilizers. Population: History The passing loop of Bely () on the Leningrad-Murmansk Railway was built in 1926 and the settlement of Apatity was founded in 1930.

Consequently, the Murmansk Oblast Executive Committee subordinated a part of the territory in Kirovsk's jurisdiction to the new town by the decision of October 13, 1966. By the November 29, 1979 Decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, Kovdorsky District was formed from the parts of the territory in Apatity's jurisdiction. The work settlement of Polyarnye Zori subordinated to Apatity was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction by another Decree of April 22, 1991.

His nickname is Utchan (\\"Wutchan\\"), and his partner, Kiyotaka Nanbara, is known as Nanchan. He was born on July 22, 1964 in Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto. Though he has worked for years as a comedian, he has also shown talent as an actor and dramatic performer. He is well known as the leader of the owarai band NO PLAN. History Uchimura met Nanbara while attending the Yokohama Broadcasting Technical School, along with Tetsur≈ç Degawa and Masato Irie, who were also classmates. The two decided to start a manzai duo, and they were called Utchan Nanchan by their teacher, Keiko Utsumi. They first appeared on the show Owarai sutaa tanj≈ç!! („ÅäÁ¨ë„ÅÑ„Çπ„Çø„ÉºË™ïÁîü!!, Birth of a Comedy Star!). They won the competition the following year, and picked up the ny≈´ kombi (new duo) award the next year. In 1992, Utchan Nanchan won the Japanese Academy Award for \\"Best New Actors\\" for their roles in the movie Cult Seven (‰∏É‰∫∫„ÅÆ„Åä„Åü„Åè). In 1993 Hong Kong singer Wong Ka Kui died after both he and Uchimura fell off a broken stage on Utchan Nanchan TV show. In addition, the TV program Uchimura Produce(ÂÜÖÊùë„Éó„É≠„Éá„É•„Éº„Çπ) which he was the producer of in 2000 won popularity. Criticisms followed that the Japanese were having too many late night shows of this type, and the TV station crews were overworked. Uchimura announced his engagement to and married former TV announcer Yumi Tokunaga in 2005. On January 28, 2006, his debut film as a director, PEANUTS, was released. Character Uchimura is said to have been often teased about his pallid skin color and big nose. He was supposedly often teased as a youth with taunts like, \\"With skin as white as yours, why don't you become a kabuki actor?\\". At the same time, he was called a child prodigy after placing 8th in a local prefectural swimming tournament, leading his school's softball team to a municipal semifinal win, while also competing in baseball and kendo. He loves the countryside in his hometown prefecture of Kumamoto, and frequently appears on local television, and writes articles for his hometown newspaper twice a year. He is said to resemble Jackie Chan and has parodied him many times in comedy routines. Therefore, he is called \\"Chan\\"(\\"chen\\") by Tetsur≈ç Degawa.

The city was liberated from Ottoman rule on 23 November 1877 by the Romanian Army under the command of the Imperial Russian Army. Kozloduy is best known for the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, Bulgaria's only (as of January 2018) nuclear power plant, which is located nearby, as well as the second-largest Bulgarian Danubian island, Kozloduy Island. The city is also known for the ship Radetski, the boat in which the poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and with 200 others crossed the Danube River in a final attempt to gather an army and liberate Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire. History The earliest official data show that Kozloduy was populated in the 16th century. It is in the burial mounds where traces of a Thracian dwelling center that existed in the first millennium BC remain. Later on the big Roman roadway along the Danube passed through these places. The remains of the Roman castella (i.e. castles) Magura piatra (or RegianumAn inventory of Roman Republican coin hoards and coins from Bulgaria (IRRCHBulg) by Eugeni I. Paunov,IliÔ∏†aÔ∏° Prokopov,2008,,page 80), Camistrum and Augusta testify to this. In this region there are three historic trenches which were later called Lomski, Ostrovski and Kozloduiski where a military garrison of Khan Asparukh was placed. In the 18th century the settlement was marked as Kotozluk and Kozludere (\\"a low coomb\\") and later Kozloduy (\\"an angle of ice blocks\\"). On 17 May 1876 Hristo Botev's detachment landed at Kozloduy on the Radetski steamer. On 23 November 1877 the 8th cavalry regiment under Commander Alexandru Perets liberated Kozloduy from the Ottomans. This cavalry was part of the Romanian Forces under the command of the Russian Imperial Army. Construction of Kozloduy actually started with the construction of the first Nuclear Electric Power Station, which was started on 6 April 1970. Location The town is situated on the Danube river, which is the European Transport Corridor No.7. It is 80 km from the province center Vratsa and 200 km from the capital Sofia. The Municipality consists of 5 populated centers. The town and 4 villages - Butan, Harlets, Glojene and Kriva Bara. Economics and business The municipality is one of the richest in Vratsa province (after Vratsa Municipality) and has a standard of living above the average for Bulgaria. The town is one of the best places in Bulgaria for entrepreneurship and starting business, as many qualified personnel from other parts of Bulgaria come to Kozloduy due to the Nuclear Power Plant. Kozloduy has a strategic location near transport corridors N.7, N.5, N.8 and N.9. Two large companies, one each in the construction and electronics sectors, are based in the town. Twin towns - sister cities Kozloduy is twinned with: * Bechet, Romania * Bosilegrad, Serbia * Calafat, Romania * Whitehaven, England, United Kingdom Population Despite a steady population decline, Kozloduy is currently the second most populous city in the Vratsa Province (Vratsa is the first) with some 13,800 residents. Bulgarians make up the largest ethnic group, followed by residents of Turkish, Roma, Russian and Romanian background. Kozloduy has also attracted foreign visitors, as many nuclear power-related seminars are held in the town. Honors Kozloduy Cove in Robert Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Kozloduy.

Since the eighties, he has produced monumental installations accompanied by artist books addressing the mutability of meaning and intertextuality. The late nineties marked a turning point for Dunning when he began in-depth research into immersive environments in virtual reality. \\"Since 1987, Dunning has been using a computer to gather an impressive bank of images and texts that he then disseminates according to parameters determined randomly. His installations revisit the \\"all-over\\" strategy in a conceptual form and often occupy a gallery's entire wall surface. Visitors simultaneously perceive the singularity of the details and the overall effect produced by their display. Yet the excess signifiers do not negate the narrative structure woven between all the elements\\". The cycle of installations in The Einstein's Brain Project (1995‚Äì2001) is a major technological shift for Dunning that, nonetheless, re- examines his past conceptual concerns. In this project, beginning in 1995 with Paul Woodrow and a team of scientists from different fields, Dunning probes the new epistemological models that have developed thanks to technological advances in virtual reality. Currently, Dunning is working on a project with working title (WIW), Worlds in Worlds. Dunning plans to put together an immersive environment whose boundaries will be defined by the real dimensions of the room the participant is in. Dunning's interest in an Anatomically Lifelike Biological Interface, which operates via a model reproducing certain bio-anatomical functions, is leading him to pursue research on the properties of ferrofluids, liquid matter that can be altered by an electromagnetic field and modified by biological signals from the human body. In 2002 the Daniel Langlois Foundation supported \\"Representations of the Body in Liquid Media Spaces\\", Alan Dunning's \\"technical and conceptual research into developing an interface prototype that places the human body in a discursive and media space without relinquishing the body's materiality\\".

He is considered a martyr because of his defence of an innocent thrall woman. His religious feast day is 15 May. The connection of St. Hallvard to the city of Oslo was evidenced by the fact that his image was recorded in the city's seal since the Middle Ages. The municipality's highest honor, the St. Hallvard Medal (St. Hallvard-medaljen), was named after him in 1950. Background Little is known of his life, and all traditional stories relate to his death near Drammen. Although the exact year of birth and place of his birth are unknown, he is commonly believed to have been born ca. 1020 According to tradition, his father was the farmer Vebj√∏rn. His parents were wealthy farmers and owned the farm Husaby in Lier. His mother, Torny Gudbrandsdatter, was reportedly related to St. Olaf, the patron saint of Norway. It is said that she was the daughter of Gudbrand Kula from Oppland, who was also the father of √Östa Gudbrandsdatter, St. Olaf's mother. Ruins of St. Hallvard's Cathedral in Oslo St Hallvard. Nidaros Cathedral Death Hallvard defended a pregnant woman, most likely a thrall, who had been given sanctuary from three men accusing her of theft. Hallvard believed in her innocence and took her on his boat. Hallvard, together with the woman, were killed by arrows from the men. The woman was buried on the beach. Hallvard, however, was bound with a millstone around his neck, and the men attempted to sink his body in Drammensfjord but it refused to remain submerged and as a result their crimes were discovered. A local village buried him in a Christian manner and people came to regard him as a martyr to their faith. Veneration Saint Hallvard St. Hallvard's Cathedral (Hallvardskatedralen) in Oslo was dedicated to his name and his remains were relocated to the facility which was finished in 1130. The Cathedral was built on the hill just north of the area that is now the Old Town market square in Oslo (intersection of Bispegata ‚ÄìOslo gate). For almost 500 years this was the most important church in the city. Besides being the bishop's seat and religious center, the cathedral was the coronation church, the royal wedding church and the royal burial chapel. The facility was in use as a church until about 1655. It fell into disrepair in the 17th century and is today a ruin situated in Minneparken. 15th May is celebrated as St. Hallvard's Day.

The depot was intended to receive broken down vehicles by train from the battlefront, repair them, and return them to service. The project was not regarded as a success. The depot was believed to be so urgent that construction work (eventually by construction company Sir Robert McAlpine) began in July 1918 without harvesting the crops on the land, but the site was still under construction when the armistice was agreed in November 1918.p 109, The History of Slough, Maxwell Fraser, Slough Corporation, 1973 Although the depot's fundamental purpose went with the end of the war, General Jan Smuts proposed a post-war use for the depot which was implemented. Rather than scrapping the many army surplus vehicles, they were sent to Slough for repair prior to sale.p. 109, The History of Slough, Maxwell Fraser, Slough Corporation, 1973 Because of this use, for many years (until at least the 1980s), the site was known locally and colloquially as 'the dump', and at the time of the depot's development it was also known as 'The White Elephant'. Relations between management and workforce were so poor (partly due to the militancy of Wal Hannington) that in April 1920 the entire workforce was sacked.Wal Hannington and the Slough Soviet 1920 The Government Surplus Disposal Board sold the 2.7 square kilometre (600 acre) site and its contents (17,000 used cars, trucks and motorcycles, and 170,000 square metres (1.8 million sq ft) of covered workshops) for over seven million pounds. Sir Percival Perry, who had effectively established the British operations of the Ford Motor Company and who had been appointed Assistant Controller of the UK government's Agricultural Machinery Department during the war, and Sir Noel Mobbs, led the group of investors who acquired the depot, establishing the Slough Trading Co. Ltd. Repair and sale of ex-army vehicles continued until 1925 when the Slough Trading Company Act was passed allowing the company (renamed Slough Estates Ltd) to establish an Industrial Estate. The existing army buildings were tenanted as factories, and additional units were built. Those on the Bath Road and Farnham Road frontages were designed with fundamentally uniform simple Art Deco offices on the front. Shared facilities were provided for workforce and employers, including a fire station, restaurant,p118, Around Slough in old photographs, Judith Hunter and Karen Hunter, Budding Books, 1998 shops and banks, a large community centre (1937) and the Slough Industrial Health Service (1947). Early businesses established on the trading estate included Citro√´n (1926), Gillette, Johnson & Johnson and High Duty Alloys.p15, Memories of Slough, True North Books, 1999 In 1932, they were joined by Mars Ltd and Berlei (UK) Limited. In late 1933 the Slough Estates Journal reported there were 'more than 150 companies' based on the estate. As the Trading Estate grew despite the depression of the 1920s and 1930s, people were attracted from all over the country to come and find work in Slough. But the fast increase in population resulted in a shortage of housing. One solution was the construction of Timbertown, an estate of wooden single storey houses built adjacent to the site occupied by the Community Centre and now occupied by Herschel Grammar School. From the outside, the houses looked like an army barracks, but inside they were spacious and comfortable ‚Äì with 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, a big kitchen and a living room. At the start, Timbertown was well cared for a popular community, with a shop, social hut and even a Sunday school. But the buildings soon started to deteriorate. The wooden houses had never been intended to be permanent and Timbertown was finally demolished in the 1930s to make way for new buildings. From the late 1950s the estate became home to Gerry Anderson's AP Films, producing a string of successful puppet series for ATV. In 1963 Ford set up Ford Advanced Vehicles on the estate to build the Ford GT40 racing sports car with design input from Eric Broadley of Lola Cars, who subsequently fell out with Ford and used the factory (which was in his company's name) to re- establish his independent operation. Ford moved to another factory on the Estate. Until 1973, the estate had a railway directly linking the factories to Britain's railway system. A passenger service ran from Paddington and Slough stations to a separate station (accessed by a spur from the main line, separate from the freight access to the estate),map V and caption, Slough to Newbury, Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2000 until 1956.picture 80 and caption, Slough: A Pictorial History, Judith Hunter & Isobel Thompson, Phillimore & Co, Chichester, 1991 In January 2008, the estate's power station was sold to Scottish and Southern Energy. As of 2018 the plant is being partially demolished for replacement by the Slough Multifuel facility, which will generate about 50 MW 'through burning waste- derived fuels made from various sources'. Geography Slough Trading Estate has a Local nature reserve on the Western border of the estate called Haymill Valley. In popular culture In 1937, English poet John Betjeman wrote his poem Slough in protest against the expansion of the Slough Trading Estate. The poem bemoans the loss of the area's rural character, and pillories English society's increasing consumerism and the sweatshop conditions caused by large- scale industrial development.

Johannes Plavius Nehus√¢ Th√ºringus\\" in some works) or Plauen (Latinized to Plavia), from which his surname was derived. At the end of 1624, he was part of a Dichterkreis (circle of poets ) in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) in Poland and called himself Magister (Master of Arts) for the first time in 1626. Danzig at the time had no university, so Plavius must have obtained his degree somewhere else, most likely Frankfurt/Oder since a Johannes Plavius Tyrigotanus (\\"Johannes Plavius Thuringian\\") is listed in the registers of the winter semester of 1621. The pastor and poet Michael Albinus in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), who was born in nearby Pr√∂bbenauin in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.Daniel Stone,A History of East Central Europe, University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 30, Google Books , later wrote that Plavius was active as a private teacher, providing basic instruction in the Latin language. He may have operated one of the small, semi-official Latin schools in Danzig; one assumes that he had received the necessary educational license, because he had written his Praecepta logicalia in 1628. He was certainly close to scholars and students in the city, and he served as an influence to Andreas Gryphius. Plavius maintained relationshops with other poets, such as Martin Opitz, Johann George Moeresius, and Peter Cr√ºger. Plavius mentions Cr√ºger in the opening letter to his Institutio Poetica. Cr√ºger dedicated an extremely laudatory poem to Plavius, which appears in the preface to the Praecepta logicalia. Plavius dedicated several poems to Susanne Nuber, the daughter of a Danzig minister. Moeresius was her brother-in-law, and Plavius dedicates some of his poems to him. These contacts were successful as Plavius may have wed Nuber by 1630. Plavius dedicated his Lehrsonnete to the councilmen of Danzig: Denen ehrenvesten und vorachtbarn herren sch√∂pffen-herren in der rechten Stat Dantzig, Hn Arnold Dilbert, Hn. Johann Roggauen, Hn. Valentin R√∂gelern, Hn. Michael Bachmann. Plavius also maintained a relationship with a wealthy brewer from Danzig named Abraham Hoewelcke (1576‚Äì1649). Plavius would later mention Hoewelcke's son in the dedication to his Praecepta logicalia as Johannes Hoeffelius ‚Äì better known as Johannes Hevelius, the astronomer.

From 1913 through 1931, he played for the Philadelphia Athletics (1913‚Äì17, 1930), Boston Red Sox (1918‚Äì20), New York Yankees (1921‚Äì25), St. Louis Browns (1926‚Äì29) and Detroit Tigers (1931). Schang was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in South Wales, New York. Career Most baseball historians agree that Wally Schang was the greatest offensive catcher of the deadball (pre-1920) era. When Schang was not catching, his managers usually played him in center field, right, or at third base, in order to keep his bat in the lineup. Schang's defensive work was also regarded as outstanding, although he holds the American League career record for most errors by a catcher, with 223. Schang was discovered by George Stallings in 1912, when he played in the sandlots of upstate New York for the Buffalo Pullmans. Schang started his major league career with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1913, who won the World Series in five games against the New York Giants and returned the next year, only to be swept by the 1914 Miracle Braves, who were managed by Schang's mentor, George Stallings. After Connie Mack sold many of his players following the 1914 Series, Schang played for three last-place Athletics teams in 1915‚Äì1917, until being sold to the Boston Red Sox before the 1918 season. Schang was the regular catcher for that club, the last Red Sox team to win the title until 2004. Soon afterwards, Boston owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. Schang followed Ruth in 1921, becoming the first in the great string of Yankee catchers, including Bill Dickey, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard and Thurman Munson. Yankees catcher Wally Schang slides safely into third base. Senators' third baseman is Ossie Bluege and pitcher backing up play is Firpo Marberry. Schang served as the Yankees' regular catcher for three straight American League pennants and was a member of the 1923 World Champion team. Three years later Schang moved again, this time to the St. Louis Browns, hitting a career-high .330 in his first season with St. Louis, as the team improved greatly, managing first- division finishes in 1928 and 1929. The following year, Schang returned to Philadelphia as a backup for Mickey Cochrane. The Athletics of 1930 were coming off a World Championship and repeated that year. It was the fourth title for Schang in his career, which ended the next season with the Detroit Tigers. In a 19-season career, Schang hit a .284 batting average with 59 home runs and 710 RBI in 1,842 games played. In 32 World Series games, he hit .287 (27-for-94) with one home run and eight RBI's. Following his major league career, Schang played for several seasons with Western Association and Canadian clubs, and then turned to managing in minor leagues. In 1945, he retired to a farm he operated at Dixon, Missouri, in the Ozark Mountains. Schang died in St Louis at age 75.

Trivia * In the early 20th century, when players with facial hair became a rarity in baseball, Wally Schang became the last major leaguer to sport a moustache, in 1914. After that, is reported that the first players to sport moustaches during the regular season were Dick Allen (St. Louis Cardinals) and Felipe Alou (Oakland Athletics), both in 1970.

This is the shell of a large sea snail from the Indian Ocean (a shell of the species Turbinella pyrum), but one that has the very rare reverse-turning spiral. When it is held with the spout (siphonal canal) pointed up, its spiral twists rightwards rather than very much more common form, which twists leftwards.  Terminology  In scientific usage a dextral (, right) shell has the opening on the right, when viewed with the spire . The opposite is sinistral (, left). This is consistent with the terms for right-handed screws in engineering and physics. Most species of sea snail are dextral, though some are naturally sinistral. Within a normally-dextral species, rare individuals may develop sinistral coiling. In religious usage, the (sacred conch shell) is displayed spire . In this orientation, a common dextral shell has its opening on the left (), and rare sinistral shell has the opening on the right ().

The true Lakshmi Shank is a rare sinistral Turbinella conch shell from the Indian Ocean, usually from Turbinella pyrum. Other right- turning sea snail shells are often mistakenly sold and worshiped in place of the genuine Shank. One common substitution is the lightning whelk (Sinistrofulgur perversum, previously named Busycon perversum) from the Atlantic coast of North America. The real Shank has 3 to 7 ridges or plaits on its columella, whereas whelk shells do not have such plaits. The so-called \\"flower-bud opening test\\", and the \\"rice pulling test\\" (Valampuri said to rise up through a rice heap) are non scientific. The best authenticity test is to take an X-ray image of the Valampuri. Valampuries do show some morphological variation depending on origin, and shells with mixed characters of two adjacent localities are also seen. In South India, people trust only the Rameshwaram type of Valampuries, and do not trust other varieties from West Coast and Bay of Bengal, though these are also the true Valampuries. In South India, people specifically worship 'Gauri Valampuri'. This Valampuri shows presence of small dark spots on its body whorl, near the conch cavity. These dots are of conch skin i.e. of periostrachum attached firmly in very small ditch or cavities, and difficult to remove. Firmly attached dark periostrachum sometimes is seen in conch sutures. However, this type of Valampuri is very rare in its occurrence and is much expensive as compared to other types.  Origin  Genuine Dakshinavarti Lakshmi Conches are only found in the Indian Ocean, between Myanmar (Burma) all the way to Sri Lanka. There are three main localities of this shankh in India. Shells from all the localities show definite morphological variations. The three localities are the Indian Ocean near Ram Setu, Sri Lanka, Ramishwaram to Tuticorin. Shells from this region are rare in occurrence. The second locality is Arabian Sea or Western India. The third locality is Bay of Bengal. Varieties showing mixed characters have also been observed. The imitation (Lightning Whelks) mostly come from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. This imitation is also known as African Valampuri. Other than busyconid species, few other species showing presence of folds in the cavity are wrongly mentioned as Dakshinavarti. These species though sinistral are different species. Having folds does not mean that they are all species under the genus Turbinella Linn.  Rarity  There are different varieties of Valampuri shells based on their locality. The three main localities are Rameshwar, Ram Setu, Sri Lanka. The second one is West Coast of India or Arabian Sea and third one is Bay of Bengal. All the three types show variation. Real Lakshmi Conch (right side spinning) are estimated to occur only one per 100,000 conch shells. The shell of the lightning whelk on the other hand almost always opens on the right (when viewed with the siphonal canal pointing upwards). Valampuries with five plaits or folds in its cavity are known as 'Panchajanya' and are very rare. Most of the Indian Valampuries show presence of orange coloured inner lip. We may also get Valampuries with Orange Brown innerlip. Valampuries with Orange coloured stripes on its main body whorl are also seen. Completely milky-white Valampuries are also very rare and expensive. Gauri Valampuries showing presence of dark brown or black spots near its cavity on main body whorl are also very rare and expensive. Giant Valampuries more than 5 kg are extremely rare in occurrence. Valampuries more than 3 feet in length are reported.  Powers ascribed  The Lakshmi Conch is said to bring all manner of blessing, but particularly material wealth, upon the owner. Ritual use may include bathing deities, drinking from the conch, or the use of mantras oriented to goddess Lakshmi. It is a wonderful object for Vastu purpose giving high positive energy.  Current value  A true Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy shell may be sold on weight basis, but at the same times it can also be sold per piece. The present market cost in India falls in the range of Rs. 18000/- to Rs. 35000/- per gram. However, there have been some reports that pure milky white Ast Laxmi shell with 8 valleys and pink lines, is also sold up to Rs. 35000/- per gram. Based upon a market search, price was average of Indian Valampuri/ Dakshinavarthy depending on size, type, quality and Ignorance of Indian Buyers price can be much higher. Tiny dwarf Valampuries / Dakshinavarthy small enough to wear as a pendant are very rare and price is negotiable when available. Tiny Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy are practically not available and people are often being cheated by selling Sinistral Land Snail in the name of Tiny Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy. It may be noted certain cartels working in Tamil Nadu and South India are creating an artificial shortage of Valampuri / Dakshinavarti Shells and are fooling common people by charging exorbitant prices, Customers are advised to lodge a complaints against them under MRTPC (Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission) Act-1966. Most of the sellers are also selling Lightning Welk or Busicon Contarium i.e. a shell from Florida and Bahamas, which is readily available in India for Rs. 100/- to Rs. 2000/- per piece in much much higher prices. Complains of forgery can also be initiated against them. It is observed that many of the so-called dealers do not have the actual Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy pieces in hand. One can see pictures of the same Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy on different websites. Nobody knows, who has the actual piece available.

The word indicates a physical association with breath or blood and is also used to express the human desire for recognition. It is not a somatic feeling, as nausea and giddiness are. History In Homer's works, thumos was used to denote emotions, desire, or an internal urge. Thumos was a permanent possession of living man, to which his thinking and feeling belonged. When a Homeric hero is under emotional stress, he may externalize his thumos and converse with or scold it.Long, A. A. Psychological Ideas in Antiquity. In: Dictionary of the History of Ideas. 1973-74 [2003]. link. Plato's Phaedrus and his later work The Republic discuss thumos as one of the three constituent parts of the human psyche. In the Phaedrus, Plato depicts logos as a charioteer driving the two horses eros and thumos (erotic love and spiritedness are to be guided by logos). In the Republic (Book IV) soul becomes divided into (See Plato's tripartite theory of soul): * nous (\\"intellect\\", \\"reason\\"), which is or should be the controlling part which subjugates the appetites with the help of thumos. * thumos (\\"passion\\"), the emotional element in virtue of which we feel anger, fear, etc.; * epithumia (\\"appetite\\", \\"affection\\"), to which are ascribed bodily desires; However, the term \\"emotion\\" is relatively modern. It was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to passions, sentiments and affections.Dixon,T. 2003. From Passions to Emotions: The Creation of a Secular Psychological Category. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 39. link. Plato suggested we have three parts of our soul, which in some combination makes our destined vocation that makes us better in, this is a hidden basis for developing ideas that are innate ideas. Thumos may draw from this to strengthen man with our reasoning, this tripartite division is as follows: # Reason (thoughts, reflections, questioning) # Spiritedness (ego, glory, honor) and # Desires (natural e.g. food, drink, sex vs unnatural e.g. money, power). Democritus used \\"euthymia\\" (i.e. \\"good thumos\\") to refer to a condition in which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, superstition, or other passions. For Democritus euthymia was one of the root aspects the goal of human life.  Greek polytheism  Achilles‚Äô, in the Illiad, cares for his own honour, he keeps god and deities in his heart; \\"...the thunderous lord of Hera might grant you the winning of glory, you must not set your mind on fighting the Trojans, whose delight is in battle, without me. So you will diminish my honour.\\" = Thymos and democracy: megalothymia and isothymia= \\"Megalothymia\\" refers to the need to be recognized as superior to others, while \\"isothymia\\" is the need to be recognized as merely equal to others. Both terms are neoclassical compounds, coined by Francis Fukuyama. In his book The End of History and the Last Man, the author mentions \\"thymos\\" in relation to liberal democracy and recognition. He relates Socrates' ideas about Thymos and desire to how people want to be recognized within their government. Problems emerge when other people do not recognize another's Thymos, and therefore do not provide the justice that it requires. In order for people to exist in harmony, Fukuyama argues, isothymia rather than megalothymia must be used to satisfy the human need for recognition. Any system that creates political inequality is necessarily feeding the megalothymia of some members while denying it to others. Fukuyama explains how Thymos relates to history with the example of anti-communism in relation to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China. He states, \\"We cannot understand the totality of the revolutionary phenomenon unless we appreciate the working of thymotic anger and the demand for recognition that accompanied communism's economic crisis.\\"Fukuyama, Francis.

The station airs a mixture of liberal and conservative talk, and is simulcast on WJNL 1210 in Kingsley, Michigan, WHAK 960 in Rogers City, Michigan, and FM stations WWMN 106.3 in Thompsonville, Michigan and WYPV 94.5 in Mackinaw City, Michigan, as well as a translator on 101.1 FM in Traverse City, Michigan. During the 1970s and 1980s, WJML was one of the most successful AM/FM radio combos in northern Michigan. The FM station has long since been sold off, but WJML/WJNL remains one of the most-popular talk stations in northern Michigan. Early history In somewhat of a rarity, WJML-FM 98.9 started first, on December 7, 1965, since in most situations, the AM station is usually the first to sign on. In the beginning, the station was an automated MOR format, with one live DJ, Bill Supernaw, in the morning (Supernaw is now the owner of the Cinema III movie theatre in Charlevoix). The station was owned by a Chicago broadcaster who named his station after his three children, John, Michael and Linda. It was one of northern Michigan's first-ever FM stations, and since many folks didn't have an FM radio at the time, an AM station, WJML/1110 was born on December 6, 1966. WJML was at the time the strongest AM station in northern Michigan during the daytime at 10 kW. However, the station was daytime only. Logo from 1981 bumper sticker The Music Station The 1970s saw several changes for WJML-FM/AM as the Harrington family sold the station, following the unexpected death of John Harrington, to a small group that owned WMUS-AM-FM Muskegon, Michigan; KQDS-AM-FM in Duluth Minnesota; and WPLY AM in Plymouth, Wisconsin. On February 14, 1977 WJML flipped from MOR to Top 40. Tim Achterhoff, an 11-year vet of WMUS at the time, plugged in the programming formula used successfully at the country station... but with a pop/rock playlist. The station was very music-intensive. News was moved to :54 past the hour, so JML was always in a music-sweep at the top of the hour. Great on-air talent included: Jay Alexander, Rob Hazelton, Ted Stevens, John Clark [Dennis Martin], Tim Nixon, Tom Tyler, Mike Daniels, Kurt Kelly, Art Morrison, Mark Kage, Nick Scott, Dave Walker, Cindy Smith and Sarah Wilson with news... and many more wonderful personalities. In a year and a half, the JML AMFM combo had more AQH audience than all other stations COMBINED in an 11-county area in a survey conducted by Arbitron. And the advertising revenue poured in... making it future target for plenty of move-ins! The station also adopted an easily remembered slogan: \\"The Music Station.\\" American Top 40 aired on this station starting in 1979. JML was the first highly structured station in northern Michigan, heavily formatted using liner cards, strict positioning statements, tight playlists, 'big city' sound with Lyle Dean (WLS) and Del Hull doing liners and \\"Time Bomb\\" legal ID's: \\"It's 12noon at The Music Station(sung or spoken)... WJML-FM/AM Petoskey.\\" From '77 until 1980 JML used jingles from Gwinsound of Dallas (Series 23), later switching to JAM Creative Production's Class Action (WLS) package. The station had influences from WBBM- Chicago in the news presentation with the standard liner between local news and ABC News: \\"Tempurature 50, that's 10 Celsius, JML NewsTime 11:56.\\" If WJML was to be remembered on a national level, it would be the fact that it was the first station ever to pair up Bob Kevoian and Tom Griswold for mornings, aka Bob and Tom. The two met at a Petoskey bar in the late 1970s and have been friends since. However, in 1983, Indianapolis radio station WFBQ lured them away, where they landed in syndication years later. The 1980s bring changes In 1983, due to increased competition from upstart rivals WKHQ and WKLT, WJML flipped to adult contemporary. Some of their DJs would answer the phone saying \\"WJML, The MUZAK Station!\\". This AC format featured spoken legal ID's and Tuesday Production's \\"Whisper\\" jingles. The jingles made the station sound as if it were embarrassed to say who it was. Several format alterations included a \\"Light Rock 99\\" phase. In 1989, the final nail was nailed as WJML was sold to Langer Gokey, the North Dakotan Dr Pepper bottler who also owned WKLT. Gokey's plan was to boost WKLT's power many folds over by moving its signal from 97.7 to 97.5 and have 100 kW WJML-FM, now WKLZ, simulcast WKLT's signal. Gokey, however, was not interested in AM radio at all, so he donated Kalkaska's WKLT 1420 to Kalkaska Schools (the station has since been silenced) and WJML was silenced and put up for sale. However, shortly after WJML was silenced, local broadcaster Rick Stone (originally started WAIR, was first GM/VP for WMKC) bought the station and flipped it to talk. The rebirthed station was an early success. Stone also upgraded the station's power to 10 watts overnight - barely enough power to cover Petoskey. In 1999, Petoskey lost its oldies station, WAIR 92.5 FM (now WFDX), when the station, owned by Langer Gokey, flipped unsuccessfully to country \\"The Bee\\". In response, WJML played oldies on the weekends and aired talk during the week, which would continue until its sister station WWKK signed on the following year. Into the 21st century In 2000, Stone decided to start a second AM in Petoskey giving WJML a sister. That station was WWKK \\"Kool 750\\", and at first, it was an oldies outlet. Kool 750 allowed WJML to segue back toward a talk format (though WJML still featured some oldies programming on weekends only for a short time before going back to all talk). Eventually, Petoskey got oldies again on the FM dial as Ross Biederman's WCCW-FM/107.5 Traverse City started simulcasting on WCZW/107.9 in nearby Charlevoix. This allowed WWKK to flip to talk as well, being a liberal talker while WJML became conservative talk. Recently, Stone traded WWKK in exchange for Roy Henderson's WLDR 1210 in Traverse City, MI, which allows WJML to have a stronger signal in the Cherry Capital. In preparation for the change, WJML asked listeners what shows they wanted to keep, since both WJML and WWKK could no longer co-exist. The former WWKK is now WARD 750, simulcasting the country format of WLDR-FM/101.9 in Traverse City. WJML today Today, WJML/WJNL airs mostly syndicated programs but does carry some weekly local shows including some sort of \\"Tradio\\" program where local businesses trade their products or services for a commercial radio schedule. Such trades are at an inflated trade rate. The stations' current lineup information is grossly outdated here with claims that said programming includes Citadel's Michael Patrick Shiels morning program, as well as Neal Boortz, Glenn Beck, Ed Schultz, Lou Dobbs and Michael Savage as well as libertarian talk show Free Talk Live,and Detroit Pistons basketball games. An attempt was made to clarify this information but even the their phone number is no longer in service. WJML has also moved into the newspaper business with its weekly publication of \\"TALK of the NORTH\\" Shopping and Entertainment Guide distributed free in Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Emmet, Grand Traverse, and Leelanau counties. On May 29, 2015, WJML's FM repeater in Charlevoix, W235CL on 94.9, signed on, providing 24/7 daytime coverage to the immediate Charlevoix area, with 250 watts of power. Effective August 8, 2016, W235CL moved to 101.1 FM in Traverse City, as W266CS. On January 31, 2017, WJML, WJNL and W266CS were sold to John Yob's Mitten News LLC for $700,000; the sale was consummated on May 23, 2017. As of May 13, 2018, WJML can now be heard on WWMN 106.3 in Thompsonville, WYPV 94.5 in Mackinaw City and WHAK 960 in Rogers City.

The Vasant Utsava (festival) on Panchami is celebrated forty days before Spring, because any season's transition period is 40 days, and after that, the season comes into full bloom. Nomenclature and date Vasant Panchami is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the bright half of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Magha, which typically falls in late January or February. Spring is known as the \\"King of all Seasons\\", so the festival commences forty days in advance. (It is generally winter-like in northern India, and more spring-like in central and western parts of India on Vasant Panchami, which gives credence to the fact that Spring is actually in full bloom 40 days after the Vasant Panchami day). The festival is particularly observed by Hindus in the Indian subcontinent, notably India and Nepal, it's also has been a historical tradition of Sikhs as well. In southern states, the same day is called Sri Panchami. On the island of Bali and the Hindus of Indonesia, it is known as \\"Hari Raya Saraswati\\" (great day of Saraswati). It also marks the beginning of the 210-day long Balinese Pawukon calendar. Hinduism Goddess Saraswati dressed in a yellow sari on Vasant Panchami, Kolkata.

It is celebrated by people in various ways depending on the region. Vasant Panchami also marks the start of preparation for holiday and Holi which occurs forty days later. For many Hindus, Vasant Panchami is the festival dedicated to goddess Saraswati who is their goddess of knowledge, language, music and all arts. She symbolizes creative energy and power in all its form, including longing and love (kama). The season and festival also celebrate the agricultural fields' ripening with yellow flowers of mustard crop, which Hindus associate with Saraswati's favorite color. People dress in yellow saris or shirts or accessories, share yellow-colored snacks and sweets. Some add saffron to their rice and then eat yellow cooked rice as a part of an elaborate feast. Many families mark this day by sitting with babies and young children, encouraging their children to write their first words with their fingers, and some study or create music together. The day before Vasant Panchami, Saraswati's temples are filled with food so that she can join the celebrants in the traditional feasting the following morning. In temples and educational institutions, statues of Saraswati are dressed in yellow and worshiped. Many educational institutions arrange special prayers or pujas in the morning to seek the blessing of the goddess. Poetic and musical gatherings are held in some communities in reverence for Saraswati. In Nepal, Bihar and eastern states of India such as West Bengal including north-eastern states like Tripura and Assam, people visit her temples and worship her (Saraswati Puja). Most of the schools arrange special Saraswati puja for their students on their premises. In Bangladesh, all major educational institutes and universities observe it with a holiday and a special puja. In the state of Odisha (30 Jan this year), the festival is celebrated as Basanta Panchami/Sri Panchami /Saraswati Puja. Homas and Yagnas are done in schools and colleges across the state. Students celebrate Saraswati Puja with great sincerity and fervor. Usually, toddlers start learning from this day in a unique ceremony named 'Khadi-Chuan'/Vidya- Arambha.https://templesinindiainfo.com/2022-vidyarambham-pooja-date-and-puja- timings/ In southern states such as Andhra Pradesh, the same day is called Sri Panchami where \\"Sri\\" refers to her as another aspect of the one goddess Devi.Festivals of India, Swami Mukundananda (2015). =Some Other Deities = Vasant Panchami, in some parts, celebrates the Hindu god of love Kama (left) with Rati, shown above at the Khajuraho temple. Another legend behind Vasant Panchami is based on the Hindu god of love called Kama. Pradyumna is Kamadev personified, as we learn from Krsna Book. Thus Vasant Panchami is also known as \\"Madana Panchami\\". Pradyumna is the son of Rukmini and Krsna. He awakens the passions of the earth (and its people) and thus the world blooms anew. It is remembered as the day when Parvati approached Kama to wake up Shiva in Yogic meditation since the Maha Shivaratri. The other gods support Parvati, and seek Kama's help to bring Shiva back from his meditation to do his duties in the world. Kama agrees and shoots arrows, made of flowers and bees, at Shiva from his heavenly bow of sugarcane in order to arouse him to pay attention to Parvati. This initiative is celebrated by Hindus as Vasant Panchami. Vasant Panchami is associated with the emotions of love and emotional anticipation in Kutch (Gujarat), and celebrated by preparing bouquet and garlands of flowers set with mango leaves, as a gift. People dress in saffron, pink or yellow and visit each other. Songs about Krishna's pranks with Radha, considered to mirror Kama-Rati, are sung.Dilipsinh, K. S.

Traditionally, in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, after bathing in the morning, people worship Shiva and Parvati. Offerings of mango flowers and the ears of wheat are traditionally made. =Deo temple: Sun God= The shrine of the Sun-God in Aurangabad district, Bihar known as the Deo-Sun Shrine, was established on Basant Panchami. The day is celebrated to commemorate the founding of the shrine by King Aila of Allahabad and the birthday of the Sun- Deo God. The statues are washed and old red clothes on them are replaced with new ones on Basant Panchami. Devotees sing, dance and play musical instruments. =Other= A kite flying at Basant Panchami event. At least since the 19th century, kite flying on Basant has been a popular event in north India well as in the region around Lahore, Pakistan. Kite flying is also traditional in west India on Uttarayan, in Mathura on Viskwakarma Puja and in south India. People celebrate the day by wearing yellow(white), eating sweet dishes and display yellow flowers in homes. In Rajasthan, it is customary for people to wear jasmine garlands.Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society, Volume 30 (1995) In Maharashtra, newly married couples visit a temple and offer prayers on the first Basant Panchami after the wedding. wearing yellow dresses. In the Punjab region, Sikhs and Hindus wear yellow turban or headdress. In Uttarakhand, in addition to Saraswati Puja, people worship Shiva, Parvati as the mother earth and the crops or agriculture. People eat yellow rice and wear yellow. It is also a significant school supplies shopping and related gift-giving season. In the Punjab region, Basant is celebrated as a seasonal festival by all faiths and is known as the Basant Festival of Kites. Children buy Dor (Thread) and Guddi or \\"Patang\\" (Kites) for the sport. The people of the Punjab wear yellow clothes and eat yellow rice to emulate the yellow mustard (sarson) flower fields, or play by flying kites.Basant Panchami 2017: All You Need To Know Of The Spring Festival And Saraswati Puja, NDTV ;(February 1 2017) According to Desai (2010), the tradition of flying kites on various festivals is also found in northern and western Indian states: Hindus in Rajasthan and especially in Gujarat associate kite flying with the period prior to Uttarayan; in Mathura (Uttar Pradesh), kites are flown on Dussehra; in Bengal kite flying takes place on Viskwakarma Puja in September. The sport is also found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and parts of south India. On Bali and among Indonesian Hindus, Hari Raya Saraswati (the festival's local name) is celebrated with prayers in family compounds, educational institutions, and public venues from morning to noon. Teachers and students wear brightly coloured clothes instead of their usual uniforms, and children bring traditional cakes and fruit to school for offerings in a temple. Sikhism Namdhari Sikhs have historically celebrated Basant Panchami to mark the beginning of spring. Other Sikhs treat it as a spring festival, and joyfully celebrate it by wearing yellow colored clothes, emulating the bright yellow mustard flowers in the fields. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire, encouraged the celebration of Basant Panchami as a social event in the Gurdwaras. In 1825 CE he gave 2,000 rupees to the Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara in Amritsar to distribute food. He held an annual Basant fair and sponsored kite flying as a regular feature of the fairs. Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his queen Moran would dress in yellow and fly kites on Basant Panchami. Maharaja Ranjit Singh would also hold a darbar or court in Lahore on Basant Pachami which lasted ten days when soldiers would dress in yellow and show their military prowess.Gulcharan Singh (1993), page 20, The Sikh Courier International, Volumes 33-37 In the Malwa region, the festival of Basant Panchami is celebrated with wearing of yellow dress and kite flying. In Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur, a Basant Panchami fair is held. People attend the fair awearing yellow clothes, turbans or accessories. Sikhs also remember the martyrdom of the child Haqiqat Rai on Basant Panchmi, who was arrested by the Muslim ruler Khan Zakariya Khan after being falsely accused of insulting Islam. Rai was given the choice of converting to Islam or death and, having refused conversion, was executed on the Basant Panchami of 1741 in Lahore, Pakistan.Pande, Alka (1999), Folk Music & Musical Instruments of Punjab: From Mustard Fields to Disco Lights, Volume 1, page 7, Pakistan Kite flying in Lahore goes back centuries. After creation of Pakistan it evolved into a highly competitive sport which is not limited to ‚Äúbasant‚Äù only. There are regional teams, competitions, and trophies. Kite And string making is an industry all over central Punjab providing livelihood to thousands. Given the shared history and culture in the Indian subcontinent, the Punjabi Muslims in and around Lahore also celebrate kite flying as a sport in Pakistan from home rooftops during the Basant season. Sufi Muslim Basant According to Lochan Singh Buxi, Basant Panchmi is a Hindu festival adopted by some Indian Muslim Sufis in the 12th century to mark the grave of the Muslim Sufi saint dargah of Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi and ever since, has been observed by the Chishti order. According to local Sufi traditions, the poet Amir Khusrau saw Hindu women carry yellow flowers to a temple on Basant and they were dressed in yellow, and he adopted this practice, one the Chishti order of Sufi Indian Muslims continue to practice. Controversy: Inter-religious disputes The Gujarat government has encouraged the observance of Saraswati Puja in schools on Vasant Panchami, a proposal that has been opposed by Indian Muslims because it is a religious festival of Hinduism.Mukul Kumar Mishra (24.01.2015) Gujarat: Circular to hold 'Saraswati Vandana' stirs controversy; Muslims express displeasure Vasant Panchami has been a historic occasion of dispute at the archaeological site of Bhojshala (Dhar, Madhya Pradesh) with evidence of an early Saraswati temple (locally called Waghdevi). On the site of Bhojshala is a later era Kamal-Maula mosque, which Muslims use for Friday prayers. The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has provided annual guidelines, when the Vasant Panchami festival falls on a Friday, announcing hours when Hindus can worship at Bhojshala on Vasant Panchami, and when Muslims can. However, in past years, the community scheduled earlier has refused to vacate the premises, leading to riots and disorder such as in the 1980s and 1990s.Indore celebrates Basant Panchmi, The Times of India, February 2 2017Bhojshala-Kamal Maula mosque row: What is the dispute over the temple-cum-mosque all about?, India Today, Shreya Biswas (February 12, 2016) See also * Vasanta (Ritu) References * \\"Vasant Panchmi\\", a book by Anurag Basu. * \\"Kite Festival\\" by Sanjeev Narula.

Fuller was widely regarded as the leader of the modern-day movement for affordable housing and had been honored for his work in the United States and abroad. Personal life Fuller was born in Lanett, Alabama, on January 3, 1935, to Render and Estin Cook Fuller. Render was employed by Lanett Bleachery and Dye Works and Estin was a homemaker. Estin died in 1938 at age 27 and Render was remarried in 1941 to Eunice Stephens. Render became self-employed with a small grocery store, ice cream shop and cattle farming. Fuller had two half-brothers by stepmother Eunice, Nick and Doyle. Nick died in 2006. Fuller majored in economics at Auburn University ('57) and received a law degree from the University of Alabama ('60). He married Linda Caldwell of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 1959. A successful businessman and lawyer, Fuller became a self-made millionaire by age 29.NP Times / NPT Executive of The Year - Millard Fuller In 1968, after giving up their wealth to refocus their lives on Christian service, Fuller and his wife, Linda, moved with their children to an interracial farming community in southwest Georgia. Koinonia Farm, founded by Clarence Jordan in 1942, became home to the Fuller family for five years until they moved to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) as missionaries in 1973 with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Upon returning to the United States, the Fullers began a Christian ministry at Koinonia Farm building simple, decent houses for low-income families in their community using volunteer labor and donations, and requiring repayment only of the cost of the materials used. No interest was charged, as it is with traditional mortgages, and no profit was made. These same principles guided the Fullers in expanding this ministry, called Partnership Housing, into a larger scale ministry known as Habitat for Humanity International. That vision was expanded in 2005 in the founding of a new non-profit housing organization, The Fuller Center for Housing. Fuller died unexpectedly on February 3, 2009, while en route to the hospital in nearby Albany, Georgia, aged 74. The housing movement =Koinonia Farm= In 1965, the Fuller family stopped to visit friends at Koinonia Farm on a road trip from NYC. After spending several hours with the intentional community's founder, Clarence Jordan, Millard and Linda decided to stay and began a relationship with Jordan that ultimately led to the creation of Habitat for Humanity. Jordan espoused an expression of Christianity which motivated him and the Fullers to seek ways to express God's love to their poorer neighbors. Koinonia Farm became Koinonia Partners in 1968 as the small community undertook several new projects, the primary focus of which was Partnership Housing. Believing that what the poor needed was capital, not charity,Fuller, Millard, Bokotola (New Jersey: New Century Publishers, 1977), 18 Jordan and Millard Fuller, along with other members of the Koinonia community, planned to develop a revolving \\"Fund for Humanity\\" which would take in donations that would be used to purchase building materials. Volunteer laborers would construct simple, decent houses along with the families who would eventually own the houses. The homeowners would then repay the cost of the materials to the Fund for Humanity at 0% interest. In this way, the work was not a give-away program and the funds repaid were then used to begin work on additional houses. =Zaire= Fuller moved his family to Zaire in 1973 to implement the ideals of Partnership Housing in the African context. Again, as missionaries of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Fullers began work in Mbandaka, a city of extreme poverty in the western part of the country. Among other projects, Fuller developed and oversaw what would be the first step in the international housing ministry. Undeveloped land in the center of Mbandaka was given by the government for the purpose of building a 100-house development. The units were constructed and sold to families using the Fund for Humanity and additional projects were planned before the Fullers returned to the United States in 1976. =Habitat for Humanity= The possibility of utilizing the Fund for Humanity to address housing needs in the United States on a broader scale began in San Antonio, Texas, in 1976. Concerned residents worked with Fuller to develop a program similar to that in Zaire, using volunteer labor to construct affordable, safe houses for needy families in San Antonio's slums. Soon the idea took hold in Appalachia, and by 1981, just five years from its inception, Habitat for Humanity had affiliates in fourteen states and seven foreign countries. In early 1984, Millard courted the man who would become Habitat's most famous volunteer, President Jimmy Carter. A native of Plains, Georgia, just a few miles from Habitat's headquarters in Americus, Georgia, Carter gave not only his name and reputation to the new non-profit, but his own resources as well. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter would make financial contributions regularly, but most significantly to Habitat, they would develop the Jimmy Carter Work Project, an annual week-long effort of building Habitat homes all over the world. The Carters participated all week at these events which came to attract thousands of volunteers each year. The Carters' involvement with Habitat for Humanity propelled the organization to even faster growth. By 2003, Habitat affiliates worldwide had built over 150,000 homes and were active in 92 nations.Youngs, Bettie The House That Love Built (Charlottesville: Hapton Roads Publishing Company) 295 Disputes between Fuller and the Habitat International board of directors regarding the direction of the organization came to a head in 2004. He and Linda were fired in March 2005 amid allegations of inappropriate behavior by him directed toward a female employee and conflicting opinions about future plans for Habitat's expansion.NP Times / Fuller Forced Out of Habitat For Humanity Sexual abuse allegations had been made by numerous women in the 1990s and 2000s. In the 1990s, Fuller was reprimanded by the Habitat Board of Directors after several women came forward. Those complaints were settled internally, but Fuller was warned. When a subsequent new allegation was made about an incident in 2003, Fuller was forced to resign. John Wieland, a Georgia developer who has built 26 houses for Habitat for Humanity and donated more than $500,000 to the organization, who was on the board in 1990-91, said this: \\"Our conclusion was that Millard was a hugger and was misinterpreted, and some people went out of their way to make something big out of something that wasn't really that big\\". Fuller continued his work in the housing movement with the establishment of the Fuller Center for Housing in April 2005. He expanded on the foundation of Habitat by encouraging communities to create \\"collaborative and innovative partnerships\\" to address the housing needs of the most needy in communities. He continued to travel extensively, speaking at Habitat affiliates and Fuller Center Covenant Partnerships to raise awareness, funds and volunteers in his effort to eradicate poverty housing from the face of the earth. Fuller had a simple burial and is buried on the grounds of Koinonia Farm. Recognition Fuller was the recipient of numerous awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. In September 1996, United States President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, and said, \\"Millard Fuller has done as much to make the dream of homeownership a reality in our country and throughout the world as any living person. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Millard Fuller has literally revolutionized the concept of philanthropy.\\" In 1999, Fuller received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In October 2005, the Fullers were honored by former President George H. W. Bush and the Points of Light Foundation with a bronze medallion embedded in The Extra Mile national monument in Washington, DC.Millard and Linda Fuller honoree medallion located on The Extra Mile memorial beginning at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street, NW and continues north on 15th Street to G Street, NW.

Most of the material they played was new, though they also included The Move's \\"California Man\\", interpolating the basic riff from another Move oldie, \\"Brontosaurus\\", and Wizzard's \\"Are You Ready to Rock\\". Several of the songs appeared on their only album Super Active Wizzo, released in September 1977 on the Warner Bros. record label. They also issued two singles, \\"The Stroll\\" (1977), and \\"Dancin' At The Rainbow‚Äôs End\\" (1978). None of the recordings charted. A UK tour was scheduled for spring 1978, but was cancelled as they disbanded at around the same time. Wizzo Band had proved an uncommercial venture; the records received unenthusiastic reviews from critics who were baffled by the music, especially in the light of Wood's earlier track record as a creator of hit records with his previous bands, and they were ignored by radio programmers. The live version of \\"California Man\\" was issued as the B-side of Wood's 1982 single \\"O.T.T.\\", under the title \\"Mystery Song\\". A similar arrangement was used by Cheap Trick in their own cover version of the song.

Structure From its origin under the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid the superior thyroid artery runs upward and forward for a short distance in the carotid triangle, where it is covered by the skin, platysma, and fascia; it then arches downward beneath the omohyoid, sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles. To its medial side are the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Branches It distributes twigs to the adjacent muscles, and numerous branches to the thyroid gland, connecting with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. The branches to the gland are generally two in number. One, the larger, supplies principally the anterior surface; on the isthmus of the gland it connects with the corresponding artery of the opposite side. A second branch descends on the posterior surface of the gland and anastomoses with the inferior thyroid artery. Besides the arteries distributed to the muscles and to the thyroid gland, the branches of the superior thyroid are: *The infrahyoid branch (or hyoid artery): a small artery that runs along the lower border of the hyoid bone beneath the thyrohyoid muscle. This artery connects with the infrahyoid branch of the opposite side. The infrahyoid branch is a derivative of the second aortic arch. *The sternocleidomastoid branch runs downward and laterally across the sheath of the common carotid artery, and supplies the sternocleidomastoideus muscle and neighboring muscles and skin; it frequently arises as a separate branch from the external carotid artery. * The superior laryngeal artery accompanies the internal laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, beneath the thyrohyoid muscle. This artery branches from the superior thyroid artery near its bifurcation from the external carotid artery. Together with the internal laryngeal nerve, it pierces the lateral thyrohyoid membrane, and supplies blood to the muscles, mucous membrane, and glands of the larynx, connecting with the branch from the opposite side. *The cricothyroid artery may contribute to the supply of the larynx. It follows a variable course either superficial or deep to the sternothyroid muscle. If superficial, it may be accompanied by branches of the ansa cervicalis, and if deep, it may be related to the external laryngeal nerve. It can connect with the artery of the opposite side and with the laryngeal arteries. Clinical significance This artery must be ligated at the thyroid when conducting a thyroidectomy. If the artery is severed, but not ligated, it will bleed profusely. In order to gain control of the bleeding, the surgeon may need to extend the original incision laterally to ligate the artery at its origin at the external carotid artery. Furthermore, the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve courses in close proximity to the superior thyroid artery, making it at risk for injury during surgery.

Jones began programming on Apple computers in high school, assembling a multiplayer game called Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. While attending the University of Chicago, Jones met Seropian and the two formed a partnership to publish Minotaur. Following the modest success of Minotaur, Jones programmed Bungie's next game, Pathways Into Darkness, and worked on code, level design and story development for Bungie's Marathon and Myth series. For Bungie's next projects, Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, Jones took on a more managerial role as project lead. He served as director on the 2014 video game Destiny. Early life Jones became interested in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, \\"and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac,\\" he said. \\"The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games.\\" Career Jones met Alex Seropian in his second year at the University of Chicago. In 1991 Seropian had founded Bungie and published his own game, Operation Desert Storm. Seropian was looking for another game to publish, and they decided to work together to finish Minotaur. While Seropian did design and marketing, Jones finished the programming. Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete shipped in April 1992; while the game sold only around 2,500 copies (it required a then-rare modem for network play), it developed a devoted following. After publishing Minotaur, Jones and Seropian formed a partnership; \\"What I liked about him was that he never wasted any money\\", Jones said of his partner. Bungie focused on the Mac platform due to familiarity with the platform and ease of use. \\"The PC market was really cutthroat, but the Mac market was all friendly and lame. So it was easier to compete,\\" Jones said. After Minotaur, Bungie began work on a 3D graphics version of the game, but realized that the game's format was not suited to a 3D environment. Instead, Jones and Seropian wrote a brand-new story for what became Pathways Into Darkness. Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time, he single-handedly coded the game on a Mac IIfx, passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent. Pathways was successful enough that Bungie moved from a one-bedroom apartment to an actual office. Bungie's next project started as an update of Pathways but evolved into a science fiction shooter game, Marathon. The game included state-of-the-art graphics, network multiplayer, and voice support, and won a number of awards on release in 1994. Jones recalled that he was surprised anyone ever completed the game and sought to atone for some of its shortcomings with its sequel, Marathon 2: Durandal, which was also released for Windows PCs. The Marathon series was followed by a series of real-time strategy games, starting with Myth: The Fallen Lords in 1996. Bungie continued to expand, and in 1997 work began on a new project, codenamed Blam! (Jones had changed the name from Monkey Nuts because he could not bring himself to tell his mother about the new game under that title.) Blam! evolved from a real-time strategy game to a third-person shooter to a first-person shooter called Halo: Combat Evolved. Jones role in development was unlike Marathon and Myth, where Jones was involved in developing more than half the levels and much to most of the story. Instead, he was the project lead and a manager, barely providing any code to the game. He would read war journals by authors such as John Kinkaid and Winston Churchill. In 2000, Microsoft acquired Bungie, moving the team from Chicago to Washington State. Jones recalled that the buyout was a \\"blur [...] We'd been talking to people for years and years‚Äîbefore we even published Marathon, Activision made a serious offer [to buy us]. But the chance to work on [the Microsoft Xbox console]‚Äîthe chance to work with a company that took the games seriously. Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue.\\" Around the same time, a glitch in versions of Myth II was found to entirely erase a player's hard drive; this led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped, costing Bungie nearly one million dollars. Composer Martin O'Donnell said that this recall created financial uncertainty in the studio, though accepting the offer was not something \\"Bungie had to do.\\" Jones and Seropian refused to accept Microsoft's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout. Combat Evolved was highly successful, selling more than a million units in its first six months and driving Xbox sales. Jones led the development team that created its sequel, Halo 2, and served as director on a new video game series, Destiny. He was listed in Next Generation Magazines top 100 Developers in 2006 and 2007. After the release of Halo 2, Jones took a sabbatical from Bungie, not knowing whether he wanted to continue making games. As Jones returned, his involvement with Halo began to diminish, as Jones tended to 'dislike' sequels. He desired to build a new intellectual property. Jones worked closely with colleague Jaimie Griesemer who was working on his own internal project named \\"Dragon's Tavern\\" which Griesemer described to be a \\"third person fantasy game\\" In the end however, Jones had the most power at Bungie, despite not being the President he was the majority share-holder and his vision of the studio was his alone to decide. In the end, Jason got his way with the studio's next project and worked with Griesemer to combine his ideas of \\"Dragon's Tavern\\" with what would be Destiny. As development continued, and with Griesemer gone, the writing team led by Joseph Staten had created a \\"Super-Cut\\" which was essentially a summary of the game's story-line. The super-cut was poorly received by Jones and the rest of the studio. Shortly after, Jones decided to scrap the writing team's work and effectively re-write the story very late into production with Marty O'Donnell, believing it was not feasible and almost impossible to complete. Knowing the game was in peril with his proposed reboot of the story, Jones formed a group called the \\"Iron Bar\\" composed of art director Christopher Barrett, designer Luke Smith and writer Eric Raab, an experienced book editor. Jones and the rest of Bungie carried on to release Destiny on September 9, 2014, to lukewarm reception. Jones is the Chief Creative Officer at Bungie, building new worlds with an investment from Chinese company NetEase.

He is currently a leading member of the Iraqi opposition. Although he was formerly a leading member of the Ba'ath Party, and was therefore very close to individuals such as Saddam Hussein who were subsequently accused of having committed a number of atrocities. Al-Ali is popular in Iraq, he resigned twice from high ranking governmental positions in protest.  Early years  Al-Ali was born in Salah ad Din Governorate, in a village near the city of Tikrit. His father, Omar, was a small landowner who was involved in agricultural production. Al-Ali eventually migrated to Baghdad where he attended law school and became active in politics. At the time, the two major political parties that were popular amongst Iraqi youth were the Iraqi Communist Party and the Ba'ath Party, both of which expounded leftist principles relating to the redistribution of wealth and the eradication of the old social classes that dominated Iraqi society at the time, and both of which were violently opposed to the British. In that context, Al-Ali joined the Ba'ath party. His activism generated a certain amount of hostility from the government.  Years in Government  By 1968, Al-Ali was a leading member of the Ba'ath Party. When the Ba'ath seized power in the July Revolution of 1968, Al-Ali was appointed to the Iraqi Revolution Command Council (the \\"RCC\\"), a group of six leading Baath party officials who held joint executive authority over the entire country. Each member of the RCC also held governmental posts; Al-Ali was appointed Minister of Culture and Information. As such, Al-Ali was responsible for cultural affairs and for managing the government's official information campaign.  Exile in Lebanon  A number of differences emerged between Al-Ali and the rest of his ministerial colleagues, in 1970, Al-Ali resigned from his governmental positions as a result of these differences, and was sent into exile to Egypt. Al-Ali remained in Egypt for some time and eventually moved to Lebanon, where he remained until 1973.  Years in diplomacy  In 1972 and 1973, two major events greatly affected Iraq's geopolitical position. Firstly, in 1972, the Ba'athist government decided to put an end to British interests in Iraq's oil industry and nationalised all oil interests owned by British companies throughout the country. Secondly, the 1973 oil crisis caused the price of oil to quadruple in international markets overnight. The combination of these two events greatly reinforced the position of the Ba'ath, which was then able to invest vast amounts of capital into Iraq's economy and into its military. At that point the Iraqi government, confident of its position, invited a number of dissidents to return to Iraq. Al-Ali returned to Baghdad after he was promised safe passage. Shortly after his arrival he was offered the position of Ambassador to Sweden, which he initially refused but was soon appointed as Ambassador to Sweden, where he served from 1973 to 1976. He subsequently was Ambassador to Spain from 1976 to 1978, and was then appointed as Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, where he served from 1978 to 1981.  Years in opposition  Saddam Hussein assumed the presidency in 1979, and later that year attended the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cuba, which Al-Ali also attended and met with representatives from the new Islamic Republic of Iran. A few months after the Iran‚ÄìIraq War commenced, Al-Ali resigned his position once again. As a result of this decision, Al-Ali was banned from returning to his home country, and was only able to return to Iraq after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. After the 1991 Gulf War, Al-Ali decided to formally join the Iraqi opposition, and with Iyad Allawi formed the short-lived Al-Wifaq party. He began publishing a weekly political newspaper from London that adopted an anti-Saddam and staunchly patriotic line. The paper rejected any foreign influence in the country and was fiercely opposed to the international sanctions that had been imposed against Iraq by the international community.  Return to Iraq  As the war commenced in March 2003, Al-Ali was interviewed on a number of occasions on Al-Jazeera in which he condemned both the US-led invasion and Saddam Hussein's government. As the Iraqi government began to fall, Al-Ali entered the country through the Syrian-Iraqi border and this event was captured on an Al-Arabiya documentary that was aired shortly after the war. Al-Ali lived in Baghdad from 2003 to 2006, where he published his weekly newspaper, which adopted an anti-occupation and opposition stance. He now lives in retirement.

The club folded in 1994 after becoming insolvent. Wacker played at the highest level in Berlin for many years throughout its history, in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg, the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg from 1933 onwards and, finally, the Oberliga Berlin. After the Introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963 Wacker dropped to the second tier Regionalliga Berlin. From 1971 to 1974 the club unsuccessfully took part in the promotion round to the Bundesliga on four occasions. The club became a founding member of the 2. Bundesliga in 1974 but dropped out of the league and professional football in 1979. Wacker also had taken part in the DFB-Pokal, the German Cup, on a number of occasions, advancing to the second round in 1937, 1976‚Äì77, 1977‚Äì78 and 1979‚Äì80. History Wacker was founded 25 July 1904 as Reinickendorfer FC West and in 1908 merged with Tegeler FC Hohenzollern 1905 to form SC Wacker 04 Tegel. The club played in the top- flight Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg through the 1920s, remaining a solid mid- table side throughout the years, never claiming a title of their own, but also never being relegated. Wacker remained in the top-flight, joining the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933, but were immediately relegated. They returned after a single season absence, were sent down for the 1939‚Äì40 season, and after again being promoted in 1940, played in the first division until the end of the war. Through the 1930s Wacker made a number of cup appearances. They were beaten 6‚Äì0 by Tennis Borussia Berlin in the final of the Berliner Landespokal in 1931 and made three appearances in the Tschammerspokal, predecessor to today's DFB- Pokal. After the end of the war in 1945, Wacker resumed first division play in the Oberliga Berlin, initially as SG Reickendorf-West, but were sent down after a last place finish in 1956. They returned to the Oberliga a season later and stayed in first division football until the 1963 formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional league. Wacker went on to play second tier football in the Regionalliga Berlin and the 2. Bundesliga Nord where they did quite well on the field despite limited resources. Through the early 1970s the club earned three second and one first place Regionalliga finishes. The club's experience in the 2. Bundesliga in the middle of the decade was more difficult, finally leading to their relegation to the Amateurliga Berlin (III) in 1977. After one more season in the 2. Bundesliga Nord, Wacker slipped to third and fourth division play where they toiled for a decade and a half before finally going bankrupt in 1994, playing in the tier four Verbandsliga Berlin at the time.Historic German football league tables Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv, accessed: 1 December 2015Wacker 04: Die Festung am Wackerweg Der Tagesspiegel, published: 15 July 2012, accessed: 1 December 2015 Some of its members went on to join BFC Alemannia 90, resulting in the club playing as BFC Alemannia 90 Wacker, a name that was never official and was reverted by the club in 2013.Alemannia-Wacker hat es nie gegeben Fussball-Woche.de, published: 18 March 2013, accessed: 28 November 2015  Honours  The club's honours: * Regionalliga Berlin (II) ** Champions: 1972 ** Runners-up: 1971, 1972, 1972 * Amateur-Oberliga Berlin (III) ** Champions: 1978 * Berliner Landespokal ** Winners: 1950, 1968, 1972 ** Runners-up: 1931, 1952, 1959, 1963, 1965, 1971, 1980 See also *Berlin derby References  External links  * The Abseits Guide to German Soccer * Wacker 04 Berlin at worldfootball.net * Wacker 04 Berlin at Fussballdaten.de Defunct football clubs in Germany Wacker Association football clubs established in 1904 1904 establishments in Germany Association football clubs disestablished in 1994 1994 disestablishments in Germany Football clubs in Germany ","title":"Wacker 04 Berlin"},{"id":"4297759","text":"Adye is both a surname and a given name.

He co-founded the group with Mohammad Seifzadeh and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Shirin Ebadi. Along with Ebadi, Soltani served as a lawyer for the family of slain Iranian- Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi, who was allegedly tortured and murdered in Evin Prison in July 2003. Ebadi and Soltani, along with others, also represented jailed journalist Akbar Ganji during his imprisonment and long hunger strike.  Life  Soltani was incarcerated for political offences in 2005 and 2009. He received an 18-year prison sentence in 2012 and was banned for an additional 20 years from practicing law. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience and called him \\"one of the bravest human rights defenders in Iran\\".  Legal work  Soltani is a co-founder of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an Iranian human rights organization, along with Mohammad Seifzadeh and future Nobel Peace Prize-winner Shirin Ebadi. Along with Ebadi and Seifzadeh, Soltani served as a lawyer for the family of slain Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi, who was allegedly tortured and murdered in Evin Prison in July 2003. Soltani, along with Seifzadeh, Ebadi and others, also represented jailed journalist Akbar Ganji during his imprisonment and long hunger strike and imprisoned Iranian- American academic Haleh Esfandiari.  2005 imprisonment  On 25 July 2005, Soltani criticized the fairness of the trial brought by Kazemi's family. Two days later, a Tehran prosecutor issued a warrant to search Soltani's home and office. The prosecutor then charged him with espionage. On 30 July, while participating in a sit-in to protest the charge, Soltani was arrested. He was detained incommunicado at Evin prison, including two months in Section 209, which is reserved for political prisoners. On 6 March 2006, he was released on bail of 100,000 euros. On 16 July 2006, he was informed that the Revolutionary Court had sentenced him to five years' imprisonment and the loss of his civic rights for \\"non-respect of the confidentiality of the preliminary enquiry\\" in the Kazemi case. He appealed the decision and was acquitted on 28 May 2007 of all charges pending against him since July 2005. However, his identity papers were confiscated, preventing him from traveling.  2009 imprisonment  On June 16, four days after the 2009 June election, Abdolfattah Soltani was arrested, his computers seized, and he was again taken to Evin prison. There was no arrest warrant, and no reasons for the arrest were stated. He was held there for 72 days, 17 of which were in solitary confinement and was not allowed to shower for the first 15 days. He lost 15 pounds while in prison. According to Soltani, he was approached by a judge named Majid Matin Rasekh about a day after he was locked up and accused of \\"being skeptical about the results of the election.‚Äú The judge then issued an order to detain him on \\"a temporary basis\\".

As he was married at the time to Tessa Jowell, the then United Kingdom Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, some newspapers termed the accusations Jowellgate.  History  Tessa Jowell married international corporate lawyer David Mills in 1979. In the early 1990s, Mills acted for Silvio Berlusconi, then a high-profile businessman and former Prime Minister of Italy. During his work for Berlusconi, Mills received $600,000 (¬£340,000);\\"Focus: The minister and the ¬£350,000 gift\\" , Times, 26 February 2006 the precise source of the money and the reason for its payment was under dispute, with Mills saying that the money was part of a larger amount paid indirectly to him by another Italian client, Diego Attanasio, although Attanasio has denied this claim when found in London on 2 March (between custodial sentences for bribery and corruption).\\"Alleged source of cash found in London\\", Guardian, 2 March 2006 Mills was investigated in Italy for money laundering and alleged tax fraud and on 10 March 2006 Italian prosecuting magistrates decided that they had sufficient evidence to ask a judge to indict Berlusconi and Mills. The judgement was appealed by David Mills. On 27 October 2009, the Italian Appeal Court upheld his conviction and his sentence of 4¬Ω years prison. He confirmed that he would initiate a second and final appeal to the Cassation Court. On 25 February 2010, the Italian Cassation Court (the second and last court of appeal under Italian law) ruled a sentence of not guilty because the statute of limitations had expired. Procedural changes Sir Alistair Graham, Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (2003-7), said the controversy over Jowell highlighted the problem that public trust was being undermined by the way alleged misconduct by ministers was policed.

Family Jane Howard, born between 1533 and 1537,Peter Henry Emerson in his The English Emersons; A Genealogical Historical Sketch quotes Francis Bloomfield and Charles Parkin from The History and Antiquities of the County of Norfolk was the daughter of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and Frances de Vere. Her grandparents on her father's side were Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Elizabeth Stafford. Her maternal grandparents were John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, and Elizabeth Trussell. Jane Howard had two brothers, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, and two sisters, Katherine Howard, who married Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley, and Margaret Howard, who married Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. Jane Howard's youngest sister, Margaret, was born after their father's execution.. Life Jane Howard's father, the Earl of Surrey, was tried and convicted of treason at the Guildhall on 13 January 1547, and beheaded on Tower Hill on 19 January 1547. In 1548 his children were placed in the care of their aunt, Mary FitzRoy, who appointed the martyrologist, John Foxe, as their tutor.; . About 1563/4 Jane Howard married Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, who had succeeded to the earldom after his father's death on 10 February 1564.. In November 1569 Westmorland joined the Earl of Northumberland in the Northern Rebellion. After initial successes, Westmorland and Northumberland were forced to flee to the Scottish border when Queen Elizabeth sent forces north under the Earl of Sussex. Sussex proclaimed Westmorland and Northumberland rebels at York on 19 November. Shortly thereafter Northumberland was handed over to the Scottish Regent, the Earl of Moray. However Westmorland was given refuge by Lord Kerr at Ferniehirst Castle in Roxburghshire, and eventually escaped by sea in 1570 to the Spanish Netherlands, where he remained an exile until his death. In 1571 he was attainted, and all his honours forfeited. After her husband's attainder, the Queen granted Jane a pension of ¬£200 for life.. In the events which preceded the Northern Rebellion in 1569, the Countess had more to do with raising the troops than her husband did. She was well educated but perhaps not the cleverest of women when it came to understanding political machinations. She was first to urge the rebels to rise up against Elizabeth I of England, and yet she expected Elizabeth to pardon her when they failed. The Countess hoped to arrange the marriage of her brother, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, to Mary, Queen of Scots, and put them both on England's throne. He was executed for treason in 1572 and she lived under house arrest for the rest of her life. The Countess was buried 30 June 1593 at Kenninghall, Norfolk.. Westmorland continued to be involved for many years in plots to invade England and replace Queen Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1599 he considered marrying again. His prospective bride was the daughter of President Richardot. Westmorland died 16 November 1601 at Nieuwpoort, Flanders. On 25 June 1604 two of his daughters, Katherine and Anne, were granted pensions of 200 marks a year by King James.

The district comprises of fertile land, contrasting with the more typical poor soil and scrub pinelands surrounding it. Description The district is located 1.5 miles (2 km) north of Interstate 64 from exit No. 136, \\"Zion Crossroads.\\" The district is roughly bounded by U.S. Route 15 and Virginia Routes 22 and 613. The area is named for a natural spring noted by Thomas Jefferson as possessing \\"some medicinal virtue.\\" The district features a mixture of wooded and farmed lands. Its distinguishing geological feature is the presence of a heavy clay soil that retains plant nutrients and moisture, creating an open landscape suitable for farming. The area is noted for its park-like views, particularly from U.S. Route 15. Preservation The district was preserved following attempts by the state of Virginia to build a prison there, and after a strip mine was proposed in the area to mine clay for cat litter. The strip mine happened anyway (Google Earth maps of the area clearly show the destruction caused by the mine) but not on the scale that was intended originally and a great many significant houses and lands continue to be preserved and excluded from the development that is transforming some of the area around the district.

Halite began as a solo project for Graham, who debuted with the critically acclaimed first album \\"Head On\\" with Warner Bros. Records in 2003. Head On was an off-kilter melodic pop/rock album. He played most instruments on the record but needed musicians to help out for playing live. He asked his friends Binzer Brennan, Keith Farrell and Derren Dempsey if they would tour with him. Halite then grew into a fully formed band. They soon went on to record and independently release their second album \\"Courses\\" in 2004. Halite played numerous shows over the following two years, including opening the Slane Concert in 2003 for Red Hot Chili Peppers and Foo Fighters. In early 2005, due to commitments with others projects from each member, the band was put on hold.  Boss Volenti  Hopkins was a member of Dublin band Boss Volenti for three years. He drummed on their self-titled debut album released in 2006 but left the band immediately after their appearance at Electric Picnic 2008.  The Cake Sale  Hopkins appeared as part of the band on the 2006 Oxfam charity album, The Cake Sale.  Snow Patrol  Hopkins spent the early part of 2007 stepping in as drummer for Snow Patrol on their European, Australian, New Zealand and American tours.  Dolores O'Riordan  He drummed on Dolores O'Riordan's debut solo album, Are You Listening? in 2007 before embarking on a worldwide tour with her.  Once and The Swell season  Hopkins also played on the soundtrack to the Irish Oscar-winning musical film Once which was written and directed by John Carney. He drummed on a few of the songs with Glen Hansard of The Frames and Mark√©ta Irglov√°. Hopkins toured with The Swell Season, which features Glen Hansard, Mark√©ta Irglov√° and members of The Frames. The Swell Season released their second album, Strict Joy, in September 2009.  Others  Hopkins has played drums on numerous albums, both Irish and internationally, including with The Frames, The Swell Season, David Kitt, Mundy, The Reindeer Section, Josh Ritter, Jape, The Pale and Pugwash amongst many others. Hopkins plays Zildjian cymbals, Aquarian drumheads, uses Vic Firth sticks and Drum Workshop drums, drum hardware and pedals.

Babeland has an online store and four retail stores (in Seattle, Brooklyn, and two in Manhattan). History Claire Cavanah and Rachel Venning founded Toys in Babeland in 1993, in response to the lack of women-friendly sex shops in Seattle. The store's name is a spoonerism of Babes in Toyland, a feminist riot grrrl punk band and Babes in Toyland, the title of a 1934 Laurel & Hardy film. Committed to offering information and encouragement to women who wanted to explore their sexuality, the owners focused on selling quality sex toys in a boutique-like setting. In 1995, Toys in Babeland started its mail order business with a small print catalog based out of their Seattle store. Shortly thereafter, in 1996, the Toys in Babeland website followed. In 1998, the owners opened their second Toys in Babeland store in New York City, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In 2003, they opened another New York store, in SoHo. In 2005, Babeland debuted its fourth store in Los Angeles, which has since closed. In 2008, Babeland opened a new location in Park Slope, Brooklyn, making a total of three stores in New York City. In 1999, the Toys in Babeland staff developed a specific mission: to promote and celebrate sexual vitality by providing an honest, open and fun environment. Encouraging personal empowerment, community education, and support for a more passionate world are key. In 2003, Venning and Cavanah published Sex Toys 101: The Ultimate Guide to Choosing and Using Sex Toys. It teaches readers the ins and outs of sexual anatomy, vibrators, strap-ons, lube, men's toys, anal play, and more. The photograph-illustrated book, written in an informal style, is the first full- color guide to toys for satisfying sex. In 2005, Toys in Babeland officially shortened its name to \\"Babeland\\" and modernized its look. Says co-founder Venning, \\"Toys in Babeland had become much more than just a place to buy sex toys, so we decided to present Babeland as a destination, a lifestyle, a state of mind‚Äîall celebrating the simple truth that sexually healthy people make the world a happier place.\\" In 2008, Babeland ran a promotion in which they gave away a free sex toy to anyone who voted in that November's election. In January 2010, Venning and Cavanah, in association with Jessica Vitkus, published a second book: Moregasm: Babeland's Guide to Mind-Blowing Sex Babeland was purchased by rival sex shop Good Vibrations in August 2017. Babeland continues to operate as a separate brand. Notable employees Queer erotica author Dena Hankins worked at Babeland as Web Operations Manager from 1998‚Äì2006. Awards Babeland has received numerous awards over the years, including a 2006 Zagat's Survey award as \\"the best shopping experience in New York.\\" It was voted \\"Best Place to Buy Sex Toys\\" by The Village Voice and Seattle Weekly.

The trees within the forest consist overwhelmingly of hardwoods of the former Eastern Woodlands ecosystem. Portions of Beall Woods State Park have been designated a National Natural Landmark as the Forest of the Wabash. The state park was created in 1966. The nearest towns with any sizable commercial infrastructure, including hotels and grocery stores, are Grayville and Mount Carmel. The park does host a small primitive campground and maintains a visitor center which opened in April 2001. The park maintains of hiking trails, primarily through the Forest of the Wabash portion of the park. Forest of the Wabash The Forest of the Wabash Natural Area within Beall Woods State Park contains trees from 64 separate species. Foresters have counted more than 300 climax trees with trunks of greater than diameter at breast i.e. high. Some of the trees in the Forest of the Wabash are more than tall. Trees of note include the white oak (the state tree of Illinois), the tuliptree (the state tree of Indiana, across the Wabash River), the American sycamore, and the American Sweetgum. One of the sweetgums of this Forest is designated as the \\"state champion\\" tree as being the largest member of this species known to grow within the boundaries of Illinois. The Forest of the Wabash was patented by the federal government to the Beall family in the early 19th century, and was owned by them as an undisturbed woodlot until the 1960s. Meanwhile, almost all of the other old-growth trees in the Wabash Valley were cut down to harvest fine hardwoods, cut timber, or even for firewood. Upon the death of Laura Beall, the last private-sector guardian of the Forest of the Wabash, and after a fight with a lumber company, in 1965 the State of Illinois condemned the Beall farm and forest for public use.

Early life Platt has one older brother and two younger sisters. He is eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland due to his Irish descent from his grandfather, Timothy Bryan. He was discovered by a Liverpool scout whilst playing for Fulwood and Cadley boys football club. Career He played for Preston Schoolboys aged 14‚Äì15, one of the most successful schoolboy teams Preston ever had. Aged 16 he went on to play for Lancashire Schools, Northwest Counties Schools and was finally selected for the English Schools squad (teams are selected on where you go school not on nationality). He was also an Irish Youth international. After finishing his high school studies at Our Lady's High School he continued his studies on a scholarship at Liverpool Football Academy. After regular appearances with both the youth team and Liverpool reserves although he was released by Liverpool at the end of the 2005 season, after failing to make the grade. He joined Bournemouth in May 2006 and made his debut after coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Southend United in the League Cup. He joined Morecambe on loan, initially for a period of one month, in November 2006. Limited to a few appearances at Morecambe, Platt picked up an injury in a match against Southport, and returned to Bournemouth when his loan ended in January 2007, before being loaned again to Weymouth. He was released by Bournemouth in May 2007 and joined Weymouth permanently. Platt joined Rushden & Diamonds on loan in February 2008 where he made a total of 10 appearances. On 20 May 2008 it was announced that Platt had joined Forest Green Rovers. He impressed in his first season with Forest Green and earned himself a one-year contract for the 2009‚Äì10 season. Platt joined Cambridge United in June 2010 after featuring in 80 league games for Forest Green, whilst scoring 10 goals in a two-season spell. A compensation fee was agreed by both clubs for the transfer. Platt begun the season well, although an early injury hindered him and he never really regained full form for the rest of the 2010‚Äì11 campaign. Platt joined fellow Conference National side AFC Telford United on loan in September 2011 for a month. He returned to Cambridge United in October 2011. Platt was then sent out on loan again to Lincoln City and when he returned to Cambridge in January 2012 he had his contract terminated and subsequently signed an 18-month permanent contract at Sincil Bank with Lincoln. On 21 February 2012 he suffered a broken tibia following a 50/50 challenge with James Chambers in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Doncaster Rovers. The injury would keep him out of action for almost a year, with Platt describing the recovery as a mental process as well as a physical one. He returned to action as a late substitute for Nicky Nicolau is Lincoln City's 4-2 Football Conference defeat at Southport on 8 January 2013 but this would prove to be his last action for the club as he left the club by mutual consent on 7 March 2013 with the club's new manager Gary Simpson reasoning that the club's relegation battle meant that Platt was unable to be given the games needed to regain full fitness. Platt immediately joined Gainsborough Trinity on a free transfer, making nine Football Conference North appearances for the club without scoring, before leaving the club at the end of the season having returned to the North-West to live. In July 2013 he joined Stalybridge Celtic, linking up with his former boss at Forest Green, Jim Harvey.

Here they discovered the phenomenon of salt ‚Äúcrystallization‚Äù and used it as a metaphor for human relationships. \\"In the salt mines, nearing the end of the winter season, the miners will throw a leafless wintry bough into one of the abandoned workings. Two or three months later, through the effects of the waters saturated with salt which soak the bough and then let it dry as they recede, the miners find it covered with a shining deposit of crystals. The tiniest twigs no bigger than a tom-tit‚Äôs claw are encrusted with an infinity of little crystals scintillating and dazzling. The original little bough is no longer recognizable; it has become a child‚Äôs plaything very pretty to see. When the sun is shining and the air is perfectly dry the miners of Hallein seize the opportunity of offering these diamond-studded boughs to travellers preparing to go down to the mine.\\" Story behind term Along one particular trip into the 500-ft deep Salzburg mines, Stendhal and Madame Gherardi were introduced to an intelligent Bavarian officer who thereafter joined their company. Soon enough, the officer began to become quite taken by Madame Gherardi. The officer, according to Stendhal, could be seen to be visually \\"falling in love\\" with her. What struck Stendhal the most, as an undertone of madness grew moment by moment in the discourse of the officer, was how the officer saw perfections in this woman which were more or less invisible to Stendhal‚Äôs eyes. For example, he began to praise Madame Gherardi‚Äôs hand, which had been curiously marked by smallpox in her childhood and had remained very pocked and rather brown. Stendhal reasoned, \\"How shall I explain what I see?\\" He wondered, \\"Where shall I find a comparison to illustrate my thought?\\" Just at that moment Madame Gherardi was toying with a pretty branch covered with salt crystals which the miners had given her. The sun was shining (it was the third of August) and the little salt prisms glittered like the finest diamonds in a brightly lit ballroom. From this observation Stendhal formulated his concept of mental \\"crystallization\\" and thus set forth to explain it to Madame Gherardi, who was curiously unaware of the officer's enhanced infatuation for her. He told her, \\"The effect produced on this young man by the nobility of your Italian features and those eyes of which he has never seen the like is precisely similar to the effect of crystallization upon that little branch of hornbeam you hold in your hand and which you think so pretty. Stripped of its leaves by the winter it was certainly anything but dazzling until the crystallization of the salt covered its black twigs with such a multitude of shining diamonds that only here and there can one still see the twigs as they really are.\\" That is, \\"This branch is a faithful representation of la Ghita (Madame Gherardi) as viewed by the imagination of this young officer.\\" Thus, according to Stendhal, the moment one begins to take interest in a person, one no longer sees him or her as they really are, but as it suits one to see them. According to this metaphor, one sees flattering illusions created by a nascent interest; illusions analogous to pretty diamonds hiding a leafless branch of hornbeam, perceived only by the eyes of the one falling in love. Process of crystallization Stendhal describes or compares the ‚Äúbirth of love‚Äù in a new relationship as being a process similar or analogous to a trip to Rome. In the analogy the city of Bologna represents indifference and Rome represents perfect love: \\"When we are in Bologna, we are entirely indifferent; we are not concerned to admire in any particular way the person with whom we shall perhaps one day be madly in love with; even less is our imagination inclined to overrate their worth.\\" In a word, in Bologna ‚Äúcrystallization‚Äù has not yet begun. When the journey begins, love departs. One leaves Bologna, climbs the Apennines, and takes the road to Rome. The departure, according to Stendhal, has nothing to do with one‚Äôs will; it is an instinctive moment. This transformative process actuates in terms of four steps along a journey: #Admiration ‚Äì one marvels at the qualities of the loved one. #Acknowledgement ‚Äì one acknowledges the pleasantness of having gained the loved one's interest. #Hope ‚Äì one envisions gaining the love of the loved one. #Delight ‚Äì one delights in overrating the beauty and merit of the person whose love one hopes to win. Stendhal's depiction of \\"crystallization\\" in the process of falling in love This journey or crystallization process, shown above, was detailed by Stendhal on the back of a playing card while speaking to Madame Gherardi, during his trip to the Salzburg salt mine.  Applications  Psychologist Dorothy Tennov describes the process as a transformation in which the loved one‚Äôs characteristics are crystallized via mental events and neurological reconfigurations such that attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention. She uses this basis for her description of a \\"limerent object\\", related to the concept of limerence.

In 1839 Gideon Mantell reported having noticed the fossil during a visit. Mantell soon came to the conclusion that the specimen represented the, until then unknown, lower jaw of his Iguanodon, probably that of a juvenile. On 8 February 1841 he presented it as such to the Royal Society.Mantell, G.A., 1841, \\"Memoir on a portion of the lower jaw of the Iguanodon, and on the remains of the Hyl√¶osaurus and other Saurians, discovered in the Strata of Tilgate Forest, in Sussex\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 131(2): 131-151 This interpretation was immediately challenged by Richard Owen, who felt that any proof of a connection was lacking. In 1848, after several real jaws of Iguanodon had been discovered, Mantell changed his position, concluding it was a related but different genus or subgenus, coining the name Regnosaurus Northamptoni. The generic name is derived from the Regni or Regnenses, a British tribe inhabiting Sussex. The specific name honours Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton, the president of the Royal Society, who was about to resign.Mantell, G.A., 1848, \\"On the structure of the jaws and teeth of the Iguanodon\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 138: 183-202 By present conventions, the type species is written as Regnosaurus northamptoni. Regnosaurus is known only from the holotype BMNH 2422, a right mandibular (lower jaw) fragment, consisting of a third of the dentary and a part of the splenial, found in the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation. The specimen is six inches long and shows fifteen tooth sockets. Also some replacement teeth are visible. Other bone fragments have sometimes been referred to Regnosaurus, such as a fossil pubis recovered on the Isle of Wight, but as these are of other parts of the body and a reasonably complete skeleton is lacking, the identity cannot be proven. The same is true for some dermal spikes reported by William Blows. Regnosaurus was probably a rather small animal, about 4 metres (13 feet) long. Phylogeny First seen as some iguanodontid, Regnosaurus was later connected to armoured dinosaurs. In 1888 Richard Lydekker assigned it to the Scelidosauridae. In 1909 Friedrich von Huene classified it in the stegosaurian Omosauridae and in 1911 Alfred von Zittel assigned it to the Stegosauridae but these groups then had a different content and also included armoured forms. In 1956 Alfred Romer synonymised it with Hylaeosaurus. An entirely different suggestion was made by John Ostrom who surmised it might have been a sauropod. The first to state that it was a stegosaurian in the modern sense was George Olshevsky in 1993.Olshevsky, G., and Ford, T.L., 1993, \\"The origin and evolution of the stegosaurs\\", Gakken Mook, Dinosaur Frontline, 4: 65-103 This was confirmed by Paul Barrett and Paul Upchurch in 1995 who concluded that it is a stegosaur similar to Huayangosaurus, as the jaws are very similar. As the remains are so limited, many recent researchers have concluded Regnosaurus to be a nomen dubium.

Many specimens, mostly teeth, have been assigned to Revueltosaurus over the years. Currently, three species are included in this genus, all of which were originally thought to represent monospecific genera of basal ornithischian dinosaurs. It was 1 meter (3.3 feet) long. Species =Revueltosaurus callenderi= Teeth of Revueltosaurus callenderi collected in Petrified Forest National Park R. callenderi was named by Adrian P. Hunt in 1989 and it is the type species of the genus. The generic name honors its type locality, Revuelto Creek, Quay County of New Mexico. Revuelto is derived from Spanish revuelta, \\"revolution\\", in reference to the importance of the Late Triassic period for terrestrial vertebrate evolution. The specific name honours the director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History Jonathan F. Callender. R. callenderi was originally described as a basal ornithischian on the basis of 32 teeth: the holotype NMMNH P-4957 a nearly complete premaxillary (incisiform) tooth, the paratypes (NMMNH P-4958-9, a nearly complete maxillary or dentary tooth crown with root and a nearly complete premaxillary tooth crown) and 28 referred specimens. All specimens were collected from the type locality, from the Bull Canyon Formation, dating to the Norian stage. Later, other teeth were described by Padian (1990), Kaye and Padian (1994) and Hunt and Lucas (1994), from Chinle Formation of Arizona. Andrew B. Heckert (2002) redescribed the genus in detail and named a second species, R. hunti on the basis of teeth described by Hunt and Lucas (1994). He referred MNA V3690, an isolated tooth assigned by Kaye and Padian (1994) to R. callenderi from the Placerias/Downs quarry near St Johns, Arizona, to Tecovasaurus. Heckert listed the referred specimens CMNH PR1697-1699 originally described by Padian (1990) and the topotypes NMMNH P-4960, P-16573, P-33783-798. Four teeth were referred to aff. Revueltosaurus callenderi (NMMNH P-17362, P-17382 and P-17187). R. callenderi is known to date only from the Revueltian (early-mid Norian, the type locality dates back to the early Norian) of Bull Canyon Formation (Dockum Group, New Mexico) and the Painted Desert of the Petrified Forest Member (Chinle Formation, Arizona). Parker et al. (2005) described several partially complete skeletons of R. callenderi (PEFO 33787-95), including a nearly complete and a partial skulls, from the Revueltosaurus Quarry, Petrified Forest National Park. Other skeletons were discovered from the Painted Desert, including the nearly complete specimen PEFO 34561 which have been fully reconstructed recently. According to Sterling J. Nesbitt (2011), much of the Revueltosaurus cranial and postcranial material originates from a monotypic bonebed. Some specimens occur as isolated bones, while others are completely associated and even fully articulated. Thus, nearly the entire skeleton of R. callenderi is known and a full description of it is being prepared. =Revueltosaurus hunti= R. hunti was named by Andrew B. Heckert in 2002 as a basal ornithischian. The specific name honours the paleontologist Adrian P. Hunt for his contributions to the Triassic paleontology. It is known from the holotype NMMNH P-29357, a nearly complete tooth crown, the paratypes NMMNH P-29358-9 and topotypes P-29347-54 (and aff. R. hunti specimens NMMNH P-29355, P-29359) which were collected in the NMMNH locality 1171, Santa Fe County, New Mexico from the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation, Chinle Group, dating to the latest Carnian stage (Adamanian). Other isolated teeth (which Long and Murry (1995) assigned to R. callenderi) were collected two localities in the Blue Hills, east-central Arizona, from the Blue Mesa Member of the Chinle Formation, dating also to the latest Carnian. UCMP locality V92048 have yielded the topotypes UCMPV 173839-41, and the referred teeth UCMPV 139563-75 are from UCMP locality V7307. Parker et al. (2005) confirmed that R. hunti may be assignable to Revueltosaurus, on the basis of undescribed squamosal collected from its referred locality that is nearly identical to that seen in the Petrified Forest material of R. callenderi, thus suggesting that R. hunti is a pseudosuchian. In response to the report that R. callenderi was not an ornithischian, Heckert (2005) erected a new genus for R. hunti, Krzyzanowskisaurus. He suggested that the denticulated shelf on the teeth represented a cingulum. Irmis et al. (2007) and Nesbitt et al. (2007) synonymized Krzyzanowskisaurus with Revueltosaurus, and argued that this condition of the dentation is an autapomorphy of R. hunti and is not homologous to the ornithischian asymmetric swelling or a mammalian cingulum. =Revueltosaurus olseni= R. olseni was named by Hunt and Lucas in 1994 as a basal ornithischian, under the generic name Pekinosaurus. The generic name honors Pekin, North Carolina, where its type series was collected. The specific name honours the paleontologist Paul E. Olsen. Hunt and Lucas named the genus on the basis of the teeth series YPM 7666-9. Note that they designed the holotype to be YPM 8545, but the correct designation is YPM 7666 following Heckert et al. (2012). The type series of R. olseni was thought to originate from the Pekin Formation of Montgomery County. Heckert et al. (2012) noted that recent field work has shown that strata formerly assigned to that formation, including the type locality of R. olseni, actually pertain to the overlying Cumnock Formation (located in the Sanford Subbasin, Deep River Basin). Hence, the type locality and the newly discovered Moncure locality are from the same stratigraphic interval. The Cumnock Formation belongs to the Chathan Group (of the Newark Supergroup), which is recognized as Late Triassic in age. Most workers have assigned the Cumnock Formation a Carnian age. Most recent work, however, demonstrates that much of it is in fact Norian in age. Therefore, the strata exposed at the Moncure locality are probably early Norian in age. The Moncure locality have yielded many referred specimens of R. olseni including NCSM 21647, NCSM 23539, 41-46, 48-50, 52-57, NCSM 24722, 58-62 and NCSM 25194-227. NCSM 24728, 25192-3 and 25228 were referred to ?Revueltosaurus. Some osteoderms were referred to it to, as they very similar to those seen in the Petrified Forest material of R. callenderi. R. olseni is thought to be one of the most common tetrapods from its assemblage. Irmis et al. (2007) and Nesbitt et al. (2007) tentatively synonymized Pekinosaurus (and Galtonia) with Revueltosaurus, and refer its type series to Revueltosaurus sp. They noted that Hunt and Lucas (1994) did not provide any differential diagnosis, autapomorphies, or unique combination of characters for Pekinosaurus. Furthermore, they argued that it cannot be differentiated from R. callenderi. Heckert et al. (2012) agreed that R. olseni is extremely similar to R. callenderi, however they found that Pekinosaurus teeth have slightly different proportions and outline than R. callenderi. They provided a differential diagnosis for that species and referred it to Revueltosaurus, under the new combination R. olseni. Classification Restoration All species of Revueltosaurus were thought to represent monospecific genera of basal ornithischian dinosaurs based on their teeth. New discoveries of skeletal material of R. callenderi have suggested that Revueltosaurus is a pseudosuchian. According to William Parker, \\"we have pretty much erased the record of Triassic ornithischian dinosaurs from North America, Europe and worldwide, except for South America.\\"Quoted in Sanders 2005, para. 6. His co- author Randall Irmis said, \\"because the teeth look like those we know from herbivorous ornithischians, people assigned them to the dinosaurs. We think we've shown that you can't rely on the dentition to determine what is an early dinosaur, which casts doubt on all the ornithischians from the Triassic of North America\\".Quoted in Sanders 2005, para. 4. Nearly complete specimens of R. callenderi were tested in a broad phylogenetic analysis of basal archosaurs for the first time when Sterling J. Nesbitt included the specimens PEFO 34561 and PEFO 34269 (a complete and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively) in his 2011 phylogenetic analysis. Revueltosaurus was placed at the base of the clade Suchia as the sister taxon to the armored and herbivorous aetosaurs. However, Revueltosaurus itself is not an aetosaur, since Aetosauria was redefined to exclude it. The analysis found Gracilisuchus, Turfanosuchus and the Revueltosaurus+Aetosauria clade to nest in a large polytomy with Ticinosuchus+Paracrocodylomorpha. The cladogram below follows Nesbitt (2011).

It continues ticking along, as a perfect machine, with its gears governed by the laws of physics, making every aspect of the machine predictable.  History  This idea was very popular among deists during the Enlightenment, when Isaac Newton derived his laws of motion, and showed that alongside the law of universal gravitation, they could predict the behaviour of both terrestrial objects and the solar system. A similar concept goes back, to John of Sacrobosco's early 13th-century introduction to astronomy: On the Sphere of the World. In this widely popular medieval text, Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the machina mundi, the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine.John of Sacrbosco, On the Sphere, quoted in Edward Grant, A Source Book in Medieval Science, (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1974), p. 465. Responding to Gottfried Leibniz, a prominent supporter of the theory, in the Leibniz‚ÄìClarke correspondence, Samuel Clarke wrote: :\\"The Notion of the World's being a great Machine, going on without the Interposition of God, as a Clock continues to go without the Assistance of a Clockmaker; is the Notion of Materialism and Fate, and tends, (under pretence of making God a Supra-mundane Intelligence,) to exclude Providence and God's Government in reality out of the World.\\"Davis, Edward B. 1991. \\"Newton's rejection of the \\"Newtonian world view\\" : the role of divine will in Newton's natural philosophy.\\" Science and Christian Belief 3, no. 2: 103-117.

It is located in the south-western suburbs of Paris, from the center of Paris. Jouy-en-Josas is home to the main campus of HEC School of Management. Geography Jouy-en-Josas is four kilometres to the south-east of Versailles, and 19r km to the south-west of Paris, in the middle of the valley of the Bi√®vre river. A town with nearly eight thousand inhabitants, half of Jouy-en-Josas is covered by forest. The communes that surround Jouy-en-Josas are V√©lizy-Villacoublay, to the north-east, Bi√®vres to the east, Saclay to the south, Toussus-le-Noble to the extreme south-west, Les Loges-en-Josas to the west, Buc to the north-west and Versailles to the north- north-west. History Jouy is a direct translation of Latin gaudium, both meaning \\"joy\\". Josas was the ancient name of an archdiaconate of the archbishop of Paris. Although many discoveries in various parts of the town attest to there once having been a Gallo-Roman presence there, the first traces of the construction of a village are of the ninth century. Stimulated by the presence of monks from the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris, Jouy grew rapidly, but the population was progressively annihilated in the fourteenth century by a number of wars and epidemics. By 1466, there were only three houses left in the village. From that date forward, Jouy became home to several aristocratic families. A number of seigneurs from Jouy had close relations with the kings: Antoine d'Aquin was the personal doctor to Louis XIV, and his grandson, Antoine-Louis de Rouill√©, became Secretary of State of the Navy and Foreign Affairs under Louis XV. In 1759, Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf, an entrepreneur of German origins, moved to Jouy-en-Josas and started a factory there, which produced toile de Jouy, a cotton fabric printed with isolated engraved vignettes of historical figures or landscapes, usually printed in red or green on white cotton. He became the town's first mayor in 1790. Industry started to wane in 1799 and even further in 1815, when Napoleon was toppled and Oberkampf died. Oberkampf's motto, \\"Recte et Viligenter\\", Latin for \\"Uprightness and Vigilance\\", was used by the commune for its coat of arms. The Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art settled in Jouy-en-Josas for a short time, before moving to the Boulevard Raspail in Paris. Jouy is also the home of the HEC School of Management, one of the renowned grandes √©coles, which moved there from Paris in 1964. Main sights * The Roman Catholic Church of St Martin is a landmark of the town, characterized by its bell- tower. The oldest parts of the present church date back to the thirteenth century. Inside, one can admire many interesting statues and sculptures, out of which, a statue of the Virgin Mary is most prominent. The Church also preserves a painting of Jesus from the nineteenth century, by the little-known painter F√©lix Hullin de Boischevalier (1808-89.) * The tomb of Christophe- Philippe Oberkampf * The Chateau de l'√âglantine, built by Mar√©chal Canrobert, is now a museum concerning toile de Jouy and its history. * The Ch√¢teau de Vilvert, built for Baron Cabrol de Mont√©, the mayor of Jouy from 1868 to 1879. * The house of L√©on Blum and his cousin and third wife, Jeanne, who settled in Jouy after the Second World War. The house, called the Clos des Metz, has an office and library preserved just as Leon Blum had them. Population Inhabitants are called Jovaciens. Economy Jouy-en-Josas has a very low unemployment rate. According to data from 1999, the rate of unemployment in Jouy was only 5.4%, compared to a national rate of 12.9%. The income of an average Jovacian is twice as high as the national average: the average Jovacian earns around ‚Ç¨43,934 per year, compared to the French average of ‚Ç¨20,363. 41 companies were established in Jouy-en-Josas in 2004 alone. The town is estimated to have around 400 businesses in all sectors of the economy. The town is home to both traditionally French small businesses and to artisans. The area around Petit Robinson has also attracted many tertiary industries. Jouy-en-Josas is home to a number of eminent higher education and research centres, such as HEC School of Management, the CRC (Centre for Managerial Research and Studies), and the INRA (National Institute for Agronomic Research.)

His plans to form a provisional autonomous government led to his arrest and deposition. Origins and military career Iturrigaray was born of a family of wealthy Vizca√≠no (Basque) merchants in C√°diz. His parents were Jos√© Yturrigaray y Gainza, born in Pamplona, Navarre, and Mar√≠a Manuela de Ar√≥stegui y Larrea, born in Aranaz, Navarre. Under Charles III in 1762 he took part in the Spanish invasion of Portugal and in Gibraltar. In 1793, now under Charles IV, he earned fame for the courage shown in the War of the Pyrenees with Republican France. In 1801 he was commander in chief of the army of Andaluc√≠a in the so-called War of the Oranges with Portugal, under the command of Generalissimo Manuel de Godoy. As viceroy of New Spain After serving as governor of C√°diz from 1793 to 1798, Iturrigaray was named viceroy of New Spain by Godoy. Iturrigaray arrived in the colony in 1803 with his wife, Mar√≠a In√©s de J√°uregui y Ar√≥stegui. She was the daughter of Agustin de Ja√∫regui y Aldecoa, Viceroy of Peru, born in Lec√°roz, Valle de Bazt√°n, Navarra, and Mar√≠a Luisa de Ar√≥stegui y Bassave, born in Habana, Cuba, a first cousin of Jos√© de Iturrigaray y Ar√≥stegui. When he passed through customs at Veracruz, he brought with him a huge shipment of goods, which entered free of duty because he declared it his personal baggage. The king sent him a large quantity of arms, which the viceroy provided to the regiments of Mexico and Puebla, then stationed in Cuba. Iturrigaray soon gained popularity for his friendly and jovial character, which contrasted with the austere character of his predecessor, F√©lix Berenguer de Marquina. The king had ordered that the vineyards currently under cultivation could continue, but that the viceroy could not issue licenses for new vineyards. In 1803 the viceroy complained to the United States about the American vessels smuggling and fishing in waters of New Spain, particularly in California and Sonora. In June he visited the current state of Guanajuato, for the announced purpose of opening a public granary. He also inspected the mines of La Valenciana and Rayas, and received a present of 1,000 ounces of gold. He offered to request from Spain a sufficient amount of mercury to work the mines. Passing through Celaya, he granted permission for the Ayuntamiento (city government) there to celebrate corridas (bullfights), and to build a bridge over the R√≠o La Laja. The bridge was to be constructed under the direction of the architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras. On December 9, 1803 he inaugurated Manuel Tols√°'s bronze equestrian statue of Charles IV in the Z√≥calo in the Center of Mexico City. The first stone in the pedestal had been laid July 18, 1796 by then-Viceroy Miguel de la Gr√∫a Talamanca y Branciforte, marqu√©s de Branciforte, and the statue had been cast on August 4, 1802. On March 22, 1803 the Prussian explorer and naturalist Baron Alexander von Humboldt arrived in Acapulco from Peru in the ship Pizarro. Humboldt spent a year in New Spain, spending time in Mexico City and especially important time in the mining area of Guanajuato. Since the crown had given Humboldt unlimited access to travel and investigate New Spain, Iturrigaray directly aided Humboldt's research, first published in his Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain. Humboldt estimated the population of New Spain to be 6 million. On March 18, 1804 an expedition for the propagation of smallpox vaccine under Dr. Francisco Javier de Balmis also arrived. The viceroy's reception of this expedition was less enthusiastic than the leaders had anticipated. Nevertheless, Dr. Juan Arboleya vaccinated the son of the viceroy. In March 1805 news was received in New Spain of the renewed declaration of war by Spain against Britain. Iturrigaray received orders to put the colony in a state of defense, and to increase the regular payments to Spain. To do this, he applied the C√©dula de la Caja de Consolidaci√≥n. This order was the equivalent of disentailment of the church because it ordered the transfer of income from the religious estates and foundations to the government. A direct result of this order was the strengthening of the Spanish opponents of the viceroyalty, who raised protests. Among them was Bishop Manuel Abad y Queipo. Popular discontent grew with the increase in taxes. So did the discontent of the Peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain), because of the favor shown by the viceroy to the Criollos (Spaniards born in America). And among the latter there began to appear a spirit of independence inspired by news of the disturbance at Aranjuez and the political defeat of Godoy. Iturrigaray saw the necessity of relying on the Criollo party to maintain his power. On April 30, 1803, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States for 80 million francs. In 1806, that country asked the Marqu√©s de Casa Calvo, to remove the Spanish troops from New Orleans so that the United States could take possession of the area up to the Sabine River. The situation in Spain In 1808 Napoleon's French invaded Spain. As the French forces approached Madrid, the royal family decided to flee to New Spain. This idea, however, was poorly received by the Spanish populace. On March 17, 1808 a riot broke out at Aranjuez. The hated Godoy was apprehended by the crowd, humiliated, stripped of his honors, and nearly killed. The mob, loyal to Prince Ferdinand (later King Ferdinand VII), forced Charles to abdicate in his son's behalf. Ferdinand then had Godoy arrested. But in May, all three -- Godoy, Ferdinand and Charles -- were enticed across the French border, where Napoleon took them prisoner. Napoleon forced the abdication of both Ferdinand and Charles in favor of himself. He then named his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, king of Spain. On May 2, 1808, the people of Madrid rose in arms against the French. This was the spark that began a country-wide revolt. Everywhere provisional juntas were organized claiming to govern in the name of Ferdinand VII. The consequences in New Spain Iturrigaray had been appointed viceroy with orders to put down any rebellion, but the situation in Spain with the Napoleonic invasion, and the \\"political events back home bewildered him.\\"Gobernantes de Mexico, 1325-1911. Mexico: Artes de M√©xico. No. 175, p. 91. News of the situation in Spain was received in Mexico on June 23, 1808, and the following July 14, news of the abdication of the Spanish king in favor of Napoleon was also received. The Cabildo (city council) of Mexico City was composed of professional men, Criollos. On July 19, 1808, councilmen Juan Francisco Azc√°rate y Ledesma and Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos presented a plan to form a provisional, autonomous government of New Spain, with Iturrigaray at its head. The justification for this was that the mother country was now occupied by foreign troops, and the royal family was being held prisoner. The plan was accepted by the viceroy and the Cabildo, but not by the Audiencia. On July 20, 1808, Diego Le√±o of the Ayuntamiento of Jalapa, called for a congress of representatives from throughout New Spain. The Criollo party continued to agitate, asking for the formation of a junta, as in Spain, and the convening of a congress. Once again the Audiencia was opposed, arguing that New Spain was a colony, and not permitted to take this kind of decision. On August 9, 1808, at a meeting of Notables, the lawyer Primo Verdad y Ramos spoke in favor of popular sovereignty. Some of the oidores (judges on the Audiencia) spoke in rebuttal, declaring the proposal seditious and subversive. Inquisitor Bernardo Prado y Ovejero declared it heresy and anathema. The Notables adopted an intermediate position -- New Spain would recognize no authority above the king of Spain. On August 31, 1808 the crisis took a sharper turn with the arrival of Juan Gabriel Jabat, representative of the Junta of Seville, and a message from the Junta of Asturias. Both juntas requested recognition as the legitimate government of Spain by New Spain, thus providing evidence of the lack of any legitimate government in the country. On September 1, 1808, Melchor de Talamantes, a Peruvian priest and the intellectual leader of the Criollo party, delivered two tracts to the Cabildo, in favor of separation from Spain and of the convoking of a Mexican congress. His premises were that all ties to Spain had now been broken; that regional laws had to be made, independently of the mother country; that the Audiencia could not speak in behalf of the king; and that the king having disappeared, sovereignty was now vested in the people. It looked as if open fighting would break out between the mostly Peninsular partisans of the Audiencia and the Criollo ones of the Cabildo. A further meeting on September 9 was tumultuous. Coup deposing the viceroy Viceroy Iturrigaray and his family, 1805 Iturrigaray was strongly inclined towards the party of the Criollos and held in great suspicion by the Spanish party. He had received Criollo petitions for a congress and disrecognition of the Spanish junta. He had ordered 40,000 pesos sent to the Consulado of Veracruz, notoriously liberal in outlook. He had nominated Criollos to high positions in the administration. And most importantly, he had mobilized the regiment of dragoons from Aguascalientes, stationed in Jalapa. This regiment was under the command of Colonel Ignacio Obreg√≥n, an intimate friend of the viceroy. Iturrigaray was on the point of resigning when, on September 15, 1808 the pro-Spanish party, headed by Gabriel J. de Yermo, arrested him. Yermo was supported by the rich Spanish merchants, by the oidores Aguirre and Bataller, by the archbishop, and by the judges of the Inquisition. Five hundred well- armed conspirators attacked the viceregal palace at 2 in the morning. One soldier was killed. The members of the Cabildo were also arrested. After Iturrigaray was taken prisoner, he was conducted to the Inquisition, so that the populace could be made to believe he had been deposed for heresy. His wife and children were taken to the convent of San Bernardo. The vicereine was cruelly insulted and her jewelry was stolen. The viceroy was deposed by the Audiencia. An inventory of the viceroy's valuables was ordered, and the total came to more than one million pesos. This was considered evidence that the viceroy had taken advantage of the situation for his personal enrichment. In accordance with custom, the unanticipated vacancy in the office of viceroy was filled with the oldest and highest-ranking military officer in the colony, Marshall Pedro de Garibay, an octogenarian controlled by the Audiencia. Primo Verdad y Ramos and Melchor de Talamantes were imprisoned, and died in jail. Also imprisoned were Lic. Cristo, Juan Francisco Azc√°rate and French general Octaviano d'Alv√≠mar.General Octaviano d'Alvimar (or Delvimere), emissary of Napoleon, had crossed Texas to enter Mexico in order to promote the revolution against Spain there and to establish plans which would make it possible for Napoleon to control Spanish America. Return to Spain On September 21, 1808, Iturrigaray was sent as a prisoner to Spain. He was brought to trial in C√°diz for disloyalty. The charges were not proven and he was freed under the amnesty granted by the Cortes in 1810. A juicio de residencia continued after the amnesty, and was ended only by the death of Iturrigaray in 1815, but not before he was assessed a fine of 435,000 pesetas. According to most historians, he was also implicated in a private scheme by James Wilkinson to head off an invasion of Mexico by Aaron Burr.

Jean- Baptiste Marie Huet (Paris, 15 October 1745 - Paris, 27 January 1811) was a French painter, engraver and designer associated with pastoral and genre scenes of animals in the Rococo manner, influenced by Fran√ßois Boucher. Born into a family of artists-- his uncle was Christophe Huet, his father Nicolas Huet--he apprenticed with the animal painter Charles Dagomer, a member of the painters' guild, the Acad√©mie de Saint-Luc, Paris, who was working in the 1760s. Huet‚Äôs interest in printmaking and his acquaintance with Gilles Demarteau, who later engraved many of his compositions, both date from this period. About 1764 Huet entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Le Prince, where he further developed his printmaking skills, largely reproducing his own paintings, a method of publishing them with some profit. In 1768 he was approved (agr√©√©) by the Acad√©mie Royale, and 29 July 1769 he was received (re√ßu) in the minor category (petite mani√®re) of painter of animals and was well received in the public reviews when he began to exhibit at the Paris Salon that same year, with a Dog Attacking Geese, now at the Louvre. He continued to exhibit annually until 1789, though his attempts at the grand manner of history painting, considered the noblest genre, were not met with approval. The most important of his paintings were his morceau de r√©ception, the Fox among the Chickens (San Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor), The Dairymaid (Paris, Mus√©e Cognacq-Jay). Huet is equally known for his designs for the decorative arts. He provided scenic vignettes to be printed by copperplate on cottons at the manufacture of toiles de Jouy directed by Oberkampf. Lengths of these may be seen at The Detroit Institute of Arts, the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and many other institutions. His ink-and-wash drawings and studies of animals and children are also admired. In the 1780s he provided tapestry cartoons for the manufacture at Beauvais. A suite of thirteen hangings of pastorals was in the Isaac de Camondo bequest to the Louvre. In 1790 he remained attached to the reorganized and combined tapestry manufacture of Gobelins and Beauvais.

The initial collection was of 22 tail vertebrae, including a series of 16 consecutive bones, and other fragmentary hindlimb pieces. Soon after Longman announced the new discovery, he visited the station and arranged for more material of the same skeleton to be sent to the Queensland Museum. These included additional vertebrae from the thoracic area, bits of rib, more caudals and more of the femur and pelvis as well as a cervical vertebra. Further material was collected by Mary Wade and Alan Bartholomai in 1975, and still more by Drs. Tom Rich, Anne Warren, Zhao Xijin, and Ralph Molnar. By 2012, prepared material comprised 40 vertebrae, five partial thoracic ribs, part of the sacrum, fragments of the ilia, an ischium, the left and right pubic bones, and much of the right hind limb (femur, tibia, fibula, astragalus, and pes). More bones are yet to be removed from rock. Rhoetosaurus is among the best-known sauropods thus far discovered in Australia, as well as for the Jurassic of Gondwana.  Relationships  Initially Longman, with advice from leading German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene, noted the primitive nature of Rhoetosaurus, and so for a long time, it was called a cetiosaurid. More recently, others have compared it to Shunosaurus, based on similar general age, but without justification. Given its supposed relationship to Shunosaurus, which had a clubbed tail, Rhoetosaurus has also been hypothesized to possess something similar. The form of the nearly complete hind foot ()at least suggests that lies outside the more derived Neosauropoda, but the material needs further study to determine its precise positioning in sauropod evolution.

The camera shifted to Chase Daniel, who was visibly perplexed and curious as to who was talking about him and why it was being heard throughout the entire stadium. ABC TV announcer Brent Musburger then mused, \\"Lisa was talking to a lot more folks than she anticipated.\\" The likely explanation was that Salters' mic was to have been hooked up to the PA for the upcoming halftime contest, and her microphone was inadvertently left on the PA after a pregame sound check. Prior to joining ESPN, Salters served as a Los Angeles-based correspondent for ABC News from 1995 to 2000 and provided news coverage for World News Tonight with Peter Jennings and other ABC News broadcasts.

He was a member of the New York State Senate (18th D.) in 1917 and 1918; and then an assistant Attorney General of the United States. As such, Ottinger ruled that the U.S. Congress could grant independence to the Philippines if it wished, since the Philippines were an \\"insular possession\\" and therefore to be distinguished from the United States' states and territorial possessions.\\"Declares Congress May Free Filipinos,\\" New York Times (May 3, 1924), p. 7.

During his second term, he was the only Republican who held state office, and was responsible for closing down the notorious \\"bucket shops\\" on Wall Street. He was a delegate to the 1928 and 1932 Republican National Conventions. In 1928, while the Democratic Party nominated New York Governor Al Smith for the Presidency, the first time a Catholic from a major party was running for that office, the Republican Party of New York nominated Ottinger for governor, the first Jewish gubernatorial candidate in New York history. The Democratic Party nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt for governor, and Herbert Lehman, also a Jew, as the candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York. On the national ticket, Herbert Hoover won by a landslide over Al Smith, the latter's religion clearly a national issue. The gubernatorial contest, however, was one of the closest in New York history. Against the national Republican trend, Roosevelt won by only 25,000 votes, less than 1% of the four million ballots cast. At the end of his term as New York state's attorney general, Ottinger summed up his record as follows: \\"Hammer, hammer, hammer, at every manner and means of fraud and dishonesty, the prevention and assertion of which the Legislature has assigned to the Attorney General.\\" Ottinger died in New York City on January 13, 1938.

His work included W√∂rlitz Palace in the present-day Dessau- W√∂rlitz Garden Realm, one of the earliest Palladian buildings on the European continent. His most well-known student was Friedrich Gilly, the teacher of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Life Erdmannsdorff was born in Dresden to the Saxon courtier, Baron Ernst Ferdinand von Erdmannsdorff, and his wife Henriette Margarethe, n√©e von He√üler. Prince Franz von Anhalt-Dessau, portrait by Christoph Friedrich Reinhold Lisiewski (1762) After early stages of education with Jakob Mauvillon in Leipzig and at the Dresden knight academy from 1750 to 1754, Erdmannsdorff attended the University of Wittenberg in 1754‚Äì1758, where he encountered Prince Franz von Anhalt-Dessau, whose service he entered in 1758. His later fame is due his works for the prince in his W√∂rlitz pleasureground near the Dessau residence. At the age of twenty three Erdmannsdorff become a Freemason and was initiated at the illustrious Minerva Zu Den Drei Palmen (Minerva to the three palm trees) lodge on 23 August 1759. In accordance with the educational ideals of the Enlightenment, the prince had the aim of reorganising his surrounding lands into a cohesive 'Garden Realm' (Gartenreich) in the style of an English landscape garden. In addition to the beautification of the landscape, cottages of various architectural styles, antique temples, bridges and memorials were to be erected and to be made accessible to everyone. Franz employed his friend and architect Erdmannsdorff to design the architectural arrangement of the grounds. Between 1761 and 1775 on several grand tours to Italy, Holland, England, France and Switzerland, Erdmannsdorff gathered ideas for the architectural arrangement of the W√∂rlitz grounds. Accompanying the Prince, he got to know the style of the Scottish architects Robert and James Adam (the Adams Style). At the same time he was impressed by the architect William Chambers. In Rome Erdmannsdorff made the acquaintance of the archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann and the painter Charles Louis Cl√©risseau, and contacted the master builder Giovanni Battista Piranesi and painter Jakob Philipp Hackert. The contemporary art and culture of England made a particular impression on Erdmannsdorff as well as Prince Franz. The Palladian architecture in England, inspired by the Palladian Villas of the 16th century, can be seen replicated in Erdmannsdorff's later creations and was the strongest influence on his work next to the architecture and interior design of ancient Rome. In this artistic context he designed, amongst others, W√∂rlitz Palace, built from 1769 to 1773 for Prince Franz and his consort Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Although Erdmannsdorff favoured this particular architectural style, he also created buildings in the Neo-Gothic style preferred by Prince Franz. Among others, he converted the influences he had received on his trip to England into the building of the Gothic House in the W√∂rlitz Grounds. During his time in Anhalt-Dessau, Erdmannsdorff married Wilhelmine von Ahlimb in 1781, with whom he had two daughters. In 1786 King Frederick William II of Prussia called on his services to redecorate the bedroom and study of his predecessor, Frederick the Great, in Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, as well a number of rooms in the Berliner Stadtschloss (Berlin City Palace). Consequently, the first consistently classical interior of the Potsdam and Berlin palaces was built to Erdmannsdorff's specifications. During his stay in Berlin and Potsdam which lasted until 1789, he became an honorary member of the 'Royal Academy of Arts and Mechanical Sciences' in Berlin. Apart from this work he was above all active as a consultant in the areas of art, culture and education in Brandenburg. Between 1789 and 1790, Erdmannsdorff stayed again in Italy. In Rome he made the acquaintance of the painters Angelica Kauffman and Jakob Phillipp Hackert, as well as the sculptors Alexander Trippel, Antonio Canova and Bartolomeo Cavaceppi. After a trip to Weimar in 1791 with Prince Franz, he visited the courts of Gotha, Kassel and Karlsruhe. In 1796 he took over the artistic direction of the Chalkographische Gesellschaft in Dessau, founded in 1795, whose goal was to popularise artistic works through etchings.

The current type and only species is S. leedsi, and the holotype is a single partial left mandible. The genus and species were named in 1893 by Richard Lydekker, who thought they belonged to a theropod. Discovery Sarcolestes was first named in 1893 by Richard Lydekker, and its type species was designated as S. leedsi. The specific name was to honour Alfred Nicholson Leeds, the discoverer of the specimen, and many others like it. The holotype and only specimen, is a partial left mandible and fused scute that was damaged during excavation. The jaw preserved one entire tooth and two crown tips in its alveolus, with the missing bone in the central section of the mandible. It lacks a preserved predentary, even though the entire mandibular symphysis is preserved and complete. Classification Originally, Lydekker found that Sarcolestes represented a theropod. He cited lack of a predentary as excluding the taxon from ornithopods, and tooth morphology as excluding it from sauropods. Within theropods, it was found to be sufficiently different from one main groups of theropods including Coelurus, Calamosaurus, and Compsognathus, and the megalosaurids including Megalosaurus. Thus, Lydekker placed it in Thecodontosauridae, a group of theropods (now placed in sauropodomorpha) including Thecodontosaurus. Lydekker noted that Sarcolestes was similar in dental morphology to Priodontognathus, and that together they might be shown to be related to scelidosaurids. However, he also noted that together they may represent their own group within Theropoda. In 1901, Franz Nopcsa found that Sarcolestes was in fact herbivorous, and classified it in Stegosauridae with genera such as Polacanthus, Stegosaurus, Hylaeosaurus, Stenopelix and various others. Peter Galton concluded that Sarcolestes represents a genus within Nodosauridae, with a dentary similar to that of Sauropelta. However, others have cast doubt on this assignment and even the validity of Sarcolestes.

It lived during the Hettangian-Sinemurian boundary of the Early Jurassic, about 199-194 million years ago. Sarcosaurus is one of the earliest known Jurassic theropods, and one of only a handful of theropod genera from this time period. Along with Dracoraptor hanigani it is one of the two described neotheropods from the lowermost Jurassic of the United Kingdom. Description Pelvis and parts of femur and dorsal vertebra The holotype is NHMUK PV R4840 that includes a posterior dorsal vertebra, partial left and right ilia, that are fused to the proximal portion of the pubis, lacking the femoral head. The specimen shows some evidence of skeletal maturity, meaning it is not an early juvenile, but its exact ontogenetic stage cannot be ascertained. Referred specimens include the non mature NHMUK PV R3542 (holotype of Sarcosaurus andrewsi) that includes a complete right tibia; WARMS G667‚Äì690, a partial skeleton of a single individual that includes posterior dorsal vertebra, middle caudal vertebra, dorsal rib fragments, left ilium, right and left pubes, femora and tibiae, proximal end of left fibula, probable distal half of fibula, distal portions of metatarsals IV, II or III proximal half of left pedal phalanx II-1, and three indeterminate bone fragments.Carrano and Sampson (2004). \\"A review of coelophysoids (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Jurassic of Europe, with comments on the late history of the Coelophysoidea.\\" N. Jb. Geol. Palaont. Mh., 2004(9): 537-558. Sarcosaurus shares certain morphological conditions with other neotheropods, including Liliensternus liliensterni (collateral fossae of the metatarsal II with similar development and shape on both sides, larger ratio on the centrum) and Dilophosaurus wetherilli (lateral collateral fossa is bigger than the medial one in the metatarsal, middle caudal series proportionately lower and narrower than the middle‚àíposterior dorsal vertebra). Sarcosaurus was a bipedal predator, probably able to run fast and catch small prey. The holotype belonged to a 3.5 m long animal whose weight was no greater than 50-60 kg. NHMUK PV R3542 belonged to a larger animal, estimated to have had a maximum length of 5 m and a weight of 140 kg.Molina-P√©rez, R., Larramendi, A., Connolly, D., & Cruz, G. √Å. R. (2019). Dinosaur Facts and Figures: The Theropods and Other Dinosauriformes. Princeton University Press. History of discovery The fossils of Sarcosaurus were found in the Lower Lias of England. The type species, Sarcosaurus woodi, was first described by Charles William Andrews in 1921 shortly after a partial skeleton had been found by S.L. Wood near Barrow-on-Soar, in the Scunthorpe Mudstone. The generic name is derived from Greek sarx, \\"flesh\\". The specific name honours Wood. The holotype, BMNH 4840/1, consists of a pelvis, a vertebra and the upper part of a femur. The preserved length of the femur is .Andrews, C.W., 1921, \\"On some remains of a theropodous dinosaur from the Lower Lias of Barrow-on-Soar\\", Annals and Magazine of Natural History, series 9 8: 570-576 A second species, Sarcosaurus andrewsi, was named by Friedrich von Huene in 1932,von Huene, F., 1932, Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte, Monographien zur Geologie und Palaeontologie 1(4) pp. 361 based on a tibia, BMNH R3542, described by Arthur Smith Woodward in 1908 and found near Wilmcote.Woodward, A.S. 1908. \\"Note on a megalosaurian tibia from the Lower Lias of Wilmcote, Warwickshire\\". Annals and Magazine of Natural History. 8(1): 257-259 Confusingly von Huene in the same publication named the very same fossil Magnosaurus woodwardi. Later he made a choice for S. andrewsi to be the valid name.Huene, F. von, 1956, Pal√§ontologie und Phylogenie der niederen Tetrapoden. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena. 716 pp Huene also discussed WARMS G667‚Äì690, a partial skeleton also from Wilmcote, both specimens are from the Blue Lias. In 1974 S. andrewsi was reclassified as Megalosaurus andrewsi by Michael Waldman, on the probably erroneous assumption it was a megalosaurid.Waldman, M. 1974. \\"Megalosaurids from the Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) of Dorset\\". Paleontology 17(2): 325-339 A later study concluded the two species to be indistinguishable except for size, but other authors consider any identity to be unprovable as there are no comparable remains and conclude both species to lack autapomorphies and therefore to be nomina dubia.D.

The specimen is likely one individual, located in the same stratiagraphic position as the holotypic specimen. Unfortunately, there are few available overlapping elements from the specimen and the Holotype. Both specimens preserve a relatively complete femur: however, the features of both (an anteromedially directed head, a relatively long fourth trochanter and a trochanteric shelf) are plesiomorphic and thus do not indicate conspecifity or clade membership. It is noted, however, that there are no features which are present in one specimen but not the other. Phylogeny Andrews originally assigned Sarcosaurus to the Megalosauridae. The first to suggest a more basal position was Samuel Paul Welles who placed it in the Coelophysidae.S.P.

These terms may refer to people who are born in Scotland and of Italian descent. It can also refer to people of mixed Scottish and Italian ancestry. A recent Italian voter census estimated that there are 70,000 to 100,000 people in Scotland of Italian descent or Italian nationals, which is up to 1.9% of the overall Scottish population. Latest available figures from the 2011 UK Census show there were 6,048 people born in Italy living in Scotland. This was up from 4,936 in 2001 and 3,947 recorded in 1991. In 2016, Ronnie Convery, secretary of the Italian Scotland charitable organisation and director of communications at the Archdiocese of Glasgow, asserted that a completely new dimension was being added to the Scots-Italians community. He said, ‚ÄúThere has been a brand new migration over the past two years, and the biggest one we have seen in 100 years.\\" The majority come from the provinces of Lucca, Parma, Frosinone and Isernia. History Arguably the first people from Italy to reach Scotland were the Romans in and around 40AD, although the modern nation of Italy did not exist at the time and of course the Roman Empire was a cosmopolitan institution, with some Roman Emperors from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Still, the Romans were for the most part from what is now Italy and they did leave their mark on Scotland at Antonine Wall and other monumental constructions, although it was not until the end of the 19th century that an Italian-Scots identity really began to take shape. Many Italian-Scots can trace their ancestry back to the 1890s where their forefathers escaped drought, famine and poverty in their homeland for a better life in Scotland; yet it was not until World War I that a sizeable population of Italian- Scots‚Äîover 4,000‚Äîbegan to emerge, with Glasgow hosting the third largest community in the United Kingdom. Since then, there has been a steady flow of migration between the two countries. Italy and the fascist involvement in World War II brought many hardships on Italians settled in Scotland - many families were separated as adult males were interned. The family members that were left behind were forced to cope with mistrust and discrimination. Of those imprisoned many men found themselves held in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. A number of others were employed in Orkney, at Scapa Flow, to construct a barrier against Nazi U-boats. These men additionally constructed the Chapel of Lambholm from scrap metal and junk. Nowadays, this Chapel is one of Orkney's most popular tourist attractions. Today, Italian Scots can be found working in all manner of professions. However, a large proportion of the community have plied their trade in the catering industry, working in the chip shops, ice-cream parlours, pizzerias and restaurants across Scotland.

One species (S. edwardsorum) has been named although others may have existed. Anatomically, Sauropelta is one of the most well-understood nodosaurids, with fossilized remains recovered in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Montana, and possibly Utah. It is also the earliest known genus of nodosaurid; most of its remains are found in a section of the Cloverly Formation dated to 108.5 million years ago. It was a medium-sized nodosaurid, measuring about long. Sauropelta had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length. Although its body was smaller than a modern black rhinoceros, Sauropelta was about the same mass, weighing in at about . The extra weight was largely due to its extensive covering of bony armor, including the characteristically large spines projecting from its neck. Description Sauropelta edwardsorum with a human for scale Sauropelta was a heavily built quadrupedal herbivore with a body length of approximately . In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated it at 6 meters (19.7 ft) and 2 tonnes (2.2 short tons). Thomas Holtz gave a higher estimation of 7.6 meters (25 feet). The skull was triangular when viewed from above, with the rear end wider than the tapering snout. One skull measured 35 centimeters (13.75 in) in width at its widest point, behind the eyes. Unlike some other nodosaurids, the roof of the skull was characteristically flat, not domed. The roof of the skull was very thick and covered in flat, bony plates that are so tightly fused that there appear to be no sutures (boundaries) like the ones seen in Panoplosaurus, Pawpawsaurus, Silvisaurus, and many other ankylosaurs. This could also be an artifact of preservation or preparation. As in other ankylosaurs, thick triangular scutes projected from the postorbital bone, above and behind the eyes, as well as the jugal bone, below and behind the eyes. More typically for nodosaurids, leaf-shaped teeth lined both upper and lower jaws, used for cutting plant material. The front end of the skull is unknown, but there would have been a sharp bony ridge (tomium) at the end of both upper and lower jaws, as seen in other ankylosaurs. This ridge probably would have supported a keratinous beak. The tail of Sauropelta was characteristically long and made up nearly half of the body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb). Restoration Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta was covered in armor formed from bony masses embedded in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down the top of the neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin was covered in small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again along the side of the body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail. Classification and systematics Since John Ostrom first described Sauropelta in 1970, it has been recognized as a member of the family Nodosauridae. The nodosaurids, along with the family Ankylosauridae, belong within the infraorder Ankylosauria. Nodosaurids are characterized by certain features of the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), which curves downwards at the end. Overall, nodosaurids had narrower snouts than the ankylosaurids, and also lacked the heavy ankylosaurid tail clubs. Nodosaurids, like ankylosaurids, are found in North America, Asia, and Europe. While the systematics (evolutionary relationships) of nodosaurids have not been firmly established, the genera Sauropelta, Silvisaurus and Pawpawsaurus are sometimes considered to be basal to geologically younger nodosaurids like Panoplosaurus, Edmontonia, and Animantarx. In a 2001 analysis, Carpenter included the former three genera in a sister clade to a group containing the latter three, although he found that Panoplosaurus could belong to either clade, depending which taxa and characters were chosen. Discovery and naming AMNH specimen In the early 1930s, famed dinosaur hunter and paleontologist Barnum Brown collected the holotype specimen of Sauropelta (AMNH 3032, a partial skeleton) from the Cloverly Formation in Big Horn County, Montana. The locality is inside the Crow Indian Reservation. Brown also discovered two other specimens (AMNH 3035 and 3036). The latter is one of the best-preserved nodosaurid skeletons known to science, includes a large amount of in situ armor, and is on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. AMNH 3035 preserves the cervical armor and most of a skull, missing only the end of the snout. Expeditions in the 1960s led by the equally renowned John Ostrom of Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History recovered additional incomplete specimens from the Cloverly. In 1970, Ostrom coined the genus Sauropelta to include remains discovered by both expeditions. Derived from the Greek œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ (') ('lizard') and œÄŒµŒªœÑŒµ (') ('shield'), this name is a reference to its bony armor. Although Ostrom originally named the species S. edwardsi, nomenclaturist George Olshevsky corrected the spelling to S. edwardsorum in 1991 to conform to Latin grammar rules. Close up of armour, AMNH Despite the naming of Sauropelta two years earlier, confusion arose in 1972 when the name \\"Peltosaurus\\" was inadvertently published as the caption of a photograph of AMNH 3036. Although Brown never published a name or description for the remains which are now known as Sauropelta edwardsorum, \\"Peltosaurus\\" was the name he informally used in lectures and museum exhibits. However, the name Peltosaurus was preoccupied by a genus of North American lizard from an extinct branch of the modern family Anguidae (the alligator lizards and the legless glass lizards) and is no longer used to refer to the dinosaur. In 1999, Carpenter and colleagues described material of a large nodosaurid from Utah, discovered in a member of the Cedar Mountain Formation called the Poison Strip Sandstone, which is contemporaneous with the Cloverly Formation. He originally referred it to Sauropelta as a possible new species, but it was never named. In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip animal to Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae. Armor plate Other recent, but undescribed, discoveries include a complete skull from the Cloverly of Montana and a huge fragmentary skeleton from the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah. These discoveries have been published only as abstracts for the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference, and may or may not prove to belong to S. edwardsorum or even Sauropelta when formally published. =Footprint discoveries= In 1932, Charles Mortram Sternberg reported the presence of the footprints of a large, four-footed dinosaur from Lower Cretaceous rocks in British Columbia, Canada. He described a new ichnogenus and species for these tracks, Tetrapodosaurus borealis, and attributed them to ceratopsians. However, in 1984 paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the British Columbian Tetrapodosaurus prints and argued that they were made by ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians. Specifically, Carpenter concluded that these were probably the footprints of Sauropelta. Five years later, large numbers of Tetrapodosaurus tracks were discovered at the Smoky River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta. This site is considered the most important ankylosaur track site in the world.McCrea, Richard T. 2000. Vertebrate palaeoichnology of the lower cretaceous (lower Albian) gates formation of Alberta. Paleoecology Restoration Sauropelta was one of the earliest known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers. While Sauropelta was an important part of the Cloverly herbivore guild, the most abundant herbivorous dinosaur of the time was the large ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The smaller ornithopod Zephyrosaurus, rare titanosaur sauropods, and an unknown type of ornithomimosaur also lived alongside Sauropelta. The dromaeosaurid theropod Deinonychus fed upon some of these herbivores, and the sheer number of Deinonychus teeth scattered throughout the formation are a testament to its abundance. Microvenator, a small basal oviraptorosaur, hunted smaller prey, while the apex predators of the Cloverly was the large allosauroid theropod Acrocanthosaurus. Lungfish, triconodont mammals, and several species of turtles lived in the Cloverly, while crocodilians prowled the rivers, lakes, and swamps, providing evidence of a year-round warm climate. The Late Jurassic fauna dominated by allosauroids, stegosaurs, and many varieties of huge sauropods gave way by Cloverly times to an Early Cretaceous fauna in which dromaeosaurs, ornithopods, and nodosaurs like Sauropelta were predominant. After the Cloverly ended, a large wave of Asian animals, including tyrannosaurids, ceratopsians, and ankylosaurids would disperse into western North America, forming the mixed fauna seen throughout the Late Cretaceous.

Life Born in New York City, he was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Yankees in 1948. His Major League debut was on April 18, 1954 for the Yankees. He wore uniform number 55 for the Yankees during his entire period on the team. He won 20 games (the first Yankee rookie to win 20 since 1910) and lost only 6 that year, with a 3.26 earned run average, and was voted American League Rookie of the Year, with 15 votes out of 24. He played in two World Series for the Yankees, in 1955 (against the Brooklyn Dodgers) and in 1957 (against the Milwaukee Braves). By 1957, because of arm troubles, he became an exclusive relief pitcher. He has been retroactively listed as leading the American League in saves in 1957 with 19. (At the time, saves were not a regularly calculated statistic.) Grim got the final out of the 1957 All-Star Game, being brought in from the bullpen with the American League leading 6‚Äì5 and getting pinch-hitter Gil Hodges on a game- ending fly out to left field. He also took the loss in Game 4 of the 1957 World Series when he allowed a walk-off home run to Milwaukee Braves third baseman Eddie Mathews. On June 15, 1958, Grim was traded, along with Harry Simpson, by the New York Yankees to the Kansas City Athletics for Duke Maas and Virgil Trucks. He had records of 7‚Äì6 and 6‚Äì10 for the Athletics the next two seasons. He played with three teams in 1960. On April 5, 1960, he was traded by Kansas City to the Cleveland Indians for Leo Kiely. On May 18, the Cincinnati Reds purchased his contract from Cleveland, and on July 29, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased his contract from Cincinnati. He spent all of 1961 at the Triple-A level in the Redbird organization. Grim was released by the Cardinals before the 1962 season, but on April 9, 1962 he was signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Athletics. His final MLB game was played on May 24, and the A's released him on May 31. He died in Shawnee, Kansas at age 66 after suffering a heart attack while throwing snowballs with neighborhood kids.Bob Grim, Pitcher, 66 See also * List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders References External links *Bob Grim's biographical information and statistics on the Baseball Almanac site * 1930 births 1996 deaths American League All-Stars Amsterdam Rugmakers players Baseball players from New York (state) Binghamton Triplets players Butler Yankees players Charleston Marlins players Cincinnati Reds players Cleveland Indians players Kansas City Athletics players Major League Baseball pitchers Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners New York Yankees players Norfolk Tars players Portland Beavers players St. Louis Cardinals players San Juan Marlins players Sportspeople from New York City ","title":"Bob Grim (baseball)"},{"id":"4298164","text":"Letkaliiteri Rutalahti is a village in the municipality of Joutsa in Western Finland.

Founded by Claude Charles Jackson in 1932.  History  Armstrong 426 combined amplifier and tuner from the mid-1960s Initially created to manufacture portable radios, during World War II their factory was used to manufacture radios, public address systems, and various electronic parts. After the war, they began to produce television sets, as well as long range radios for ships, but eventually ceased production of those lines to manufacture radios, amplifiers and tuners for home consumer use. In the 1950s when the high fidelity market began to take shape, the company name was changed to Armstrong Audio and they focused their marketing and manufacturing at becoming hi-fi specialists. During the 1960s and 1970s they were extremely successful, creating several durable radio models which are still in use by consumers today, but by the end of the 1970s their lease on their factory ran out and it was decided not to invest in a new one. The building was torn down and the owners redeveloped it. Using plans developed for a further radio model, some of the staff continued on as Armstrong Amplifiers, but due to a lack of capital and suitable manufacturing space, production did not last long. Today, what once was Armstrong Audio is now called Armstrong Hi-Fi and Video Services and is based in Walthamstow, and they provide maintenance contract to a number of retail stores. Armstrong 521 The Armstrong 521 was a stereo hi-fi amplifier from the Armstrong Audio company and was marketed as 2 x 25W amplifier. It employed germanium AL102 transistors in its output stages and these had a reputation for failure and are now unobtainable although it is possible, with modification to replace these with newer, silicon transistors. The amplifier was a single rail design and employed an electrolytic output capacitor in the output stage. The amplifier featured inputs for tape, tuner and MM gramophone and on the front panel had 4 rotary controls for volume, bass, treble and balance. Underneath these controls were a series of black push buttons which allowed control of the input sources as well as loudness, high pass filters, rumble filters and tape bypass. The amplifier was presented with an aluminium, silk-screened front panel with a teak case and a matte black rear panel. The amplifiers were marketed from the 1968‚Äì1972 when it was replaced by 600 series. Product reviews ;PCU25 Preamp/Control Unit + A20 Valve Power Amp * Gramophone, rev. by Philip G.

In 1930, the Swedish paleontologist Anders Birger Bohlin during the Swedish-Chinese expeditions of Sven Hedin discovered an ankylosaurian fossil near Tebch in Inner Mongolia.B. Bohlin, 1953, Fossil reptiles from Mongolia and Kansu. Reports from the Scientific Expedition to the North-western Provinces of China under Leadership of Dr. Sven Hedin. VI. Vertebrate Palaeontology 6. The Sino- Swedish Expedition Publications 37, 113 pp The type species Sauroplites scutiger was named and described by Bohlin in 1953. The generic name is derived from Greek sauros or saura, \\"lizard\\", and hoplites, \\"hoplite, armed foot soldier\\". The specific name is new Latin for \\"shield bearer\\", in reference to the body armour. The specimens were not given an inventory number and are today lost, though some casts are present in the American Museum of Natural History as specimen AMNH 2074. They were found in a layer of the Zhidan Group, probably dating from the Barremian to Aptian stages. The carcass had been deposited on its back and the bones had been eroded away, apart from some ribs and perhaps a piece of an ischium, leaving parts of the body armour in a largely articulated position. At first generally accepted as valid, even though a diagnosis had originally not been provided, Sauroplites was later often considered a nomen dubium because it is based on fragmentary material.Coombs, W.P., Jr. & T. Marya≈Ñska (1990), \\"Ankylosauria\\" in: D.B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, & H. Osm√≥lka (eds), The Dinosauria. University of California Press, pp. 456-483 Some believed it might actually be a specimen of another ankylosaur, Shamosaurus. However, in 2014 Victoria Megan Arbour discovered a clear unique trait, autapomorphy: the sacral or pelvic shield shows rosettes with a large central osteoderm surrounded by a single ring of smaller scutes. Other species have multiple or irregular rings. She concluded that Sauroplites was a valid taxon.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014, Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs. Ph.D thesis, University of Alberta The large central osteoderms of the rosettes are rather flat and have a diameter of ten centimetres. More to the front oval osteoderms, with an asymmetric low keel, cover the back, with a length of up to forty centimetres. Thirty centimetre osteoderms cover the sides. Bohlin placed Sauroplites in the Ankylosauridae. However, Arbour considered it possible that it was a member of the Nodosauridae in view of the possession of a sacral shield consisting of fused rosettes which is unknown with unequivocal ankylosaurids, even though nodosaurid remains from Asia are rare and contentious. In a cladistic analysis she performed, Sauroplites was recovered as a nodosaurid.

It is known from either the lower levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation or upper levels of the Oldman Formation (the location of the type specimen's quarry is uncertain) in the Late Cretaceous (latest middle Campanian stage, about 76.5 Ma ago) of Alberta, Canada. It contains two species, S. cutleri and S. thronus. Discovery S. cutleri holotype specimen NHMUK R5161 at Natural History Museum, London Scolosaurus was named by Franz Nopcsa von Fels≈ë-Szilv√°s in 1928, based on holotype NHMUK R.5161, a nearly complete specimen that preserves the entire skeleton except for the distal end of the tail, the right forelimb, the right hindlimb, and the skull. The rare preservation of osteoderms and skin impression are also present. The fossil skeleton was discovered by William Edmund Cutler, an independent fossil collector in 1914 at Quarry 80 of the Deadlodge Canyon locality. It was collected from the bottom of the Dinosaur Park Formation in fine-grained sandstone and fine-grained claystone sediments that were deposited during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 76.5 million years ago. The holotype specimen is housed in the collection of the Natural History Museum in London, England. In 2013, Arbour and Currie reassigned specimen MOR 433, upon which the genus Oohkotokia was based, to Scolosaurus. This specimen consists of a partial skull, both humeri, a caudal vertebra and several osteoderms and was recovered in the Upper Member of the Two Medicine Formation, in Montana, which has been dated at approximately 74 million years. The remains were collected in 1986-1987 in grey siltstone that was deposited during the Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period. The specimen is housed in the collection of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. The generic name Scolosaurus means \\"pointed stake lizard\\" and is derived from the Greek words skolos (œÉŒ∫·ø∂ŒªŒøœÇ) meaning \\"pointed stake\\", and sa√ªros (œÉŒ±œçœÅŒ±) meaning \\"lizard\\". The specific name, cutleri, honours its discoverer and the collector of the holotype, W. E. Cutler, who was seriously injured when the specimen fell on him as he was excavating it. Classification Skull of S. thronus holotype ROM 1930 In 1928, Nopcsa assigned the specimen to the family Ankylosauridae, and drew morphological comparisons with the fossil material known from Dyoplosaurus. In 1971, Walter Coombs concluded that there was only one species of ankylosaurid during the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous of North America. He synonymized the species Anodontosaurus lambei, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, and Scolosaurus cutleri with Euoplocephalus tutus but did not provide any justification for these synonymies.Coombs W. (1971) The Ankylosauridae. Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, New York, NY, 487 p. The synonymization of Scolosaurus cutleri and Euoplocephalus tutus was generally accepted and thus NHMUK R.5161 was assigned to E. tutus. However, a redescription of Scolosaurus published in 2013 in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences by Paul Penkalski and William T. Blows suggested that the genus is a valid taxon. They concluded that Scolosaurus can be distinguished from Euoplocephalus by the form of their cervical armour, the details of other armour and the structure of the forelimb. They also concluded that Scolosaurus and Dyoplosaurus are distinct, due to differences noted in the pelvis and armour. Due to its completeness, the holotype of Scolosaurus has formed the basis for most Euoplocephalus reconstructions since 1971; therefore, most images of Euoplocephalus actually depict Scolosaurus instead. A 2013 study found that the ankylosaurine Oohkotokia was indistinguishable from Scolosaurus, and was therefore considered a junior synonym. However, this synonymization is contentious as Oohkotokia was subsequently recognized as valid.Penkalski, P. 2014. A new ankylosaurid from the late Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana, USA. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 59(3): 617‚Äì634. Thus, much of the material illustrated as belonging to Scolosaurus may actually pertain to Oohkotokia. Skull MOR 433 of Oohkotokia, a possible junior synonym Referred S. cutleri skull, AMNH 5404 The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Victoria Arbour and Phillip J. Currie. The cladogram follows the biogeographical family tree provided by that study, which is a fusion of the study's 50% majority rule tree as well as the maximum agreement subtree. The study's 50% majority rule tree was a cladogram formed by a collection of clades, although it only included clades that appear in more than 50% of the family trees found during the analysis. The maximum agreement subtree is the cladogram that results from an algorithm which attempts to maximize the amount of taxa included in the result while also retaining the fundamental shape of all other trees in the sample. Some controversial taxa thus had to be omitted by the subtree in order for the resulting cladogram to fulfill the second requirement. The biogeographical tree (i.e. the following cladogram) is basically the 50% majority rule tree, except with some of the polytomies resolved according to the results of the maximum agreement subtree: The following cladogram is based on a 2017 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Victoria Arbour and David Evans. The cladogram depicts the majority rule (average result) of 10 most parsimonious trees, which each are considered to have the fewest evolutionary steps, thus being the most accurate under the principle of Occam's razor: Reconstructed skeleton based on S. thronus holotype specimen ROM 1930 Life restoration of Scolosaurus cutleri. Proportions based on Paul (2016) =Referred material= Referred skull USNM 11892 In 1874, G. M. Dawson excavated specimen USNM 7943 at the Milk River locality of the Frenchman Formation in Alberta. It was collected from terrestrial sediments that are considered to be from the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 70.6 to 66 million years old. The specimen consisted of a partial first cervical ring, which is part of the dinosaur's neck. In 2013, this material was assigned to Scolosaurus by Arbour and Curry who conducted a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the ankylosauridae. It is currently housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. In 1928, George F.

This is also housed at the Smithsonian Institution. Other referred specimens include FPDM V-31, NSM PV 20381 and TMP 2001.42.9. FPDM V-31 and TMP 2001.42.9 are both skulls, in various states of preservation. NSM PV 20381 includes a skull, dorsal vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, ribs, both scapulae, both ilia, partial ischia, and both femora, both tibiae and fibulae. =Distinguishing anatomical features= Referred skull, TMP 2001.42.9 Size of Scolosaurus compared to a human A differential diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Arbour and Currie (2013), Scolosaurus (including the Two Medicine material) can be distinguished from other ankylosaurines based on the following characteristics: * the squamosal horns are proportionately longer, are backswept, and have distinct apices (unlike Anodontosaurus lambei and Euoplocephalus tutus) * the presence of a small circular caputegula at the bases of the squamosal and quadratojugal bones (unlike Euoplocephalus tutus) * the postacetabular process of the ilium is proportionately longer (compared to Anodontosaurus lambei, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and Euoplocephalus tutus) * the presence of proportionately large circular medial osteoderms with low central prominences, and compressed, half-moon shaped lateral/distal osteoderms on the cervical half rings (unlike Anodontosaurus lambei and Euoplocephalus tutus) * the sacral ribs are laterally-directed (unlike Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus) * the osteoderms are conical, with centrally positioned apices on the lateral sides of the anterior portion of the tail (unlike Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus) * the tail club knob appears circular in dorsal view, unlike that of Anodontosaurus, which appears wider than it is long or that of Dyoplosaurus, which appears longer than it is wide * the presence of anteriorly-directed nares, and the absence of a continuous keel between the squamosal horn and the supraorbital bones (unlike Ankylosaurus magniventris) Paleoecology Depiction of the mega-herbivores in the Dinosaur Park Formation, Scolosaurus on the front right =Habitat= Argon- argon radiometric dating indicates that the Two Medicine Formation was deposited between 83.5 and 70.6 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, in what is now northwestern Montana. If Oohkotokia is the same as Scolosaurus it would mean that Scolosaurus existed for around 3 million years. The Two Medicine Formation correlates to the Belly River Group in southwest Alberta, and the Pakowki Formation eastward. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited by rivers and deltas between the western shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway and the eastward advancing margin of the Cordilleran Overthrust Belt. Since the mid-Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by this seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface of the water. However, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway, carrying sediment that formed the Two Medicine Formation and the Judith River Group. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, now preserved throughout the Western US and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale, which overlies the Two Medicine. Below this formation are the nearshore deposits of the Virgelle Sandstone. Lithologies, invertebrate faunas, and plant and pollen data support that the Two Medicine Formation was deposited in a seasonal, semi-arid climate with possible rainshadows from the Cordilleran highlands. This region experienced a long dry season and warm temperatures. The extensive red beds and caliche horizons of the upper Two Medicine are evidence of at least seasonally arid conditions. =Paleofauna= Skull of specimen AMNH 5405, Scolosaurus sp. Scolosaurus shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the duck-billed hadrosaurs Hypacrosaurus, Acristavus, Gryposaurus, Brachylophosaurus, Glishades, Prosaurolophus and Maiasaura, and the ankylosaur Edmontonia. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations. Oviraptorosaurs like Caenagnathus and Chirostenotes may have preyed upon the ornithopod Orodromeus. A large variety of ceratopsians coexisted in this region, which included Achelousaurus, Brachyceratops, Cerasinops, Einiosaurus, Prenoceratops and Rubeosaurus. Carnivores included an unnamed troodontid, possibly Stenonychosaurus, the dromaeosaurs Bambiraptor and Saurornitholestes, and the large tyrannosaurids Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.\\"3.11 Montana, United States; 2. Lower Two Medicine Formation,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). The excellent vertebrate fossil record of Two Medicine and Judith River rocks resulted from a combination of abundant animal life, periodic natural disasters, and the deposition of large amounts of sediment. Many types of freshwater and estuarine fish are represented, including sharks, rays, sturgeons, gars and others. This region preserves the remains of many aquatic amphibians and reptiles, including bivalves, gastropods, frogs, salamanders, turtles, Champsosaurus and crocodilians. Terrestrial lizards, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards have also been discovered. Pterosaurs like Montanazhdarcho and Piksi as well as birds like Apatornis and Avisaurus flew overhead. Several varieties of mammals, such as the multituberculate Cimexomys coexisted with dinosaurs in the Two Medicine Formation and the various other formations that make up the Judith River wedge. Fossilized eggs belonging to a dromaeosaur have been recovered here. When water was plentiful, the region could support a great deal of plant and animal life, but periodic droughts often resulted in mass mortality.

Dipsacus sylvestris, is a species of flowering plant known by the common names wild teasel or fuller's teasel, although the latter name is usually applied to the cultivated species Dipsacus sativus. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is known in the Americas, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. It forms large monocultures (displacing other species) in areas it invades that have favorable climates and none of its biological control species. The inflorescence is a cylindrical array of lavender flowers which dries to a cone of spine-tipped hard bracts. It may be 10 centimeters long. D. fullonum is identifiable in the 6th-century Vienna Dioscurides, fol. 99 It is a herbaceous biennial plant (rarely a short- lived perennial plant) growing to tall. Two moths useful for biological control were tested in Slovakia in 2003-2004 (following the identification of seven insects associated with the plant and their consideration), including the monophagous Endothenia gentianaeana. Although Endothenia gentianaeana was able to be reared in high numbers and its presence was found in nearly 100% of teasel plants surveyed in Slovakia, and despite the high level of damage caused by the second moth, Cochylis roseana (which was not targeted by local parasitic wasps frequently as was Endothenia gentianaeana), the USDA has not approved either of these moths for introduction as of February 2018. Instead, the USDA continues to suggest the use of herbicidal chemicals. Description youngish leaf low to the ground, before flower stem development The genus name is derived from the word for thirst and refers to the cup-like formation made where sessile leaves merge at the stem. Rain water can collect in this receptacle; this may perform the function of preventing sap-sucking insects such as aphids from climbing the stem. A recent experiment has shown that adding dead insects to these cups increases the seedset of teasels (but not their height), implying partial carnivory. The leaf shape is lanceolate, long and broad, with a row of small spines on the underside of the midrib. Teasels are easily identified with their prickly stem and leaves, and the inflorescence of purple, dark pink or lavender flowers that form a head on the end of the stem(s). The inflorescence is ovoid, long and broad, with a basal whorl of spiny bracts. The first flowers begin opening in a belt around the middle of the spherical or oval flowerhead, and then open sequentially toward the top and bottom, forming two narrow belts as the flowering progresses. The dried head persists afterwards, with the small () seeds maturing in mid autumn. Wildlife interaction The seeds are an important winter food resource for some birds, notably the European goldfinch. Teasels are often grown in gardens and encouraged on some nature reserves to attract them. Cultivation and uses The fuller's teasel (the cultivar group Dipsacus fullonum Sativus Group; syn. D. sativus) was formerly widely used in textile processing, providing a natural comb for cleaning, aligning and raising the nap on fabrics, particularly wool.\\"Teasel.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. It differs from the wild type in having stouter, somewhat recurved spines on the seed heads. The dried flower heads were attached to spindles, wheels, or cylinders, sometimes called teasel frames, to raise the nap on fabrics (that is, to tease the fibres). By the 20th century, teasels were largely replaced by metal cards, which could be made uniform and do not require constant replacement as the teasel heads wear. However, some people who weave wool still prefer to use teasels for raising the nap, claiming that the result is better; in particular, if a teasel meets serious resistance in the fabric, it will break, whereas a metal tool would rip the cloth. Teasels are also occasionally grown as ornamental plants, and the dried heads are used in floristry. Teasels have been naturalised in many regions away from their native range, partly due to the import of fuller's teasel for textile processing, and partly by the seed being a contaminant mixed with crop seeds.

Life  Bruce Beehler graduated from Williams College and received his Masters and PhD studying the behavioral ecology of the birds-of-paradise at Princeton University. He has been an authority on New Guinea birds for several decades, having authored or co-authored several major works on the biodiversity this, the largest tropical island, including The Birds of Paradise (1998), The Birds of New Guinea (1986, 2014) and the two-volume Ecology of Papua (2007). To the general public, Beehler is best known for having co-led a widely published rapid assessment survey on biological diversity in 2005 to the Foja Mountains, Papua, where he, together with an international team of 11 scientists, the majority from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), made a number of scientific discoveries. The findings on this survey expanded on previous research conducted in the region by Dr. Jared Diamond in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Beehler and colleagues, however, returned with the first ever photographs of two species of birds, the bronze parotia (Parotia berlepschi) and the golden-fronted bowerbird (Amblyornis flavifrons), that previously were known only from a few specimens. Additionally, a previously unknown species of honeyeater was discovered, it being scientifically described in 2007 as the wattled smoky honeyeater (Melipotes carolae). The specific epithet, carolae, commemorates Carol Beehler, the wife of Bruce Beehler. Together with a team from 60 Minutes, Beehler returned to the Foja Mountains in 2007, resulting in the first ever filming of several of the species discovered in 2005, as well as encounters with an undescribed giant rat (Mallomys sp.) and a tiny pygmy possum (Cercartetus sp.).

Gameplay The tuition is through spoken commands and dictated words for the player to spell. The player spells the words by typing on the keyboard and they are simultaneously displayed on the screen. The spoken commands and words are delivered in American English, through the computer audio output. Ten lists of words are provided for spelling, in graduated difficulty. You can also make custom lists. A list is selected at the start of each game. It features a multilevel cave which the player's joystick guided character (selection of boy or girl) explores with the objective of finding a number of crystals in order to exit the dungeon. The character uses a flashlight to illuminate his/her way around the dungeon to find the crystals, which are attached to the dungeon wall in random locations. The cave features a number of obstacles: crevasses to fall or jump down a level, rocks to trip over, puddles to slip and fall in, and scorpions and snakes to sting you. Your character can jump over these using a joystick button. If you fall or get stung, you have to use one of the 5 bandaids you started with. There are ladders to go up and down levels safely.

Discovery and naming In 1977, a Soviet-Mongolian expedition discovered the skeleton of an unknown ankylosaurian at the Chamrin-Us site in Dornogovi Province. This was the first discovery of an ankylosaur in the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia.T.A. Tumanova, 1983, \\"Pervyy ankilozavr iz nizhnego mela Mongolii\\", In: L.P. Tatarinov, R. Barsbold, E.

Trudy Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya 24: 110-118 In 1983, Tatyana Tumanova named and described the type species Shamosaurus scutatus. The generic name is derived from Mandarin sha mo, \\"sand desert\\", the Chinese name for the Gobi. The specific name means \\"protected by a shield\\" in Latin, a reference to the body armour. Shamosaurus is known from the holotype PIN N 3779/2, collected from the Dzunbain Formation, equivalent to the Khukhtekskaya Formation and dating from the Aptian-Albian, about 115 million years old. It consists of a complete skull, lower jaws and partial postcranial skeleton with armor. Only the skull was described in 1983. Later the specimens PIN 3779/1, a skull piece, and PIN 3101, a lower jaw, were referred. The fossils are part of the collection of the Palaeontological Institute at Moscow. The holotype skull is exhibited there, together with two cervical halfrings. Description Shamosaurus was a medium-sized ankylosaurian. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its body length at 5 metres (16 ft) , its weight at 2 tonnes (2.2 short tons).Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 230 In 2012 Holtz gave a higher estimation of 7 meters (23 ft). In 2014, Victoria Megan Arbour gave a revised list of distinguishing traits. The osteoderms on the skull roof are not very pronounced nor separated as distinctive caputegulae, head tiles. The squamosal horns on the rear skull corners are short and slightly rounded. The quadratojugal horn on the cheek has its apex in the middle. The rear rim of the skull roof has no clear (nuchal) processes.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014. Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs. Ph.D thesis, University of Alberta Shamosaurus scutatus shares many cranial similarities with Gobisaurus domoculus, including a rounded squamosal, large elliptical orbital fenestrae (oval eye sockets) and oval external nares (nostrils), a deltoid dorsal profile with a narrow rostrum (the snout is tongue-shaped and narrow in top view), quadratojugal protuberances (cheek horns), and caudolaterally directed paroccipital processes (extensions of the rear skull obliquely pointing to behind and sideways). But the two taxa may be distinguished by differences in the length of the maxillary tooth row (40% instead of 26,7% of total skull length), an unfused basipterygoid-pterygoid process in Gobisaurus, the presence of an elongate vomerine premaxillary process in Gobisaurus, and the presence of cranial sculpting in Shamosaurus, but not in Gobisaurus.Vickaryous M.K., Marya≈Ñska T., Weishampel D.B., 2004, \\"Ankylosauria\\". Chapter 17 in: Weishampel D.B., Dodson P., Osm√≥lska H., editors. The Dinosauria. 2nd ed. Berkeley (CA): University of California Press. p. 363‚Äì392 The last difference was denied by Arbour who concluded that the degree of sculpting was roughly the same. Shamosaurus had a rather flat skull. The upper beak was sharp and obliquely appending to the front. The beak lacked any teeth. The jaw joint was located far behind the level of the eye socket. The occipital condyle, and with it the entire head, was obliquely directed to below. A secondary palate was present. The armour of Shamosaurus contained two cervical halfrings with six segments each, protecting the neck. Also keeled osteoderms and flat oval scutes were present. Phylogeny Tumanova placed Shamosaurus in the Ankylosauridae. She also named a Shamosaurinae, a group of basal ankylosaurids. In 2014, Arbour recovered an evolutionary tree in which Shamosaurus was the sister species of Gobisaurus. See also * Timeline of ankylosaur research Notes References *Matthew K.

Jung grew up in Philadelphia and has Chinese ancestry. While with Mountain Brothers, he became known for using a combination of programmed and live instruments in his work, as opposed to sampling the work of others. Since the disbanding of the Mountain Brothers, CHOPS has worked primarily as a producer, with his most high-profile piece being the critically acclaimed 2011 video for Lonely Island entitled \\"The Creep.\\" Early life Chops and his family never stayed in a certain location for a long time. They were constantly moving from place to place which caused Chops to have short term relationships. Though he did not have long time relationships with his friends he did share a common interest with his brother; making music. Chops passion for making beats began with his friend from high school. His friend took to school a device that transformed Chop‚Äôs life forever. It was a drum machine and Chops began to copy beats from his favorite song, ‚ÄúWalk this way‚Äù by Run DMC. Ever since Chops got his hands on that device he couldn‚Äôt stop, making beats was his life. Since his family was constantly on the move he had one thing that wouldn‚Äôt change; music, so his mother bought him an electric keyboard and his brother a guitar. Chops always was supported by his family; his mother and brother. ‚ÄúMy brother has a band and I do mostly key.‚Äù Chops enrolled in many music courses while attending Penn State but did not major in music. His parents did not want him to major in music because they thought it was not a stable career.‚ÄúA-Profiler Interview: Music Producer CHOPS. Online video clip. YouTube, 21 October 2013. Web. 10 November 2015. Strength in Numbers After the Mountain Brothers went their own ways Chops still produced music. Chops‚Äô passion is and always will be music so he decided to continue to pursue it. Chops became a father and started to question how he can contribute to the world in order for it to better for his daughter; societal norms. Which is what lead to Chops‚Äô creation of the album; Strength in Numbers, which consists of a collaboration with talented Asian American artists and himself. Strength in Numbers was completed over a period of two years; started in 2011. Chops wanted this album to be a mixture with himself (producer) and artists to create a great album composed of pure Asian American artists that had great talent. The birth of this album was because Chops wanted people to dismantle the stereotypes and let the music speak for itself instead of the way the artists‚Äô looks. Chops as other Asian American artists have been prejudged that they are not capable of creating great music because of their ethnicity. Mainstream media does not have many Asian American rappers so Chops believes that this album is a way for everybody to listen that Asian Americans; as any other race, has the talent and should be acknowledged. Chops album Strength in Numbers consists with over thirty artists. When Chops was is in the Mountain Brothers; they would step on stage and everybody would assume their music would not be good, but after they performed everybody was amazed of their talents. ‚ÄúI remember this one guy connected with a big label that said, ‚ÄòYou know what ya should do?

Isotretinoin is a prescription medication that is highly effective in treating severe acne and moderate acne that doesn't respond to other treatments, however carries a high risk of causing severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy (see Teratogenicity of isoretinoin). The goals of the iPLEDGE REMS (risk evaluation and mitigation strategy) Program are to prevent fetal exposure to isotretinoin and to inform prescribers, pharmacists, and patients about isotretinoin's serious risks and safe-use conditions. The program was designed by the Isotretinoin Product Manufacturers Group (IPMG) and its chosen vendor, Covance, under the direction of the FDA. As of March 1, 2006, iPLEDGE patients, their doctors and their pharmacists are required by the FDA to register and use a web site in order to receive, prescribe or dispense this medication. The program has reduced exposure of pregnant women to the drug, and has also been criticized for being overly complicated.  Process  Once a doctor decides a patient is a candidate for isotretinoin, they will counsel the patient to ensure the patient understands the drug and the potential side effects. Once the patient signs the necessary paperwork, their doctor will give them a patient ID number and ID card, as well as other program educational materials. After they have been registered in iPLEDGE by their doctor, they will receive their password in the mail after 5‚Äì10 business days. Patients are classified either as females of child-bearing potential (FCBPs), females not of child-bearing potential (FnCBPs), or males. FCBPs are required to pick and use two birth control methods (abstinence included), and must take doctor-administered pregnancy tests in two consecutive months. After the second (confirmatory) negative pregnancy test, the FCBP must also take an online comprehension test to ensure she understands the requirements of the Program. Once those two items are complete, the FCBP is authorized to receive drug at an authorized pharmacy. From the date of the second (confirmatory) negative pregnancy test, an FCBP has seven days to pick up her prescription. FCBPs must see their doctor and take a pregnancy test in each subsequent month in order to get another prescription for the next 30 days. Males and FnCBPs must see their doctor every month, but don't have to take the pregnancy or comprehension tests. They have 30 days from the date of their office visit to pick up their prescriptions. After that point they have to see their doctor for another 30-day prescription. Before dispensing isotretinoin, the pharmacist must check the iPLEDGE Program website to ensure the patient is authorized to receive the drug. Isotretinoin may only be dispensed at authorized US pharmacies that are registered with the iPLEDGE Program, and FDA has taken action against Canadian and internet pharmacies which dispense isotretinoin outside of the iPLEDGE Program. Patients who acquire and consume isotretinoin without the care of a prescriber are putting themselves in jeopardy. The typical course of isotretinoin treatment will last 4‚Äì5 months, and is generally considered to be an option when nothing else has worked.  Background and history  Some dermatologists have praised isotretinoin for its ability to treat severe acne, with current research calling it \\"a drug of choice\\" with \\"immense promise ‚Ä¶ in reducing dermal irritation and increasing the therapeutic performance, thus resulting in an efficacious and patient-compliant formulation\\". However, there have also been many reports and studies criticizing the negative side effects of isotretinoin have been published over the years. The author of a 2002 paper from Harvard Law School wrote: \\"Accutane also has the potential to destroy lives. Accutane is an extremely dangerous teratogen: It can cause severe birth defects when taken during pregnancy. About one quarter of babies born who have been exposed to Accutane during gestation have major congenital deformities. Those babies born without major malformations frequently develop severe learning disabilities. A whole segment of Accutane babies do not even survive pregnancy: 40% are spontaneously miscarried.\\" The author goes on to compare Accutane to Thalidomide. The iPLEDGE Program was instituted as a replacement for the failed SMART program (System to Manage Accutane Related Teratogenicity).WebMD Medical News: \\"FDA OKs Tighter Controls for Accutane.\\" News release, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Instituted in April 2002, SMART aimed to eliminate isotretinoin-induced birth defects by preventing pregnant women from being prescribed or exposed to the drug. The program mandated two consecutive negative pregnancy tests, birth defect risk counseling and a pledge to use two forms of contraception when engaging in intercourse for all women of childbearing age seeking an isotretinoin prescription. A voluntary registration program called The Accutane Survey was also established. However, no effort was made to verify the compliance of doctors and pharmacists, only a small percentage of women registered in the survey, and isotretinoin's reputation as an acne wonder drug continued to fuel demand for new prescriptions, an increasing number of which were being written and dispensed for relatively minor cases of acne vulgaris without proper screening, supervision or evidence that less risky medications had first been attempted. = Failure of the previous system = In 2003, a first-year review of SMART compliance conducted by the pharmaceutical industry revealed that the number of pregnant women prescribed isotretinoin actually increased by hundreds of documented cases over the previous year, before the program was instituted. Of these cases, the majority of women underwent abortions‚Äîeither spontaneous or elective‚Äîwith a handful of children reported to be born with typical isotretinoin-induced birth defects. When surveyed, many pregnant women reported that their physicians had attempted to downplay the risks of isotretinoin or violated the standards in other ways, such as failing to inform women they needed to use two forms of birth control or allowing them to substitute a single, less-accurate urine pregnancy test conducted in the doctor's office for the two laboratory-conducted blood pregnancy tests mandated by SMART. The FDA also concluded that, considering the voluntary nature of the reporting program and lack of mandatory record-keeping, the actual number of pregnant women affected was likely far higher than the reported number.WebMD Medical News: \\"FDA Panel Urges Stricter Acne Drug Tracking; Women Still Having Risky Pregnancies While Taking Accutane\\", Feb 27, 2004 = Mandatory reporting and verification = The report led to SMART being dismissed as \\"a total failure\\", with the FDA quickly moving to halt the downward slide with a stricter mandatory registry system to document and verify all isotretinoin prescriptions written or dispensed to childbearing-age women in the United States.WebMD Medical News: \\"Accutane's Pregnancy Risk: Are Women Aware?\\" Miranda Hitti. Oct. 14 This was a feature originally included in the plan for SMART recommended by the original FDA advisory panel and wholeheartedly endorsed by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, but removed due to concerns that political opposition from lobbying groups would delay the program's implementation. Although eventually resolved, the older concerns proved valid in 2003 when the launch of iPLEDGE was held up for three years while objections from women's rights, patient's rights, physician's rights and pro-choice lobbyists were debated in committee. The iPLEDGE program was put into place a group formed by the companies that manufactured the drug at the time ‚Äì Roche, Mylan, Barr, and Ranbaxy ‚Äì called the Isotretinoin Products Manufacturing Group (IPMG); they are responsible for iPLEDGE and they hired Covance to manage it. The program launched on March 1, 2006, at the beginning of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. In the U.S., around 2000 women became pregnant while taking the drug between 1982 and 2000, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. About 160 babies with birth defects were born. After the FDA put the more strict iPLEDGE program in place for the companies marketing the drug in the US, in 2011, 155 pregnancies occurred among 129,544 women of childbearing potential taking isotrentinoin (0.12%).  Criticisms  Criticisms of the iPLEDGE program include the following: = Difficulty of compliance = Due to the nature of restricted distribution programs in general, and ETASU REMS programs specifically, stakeholder burden has always been balanced against control and compliance. When the Program launched in March 2006, there were many complaints about how difficult it was to use the system. Launch and pre-launch difficulties were common with the system jointly built by the drug manufacturers with the assistance of Covance, Inc, and approved by the FDA. Glitches with the website and long hold times were rampant at the time, and became a focus of physician and patient ire. Physicians have continued to be concerned that this very effective drug is made difficult to obtain due to a relatively small proportion of potential birth defects. Though prescriber and pharmacy populations have become more familiar with the requirements of the iPLEDGE Program over the years, and some of the initial issues with the system have subsided, the nature of the restrictive distribution program continues to cause inconvenience, added expenses, and interruptions in the course of treatment. For example, if there is a problem with the data a patient or prescriber enters, the patient may be locked out of the system, unable to obtain the drug, for that 30-day cycle. Additionally, if a patient misses her 7-day prescription pick-up window, the patient must return to the prescriber for another pregnancy test before being able to get the drug again. This return visit to the doctor, of course, can be inconvenient and costly. To minimize the number of necessary visits to the doctor, a patient would want to schedule their appointment near the end of a 30-day period, but then must pick up the medicine quickly to avoid being blocked out of the system and running out of the medication. In 2008, dermatologist Robert Greenburg said \\"For a program to be so inflexible that it doesn't take into consideration the holiday or a patient's extenuating circumstances is such an impediment. It happens often that the 30-day window runs into the weekend when offices are closed. This [iPLEDGE] isn't the way things are done in the real world.\\" \\"Why is iPLEDGE so complicated? Clearly, it's for political reasons,\\" said Greenberg, citing political opposition to abortion and his impression that morality has guided the policy development more than medical science and evidence of effectiveness. = Privacy intrusion = Some patients feel that the requirements to take monthly pregnancy tests and enter information about contraceptive choices constitute an unreasonable intrusion, and feel that's too high a price to pay to gain access to this drug. Additionally, maintenance of a pregnancy registry is part of the Program, though participation in the registry is voluntary for those patients who might've become pregnant. Requirements of the program also mandate, per FDA requirements, monthly pregnancy tests for women who may become pregnant. The website does include a privacy statement, which discusses what information is collected, how it is used, and where questions can be directed. = Required participation of males and non-child bearing females = The iPLEDGE Program requires the participation of both males and FnCBPs, and this has been a subject of criticism over the course of the program's lifetime. Dermatologist Ned Ryan said \\"They [the FDA and drug manufacturers] want a wide net, understandably. But this is completely over the top.\\" Participation is required to ensure that these two groups understand the basic requirements, as sharing of medication with women who can get pregnant is a real concern. Though they must be part of the iPLEDGE Program, requirements for males and FnCBPs are more lenient than those for FCBPs. Males and FnCBPs do not need to take either pregnancy or comprehension tests on a monthly basis, and their prescription window is 30 days from the date of the office visit, rather than seven days as it is with FCBPs. = Disproportionate impact on minorities and lower socioeconomic status groups = A 2019 study of patients at two academic institutions in Boston, Massachusetts demonstrated differences in delayed starting, interruption, and early termination of isotretinoin treatment course across race. Non-white patients were more likely than white patients to experience medication interruptions and early terminations and were more likely to achieve sub-optimal doses of isotretinoin. The most common cited reasons for delays were logistics associated with the iPLEDGE system, including computer issues, missed pick-up windows, and missed/delayed appointments/tests.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. = Criticisms of the iPLEDGE website and phone system = Some criticisms of the iPLEDGE website include that the website does not clearly identify who administers the site, despite being a mandatory program that requires the submission of private information about medical patients. The terms of use and legal disclaimer section of the site do not clearly identify the legal entity running the program or describe how the private information of the patients is secured. The terms of use for the site is phrased as a contract between \\"you\\" and \\"the sponsors of the Site\\" (which it defines as synonymous with \\"iPLEDGE\\"), without clearly saying who \\"the sponsors of the Site\\" includes. The program was mandated by the FDA despite criticism from practicing medical doctors that its cumbersome nature and strict deadlines can make the drug unavailable to deserving patients.Life After iPLEDGE, The Dermatologist, September 4, 2008. In practice, the website has presented many problems to physicians; once information is entered, it can be difficult or impossible to change or correct it. If there is an error, the patient can be locked out for 30 days without being able to receive the medication. Problems are common and take days to correct. Technical assistance by phone is available via a toll free number, but trying to correct problems using the phone system can be difficult and time-consuming. Cathy Boeck, a past president of the Dermatology Nurses Association, said \\"Nurses are having the same frustrations as doctors regarding difficulties of getting the drug to patients and patients' complaints. It has a huge impact on resources if someone is waiting on hold with iPLEDGE and is also taking calls from patients who are upset and frustrated. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve heard from members.\\" Although the goal of the program is to prevent pregnancies of women who take the drug, male patients must also participate in anti-pregnancy restrictions, primarily due to fears that male isotretinoin users might share their prescriptions with females without their physicians' knowledge. There has been no link to birth defects from Accutane associated with males using the drug, though male sexual dysfunction has been suggested by one study. As this has not been conclusively proven, this is not acknowledged as a side effect in the official literature accompanying the medication.

Like the avian placement of Protoavis, the ornithomimosaur placement of Shuvosaurus was greeted with skepticism by others, and in their 1995 monograph on Late Triassic tetrapods from the American Southwest, Robert Long and Philip Murry considered Shuvosaurus to be possibly the same species as their new taxon Chatterjeea, which was based on 10 postcranial skeletons that had been previously referred to the rauisuchid Postosuchus by Chatterjee (1985), noting that the Shuvosaurus and the Chatterjeea material didn't overlap in terms of available material.Long and Murry, 1995.

For his part, Rauhut (1997, 2000, 2003) agreed with Long and Murry (1995) in questioning the ornithomimosaur placement of Shuvosaurus but classified it as a basal theropod.Rauhut, O. W. M.

Big Bang chronicles the history and development of the Big Bang model of the universe, from the ancient Greek scientists who first measured the distance to the sun to the 20th century detection of the cosmic radiation still echoing the dawn of time. The book discusses how different theories of the universe evolved, along with a personal look at the people involved.  Before Big Bang theories  The book takes up how the inaccuracies of the theories of Copernicus and Galileo lead them to be dismissed. Copernicus and Galileo used false arguments to persuade people that the Earth went in circles around the Sun, and that the Sun was the center of the universe. Both these statements were alien to the public at the time, and are still alien to a modern public. Only the finally mathematically correct interpretation of Johannes Kepler made the theories accepted, within a single generation. As Singh points out, the old generation must die before a new theory can be accepted.  The Big Bang theory evolves  In parallel to the evolution of the Big Bang theory, the book tells the personal stories of the people who played a part in advancing it, both by hypothesis and by experiment. These include Albert Einstein, for his General Relativity, Alexander Alexandrovich Friedman for first discovering that this theory led to an expanding universe, Georges Lema√Ætre who concluded independently of Friedman discovered an expanding universe, and then that the theory must lead to an initial event of creation, which is the Big Bang theory we know today, Edwin Hubble for observing that the universe expanded, thereby confirming Friedman and Lema√Ætre, George Gamow, Ralph Asher Alpher, Robert Herman, Martin Ryle, Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, among many others. Another theme of the book is the scientific method itself: how serendipity, curiosity, theory and observation come together to expand our understanding of the world. One of the most interesting points in the book is how Einstein initially dismissed the theory out of hand. Such was his authority in the scientific community that none dared oppose him, thereby stifling research in this area for many years. However, when Hubble confirmed the theory, Einstein was quick to endorse both Lema√Ætre and his theories.

Biography Labrousse established a historical model centered on three nodes‚Äîeconomic, social and cultural‚Äîinventing the quantitative history sometimes now called \\"cliometrics\\". Eschewing biographies and the narrative accounts of individual witnesses, which have provided the backbone of traditional historiography, he applied statistical methods and influenced a whole generation. Fernand Braudel said that if it were not for Labrousse, \\"historians would never have set to work as willingly as they did on the study of wages and prices\\".Fernand Braudel, The Wheels of Commerce 1982, vol. II in Civilization and Capitalism p 343 Labrousse's prominence was also a result of his post at the Sorbonne, where he supervised a generation of French post- doctoral th√®ses and his organizational skills from the 1950s onwards in leading team research efforts that were models of the historian's craft.Points made by Mark Potter, introducing the section on Labrousse in Philip Daileader, Philip Whalen, eds. French Historians 1900-2000: New Historical Writing in Twentieth-Century France 2010:360-70. His first great work was his Esquisse du mouvement des prix et des revenus en France au XVIIIe si√®cle (\\"Sketch of the movement of prices and revenues in France during the 18th century\\", 1932), the result of his law dissertation under the direction of Albert Aftalion.Noted by Potter 2010. It synthesizes several data series on prices of food and manufactures, on incomes, including the inflationary rise in land rents, and on lagging wages over the course of the century, as part of the interplay between economic trends and class frictions that led ultimately to revolution. Labrousse's own work concentrated on eighteenth and nineteenth-century France, but his constant concern for working methods that could be expanded beyond his subjects at hand to inspect other parts of the early modern world and the world that was transformed by the Industrial Revolution, is exemplified in the range of studies in the hommage of his pupils and their pupils that was edited by Braudel and others, Conjoncture √©conomique, structures sociales (Paris 1974). The \\"Labrousse model\\" of the subsistence crisis in the preindustrial grain-and-textiles economy of France and its effect in precipitating the French Revolution, detailed in the second of his two magisterial works, La Crise de l‚Äô√©conomie fran√ßaise (1943), which Fernand Braudel called \\"the greatest work of history to have appeared in France in the course of the last twenty-five years.\\" Braudel, \\"Histoire et Science Sociale: La Longue Dur√©e\\" (1958) Annales E.S.C. 13.4 (October‚ÄìDecember 1958:725-753), quoted by Potter 2010. Labrousse's social and economic rendering of the Revolution is summarized in the hundred pages he contributed to Le XVIIIe Siecle: Revolution Intellectuelle, Technique et Politique (1715-1815) with Roland Mousnier and Marc Bouloiseau (Paris: PUF) 1953). has especially wide application, though his paradigm has been adjusted by subsequent studies that have reintroduced complexities. Labrousse, whose early background was in progressive political activism, was not strictly a member of the Annales School of historians, who were too influenced by the preconceptions of Marxist historiography to satisfy him, but he collaborated in their efforts to create a new human history centered in historical demography. In 1948 he chaired a celebrated conference inquiring into \\"how revolutions are born,\\" focusing on the French revolutions of 1789, 1830 and 1848, and applying to them his social, economic and political methodology. In 1979 he received the Balzan Prize for History (ex aequo with Giuseppe Tucci). Labrousse had begun as a student of Fran√ßois Simiand.

Michigan OSHA is an agency within the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and operates under a formal state-plan agreement with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). MIOSHA is responsible for assuring safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women in Michigan. The agency administers the MIOSH Act, Act 154 of 1974, as amended. Safe and healthy work environments are achieved through a combination of enforcement, outreach, and collaborative partnerships. The agency also licenses asbestos contractors and certifies asbestos workers. The agency administers the MIOSHA program through an organization composed of the Construction Safety and Health Division, the General Industry Safety and Health Division, the Consultation Education and Training Division, the MIOSHA Appeals Division, the Management and Technical Services Division, and program administration. MIOSHA applies to all public and private sector places of employment in the state, with the exception of federal employees, the United States Postal Service, domestic employment, maritime, and mining, which are subject to the federal OSHA jurisdiction. History The Michigan Legislature created the modern Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act, Public Act 154 of 1974, in order to better prevent workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities in Michigan by: setting and enforcing occupational safety and health standards; promoting safety and health training and education; and working with partners to develop innovative programs to prevent workplace hazards. P.A. 154 went into effect for private sector employers on January 1, 1975 and for public sector employers on July 1, 1975. The MIOSH Act established the General Industry Safety Standards Commission, the Construction Safety Standards Commission, and the Occupational Health Commission. The commissions are responsible for developing standards in consultation with advisory committees whose members represent the major interests affected by the proposed standard. The standards are intended to protect the health and safety of Michigan's employees. MIOSHA was administered by the Michigan Department of Public Health, Occupational Health Division and the Michigan Department of Labor, Bureau of Safety and Regulation until 1996 when Governor John Engler issued Executive Order 1996-1 which transferred occupational health responsibilities to the Bureau of Safety and Regulation. In September 2003, Governor Jennifer M. Granholm signed Executive Order 2003-14 creating the Department of Labor and Economic Growth. The department was created by renaming the Department of Consumer and Industry Services and merging many Department of Career Development functions into the new department along with several other key programs from other departments. On December 8, 2003, the MIOSHA program reorganized its operational structure by creating the Management & Technical Services Division and combining enforcement divisions. The General Industry Safety Division, Construction Safety Division and the Occupational Health Division became the General Industry Safety & Health Division and the Construction Safety and Health Division. The MIOSHA Information Division became the Management Information Systems Section and the MIOSHA Standards Division became the MIOSHA Standards Section. Both are administered by the Management & Technical Services Division. The Employee Discrimination Division became the Employee Discrimination Section and is administered by the General Industry Safety and Health Division. The asbestos program is administered by the Construction Safety and Health Division. In addition, the program name changed from the Bureau of Safety and Regulation to the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA). On December 28, 2008, Governor Jennifer M. Granholm signed Executive Order 2008-20 creating the Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth. The department was created by renaming the Department of Labor and Economic Growth and ensuring efficient administration and effectiveness of government. Effective April 24, 2011, Governor Rick Snyder signed Executive Order 2011-4 creating the Department of Licensing & Regulatory Affairs. The department was created by renaming the Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth and reorganizing functions among state departments to ensure efficient administration. Included in this executive order, the Wage & Hour Division joined the Michigan Occupational Safety & Health Administration (MIOSHA). Programs and Services Enforcement Programs MIOSHA has two enforcement divisions: the General Industry Safety and Health Division and the Construction Safety and Health Division. The General Industry Safety and Health Division conducts safety and health inspections and investigations in all places of employment within the state of Michigan except those operations and activities covered by the Construction Safety and Health Division. This includes both private employers and all levels of public sector employers except facilities of the federal government. The division responds to complaints from employees or their representatives, investigates accidents including fatalities and catastrophes, and responds to referrals of unsafe conditions from other government agencies. In addition, the division conducts unannounced inspections at facilities throughout the state in accordance with current priority inspection guidelines. Citations, some with proposed penalties, may be issued to employers as a result of these inspections or investigations. Extensive tracking is done to ensure that the employers make the appropriate corrections to ensure the safety and health of their employees. The Construction Safety and Health Division primarily conducts inspections to enforce occupational safety and health standards in the construction industry, and oversees licensing of asbestos abatement contractors and accreditation of asbestos workers. Enforcement of standards includes: inspection and hazard identification, issuance of citations for violations, and penalty assessment, if any. Types of inspections include: accidents (fatal and non-fatal), employee complaints, general scheduled, referrals, and follow-up. The division enforces safety and health standards in construction workplaces defined in the MIOSH Act as work activity designated in major groups 15, 16, and 17, of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual or code 23 of the North American Industry Classification System. All construction types are inspected including projects such as: road and bridge projects; sewer, water, gas, and electric utility lines; power plants; waste and water treatment plants; high rise construction; factory and other building additions; communication and power transmission towers; and single family homes. Voluntary and Cooperative Programs MIOSHA's Consultation Education and Training Division educates employers and employees in safety and health awareness. Informal Conferences and Appeals The MIOSHA Appeals Division provides employers, employees and the agency with services for resolution of contested MIOSHA cases. The MIOSH Act provides for a two-step appeal process for employers and/or employees to appeal any citations issued by the enforcement divisions. If the citations cannot be resolved through the informal conference process utilized by the enforcement divisions, the case is transmitted to the Appeals Division where pre-hearings and/or formal hearings are conducted. Other MIOSHA Divisions & Services The Management and Technical Services Division is responsible for a variety of services to MIOSHA staff and clients. Its staff prepare and administer most of the grants and contracts related to the federal programs that MIOSHA supports and monitor budget activity. The program areas include: The Laboratory and Equipment Services Section includes an industrial hygiene laboratory, which is accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, for analysis of air and material samples for occupational exposure to air and physical contaminants. This section also includes an instrument calibration and maintenance program for providing field instrumentation to MIOSHA industrial hygienists and safety officers to assess exposure to chemical and physical hazards in the workplace. The Management Information Systems Section is responsible for compilation of injury and illness data, provides information to MIOSHA clients about recordkeeping requirements, prepares statistical information and reports to programs about enforcement activities, monitors data related to MIOSHA strategic planning activities, and provides computer and software support to other MIOSHA programs. The MIOSHA Standards Section) provides services for the promulgation of Michigan occupational safety and health standards and rules. It coordinates the activities of three commissions (the Construction Safety Standards Commission, the General Industry Safety Standards Commission, and the Occupational Health Standards Commission) and related advisory committees, and also conducts other activities, such as public hearings to receive comments on draft standards. The Freedom of Information Section coordinates and prepares most of the responses from MIOSHA for requests for information under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. It also supports MIOSHA staff with information for depositions and subpoenas. The Consultation Education and Training Grants Administrator manages the a grant program. The grants supplement MIOSHA activities by providing competitive grants to nonprofit organizations to provide training and education in emerging safety and health issues, to address particularly dangerous occupations, and to extend MIOSHA's impact through \\"train-the-trainer\\" projects and for difficult to reach target groups. The Wage & Hour Division administers and enforces wage protection laws in Michigan (the Payment of Wages and Fringe Benefits Act, the Minimum Wage Act, the Youth Employment Standards Act, and the Prevailing Wages on State Projects Act).

It is confidently known only from tooth fossils; the first were found in the Sao Khua Formation, with more teeth later recovered from the younger Khok Kruat Formation. The type species Siamosaurus suteethorni, whose name honours Thai palaeontologist Varavudh Suteethorn, was formally described in 1986. In 2009, four teeth from China previously attributed to a pliosaur‚Äîunder the species \\"Sinopliosaurus\\" fusuiensis‚Äîwere identified as those of a spinosaurid, possibly Siamosaurus. It is yet to be determined if two partial spinosaurid skeletons from Thailand and an isolated tooth from Japan also belong to Siamosaurus. Since it is based only on teeth, Siamosauruss body size is uncertain, though it has been estimated at between in length. The holotype tooth is long. Siamosauruss teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. Its teeth had wrinkled enamel, similar to teeth from the related genus Baryonyx. As a spinosaur it would have had a long, low snout and robust forelimbs, and one possible skeleton indicates the presence of a tall sail running down its back, another typical trait of this theropod family. Siamosaurus is considered by some palaeontologists to be a dubious name, with some arguing that its teeth are hard to differentiate from those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurids, and others that it may not be a dinosaur at all. Based on dental traits, Siamosaurus and \\"S.\\" fusuiensis have been placed in the subfamily Spinosaurinae. Like in all spinosaurids, Siamosauruss teeth were conical, with reduced or absent serrations. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely piscivorous (fish-eating) animals. Spinosaurids are also known to have consumed pterosaurs and small dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of Siamosaurus itself feeding on sauropod dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. Siamosaurus' role as a partially piscivorous predator may have reduced the prominence of some contemporaneous crocodilians competing for the same food sources. Isotope analysis of the teeth of Siamosaurus and other spinosaurids indicates semiaquatic habits. Siamosaurus lived in a semi-arid habitat of floodplains and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other dinosaurs, as well as pterosaurs, fishes, turtles, and crocodyliforms.  History of discovery  northeastern Thailand, with outcrops of the Sao Khua Formation (dark gray) and the Khok Kruat and Phu Kradung Formations (light gray) The Sao Khua Formation, where the first Siamosaurus fossils were discovered, is part of the Khorat Group. The formation is dated to the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, 129.4 to 125 million years ago. In 1983, French palaeontologist √âric Buffetaut and his Thai colleague Rucha Ingavat described a set of fossil teeth recovered from the Phu Pratu Teema locality of the Sao Khua Formation, in Khon Kaen Province. They reached no conclusion as to what animal they originated from, their opinion being that the specimens belonged \\"either to an unusual theropod dinosaur, or to some unknown crocodilian\\". In 1986, a reassessment of the remains by the same authors attributed them to a new genus and species of spinosaurid theropod, which they named Siamosaurus suteethorni. The generic name alludes to the ancient name of Thailand, \\"Siam\\", and is combined with the Ancient Greek word œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ ('), meaning \\"lizard\\" or \\"reptile\\". The specific name honours Thai geologist and palaeontologist Varavudh Suteethorn, and his contributions to vertebrate palaeontology discoveries in Thailand. The best-preserved specimen from the teeth described, designated DMR TF 2043a, was chosen as the holotype of Siamosaurus. The paratypes comprise eight other well-preserved teeth catalogued as DMR TF 2043b to i. The original fossils are currently housed in the palaeontological collection of the Department of Mineral Resources, Bangkok. Siamosaurus teeth are common in the Sao Khua Formation, and further isolated specimens were found later throughout the late 20th and 21st centuries. Sculptures of the animal have been erected in various places across northeastern Thailand, including Si Wiang Dinosaur Park, the Siam Paragon shopping mall in Bangkok, the Phu Wiang Dinosaur Museum, and the Sirindhorn Museum. S. suteethorni was also illustrated on Thai postage stamps released in 1997, along with fellow Thai dinosaurs Phuwiangosaurus sirindhornae, Siamotyrannus isanensis, and Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. Thailand's Khok Kruat Formation is dated to the Aptian age (between 125 to 113 million years ago), younger than the Sao Khua Formation. The Khok Kruat Formation has provided many spinosaurid teeth, including ones from Siamosaurus and closely allied forms. Given the varied size and morphology of the teeth found, the presence of multiple spinosaur taxa in the region is likely. Nearly 60 fossil teeth were recovered from the formation during fieldwork by Thai-French palaeontological teams between 2003 to 2008, including specimens from the Sam Ran, Khok Pha Suam, and Lam Pao Dam localities. Eight of these teeth were described in detail by Kamonrak and colleagues in 2019, and classified into two main morphotypes: the Khok Kruat morphotype, which is found only in the Khok Kruat Formation, and the Siamosaurus morphotype, which includes forms widely recovered from both the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations. Siamosaurus is the first reported spinosaurid dinosaur from Asia, and subsequently to its naming, material resembling or possibly belonging to the genus has been found across the continent. In 1975, Chinese palaeontologist Hou Lian-Hai and colleagues described five teeth as a new species of the pliosauroid Sinopliosaurus, which they named S. fusuiensis, the specific name is in reference to Fusui County in Guangxi, China, from which the fossils were collected. Four of these teeth‚Äîone was not found in the museum collection‚Äîwere reassigned by Buffetaut and colleagues in 2008 to a spinosaurid theropod and referred to as \\"Sinopliosaurus\\" fusuiensis. The researchers deemed it as \\"closely related to, if not identical with\\", S. suteethorni. In 2019, \\"S.\\" fusuiensis was referred to by Thai palaeontologist Wongko Kamonrak and colleagues as Siamosaurus sp. (of uncertain species). Later in 2019, Thai palaeontologist Adun Samathi and colleagues considered the teeth as belonging to an indeterminate spinosaurid. The specimens were retrieved from China's Early Cretaceous Xinlong Formation, in which spinosaurid teeth are frequently reported, though most of them are hard to differentiate from those of Japan or Thailand without more complete fossil material, such as a skull. Buffetaut and Suteethorn suggested that the Xinlong Formation could be geologically related to the Sao Khua or Khok Kruat Formation, since similar types of fossils have been recovered in all three regions. caudal (tail) vertebrae of \\"Phuwiang spinosaurid B\\" from the Sao Khua Formation, whose remains are potentially attributable to S. suteethorni In 1994, an isolated tooth (specimen GMNH- PV-999) was found by a fossil prospector in the Sebayashi Formation, Japan. The tooth was believed, until 2003, to belong to a marine reptile, when Japanese palaeontologist Yoshikazu Hasegawa and colleagues assigned it to ?Siamosaurus sp. The tooth came from rocks dated to the Barremian, similar in age to sediments that Siamosaurus teeth have been recovered from in Thailand. In 2015, a more incomplete tooth was recovered from the same formation by two local children. Kept under the specimen number KDC-PV-0003, the tooth was assigned to an indeterminate spinosaurid in 2017 by Japanese palaeontologist Kubota Katsuhiro and colleagues. Further spinosaurid teeth from unnamed and indeterminate forms have been discovered in central China and Malaysia. In 2004, excavation began on a partial skeleton from an outcrop of the Khok Kruat Formation near the city of Khon Kaen. The specimen (SM-KK 14) consists of cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, a high neural spine (upwards- extending process from top of vertebra), pelvis (hip) fragments, a possible metacarpal (long bone of the hand), and a chevron from the tail. The cervical vertebrae and pelvic region resemble those of the European spinosaur Baryonyx walkeri, and the neural spine is elongated, similarly to those of other spinosaurids. A Siamosaurus tooth found nearby indicates the skeleton may belong to this genus, though this could also represent evidence of scavenging. The skeleton, as well as two well preserved teeth‚ÄîSM2016-1-147 and SM2016-1-165, also attributed to Siamosaurus‚Äîare currently stored in the vertebrate fossil collection of the Sirindhorn Museum, Kalasin Province. In 2019, a series of spinosaurid caudal (tail) vertebrae possibly belonging to S. suteethorni were recovered from the Sao Khua Formation, and described in a dissertation by Samathi. The fossils (SM-PW9B-11 to 17, SM-PW9B, SM- PW9A-unnumbered, SM-PW9-unnumbered, and SM 2017-1-176) were designated by Samathi as \\"Phuwiang spinosaurid B\\", and bear similarities to the possible spinosaurid Camarillasaurus and a Baryonyx specimen discovered in Portugal.  Description  Tentatively estimated size of Siamosaurus (in gray) and \\"Phuwiang spinosaurid B\\" (in red), which may represent the same taxon In 2004, American dinosaur researcher Don Lessem estimated Siamosaurus at long. In 2005, British author Sussana Davidson and colleagues gave a lower estimate of in length and weighing . In a 2016 popular book, Spanish palaeontologists Rub√©n Molina-P√©rez and Asier Larramendi estimated it at approximately long, tall at the hips and weighing . However, reliable calculations on the weight and body size of fragmentary dinosaurs like Siamosaurus are hindered by the lack of good material, such as a skull or postcranial skeleton, and thus estimates are only tentative. \\"Phuwiang spinosaurid B\\" was calculated as approximately long by Samathi in 2019. As a spinosaurid, Siamosaurus would have had low, narrow, and elongated jaws; well-built forelimbs; relatively short hindlimbs; and elongated neural spines on the vertebrae forming a sail on its back. = Type specimens = Diagram comparing the holotype tooth (first from left) with other spinosaurid teeth from Asia Fossil theropod teeth are typically identified by attributes such as the proportions, size, and curvature of the crown, as well as the presence and/or shape of the denticles (serrations). The holotype of S. suteethorni (specimen DMR TF 2043a) is in total length, with the crown being long, and wide at its base. It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat. One much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. Among theropods, this may also indicate size variation along the tooth row in the jaws, which is observed to have been prevalent in spinosaurids. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the carinae (cutting edges) of Siamosaurus teeth lack well-defined serrations, though unworn teeth do exhibit very fine denticles. Some teeth (including the holotype) have a wave-like double recurvature when viewed from the front or back, which Buffetaut and Ingavat compared to that seen in carnosaur teeth from the same formation and one Deinonychus tooth described by John Ostrom in 1969. The S. suteethorni holotype is symmetrically concave front to back, and bears 15 flutes (lengthwise grooves) on its lingual (inward facing) and labial (outward facing) surfaces. These flutes run from the base of the crown before stopping from the rounded tooth tip. A region of the holotype where the enamel (outer layer of the teeth) has weathered away reveals that these flutes extend down to the dentin (second layer of the teeth). The enamel also has a granular (finely wrinkled) texture, as seen in teeth from the spinosaurid Baryonyx. Some of the root is preserved in the holotype and, as in all theropods, there is a large pocket for the tooth pulp, which would have housed blood vessels and nerves. = Khok Kruat teeth = Of the two Khok Kruat Formation tooth morphotypes assigned by Kamonrak and colleagues in 2019, morphotype I, the Khok Kruat morphotype, is on average in total length, of which the crown takes up , with a wide base. They are oval in cross section, have well-defined carinae, and a smooth enamel surface, which becomes wrinkled at the base of the crown. They bear fine, sharply defined flutes, of which there are about 21 to 32 on each side. Morphotype II, the Siamosaurus morphotype, is on average long, with a tall crown that is wide at the base. They are also oval in cross section and have distinct carinae, but unlike the Khok Kruat morphotype, the entire length of the crown has wrinkled enamel, and the flutes are coarser and fewer in number, with 11 to 16 on each side. The Siamosaurus morphotype also shares with S. suteethorni, GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side. = Possible material =  Teeth  Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible Siamosaurus tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo The first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is not known in which jaw the tooth was positioned or which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, wide base and being slightly smaller at in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the S. suteethorni holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japanese specimen having 12 on each side. The teeth also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the S. suteethorni holotype tooth. The blood grooves (tiny furrows in the gaps between each denticle) of GMNH-PV-999 have an oblique orientation of 45 degrees, as in Baryonyx and KDC-PV-0003, the second Sebayashi formation tooth, which consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with an almost circular cross section. It has better preservation of small details than the former specimens, such as visible, though poorly defined serrations, with two to three denticles per mm (0.039 in). Like GMNH-PV-999, it has a granular texture and at least 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the crown's full length. Out of the four teeth attributed to \\"S.\\" fusuiensis, specimen IVPP V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is long and wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thai and Japanese teeth, the \\"S.\\" fusuiensis specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of the \\"S.\\" fusuiensis teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes vary in length. Buffetaut and colleagues found the \\"S.\\" fusuiensis teeth most similar to those of Siamosaurus, given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.  Postcrania  Skeletal diagram showing known elements of spinosaurid specimen SM-KK 14 Though no skeletal elements were associated with the original Siamosaurus teeth, the Khok Kruat skeleton, SM-KK 14, may be attributable to the genus. The cervical vertebrae of SM-KK 14 had elongated centra (vertebral bodies) with articulating surfaces that were not offset, as well as prominent epipophyses (processes to which neck muscles attached) and strong ligament scars. All of these characteristics were also present in Baryonyx. The cervicals also became longer towards the front of the neck and‚Äîbased on comparison with Baryonyx‚Äîmay represent the fourth, sixth, seventh, and tenth vertebrae. The dorsal vertebrae had enlarged infraprezygapophyseal fossae‚Äîdepressions under the prezygapophyses, which connect adjacent vertebrae‚Äîand their neural spines were elongated similarly to those of other spinosaurids, indicating the presence of a sail on the animal's back; like in the Asian spinosaurid Ichthyovenator. One of the neural spines of SM-KK 14 measured at least in height. The chevron lacked a process on its front end, as in other spinosaurids. Viewed distally (towards the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis had an L-shape, similar to that of Ichthyovenator and the African Suchomimus. Also as in Ichthyovenator, the hind rim of the pubis had a notch-like obturator foramen. However, in SM-KK 14 the front of the pubis was concave and the chevrons were curved backwards, in contrast to the straight condition these bones had in Ichthyovenator.  Classification  In 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified Siamosaurus as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double sideways recurvature of its teeth. At the time, Siamosauruss particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in Siamosauruss teeth to those of ceratosaurian tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth are more narrow and blade-like in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to Siamosaurus was Spinosaurus aegyptiacus from Egypt, whose fragmentary fossils had been destroyed during World War II. Like Siamosaurus, this African taxon had straight and unserrated conical teeth. Though Spinosaurus lacked the developed flutes seen in Siamosaurus, Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed Siamosaurus in the family Spinosauridae, based on the close similarities in dentition to S. aegyptiacus. Tooth of the related genus Spinosaurus, Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, Lombardy Many palaeontologists later questioned Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of Siamosaurus, given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have often been mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs. In view of this, the German palaeontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and colleagues in 2002 asserted that there is not enough material to confidently identify Siamosaurus as a dinosaur. In 2004, American palaeontologist Thomas Holtz and colleagues considered it a dubious name, stating that the teeth might instead belong to a contemporaneous fish such as a saurodontid or an ichthyodectid teleost. The same year, American palaeontologist David Weishampel and colleagues considered Siamosaurus an indeterminate theropod. In 2012, an analysis by American palaeontologist Matthew Carrano and colleagues agreed with the possibility of confusion with other reptiles, and regarded the genus as a possible indeterminate spinosaurid. They noted that oftentimes, isolated teeth are an unstable foundation for naming new theropod taxa, and most species based on them turn out to be invalid. This problem is especially common with spinosaurids, given that skull and skeletal fossils from the group are rare. Spinosaurid teeth are often mistaken for those of plesiosaurs (above) and vice versa, though there are certain differences between their dentition. Authors such as Buffetaut and Ingavat in 1986, and Hasegawa and colleagues in 2003, have noted that since crocodilian teeth are usually more strongly recurved than spinosaur teeth, they can be distinguished from each other. Crocodilians also lack the lateral double recurvature of Siamosauruss tooth crowns, which, based on their shape, were vertically inserted into the jaw, whereas long- snouted crocodilian teeth are usually angled outwards from the mouth. Though Siamosaurus and plesiosaur teeth are similar in overall shape, Buffetaut and Ingavat pointed out that plesiosaur teeth were significantly more recurved. Other researchers also noted that compared to plesiosaurs, Asian spinosaurid teeth also have coarser and more numerous flutes that extend almost the whole length of the crown. In 2008, Buffetaut and colleagues stated that the \\"S.\\" fusuiensis teeth bear carinae on the plane of the crown's curvature, a condition not observed in plesiosaur teeth. The discovery of the Khok Kruat skeleton and of baryonychine teeth with dental flutes similar to those of Siamosaurus, were also brought up by the researchers as further evidence of Siamosauruss spinosaurid classification. Later discoveries revealed that largely straight tooth crowns with flutes and a lack or reduction of serrations were unique characteristics of spinosaurid teeth. Restoration of Ichthyovenator, a spinosaurine from what is now Laos and one of the closest known relatives of Siamosaurus. In 2014, Italian palaeontologist Federico Fanti and colleagues considered the various spinosaurid teeth from East Asia, including those of S. suteethorni, as identical to those of Spinosaurus. In 2017, Brazilian palaeontologists Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz suggested that the various Asian teeth might eventually be attributed to Ichthyovenator-like forms. The researchers accepted Siamosaurus as a spinosaurid, but stated that its teeth and those of \\"S.\\" fusuiensis are too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurids to erect new taxa unequivocally; and thus considered both taxa as dubious. Carrano and colleagues noted that the Khok Kruat skeleton may provide answers to their identification. Authors such as Milner and colleagues in 2007, Bertin Tor in 2010, Holtz in 2011, and Kamonrak and colleagues in 2019 regarded the Khok Kruat skeleton as first definitive evidence of spinosaurs in Asia. In 2012, French palaeontologist Ronan Allain and colleagues described a partial skeleton from the Gr√®s sup√©rieurs Formation of Laos, and used it to name the new spinosaurid genus and species Ichthyovenator laosensis. They considered it the first definitive evidence of spinosaurids in Asia, in light of the debated identity of Siamosaurus and \\"S.\\" fusuiensis. In a 2014 abstract, Allain announced that further Ichthyovenator material, including three teeth, had been excavated. Typically of spinosaurines, Ichthyovenators teeth bore straight and unserrated crowns, though no comparison was made to the other Asian teeth. The taxonomic and phylogenetic affinities of the Spinosauridae are subject to active research and debate, given that in comparison to other theropod groups, many of the family's taxa are based on poor fossil material. Traditionally, the group is split into the subfamilies Spinosaurinae (unserrated, straight teeth with well marked flutes and more circular cross sections) and Baryonychinae (finely serrated, somewhat recurved teeth with weaker flutes and a more oval cross section). Since spinosaurines were, on average, larger animals than baryonychines, their teeth were also generally larger. The morphological variation seen in spinosaurid teeth, however, has shown that the aforementioned characteristics are not always consistent within the subfamilies. Likewise, the Khok Kruat skeleton shares mixed characteristics between Baryonyx and Spinosaurus, and its precise phylogenetic placement is uncertain pending a description of the material. The possibility that Baryonychinae is a paraphyletic (unnatural) grouping has been suggested by researchers such as Sales and Schultz, on the basis that genera such as Irritator and Angaturama (the two are possible synonyms) may represent intermediate forms between baryonychines and spinosaurines. As it is definitively known only from teeth, Siamosauruss exact position within the Spinosauridae is difficult to determine. In 2004, Brazilian palaeontologists Elaine Machado and Alexander Kellner suggested it as a possible spinosaurine, given its lack of dental serrations. Likewise in 2010, British palaeontologist David Hone and colleagues placed Siamosaurus and \\"S.\\" fusuiensis in the Spinosaurinae. British palaeontologist Thomas Arden and colleagues identified Siamosaurus as a basal (early diverging or \\"primitive\\") member of this subfamily in 2019; their cladogram can be seen below: Vertebra from specimen SM-KK14, which may belong to Siamosaurus Later in 2019, the Khok Kruat Formation teeth were also referred to the Spinosaurinae by Kamonrak and colleagues, on the basis that both the Khok Kruat and Siamosaurus morphotypes lack characteristics seen in baryonychines, such as long and slender roots, 0‚Äì10 flutes on each side, no well defined carinae, a sculptured surface of the crown base, and 45 degree orientation of the blood grooves. But they share with spinosaurines a sub-circular to oval cross section, fluted tooth crowns, well defined front and rear carinae, distinct striations on the crown, varying denticle size, and a wrinkled surface of the crown base. The authors also noted that unlike spinosaurines such as Irritator and Spinosaurus, Asian spinosaurines usually have more laterally compressed tooth crowns, and wrinkles across more of the enamel surface. In 2020, a paper by British palaeontologist Robert Smyth and colleagues considered S. suteethorni a dubious name and attributed its teeth to an indeterminate spinosaurine, given the uncertainties of classifying spinosaurid teeth at the genus or species level, as well as the degree of heterodonty (variation within the tooth row) that spinosaurines apparently exhibited. Due to new discoveries and research on spinosaurid teeth since Siamosaurus was named in 1986, a reassessment of the genus' validity is currently being prepared by Buffetaut. Palaeobiology = Diet and feeding = restoration of Siamosaurus (right) in the Sao Khua Formation environment, with the goniopholidid Sunosuchus (middle left) and a herd of the sauropods Phuwiangosaurus in the backgroundleft Buffetaut and Ingavat suggested in 1986 that Siamosaurus probably led a heavily piscivorous (fish-eating) lifestyle, since its dentition‚Äîlike those of other spinosaurids‚Äîhad a highly specialised morphology better suited for piercing rather than tearing flesh, due to the long, straight conical tooth crowns with reduced or absent serrations. The authors noted that this dental morphology is also seen in other piscivorous predators like plesiosaurs and long-snouted crocodilians. Such a dietary preference had been suggested for Baryonyx the same year by British palaeontologists Angela Milner and Alan Charig, and was later confirmed in 1997 with the discovery of acid-etched fish scales inside the body cavity of its holotype skeleton. The elongate, interlocking jaws of spinosaurids also had snout tips that fanned out into a rosette-like shape‚Äîa trait also observed in highly piscivorous crocodilians such as gharials‚Äîwhich made them well-adapted to catching and feeding on fish. Fossil evidence has shown that besides aquatic prey, spinosaurids also consumed other dinosaurs and pterosaurs. In the Sao Khua Formation, localities such as Wat Sakawan have yielded sauropod remains in association with tooth crowns from Siamosaurus, documenting either predation or scavenging on part of the latter. Annotated skull diagram of the related Spinosaurus In 2006, Thai biologist Komsorn Lauprasert examined fossils collected from the Phu Kradung, Sao Khua, and Khok Kruat Formations. In this study, the teeth of Siamosaurus and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using scanning electron microscopy. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable mechanical constraints, based on resemblances in the microstructure of their tooth enamel. Therefore, Lauprasert suggested that Siamosaurus‚Äîas a piscivorous predator‚Äîcould have replaced the ecological niche of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians. He noted that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since Siamosaurus had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This might explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place. Goniopholidid crocodilians were prevalent however, and since this group had broader, shorter snouts and thus more varied diets, Lauprasert suggested that this would have kept them from competing with Siamosaurus. A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who also noted that compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey. = Aquatic habits = In 2008, French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues compared the oxygen isotope ratios of remains from theropod and sauropod dinosaurs, crocodilians, turtles and freshwater fish recovered from eight localities in northeastern Thailand. The study revealed that Siamosaurus teeth had isotope ratios closer to those of crocodilians and freshwater turtles than other theropods, and so it may have had semiaquatic habits similar to these animals, spending much of its daily life near or in water. Discrepancies between the ratios of sauropods, Siamosaurus, and other theropods also indicate these dinosaurs drank from different sources, whether river, pond or plant water. In 2010, Amiot and colleagues published another oxygen isotope study on turtle, crocodilian, spinosaurid, other theropod remains, this time including fossils from Thailand, China, England, Brazil, Tunisia, and Morocco. The analysis showed that Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other, more terrestrial theropods, while those of Spinosaurus from Tunisia and Morocco tended to have the least difference, despite the advanced piscivorous adaptations in the skull observed for this genus. The authors suggested that piscivory and semiaquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods. By feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as niche partitioning, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition. Further lines of evidence have since demonstrated that spinosaurids, especially those within the Spinosaurinae, developed strong adaptations for aquatic environments, such as dense limb bones for buoyancy control; reduction of the pelvic girdle; and elongated neural spines on the tail, likely used for underwater propulsion.  Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography  Restoration of a generic spinosaur feeding on a sauropod carcass in the Sao Khua Formation environment, a behavior hypothesized based on teeth belonging to Siamosaurus. The left Of all the Mesozoic formations in northeastern Thailand, the Sao Khua is the most abundant and diverse in vertebrate fossil discoveries. The Khorat Group yields fossil taxa only of continental origin, with no definitive evidence for marine fossils or sedimentary structures found so far. In 1963, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi of Hokkaido University reported ichthyosaur and plesiosaur teeth from the Sao Khua Formation, but these have now been identified as belonging to Siamosaurus and a crocodilian respectively. The sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, which comprise red clays, mudstones, sandstones, siltstones and conglomerate rocks, record a fluvial environment dominated by lakes, floodplains, and meandering low-energy rivers. This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals. Besides Siamosaurus, there were theropod dinosaurs like the metriacanthosaurid Siamotyrannus isanensis, the ornithomimosaur Kinnareemimus khonkaenensis, the megaraptoran Phuwiangvenator yaemniyomi, the basal coelurosaur Vayuraptor nongbualamphuensis, a compsognathid theropod, and indeterminate birds. Theropod eggs with embryos have also been recovered from the formation. There were also sauropods like the titanosauriform Phuwiangosaurus sirindhornae, mamenchisaurids, and indeterminate forms. Sauropod remains are some of the most abundant in the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations. No ornithischian (or \\"bird-hipped\\") dinosaur fossils have been found in the Sao Khua Formation, possibly suggesting that they were uncommon compared to saurischian (or \\"lizard-hipped\\") dinosaurs. The faunal assemblage also included indeterminate pterosaurs; carettochelyid, adocid, and softshell turtles; hybodont sharks like hybodontids, ptychodontids, and lonchidiids; pycnodontiform fish; ray-finned fishes such as sinamiids and semionotids; and the goniopholidid crocodyliforms Sunosuchus phuwiangensis, Siamosuchus phuphokensis, and Theriosuchus grandinaris. The Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations had a more semi-arid climate than the older, more humid Phu Kradung Formation, dated to the Berriasian. Geological map of the Khorat Plateau in northeast Thailand The Khok Kruat Formation is composed mostly of sandstones, conglomerates, siltstones, and shales. Similarly to the Sao Khua Formation, the deposition of these sediments occurred in an arid to semi-arid floodplain environment of slow-moving, meandering rivers. This ecosystem included pterosaurs, sinamiid fish; carettochelyid and acocid turtles; ptychodontid, hybodontid, and thaiodontid sharks; and the crocodyliform Khoratosuchus jintasakuli, as well as goniopholidids. Besides Siamosaurus, the dinosaur fauna of the Khok Kruat Formation included the carcharodontosaurid Siamraptor suwati; iguanodontians like Sirindhorna khoratensis, Ratchasimasaurus suranaerae, and Siamodon nimngami; a titanosauriform sauropod similar to Phuwiangosaurus; an indeterminate ceratopsian; and various indeterminate theropods. The formation is probably equivalent to the Gr√®s sup√©rieurs Formation of Laos, since animals like spinosaurids, sauropods, and derived (\\"advanced\\") iguanodontians have also been found there. In 2007, Milner and colleagues suggested that spinosaurids and iguanodontians may have spread from western to eastern Laurasia‚Äîthe northern supercontinent at the time‚Äîduring the Aptian, based on their distribution and presence in the Khok Kruat Formation. American palaeontologist Stephen Brusatte and colleagues noted in 2010 that the discovery of spinosaurids in Asia, a family previously known only from Europe, Africa, and South America, suggests a faunal interchange between Laurasia and Gondwana (in the south) during the early Late Cretaceous. Though it may also be possible that spinosaurids already had a cosmopolitan distribution before the Middle Cretaceous, preceding the breakup of Laurasia from Gondwana. However, the authors noted that more evidence is needed to test this hypothesis. In 2012, Allain and colleagues suggested such a global distribution may have occurred earlier across Pangaea before the Late Jurassic, even if Asia became separated from the supercontinent first. In 2019, Spanish palaeontologist Elisabete Malafaia and colleagues also indicated a complex biogeographical pattern for spinosaurs during the Early Cretaceous, based on anatomical similarities between Ichthyovenator and the European genus Vallibonavenatrix.

He clinched Polish championship with Szombierki Bytom in 1980. His debut with the Polish national team was in Port-au-Prince on 13 April 1974 against Haiti. Ogaza's last appearance with the national team was against Portugal on 23 February 1981. Ogaza played 21 matches for the Polish national team, scoring 6 goals. With many great players to choose from, Kazimierz G√≥rski did not pick Ogaza for the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, but 2 years later, Ogaza was a member of the Polish Olympic team which brought silver from Montreal in 1976 Roman Ogaza died in Forbach, near Metz, in March 2006, at the age of 53.

He played college football for the University of Michigan and was a member of Michigan's undefeated 1947 and 1948 teams. He thereafter served as an assistant at the University of Maine (1951-1952), Eastern Michigan University (1953), Michigan (1954-1965) before joining the NFL with the Minnesota Vikings (1967-1970, 1978-1986), as the head coach of the National Football League's St. Louis Cardinals (1971-1972), and assistant coaching stints with the Detroit Lions (1973-1974), San Francisco 49ers (1975), and Seattle Seahawks (1976-1977). College career Born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Hollway attended the University of Michigan, playing at the end position for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1947 to 1949. After graduating in 1950, Hollway entered the coaching ranks the following year as an assistant at the University of Maine. After two seasons, he returned to the state of Michigan as both an assistant football and head basketball coach at Eastern Michigan University in 1953. From 1954 to 1965, he was an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan. NFL career On January 22, 1966, Hollway announced he was resigning to enter private business, but that time away, which included doing radio commentary on Wolverine games, lasted only one season before he came back as defensive line coach of the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings under new head coach Bud Grant. During his first season with the team, he helped shape a group of linemen who became known as the \\"Purple People Eaters,\\" including two future Hall of Famers in Carl Eller and rookie Alan Page. Over the next three years, Hollway was promoted to defensive coordinator. Four years of success, including an appearance in Super Bowl IV, raised Hollway's profile and led to his hiring as head coach of the Cardinals on February 12, 1971. However, the team was unable to beat out either the Dallas Cowboys or the resurgent Washington Redskins over the next two seasons, with Hollway paying the price with his dismissal on December 18, 1972, one day after the end of the 1972 NFL season. The Cardinals finished 4-9-1 in both of Hollway's seasons with the Cardinals, as the team suffered through numerous injuries and inconsistent play at quarterback, as Hollway shuffled between Jim Hart, Pete Beathard and Gary Cuozzo with little success, despite the presence of fleet wide receiver John Gilliam (who was traded to Minnesota in 1972) and future Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end Jackie Smith. In February 1973, Hollway was hired a Detroit Lions' assistant coach under Don McCafferty. However, McCafferty died suddenly during the team's 1974 training camp, and Hollway resigned as the lions secondary coach in January 1975. In 1975, Hollway became the defensive backs coach for the San Francisco 49ers. In January 1976, after 49ers head coach Dick Nolan was replaced, Hollway became defensive backfield coach with the expansion Seattle Seahawks. In April 1978, Hollway resigned to again serve as defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings, but became involved in controversy when the Seahawks claimed the Vikings had tampered with him while still under contract. Following the retirement of Grant at the conclusion of the 1983 NFL season, Hollway was demoted to quality control assistant, serving primarily as a personnel director and scout. Hollway's son Michael retired in 2011 after serving as the head football coach at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio for 25 years. His son Bruce is a managing partner for John Hancock Financial Network in Maple Grove, Minnesota.

Its chief responsibility is to \\"protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public\\" by controlling entry to the register, and suspending or removing members when necessary. It also sets the standards for medical schools in the UK. Membership of the register confers substantial privileges under Part VI of the Medical Act 1983. It is a criminal offence to make a false claim of membership. The GMC is supported by fees paid by its members, and it became a registered charity in 2001. History The Medical Act 1858 established the General Council of Medical Education and Registration of the United Kingdom as a statutory body. Initially its members were elected by the members of the profession, and enjoyed widespread confidence from the profession. Purpose All the GMC's functions derive from a statutory requirement for the establishment and maintenance of a register, which is the definitive list of doctors as provisionally or fully \\"registered medical practitioners\\", within the public sector in Britain. The GMC controls entry to the List of Registered Medical Practitioners (\\"the medical register\\"). The Medical Act 1983 (amended) notes that, \\"The main objective of the General Council in exercising their functions is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public.\\" Secondly, the GMC regulates and sets the standards for medical schools in the UK, and liaises with other nations' medical and university regulatory bodies over medical schools overseas, leading to some qualifications being mutually recognised. Since 2010, it also regulates postgraduate medical education. Thirdly, the GMC is responsible for a licensing and revalidation system for all practising doctors in the UK, separate from the registration system, which was given legal effect by order of the Privy Council on 3 December 2012. Activities and powers Due to the principle of autonomy and law of consent there is no legislative restriction on who can treat patients or provide medical or health-related services. In other words, it is not a criminal offence to provide what would be considered medical assistance or treatment to another person ‚Äì and not just in an emergency. This is in contrast with the position in respect of animals, where it is a criminal offence under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 for someone who is not a registered veterinary surgeon (or in certain more limited circumstances a registered veterinary nurse) to provide treatment (save in an emergency) to an animal they do not own. Parliament, since the enactment of the 1858 Act, has conferred on the GMC powers to grant various legal benefits and responsibilities to those medical practitioners who are registered with the GMC - a public body and association, as described, of the Medical Act of 1983, by Mr Justice Burnett in British Medical Association v General Medical Council. Through which, by an Order in the Privy Council, the GMC describes \\"The main objective of the General Council in exercising their functions is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public\\". The GMC is funded by annual fees required from those wishing to remain registered and fees for examinations. Fees for registration have risen significantly in the last few years: 2007 fees = ¬£290, 2008 fees = ¬£390, 2009 fees = ¬£410, 2010 fees = ¬£420, 2011 fees = ¬£420, with a 50% discount for doctors earning under ¬£32,000.GMC website ‚Äì press release ‚Äì Fees cut for newly qualified doctors In 2011, following the Command Paper \\"Enabling Excellence-Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers\\", registration fees were reduced by the GMC in accordance with the Government's strategy for reforming and simplifying the system for regulating healthcare workers in the UK and social workers and social care workers in England and requiring that Enabling Excellence Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers - para 1.7 \\"[A]t a time of pay restraint in both the public and private sectors, the burden of fees on individual registrants needs to be minimised.\\" =Registering doctors in the UK= Registration with the GMC confers a number of privileges and duties. GMC registration may be either provisional or full. Provisional registration is granted to those who have completed medical school and enter their first year (F1) of medical training; this may be converted into full registration upon satisfactory completion of the first year of postgraduate training. In the past, a third type of registration (\\"limited registration\\") was granted to doctors who had graduated outside the UK and who had completed the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board examination but who were yet to complete a period of work in the UK. Limited registration was abolished on 19 October 2007 and now international medical graduates can apply for provisional or full registration depending on their level of experience ‚Äì they still have to meet the GMC's requirement for knowledge and skills and for English language. The GMC administers the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test (PLAB), which has to be sat by non-European Union overseas doctors before they may practice medicine in the UK as a registered doctor. A registered practitioner found to have committed some offences can be removed (\\"struck off\\") from the Medical Register. =Licensing and revalidating doctors in the UK= The GMC is now empowered to license and regularly revalidate the practice of doctors in the UK. When the licensing scheme was introduced in 2009, 13,500 (6.1%) of registered doctors chose not to be licensed. - GMC website. Unlicensed but registered doctors are likely to be non-practising lecturers, managers, or practising overseas, or retired. Whereas all registered doctors in the UK were offered a one-off automatic practise licence in November 2009, since December 2012 no licence will be automatically revalidated, but will be subject to a revalidation process every five years. No doctor may now be registered for the first time without also being issued a licence to practice, - GMC website - overseas regulators briefing. although a licensed doctor may give up their licence if they choose. No unlicensed but registered doctor in the UK is subject to revalidation. However, unlicensed but registered doctors in the UK are still subject to fitness-to-practice proceedings, and required to follow the GMC's good medical practice guidance. =Setting standards of good medical practice= The GMC sets standards of professional and ethical conduct that doctors in the UK are required to follow. The main guidance that the GMC provides for doctors is called Good Medical Practice.Good Medical Practice - GMC website. This outlines the standard of professional conduct that the public expects from its doctors and provides principles that underpin the GMC's fitness to practise decisions. Originally written in 1995, a revised edition came into force in November 2006, and another with effect from 22 April 2013. The content of Good Medical Practice has been rearranged into four domains of duties. Their most significant change is the replacement of a duty to, \\"Act without delay if you have good reason to believe that you or a colleague may be putting patients at risk,\\" to a new duty to, \\"Take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is being compromised\\". Alongside the guidance booklet are a range of explanatory guidelines, including a new one about the use of social media. The GMC also provides additional guidance for doctors on specific ethical topics, such as treating patients under the age of 18, end of life care, and conflicts of interest. =Medical education= The GMC regulates medical education and training in the United Kingdom. It runs 'quality assurance' programmes for UK medical schools and postgraduate deaneries to ensure that the necessary standards and outcomes are achieved. In February 2008 the then Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson, agreed with recommendations of the Tooke Report which advised that the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board should be assimilated into the GMC. Whilst recognising the achievements made by PMETB, Professor John Tooke concluded that regulation needed to be combined into one body; that there should be one organisation that looked after what he called 'the continuum of medical education', from the moment someone chooses a career in medicine until the point that they retire. The merger, which took effect on 1 April 2010, was welcomed by both PMETB and the GMC. =Concerns about doctors= A registered medical practitioner may be referred to the GMC if there are doubts about their fitness to practise in the UK. These are divided into concerns about health and other concerns about ability or behaviour. In the past these issues were dealt with separately and differently, but now pass through a single fitness to practise process.Transitional arrangements - FAQ on GMC website. The GMC has powers to issue advice or warnings to doctors, accept undertakings from them, or refer them to a fitness to practise panel. The GMC's fitness to practise panels can accept undertakings from a doctor, issue warnings, impose conditions on a doctor's practice, suspend a doctor, or erase them from the medical register ('struck off').GMC website ‚Äì Fitness to Practise panels The GMC is concerned with ensuring that doctors are safe to practice. Its role is not, for example, to fine doctors or to compensate patients following problems. The outcomes of hearings are made available on the GMC website. Reform Since 2001, the GMC's fitness to practise decisions have been subject to review by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), which may vary sentences.CHRE website ‚Äì Final fitness to practise decisions The GMC is also accountable to the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Health Select Committee. In its first report on the GMC, the Committee described the GMC as \\"a high-performing medical regulator\\", but called for some changes to fitness to practice rules and practices, including allowing the GMC the right to appeal sentences of its panels. In the 2000s, the GMC implemented wide-ranging reforms of its organisation and procedures. In part, such moves followed the Shipman killings. They followed a direction set by the UK government in its white paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety. In 2001 freemasonry was added to the register of interests of council members that the GMC published. One of the key changes was to reduce the size of the Council itself, and changing its composition to an equal number of medical and lay members, rather than the majority being doctors.http://www.gmc- uk.org/news/1517.asp GMC press release - GMC Council appointments Legislation passed in December 2002 allowed changes in the composition of the Council from the following year, with the number of members reducing from 104 to 35, increasing the proportion of lay members. In July 2011, the GMC accepted further changes that would separate its presentation of fitness to practise cases from their adjudication, which would become the responsibility of a new body, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. The GMC had previously been criticised for combining these two roles in a single organization. A forthcoming reform to medical registration is the introduction of revalidation of doctors, more similar to the periodic process common in American states, in which the professional is expected to prove his or her professional development and skills. Revalidation is scheduled to start in 2012.GMC website ‚Äì Revalidation date set for 2012 On 16 February 2011, the Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley, made a Written Ministerial Statement in the Justice section entitled 'Health Care Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers' in which he said: Within the Command Paper:- Sir Liam Donaldson, a former chief medical officer had recently told the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust public inquiry that he had been involved in discussions about the Nursing and Midwifery Council merging with the General Medical Council, but proponents had \\"backed off\\" from the idea and the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence was created instead to share best practice. Sir Liam said the CHRE had been \\"reasonably successful\\" but it would be \\"worth looking at the possibility of a merger\\" between the GMC and NMC. Criticism =Self-regulation and handling of complaints= Concern has resulted from several studies that suggest that the GMC's handling of complaints appears to differ depending on race or overseas qualifications, but it has been argued that this might be due to indirect factors. The mortality and morbidity among doctors going through GMC procedures has attracted attention. In 2003/4 between 4 and 5% of doctors undergoing fitness to practice scrutiny died. In response to a request for information in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the GMC revealed that 68 doctors had died recently whilst undergoing a fitness to practice investigation, In an internal report, \\"Doctors Who Commit Suicide While Under GMC Fitness to Practise Investigation\\",GMC Internal review embargoed until 14 December 2014 the GMC identified 114 doctors, with a median age of 45, who had died during the previous eight years, and had an open and disclosed GMC case at the time of death, and in which 28 had committed suicide and recommended 'emotional resilience' training for doctors. The Health and Safety Executive's provisional figure for the number of workers fatally injured in 2013/14 was 133,HSE: Health and safety statistics and corresponds to a rate of fatal injury of 0.44 deaths per 100 000 workers. According to the recent Horsfall review, the number of deaths of doctors under GMC procedures in the eight years between 2005 and 2013 accounted for more than 10% of the country's death rate at work of the entire UK workforce, annually and consistently. No other organisation besides the GMC had come anywhere near this occupational fatality rate. In a warning on \\"over-regulation\\" Dr Clare Gerada, a former chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, commented: Following the suicide of Professor John E Davies from Guy's Hospital, London, HM Senior Coroner for the area wrote to Niall Dickson with her Regulation 28: Report to Prevent Future Deaths: Academics at King's College London researched the effects of increased regulatory transparency on the medical profession and found significant unintended consequences. As doctors reacted anxiously to regulation and media headlines, they practised more defensively. =Charitable status= The GMC was registered as a charity with the Charity Commission of England and Wales on 9 November 2001. The Commissioners having considered the court and the Commission's jurisdiction to consider an organisation's status, which had previously been considered by the courts, in issues of charitable status. Charities do not normally have to pay income tax or corporation tax, capital gains tax or stamp duty. Following the granting of charitable status the GMC obtained tax relief backdated to 1 April 1994. Charities pay no more than 20% of normal business rates on the buildings they use and occupy. The GMC received confirmation of 80% business rates relief effective from April 1995. the accounts submitted by the GMC to the Charity Commission showed an income of ¬£97 million, spending of ¬£101m with reserves of ¬£68m. =Shipman inquiry= The GMC was most heavily criticised by Dame Janet Smith as part of her inquiry into the issues arising from the case of Dr Harold Shipman. \\"Expediency,\\" says Dame Janet, \\"replaced principle.\\" Dame Janet maintained that the GMC failed to deal properly with Fitness to Practise (FTP) cases, particularly involving established and respected doctors.Shipman inquiry. Safeguarding patients: lessons from the past‚Äîproposals for the future. 5th report, 2004. Online version . In response to the Shipman report, Sir Liam Donaldson, the then Chief Medical Officer, published a report titled Good doctors, safer patients, which appeared in 2006.Donaldson, L. Good doctors, safer patients: Proposals to strengthen the system to assure and improve the performance of doctors and to protect the safety of patients; a report by the Chief Medical Officer . Department of Health, 2006-07-14. Accessed 2006-09-17. Donaldson echoed concerns about GMC FTP procedures and other functions of the Council. In his view, complaints were dealt with in a haphazard manner, the GMC caused distress to doctors over trivial complaints while tolerating poor practice in other cases. He accused the Council of being \\"secretive, tolerant of sub- standard practice and dominated by the professional interest, rather than that of the patient\\". Former President of the General Medical Council, Sir Donald Irvine, called for the current Council to be disbanded and re-formed with new members. =Penny Mellor= In July 2010 the GMC was severely criticized in an open letter in the British Medical Journal by Professionals Against Child Abuse for the decision to include Penny Mellor on the GMC's Expert Group on Child Protection. According to the letter, Penny Mellor had been convicted and imprisoned for conspiring to abduct a child, and had led protracted hostile campaigns including false allegations against doctors and other professionals involved in child protection cases. She had also campaigned against Sir Roy Meadow and Professor David Southall, who were erased from the medical register by the GMC but subsequently re-instated after court rulings. Penny Mellor subsequently resigned from the Expert Group. =John Walker-Smith= In March 2012, the High Court of England and Wales overturned a 2010 decision by the GMC to strike pediatric gastroenterologist John Walker-Smith off the medical register for serious professional misconduct. In his ruling, the presiding judge criticized what he said were the GMC's \\"inadequate and superficial reasoning and, in a number of instances, a wrong conclusion,\\" and stated, \\"It would be a misfortune if this were to happen again.\\" =Junior doctors contract= Controversy arose in July 2016 when the General Medical Council announced it would be appointing Charlie Massey as its new CEO. Massey had been an adviser to health secretary Jeremy Hunt on the controversial Junior doctors contract, which had led to several days of industrial action by doctors over concerns about feasibility and patient safety. Many doctors felt this reflected a clear conflict of interest and signed a petition to the medical council for transparency in its appointment process. The medical council issued a response claiming that they were still an independent body. Massey had also signally failed to distinguish himself in front of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. Officers The Council is composed of six medical professionals and six lay members. The current Chair of the General Medical Council is Dame Clare Marx, the first woman to be chair of the GMC. The current chief executive and registrar is Charlie Massey. The first woman was elected to the GMC in 1933, however the candidate (Christine Murrell) died before she could take her seat. It was not until 1955 that Janet Aitken was elected and took her seat. Now no one on the council is elected: they are all appointed. Other regulators of healthcare professionals The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA), is an independent body accountable to the UK Parliament, with the remit to promote the health and well-being of patients and the public in the regulation of health professionals. But the PSA does not have legal power to investigate complaints about regulators. It advises the four UK government health departments on issues relating to the regulation of health professionals; scrutinising and overseeing the work of the nine regulatory bodies:- * Health and Care Professions Council (regulates other health professions in the UK) * Nursing and Midwifery Council (regulates nurses and midwives) * General Optical Council * General Dental Council * General Chiropractic Council * General Osteopathic Council * General Pharmaceutical Council * Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland * General Medical Council In response to the Government's recent proposals the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence has made a call for ideas in their December 2011 paper 'Cost effectiveness and efficiency in health professional regulation'- Cost effectiveness and efficiency in health professional regulation (December 2011) for 'right-touch regulation' described as being Comparison to other countries As noted at Medical license other countries, including New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Singapore, have a central regulator similar to the GMC. In the United States, each state has its own regulatory board for doctors. In Germany, each state has an √Ñrztekammer with lawful authority to regulate the medical profession; there is no federal level authority for the Federal Republic of Germany, although regulations of University Training and qualification (medical state examinations) are set by federal law in the Bundestag (the federal parliament in Germany) . Nevertheless, the Bundes√§rztekammer, a voluntary association of private law, was founded to support the professions' interests. As in Germany and the US, the medical profession in Canada is not regulated at the federal level. The Canadian medical profession is regulated, instead, at the provincial or territorial level (e.g. the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario). Nonetheless, the Canadian Medical Association serves a similar function, in that country, as its German and American counterparts do in those two respective countries. The Medical Council of Ireland acts as regulator in the Republic of Ireland. References Further reading * MacAlister, D.

It is an obscure tooth taxon. History Famous Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian (in older references his name is given as C. C. Young) named this genus from IVP AS V232-234, a group of four isolated partial teeth found near Weiyuan, Guangyuan, Sichuan Basin. He described them as \\"long, slender, moderately curved and compressed; ridged anterior and posterior sides with no trace of serrations; enamel very thin\\". He considered the genus to be \\"coelurosaurian\\", which at that time meant a small theropod. The most distinctive characteristic of these teeth was their lack of serrations.Yang Zhongjian. (1942). Fossil vertebrates from Kuangyuan, N. Szechuan, China. Bulletin of the Geological Society of China 22(3-4):293-309. Because of the small amount of material, Sinocoelurus has attracted little attention since its description, outside of reviews. It is usually considered a dubious name of either coelurosauriancoelurid affinities (if the source predates the acceptance of Coelurosauria as a wastebasket taxon as traditionally used), or uncertain theropod affinities (if published after this). The most recent review classifies it as Tetanurae incertae sedis and dubious. Paleobiology As a small theropod, Sinocoelurus would have been an agile, bipedal carnivore.

He played as a midfielder. Career =Chilean league= He started his career at Chilean club O'Higgins, whom he began playing for in 1994 at the age of nineteen. He played at O'Higgins until 1996, scoring eight goals in eighty-one games. He then caught the eye of professional club Universidad de Chile. They signed him, and he played ninety games for them between 1997 and 1999, again scoring eight goals. =Newcastle United= After impressive domestic and international performances, Acu√±a was attracting attention from many big clubs. He eventually signed for Newcastle United, after manager Bobby Robson beat off competition from Manchester United and Parma to clinch Acu√±a's signature, earning him a ¬£900,000 move to Newcastle United in October 2000, after receiving a work permit. He made his debut for Newcastle on Saturday 28 October 2000 in a 1-0 away defeat to West Ham United. Two months later he scored his first goal for the club and the winner in the 2-1 victory against Leeds United. The goal was later voted \\"Goal of the Week\\" by the BBC. He was at Newcastle for four seasons, playing forty-six league games (including eleven as substitute), scoring six times.

Here, he impressed players and pundits alike and helped his country to the last 16 stage of the tournament, where they bowed out in a 4-1 defeat to favourites Brazil. Acu√±a was seen as one of the breakthrough players of the tournament and he also had his first experience of playing in Europe, which would prove not to be his last. A year later he was involved in another international tournament. This time his services were required in the Copa Am√©rica. He started four games as Chile reached the semi-finals but were knocked out 5-3 on penalties against Uruguay after a 1-1 draw. They also lost the third place playoff 2-1 against Mexico four days later.

Discovery and naming KMV 8701 was originally discovered in 1987. The specimen was identified as a new species, and was named Dilophosaurus sinensis. Then in 1994, during a field expedition, a more complete specimen was found, and was assigned to the same species. In 2003, Dong Zhiming studied the material of Sinosaurus, finding it to be quite similar to Dilophosaurus sinensis. As Sinosaurus was named earlier, by Young in 1948, \\"Dilophosaurus\\" sinensis became its junior synonym. The composite term Sinosaurus comes from Sinae, the Latin word for the Chinese, and the Greek word sauros (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ) meaning \\"lizard\\"; thus \\"Chinese lizard\\". The specific name, triassicus, refers to the Triassic, the period that the fossils were originally thought to date from. Sinosaurus was described and named by Chung Chien Young, who is known as the 'Father of Chinese Vertebrate Paleontology', in 1948. Maxilla of specimen ZLJT01 Over the years, paleontologists referred additional specimens to D. sinensis which are now assigned to Sinosaurus. Dong (2003) referred specimen LDM-LCA10 which consists of a skull and an incomplete skeleton. In 2012, Xing referred two individuals, ZLJ0003 which consists of a partial skull and an incomplete skeleton, and ZLJT01 which is a juvenile individual that consists of a premaxillary fragment, an incomplete maxilla, a maxillary fragment, a lacrimal, both frontals, both parietals, an incomplete braincase, an incomplete dentary, an atlantal intercentrum, two dorsal rib fragments, and a partial proximal caudal neural arch, to Sinosaurus. The holotype, IVPP V34, was found in the Lower Lufeng Formation, and consists of two maxillary (upper jaw) fragments, four maxillary teeth, and a lower jaw fragment with three teeth. The teeth are laterally compressed, and feature fine serrations both at their anterior and posterior edges. The teeth are also variable in size and are curved backwards. This material is too fragmentary to determine the length and weight of this dinosaur. Over the years, other fossils were referred to Sinosaurus, some of which were material that was shown to belong to two sauropodomorphs. The fossils include a postcrania, with a sacrum with three preserved sacral vertebrae. The material assigned to \\"Sinosaurus postcrania\\" includes a mix of plateosaurid and melanorosaurid elements. All the material from the Red Beds block has now been reassigned to Jingshanosaurus Frontal view of mounted skeleton cast. Shaojin Hu (1993) assigned specimen KMV 8701 to Dilophosaurus sinensis. In 2013, a study by Currie et al., confirmed that D. sinensis was the same animal as Sinosaurus triassicusCurrie, Xing, Wu and Dong, in prep. \\"Anatomy and relationships of Sinosaurus triassicus (‚ÄúDilophosaurus sinensis‚Äù) from the Lufeng Formation (Lower Jurassic) of Yunnan, China\\". On the other hand, Wang et al. (2017) stated that it needs to be further investigated whether D. sinensis is indeed a junior synonym of S. triassicus, and noted that the two species are different at least in the anatomy of the premaxilla. The authors tentatively assigned D. sinensis to the genus Sinosaurus, but retained it as a species distinct from Sinosaurus triassicus. Specimen KMV 8701 consists of a skull (measuring 525 mm), and is nearly complete. The specimen KMV 8701 is about long, meaning Sinosaurus was about that length. KMV 8701 has been assigned now to Sinosaurus, but the specimen still lacks sufficient description and preparation. In 2012, a new specimen of Sinosaurus was described, and was found to represent a new species. Description Restored head According to Carrano et al. (2012) D. sinensis, now considered to be at least congeneric with Sinosaurus triassicus, can be distinguished based on the fact that a vertical groove is present on the lateral premaxilla adjacent to contact with the maxilla. Sinosaurus is the only \\"dilophosaurid\\" known from a complete braincase. Cryolophosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Zupaysaurus and Coelophysis kayentakatae are all known from partial braincases. Two partial braincases were found before 2012, and are probably mostly complete, except that large sections are obscured by sediments. In 2011, an exceptionally well-preserved braincase was found, only missing the frontal bones and orbitosphenoid. Classification Originally thought to be a coelophysoid related to Dilophosaurus and Cryolophosaurus, Oliver Rauhut in 2003 showed Sinosaurus to be a more advanced theropod, related to Cryolophosaurus and \\"Dilophosaurus\\" sinensis. In 2013, in an unpublished work, Carano agreed that Sinosaurus is a theropod.M. T. Carrano. 2013. Taxonomic opinions on the Dinosauria. Sinosaurus has been considered a nomen dubium in a few works, although now that \\"Dilophosaurus\\" sinensis is referred to it, it is considered valid. Dilophosaurus sinensis was shown to be a junior synonym of Sinosaurus in 2003. It is possibly closer to the Antarctic theropod Cryolophosaurus, based on the fact that the anterior end of the jugal does not participate in the internal antorbital fenestra and that the maxillary tooth row is completely in front of the eye socket. D. sinensis was exhibited in 1998 at Dinofest in Philadelphia.Glut, D. F. (1999). Dinosaurs, the Encyclopedia, Supplement 1: McFarland & Company, Inc., 442pp. Although the skull of D. sinensis sports large nasolacrimal crests superficially like those reconstructed in D. wetherilli, features elsewhere in the skeleton suggest it is closer to tetanuran theropods. Rauhut (2003) regarded D. sinensis as a basal tetanuran most closely related to Sinosaurus and Cryolophosaurus. Lamanna et al. (1998b) examined the material ascribed to D. sinensis and found it to be synonymous with Sinosaurus triassicus.Lamanna, M. C., Holtz, T. R. Jr, and Dodson, P., 1998, A reassessment of the Chinese Theropod Dinosaur Dilophosaurus sinensis: Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Volume 18, Supplement to Number 3. Abstracts of papers. Fifty-eighth annual meeting, Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort, Snowbird, Utah, September 30 ‚Äì October 3, 1998, p. 57a. This cladistic finding was confirmed in 2003 by Dong. alt= The Lufeng Dinosaurian Museum discovered a new specimen of Sinosaurus (ZLJT01) in 2007 from the Lufeng Basin. It consists of an incomplete skull and other postcranial fragments. Phylogenetic analysis of this specimen, demonstrates that Sinosaurus is a more derived theropod, and is not the most basal dilophosaurid, as held by Smith et al. A cladogram was identified by Christophe Hendrickx and Oct√°vio Mateus. It placed Sinosaurus and Cryolophosaurus in a polytomy at the base of Tetanurae. Paleobiology Restoration showing dental abnormality based on ZLJT01. =Crest function= Sinosaurus and Dilophosaurus both possess dual crests. However, it was found that the crests could not be used in combat. =Feeding= The skull of Sinosaurus has a deep notch between the premaxilla and maxilla. Dong (2003) proposed that the notch was used to house jaw muscles, giving Sinosaurus a powerful bite. Based on the estimated power of its jaws, Sinosaurus might have either been a carnivore or a scavenger. Dong suspected that the premaxilla was covered in a narrow, hooked beak, that was used to rip open skin and abdominal flesh. He also thought that the crest would have been used to hold open the abdominal cavity while feeding. Dong studied the feet of Sinosaurus as well, finding a resemblance with the feet of modern vultures. The feet of Sinosaurus were probably adapted to help it feed on large-bodied animals, such as prosauropods. =Paleopathology= A study by Xing et al. (2013) examined the effect of the traumatic loss of teeth on the dental alveolus (the socket in the jaw where the roots of teeth are held) in dinosaurs. Sinosaurus is the first dinosaur where remodeling of the alveolus in the jaw was observed. The authors concluded that this finding \\"contributes to mounting evidence suggesting theropods were highly resilient to a broad spectrum of traumas and diseases.\\" The dental alveolus found on Sinosaurus is the first documented dental pathology found on a dinosaur. Paleoecology =Provenance and occurrence= Drawing of a Sinosaurus feeding on a Yunnanosaurus The type specimen of Sinosaurus triassicus IVPP V34 was recovered in the Zhangjiawa Member of the Lufeng Formation, in Yunnan, China. These remains were discovered at the Dark Red Beds that were deposited during the Sinemurian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 196-183 million years ago. Several other discoveries referred to Sinosaurus were made in the Zhangjiawa Member: specimens IVPP V97 (postcrania), IVPP V36 (teeth), IVPP 37 (teeth), IVPP V88 (ilium), IVPP V35 (teeth and postcranial bones), IVPP V100 and IVPP V48 (teeth and postcranial bones) discovered in 1938 by M.

Specimen IVPP V504, referred to Sinosaurus, a maxilla with four teeth, was collected by Lee in the 1940s, in the Dull Purplish Beds of Shawan Member of the Lufeng Formation, that were deposited during the Hettangian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 201-199 million years ago. Several other discoveries were made in the Shawan Member: parts of two skeletons attributed to Sinosaurus were discovered by Sou in 1956,C.-C. Young. 1966. On a new locality of the Lufengosaurus of Yunnan. Vertebrata PalAsiatica 10(1):64‚Äì67 specimen IVPP V279 (tooth) was discovered by C.C. Young in 1938, in dark red clayish sandstone, and specimen IVPP V381 (several teeth) was discovered by C.C. Young, in blue mudstone. The D. sinensis remains, KMV 8701, a nearly complete skeleton, now referred to Sinosaurus, were recovered in the Shawan Member of Lufeng Formation. This material was discovered in 1987 in the Dull Purplish Beds that were deposited during the Hettangian stage of the Early Jurassic, approximately 201-199 million years ago. =Fauna and habitat= In the Lufeng Formation, Sinosaurus shared its paleoenvironment with therapsids like Morganucodon, Oligokyphus, and Bienotherium; archosaurs like Pachysuchus; diapsids like Strigosuchus; crocodylomorphs like Platyognathus and Microchampsa; the early mammal Hadrocodium; and other early reptiles. Contemporary dinosaurs include indeterminate sauropods; the early thyreophorans Bienosaurus lufengensis and Tatisaurus oehleri; the supposed chimeric ornithopod \\"Dianchungosaurus lufengensis\\"; the prosauropods Gyposaurus sinensis, Lufengosaurus huenei, L. magnus, Jingshanosaurus xinwaiensis,Y.

In 2009, a study led by Li-Da Xing found that footprints from the Lufeng Formation were unique among ichnogenera, and named the footprints Changpeipus pareschequier. The study hypothesized that they were produced by a coelophysoid; there are many possible trackmakers, however, including both Sinosaurus and Coelophysis sp.

The game enables players to compete against up to six other kingdoms allowing players to conquer opponents by defeating them in war (with troops or machines), capturing their buildings with spies, or offering opponents money for their kingdom. The Seven Kingdoms series went on to include a sequel, Seven Kingdoms II: The Fryhtan Wars. In 2007, Enlight released a further title in the Seven Kingdoms series, '. Gameplay Seven Kingdoms made departures from the traditional real-time strategy model of \\"gather resources, build a base and army, and attack\\" set by other RTS games. The economic model bears more resemblance to a turn-based strategy game than to the traditional \\"build-workers, and harvest-resources\\" system in games such as Command & Conquer, StarCraft, and Age of Empires. The game features an espionage system that allows players to train and control spies individually, who each have a spying skill that increases over time. The player is responsible for catching potential spies in their own kingdom. Inns built within the game allow players to hire mercenaries of various occupations, skill levels, and races. Skilled spies of enemy races are essential to a well- conducted espionage program, and players can bolster their forces by grabbing a skilled fighter or give one's own factories, mines, and towers of science a boost by hiring a highly skilled professional. For instance, having a skilled Persian general can make capturing and keeping a Persian village much easier. The diplomacy system is akin to a turn-based game, allowing players to offer proposals to another party which they are able to either accept or reject. Each kingdom has a reputation and suffers a penalty for declaring war on a kingdom with a high reputation - making a player's people more likely to rebel and more susceptible to bribery. Diplomatic actions include making war, proposing an alliance or friendship treaty, buying food, exchanging technologies, offering tribute/aid, and forging trade agreements. A ranking system allows all players to gauge the relative military and economic strengths of their allies and enemies, making alliances against the stronger players a natural option. =Cultures= The original game allows players to choose from seven different cultures to command: Japanese, Chinese, Mayans, Persians, Vikings, Greeks, and Normans. Each culture has its own weapons and fighting styles, and can summon its own \\"greater being\\", each with different powers. Fryhtans are fictional beasts that hoard treasure and hold \\"scrolls of power\\", objects that enable players to summon greater beings. They are quite powerful and may attack human kingdoms. Interactive Magic later released a free patch that added three new cultures - the Egyptians, the Mughals and the Zulus - and a new war machine, called the Unicorn. The game was re-released on June 8, 1998 under the name Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries with this patch included. =Loyalty= Villages within each kingdom have taxes collected whenever a village's average loyalty reaches a certain level. The game allows the player to automatically tax a village at any multiple of 10 between 40 and 100. If a village (or any other unit) has loyalty below 30, there is a risk of rebellion. Rebelling units can attack their home village, defect to another tribe, or even form a new kingdom. Normally, a village's loyalty can be determined by a number of factors including the number of races living in the village, the leadership and race of any generals/kings in any forts near the village, availability of jobs and goods, and the player's reputation. The presence of enemy generals/kings can decrease the loyalty of the player's village while friendly ones have the opposite effect. In addition, the player can temporarily increase a village's loyalty beyond the nominal level (the increase is roughly 10 units), granting it funds, and whenever the player taxes the village its loyalty decreases (again by 10 units). The rate at which loyalty returns to normal is determined by the difference between the current loyalty and the nominal loyalty. So, if the tax setting on the game is set at 40 and a village's nominal and current loyalty are at 100, then loyalty will drop very quickly to 30 and increase at a relatively quick pace from 30 to 40, and cycle between those values. However, if the player then sets the tax rate to 100, loyalty will increase from 30/40 to 100 at a gradually decreasing rate, and subsequently cycle between 90 and 100 at a more sedate pace. The player will earn more revenue over a given period of time by setting the tax rate to 40. Most importantly, the player's nominal loyalty is subject to rapid spikes. If the player's reputation drops because civilians are killed, war is declared, a spy is lost, or the village is attacked, then the player will see a sudden drop in current loyalty, which could easily put the player under the rebellion threshold. In the event a king is killed, a replacement king with the same skill in leadership is needed. Otherwise, military and peasant loyalty can drop. The consequences of replacing the king with a less powerful one can be rebellion, susceptibility of villages and military units to spies, and increased risk that soldiers outside of a fort will desert and change sides because of dropped loyalty in response to the replacement king. Training replacements and military leaders is time-consuming and expensive, which may explain why many players rely on military machines. =Raw materials= Raw materials are harvested from mines and then transported to factories. The resources are copper, iron, and clay which can be sold to the surrounding kingdoms. Mines and factories have a maximum capacity of eight workers, and have a limit as to how many raw materials that can be stored. Initially, miners are more efficient than factory workers where a small number of miners should be able to keep an entire factory of eight workers productive. Alternatively, a player could build several factories to process the output from a single full mine. Either way, one should watch raw material stocks and work to remove bottlenecks as they occur. Idle workers in a factory or mine incur an opportunity cost in terms of food they could be producing as peasants. Foreign workers must also be paid wages. Open source project In August 2009, Enlight released the game under the terms of the GNU General Public License and has provided a website at www.7kfans.com for the community. In 2010, the game was ported to the Simple DirectMedia Layer version 1.2. which allows it run on other operating systems such as Linux. On May 19, 2015, the open source project released version 2.14.5. Among other changes and bug fixes, this release brought with it a migration to SDL2 and the return of networked multiplayer with enet. On September 4, 2016, the project released version 2.14.6. This version included basic multiplayer lobby support for both LAN and online matchmaking. The online matchmaking service runs on 7kfans.com and is tied to existing user accounts from the website's forums. Numerous other QoL changes and bugfixes were delivered with the release. Reception =Sales= Commercially, Seven Kingdoms was overshadowed at launch by competing real-time strategy titles such as Age of Empires, Total Annihilation and Dark Reign. Writing for CNET Gamecenter, Allen Rausch reported that the game was \\"buried\\" by the large number of releases in its genre at the time. The game was particularly dwarfed by Age of Empires, according to T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer US, who placed part of the blame for Seven Kingdoms sales on its \\"indifferent ad campaign and weak graphics.\\" However, both Rausch and McDonald noted that Seven Kingdoms had attracted a dedicated fan following by 1999, at which point Rausch wrote that it had sold \\"fairly well\\". In the United States, the game sold roughly 35,000 units by November 1999, according to PC Data. Global sales of Seven Kingdoms, its expansion pack and its sequel surpassed 200,000 units by 2000. =Seven Kingdoms= The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings (though almost all of them belong to its sequel rather than the original). Seven Kingdoms was the finalist for GameSpot's 1997 \\"Best Strategy Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Total Annihilation. The editors wrote, \\"Even in light of fierce competition from this year's other top-notch strategy releases, Seven Kingdoms stands tall as an inventive, enjoyable product destined to be remembered.\\" However, it won the publication's \\"Best Game No One Played\\" award. In a 1999 retrospective, Computer Games Strategy Plus named Seven Kingdoms as a runner-up for its \\"10 Essential Real-time Strategy Games\\" list. The magazine's Steve Bauman wrote, \\"Its combat is nothing to write home about, but few RTS games have a better build-up phase, with a slick visual representation of trade and economy.\\" =Ancient Adversaries= The Ancient Adversaries expansion pack received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to GameRankings.

She was born a commoner, allegedly of Jewish family background. A Hungarian national, she relocated to London after her divorce from the prince, where she is suspected of having acted as a spy for Germany during the 1930s. She developed close connections among the Nazi hierarchy, including Adolf Hitler. She also developed other influential relationships, including with Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, and promoted British support for Germany while living in London from 1932. The British, French and Americans all suspected her of being a spy for the German Government. During the 1930s, she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Nazi Party for her services.Martha Schad, Hitler's Spy Princess: The Extraordinary Life of Princess Stephanie Von Hohenlohe (translated by Angus McGeoch), Sutton: 2004 Fleeing from Britain to San Francisco in 1939 after war was declared, she was put under surveillance by the US government. After the attack on Pearl Harbor she was arrested by the FBI and interned in the United States as an enemy alien. She provided information to the Office of Strategic Services which was used in a 1943 report on the personality of Adolf Hitler. In May 1945 she was released on parole and returned to Germany, where she cultivated influential connections in post-war German society. Early life Stephanie Richter was born in Vienna, Austria, to Ludmilla Kuranda (said to be Jewish) and Johann Sebastian Richter, purported to be a dentist or minor lawyer. She was named after Crown Princess Stephanie of Austria-Hungary. (Note: A 2004 biography by Martha Schad says that Richter was the illegitimate daughter of two Jewish parents.)Schad (2004), Hitler's Spy Princess. Note: Schad says that Richter was the illegitimate daughter of two Jewish parents: her mother was from Prague and her father worked as a moneylender in Vienna. In the Third Reich, her Jewish ancestry was known, but she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Nazi Party for her services. In 1906, Stephanie Richter was enrolled in the ballet school of the Vienna Court Opera. As a young woman, she used her beauty, charm and sophistication to gain an entr√©e to Vienna's high society. In her early twenties, Richter had an affair with the married Archduke Franz Salvator, Prince of Tuscany. He was the son-in-law of Emperor Franz Joseph I through his marriage to Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria. Pregnant with Franz Salvator's child, she persuaded Friedrich Franz von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst (1879-1958), a German prince of the Hohenlohe family, that the baby was his. They married in London on 12 May 1914, giving her the title of \\"princess\\", which she used the rest of her life. Her son was born in Vienna on 5 December 1914, and named Franz Josef. (According to an FBI memo of October 1941, the Hohenlohe family had some doubts about whether the child was theirs, but acknowledged him.) His full name was Franz Josef Rudolf Hans Weriand Max Stefan Anton von Hohenlohe- Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst. Interwar period Princess Stephanie and her husband were divorced in 1920. Later that year in Budapest, he married Hungarian Countess Emanuela Batthy√°ny von N√©met-Ujv√°r, in Budapest on 6 December 1920. They did not have any children. They would escape to Brazil in the closing days of World War II. After the divorce, Princess Stephanie's surname was zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst, as was Austrian custom. Over the years, she always represented herself as a Hohenlohe princess. She lived in Paris until the government forced her out on suspicion of being a spy. She moved to London in 1932, settling at the exclusive Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair, London. Meanwhile, she had developed friendships and sometimes intimate relationships with powerful and influential men, including Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, an Anglo-Irish tycoon who owned the influential Daily Mail and Daily Mirror in London, and Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German Ambassador to Britain in the 1930s. She also cultivated others in the Nazi Party hierarchy. As a princess, she socialized with the British aristocracy, connections that the Nazis believed could be valuable for their new government after they came to power in 1933. Her close friends included Margot Asquith, the widow of the former prime minister H. H. Asquith, Lady Ethel Snowden, the wife of a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lady Londonderry and her husband Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry.Tweedie, Neil and Day, Peter. \\"When Rothermere urged Hitler to invade Romania\\", The Daily Telegraph, (March 1, 2005) After Hitler gained power in Germany in 1933, MI6 circulated a report stating that the French secret service had discovered documents in the princess's flat in Paris that ordered her to persuade Lord Rothermere to campaign for the return to Germany of territory ceded to Poland at the end of First World War. She was to receive ¬£300,000 (the equivalent of ¬£13 million today) if she succeeded. Princess Stephanie received financial support from Rothermere, an early admirer of Hitler, and in the early 1930s, he advocated an alliance with Germany. In the 1930s, he paid Princess Stephanie an annual retainer of ¬£5,000 (the equivalent of ¬£200,000 today) to promote Germany and to develop support for it among her influential connections. He also hoped that she would introduce him to Nazi inner circles. As war approached, Rothermere pushed for British rearmament, their association deteriorated and Rothermere stopped paying her. Princess Stephanie took him to court, alleging in a lawsuit that he had promised the retainer for life. She lost the case. During visits to Germany, she had become closely acquainted with members of the Nazi hierarchy, including Adolf Hitler, who called her his \\"dear princess\\". She developed a close friendship with Hermann G√∂ring, and Heinrich Himmler declared her an \\"honorary Aryan\\". In a 1938 MI6 report, British intelligence said of her, \\"She is frequently summoned by the F√ºhrer who appreciates her intelligence and good advice. She is perhaps the only woman who can exercise any influence on him\\".(That was part of a release of MI6 records in 2005 under a declassification of documents.) In England, Princess Stephanie acted as a courier, passing secret messages among high-ranking British men who were sympathetic to the Nazi regime. In 1937 she arranged for Lord Halifax to travel to Germany and meet G√∂ring. She was also instrumental in arranging the visit that year to Germany of Edward, Duke of Windsor, and his wife Wallis, Duchess of Windsor. In 1937 Princess Stephanie began an affair with Fritz Wiedemann, a personal aide to Hitler. When Wiedemann was appointed to the post of German Consul-General in San Francisco, she joined him in the United States in late 1937 and stayed for a time, returning to Europe the following year. In 1938, the Nazis confiscated the property of Austrian Jews, including the Leopoldskron castle in Salzburg, which had been owned by theatre director Max Reinhardt. It was there that she received and entertained Walter Runciman, the author of the Runciman Report, which argued for handing Sudetenland over to Germany. He is reported to have spent several delightful days there. Some reported that G√∂ring gave Princess Stephanie the property; other sources say that she leased it or was charged by G√∂ring with developing the estate as a guest house for prominent artists and to serve as a reception facility to Hitler's Berghof home. Second World War Princess Stephanie returned to Britain in 1939, but after war was declared later that year, she left the country for fear of being arrested as a German spy. She travelled to the United States, returning to her former lover Fritz Wiedemann, then German Consul in San Francisco. On her arrival, the United States government placed her under security surveillance by the FBI. In March 1941, she was detained for several days by US immigration authorities. She made up to Major Lemuel B. Schofield, the Director of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington, DC. He put her up in the Raleigh Hotel, where he also lived, and the two carried on an affair that lasted several months. She then lived with her mother and son in Alexandria, Virginia. In October 1941, the FBI prepared a memo describing her as \\"extremely intelligent, dangerous and clever,\\" and claiming that as a spy, she was \\"worse than ten thousand men\\".\\"October 28, 1941 Memorandum on Stephanie von Hohenlohe for U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\" from ?, Safe files, Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, hosted at Marist University, accessed 18 May 2013 Summarizing what was known about her, it recommended that her deportation not be further delayed and noted that the British and the French, in addition to the United States intelligence community, suspected her of being a spy for Germany. She continued to stay in the US. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the formal entry of the US into World War II, the FBI arrested Princess Stephanie, interning her at a facility in Philadelphia and later at a Texas camp for enemy aliens. On January 10, 1942, the enemy alien hearing board in Philadelphia recommended to Attorney General Biddle that she be interned for the duration of the war, based on an interview the previous month.Wire service, ‚ÄúInternment Sought Of Mystery Princess‚Äù, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 11 January 1942, Volume 48, page 3.

Later life In the postwar era, Princess Stephanie returned to Germany, where she established new, influential connections. She worked with media executives such as Henri Nannen of Stern news magazine and Axel Springer, the owner of the Axel Springer AG publishing company. For the latter, she secured interviews with US Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.Schad (2011), Hitler's Spy Princess She died in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1972 and is buried there.

Set in fictional Hick County, the game revolves around completing trips between cities, delivering goods, and competing in races while at the helm of a semi truck. The game is available on GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC. It met with middling critical and commercial reception, due to repetitive gameplay, dated graphics, and lackluster sound. The game uses Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild\\" as its theme song. The sequel is Big Mutha Truckers 2. A different game of the same name was developed by Italian company Raylight Studios and released for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. The game's plot revolves around one of four available characters and their quest to inherit the family business. With plans to retire from the family business, Ma' Jackson challenges her four children, Cletus, Earl, Rawkus, and Bobbie-Sue, to a \\"Trial by Truckin\\". She gives each sibling 60 days in which to make deliveries to various cities in Hick State County, with the company going to the sibling with the most money in the end. Gameplay Big Mutha Truckers is primarily a racing game, in the same vein as 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker. Players spend the majority of their time on the road, navigating the highways between the game's six cities: Salt Sea City, Capital City, Greenback, Skeeter's Creek, Smokestack Heights, and Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated. The player will earn most of their money through trade, shipping goods from cell phones to beer, with additional opportunities from mini-games and challenge races. Every city features three locations: a garage, a bar, and a store. The garage allowed players to repair damage, refuel, switch trailers to carry different kinds of cargo, buy upgrades to improve their rig, or design custom logos for their truck. In the bar the player can find tips on where to buy and sell certain cargo, and a loan shark. The store allows the player to buy and sell goods, with prices varying by town. When visiting Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated, the bar and store are replaced by visits to Ma Jackson. On the road, the player can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This money can be multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. Law enforcement and biker gangs are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player if they attack them by mistake. Any cop will pursue and capture a player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, it is a significant blow to the player's cash. Every cop can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken away from the truck. Occasionally, the player will be asked to accomplish a side-mission when they visit a bar. These point-to-point races are good for cash if the player can complete them. Reception Big Mutha Truckers received a mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 66.41% and 62 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 65.36% and 63 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 65.35% and 59 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 56% and 48 out of 100 for the DS version; 55.80% and 61 out of 100 for the PC version; and 50% for the Game Boy Advance version. GameSpot critic Alex Navarro gave the game a 6.2 out of 10 rating, noting that while it \\"earnestly tries to be a fun game\\", flaws in the presentation and a lack of varied gameplay lead to a game that \\"as a full-on purchase ... just doesn't measure up.\\" Similar complaints about the game's commerce model came from Andy Mahood of GameSpy, who wrote that \\"no matter how much you dress it up ... this lather-rinse-repeat cycle can turn stale after only a few hours of play.\\" References External links 2002 video games Eutechnyx games Game Boy Advance games GameCube games Nintendo DS games PlayStation 2 games Trade simulation games Truck racing video games Windows games Xbox games Video games developed in Italy Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games set in Nevada Video games set in the Las Vegas Valley Destination Software games ","title":"Big Mutha Truckers"},{"id":"4298474","title":"Who Pays the Ferryman?"},{"id":"4298484","text":"Colourized version of the above photo Adelaide Helen Grant Sinclair, (January 16, 1900 - November 20, 1982) was a Canadian public servant.

The prison also has a medium security unit that houses medium to minimum security inmates and is classified as Level 3. Until the 2011 abolition of the death penalty in Illinois,Smith, Matt.\\"Illinois abolishes death penalty.\\" CNN. March 9, 2011. the prison housed male death row inmates, but had no execution chamber. Inmates were executed at the Tamms Correctional Center. Although the capacity of the prison is 2172, it has an average daily population of approximately 2000 inmates. In May 2008, Governor Rod Blagojevich proposed to shut down the Pontiac facility, with a phase-out plan to take place from January through February 2009. The inmate population would be transferred to the Thomson facility, a newly built maximum security prison, which is also equipped to house segregated inmates. Illinois has since sold Thomson to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Pontiac facility is one of the largest employers in the Livingston County community. Governor Pat Quinn, elected in 2008, cancelled plans to close Pontiac Correctional Center in March 2009 after taking office.Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability History to 1931 The prison was operated as a boys' reform school from 1872 to 1893. It was formally established as the State Reformatory for youths after that. Among its early detainees was Charles Hair, a Cherokee convicted at age 12 of intent to assault an officer, as he was picked up in an armed raid by law offices in November 1892 raid at the fort of Ned Christie, also Cherokee. Christie had been declared an outlaw after being wrongly accused of killing a federal marshal in 1887, and was killed in the raid. Hair was held in Illinois for three years.Devon A. Mihesuah, 2018, Ned Christie, Chapter 6 When the prison was expanded to house an adult population, the buildings of the former reform school were used as the administrative offices. Two cell houses were constructed. One was a 4-tier cell house holding 296 cells, each of which measured 8'3\\" x 7' x 8'. The other was 5 tiers, housing 500 cells measuring 8'x 5'x 8'. The cells had iron bars in the front and contained a cot or spring bed, a stool and locker. In 1929, there were 1,405 inmates and 57 guards, making the ratio approximately 1 guard to 25 inmates.\\"State Reformatory: Pontiac, Illinois\\", Handbook of American Prisons, 1929. In 1931, an additional cell house with 440 cells on 5 tiers was built. In this cell house, two men were assigned to each 8'x10'x8' cell, sharing a bunk bed, a cabinet, a desk, and outlet for a radio. With the new cell houses, the prison population grew to 2,504 inmates with 150 guards, or approximately 1 guard per 17 inmates. The prison housed 2,504 inmates (1,959 white, 535 black, 10 other).\\"State Reformatory: Pontiac, Illinois\\". Handbook of American Prisons, 1931 =Rules and Regulations= The inmates were allowed to smoke in their cells at specified times. Relatives were allowed to visit once a month on any day except Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and holidays.State Reformatory: Pontiac, Illinois. Handbook of American Prisons,1929. Twice a month, inmates were allowed to write letters: one to a friend and one to a parent. A married prisoner was permitted to write every week. The inmates could buy tobacco, candy and toiletries weekly and could receive newspapers and magazines from the publisher.State Reformatory:Pontiac, Illinois. Handbook of American Prisons. =Punishments= The loss of prisoner privileges for periods of 10 to 30 days was the most common type of punishment. Inmates were put in certain confinement cells with nothing but a slice of bread to eat every morning for 3 to 8 days, for worse violations. This form of punishment was stopped. In the 21st century, inmates are disciplined in many forms for known violations of laws or rules of the institution or department, for which they receive tickets. They may be restricted in yard time, from using audio visual items, or from purchasing items at the commissary. Inmates may also be put on a 72-hour property restrictions, confined to their cells, for instances such as having unauthorized materials or contraband, or assaulting staff or other inmates. Riots On April 23, 1973, a brawl broke out at Pontiac involving 100 inmates using homemade knives, cleaning utensils, and metal trays as weapons in the mess hall. By the time guards fired tear gas to suppress the violence, two inmates had been stabbed and killed. According to Time Magazine, this fight had been sparked by competition among members of rival Chicago gangs who were imprisoned. On July 22, 1978, a riot erupted that involved more than 1,000 inmates and resulted in one of the deadliest riots in Illinois prison history. The riot began around 9:45 in the morning, when 600 prisoners were returning to the cell house on the north end of the prison from the recreational yard. Armed with shanks, prisoners attacked officers inside the cell house. According to investigators, prison gangs directed the attack to challenge Warden Thaddeus Pinkney. Soon the local and state police arrived and fired eight rounds of tear gas into the prison yard. Prisoners set buildings on fire, causing other prisoners to get involved. After many hours, the troops got all inmates back into their cells. Lieutenant William Thomas and two correctional officers, Robert Conkle and Stanley Cole, were killed; three correctional officers, Danny Dill, Dale Walker and Sharon Pachet, were injured. The warden put a \\"deadlock\\" system into effect until October 16, 1978. Prisoners were not allowed to leave their cells for any reason. Their meals were brought to them; all recreational time and work assignments were cancelled. The prisoners were not allowed to shower until October. Family visits were banned until October 14, and they were not allowed to make phone calls to their families until September 30. The officials of the prison began a renewed search of prisoners for weapons on October 2 and ended October 13. The prisoners filed a complaint in the district court on August 31 stating the \\"deadlock\\" was longer than was needed to restore order and was having adverse effects on the prisoners' mental and physical health. The district judge decided to wait until after the \\"shakedown\\" of weapons search to make any decisions. After the shakedown, on November 3, the court ordered Pontiac Correctional Center to restore the family visitation hours and phone privileges as they were before the riot, as well as the meals, exercise and work times. The court also required the prison to provide two hours of yard recreation a week to the prisoners. Because of this riot, the prison instituted a policy of moving only a few inmates at a time in a line. As 1997, prisoners in the maximum security unit are kept in their cell 24 hours a day, with exception of days when they are allowed limited time for yard recreation, use of the law library, showers, and visits. By 2008, a general population of prisoners had been reintroduced to Pontiac Correctional Center. Inmates who are not in segregation status are given more time out of their cells, including social time on rec yards, in the gym, and at dining times. Protective custody and inmates from the medium-security unit may obtain jobs within the prison, ranging from cellhouse porter to lawn care or vehicle maintenance. In addition, inmates of all confinement statuses may participate in mental health and medical \\"groups\\". Church services are held at the center, and the protective custody unit has its own inmate choir. Recent assaults In January 2013, an officer working in the Protective Custody unit of Pontiac CC was attacked and severely injured by an inmate; the officer was hospitalized. The inmate was convicted on charges of aggravated battery and sentenced to 20 years in state prison. This sentence is running concurrent to the 85-year sentence which the inmate had earlier received for armed robbery and murder in Cook County. In March 2015, officers received a tip that an inmate in the North Cellhouse had a homemade weapon in his cell and had threatened to use it against staff. The prison's Tactical Team was mobilized after the inmate refused to comply with orders to put on restraints for a cell search. When the team entered the cell and attempted to restrain the inmate, he stabbed 3 officers multiple times on the hands, arms, and legs. The officers were treated at an outside hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. In the summer of 2016, an officer was escorting an inmate to a new cell in the East Cellhouse. The inmate had justbeen released from segregation status to general population. When the officer went to key open the cell door to let the inmate in, the inmate attacked him, punching him in the face. Tower officers alerted other staff, who subdued the inmate. The officer was treated at a to local hospital and treated for his injuries. As of February 2017, the officer, who has suffered brain injury from the incident, has yet to return to work. On August 21, 2016, an inmate punched a correctional lieutenant, starting a fight that involved six employees and five inmates. It resulted in four correctional officers (2 male, 2 female) and two lieutenants (1 female, 1 male) being treated for injuries, including possible concussions. According to Joe Lewis, a correctional officer and union official at the Pontiac facility, other inmate violence against employees was occurring. He said that the prison administration was ignoring policies to keep workers safe, or substituting ineffective practices. Illinois Department of Corrections spokeswoman Nicole Wilson disputed Lewis's statement, saying, > \\"The events that led to this incident do not appear to be the result of a > lack of policy or a breakdown in existing policies but rather a failure to > follow workplace safety procedures already in place, DOC's investigation > will include why procedures weren't followed and how future incidents can be > prevented.\\" Both the staff and AFSCME (employees' union) denied that employees had violated any procedure. The IDOC and the Governors office had not identified the policy that was violated. As of January 2017, the last of the injured staff members returned to work. The inmates involved were successful in getting in-house department discipline dismissed. The Livingston County State's attorney is pursuing criminal charges against the inmates involved. Those inmates will begin arrangements in March 2017.http://www.week.com/story/34915819/charges-to-be-filed-against-pontiac- correctional-center-inmates On February 11, 2017, an inmate in the Mental Health Unit attacked an officer at Pontiac CC. The inmate had recently been moved from segregation in the unit to its general population. While being escorted in a line to the inmate dining room, the inmate, who is mentally ill, punched the officer in the face. The inmate bit and hit other staff as they attempted to restrain him. The officer was treated for injuries and released from a local hospital. On February 12, 2017, less than 16 hours after the assault noted above, an inmate stabbed an officer in the side of the head/temple area in Property. The institution had been placed on a level 4 lockdown following the previous night's incident. Staff had been ordered to continue some normal movement, which included moving inmates to and from the property building to prepare for transfers. When the general population inmates were packing out, one inmate took the opportunity to stab an officer in the side of the head. The injured officer along with his lieutenant and two other officers managed to subdue the inmate while an emergency code was called. Responding staff removed both the inmate and the injured officer from the area. The officer was treated and released from a local hospital. Following this incident, the facility was placed on a Level One Lockdown. Proposed prison closing In May 2008 the governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, announced his intention to close Pontiac CC by February 2009 and to move about half the inmates to a prison in Thomson, Illinois. Many residents of Pontiac opposed the plan, fearing \\"570 jobs in this central Illinois town would be lost.\\" The prison is the second-largest employer in Livingston County. Citizens gathered together to hold rallies seeking the support of the governor. On September 15 a joint meeting in Chicago and Springfield was held on the issue, for voting by the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. At this meeting 9 of 12 people voted to keep the prison open. While Governor Blagojevich would have made the final decision, he would have taken this vote into consideration. On September 16 employees of Pontiac Correctional Center filed a lawsuit stating \\"the state does not have a right to close the facility because it has budgeted money to run the prison through June 2009.\\" Further, they said that \\"Gov. Rod Blagojevich and the Illinois Department of Corrections cannot close the prison because funding was provided in the 2008-09 budget, which was passed by the Illinois General Assembly and signed into law by Blagojevich.\\" On September 17, an independent commission of state lawmakers rejected closing the prison, despite the claims by the Department of Corrections that such action would save money in the next year's budget. Pat Quinn, lieutenant governor of Illinois since 2003, assumed the governorship in January 2009 after Blagojevich was impeached for corruption charges. (He was later convicted and imprisoned.) On March 12, 2009, Governor Quinn cancelled plans to close Pontiac Correctional Center. Units =Medium-Security Unit= This unit, commonly referred to as \\"the farm,\\" was once a working farm that cultivated crops and raised livestock to produce much of the food consumed by the prison. This unit is classified as Level 3 and houses offenders that are medium- to minimum-security inmates. =Maximum-Security Unit= This unit is classified as Level 1. It contains offenders who need to be segregated and are limited in their privileges. The maximum security unit also houses maximum-security inmates in General Population status, and high-aggression protective-custody inmates. North Condemned/Administrative Detention Until the abolition of the death penalty in Illinois in 2011, this unit housed death row inmates. This unit has been renamed as North Administrative Detention. It now houses inmates who are believed to be gang chiefs and too much of security risks to be houses in the general population. North Segregation This unit is the state's main Segregation housing unit for high-aggression inmates who have broken facility rules. Such violations include assaulting staff or inmates, possessing contraband, escape attempts, etc. East Cell House This unit holds many different classifications of inmates, including Segregation Release, General Population, and Protective Custody. South Protective Custody Unit The state's primary Protective Custody Unit. Some of these inmates are former death row offenders. The unit houses between 300-400 inmates. South Mental Health Unit This unit provides psychiatric and psychological mental health services for offenders who are sentenced to be within the correctional system for a longer period of time and have a segregated status. These offenders are diagnosed as chronically mentally ill; diagnoses of the inmates have included schizophrenia, psychotic, and bipolar or major affective disorder. West Cell House This unit is a segregation unit for low-aggression inmates.

Description Instituted on 18 October 1938, the medal was awarded to participants in the occupations of Sudetenland in October 1938 and Czechoslovakia in March 1939. The medal was awarded to all German State officials and members of the German Wehrmacht and SS who entered the Sudetenland on 18 October 1938, and to Sudeten Nazis who had worked for union with Germany. Later a special bar for attachment to the ribbon was introduced for participation in the occupation of the remnants of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939, and to others who rendered valuable support. Last awarded on 31 December 1940, a total of 1,162,617 medals and 134,563 bars were bestowed. The wearing of Nazi era awards was banned in 1945. The Sudetenland medal was not among those awards reauthorized for official wear by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. Design The medal was circular and similar in appearance as the Anschluss Medal, the reverse only differed in the date. It was designed by Professor Richard Klein. On the obverse a man holding the Nazi flag stands on a podium bearing the eagle emblem of the Third Reich. He assists a second man onto the podium, whose right arm bears a broken shackle. This symbolizes the joining of the area to the Reich. On the reverse is the inscription date \\"1. Oktober 1938\\" (1 October 1938). The date is surrounded with the words \\"Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein F√ºhrer\\" (One People, One Nation, One Leader). The medal was die-struck and high in detail, with a bronze finish. It was suspended from a striped black, red, black ribbon and white outer stripes, the colors of the Sudetenland. Prague Castle Bar For those who had participated in both the occupation of the Sudetenland and the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia on 15 March 1939, a bronze Castle Bar (), was approved on 1 May 1939. This bar featured the Prague Castle on the obverse with two triangular prongs in the back, which held it on the ribbon of the prior awarded Sudetenland medal. The bar, like the medal, was die-struck and high in detail, with a bronze finish.

Authors went back and forth on the question, considering it either as a basal dinosaur, or as a \\"thecodont\\" or other basal archosaur. In 2000, Peter Galton noted that it lacks dinosaurian characteristics and was probably a rauisuchian more closely related to rauisuchids,Galton, P.M. (2000).

Born in Koprivshtitsa in a wealthy family, he studied in his hometown and then in Plovdiv between 1864 and 1867 and founded the Zora enlightenment society in 1867. He continued his education in Galatasaray High School in Istanbul, but was forced to return to Koprivshtitsa because of illness. He worked in Edirne as a telegraph operator in 1873 and was then a station master near Pazardzhik, where he engaged in cultural and educational activities. Kableshkov returned to Koprvishtitsa in the beginning of 1876 and committed himself to revolutionary work. He was assigned the head of the local revolutionary committee in Koprishtitsa and deputy-apostle of the Panagyurishte revolutionary district. He was the first to proclaim the April Uprising on 20 April 1876 and is the author of the famous Bloody Letter to the Panagyurishte revolutionary district. Kableshkov was the head of the military council in Koprivshtitsa and led a cheta (band, detachment) together with Panayot Volov, with which he went round the nearby villages. After the uprising was suppressed by the Ottoman authorities, Kableshkov fled in the interior of Stara Planina with a small group. He was captured near Troyan and was afterwards tortured in the Lovech and Veliko Tarnovo prisons. Todor Kableshkov eventually committed suicide in the Gabrovo police office at the age of 25. Todor Kableshkov is remembered as one of the most courageous Bulgarian revolutionaries especially considering the young age at which he entered the revolutionary movement. His home house in Koprivshtitsa is now turned into a museum and a monument was built on the place he decided to start the rebellion.

It is a name used by linguists discussing the languages, not the speakers themselves. The first three, which may be co-dialects, are spoken in adjacent areas in the western part of Baucau District, along the north coast. Naueti is used on the south coast of eastern Viqueque District, surrounded by speakers of Makasae and Makalero. Some Midiki speakers near Ossu refer to their language as Osomoko. Except perhaps for Naueti, the Kawaimina languages are members of the Timor‚ÄìBabar family of Austronesian languages. While structurally the languages are Malayo-Polynesian, their vocabulary, particularly that of Naueti, derives mostly from Papuan languages. In this they are similar to Makasae and Habun; none of these languages are easy to classify as either Austronesian or Papuan. The languages are noted for both archaisms and unusual innovations, including vowel harmony and aspirated and glottalized consonants in their sound-systems.

Background LINC was originally developed as a short-cut (or template) by two programmers to reproduce and automate the production of computer applications for different companies, that had similar requirements and specifications. The requirements were similar, because the companies followed a common, generic, business model. That is, these businesses dealt with \\"commodities\\", or \\"parts\\", or \\"suppliers\\", or \\"customers\\" (named \\"components\\" in LINC terminology). These were \\"manufactured\\", or \\"assembled\\", or \\"purchased\\", or \\"sold\\" (actions termed \\"events\\" in LINC terminology). These components and events were the \\"interface specifications\\" or \\"ispecs\\" and contained the database definitions, screen designs, and business rules of the application system. LIRC (Logic and Information Report Compiler) was part of LINC and was developed to allow the programmer to produce reports (e.g. \\"purchase orders\\", \\"invoices\\", \\"credit notes\\", \\"consignment notes\\", \\"bills of sale\\"). The information in these reports were accessed by using various user-defined views of these components and events called \\"profiles\\". Because reports run as a separate task (as a separate thread of execution) they could also be written to run as a background process; that is, it could put itself to sleep for a period of time or until woken, to perform some processing, then put itself to sleep again. Part of the reason for the introduction of this new terminology was to make the system easier for programmers. It isolated them from a lot of the underlying technology. (Similarly, different names were intentionally used for control structures: DO.WHEN rather than IF or LOOP, and LOOK.UP or DETERMINE rather than READ, with the OPEN and CLOSE statements generated automatically.) What allowed LINC to make programmers much more efficient and the application systems they produced easier to read and maintain, and differentiated it from being simply yet another third generation high level language, was LINC's assumption, use of, and total reliance on all of the facilities available, and packaged, with the Burroughs computer for which it was written: operating system, job control language, COBOL programming language, database management system, network definition, user terminal, etc. (See also \\"history\\" below.) From version 11, its character changed. Where LINC (and LIRC) specifications had previously been held in source-code files, they were now held in a database (designed and developed using the LINC 4GL) and subject to rigorous automatic validation. The new LINC-based system in which specifications were stored was named LINC interactive or LINC Development Environment (LDE). Extensive reliance on terminal \\"screen painting\\" (i.e. \\"mocking\\"-up a CRT data-entry screen) was used to assist system definition. e.g. to define a component's database attributes (name, length, alpha(numeric), validation rules, etc., and for defining report layouts). In the early 1990s, a new PC-based tool for developing LINC specifications was released, the LINC Development Assistant (LDA). LDA was written in a mixture of Smalltalk and C++ rather than the LINC 4GL (the latter of which was not intended to run on a personal computer). From version 17, it was intended that all development be done with LDA. Now LINC is known as Unisys Enterprise Application Environment (EAE) and can generate COBOL code for Burroughs & Sperry mainframes, Microsoft Windows, and various Unix and Linux platforms. It will also generate GUI front-end clients in * Java * Visual Basic 6 clients * Active Server Pages * Web services for Microsoft IIS * ASP.NET * VB.NET in addition to compiling generated code and deploying databases to correspond with the specification. Databases supported include Burroughs DMSII, Sperry RDMS, Oracle database and Microsoft SQL Server. Recent Update: Unisys is replacing EAE with Unisys Agile Business Suite (AB Suite). The LDL language is promoted to LDL+, with new object-oriented features. The Development environment makes use of the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. The Model Driven approach is extended with a UML based Class Diagram integrated with all the source code of the solution, in such a way that a round trip update is achieved. Changes in the Business Rules can result in changes in the UML representation and vice versa. AB Suite 4.0 makes use of Visual Studio 2012 and integrates with Team Foundation Server 2012. AB Suite generates to either a .NET environment or a ClearPath MCP environment. With AB Suite a developer has to write less code than in a traditional C# or Java environment. =History= LINC was originally developed by two New Zealand computer programmers (Gil Simpson and Peter Hoskins) while working in Saudi Arabia in the early 1980s. It was first developed exclusively for operation with a single model of Burroughs computer system comprising a totally integrated system of: * B1000 hardware, * MCP operating system, * COBOL application programming language, * WFL job control language, * DMS II database management system, * NDL Network Definition Language * MT983/ET1100 CRT (user terminal), etc. The LINC system created 3rd GL COBOL (application), DMSII (database definition), NDLII (network description), and WFL (job control) source code. The job control statements were themselves subsequently run to compile the other elements and create an integrated system of database, applications, and user terminal network. Burroughs purchased rights to sell the product in 1982, while product development was retained by the original inventors. An early requirement was to extend the product for use with the Burroughs mid-range and large scale computing platforms. After Burroughs merged with Sperry Corporation to form Unisys, the language was extended to be used on Sperry's UNIVAC 1100/2200 series machines also. Subsequently a New Zealand development centre was set up in Christchurch by Gil Simpson to develop the product. Ownership was later on transferred to Unisys and the product and mainframe computer centre resources transitioned to Unisys ACUS, the \\"Australian Centre for Unisys Software\\" in Sydney Australia. Gil Simpsons Christchurch team went on to create the Jade language/database that could import and run LINC code on commodity hardware. LINC itself is (was) supported on the following platforms: * ClearPath A-Series * ClearPath 2200 * Unix SUN Solaris * Unix IBM RS6000 * Unix HP9000 * Unix Sequent * Unixware * Windows Server Development work was by ACUS Unisys, but was transitioned from ACUS to an Indian outsourcing operation in early 2008. Eventually, the product was sold to over clients worldwide. Strengths * It provides an intuitive and easy-to-understand interface to the Burroughs DMS and COBOL programming. * As it has been modernised to support different platforms, it facilitates migration between platforms and databases. * By confining a specification in a database, the entire design can be kept in a single design and development environment. * Once generated, the code is absolutely consistent with its design specification. ** A client interface is always consistent with a system generated at the same time. ** The system's database access code is always consistent with the system's database tables. Weaknesses Principally, LINC fails to compete against myriad turnkey systems readily available from many other sources (especially IBM). The cost of purchasing and customising an existing product (e.g. the Hogan retail banking system) is perceived as less expensive/risk than using LINC to create, from scratch, an entire business system with all its rules. Other weaknesses arise mostly from its dependence and basis on Burroughs DMS and COBOL, which differ greatly from other computing platforms. * People entering the industry or from a Unix / Windows background may struggle to adjust to this different paradigm. * Functionality can be limited by the need to support multiple platforms. You can't use optimal Oracle structures or queries if the mainframe platforms don't support them.

It is based on a partial skeleton from the latest Albian-earliest Cenomanian-age Lower and Upper Cretaceous Belle Fourche Member of the Frontier Formation of Fremont County, Wyoming, USA. History Armor plates and teeth In 1905, Samuel Wendell Williston described FMNH UR88, a partial armored dinosaur skeleton consisting of a maxilla fragment, seven cervical and two dorsal vertebrae, part of a sacrum and both ilia, caudal vertebrae, parts of the scapulae, both humeral heads, portions of an ulna and both radii, a metacarpal, partial tibia, metatarsal, and armor including a shoulder spine and neck ring.Carpenter, K., and Kirkland, J.I. (1998). Review of Lower and middle Cretaceous ankylosaurs from North America. In: Lucas, S.G., Kirkland, J.I., and Estep, J.W. (eds.). Lower and Middle Cretaceous Terrestrial Ecosystems. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 14:249-270. The specimen was in poor condition, as it had eroded from a slope and been walked on by cattle. Ankylosaurians being very poorly known, Williston compared his new genus to Stegosaurus, and the armor to that of Glyptodon; like that mammal, Stegopelta had a fused section of armor (in its case over the pelvis). Roy Lee Moodie redescribed it in 1910, and considered it to be close to, if not the same as, Ankylosaurus. The genus fell into obscurity. Walter Coombs synonymized it with the more famous but equally poorly known Nodosaurus in his 1978 redescription of the Ankylosauria. It was reinstated as a valid genus by Ken Carpenter and James Kirkland (1998), who recognized it as having distinct vertebral and armor characteristics. Tracy Ford took this farther in 2000, assigning it to a new subfamily in Ankylosauridae based on armor characteristics, which he called Stegopeltinae. Also included was Glyptodontopelta.Ford, T.L.

New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 17:157-176. This has not been generally accepted, but most recent reviews have accepted Stegopelta as a distinct genus with uncertain affinities.Carpenter, K. (2001). Phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosauria.

In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria (second edition). University of California Press:Berkeley, 363-392. Paleobiology Because it is so poorly known, at this point all that can be said about the habits and life of Stegopelta is that it was a slow quadrupedal herbivore that fed low to the ground and relied on its armor for defense. Its armor included a fused region over the sacrum, and shoulder spines that may have been split, as seen in Edmontonia.

He was on leave during World War II as head of the Research and Analysis Branch of the Office of Strategic Services. He was a specialist on the diplomacy of the periods 1870‚Äì1900 and 1937‚Äì1941. He edited many books, including a series on European history, a large-scale reference book, and a university textbook. Early life Born in South Boston, Massachusetts, he was the second of three sons of recent German immigrants, Charles Rudolph and Johanna Rockenbach. His elder brother, Rudolf Ernest Langer, became a mathematician and his younger brother, Walter Charles Langer, a psychoanalyst. When William was only three, his father died unexpectedly, leaving the family in difficult circumstances. Nevertheless, his mother, who supported the family by working as a dressmaker, made education a priority for her children. Education and career After studying at the Boston Latin School, Langer attended Harvard University. Langer was fluent in German, and taught German at Worcester Academy while furthering his own education with courses on international relations at Clark University. His job and education were interrupted by military service World War I. After the war, he returned to his studies and obtained his Ph.D. in 1923. In 1921 he married Susanne Katherina Langer (n√©e Knauth) who became a noted philosopher. They had two sons together before divorcing in 1942. He taught modern European history at Clark University for four years before accepting an assistant professorship at Harvard. In 1936 Langer became the first to hold the Archibald Coolidge chair. Langer was remembered at Harvard especially for his History 132 course on modern European history, History 157 on the Ottoman Empire, and the graduate seminars held at his home. He also taught at the Harvard Extension School. With the help of other scholars during the 1930s, Langer completely revised the Epitome of History by German Scholar Karl Ploetz. Langer's massive work was published in 1940 under the title An Encyclopedia of World History. Its fifth edition (1972) is the last to be edited by Langer. Peter N. Stearns and thirty other prominent historians edited the sixth edition, published in 2001. Stearns paid tribute to Langer's great achievement in the introduction to the new edition. Later career In 1957, Langer urged historians to expand their insights with techniques from modern psychology. (review of ) =War service= Langer was an enlisted man in the United States Army Chemical Service in World War I, and saw combat in a chemical weapons unit on the Western Front in France. He described the experience in a book he wrote with another man in his company. During World War II, Langer served in the new Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as deputy chief and later chief of the Research and Analysis Branch until the end of the war. In correspondence he was identified as OSS 117, a codename which entered French popular culture in 1949 for an unrelated iconic fictional character of books and film. He was special assistant for intelligence analysis to U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. In 1950 Langer organized the office of National Estimates in the newly established Central Intelligence Agency After the war, Langer returned to academia, but from 1961 to 1977 he served on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Honors William Langer was awarded the Medal for Merit by President Truman in May 1946 in recognition of his wartime service. He was also awarded the Bancroft Prize in 1954. Postwar, both Harvard and Yale University awarded Langer LL.D. degrees as did the University of Hamburg in 1955.

It lived during the Cretaceous. Its fossils were found in the Xinminbao Group near Heishan in Gansu Province in China. These fossils consist of fragmentary material, including dermal spine elements. The genus is occasionally misspelled as \\"Stegosauroides\\". Discovery and species In 1930, Anders Birger Bohlin during the Swedish-Chinese expedition of Sven Hedin excavated fossils at Hui-Hui-Pu, between the Heishan en Ku‚Äôan-t‚Äôai-shan mountain ranges, near Xinminbao, in the west of Gansu. These included two vertebrae of about eleven centimetres in length and a dermal spine base.B. Bohlin, 1953, Fossil reptiles from Mongolia and Kansu. Reports from the Scientific Expedition to the North-western Provinces of China under Leadership of Dr. Sven Hedin. VI. Vertebrate Palaeontology 6. The Sino-Swedish Expedition Publications 37, 113 pp The type species is Stegosaurides excavatus, formally described by Bohlin in 1953. The generic name combines Stegosaurus with the Greek ~eides, \\"-shaped\\", in reference to the presumed similarity with the vertebrae of Stegosaurus. The specific name means \\"hollowed out\\" in Latin and refers to two large depressions, one each on either side of the spine base. It is currently considered a nomen dubium as the material is so limited. Phylogeny Bohlin placed Stegosaurides in the Stegosauria. However, later authors often presumed it represented a member of the Ankylosauria, in an indeterminate position.Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., Osm√≥lska, H., & Hilton, Richard P., 2004, The Dinosauria, University of California Press, p. 567 The fossils resemble vertebrae of both groups in having strongly elevated diapophyses, but are more ankylosaur-like in that the neural arch is moderately tall. Uncertainty over the precise age of the Xinminbao Group adds to the difficulty of determining the affinities. Usually it is given as Early Cretaceous when both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs were present, but sometimes as Late Cretaceous when stegosaurs were probably extinct.

It lived in the late Berriasian Stage of the Cretaceous period, approximately 140 myr ago.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to- Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. The genus is based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull, and its classification is based on characteristics of the hips. Discovery and species Cast of the pelvic region In 1855, in a sandstone quarry near B√ºckeburg on the Harrl, a fossil was found of a small dinosaur. Most of its bones were in a poor condition and removed on preparation, leaving two sets of hollow impressions on the plate and counterplate. The two plates do not overlap completely. The hollows, serving as a natural mold, have since been used to produce several casts in gypsum and latex to facilitate the study of the specimen. It was originally part of the collection of Max Ballerstedt preserved in the B√ºckeburg Gymnasium Adolfinum*Hermann Schmidt, 1969, \\"Stenopelix valdensis H. v. Meyer, der kleine Dinosaurier des norddeutschen Wealden\\", Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift 43(3/4): 194-198 but was in 1976 moved to the Georg-August- Universit√§t G√∂ttingen where it now resides in the collection of the Geowissenschaftliches Zentrum der Universit√§t G√∂ttingen. In 1857, based on this fossil, Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer named the type species Stenopelix valdensis.*Meyer, H. von, 1857, \\"Beitr√§ge zur n√§heren Kenntis fossiler Reptilien\\", Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Mineralogie, Geologie und Pal√§ontologie 1857: 532‚Äì543 The generic name is derived from Greek stenos, \\"narrow\\", and pelyx, \\"pelvis\\". The specific name refers to the Wealden Formation. The holotype, GZG 741/2 (earlier GPI 741-1, 2), found in the Obernkirchen Sandstein Formation, consists of the impressions of an almost complete skeleton, lacking the skull and the neck. Classification Hypothetical restoration The classification of Stenopelix is controversial and has ever been problematic because of the lacking skull. Prior to the 1960s, it was often assigned to some ornithopod group. In 1974 Teresa Marya≈Ñska suggested it to be a pachycephalosaur, one of the oldest known, due to the apparent exclusion of the pubis from the acetabulum, and the presence of strong caudal ribs. Peter Galton in 1982 showed that the \\"pubis\\" was actually part of the acetabulum, and the so-called \\"caudal ribs\\" were sacral ribs. The curvature of the ischium and absence of an obturator foramen were not characteristics seen in other pachycephalosaurs. Galton concluded Stenopelix to be ceratopian.*H.-D. Sues and P. M. Galton, 1982, \\"The systematic position of Stenopelix valdensis (Reptilia: Ornithischia) from the Wealden of north- western Germany\\", Palaeontographica Abteilung A 178(4-6): 183-190 However, exact cladistic analyses by Paul Sereno have resulted in a position in the Pachycephalosauria. But paleontologists Richard J. Butler and Robert M. Sullivan nonetheless view the species as being Marginocephalia incertae sedis, rejecting the presumed synapomorphies with the Pachycephalosauria as incorrect identifications or lacking cogency because of a possible presence in ceratopsian groups.*R. J. Butler and R. M. Sullivan, 2009, \\"The phylogenetic position of Stenopelix valdensis from the Lower Cretaceous of Germany and the early fossil record of Pachycephalosauria\\", Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 54(1): 21-34 In 2011, cladistic analysis performed by Butler et al. showed that Stenopelix is a basal member of the Ceratopsia, and its sister taxon is Yinlong. Paleobiology Stenopelix was a small herbivorous animal. The preserved rump and tail have a combined length of just 97 centimetres; the femur is fourteen centimetres long. The species can be distinguished by several details of the pelvis. The shaft part of the ilium uniformly tapers ending in a rounded point. The shaft of the ischium is thickest in the middle and there shows a distinctive kink.

On 18 September 2015, the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East elected Mar Gewargis Sliwa to succeed the late Mar Dinkha IV as the head of the Church. On 27 September 2015, he was formally consecrated and enthroned as Catholicos-Patriarch. Early life Warda Daniel Sliwa was born on 23 November 1941, in Habbaniya, Iraq, to Daniel and Mariam Sliwa. In 1964, he matriculated from the School of Education, a federated college of the University of Baghdad. Following this, he taught English in various schools in Iraq for the next thirteen years. During a visit to the United States he was called by the Catholicos-Patriarch, Mar Dinkha IV, to serve the Assyrian Church of the East in the ordained ministry. After training in the rites and theology of the Church, he was ordained to the diaconate on 13 April 1980, and on 8 June 1980 he was ordained to the priesthood. Warda Daniel Sliwa continued to serve and train within the Church, until he was nominated by Catholicos-Patriarch Mar Dinkha IV and the hierarchy of the Assyrian Church of the East to assume the rank of Metropolitan for Baghdad and all Iraq. Thus, he would eventually succeed the Metropolitan Mar Yosip Khnanisho, who had died in 1977. On Pentecost Sunday, 7 June 1981, Rev. Sliwa was consecrated as Metropolitan of Baghdad and all Iraq by Mar Dinkha IV, with the assistance of Mar Aprim Khamis, in the Cathedral Church of St. George, Chicago. The new Metropolitan was given the ecclesiastical name Mar Gewargis III. Episcopal career During Gewargis's metropolitanship he established the archdiocesan minor seminary in Baghdad, which produced numerous priests and deacons for Iraq. Some of the students were sent to Europe for doctoral studies in theology. In 1994, after the fall of the USSR, Metropolitan Gewargis began a mission to the Assyrians in the Russian Federation, establishing a number of mission parishes. In that year, a permanent priest was assigned for the newly established parish of St. Mary in Moscow. The newly built church, in honour of St. Mary, was then consecrated. The number of deacons and priests for the Assyrian Church of the East in Russia increased. In 1998 he travelled to China and made contact with the Christian communities there. He visited some of the ancient relics of the Assyrian Church of the East, which have been present in China since the establishment of missions to China in the early history of the Church of the East. Gewargis also made historical visits to the regions of Mardin and Hakk√¢ri, now in southern Turkey, where there are many relics of the Assyrian Church of the East dating back to the early history of the Church. Metropolitan Gewargis established a library within the Metropolitan's residence, which now houses hundreds of ancient manuscripts. While in Baghdad, he established the Metropolitan's Press, and had a number of liturgical books and other volumes of a catechetical nature printed for worldwide use. In 2009 he established the Urhai (Edessa) private elementary school in Baghdad. Gewargis has been active in ecumenical forums and fraternal exchange between the Assyrian Church of the East, and other eastern churches and ecclesiastical organisations, in particular with the Middle East Council of Churches (MECC) and the Council of the Heads of Churches in Baghdad. Election and consecration as Catholicos-Patriarch Between 16‚Äì18 September 2015, the Council of Prelates of the Assyrian Church of the East met in a Synod in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Baptist in Erbil, Iraq. On 18 September 2015, the Prelates elected Mar Gewargis Sliwa as the 121st Catholicos-Patriarch of the Holy See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. On 27 September 2015 he was consecrated and enthroned as Catholicos-Patriarch in the Church, with Mar Aprem Mooken, Metropolitan of Malabar and India, and Mar Meelis Zaia, Metropolitan of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon presiding. Mar Gewargis Sliwa formally assumed the ecclesiastical name Mar Gewargis III.

Ulna and radius of Stephanosaurus In 1902, Lawrence Lambe named a new set of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as Trachodon marginatus. Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids from the same rocks in the 1910s, in what is now known as the late Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Dinosaur Park Formation. Lambe assigned two new skulls to T. marginatus, and based on the new information, coined the genus Stephanosaurus for the species in 1914. Lambe retained the original species marginatus, so the type specimen of Stephanosaurus was the original, scrappy limb bones and crushed skull fragments, not the two new skulls. However, the limb bones and skull fragments could not be reliably said to come from the same animal as the complete skulls, or differentiated from other hadrosaurs. Because there was very little to associate the complete skulls with the scrappy earlier marginatus material, in 1923 William Parks proposed a new genus and species for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe: Lambeosaurus lambei (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869). Stephanosaurinae, a group which Lambe named in 1920, was also renamed Lambeosaurinae.

Little reliable information exists which can be used to reconstruct the background and career of the historical figure. Available materials include early Welsh poetry, genealogies and hagiography, which are often late and of uncertain value. Putative biography He is thought to have been a son of his predecessor Brochwel Ysgithrog and the father of Selyf Sarffgadau, who may have succeeded him. Later Welsh genealogies trace his lineage to Cadell Ddyrnllug. His epithet Garwyn, possibly Carwyn, has been explained as meaning either \\"of the White Thigh\\" or \\"of the White Chariot\\". Cynan may be the same person as Aurelius Caninus, one of the Welsh tyrants who are fiercely criticised by the mid-6th century cleric Gildas in his De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, but there is also a possibility that the latter refers to Cynin ap Millo, a relative of Cynan's. Cynan is the addressee of a poem ascribed to Taliesin, Trawsganu Kynan Garwyn Mab Brochfael, which, though first attested in the fourteenth- century Book of Taliesin, might actually date back to the sixth century.The Poems of Taliesin, ed. by Ifor Williams, trans. by J. E. Caerwyn Williams, Medieval and Modern Welsh Series, 3 (Dublin: The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1968), pp. xxviii-xxxv. Here he is presented as a warlord who led many successful campaigns throughout Wales: on the River Wye, against the men of Gwent, on Anglesey, and in Dyfed (where his opponent in Dyfed may have been Aergul Lawhir ap Tryffin), Brycheiniog and Cornwall. Unlike his son, he is never described as having faced the English in battle. The saints' lives highlight a more peaceful side to Cynan's reign, but as these works are late and were written to demonstrate the powers of the saints, rather little credence can be given to them. In Lifris' Life of St Cadog, abbot of Llancarfan (written c. 1100), Cynan Garwyn intends to undertake a raid against Glamorgan, whose king is so terrified that he asks the clergy of the saint's house to intercede for him. The clerics travel to Cynan and when they are halted at the River Neath, one of them climbs up a tree to approach the king from up high. The tree bends in such a way that it forms a bridge to the opposite bank of the river and having so witnessed the saint's miraculous powers, Cynan is dissuaded from his violent plans and proclaims peace on all the land.Life of St Cadog ¬ß 44, ed. an tr. A.W. Wade-Evans, Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1944. 24‚Äì141. Cynan is here described as a king of Rheinwg, which may be a territory in Dyfed or on the border between modern-day Herefordshire and Brecknockshire. In the Welsh life of St Beuno, Cynan is credited for granting land at Gwyddelwern (in Edeirnion) to the saint. Other sons beside Selyf Sarffgadau include Eiludd, who is sometimes mistaken for Selyf, and unreliable sources add Maredudd and Dinogad to the list. Some genealogies record that he married Gwenwynwyn 'of the Scots'. It is sometimes argued that he died with his son at the Battle of Chester in circa AD 613 but any precise description would be based more on the desire to create a myth of the foundation of a dynasty or legend of Powysian glory than on available evidence.

History WLDR studios WLDR-FM signed on in 1966 by Rod Maxson, a well-known businessman in Traverse City along with Robert L. Greaige who was the one with the knowledge of the radio business. Maxson was the owner of Grand Traverse Auto, the city's Ford dealership. With the exception of the nine years in which they played country, WLDR carried some sort of adult contemporary format for its first 38 years, and today. The station's call letters stood for \\"Long Distance Radio\\", suitable since they broadcast at 100 kW. In 1972, Maxson sold a majority of WLDR to one of his salesmen, Don Wiitala, who owned the station for more than 30 years. Wiitala was a beloved broadcaster known for giving the station a home-spun image. WLDR was a station that has many aspects of many full-service stations; the station, although licensed to broadcast 24 hours, signed on in the morning and signed off at night, aired local high school sporting events, had a \\"tradio\\" show - Wiitala even sold his old house on the show - and played music Wiitala found suitable for his audience. Maxson also sold a minority of WLDR to his son, Dave Maxson, who served as the station's news director until he decided to work for the Reynolds-Jonkhoff Funeral Home. He remains with WLDR to this day though he sold his stake in the station years ago. Rod died in 2005. Throughout the 1970s, WLDR was coined \\"Stereo 102\\". Some say that Wiitala was frugal in the way he ran WLDR; he would go to the local Giantway (a now-defunct grocery/retail outlet with a chain of stores in central and northern Michigan) in Traverse City (now Tom's Food Market and Dunham Sports Outfitters) and buy 45s cheap off the rack. The same tactics were employed in the purchase of LPs. Only obscure record labels would suffice along with artists from a bygone era. The syndicated John Doremus show aired four hours each day. Northern Michigan's first call-in talk show, \\"Listen to the Mrs.\\" aired weekday afternoons. In the 1980s, WLDR changed its name to \\"Sunny 102\\" to update the station's image. Throughout the 1990s, WLDR was part of a dying breed: one-station owners. Also, in the age of 24-hour formats, the station signed on at 5 a.m. and signed off at 1 a.m. Although the station promoted a 'family-friendly' image, the station would play a few alternative rock artists, such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and U2. However, the station was losing a lot of listeners to Trish MacDonald-Garber's WLXT/Lite 96. Starting in the late 1990s, Wiitala, who was in his sixties, was taking offers for WLDR. In 2000, he sold WLDR to Roy Henderson and his Fort Bend Broadcasting Group, who maintained WLDR's AC format, but changed the station's named from Sunny 102 to Sunny 101.9. Before he sold WLDR to Henderson, Wiitala allowed WLDR to remain on the air 24 hours, thanks to a new automated hard drive system. The station also started airing the syndicated Delilah show. When Henderson purchased WLDR, he also purchased several other stations, such as WOUF 92.1 (Beulah), which simulcasts WLDR-FM, WBNZ 99.3 (Frankfort) and WCUZ 100.1 (Bear Lake) with the intention to move the stations closer to Traverse City and boost their power. The move would also allow Henderson to develop new formats for northern Michigan radio, like he did in Texas with his popular \\"Texas Rebel Radio\\" format. Because of objections from other broadcasters, many of the moves never happened, although WOUF has moved to 92.3 and boosted power to 50 kW. Changes in 2000: Acquisition of WLDR-AM In 2000, Henderson also purchased what is now WLDR-AM 1210 in Kingsley. The station was part of a massive overhaul in the Michigan AM dial when Bell Broadcasting increased the power of its WCHB 1200 in Detroit. In order to do so, it purchased two AMs in the Saginaw area: WKNX 1210 Saginaw (signed on in 1947) and WXOX 1250 Bay City (which had been dark since 1993) and moved WKNX to 1250 (now WJMK) and moved 1210 AM to Kingsley in 1997. However, Bell moved the station's aging transmitter to a toxic waste dump near Kingsley, creating transmission troubles. Bell wanted to sell 1210, now with the call letters WJZZ, because it did not want to broadcast in a smaller market out of its footprint. WJZZ had a full-time automated jazz format, but when Bell sold to Radio One, it decided to keep WJZZ off the air as much as possible with a few short-lived stints as urban oldies. Radio One sold WJZZ to Henderson who renamed the station WLDR-AM for a mere $225,000, despite the fact that it now was the most-powerful AM station in the daytime at 50 kW. In 2001, Henderson gave 1210 a permanent format as talk from the Michigan Talk Radio Network. For a while, he changed the station's call letters to WWJR after a Sheboygan, Wisconsin station gave them up in December 2001 during a rebrand to WHBZ, which gave the station similar calls to Detroit's WWJ and WJR. The call sign was later changed back to WLDR-AM. In 2004, Henderson changed WLDR-AM from talk to satellite-fed \\"Country Classics\\" from Waitt Radio Networks, identifying as \\"Real Country 1210\\" (not to be confused with ABC Radio's satellite-delivered format also called \\"Real Country\\"). A year later, in 2005, he changed WLDR-FM to country. WOUF and WCUZ soon began to simulcast each other with an automated \\"traditional\\" country format called \\"The Wolf\\". It was similar to Texas Rebel Radio, playing everything from Waylon and Willie to some of the most popular alt-country artists of today. \\"The Wolf\\" has since disappeared. WOUF (now broadcasting with 50,000 watts at 92.3) and sister station WBNZ 99.3 FM in Frankfort swapped frequencies in July 2009, with WOUF retaining the \\"Wolf\\" name on 99.3 but shifting to a rock format while WBNZ's AC format moved to 92.3 as \\"EZ Rock 92.3.\\" At last report, WCUZ was simulcasting 99.3 WOUF. Henderson traded WLDR-AM to Stone Communications in exchange for WWKK-AM 750 in Petoskey, Michigan. AM 1210 is now WJNL and simulcasts with Stone Communications' 1110 WJML. WWKK took on the WLDR call letters and dropped its talk format to simulcast WLDR-FM. The station has since changed calls to WARD but continues simulcasting WLDR-FM. Much of WLDR-FM's programming was delivered via satellite using Waitt Radio Networks' \\"Country Today\\" format. Sunny Country was also the Traverse City area affiliate for University of Michigan sports and Traverse City Beach Bums baseball. On October 22, 2014, WLDR-FM, WARD and WBNZ changed to AC, as 101.9 The Bay. However, shortly after the station's re-launch, a frozen water pipe burst in the station's studios and offices, causing the stations to fall silent for two weeks.http://www.record-eagle.com/news/local_news/wldr-off-the-air-until-next- week/article_fabb42f6-2a62-5a8f-bb7e-cda08146e704.html Station management submitted an STA to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to state that WCUZ, WBNZ and WOUF were to remain silent until repairs were made.http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/138116/ownership-of-st- louis-area-fm-transferred LMA with Blarney Stone On October 1, 2018 Henderson entered a local marketing agreement with Grayling-based Blarney Stone Broadcasting.

It can be seen as part of the more general British colonization of the Americas. The Madoc legend A story popularized in the 16th century claimed that the first European to see America was the Welsh prince Madoc in 1170. A son of Owain Gwynedd, prince of Gwynedd, he had supposedly fled his country during a succession crisis with a troop of colonists and sailed west. He eventually landed near the Mississippi River and founded a colony, which later mingled with the Native Americans. In the late 16th century the legend was used by writers such as John Dee to support English claims to North America. The legend was revived in the 18th century with tales of Welsh-speaking Native Americans, but most modern scholars consider it to have no basis in fact. North America A bilingual poster advertising passage from Wales to New York or Philadelphia, 1841 There was extensive Welsh emigration to the United States and Canada, but only a few attempts to set up separate Welsh colonies. Sir William Vaughan sent Welsh colonists to Renews, Newfoundland in 1617 to establish a permanent colony, which eventually failed. Vaughan made further attempts to establish a colony at Trepassey which he called Cambriol and this eventually transformed into the Province of Avalon, under Lord Baltimore and dedicated \\"in imitation of Old Avalon in Somersetshire wherein Glassenbury stands, the first fruits of Christianity in Britain as the other was in that party of America.\\" =Pennsylvania= Coulsontown, Pennsylvania by quarrymen from Wales in the mid 19th century Many Quakers from Wales emigrated to Pennsylvania in the 17th century with a promise from William Penn that they would be allowed to set up a Welsh colony there. The Welsh Tract was to have been a separate county whose local government would use the Welsh language, since many of the settlers spoke no English. The promise however was not kept and by the 1690s the land had already been partitioned into different counties, and the Tract never gained self-government. In the late 18th century, a Welsh colony named Cambria was established by Morgan John Rhys in what is now Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Later, between 1856 and 1867, there was an attempt by Samuel Roberts to establish a Welsh colony at Brynffynnon, Tennessee. Meanwhile, Michael D. Jones developed plans to establish colonies in Wisconsin, Oregon, and in British Columbia, but these were not realized. =Idaho= Malad Valley was settled in the 1860s by Welsh pioneers who brought their Welsh traditions with them. One important tradition was an annual eisteddfod, patterned after the music and poetry contests held in Wales for over 900 years. Malad Valley's eisteddfod was an annual cultural arts event held in Malad and Samaria on alternating years. Judges came from Salt Lake City to choose the best vocal and instrumental numbers and recitations. The eisteddfod was an all-day event with people coming from all over Oneida County. The custom continued until 1916 and World War I. =Tennessee= Following the American Civil War, 104 Welsh immigrant families moved from Pennsylvania to East Tennessee. These Welsh families settled in an area now known as Mechanicsville, and part of the city of Knoxville. These families were recruited by the brothers Joseph and David Richards to work in a rolling mill then co-owned by John H. Jones. The Richards brothers co-founded the Knoxville Iron Works beside the L&N; Railroad, later to be used as the site for the World's Fair 1982. Of the original buildings of the Iron Works where Welsh immigrants worked at, only the structure housing the restaurant 'The Foundry' remains. In 1982 World's Fair the building was known as the Strohause. Having first met at donated space at the Second Presbyterian Church, the immigrant Welsh built their own Congregational Church with the Reverend Thomas Thomas serving as the first pastor in 1870. However, by 1899 the church property was sold. The Welsh immigrant families became successful and established other businesses in Knoxville, which included a company that built coal cars, several slate roofing companies, a marble company, and several furniture companies. By 1930 many Welsh dispersed into other sections of the city and neighboring counties such as Sevier County. Today, more than 250 families in greater Knoxville can trace their ancestry directly to these original immigrants. The Welsh tradition in Knoxville is remembered with Welsh descendants celebrating St. David's Day. =Ohio= Jackson and Gallia counties in Ohio were settled by Welsh immigrants in the 19th century, many from the Ceredigion area of West Wales. =New York= Numerous Welsh immigrants settled in the town of Freedom and surrounding townships in Cattaraugus County in southwestern New York during the 19th century. In 1795 Welsh immigrants settled in the village of Remsen, New York where their families flourished as dairy farmers. Numerous stone houses and barns in the region attest to the Welsh heritage. The Welsh language was still spoken in the area well into the 1970s. South America Old stone house from early Welsh settlement in Gaiman, Chubut, Argentina In 1852 Thomas Benbow Phillips of Tregaron established a settlement of about 100 Welsh people in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. Many of these colonists later moved to the more successful colony in Argentina as part of Y Wladfa (\\"The Colony\\"). The best known of the Welsh colonies, the colony in the Chubut Valley of Patagonia known as Y Wladfa Gymreig (\\"The Welsh Colony\\"), was established in 1865 when 153 settlers landed at what is now Puerto Madryn. Shortly before this, the colonists had reached an agreement with Argentina's minister of the interior, Guillermo Rawson, that the colony would be recognized as one of the states of Argentina when its population reached 20,000. However this pledge was not ratified by the Argentinian Congress, out of fear that the British government would use the presence of the settlers as an excuse to seize Patagonia.

She was also the great-granddaughter of the composer Franz Liszt. Born in Bayreuth, she was known by the nickname \\"Die Maus\\" or \\"Mausi\\". Along with other members of her family, from early in life Friedelind Wagner was involved with the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. In 1936, Friedelind Wagner began work as an assistant to Heinz Tietjen but her outspoken criticism of close family friend Adolf Hitler ‚Äî her mother, the English-born Winifred Williams, was a fanatical admirer of Hitler ‚Äî and the policies of the Third Reich led to her leaving Germany in 1939. She lived for a short time in Switzerland before emigrating first to England, where she had been interned on the Isle of Man from 27. May 1940 till 15. February 1941, later she began writing anti-Nazi columns for the Daily Sketch newspaper. With the help of Arturo Toscanini, in 1941 Friedelind Wagner moved to the United States where she became involved with radio broadcasts of anti-Nazi propaganda and became an American citizen. She also helped Professor Henry A. Murray, Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic plus psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer and other experts to create a 1943 report for the OSS designated as the Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler. With writer Page Cooper, in 1945 Friedelind Wagner wrote her memoirs \\"Heritage of Fire.\\" Published in English in New York City by Harper & brothers, it was released in London in 1948 as \\"The Royal Family of Bayreuth.\\" In 1953, Friedelind Wagner eventually returned to work at the Bayreuth Festival, occupying the top floor of the gardener‚Äôs cottage at Haus Wahnfried, the Wagner home, that became later a museum. At Bayreuth, she directed master classes for young singers, conductors and directors. In 1976, she was part of the team that made the documentary film \\"Wagner:The Making of the Ring\\" which was filmed during the creation of the Pierre Boulez/Patrice Ch√©reau Ring. The Times wrote: \\"This (Boulez/Ch√©reau) Ring is the most important single event in the democratization of opera and will put opera back at the center of all the arts, where it belongs.\\" As her student, American conductor Michael Tilson Thomas was a Musical Assistant and Assistant Conductor at the Bayreuth Festival.

It is a supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model that adds an additional singlet chiral superfield to the MSSM and can be used to dynamically generate the mu term, solving the mu-problem. Articles about the NMSSM are available for review. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model does not explain why the mu parameter in the superpotential term mu H_u H_d is at the electroweak scale. The idea behind the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is to promote the mu term to a gauge singlet, chiral superfield S. Note that the scalar superpartner of the singlino S is denoted by hat{S} and the spin-1/2 singlino superpartner by tilde{S} in the following. The superpotential for the NMSSM is given by :W_{text{NMSSM}}=W_{text{Yuk}}+lambda S H_u H_d + frac{kappa}{3} S^3 where W_{text{Yuk}} gives the Yukawa couplings for the Standard Model fermions. Since the superpotential has a mass dimension of 3, the couplings lambda and kappa are dimensionless; hence the mu-problem of the MSSM is solved in the NMSSM, the superpotential of the NMSSM being scale-invariant. The role of the lambda term is to generate an effective mu term. This is done with the scalar component of the singlet hat{S} getting a vacuum- expectation value of langle hat{S} rangle; that is, we have :mu_{text{eff}}= lambda langle hat{S} rangle Without the kappa term the superpotential would have a U(1)' symmetry, so-called Peccei‚ÄìQuinn symmetry; see Peccei‚ÄìQuinn theory. This additional symmetry would alter the phenomenology completely. The role of the kappa term is to break this U(1)' symmetry. The kappa term is introduced trilinearly such that kappa is dimensionless. However, there remains a discrete mathbb{Z}_3 symmetry, which is moreover broken spontaneously. Translated in In principle this leads to the domain wall problem. Introducing additional but suppressed terms, the mathbb{Z}_3 symmetry can be broken without changing phenomenology at the electroweak scale. It is assumed that the domain wall problem is circumvented in this way without any modifications except far beyond the electroweak scale. Other models have been proposed which solve the mu-problem of the MSSM. One idea is to keep the kappa term in the superpotential and take the U(1)' symmetry into account. Assuming this symmetry to be local, an additional, Z' gauge boson is predicted in this model, called the UMSSM.  Phenomenology  Due to the additional singlet S, the NMSSM alters in general the phenomenology of both the Higgs sector and the neutralino sector compared with the MSSM. = Higgs phenomenology = In the Standard Model we have one physical Higgs boson. In the MSSM we encounter five physical Higgs bosons. Due to the additional singlet hat{S} in the NMSSM we have two more Higgs bosons; that is, in total seven physical Higgs bosons. Its Higgs sector is therefore much richer than that of the MSSM. In particular, the Higgs potential is in general no longer invariant under CP transformations; see CP violation. Typically, the Higgs bosons in the NMSSM are denoted in an order with increasing masses; that is, by H_1, H_2, ..., H_7, with H_1 the lightest Higgs boson. In the special case of a CP-conserving Higgs potential we have three CP even Higgs bosons, H_1, H_2, H_3, two CP odd ones, A_1, A_2, and a pair of charged Higgs bosons, H^+, H^-. In the MSSM, the lightest Higgs boson is always Standard Model-like, and therefore its production and decays are roughly known. In the NMSSM, the lightest Higgs can be very light (even of the order of 1 GeV), and thus may have escaped detection so far. In addition, in the CP-conserving case, the lightest CP even Higgs boson turns out to have an enhanced lower bound compared with the MSSM. This is one of the reasons why the NMSSM has been the focus of much attention in recent years. = Neutralino phenomenology = The spin-1/2 singlino tilde{S} gives a fifth neutralino, compared with the four neutralinos of the MSSM. The singlino does not couple with any gauge bosons, gauginos (the superpartners of the gauge bosons), leptons, sleptons (the superpartners of the leptons), quarks or squarks (the superpartners of the quarks). Suppose that a supersymmetric partner particle is produced at a collider, for instance at the LHC, the singlino is omitted in cascade decays and therefore escapes detection. However, if the singlino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), all supersymmetric partner particles eventually decay into the singlino. Due to R parity conservation this LSP is stable. In this way the singlino could be detected via missing transverse energy in a detector.

The prisoners of the old Kilby Prison were moved to Holman Prison. It was named in honor of a former warden, William C. Holman. Due in part to legislative rules creating long-term penalties for drug crimes, the prison population at Holman and other facilities began to climb in the 1970s. On Friday August 29, 1975, two U.S. federal district court judges, William Brevard Hand and Frank M.

Most inmates were moved from Holman to other facilities. However, death row and the execution chamber were to remain at Holman. In July, 2020, Department of Corrections Commissioner Jefferson Dunn provided an update to state legislators on the status of the state prison system.

The prison administration has not installed air conditioning, so the prison has hundreds of industrial fans used for moving the air in an attempt to provide cooling. The hottest areas in the prison are the kitchen facilities. Staff shortages are made worse by absenteeism. On some days, as few as nine guards are on duty. Only two of the six towers on the perimeter are manned. Annual staff turnover is reported to be 60 percent. As a result of a hiring freeze in 2014, mandatory overtime was commonly required for the guards.

He came from a prominent Russian artistic family of French origin.Chilvers, Ian. \\"A Dictionary of Twentieth- Century Art\\", p. 560. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999. His father, Eugeny Alexandrovich Lanceray, was a sculptor. His grandfather Nicholas Benois, and his uncle Leon Benois, were celebrated architects. Another uncle, Alexandre Benois, was a respected artist, art critic, historian and preservationist. His great-grandfather was Venetian-born Russian composer Catterino Cavos. Lanceray's siblings were also heirs to this artistic tradition. His sister, Zinaida Serebriakova, was a painter, while his brother Nikolay was an architect. His cousin, Nadia Benois, was mother of Peter Ustinov. His father Eugene Lanceray, who was also an artist, died early, aged forty; when the boy was eleven years old. However, his father's example, memories of everything that was connected with his life and work affected the formation of the personality of the future artist. Already a mature and experienced master, Eugene Lanceray noted that ‚Äúhis search for the right everyday gesture, interest in the ethnographic characterization of characters‚Äù, and, finally, ‚Äúattraction to the Caucasus‚Äù were received from his father ‚Äúas a heredity‚Äù characteristic of his work.Evgenij Evgenevich Lansere.

Lanceray took his first lessons at the Drawing School of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in St. Petersburg from 1892 to 1896.Bown, Matthew Cullerne. \\"Art Under Stalin\\", p. 243. New York: Holmes & Meier, 1991. under Jan CiƒÖgli≈Ñski and Ernst Friedrich von Liphart. He then traveled to Paris, where he continued his studies at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and Acad√©mie Julian between 1896 and 1899.  Career before the revolution  After returning from France to Russia, Lanceray joined Mir iskusstva, an influential Russian art movement inspired by an artistic journal of the same name, founded in 1899, in Saint Petersburg.Scholl, Tim. \\"From Petipa to Balanchine: Classical Revival and the Modernization of Ballet\\", page 43 & 144. London: Routledge, 1994. Other prominent members of Mir iskusstva' included Lanceray's uncle Alexandre Benois, Konstantin Somov, Walter Nouvel, L√©on Bakst, and Dmitry Filosofov. Like other members of Mir iskusstva, he was fascinated with the \\"sparkling dust\\" of Rococo art, and often turned to the 18th-century Russian history and art for inspiration.Catriona Kelly, David Shepherd. \\"Constructing Russian Culture in the Age of Revolution, 1881-1940\\", page 182. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.Pushkarev, Sergei. \\"The Emergence of Modern Russia, 1801-1917\\", p. 327. New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston, 1963. Eugene Lanceray was younger than the masters of Mir iskusstva and initially acted as their student. His creative method and aesthetic views evolved under the influence and guidance of Benois, although, by some aspects of his talent, Lanceray may have exceeded his teacher. His first significant works in the field of easel painting and graphics were created in the late 1890 - early 1900s. The main creative interests of the artist were turned at that time to the \\"historical\\", mainly architectural landscape.http://www.smr.ru/centre/win/artists/lansere/biogr_lansere.htm Lanceray's most celebrated mural painting is located at the ceiling of Moscow Kazansky railway station (1933-1934). Besides its place and its scale, the distinctive feature of this work is that it was made using tempera paint, so beloved by the artist. But he worked with various media, and the area of his activity included not only mural art but also fine art, graphics, illustration and theatrical scenery. For the first time, Lanceray took to the work in the theater in early 1900s, paying tribute to the passion for theater painting, which was characteristic of almost all the representatives of the older generation of the Mir iskusstva group.  Life after the revolution  The Nikolsky Market in St. Petersburg Lanceray was the only prominent member of Mir iskusstva to remain in Russia after the Revolution of 1917. Being a representative of traditional painting (not avant-garde movement) and the bourgeoisie, he was not in great demand with the new Soviet government for a long time. Even his sister found the revolutionary milieu alien to her art and, in 1924, she fled to Paris. Lanceray himself hated the new Soviet regime that he had to exist in after 1917. It referred to his own understanding of the historical way of Russia and the massive oppressions towards his relatives and close friends (some of them immigrated and some of them were killed). In February 1932 he left a note in his diaries: ‚ÄòThere is incredible impoverishment. Of course, this is the government‚Äôs goal to bring everyone and everything to poverty, since it is easier to manage the poor and the hungry‚Äô.Khmelnitskiy D. ¬´Pogano rabotat na etikh lyudei...¬ª O dnevnikakh Evgeniya Lanceray. [¬´It's nasty to work for these people ...¬ª About the diaries of Eugene Lanceray. URL: http://gefter.ru/archive/15714 (accessed: 25.02.2020) (in Russ.).] Lanceray left Saint Petersburg in 1917, and spent three years living in Dagestan, where he became infatuated with Oriental themes. His interest increased during journeys made in the early 1920s to Japan and Ankara, Turkey. In 1920, he moved to Tiflis, Georgia. During his stay in Georgia, he lectured at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts (1922‚Äì1934) and illustrated the Caucasian novellas of Leo Tolstoy. Amongst his students was Apollon Kutateladze. Lanceray left Georgia in 1934, settling in Moscow, where he became engaged in the decoration of the Moscow Kazansky railway station and the Hotel Moskva.Bown, Matthew Cullerne. \\"Art Under Stalin\\", pages 81 & 243. New York: Holmes & Meier, 1991. During the same period, Lanceray also worked as a theatrical designer.Atkinson, W. Patrick. \\"Theatrical Design in the Twentieth Century: An Index to Photographic Reproductions of Scenic Designs\\", page 312. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1996. Three years before his death, he was honored with the Stalin Prize, and in 1945 he was awarded the title of the People's Artist of the RSFSR. He died in Moscow at the age of 71.  Moscow Kazansky Railway Station  One of the most well-known works of Lanceray is the mural of Kazanskiy Railway Station (1932-1934 and 1944-1946). Schusev, the famous Russian architect and a frequent character of Lanceray's diaries, was responsible for the whole process from the very beginning.[Kazanskij vokzal v preddverii revolyucii. 1916-1917 gody. URL: https://www.tg-m.ru/articles/prilozhenie-k-2-2017-55/kazanskiy-vokzal-v- predverii-revolutsii] (accessed: 28.02.2020) (in Russ.). In 1916, Schusev, Benois, Serebryakova, Lanceray were hired to plan the decorations and paintings for the Kazanskiy railway station, but the revolution broke off the plans. Lanceray at work on a panel for the Kazanskiy Railway station 1932 was the year when the state reform of architecture was carried out in the USSR, and ‚ÄòStalinist‚Äô architecture with its monumental style became canonical. Lanceray, an experienced monumental painter with conservative views, was invited from Tbilisi to Moscow to continue working at The Central Railway Station decorations. He was in charge of the restaurant located inside. In the 1932-1934 paintings, Lanceray tried to show specific features of every painted region. For instance, Murmansk displays a busy crew ship, while Crimea is depicted by a smiling Tatar woman against the background of a clear sky, exotic trees and a working carpenter. In the thirties, he managed to complete such murals as Moscow Construction, Murmansk, Crimea, and others. In January 1934, after gluing the first canvas to the plafond Lanceray writes: ‚Ä≥A turning, formidable day: today they glued the first picture, Crimea. Of course, I am shocked by the effect. It is small, puny, completely not picturesque, completely not monumental. <..> At this distance, there is no other volumetric effect <..> That's when you learn the experience and mastery of Byzantium!‚Ä≥Boris (byk).

Because of the irregular construction of the building, high ceilings and unpredictable light, the artist faced difficulties to make the painting bright and noticeable. Besides its place and its scale, a distinctive feature of this work is that it was made using tempera paint. The artist also preferred to paint on a canvas that would then be attached to the ceiling. But, while Lanceray was disappointed with his inappropriate use of technique, the Committee members were not really satisfied with the subject of Lanceray's paintings.Khmelnitskiy D. ¬´Pogano rabotat na etikh lyudei...¬ª O dnevnikakh Evgeniya Lanceray.

Lanceray kept working on these monumental paintings after the war finished. After his death, other artists had to finish the work according to the sketches he left.ZHivopisnye panno E.E. Lansere ¬´Pobeda¬ª i ¬´Mir¬ª vestibyulya Kazanskogo vokzala. URL: https://www.mskagency.ru/materials/2201332 (accessed: 28.02.2020) (in Russ.). Nowadays the decorated plafond of Kazanskiy railway station looks very contrast. Heavy soviet paintings of predominantly brown shades seem lost among pompous gilded stucco molding. Today this part of the building is used as a superior lounge, where people who buy business class tickets can wait for their departure. On every New Year's Eve, there is a constructed stage where children's performances are shown and music concerts are played.  Mural artworks in Kharkiv  In 1932, Lanceray completed two of his monumental works at the Zheleznodorozhnik Palace of Culture (now \\"the Central House of Culture and Technology of the South Railway\\") in Kharkiv. One of them is called Partisans of the Caucasus salute the Red Army and the other one Meeting of Komsomol members with the peasants of Crimea. Over time, the paintings deteriorated and were often hidden behind a cloth. In connection with the Euro-2012, they were restored. These two murals are the only monumental works of Eugene Lanceray preserved in Ukraine and the only examples of murals of the 1930s that exist in Kharkiv. Although there were a lot of wall paintings in Kharkiv in the pre-war period, almost all of them either died during the war or disappeared during repairs, or were deliberately destroyed. After the adoption of the Law of Decommunization in Ukraine in 2015, these murals painted by Lanceray in Kharkiv were at risk of destruction. A public discussion was held on the conservation of them. Since the work could not be visually construed as direct communist propaganda, officials asked the state to give it the status of cultural heritage.Poslednie iz tridcatyh...

It stars Robert Clarke and Margaret Field. The film has a running time of 64 minutes. It deals with the effects of a nuclear war and how life would be afterwards. In the United Kingdom the movie is known as 3000 A.D., the film's original title. 3000 A.D. Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 20, Iss. 228, (Jan 1, 1953): 76. Plot The movie opens with war footage from a World War Three ending with a nuclear attack Long after the nuclear war, the last human survivors are divided into three tribes. Robert (Clarke) and Ruth (Field) are about to be married in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic New York City during a brief interlude in ongoing hostilities between their tribe, the Norms, and the rival tribe the Mutates. The Mutes try to adhere to the tenants of the Christian Bible, while norms reject this. But raiders from a third tribe, the Upriver People, attack through the Hudson Tunnel, capturing Ruth and with several other women. The warring tribes must put aside their differences to rescue the women, a joint effort which takes up rather little time in this short film. The Upriver people need fertile women. Ultimately the Upriver tribe is defeated and they are trapped in the Hudson River Tunnel as it is flooded. With the women recovered, there are improved prospects for a more peaceful tribal coexistence as the film concludes. Cast * Robert Clarke as Robert * Margaret Field as Ruth * Gloria Saunders as Catherine * Ron Randell as Riddon * William Schallert as Carver Production Jack Pollexfen and Aubrey Wisberg had a deal to make three films at RKO: Captive Women, Sword of Venus and Port Sinister. Albert Zugsmith became involved as an associate producer, taking 25% against Pollexfen and Wisberg's 75%. Pollexfen later said \\"our main problem in Captive Women was that we were battling Zugsmith too much to pay attention to the production\\". He says also that Howard Hughes, who then owned RKO, insisted the film be directed by Stewart Gilmore, who had been one of Hughes' leading editors, including on The Outlaw. Filming started 9 July 1951.FILMLAND BRIEFS Los Angeles Times 9 July 1951: B7. Robert Clarke recalled that Gilmore: > He was lost. Completely. The poor man had tremendous problems; there were > too many people in the cast, too many actors with no dialogue in the scenes > , and the fact that they had over-extended themselves for special > effects...The whole film was ineffectual. Pollexfen and Wisberg were trying > to make a better picture‚Äî sometimes, Hollywood thinks that if you spend more > money, you make a better picture. Well, this is one instance where that > didn‚Äôt happen. Gilmore was in over his head ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt know directing, and > l don‚Äôt think he ever did another picture because he got a bad taste in his > mouth from this one. William Schallert recalls that the film was rewritten during the shoot and actors had to constantly learn new parts. Pollexfen says the budget was around $85,000 of which he and his partner received a fee of $15,000 and Zugsmith was paid $2,500. At one stage the film was known as 3000 AD. Another original title was found 1,000 Years from Now, but RKO wanted a more sensational title.https://archive.org/details/variety188-1952-10/page/n21/mode/2up The ruins of New York are briefly shown in matte paintings by Block.http://www.sf- encyclopedia.com/entry/captive_women In 1956, it was re-released by the name 1000 Years from Now. It was one of three films Albert Zugsmith made for RKO. It was Ron Randell's first science fiction film. Reception Variety found the movie's plot to be plodding and most of the good ideas left off screen, although the camera work was good as was Ron Randall's acting.Review of film at Variety The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction found the movie of some importance as one of if not the first science fiction film to consider what the world might become some time after a nuclear war.

Stanley and three others resigned from the cabinet of Lord Grey on this particular issue but other factors included their fear that the Whigs were appeasing their radical and Irish allies with further reforms. The group's name 'Derby Dilly' is a reference to Stanley being the heir of the Earl of Derby. Formation In 1830 Lord Grey had formed a government that had achieved political success by passing the Reform Act 1832 and abolishing slavery in the British Empire. However, it was an unstable coalition composed of Whigs, Canningites, Radicals, Irish Repealers and Tory mavericks. It had achieved a crushing electoral victory in 1832 against a demoralised Tory party but then quickly fell factional fighting. Lord John Russell wanted to extend the cause of reform to other areas of governance but others like Lord Stanley feared the growth of radicalism and in particular the influence of the Irish Repealers led by Daniel O'Donnell. In May 1834, the pressure became too great and Stanley, with Earl of Ripon, Sir James Graham and The Duke of Richmond resigned from the cabinet on the issue of proposed changes to the structure and finances of the Church of Ireland. Preferring to call themselves 'Moderate Whigs' or just 'Moderates', Stanley and his immediate cohorts including Graham and Francis Burdett, at first, remained on the government benches in the House of Commons. They were at first known unofficially as the 'Stanleyites', as they seemed more of an old-style parliamentary faction that was familiar in British politics from the 18th and early 19th centuries. However, the group soon received a new name from its political opponents to which they are now best remembered: 'The Derby Dilly'. It was an allusion to a type of stagecoach called the 'Derby Dilly' (short for 'Diligence') and referred to Stanley's hereditary family title 'Earl of Derby'. Remembering Stanley's remark that when he had left the cabinet that it had led to an 'upsetting of the ministerial coach', the Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell labelled the group the 'Derby Dilly', with a clever reference to the lines of a poem by George Canning and others, 'The Loves of the Triangles'. It had been a work of parody, actually attacking the works of Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles Darwin) and had the lines 'Still down thy steep, romantic Ashbourne, glides The Derby dilly carrying six insides'.  Failure to create a centre grouping  The idea of an erratic coach, with Stanley driving the horses, was quickly picked up by others, and the name stuck to the group. He already had a reputation as the 'Prince Rupert of Debate', a man who could lead his followers into an attack but was unable to rally them afterward. As a result, it was difficult to estimate the number of MPs who were actually part of the 'Dilly'. It is possible that they then numbered up to 70, but they lacked a core set of political beliefs or attitudes. Many of them still remained uncertain whether to go back to the Whigs, join the Tories or attempt to create a third political force. Some political observers wondered if the 'Dilly' (or at least those identified solidly with Stanley) really numbered only half a dozen MPs at most. Despite his growing estrangement from the Whigs, Stanley remained on good terms with his former party leader, Earl Grey. In November 1834, following the resignation of The Viscount Melbourne, Sir Robert Peel invited Stanley (now Lord Stanley) and others in the 'Dilly' to join his minority Tory government. Stanley declined but made it obvious that he was finding himself in general agreement with Peel's attempt to form an administration. In December 1834, Stanley decided that he needed to at least define a set of ideas to distinguish his group from the other parties and factions in the House of Commons. In a speech at Glasgow University that was subsequently dubbed 'The Knowsley Creed', after the Stanley family's ancestral home Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool, Stanley gave the student audience an outline of his political beliefs. Besides affirming his staunch support of the established church and opposition to 'destructive reform', Stanley still signalled his political belief that it was not possible to reverse reform or undertake a reactionary domestic agenda. 'The machine must move forward for good or evil ‚Äì for it cannot be stopped; like the fire it may purify, if properly kindled by a skilful hand, but if it should be impetuously and recklessly accelerated, destruction and overwhelming wreck must be the inevitable consequences'. However, Stanley had been pre-empted by Peel three days earlier, on 8 December 1834. Peel had then issued an election address to his constituent, later dubbed the Tamworth Manifesto, which covered much of the same political and religious ground as Stanley's speech. Now usually known as a founding political ideology for what was to become the Conservative Party, it too said that Peel's party would support reform to correct 'abuses' if necessary and marked a contrast to the earlier old Toryism that had appeared to be opposed to all change. It also meant that in practice, the 'Derby Dilly' with its 'Knowsley Creed' and the Conservatives' 'Tamworth Manifesto' were two sides of the same coin.  Merger with Conservative Party  Though they made electoral gains in the 1835 General Election, Peel's government remained a minority in the House of Commons. For the Derby Dilly, the election saw its members briefly attempt to forward their own candidates for election but apparently, there were no recruits to their diminishing band. However, surprisingly, Stanley thought he still had at least 86 supporters in January 1835 and described his band to a supporter as a 'corps de reserve', which King William IV could call upon 'in case of accidents' (to form a government if the monarch had enough of the Tory-Conservatives and Whig- Radical blocs). Though Stanley may have had in mind King George III's example of appointing William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister in 1783, in the end, it was his 'reserve' that crumbled away, and those who were left by March 1835 (between 30-40) were still unable to agree even to vote the same way on a given debate. By now, Lord Stanley was clearly leaning towards the Conservative Party. Any remote possibility of returning to the Whigs was scuttled by the Lichfield House Compact by which the Irish Repealers, Whigs and Radicals agreed to vote out Peel's government. That soon happened and left the 'Derby Dilly' nowhere else to go but to support Peel. When Peel resigned as Prime Minister in April 1835, the King invited not Stanley but Melbourne and the Whigs to form a new government, and Stanley received no invitation to rejoin the Whig fold. For a brief period, as a measure of the looseness of political labels at the time, there was talk of a 'Liberal and Conservative Party' combining Stanley, Graham, Peel and even Lord Grey, but it came to nothing. Instead, there was a steady drift of MPs from the old pro-reform coalition to the Conservatives: some who had originally joined Stanley's group and others who went over independently. One estimate puts that number at least 50 MPs switching political allegiance between 1835 and 1841. For Stanley (now Lord Stanley) and the remaining 'Derby Dilly' supporters (about 20 MPs in by 1837), there was now a staged progression across to the Conservatives. That is best illustrated by Stanley's own movement across the political spectrum. In 1836, he resigned from the Whig-supporting 'Brooks's Club', officially because his old political enemy Daniel O'Connell had become a member, and by the next elections, in 1837, the remaining Stanleyites were reliant on Conservative support to get back to parliament. In November 1837 Stanley and Graham joined other Conservative MPs at a meeting prior to the opening of the new Parliament and in December, they had officially joined them and sat with Peel on the Opposition Front Bench. Lord Stanley finally sealed his new Conservative identity by becoming a member of the Tory 'Holy of Holies', the Conservative supporting Carlton Club. The remaining 'Derby Dilly' MPs were soon absorbed into the main Conservative Party. They included Lord George Bentinck, who was later better known for his alliance with Benjamin Disraeli in the 1840s against Peel on the issue of repealing the Corn Laws. Despite their Whig origins, Stanley, Bentinck and the former Radical Disraeli would ironically go on to break with Peel and take two thirds of his former party with them to recreate a new Conservative Party.

Early life and career Sultan was born into a large traditional Alawite Muslim family in Baniyas, Syria. Although Sultan wanted to be a writer, and would have preferred to study Arabic literature, she studied at the medical faculty at the University of Aleppo due to pressure from her family.Wendt, Jana, A Matter of Principle: New Meetings with the Good, the Great and the Formidable, Melbourne University Publishing, 2008, p.46 She says that she was shocked into secularism by the 1979 atrocities committed by Islamic extremists of the Muslim Brotherhood against innocent Syrians. She states that while she was a medical student, she witnessed the machine-gun assassination of her professor, Yusef al Yusef, an ophthalmologist from the university who was renowned outside Syria. \\"They shot hundreds of bullets into him, shouting, 'Allahu Akbar!' \\" she said. \\"At that point, I lost my trust in their god and began to question all our teachings. It was the turning point of my life, and it has led me to this present point. I had to leave. I had to look for another god.\\" She worked for four years as a psychiatrist in a hospital. She, her teacher husband, and children emigrated to the United States in 1989, where she moved to Los Angeles, California, and became a naturalized citizen. Initially she had to work as a cashier in a gas station and behind the counter in a pizza parlor, but she found her treatment in these jobs better than as a medical professional in Syria. From the time of her arrival she began to contribute articles to Arabic publications in the United States and published three books in Arabic. Sultan became notable after the September 11, 2001 attacks for her participation in Middle East political debates, with the publication of Arabic essays that were circulated widely and for television appearances on Al Jazeera and CNN in 2005. On February 21, 2006, she took part in Al Jazeera's weekly forty-five-minute discussion program The Opposite Direction. She spoke from Los Angeles, arguing with host Faisal al-Qassem and with Ibrahim Al-Khouli, a professor at Al-Azhar University in Cairo (Egypt), about Samuel P. Huntington's Clash of Civilizations theory. A six-minute composite video of her remarks was subtitled and widely circulated by MEMRI on blogs and through e-mail; The New York Times estimated that it has been seen at least one million times. In this video she criticised women's situation in Muslim countries, Muslims for treating non-Muslims differently and for not recognizing the accomplishments of Jews and other members of non-Muslim society while still benefiting from using their wealth and technology. The video became YouTube's most discussed video. The full transcript of the debate, which was made public later, also raised many online discussions. Following her participation in founding of the Former Muslims United on October 13, 2009, Sultan released her first book in English, A God Who Hates: The Courageous Woman Who Inflamed the Muslim World Speaks Out Against the Evils of Islam. In her book Sultan relates her life story and personal relationship with Islam. She attempts to address the history of Islam from a psychological perspective, and examine the political ideology of the religion's modern form. In October 2010 Sultan was called as an expert witness to give testimony at the Geert Wilders trial. Wilders is a Dutch politician who was charged with hate speech for his anti-Islamic statements and subsequently acquitted. At the trial Sultan confirmed that she had met Wilders several times in 2009, had seen his film Fitna, and in general agreed with his views about Islam. On January 10, 2011, Sultan, opposing Ibrahim Ramey, appeared on the Russian television news show CrossTalk with host Peter Lavelle, where she stated: \\"I'm not against Muslims, I'm against Islam.\\"RT news: CrossTalk: host Peter Lavelle, at marker number 17.10 RT news: CrossTalk: host Peter Lavelle, at marker number 17.10 Political views Sultan describes her thesis as witnessing \\"a battle between modernity and barbarism which Islam will lose\\". It has brought her telephone threats, but also praise from reformers. Her comments, especially a pointed criticism that \\"no Jew has blown himself up in a German restaurant\\", brought her an invitation to Jerusalem by the American Jewish Congress. Sultan believes that \\"The trouble with Islam is deeply rooted in its teachings. Islam is not only a religion. Islam [is] also a political ideology that preaches violence and applies its agenda by force.\\" In a discussion with Ahmad bin Muhammad, she said: \\"It was these teachings that distorted this terrorist and killed his humanity\\".

It was an iguanodontian discovered in England and was first described in 1879. The type species, S. macrocercus, was described by British paleontologist Harry Seeley in 1879 and it was later synonymised with Acanthopholis, but the genus was reinstated in a 2020 study, when Syngonosaurus and Eucercosaurus were reinterpreted as basal iguanodontians. History Sacral vertebra seen from two different angles; drawn in 1879 by Seeley himself Around 1865 commercial fossil collector John Griffiths found some dinosaurian remains, including osteoderms, at the shoreline near Folkestone in Kent, which he sold to the metallurgist Dr. John Percy. Percy brought them to the attention of Thomas Henry Huxley, who paid Griffiths to dig up all fossils he could find at the site. Despite being hampered by the fact that it was located between the tidemarks, he managed to uncover several additional bones and parts of the body armour. The type specimen, which consists of several vertebrae and a single osteoderm (?), was found in the Chalk Group, a formation itself dating to the Albian to Cenomanian stages around 105-100 million years ago (although the Chalk Group continued to be deposited until the Maastrichtian, around 66 million years ago). In 1869 Harry Govier Seeley named several new species of Acanthopholis based on remains from the Cambridge Greensand: Acanthopholis macrocercus, based on specimens CAMSM B55570-55609; Acanthopholis platypus (CAMSM B55454-55461); and Acanthopholis stereocercus (CAMSM B55558 55569). Later, Seeley split the material of Acanthopholis stereocercus and based a new species of Anoplosaurus on part of it: Anoplosaurus major. He also described a new species, Acanthopholis eucercus, on the basis of six caudal vertebrae (CAMSM 55552-55557). In 1902 however Franz Nopcsa changed it into another species of Acanthopholis: Acanthopholis major. Nopcsa at the same time renamed Anoplosaurus curtonotus into Acanthopholis curtonotus. In 1879 Seeley named the genus Syngonosaurus based on part of the type material of A. macrocercus. In 1956 Friedrich von Huene renamed A. platypus into Macrurosaurus platypus.von Huene, F. (1956) \\"Palaeontologie und Phylogenie der niederen Tetrapoden\\" In 1999 Xabier Pereda- Superbiola and Paul M. Barrett reviewed all Acanthopholis material. They concluded that all species were nomina dubia whose syntype specimens were composites of non-diagnostic ankylosaur and ornithopod remains; including Syngonosaurus. Syngonosaurus was seen as an ankylosaur in both a 2001 publication and a 2004 publication.M. K. Vickaryous, T. Maryanska, and D. B. Weishampel. 2004. Ankylosauria. In D. B. Weishampel, P.

First opened in 1938, the prison has housed some of the most dangerous inmates in the state's history, and it was the site of Georgia's death row until 1980. The facility houses 1550 inmates, with a wide range of security levels from Minimum to Close. The current warden is Trevonza Bobbitt. The prison stands at 300 1st Avenue South near Reidsville, Georgia. The state's extensive farm operation, Rogers State Prison, is also nearby - about a mile away.  History  The facility was designed by Atlanta architects Tucker & Howell. The modern classic architecture included a central tower and courtyard, and frieze by Julian Harris titled Rehabilitation depicting trades and occupations.Tucker and Howell Georgia Encyclopedia It opened in 1937. The building has been extensively renovated and expanded since. On January 1, 1938, Georgia's death row and execution chamber relocated from the old state prison at Milledgeville, where it had been since the September 13, 1924 execution of 22-year-old Howard Hinton, to GSP. One of the prisoners executed here was Lena Baker, an African American maid from Cuthbert, Georgia, who had been wrongfully convicted of murdering her employer. Killed in March 1945, she remains the only woman electrocuted by the state. From 1964 until 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court suspended executions. Then in June 1980 Georgia's site of execution was moved to the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison (GD&CP;) near Jackson, Georgia in Butts County. A new electric chair was installed in place of the previous one, which was put on display\\"A History of the Death Penalty in Georgia.\\" (Archive) Georgia Department of Corrections. Retrieved on November 18, 2012. on the upper floors of the main building. Also on display are prison documents containing names, authorizations, and last statements of the prisoners. In the 1940s and 1950s, volunteers were offered $25 to flip the switches which would start the flow of electricity and eventually lead to the death of the prisoner. Inmates would often be doused with saltwater to speed up their deaths, which often took minutes. Georgia State Prison was the first US prison to be accredited by the American Medical Association and the American Correctional Association.New Warden Appointed to Historic Georgia State Prison The facility was the filming location of the film, The Longest Yard, which starred Burt Reynolds, Eddie Albert, and James Hampton. Notable prisoners Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was transferred from the Dekalb County Jail in Decatur, Georgia, to the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Georgia and was released on October 27, 1960, on a $2,000 bond, after pressure from the Kennedy family. Until recently, GSP housed radical activist H. Rap Brown, now known as Jamil Al-Amin. Al-Amin was the chairman of SNCC in the late 1960s. In 2007, he was transferred to a federal facility where he now resides. References Further reading Interview with E. B.

The mashups are parody trailers that derive humor from misrepresenting original films: for instance, a film with a murderous plot is made to look like a comedy, or vice versa. They became popular on the Internet in 2005. Creation The making of retrailers became possible with the availability of consumer-level digital video editing suites. The more sophisticated of these allow the editor to separate the audio and video tracks of a clip, allowing the original score or soundtrack to be removed ‚Äî these contribute most to a scene's tone‚Äîand replaced with another. By placing clips of different characters (typically closeups) together in sequence, a relation between them may be implied, regardless of where each character is actually situated within their respective movie. All that remains is to include certain conventions such as voice-over narration, titles and credits, and the familiar MPAA rating system copy (the white-on-green introductory screen). History The earliest identified re-cut trailer debuted in December 2003, named Kill Christ, created by an NYU film student. It mocks the films Kill Bill: Volume 1 and The Passion of the Christ. In 2005, the format started to gain popularity with Robert Ryang's re-cut of The Shining, which made the horror film appear to be a light-hearted family comedy drama about father and son bonding, adding voice-over narration and Peter Gabriel's song \\"Solsbury Hill\\" to augment the re-edited footage. Ryang had made the re-cut trailer as part of a content for the Association of Independent Creative Editors from post-production house P.S. 260 in New York City, with his entry winning. After it was published to the Internet, it jump- started the popularity of re-cut trailers for the internet community. Soon after the Shining retrailer took the Internet by storm, Emerson College comedy troupe Chocolate Cake City created a re-cut trailer for the Back to the Future films, portraying the films' characters in a romantic homosexual relationship akin to the one by the main characters in the film Brokeback Mountain. The retrailer primarily used clips from Back to the Future Part III, which was set in the Wild West of the 19th century. Brokeback to the Future was one of several re-cuts that emerged in late 2005 in which a homosexual relationship was suggested between two male leads. As Brokeback to the Future gained popularity in early 2006, other re-cuts were created that specifically parodied Brokeback Mountain. In 2006, comedy troupe The Lonely Island made a Saturday Night Live Digital Short in which a trailer of Mel Gibson's upcoming film Apocalypto, a film entirely in the Yucatec Maya language, was recut and had English-language subtitles added to it based on statements made by Gibson during a well-publicized drunk driving incident of several months prior, to make it appear that the characters were saying anti-Semitic things. With continued growth of the Internet, including the ease of mixing videos and publishing to sites like YouTube, re-mix trailers continued to gain popularity. While most were made with the intent of present a film in a different genre than intended, other trailers were made to rectify what some might see as bad marketing or approaches to movie promotion. A notable example was the fan-made re-cut of John Carter based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs character. Michael Sellers, a fan of Burroughs' work, had been disappointed by the trailers Disney had released, including the one used during Super Bowl XLVI. He and his friend Mark Linthicum spent the evening after the Super Bowl downloading available material for the film and other works to piece together a more representative trailer of the source material; this caught not only the attention of the film's director Andrew Stanton, but of major media productions that praised the trailer's quality over Disney's own efforts. In a similar vein, the web series Honest Trailers from Screen Junkies similar remixes films to create trailers that sarcastically portray what happens in the film.

The seventh typhoon of the 1998 season, Babs formed on October 14 between the Philippines and Guam. The storm moved westward initially, failing to intensify initially due to the outflow from Typhoon Zeb to the northwest. Babs slowed and briefly turned to the south before advancing to the northwest, whereupon it rapidly intensified into a strong typhoon. On October 20, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making Babs an unofficial super typhoon. The storm struck the Philippine island of Catanduanes at that intensity and weakened slightly before hitting Luzon. Babs turned northward once in the South China Sea, later weakening due to unfavorable conditions and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 27 in the Taiwan Strait. Damage was heaviest where Babs first made landfall along the Philippine island of Catanduanes. Torrential rainfall rose waters by 9 m (30 ft) along a river, which inundated houses up to their roofs. Heavy rainfall affected much of Luzon and the northern Philippines, causing widespread flooding and landslides that isolated towns. Strong winds, peaking at 260 km/h (160 mph) in Virac, Catanduanes, left widespread areas without power. There was also heavy crop damage, with 222,882 tonnes of rice destroyed. Babs damaged or destroyed 403,623 houses in the Philippines, with overall damage estimated at ‚Ç±6.787 billion (Philippine peso, $159 million United States dollars); the typhoon also killed 303 people. Later, the storm's high waves injured surfers in Hong Kong. Heavy rainfall affected Fujian, causing ¬•280 million (Chinese yuan, $58 million USD) in damage and five deaths. Torrential rainfall in Taiwan, reaching in Yilan City, flooded towns and caused landslides; there were three deaths on the island. The remnants later affected the Japanese island of Okinawa with rainfall and high waves. Meteorological history A tropical disturbance developed east-southeast of Guam on October 11, just four days after Typhoon Zeb originated in the same area. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on October 12, indicating development was imminent. However, the system did not develop into a tropical depression until 06:00 UTC on October 14, based on analysis from the Japan Meteorological Agency - the official warning center for the western Pacific Ocean. Three hours later, the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Depression 20W. At that time, the storm had moved south of Guam and was passing north of Palau. The nascent depression moved generally westward toward the Philippines. Initially, development was hindered by the outflow from Typhoon Zeb, which had struck Luzon and was moving northward. However, the depression was able to intensify into a tropical storm on October 15, at which time the JTWC named it Babs. Later that day, the storm reached 1‚Äëminute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), and it entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA - the Philippine weather agency - which gave it the local name Loleng. On October 17, a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast weakened the subtropical ridge, causing Babs to slow and drift to the south; the same trough restricted outflow, causing the circulation to become exposed from the convection. The trough weakened and the shear decreased on October 18, allowing the storm to restrengthen. On October 19, a ship in the proximity of Babs reported 10‚Äëminute winds of 96 km/h (60 mph), indicating that the storm was intensifying. At 00:00 UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status, and the JMA followed suit 18 hours later. Babs rapidly intensified subsequently as it developed a well-defined eye 15 km (9 mi) in diameter. At 12:00 UTC on October 20, the JMA assessed that the typhoon reached peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), while the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making Babs an unofficial super typhoon. The gale-force winds extended 335 km (205 mi) northeast from the center, while the strongest winds extended 75 km (45 mi) from the eye. Around the time of peak intensity, Babs made landfall on the Philippine island of Catanduanes, where a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of in Virac. However, the official lowest pressure from the JMA was . The winds decreased slightly as Babs moved across Catanduanes, although it soon moved over open waters into Lamon Bay, where it struck Polillo Island. According to the JTWC, Babs had weakened to winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on October 22 before quickly re- intensifying to winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) as it approached Luzon. At 18:00 UTC on October 22, Babs made landfall on Luzon about 45 km (30 mi) south of Baler, or 185 km (115 mi) south of where Zeb struck only eight days prior. The typhoon weakened further while crossing central Luzon, and it passed about 75 km (45 mi) north of Metro Manila before emerging into the South China Sea on October 23. By that time, the JMA had downgraded Babs to a tropical storm, although the agency soon re-upgraded the storm to typhoon status. For several days, Babs remained at the same intensity, sporting an eye with a wide area of gale-force winds. A trough gradually steered the storm toward the north, weakening the ridge. The same trough caused an increase in wind shear that led to Babs weakening. The storm reached its westernmost point on October 25 - about 275 km (170 mi) southeast of Hong Kong. Turning northeastward into the Taiwan Strait, even stronger wind shear caused Babs to fall apart, and the storm weakened into a tropical depression just off the southeast coast of China. On October 27, the JMA declared Babs as extratropical. The remnants accelerated to the northeast, passing south of Kyushu before dissipating on October 30. Preparations Satellite image of Babs on October 20 Shortly after Babs entered the PAGASA area of responsibility, government workers began closely tracking the storm and warned residents to be prepared. PAGASA issued a Public Storm Warning Signal #4 for Catanduanes, with lower warnings issued throughout Luzon and the Visayas. Metro Manila was placed under Public Storm Warning Signal #3 on October 22. In Catanduanes, evacuees utilized public schools as an emergency shelter, although many rode out the storm in their homes. The storm halted ferry service throughout the region, stranding thousands. Many residents in Samar slept in buses and cars for two days due to the cancellations. Bus service to the region was also halted. The stock and currency exchanges were closed during the storm. Officials advised residents in Metro Manila to remain indoors; government buildings and schools were closed, while Ninoy Aquino International Airport halted all domestic flights. In addition, 14 international flights were canceled. Manila South Harbor also kept all boats at port. Across the Philippines, Babs forced about 400,000 people to leave their houses. Many families waited to evacuate until the onslaught of the strongest winds, resulting in additional casualties. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a warning signal #3 due to the storm's threat to the territory on October 24. Beaches closed during the storms, and fishing boats were forced to remain at port. Several airports in Taiwan were closed. Two Russian ships were forced to ride out the storm in Xiamen. Impact =Philippines= When Babs moved over Catanduanes, the weather station at Virac recorded wind gusts of 260 km/h (160 mph). In Daet, Camarines Norte, near the typhoon's final Philippine landfall, sustained winds reached 129 km/h (80 mph), with gusts to 185 km/h (115 mph). Farther north in Luzon, Babs produced gusts of 192 km/h (120 mph) in Baler, Aurora. The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall that caused flooding and landslides. On Mount Pinatubo, the rains resulted in a high landslide consisting of volcanic material, although nearby rivers at flood stage contained it. Workers at the Ambuklao and Binga dams had to release waters after the storm, which flooded rice fields and fish ponds along the Agno River. Elsewhere, heightened rivers in Camarines Sur flooded 24 towns. Five towns in Rizal province were flooded along a lake, including about 70% of the city of Angono. Flooding also affected portions of Manila. Just like Typhoon Zeb days earlier, Babs was very destructive to the Philippines, mostly throughout Luzon and into the Visayas. On Catanduanes where it first struck, several hours of torrential rainfall in the hills caused the Bato River to rise 9 m (30 ft), which reached as high as the houses' roofs in some areas. Most houses lost their roofs and many had damage to walls, with furniture and other property drenched. About 80% of the buildings in the city of Virac were destroyed, and winds were strong enough to knock air conditioners out of windows. There was an island-wide power outage after high seas washed away a power generating barge. On Masbate, a landslide collapsed the entrance of a gold mining cave, with 14 of the 25 member crew rescued. High waves destroyed 125 homes in Catbalogan on Samar Island, while three fishermen required rescue. Along its path through the Philippines, the high winds caused widespread power outages for several days. Many roads and highways were flooded for days or blocked by landslides, and several bridges were wrecked. In the Bicol Region of southern Luzon, the storm knocked over many coconut trees, and flooding damaged about of rice fields in Nueva Ecija. Nationwide, the storm destroyed 222,882 tonnes of rice. Agriculture damage was estimated at ‚Ç±2.3 billion (Philippine pesos, $54 million United States dollars). Overall, Babs destroyed 96,581 houses and damaged another 307,042, leaving about 130,000 people homeless. There were 303 deaths in the country with another 751 injured, mostly in the Bicol Region. This included 71 deaths on Catanduanes and 41 in Camarines Sur. Most of the deaths were related to landslides, flooding, electrocutions, snakebites, and cleanup accidents. On Catanduanes, residents dug mass graves due to the high number of fatalities. Total damage was estimated at ‚Ç±6.787 billion (PHP, $159 million USD), which as of 2011 was the 9th costliest typhoon in the Philippines and the 5th costliest at the time. =Elsewhere= Satellite image of Typhoon Babs in the South China Sea Due to the interaction between the monsoon and the storm, Babs produced gusty winds across Hong Kong, with a peak gust of recorded at two locations. The mountainous peak of Tate's Cairn recorded the highest sustained wind of . The winds were strong enough to knock down trees and damage scaffolding. Beaches were closed during the storm's passage, and boats rode out the storm at port. Precipitation from the typhoon fell over three days, reaching . Five surfers required rescues amid high seas, with a peak storm surge of . There were 14 injuries related to Babs in the territory. The dissipating remnants of Babs interacted with the winter monsoon to drop heavy rainfall on Taiwan, particularly in the northern and eastern portions of the island. Yilan City recorded over three days, and Hualien City recorded . One station recorded of rainfall in 24 hours. This led to flooding in eastern Taiwan, reaching waist-deep heights in some locations, which forced hundreds to leave their home. The rains also caused landslides that isolated villages, and a swollen Keelung River cut off two towns east of Taipei. The storm killed three people on the island, including a fishermen swept away by high waves, and a couple buried under a landslide. Across the Taiwan Strait, Babs killed five people and injured three others in the Chinese province of Fujian. In Zhangzhou, the storm damaged or destroyed 124 boats. Heavy rainfall destroyed 1,461 homes or greenhouses, with damage estimated at ¬•280 million (Chinese yuan, $58 million USD). Damage was concentrated in Fujian, with little effects reported in neighboring Jiangxi or Guangdong. The remnants also brought rainfall to southern Japan, including Okinawa, where precipitation reached in Yonagunijima. The same station recorded winds of 43 km/h (27 mph). High waves flooded a portion of Route 58 on Okinawa, damaging three vehicles and flooding 28 buildings. The storm also caused one landslide on the island. Aftermath A few days after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine president Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ‚Ç±200 million (PHP) in emergency funds. Estrada later released an additional ‚Ç±50 million (PHP) specifically for Catanduanes, as well as ‚Ç±10,000 sent to the family of each storm fatality. The Philippine Navy sent rubber boats to Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered agencies to work together to respond to the disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging. However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from unaffected areas were unable to travel due to the storm. After Babs passed the hardest hit areas, workers were initially unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000 sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000 tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500 people. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2 million to help 240,000 people.

It is a collection of Devo's music videos from 1976 to 1990. It was released on LaserDisc in 1993 by Voyager and on DVD by Rhino Records in 2003. MVD released a new version of the disc in 2014. Synopsis The Complete Truth About De-Evolution contains almost all of Devo's music video output from 1976 to 1990. The DVD does not include two notable music videos: the first is \\"Theme from Doctor Detroit,\\" the theme to the movie Doctor Detroit; the second is the Jimi Hendrix cover \\"R U Experienced?,\\" which was removed due to protests from the Hendrix estate. The films are presented in roughly chronological order and are interspersed with clips from a promotional film Devo made with Pioneer in the 1980s to promote the LaserDisc format. The DVD also includes many bonus features such as a commentary track by band members Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale, an interview with Chuck Statler (who directed many of Devo's videos), live footage from early Devo performances, photo galleries and more. None of the live material from \\"The Men Who Make The Music\\" is included, nor is most of the storyline from \\"We're All Devo!\\" Film title It is important to differentiate The Complete Truth About De-Evolution from The Truth About De- Evolution. The Truth About De-Evolution was a short film made by Devo in 1976 which included the videos for \\"Jocko Homo\\" and \\"Secret Agent Man\\". The Complete Truth About De-Evolution is the 1993 compilation of promotional videos.

Track order is otherwise the same. Bonus material Exclusive to the MVD DVD release is a lengthy roster of bonus material. Featured are the We're All Devo Big Entertainment segments featuring Rod Rooter, Donut, and Dr. Byrthfood and several minutes of live footage from the band's early, pre-Warner shows. Also present are written-word accounts from Casale and Mothersbaugh of the band's experiences with record labels and the recording of their first album, including photographs in automatic and manual slideshows. Promotions for The Men Who Make the Music and Devo Live 1980 DVDs are featured here also. \\"R U Experienced?\\" appears to be in the list, but it is simply the first few seconds of the video before the music starts, followed by a test card directing viewers to look for the full video online. The DVD retains the commentary track from the LaserDisc release, however, as \\"Theme from Doctor Detroit\\" was not present on LaserDisc, there is no commentary for that track (a fact conveyed to the viewer by a speech synthesizer). Rhino Records DVD controversy The Rhino Records DVD released in 2000 received much criticism from fans of the band. First, because of the aforementioned omission of the video for \\"R U Experienced?.\\" A comment on the back cover of the DVD addresses this: \\"DEVO regrets that 'R U Experienced?' is not included in the program. The current executors of the Jimi Hendrix estate were determined to prove to us the old adage - 'To seek permission is to seek denial'.\\" Other criticisms focused on the relatively poor mastering job. For example, Rhino simply recorded the gallery segments from the LaserDisc without making them seekable galleries. Similarly, each video's title screen was simply copied from the original LaserDisc, which means many of the chapter numbers listed on the title screens bear no relation to their chapter numbers on the DVD. Furthermore, there had been many delays in the DVD's release. However, the Rhino DVD does include the rare \\"Mongoloid,\\" video by Bruce Conner.

H. rubicundus was introduced into North America from the Old World during one of two main invasions of Halictus subgenera. These invasions likely occurred via the Bering land bridge at times of low sea level during the Pleistocene epoch. The species exhibits different social behaviors depending on climate: it is a solitary species in high elevations or latitudes where the season is short, but eusocial in other areas. Often, solitary and eusocial colonies appear simultaneously in the same population. These sweat bees are extensively studied for their variability in social behavior, which has become a model for social plasticity. This variability has contributed to an understanding of evolution of social behavior.Yanega, D. (1997) Demography and sociality in halictine bees (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). pp. 293-315 in Choe, J.C. & Crespi, B.J. (eds.) Social Competition and Cooperation in Insects and Arachnids: Vol. II. Evolution of Sociality. Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  Halictus rubicundus is a species of Hymenoptera in the bee family Halictidae, more commonly known as sweat bees. This common name comes from their frequent attraction to perspiration. This species exhibits polymorphic social behavior that varies with environmental conditions, and other species of the family Halictidae are thought to have similar variability in sociality.  Description and identification  A male on a flower Many members of the family Halictidae are metallic in appearance but Halictus rubicundus are not metallic. Females are about 1 cm in body length and brown in color, with fine white bands across the apices of the abdominal segments, and rusty-orange legs. The males are more slender, with longer antennae and yellow markings on the face and legs; they can be distinguished from males of similar species by the absence of an apical hair band on the terminal abdominal segment. In social populations, females of the first brood, mostly workers, can be recognized because they are typically slightly smaller than the foundresses.  Distribution and habitat  H. rubicundus has one of the widest natural distributions of any bee species, occurring throughout the temperate regions of the Holarctic region. It is believed that differences in climate across this vast range actually contribute to variation in their social behavior. Those living in more northern geographic locations or higher elevations are often more solitary in behavior than those in southern areas or lower elevations. This difference is widely studied, as it provides insight into the evolutionary transition from solitary to social behavior. Nests are haplometrotic, meaning that they are founded by single females. Social populations typically are found in warmer regions, such as Kansas, while solitary populations nest in cooler regions, such as Colorado, Scotland and Alaska. In intermediate regions, such as New York and southern Ontario, both social and solitary behavior can be found in different nests of the same population. The strictly solitary phenotype is expressed as a response to colder environments because the active season is not long enough to produce two broods.  Nesting  H. rubicundus burrow among pebbles, dug by a female Both solitary and eusocial types of the species typically excavate nest burrows in southward facing slopes in isolated areas, consisting of sand or soil. This slope maximizes the heat absorption from the sun, making the nest warmer. The nests with a favorable slope were thought to increase foraging efficiency of adults and development of larvae with a stable thermal environment. Stones or areas of vegetation are usually found near nest entrances, likely because of the heating properties of these objects. For each offspring, a females constructs a small underground chamber (a \\"brood cell\\"), into which she deposits several loads of pollen mixed with nectar, which is then formed into a ball; a single egg is laid upon this pollen mass, and then the brood cell is sealed. The female repeats the process with other brood cells, going progressively deeper into the soil. A higher temperature increases the rate at which the larvae develop to maturity, as thermal regulation is important for the development of both the eggs and the larvae. The nests can be up to 120 mm deep, and are constructed in a wide range of soil types. Because social nests produce more offspring than solitary nests, social nests will burrow further into the ground, as the second brood of the social population will extend the burrows downward. Females typically nest in dense aggregations, likely because the nesting females are relatives and demonstrate philopatric behavior.Yanega, D. (1990) Philopatry and nest founding in a primitively social bee, Halictus rubicundus. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 27: 37-42. =Soil hardness= The nests are typically burrowed into the ground in loam soil. Halictus rubicundus has a high tolerance for soil hardness. Soil hardness affects the density of nesting. Females prefer to nest in softer ground as they spend less energy and time excavating the nest. Unlike the similar species Lasioglossum zephyrus that build nests in very close proximity to each other, this species prefers less dense aggregations. Foundresses will choose to build their nests in patches of softer ground until they reach the critical nearest-neighbor distance of about 50 mm, at which point the close spacing poses a high risk of the nests collapsing. At this point, further foundresses would be forced to build their nests in harder soils where the nests could be built closer together without compromising nest architecture. Foundresses may test the hardness of the soil by biting into the surface or performing a short test dig. =Temperature= Nest temperature determines egg development and foraging active time of females. As long as temperatures do not reach lethal thresholds, developmental rates of offspring will increase with temperature. Higher temperatures will also increase the thoracic temperature and allow females to fly more rapidly. With increased speed in flight, females are allowed more time for foraging, mating, and excavating nests. Most nests of H. rubicundus are south facing and sloped because of this desire for increased temperature in nesting sites. Based on the distribution of this species, facing the south maximizes the period of time sunlight is shining directly on the nest. Sloping substrates increase the surface area of the nest and allow for higher absorption of sunlight. In order to test the temperature of the substrate, females often spend several seconds basking at various points on the ground while searching for nesting sites. =Soil water content= The water content of the substrate in which foundresses build the nest is important, as waterlogging must be avoided by using well-drained soils, which provides another advantage to building in sloping ground. However, there must be an adequate moisture level to prevent desiccation of the brood cells. Soil samples taken near the nests of H. rubicundus demonstrate a relatively high humidity. = Parasites = Halictus rubicundus nests are attacked by kleptoparasitic bees (e.g., Sphecodes), as well as flies (Bombyliidae, Anthomyiidae). Although it would seem as though nesting in dense groups would draw attention to aggregations and increase mortality by parasitism, such is not observed to be the case; because the sweat bees nest densely, it is assumed that there is a large dilution effect that proportionally decreases mortality rates by parasites.  Colony cycle and demographics  H. rubicundus‚Äôs annual colony cycle is dependent both on hibernation and mating schedules. After hibernation during the winter, female foundresses who mated the previous cycle emerge in the spring. They each create their own nests in late spring, where they rear a single brood. Females are more likely to build nests where there is a warmer surface temperature, as this indicates a warmer interior of the nest for the offspring to develop more quickly. The foundress gynes will continue to forage for 3‚Äì5 weeks, after which they will stop constructing and provisioning brood cells. The brood cells are left inactive for 1‚Äì2 weeks before the emergence of the first brood. The first brood typically emerges in June, and most females from the first brood will stay with their natal nest and act as foraging workers, provisioning for a second brood, on which the foundresses will resume laying eggs. Some females (the gynes) from the first brood, and all of the females from the second brood, will mate, disperse, and enter hibernation for the winter, and the colony cycle begins again the following spring. = Sociality Effects on Colony Cycle = The annual cycle differs slightly for eusocial and solitary populations, in terms of the number and sex ratios of offspring born in the broods. For example, in solitary populations, the first brood comprises 40% females, who are all able to mate before the next hibernation season. However, in eusocial populations, the emergence from hibernation occurs one or two months earlier, and results in a brood with mostly or exclusively worker females, with the female bias being greater the earlier nesting begins. Nesting for solitary populations begins in late May or June. The absence of a brood of female workers defines this nest type as solitary, so solitary populations produce only one reproductive brood that is provisioned by a gyne. The emergence of this brood is at approximately the same time as the emergence of the second or third brood in the social colony cycle. Upon emergence, the offspring mate and then females enter hibernation away from the nesting site. As in social colonies, the males and nest foundresses die at the end of the season. = Sex ratio variation = In social populations where there are two or more broods in one season, there are different sex ratios for each brood., and even variation between years, depending upon temperature (warmer years lead to increased male bias). The first brood will typically contain 75‚Äì100% females, most of which become workers, to help the mother produce a second brood. The final brood is slightly male-biased, typically with a sex ratio of about 60% males, and the females of the second brood are all gynes. The peak of male production strongly corresponds with photoperiod, such that eggs laid on or near the summer solstice are almost all male. In solitary populations, nesting begins later and only one brood is produced. The brood has a sex ratio made up of 60% males, similar to that of the final brood in social populations. This brood is also produced at about the same time that the final brood is produced in social populations so that the colony cycle ends at about the same time regardless of where the population lives. = Body size = Temperature affects not only the sex ratio, but also the size of offspring in the first brood of Halictus rubicundus, with warmer temperatures strongly correlated with larger offspring; there are various hypotheses that offer explanations as to why such is the case: * At optimum temperatures, the maximum offspring size will be produced. Smaller sizes will be the result of both higher and lower temperatures based on differing stresses. So varying conditions around one optimum temperature will lead to different offspring sizes. This hypothesis is not supported by existing data. * Low temperatures may reduce flowering, or reduce bees' ability to forage during the day, and therefore effect the rate of cell provisioning. If the rate of provisioning is lower, females may lay eggs on pollen masses before the mass reaches an optimal size. This hypothesis is supported by existing data. An offspring's size is not correlated with the size of their mother; foundress females that are smaller than the population average produce offspring that are larger than they are, and foundress females that are above the population average produce offspring that are smaller than they are. Once a nest contains workers, the size of offspring ceases to correlate with temperature, and instead correlates very strongly with the number of workers foraging for pollen, with the largest offspring (both males and females) being produced in nests with the greatest numbers of foragers.Yanega, D. (1996) Sex ratio and sex allocation in sweat bees (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). J. Kansas Ent. Soc. 69(4) Suppl.: 98-115.  Behavior  Halictus rubicundus is widely studied for their variability in behavior depending on geographic location, and with changes in temperature. Those at low elevations are known to exhibit eusocial behavior, while those at high elevations and latitudes are known to be solitary. = Dominance hierarchy = There is a caste system in H. rubicundus. The nest-founding females recruit their early-emerging daughters as workers, but later-emerging offspring mate prior to dispersal and hibernation. These behavioral categories are not thought to be genetically predetermined, but determined instead by mating behaviors and social factors in the first few days of adulthood. In this hierarchy, there is a foundress, which is a gyne that is always mated and starts her own colony after hibernation each cycle. She is considered the foundress queen if she is the one that established the nest, and recruits her daughters to act as workers. A gyne is any female that enters diapause, with the potential to become a nest foundress the following season. Below that is a non-gyne, which is a female who stays in an existing colony and may or may not reproduce. Within these non-gynes, there are some that are considered replacement queens, if they take the place of a dead foundress queen in the colony, but the majority are workers, who forage and maintain the colony. Replacement queens and workers appear to produce mostly male eggs, when they reproduce. Neither replacement queens nor workers enter hibernation, and die at the end of the season. = Division of labor = In eusocial colonies, there is a division of labor similar to that in other eusocial bees. In these colonies in New York, the first brood is primarily worker females, which in turn help the foundress rear her second brood, and a number of gynes and males. The second brood in New York yields only gynes and males, which breed to repeat the cycle. In Kansas, the first brood is exclusively worker females, and it is not until the second brood that gynes and males begin to appear, while the third brood is exclusively gynes and males. However, in non-eusocial nests within the New York populations, or at high elevation in Colorado, the brood contains only males and gynes. The cooperative breeding behavior of worker bees in eusocial colonies benefits the fitness of the foundress queen. They potentially benefit by helping their mother raise the second brood, according to the kin selection hypothesis. By assisting with foraging and feeding the larvae, as well as maintaining the proper functioning of the nest and colony, they help the second brood develop and reproduce to pass down the genes they share. However, in solitary nests, the offspring do not serve as workers and do not help the mother establish a second brood, but rather go off to try to establish nests of their own the following season. There is no evidence for predetermined morphological or physiological differences in caste for H. rubicundus. The differentiation into different castes is based on behavior. Females that do not mate immediately after emergence become workers or replacement queens while the others become gynes. The factor that may dictate whether a female mates is the relative abundance of males to newly emerged females; there is a higher percentage of gynes relative to non-gynes when males are relatively more abundant. This has population-level consequences in that during seasons where males are more abundant, a smaller proportion of nests contain eusocial colonies, and the average number of workers per nest is lower. = Mating behavior = Like most bee species, mating in H. rubicundus occurs on the ground or vegetation in and around the nest aggregation. Males may hover around their natal nest and wait to encounter females that are entering or leaving a surrounding nest. Gynes are those females that leave the nest site after mating and enter a dormant state (diapause), and restart the cycle the following spring, while worker females, if they mate, remain in the natal nest. In this species, there are foundress gynes and non-gynes (who can be replacement queens or workers). The gynes and non-gynes are distinct groups, as gynes mate, do not work, and enter diapause (to become foundresses), while non-gynes work and do not diapause. There is evidence that male abundance may be the factor triggering this distinction early in life; if there is an abundance of males, a virgin female is more likely to encounter males and mate early shortly after emergence, and make a caste switch into being a gyne.Yanega, D. (1992) Does mating determine caste in sweat bees? (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). J. Kansas Ent. Soc. 65(3): 231-237. If she is left unmated for two or three days, however, she will likely stay a non-gyne, even if she mates later on; no female who began acting as a worker (pollen-collecting behavior, typically starting within two or three days after emergence) was ever found to return the following season. Halictus rubicundus is the first bee species documented to have mixed broods containing both gynes and non-gynes, and it was previously thought that non-gynes and gynes were always produced in separate broods. = Sex ratio effects on sociality = Male abundance appears to have a major effect on deciding the social behavior within a population; the best predictor for a female's fate (future foundress gyne versus worker non-gyne) is the relative male abundance in proportion to virgin females on the first day a given virgin female emerges as an adult (i.e., if there are 10 males and 10 virgin females on one day, each female has a 50% chance of becoming a gyne, but if the following day there are 15 males and only 5 virgin females, then 75% of those females will become gynes). Warmer temperatures during the first brood provisioning phase in the spring leads to a higher ratio of male to female offspring, and a significantly lower proportion of females are recruited as workers, reducing the overall level of sociality expressed in that population, ranging from above 75% in some years to below 45% in others, in the same location. Sex ratio is also affected by photoperiod at the time of egg production, with eggs laid on or near the summer solstice being almost exclusively male, so the earlier the season starts, the more female-biased the early brood phase will be, as in Kansas, where there are no males produced at all in the first brood, and there are three broods annually. = Nest-site fidelity = Nest-site fidelity may be due to one of three reasons, or a combination: #Philopatry is the tendency for adult bees to excavate a nest near their natal nest; in H. rubicundus, females returning from overwintering sites typically excavate burrows within 30 cm of the location of their natal nest. Returning to the vicinity of the natal nest is beneficial because the site must have been successful enough to produce adults for one year. This prevents H. rubicundus from taking the risk of settling in a poor location for brood rearing. #Habitat learning describes the process through which females recognize characteristics of the nest from which she came and chooses to nest in similar conditions. Although this is different from philopatry in that she will not purposely choose to be near her previous nest and will make selections based on environmental factors, the nest the female chooses will often still be near her original nest. #Social facilitation may influence the nesting location chosen by a female because the benefits of nesting close to other bees may outweigh the costs of finding a new location with a suitable substrate. = Gregarious nesting = Dense nesting tendencies of H. rubicundus are most likely due to the following three factors: # There is a limited amount of suitable substrate in which the bees can build their nests, so they must build many nests packed tightly together without compromising the structural integrity of the nest. # As mentioned earlier, philopatry is an important factor in maintaining an aggregation. The search for a new nesting site requires a lot of resources, so females will likely limit their dispersal and stay near their natal nest sites. # Hymenopteran and dipteran species may attack the ground nest of H. rubicundus. Although it would seem that aggregation of nesting would increase the mortality due to parasitism as they would be more conspicuous, it is likely that there is a dilution effect that reduce mortality by parasitism. = Pheromone recognition = Halictid bees have a gland known as the Dufour‚Äôs gland that extends throughout the abdomen. It is found primarily in female Hymenoptera. The Dufour‚Äôs gland, which is associated with the sting structure, secretes fluids that are important for socioecological functioning. In H. rubicundus, the Dufour‚Äôs gland produces pheromones that may aid females in recognizing brood cells as well as other individuals in the nest.  Kin selection  = Genetic relatedness within colonies = Following standard models, it is assumed that worker bees who help their mother raise the following brood are in a position to benefit from the effects of kin selection. Females within the first brood therefore that stays in the colony, and are directly genetically related to their mother by half, are able to help to raise a second brood containing sisters, which are also (due to haplodipoidy) related to them by half. = Genetic relatedness among colonies of different behaviors = There is evidence for greater genetic relatedness between two colonies with similar behavioral patterns (either eusocial or solitary), than between those of closer geographic distance but different social behaviors. This does not necessarily mean that social behavior is governed by certain genes, but it could be linked to certain genetic lineages that are more suited for certain environments. Empirical data from within a single population, however, indicates that females who do not remain as workers in their mother's nest are not more likely to have daughters that similarly depart. Although there is only limited research to date on the correlation between genetics, the environment, and social behavior, there is ample evidence that there are links between these three factors. The differences between the populations of H. rubicundus exhibiting solitary behavior, and those exhibiting eusocial behavior could be the result of environmental control of sociality, rather than having a purely genetic explanation. = Costs and benefits of sociality = In environments with short breeding seasons, sociality is not expected because there is no benefit to acting as a worker in the absence of an opportunity to produce another brood that season, and no potential for kinship selection benefits. Populations in environments that allow for multiple broods exhibit eusocial behavior, and there are potential benefits to worker behavior in eusocial colonies, as workers are related to the foundress (their mother) and the brood (their sisters, in particular). Under theories of inclusive fitness, it is potentially beneficial for workers to help their mother produce a second brood if that brood is primarily female. However, H. rubicundus does not show female bias in the second brood, with values only ranging to a maximum of 40% female. Furthermore, the one study providing empirical data for H. rubicundus shows that a typical worker contributes to the production of 0.9 sisters and 0.8 brothers, far below the threshold for inclusive fitness effects to favor helping, but above the threshold at which their mother benefits directly; as such, this species provides evidence that kin selection effects would not apply to this species, and instead suggests that mothers manipulate some of their daughters into acting as workers because of direct gains to maternal fitness, even though these manipulated daughters have lower fitness than they could have had if they had been gynes.

As consumption of seedless fruits is generally easier and more convenient, they are considered commercially valuable. Most commercially produced seedless fruits have been developed from plants whose fruits normally contain numerous relatively large hard seeds distributed throughout the flesh of the fruit.Frost, H. B., Soost, R. K. (1968) \\"Seed reproduction: development of gametes and embryos\\". In: Reuther, W. Webber, H. J., Batchelor, L. D. (eds) The Citrus Industry, vol.

(1991) Embryogenesis in vitro and nonchimeric tetraploid plant recovery from undeveloped Citrus ovules treated with colchicine. J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci 116: 317-321Soost, R. K., Cameron, J. W. (1985) \\"'Melogold' a triploid Pummelo-grapefruit hybrid. HortScience 20 :1134-1135  Varieties  Common varieties of seedless fruits include watermelons, tomatoes, grapes (such as Termarina rossaJ. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 1047 Allen Lane 2012 ), and bananas. Additionally, there are numerous seedless citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons and limes. The term \\"seedless fruit\\" is biologically somewhat contradictory, since fruits are usually defined botanically as mature ovaries containing seeds. Seedless fruits can develop in one of two ways: either the fruit develops without fertilization (parthenocarpy), or pollination triggers fruit development, but the ovules or embryos abort without producing mature seeds (stenospermocarpy). Seedless banana and watermelon fruits are produced on triploid plants, whose three sets of chromosomes make it very unlikely for meiosis to successfully produce spores and gametophytes. This is because one of the three copies of each chromosome can't pair with another appropriate chromosome before separating into daughter cells, so these extra third copies end up randomly distributed between the two daughter cells from meiosis 1, resulting in the (usually) swiftly lethal aneuploidy condition. Such plants can arise by spontaneous mutation or by hybridization between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same or different species. Some species, such as tomato, pineapple, and cucumber, produce fruit in which there is no seed to be found if not pollinated but will produce seeded fruit if pollination occurs. Lacking seeds, and thus the capacity to propagate via the fruit, the plants are generally propagated vegetatively from cuttings, by grafting, or in the case of bananas, from \\"pups\\" (offsets). In such cases, the resulting plants are genetically identical clones. By contrast, seedless watermelons are grown from seeds. These seeds are produced by crossing diploid and tetraploid lines of watermelon, with the resulting seeds producing sterile triploid plants. Fruit development is triggered by pollination, so these plants must be grown alongside a diploid strain to provide pollen. Triploid plants with seedless fruits can also be produced using endosperm culture for the regeneration of triploid plantlets from endosperm tissue via somatic embryogenesis. One disadvantage of most seedless crops is a significant reduction in the amount of genetic diversity in the species. As genetically identical clones, a pest or disease that affects one individual is likely capable of affecting each of its clones. For example, the vast majority of commercially produced bananas are cloned from a single source, the Cavendish cultivar, and those plants are currently threatened worldwide by a newly discovered fungal disease to which they are highly susceptible.

The floors, or sections of the floor, were sometimes mirrored. Customers order drinks and snacks, and generally touch the staff. The shops otherwise look like normal coffee shops, rather than sex establishments, although they charged a premium price for the coffee. Previously, most sex establishments had been establishments, such as soaplands and pink salons, with professional prostitutes. No-pan kissa were a popular employment choice amongst some women because they paid well and generally required little sexual contact with the customers. The first one to open was in Osaka in 1980. Initially, all of them were in remote areas outside the traditional entertainment districts. Within a year, large numbers had opened in many more places, such as major railway stations. In the 1980s (the peak of the boom in these shops), many started to have topless or bottomless waitresses. However, at this point, the number of such shops started to decline rapidly. Eventually, such coffee shops gave way to fashion health (massage) clubs and few no-pan kissa, if any, remain. The New Amusement Business Control and Improvement Act came into force on February 13, 1985, which further restricted the sex industry and protected the more traditional businesses. In addition to no-pan kissa, there have also been no- pan shabu-shabu and no-pan karaoke. References * Akira Suei, \\"The Lucky Hole as the Black Hole\\" in Nobuyoshi Araki, Tokyo Lucky Hole, .

She was very close to her sister Maria Shirreff (later Grey), with whom she collaborated with on educational and writing projects. =Education= Emily and her sisters were educated from an early age by a French governess called Adele Piqet, who had a limited education. In the 1820s the family lived in France where the father was stationed. Emily was a bright scholar at an early age but after suffering from a severe illness at the age of seven she had to relearn the alphabet. Emily suffered from ill health for the rest of her life. At the age of 14 she was sent to a boarding school in Paris but the rough conditions at the school affected Emily's poor health and she was removed a year later. In 1829, her father took command of HMS Warspite and moved his family to Avranche in Lower Normandy. In 1831 her father was appointed to Gibraltar and did not think it his daughters needed another governess, bringing their formal education to an end. Maria and Emily continued to improve their education through ‚Äòself-improvement‚Äô by travelling extensively to France, Spain and Italy, reading in their father's extensive library, and became acquainted with many intellectuals of the age through their father's contacts. =Early writings= Emily and Maria first began to write together when Mrs Shirreff brought her daughters back to England in 1834. Their first publication, Letters from Spain and Barbary, was published in 1835. Though Maria was married in 1841, the two sisters continued to write together and anonymously published a romantic novel, Passion and Principle. In 1850, they published Thoughts on Self-Culture Addressed to Women, in which they disapproved of traditional girls' education which only trained women to be dependent on men and not teach them to think for themselves. In 1858, Shirreff published her first major solo work Intellectual Education and its Influence on the Character and Happiness of Women, which further highlighted Emily's belief that women should not be educated as 'man's subordinate'. =Educational work= In the 1870s, the sisters actively turned their attention to promoting education. Emily helped raise funds for the North London Collegiate School and continued to write papers on women's education. She was the second mistress of Girton College, CambridgeGirton College Register, 1869‚Äì1946: Cambridge; CUP; 1948 succeeding Charlotte Manning who served for only a term. Shirreff remained connected to the College until her death. Emily was one of the founders of the Froebel Society and was its president from 1876 until her death. She also wrote many articles and booklets on kindergarten education. Emily was also the vice-president of the Parents‚Äô National Union. In 1871, with her sister, Mary Gurney, Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley, and the support of HRH Princess Louise, Emily founded the National Union for the Improvement of the Education of Women of all Classes, (also known as the Women's Education Union). Emily was heavily involved in the work of the union as its honorary secretary and co-editor of its journal, the Journal of the Women‚Äôs Education Union. The Union also found the Girls‚Äô Public Day School Company in 1872, which opened secondary schools for girls which offered the same educational opportunities as boys‚Äô schools, and still operates today as the Girls' Day School Trust. She was very active on the Council of the Company and was made a vice-president in 1896. Emily was also involved in the Union's foundation of an evening college for women and the teachers training and registration society. =Other interests= The Chivalry of the South published for the Ladies' London Emancipation Society Emily was also interested in other areas of research and supported women's suffrage. Her opposition of the continuation of the use of slaves in southern US was aired in her 1864 paper, The Chivalry of the South. In 1874 she joined the Women's Peace and Arbitration Auxiliary, (later the London Peace Society). She also wrote a biographical sketch of Henry Thomas Buckle, who had been a close friend, for a posthumous edition of his works in 1872. =Later life= Emily had suffered from ill health all her life and became less active towards the end of her life She died in London on 20 March 1897 and was buried in Brompton cemetery.

Family background In the lead up to the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 King Richard III appointed Sir William Alington of Horseheath, Knt., his Commissioner of Array for Cambridgeshire. He made his last will on 15 August and was killed fighting alongside John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. His son and heir was Sir Giles Alington (1483‚Äì1522), a Knight of the Bath and twice High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, who had married Mary Gardiner, daughter & heiress of Sir Richard Gardiner, (died 1489) Lord Mayor of London by his spouse Audria, daughter of William Cotton, Lord of Landwade Manor, Cambridgeshire. The Alingtons who dwelt at Horseheath Hall thrived under the Tudor and Stuart monarchs, and had the privilege of handing to the King his first drink at coronations. Sir Giles Alington was one of the party attending Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold tournament in 1520. Biography Sir Giles Alington jnr. was the eldest son of the eleven children of Sir Giles (1483-1522) and Mary. He was knighted by King Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace, London, on 11 November 1530. He attended the King as Master of Ordnance at the siege of Boulogne-sur-Mer, noted on the inscription of a clock which he brought from that siege, and affixed over the offices at Horseheath Hall, in which was contained the alarm bell of the garrison of Boulogne. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in the 22nd year of the reign of Henry VIII (1531) and again in the 37th year (1546) of the same monarch. He was returned to Parliament as knight of the shire (MP) for Cambridgeshire in 1529, 1539, 1554 and 1558 and also for Liverpool in 1553. The Alingtons lived at Horseheath Hall for centuries. The house was rebuilt in 1663‚Äì1665 by architect Sir Roger Pratt; (Vitruvius Britannicus is wrong in assigning the house to Webb). It was a neo-classical eleven-bay house with a three-bay pediment, quoins, hipped roof, balustrade and belvedere on the roof. It was further enlarged in 1688, but for reasons now unknown pulled down in 1777. The splendid wrought-iron gates went to St John's College and Trinity College Cambridge, and the rectory at Cheveley. Marriages Sir Giles Alington was married three times and outlived his son and heir. \\"The [1st] marriage, between Ursula daughter of Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead in the County of Suffolk, knight, Privy Councillor\\" and \\"Sir Gyles Alington of Horseheath in the countie of Cambridge\\" is recorded on the tomb on their grandson, James Alington, in Milden parish church, Suffolk. By Ursula Drury (died 1523) Sir Giles had a son and heir, Sir Robert, Knt., (1520‚Äì1552), and a daughter who married John Spencer of Althorp. His second marriage was to Alice Middleton (died before 1564), to whom he had a further five children, including Sir Richard Alington, later Master of the Rolls, (a magnificent monument to Sir Richard is in the Rolls Chapel, Chancery Lane, London). He married [3] by licence dated 1564, Margaret Talkorne (died 1586), who survived him. In his Will he mentions a worry:-\\"touching and concerninge the marriage betwene my foresaid nephew [sic; this should read grandson] Giles Alington and Margarett Ellington his Daughter which God is my witness I concluded and made with Sir John Spencer, rather for the goodwill and affection I bore unto him than for the profit. ... and could have had more by a thousand pounds ...\\". Sir John Spencer was left his \\"best gowne of velvett furred with marteins\\" provided he ceased pressure for more than Sir Giles thought \\"kindlie and frindlie.\\" His second wife Alice was the stepdaughter of Sir Thomas More.p.384, Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn There are several Alington memorials within Horseheath parish church including a tomb of Sir Giles (died 1586) who lies in splendour with one of his sons, one above the other, both in armour, heads on helmets and feet on hounds. There is in addition a brass to Sir Robert Alington, Knt., (d.22 May 1552) who predeceased his father. There is also another Giles Alington of Shakespeare's day on an impressive alabaster monument with his wife and their six children, he in slashed breeches and armour, she in a ruff and hooped skirt.

Dillingham Charles Bancroft Dillingham (May 30, 1868 ‚Äì August 30, 1934) was an American theatre manager and producer of over 200 Broadway shows. Biography Charles Bancroft Dillingham was born on May 30, 1868 in Hartford, Connecticut to Edmund Bancroft Dillingham, an Episcopalian clergyman and Josephine Potter. He graduated from the Hartford schools and went to work for a newspaper in Hartford, which sent him to Washington D.C. as a correspondent. He then went to Chicago where he joined the staff of the Chicago Times-Herald. He subsequently moved to New York City and was hired by The Evening Sun for $15 per week. He became a theater critic for the New York Post. In 1896 he wrote a play \\"Ten P.M.\\" which was produced at the Bijou Theater. The producer Charles Frohman saw it and offered Dillingham a job as a advertising agent. They formed a theatrical alliance and a friendship that lasted until Frohman died in the 1915 sinking of the RMS Lusitania. After leaving the employ of Frohman he formed the Dillingham Theatre Corporation. He also was associated over many years with A. L. Erlanger and Florenz Ziegfeld. The three were the principals of the A.L. Erlanger Amusement Enterprises, Inc. The 1936 Academy Award for Best Picture Winner The Great Ziegfeld told the story not only of Ziegfeld but also of Dillingham although it used the name \\"Billings\\" for Dillingham' likely due to Dillingham estate issues in which the Ziegfeld estate was owed money by the bankruptcy of Dillingham in 1933. Dillingham was also the owner of the Hippodrome, which in its time was the largest theatrical venue in the world. There he produced ice skating spectacles and competitions, dance stars such as Anna Pavlova, and it is where 'Poor Butterfly' was first heard. On January 10,1910 he opened the Globe Theatre (now known as the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre) at Broadway and 46th Street which was the first ever theater venue with a retractable roof. Dillingham also introduced and managed dozens of star actors including Julia Marlowe and Ruby Keeler. Productions Julia Marlowe in The Cavalier (1902) Dillingham began his producing career in 1902, with a production of The Cavalier, starring Julia Marlowe, William Lewers and Frank Worthing. His other noteworthy productions include the following: *The Little Princess, 1903 *Miss Dolly Dollars, 1905 *The Echo, 1910 *Miss 1917, 1917 *A Bill of Divorcement, featuring Katharine Cornell, in 1921 *Good Times, 1920 *Bulldog Drummond, 1921 *Peter Pan, 1924 *The Little Minister, 1925 *Sidewalks of New York, featuring Ruby Keeler, 1927 *Waterloo Bridge, 1930 He also produced several musicals and musical reviews during his career, including Watch Your Step, the first musical by Irving Berlin (which featured Vernon and Irene Castle in their Broadway debut). In 1915, Dillingham hired the Russian prima ballerina Anna Pavlova to perform in New York City for six months. Personal life Dillingham was married in 1896 to actress and singer Jennie Yeamans who was a former child star. She died in 1906. On May 5, 1913 in Purchase, New York he married Eileen Ann Kearney formerly of Stillwater, Minnesota. The new Mrs. Dillingham was part of the Alla Nazimova dance troupe and later was in several productions of Dillingham's. The couple lived at 153 East Sixty-third Street in a home later owned by the artist Jasper Johns and then the film director Spike Lee.https://ny.curbed.com/2014/1/7/10157490/step-inside-spike-lees- historic-townhouse-listed-for-32m The couple were regulars in society just as the old guard and the theater world began mingling. They were among the early snowbirds fleeing to Palm Beach during the winter season. They were often at European social scenes such as the Ascot and Longchamp racecourses. The marriage broke up in August of 1924 after Mrs. Dillingham became enamored of Julius Broome Livingston Allen, twelve years her junior, whom she married in October of that year. The divorce caused a sensation and was reported in Time magazine. Eileen was a life long friend of Florenz Ziegfeld's wife the actress Billie Burke. She died in 1957 after divorcing her second husband, whom she had married twice. There have been various reports and rumors of Dillingham's homosexuality including a longtime relationship with Charles Frohman, with whom he lived for some time between his marriages. His second wife's family believed theirs to be a marriage of convenience. He was considered a gentleman of the old school, good-natured, having a good sense of humor, well-dressed and always kept farce, vulgarity, exhibitionism and hints of impropriety out of his productions, befitting the son of a clergyman. He was a pall bearer at Harry Houdini's funeral where he was thought to have quipped, \\"Let's see him get out of this one.\\" Ill health and the stock market crash of 1929 forced Dillingham to give up producing. The writer Damon Runyon mentioned him in a short essay called ‚ÄòA Dog‚Äôs Best Friend‚Äô: ‚Äú‚ÄùDamon, what becomes of a man's friends when he gets sick?\\" I could not answer that one. It reminded me of a somewhat similar question asked by the once great theatrical producer, Charles Dillingham, at a time when he was broke and commencing to be forgotten along the big street, of which he was once one of the most glamorous and successful figures. He was sitting on a stool at a drugstore lunch counter when a gabby guy who knew who he was took the stool beside him and began babbling. \\"I wonder what's become of so-and-so?\\" he finally wondered, naming a Broadwayfarer who had sunk into obscurity. \\"I don't know\\", said Dillingham, adding thoughtfully, \\"I wonder what's become of Dillingham?\\"‚Äù Dillingham died of bronchopneumonia on August 30, 1934 at the Hotel Astor where he lived. He was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford and was survived by his sister Mabel Ballard Dillingham Newton and her daughter Marjory Newton Nolan.

Biography Edward Harwood was born at Hoddlesden, near Darwen, Lancashire, in 1707. His early training was as a hand-loom weaver, but he subsequently became a professional musician in Liverpool. His first collection of psalmody, A set of hymns and psalm tunes, was published in London in 1781, and a second collection, entitled A Second Set of Hymns and Psalm Tunes was published at Chester in 1786. He died in 1787. Vital Spark Harwood's setting of Pope's ode Vital spark of heav'nly flame was first published in Harwood's A set of hymns and psalm tunes: it is written in the style of a glee, and in the original publication is written for the most part for three voices (two trebles and bass), with a fourth (tenor) part being added for the last few bars only. It was, however, often arranged for the more usual four part-choir. The piece was very popular in the first half of the 19th century, being widely sung among Anglicans, Methodists and dissenters, and Lightwood noted in 1935 that it 'certainly had a long and prosperous run, and even now it is not quite extinct'. However, it was not always a great favourite with the clergy, whose objections were mainly to do with the text, which is not explicitly religious (also, it's a poem written by a Catholic, after the last words of the Emperor Hadrian).

Previously Chair of English at the University of Surrey and professor and head of English at Bangor University, he was elected by-fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge in 2005. Edwards received an M.A and Ph.D. in English from the Universit√© de Montr√©al, where he completed his doctoral dissertation on 19th- and early 20th-century U.S. travel literature. Between 1995 and 2005, he taught at the Universit√© de Montr√©al and the University of Copenhagen, where he was appointed as an associate professor in 2002. He holds an Affiliate Professorship in U.S. Literature at the University of Copenhagen and in 2016-2017 he was a Fulbright scholar at Elon University, North Carolina. Gothic literature Edwards' contribution to the study of gothic literature started with Gothic Passages: Racial Ambiguity and the American Gothic, which examines the development of U.S. gothic literature alongside 19th-century discourses of passing and racial ambiguity. This book focused on the way in which writers of the period \\"gothicized\\" biracial and passing figures in order to frame them within the rubric of a demonization of difference. In Gothic Canada: Reading the Spectre of a National Literature, he continued in the area by examining how collective stories about national identity and belonging tend to be haunted by artifice. Post-colonialism His work in the field of postcolonialism, growing out of his work on travel writing started with Exotic Journeys: Exploring the Erotics of U.S. Travel Literature, which examines the place of travel writing in the rhetoric of imperial expansion and colonial ideology. In this project, he focused on representations of sexuality and eroticism in 19th- and early 20th-century U.S. travel literature to capture defining moments in the formation of an American national identity. This book led to a collaborative work compiling an anthology of Asian and African travel literature, Other Routes: 1500 Years of African and Asian Travel Writing, which collects primary pieces by travel writers from Asia and Africa stretching from the fifth to the 19th centuries.

Numerous poetic and other literary works were dedicated to her, like Johann George Moeresius who wrote a series of poems in her honour. In 1626, the Milanese publisher Filippo Lomazzo compiled and published the musical anthology Flores praestantissimorum virorum a Philippo Lomatio Bibliopola delibati. It is preceded by a page-long dedication ad nobilissiam Constantiam Czirenbergiam Gedanensiam. In the dedication, she is praised for her musical talent, especially for her singing, which was recognized and admired by the most accomplished musicians and royalty of her time.

The game is based on parts of the movie Bionicle: Mask of Light and other parts of the Bionicle storyline. Initially, the game was supposed to make each Toa, Toa Nuva, and the Toa of Light playable, but due to deadlines, much of the game was dropped. However, all of the characters are playable in the Game Boy Advance version. The Mac OS X version of the game was released by Feral Interactive.  Story  The game follows the 2001-2003 storyline with only one obvious omission; the first part of the 2001 story, when the Toa first face Makuta, was cut out. However, many parts of the story were \\"reduced.\\" The game begins when the Bohrok are attacking Mata Nui, and spends two levels depicting Tahu and Kopaka's battles with them. After that, the game moves on to Gali Nuva's level, in which the Bohrok-Kal are introduced, and all defeated at once by Gali. In the storyline, Tahu Nuva uses the Kanohi Vahi, mask of time, to allow himself and the other five Toa to defeat them. Pohatu's level then depicts a \\"midpoint\\" between storylines; Pohatu is delivering the news that the Rahkshi have awakened to Onua. Onua then defeats Lerahk in his level by dropping a hub unit on Lerahk, Lewa fights Panrahk in his level, and Tahu lava-surfs after Kurahk, who has made off with the Mask of Light. When he catches Kurahk, the Mask of Light fuses itself to Takua, who becomes Takanuva (Takua Nuva in the game) and defeats Makuta, Lord of Shadows, in the game's final level. He transforms into Takutanuva and opens the door and awakes Mata Nui. The Turaga and Matoran only make a couple appearances, none of which are very significant to the plot.  Gameplay  Basic controls include using shields and light elemental blasts to defeat enemies and open canisters. Overall, there are 8 levels in the game including the boss battle against Makuta.  Reception  Bionicle received mixed reviews from critics. It was given a 3.8 out of ten by IGN, and a 6.5 by Game Informer. It was criticized for repetitive and simplistic gameplay, story, poor visuals, short length and complete lack of innovation. Game Informer stated that it would only be appropriate for \\"Lego-obsessed 8-year-olds\\".

It is intended to show how the different SCSI standards are inter-related. The main concepts and terminology of the SCSI architectural model are: * Only the externally observable behavior is defined in SCSI standards. * The relationship between SCSI devices is described by a client- server service-delivery model. The client is called a SCSI initiator and the server is called a SCSI target. * A SCSI domain consists of at least one SCSI device, at least one SCSI target and at least one SCSI initiator interconnected by a service delivery subsystem. * A SCSI device has one or more SCSI ports, and a SCSI port may have an optional SCSI port identifier (SCSI ID or PID). * A SCSI device can have an optional SCSI device name which must be unique within the SCSI domain in which the SCSI device has SCSI ports. This is often called a World Wide Name. Note that the \\"world\\" may only consist of a very small number of SCSI devices. * A SCSI target consists of one or more logical units (LUNs), which are identified by logical unit numbers. * A LUN may have dependent LUNs embedded within it. This can recur up to a maximum nesting depth of four addressable levels. * There are three type of SCSI ports: initiator ports, target ports and target/initiator ports. A SCSI device may contain any combination of initiator ports, target ports and target/initiator ports. * SCSI distributed objects are considered to communicate in a three layer model: ** The highest level of abstraction is the SCSI Application Layer (SAL) where an initiator and a target are considered to communicate using SCSI commands sent via the SCSI application protocol. ** The SCSI Transport Protocol Layer (STPL) is where an initiator and a target are considered to communicate using a SCSI transport protocol. Examples of SCSI transport protocols are Fibre Channel, SSA, SAS, UAS, iSCSI and the SCSI Parallel Interface. ** The lowest level is the SCSI Interconnect Layer (SIL) where an initiator and a target are considered to communicate using an interconnect. It consists of the services, signaling mechanism and interconnect subsystem used for the physical transfer of data from an initiator to a target. * A SCSI task is represented by an I_T_L_Q nexus. This is where one Initiator Port talks to one Target Port, addressing one LUN and together they execute one task (identified by Q).

Other than Bedford himself, notable members included John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich; Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Gower; Richard Rigby, who served as principal Commons manager for the group; Thomas Thynne, 3rd Viscount Weymouth; Edward Thurlow; and George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough History The Bedfordites emerged as a specific faction in the wake of Bedford's dismissal as Secretary of State in 1751. Initially, Bedford opposed the ministry, dominated by the Old Corps Whigs led by Prime Minister Henry Pelham and his brother the Duke of Newcastle. Following Pelham's death in 1754, Bedford aligned himself with Henry Fox, and after Fox became Secretary of State in late 1755, some of Bedford's followers accepted jobs in the new administration. When the Devonshire-Pitt ministry was formed in November 1756, Bedford gave it his blessing by accepting the post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and continued in that office in the Newcastle-Pitt ministry which followed. =Role in the Seven Years' War= Over the course of the Seven Years' War, however, Bedford came into considerable disagreement with Pitt on the conduct of the war. In 1760‚Äì1761, despite his doubts about the constitutionality of the influence the new king George III's favorite, the Earl of Bute, Bedford generally allied himself to Bute in Cabinet in order to advocate for peace. Bedford played a significant role in bringing about Pitt's fall, and himself served as the principal peace negotiator for Britain at the Paris Peace Conference of 1762‚Äì1763. After Bute's resignation in April 1763, Bedford and his supporters, who now felt that accommodation with the Old Corps Whigs was the best way forward, refused to support the new government of George Grenville, but following the death of the Earl of Egremont in September 1763, he changed his mind, and Bedford and his followers obtained many of the key ministerial posts in the Grenville government ‚Äì Bedford himself was Lord President, Marlborough was Lord Privy Seal, Sandwich was Secretary of State, Gower was Lord Chamberlain, and Weymouth was Master of the Horse. The King's increasing distaste for Bedford, in particular, helped bring about the fall of the Grenville ministry in July 1765, and when a new ministry led by Lord Rockingham and dominated by the remnants of the Old Corps Whigs came to power, Bedford and his followers went into opposition. The Bedfordites supported a hard-line policy in North America, and thus opposed the Rockingham ministry's repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766. When Rockingham's ministry fell in 1766, Bedford hoped to make an alliance with the new Chatham ministry, while his lieutenant Richard Rigby wished to stay in opposition along with the Grenvillites. In the end, the King's opposition to the Bedfordites meant that they stayed out, and thus the Chatham ministry was opposed by three distinct parliamentary factions ‚Äì the Grenvillites, the Rockinghamites, and the Bedfordites. Notably, the Rockinghamites opposed the ministry as pursuing too hard-line a policy on North America, while Bedford and his followers felt the opposite. Nevertheless, the two factions came close to agreeing to form a coalition before disagreements about who the Leader of the Commons should be. =American Revolution and decline= Nevertheless, the strength of the opposition forces convinced the Duke of Grafton, who had succeeded Chatham as effective Prime Minister, that some effort must be made to bring the Bedfords into the government. This was successfully accomplished in December 1767, when Gower became Lord President and, shortly thereafter, Weymouth was made Secretary of State. Bedford himself, who was in ill-health, did not take office, and gradually withdrew from public life until his death in 1771, but the faction survived him, now led by Gower. They continued to support a hard- line policy towards the Americas, which ultimately led to the American Revolutionary War in 1775. Gower and many of the other Bedfordites resigned from the North government in late 1779 due to what they saw as North's ineffectual leadership of the war effort, but others, including Sandwich and Thurlow, stayed on. Gower continued to lead the main body of the Bedford faction, however, which finally entered the government in December 1783 as supporters of Pitt the Younger. After this, the Bedfordites ceased to be a distinguishable political faction. On the whole, neither contemporaries nor historians have looked on the Bedford faction with great favor ‚Äì they have traditionally been seen as essentially rapacious job-seekers, willing to sell themselves to the highest bidder in exchange for positions. More recent scholarship has been less negative. In his article about Bedford for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Martyn Powell contends that accusations of opportunism are unfair, and that flexibility was necessary for a relatively small party like the Bedford Whigs. Powell instead views the Bedfords as, along with the Rockingham Whigs, an early example of an organized political party, largely thanks to Rigby's management of Bedford's followers in the Commons, and noting that the Bedfords' position on North America was both consistent and strongly held.

It is propelled through the shallow waters of the delta or the river by standing in the stern and pushing with a pole, in the same manner as punting. Mekoro are traditionally made by digging out the trunk of a large straight tree, such as an ebony tree or Kigelia tree. Modern mekoro, however, are increasingly made of fiberglass, one of the advantages of which is the preservation of more of the large endangered trees. Mokoro safaris are a popular way for tourists to visit the delta and river, much of which is located in national parks, but the boats are still a practical means of transport for local residents to use to move around the swamp. The boats are very vulnerable to attack by hippopotamus, which can overturn them with ease. Hippopotamus are reputed to have developed this behavior after the use of mekoro and other boats for hunting.

Education Watson earned her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1959. While attending the University of Chicago, she studied under Robert Braidwood. Career Watson devoted much of her early career to the archaeological study of the Ancient Near East. Her husband Richard A. Watson convinced her to change her focus from Near Eastern archaeology to work in North America. Watson is a proponent of processual archaeology and has contributed greatly to that approach. In addition, Watson has been instrumental in applying ethnography to the archaeological record. In the 1960s in Mammoth Cave, she introduced the practice of performing recreations of ancient lifeways as a method of filling in gaps from incomplete archaeological data. \\"She has contributed centrally to techniques for recovering carbonized plant remains from archaeological deposits and to understanding the independent origin of pre-maize agriculture in pre-Columbian eastern North America.\\" Her work on the diet of Native Americans who lived in Mammoth Cave has included examining the intestines of bodies found in the cave and has been notably interdisciplinary in scope. Accolades In 1988, Watson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In its November 2002 issue, Discover included Watson among \\"The 50 Most Important Women in Science.\\" The article credited Watson with \\"establishing the best qualitative and quantitative data for an early agricultural complex in North America\\" and with helping to \\"introduce the scientific method into archaeological studies.\\" Watson received the Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement in 1999, and the Pomerance Award for Scientific Contributions to Archaeology in 2007 from the Archaeological Institute of America..
