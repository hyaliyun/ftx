It was events like this which eventually led to the tournament's cancellation in 1984. The tournament itself was an open affair, with an opening victory for England cancelled out by a Scottish win over Northern Ireland and English defeat to Wales. The Welsh stood a good chance of winning the tournament outright for the first time since 1937, but could not beat the Irish in their final match, and ended up in a rare second-place position. The Scots and English thus faced each other in the final match knowing the winner would take the trophy, the Scots achieving a victory on England's home ground to take the trophy for the second year in a row and demonstrate their dominance in British football.

Career Early in his professional career, he played the accordion in a band called \\"Paukova mre≈æa\\" before landing a solo recording deal with the label PGP-RTB (later called PGP-RTS). The band played throughout the then-existing Yugoslavia in places such as restaurants, hotels and discoth√®ques. His first solo album, Ulica jorgovana (1991), was recorded in Belgrade, Serbia and his second album, Poletimo poletimo (1994), was recorded in Munich, Germany. The recording of his third album, Alipa≈°in izvor (1999), started in 1995 in Ljubljana, Slovenia but recording was put on hold until 1998. He then recorded a song entitled \\"Bi≈°ƒçanka\\" and premiered it at a popular music festival in Bihaƒá, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kalaƒç has recorded duets with Serbian singer Stoja (a 2003 remake of his 2000 song \\"Tika tak\\") and Bosnian singer ≈†emsa Suljakoviƒá (\\"La≈æu te\\"; first featured on her 2000 album Ne vjerujem nikom vi≈°e, later re-released on his 2003 album Voda, vazduh i sloboda). Both duets were major successes. Kalaƒç also recorded a song with the Serbian singer Jana called \\"Sunce sjalo\\" for her album Malo magije (2005). He was the inspiration for a cattle character in the 2007 Serbian adult animated comedy film Jet Set. Personal life Kalaƒç lives in Offenbach, Germany and possesses Croatian and Serbian passports. His brother, Caki Kalaƒç, is also a singer. He is a very distant relative of singer and reality star Muhedin \\"ƒåupo\\" Kalaƒç. Sejo himself was offered to participate in Serbian reality shows Parovi (Couples) and Veliki brat (local production of Big Brother), but he rejected both opportunities, saying he did not want to participate in such a circus.

Born at Seymour, Victoria in 1896, Buggy attended school there before moving to Melbourne with his mother after the death of his father. He commenced his journalism career at the South Melbourne Record, and joined the Melbourne Argus in 1917. He studied for the diploma of journalism at the university in 1921. He was gifted with a photographic memory.John Silvester, Hugh Buggy, Melbourne Press Club  Journalist  Although he was deputy news editor of the Sydney Sun for five years, Buggy preferred the role of reporter. He was closely involved in reporting many of the dramatic events of his time such as the fatal shoot-out between Squizzy Taylor and 'Snowy' Cutmore in 1927 and the arrival in Brisbane of Kingsford-Smith and the Southern Cross in 1928. In 1932, following the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, he was the only reporter to gain an interview with Captain Francis de Groot. Buggy was much travelled during his journalism career, working for several Sydney and Melbourne based newspapers. Leaving the Argus during 1923, Buggy worked for the new Melbourne Evening Sun in 1923‚Äì25, then moved to the Sydney Sun in 1925‚Äì27, 1928‚Äì31 and 1937‚Äì42, The Sun News-Pictorial in 1927 and the Melbourne Herald in 1932‚Äì37. In 1950 he rejoined the Argus, and became its chief football-writer in 1951. After the Argus ceased publication in 1957, he worked for various Melbourne suburban newspapers and contributed to the Catholic newspaper, the Advocate, and as chief court reporter for The Truth for three years.  Censor  During World War II he was chief operational censor at General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in 1942‚Äì46. From 1946 to 1950 he was an editor with Radio Australia.  Author  He ghost wrote for Kingsford-Smith and C. T. P. Ulm the Story of the Southern Cross Trans-Pacific Flight in 1928, and for Joe Maxwell V.C., M.C. & Bar, D.C.M the World War I recounting of his experiences Hells Bells and Mademoiselles in 1932, then in 1946 he wrote Pacific Victory. In 1977 his book The Real John Wren was published.  Sport journalism  Buggy was also a highly respected writer on sport, particularly Australian rules football, although he covered a variety of sports. He had a flair for the picturesque sporting phrase: he was widely believed to have coined the term 'bodyline' during the 1932/33 Ashes Test cricket series, but this claim was never settled conclusively. He became chief football-writer at the Argus in 1951 until it ceased publication in 1957.  Death  Buggy married twice, but both marriages ended in divorce and were childless. He died following a heart seizure on 18 June 1974 and was buried in Seymour.  Hall of Fame  Buggy was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, with his citation reading: :Joined The Argus newspaper in 1917 and became a highly respected football writer. Became its chief football writer in 1951, after gaining wider experience elsewhere. Worked for suburban newspapers and continued to write football for the Advocate.

He currently plays flanker and number eight for Stade Toulousain in the Top 14. In 2004, he was named IRB International Under-21 player of the year. In 2011, he was named the New Zealand Rugby player of the year, finishing ahead of Richie McCaw and Ma'a Nonu in the voting. He is a key member of 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cup winning teams, becoming one of only 20 players to have won multiple Rugby World Cups. Kaino is considered by many to be one of the game's greats. Kaino is the second U.S. national of Samoan descent to play for the All Blacks. The first was Frank Solomon in 1931. Early life Kaino was born on 6 April 1983 at Lyndon B. Johnson Medical Center in Faga'alu, located in the U.S. territory of American Samoa as the third of six children. In 1987 at the age of 4, he and his family relocated from their home village of Leone, Tutuila, to Papakura, Auckland. After settling in Papakura, he played junior rugby league for the Papakura Sea Eagles before switching to rugby union in secondary school at Papakura High School and Saint Kentigern College where he was offered a rugby scholarship. He attended both schools with former All Black John Afoa. If Kaino had not come to New Zealand following the lead of his uncle, his relatives assumed that he would have enlisted in the United States Army. Auckland and Blues career Kaino made his Auckland debut in 2004 and his Blues debut in 2006. Prior to being signed for the Blues, Kaino came off the bench in Auckland's 13-17 loss to the British and Irish Lions on 5 July 2005. In 2012 it was announced that Kaino would be leaving the Blues for Japanese club Toyota Verblitz on a two-year deal, following the conclusion of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. On 4 October 2013, Kaino announced he had re- signed with New Zealand Rugby Union, North Harbour and Auckland Blues on a two-year contract. He was expected to return to New Zealand in February in time for the beginning of the 2014 Super Rugby season. Kaino made successful return to the Blues in the 2014 season, being named as the team's captain for the 2015 Super Rugby season, taking over from fellow back-rower Luke Braid. Kaino played his 100th match for the Blues on 28 February 2015, but the Blues unfortunately lost 24-25 to the Cheetahs that day. Kaino's captaincy at the Blues did not last long, with hooker James Parsons taking over during the 2016 Super Rugby season. On 8 September 2017, Kaino played for Auckland for the first time since 2010. Kaino started at number 8 as Auckland lost 38-49 to Taranaki. Toulouse On 17 February 2018, rumours were released that Kaino would potentially move to France at the conclusion of the 2018 Super Rugby season. A week later, Kaino confirmed he would leave New Zealand. Stade Toulousain, based in Toulouse, France subsequently announced that Kaino would join their team, containing Kaino's former All Blacks and Blues teammate Charlie Faumuina. International career =Early career= Despite being without a Super Rugby contract for the 2005 Super 12 season, Kaino was called into the All Blacks on 2004's end-of-season tour. Kaino made his All Blacks debut on 4 December 2004 when he started at blindside flanker against the Barbarians in an uncapped fixture at Twickenham Stadium in London. Kaino played the full 80 minutes and scored a try on debut, with the All Blacks winning 47-19. Kaino played his first two tests against Ireland in 2006. He did not play for New Zealand again until 2008, missing the 2007 Rugby World Cup due to injury. In 2008 Kaino, who earned many comparisons with Jerry Collins for his uncompromising physical style, would become a key member of the All Blacks setup. Kaino's return from injury saw him become the national side's first-choice blindside flanker. In 2011 Kaino played an important role in the All Blacks winning the Rugby World Cup. He was named in the starting XV for every game. He played every minute of every game except for the final few seconds in the semi-final against Australia. He scored four tries in the World Cup. =2014-2015= Kaino returned to the All Blacks from his stint in Japan and during the 2014 three-test series against England, temporarily replaced incumbent number eight Kieran Read, who was being forced to sit out after suffering a relapse of concussion symptoms. Kaino started at number 8 for the first two tests of the series, the second of which on 14 July 2014, was his 50th test for the All Blacks. Kaino celebrated his milestone with a narrow 28-27 victory for the All Blacks. Kaino returned to blindside flanker in the third test if the series following Read's recovery, pushing Liam Messam out of his starting place. Kaino finished off his 2014 season in which he made eight appearances for the All Blacks by scoring his only try of the year, allowing the All Blacks to comfortably beat Wales 34-16 on 22 November 2014. Kaino was selected for the 2015 Rugby World Cup as part of New Zealand's 31-man All Blacks squad. Kaino achieved many career milestones in the competition, playing in all seven All Black tests in the competition. His most notable performances in the competition were in the quarter-final on 17 October 2015 where the All Blacks beat France 62-13 and in the semi-final's 20-18 win against South Africa on 24 October 2015. He scored tries in both of those knockout rounds, but was also yellow-carded for being offside against South Africa in the 39th minute of the semi-final. Kaino, alongside teammates Sam Whitelock and Sonny Bill Williams played in their record 14th consecutive World Cup wins when New Zealand beat Australia 34-17 on 31 October 2015, to win their third Rugby World Cup. Kaino was replaced by Hurricanes forward Victor Vito with nine minutes left of the World Cup final. =2016-2018= Kaino struggled with injury throughout 2016, but still managed to play for New Zealand in 12 All Blacks tests. Kaino scored his final international try for New Zealand on 20 August 2016 as the All Blacks beat the Wallabies by 42-8. This season most notably included the 40-29 defeat to Ireland in Chicago where Kaino was featured out of position as lock, due to injury previously received by Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock against Australia. Kaino struggled to perform well in the unfamiliar role against Ireland and was replaced by test debutant Scott Barrett in the 45th minute. Kaino recovered from a knee injury to be selected as a member of the All Blacks' 33-man squad for the 2017 Pasifika Challenge and three-test series against the touring British and Irish Lions team. Becoming one of few players to play against the Lions in multiple tours, Kaino took part in the first test of the 2017 series on 24 June 2017 by starting at 6 for his home crowd at Eden Park. Kaino was subbed off in the 45th minute, being replaced by Ardie Savea as the All Blacks went on to win 30-15. Kaino was unfortunately subbed off less than 30 minutes into the second test of the Lions series due to the red-carding of Blues teammate Sonny Bill Williams. Kaino was replaced by debutant Ngani Laumape so that the All Blacks were not a back short at set-piece. Kaino was also yellow-carded in the third test's 49th minute for a swinging forearm on Lions lock Alun Wyn Jones, who had to be replaced by Courtney Lawes as he copped a blow from Kaino's arm. The series was disappointing for Kaino and for the All Blacks who allowed the Lions to break multiple records as the series was drawn 1-1. Following the drawn Lions series, Kaino was selected for the 2017 Rugby Championship but did not play in the competition due to personal reasons, making his first ITM Cup appearance for Auckland in 7 years. Kaino's absence from the Rugby Championship saw him lose his starting spot to Liam Squire and Vaea Fifita who spent the 2017 putting forward cases to make the number 6 jersey theirs. Kaino started at number 8 in the All Blacks' 31-22 win over the Barbarians on the end-of-year tour but was subbed off with a posterior cruciate ligament injury in the 45th minute and replaced by Sam Cane. Kaino announced his signing to Toulouse in 2018, effectively retiring from international rugby.

Both Gibsons have solid spruce tops and engraved pickguards. The Dove has solid maple back and sides instead of the solid mahogany used for the Hummingbird, and a longer scale length (25.5\\" vs 24.75\\"). These make it a louder, brighter guitar than the Hummingbird. The double parallelogram fingerboard inlays, the two doves on the bridge, and the dove on the pickguard are mother-of-pearl. The original Doves had Gibson's metal tune-o-matic bridge, which seemed like a technological improvement at the time but had negative effects on tone and volume. The Dove has factory installed LR Baggs active electronics powered by a 9-volt battery. In 1968 the internal bracing of the Dove was made heavier. This sturdier guitar was less likely to be returned to Gibson for warranty work, but its volume was reduced and tone negatively affected.Eldon Whitford, David Vinopal, Dan Erlewine.; Gibson's fabulous flat-top guitars : an illustrated history & guide; GPI Books; San Francisco; c1994.

Function  LRPAP1 is involved with trafficking of certain members of the LDL receptor family including LRP1 and LRP2. It is a glycoprotein that binds to the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor, as well as to other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. It acts to inhibit the binding of all known ligands for these receptors, and may prevent receptor aggregation and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby acting as a molecular chaperone. It may be under the regulatory control of calmodulin, since it is able to bind calmodulin and be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent kinase II.  Interactions  LDL-receptor-related protein-associated protein has been shown to interact with LRP2. Mutations and diseases related to LRPAP1 Lipid metabolizing proteins may elevate susceptibility to dementia leading to differences in genetic makeup. PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism technique is used for genotyping of LRPAP1 intron 5 insertion/deletion. The studies suggested that DD genotype and *D allele of LRPAP gene showed increased frequency for degenerative dementias on comparison with the control group and that LRPAP1-D allele remarkably increases the vulnerability to degenerative dementias. On genotyping of LRPAP1 polymorphism is observed because of 37 base pair insertion in intron 5. Also insertion allele being larger than deletion allele makes possible in detecting difference by gel electrophoresis. Suppression of receptor-binding domain of LRP LDLR is due to overexpression of LRPAP (the protein product of LRPAP gene). LRP gives protection across LDL by LRPAP and its downregulation may be subjected for an elevation of LDL and Ab-related neuronal toxicity as LRP supports in binding of ligand and internalization of LRP ligands like apo-E- enriched LDL cholesterol and Ab protein. Insertion/deletion is an intronic polymorphism of LRPAP gene, Influencing DD genotype and D allele for the synthesis of LRPAP protein can be lrp-mediated mechanism contributing to dementia. Concern for developing sensitivity for dementia is because of several shared common genetic platforms and DD genotype or D allele of LRPAP gene may be one such. So on 37-bp insertion/deletion that was studied as an intronic polymorphism, it could be having an unintended pursuit for lipid receptor protein by regulation of LRPAP expression, or it could be in linkage disequilibrium in addition to other biologically relevant polymorphism in the LRPAP1 or an adjacent gene in chromosome 4. Results being consistent with earlier study where the authors have endowed deletion allele frequency clearly high in late-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs disease patients on comparison with non- demented aged controls. Mendelian forms of myopia has been identified in four consanguineous families and are the likely causal mutations implementing exome /autozygome investigated to recognize homozygous truncating variants in LRPAP1. Influencing TGF-Œ≤ activity,chaperone of LRP1 is encoded by LRPAP1.Notably salient deficiency of LRP1 and upregulation of TGF-Œ≤ in affected individuals cells, the known data being consistent on the importance of TGF-Œ≤ in remodeling for the sclera of myopia and the increased frequency in individuals for myopia having Marfan syndrome which has characteristics of upregulated TGF-Œ≤ signaling. Analysizing the absence of the normal protein was done with immunoblot for affected individuals having LRPAP1 mutations revealing the mutations in LRPAP1 probability of loss-of-function mutations. Encoding (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein Associated protein 1) LRPAP is a largely expressed gene, and a 357 amino acid protein thought as a chaperone binding and protecting the lipoproteins receptor-related proteins LRP1 and LRP2. A model suggested by a study wherein LRPAP1 leading to deficiency of LRP1 which was responsible to perturbation of TGF-Œ≤ regulation and might cause abnormal ECM remodeling in the eye development. On observation for increasing axial length was one of the salient features of Marfan syndrome also resulting in TGF-Œ≤ supported the model. Therefore, individuals having myopia responding to therapeutic strategy initiated before ECM remodeling could be considered as an approach for individuals with LRPAP1 related myopia.

In bacteriology, a fimbria (Latin for 'fringe', plural fimbriae), also referred to as an \\"attachment pilus\\" by some scientists, is a type of appendage that is found on many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, and that is thinner and shorter than a flagellum. This appendage ranges from 3‚Äì10 nanometers in diameter and can be as much as several micrometers long. Fimbriae are used by bacteria to adhere to one another and to adhere to animal cells and some inanimate objects. A bacterium can have as many as 1,000 fimbriae. Fimbriae are only visible with the use of an electron microscope. They may be straight or flexible. Fimbriae possess adhesins which attach them to some sort of substratum so that the bacteria can withstand shear forces and obtain nutrients. For example, E. coli uses them to attach to mannose receptors. Some aerobic bacteria form a very thin layer at the surface of a broth culture. This layer, called a pellicle, consists of many aerobic bacteria that adhere to the surface by their fimbriae. Thus, fimbriae allow the aerobic bacteria to remain both on the broth, from which they take nutrients, and near the air. \\"Gram-negative bacteria assemble functional amyloid surface fibers called curli.\\" Curli are a type of fimbriae; another type are called type I fimbriae. Curli are composed of proteins called curlins. Some of the genes involved are CsgA, CsgB, CsgC, CsgD, CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG. thumbThis figure depicts fimbriae adhesion. In this process the fimbriae of a bacterial cell (right) adhere to specific proteins, called receptors, found on the outer membrane of a host cell (left). They do this by a specific interaction between the receptors of the host cell and the perfectly matched adhesions found on the bacteria‚Äôs fimbriae. This process of bacteria adhering to a host cell can result in the colonization of that host cell as more and more bacteria collect around it, and is integral to the continued survival of the bacteria, enabling them to infect tissues and entire organs. Virulence Fimbriae are one of the primary mechanisms of virulence for E. coli, Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. Their presence greatly enhances the bacteria's ability to attach to the host and cause disease.

In addition to a football side, TSG has departments for gymnastics and dance, table tennis, athletics, volleyball, and hiking. The team has its origins in the gymnastics club Turnverein W√∂rsdorf established on 8 July 1887. A football department was formed in 1921 and became independent within a year as Sportverein 1922 W√∂rsdorf. The association all but disappeared after the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933 as it was assimilated by a larger community sports organization established by the regime. An independent club was re- established in 1945 and was soon reunited with its parent side with the club playing as SV. By 1950 the club was known briefly as Turn- und Sportgemeinschaft W√∂rsdorf/Taunus before adopting its current name. The development of a new sports facility in 1980 helped to motivate a drive to improve the football team. Playing in the local Kreisliga in the late 80s the footballers began a steady ascent that took them to the Landesliga Hessen- Mitte (V) in 1993 and then on into the Oberliga Hessen (IV) in 2001. The club's best results were consecutive 7th-place finishes earned in 2005 and 2006. After nine seasons in the Hessenliga, the club was relegated to the Verbandsliga in 2010 and to the Gruppenliga Wiesbaden after another relegation in 2012. A league championship there in 2015 took the club back up to the Verbandsliga, from which it was relegated again in 2019.

It is the successor to NCAA Football 07 in the NCAA Football series. It was officially announced with the launch of the NCAA 08 page on the EA Sports website on February 20, 2007.NCAA 08 is officially announced EA Sports had opened up a ballot on their NCAA Football 07 site in which fans can vote on a feature to be implemented into the PlayStation 2 version, making it the first console announced for the game and announcing at least one of its features.Fans vote on PS2 feature for NCAA 08 Fans could vote for either in-game saves, medical red shirts, summer workouts or a lead blocker feature. The option of medical red shirts was voted on and won, and this option is on the Dynasty Mode on all versions of NCAA Football 08. This allows for players that are injured in the middle of the year to apply to gain another year of eligibility. The game was released on July 17, 2007, and the first time release on PlayStation 3, marking the eleventh installment of the NCAA Football series bearing the title \\"NCAA Football\\". As with NCAA Football 07, 08 features limited ESPN integration. Next-gen improvements Animations: NCAA Football 08 runs at 60 frames per second on the Xbox 360 (up from 30 in last year's edition). PS3 remains at 30 frames per second but still includes many of the animations present on the 360 albeit at a slower speed. There are 115 detailed stadiums, up from 40 in NCAA Football 07. The game also features a new gameplay engine and branching animation system. This allows for gang tackling, mid-air collisions, sideline catches, and several other brand new animations. Control Scheme: In keeping with the brand new animations, NCAA Football 08 features a fairly new control scheme from NCAA Football 07. The hit stick has been improved allowing for players to take out the ball carrier's legs by pressing down on the right analog stick. Lead blocking controls from Madden have crossed over onto NCAA Football 08. Offensive hot routes, audibles, and defensive playmaker options are also new additions to NCAA Football 08. The difference between All- American and Heisman is comparable to the difference between night and day because one could go undefeated with a team in All-American mode but move up to Heisman and lose every single game. Motivation: Next gen versions include a new motivation system. If a player does well, it will boost his motivation making his attributes better. Eventually, if this player is motivated enough he will also motivate other people which will raise their attributes as well. Recruiting Features: The dynasty mode includes a more in depth recruiting feature allowing the user to make promises and recruiting visits. As in previous games, NCAA Football 08 allows the user to export their rosters to Madden 08. Player Creation: When users create a Campus Legend on Xbox 360 or PS3, a player and high school are created, and the game begins at the state championship playoffs. Performance during the playoffs will determine your caliber. The higher your caliber, the higher your stats will get, and more schools will offer you a scholarship. As in the previous two games, the player will also have the option to walk-on at another school. There are scouts from different schools at every game, so the better you play the bigger the schools that are interested. You even get the option when creating your player to choose your top choice so your coach knows who your primary school focus is on. You will no longer control the whole team, but only your player; This has not been changed for PlayStation 2 or Xbox. Campus Legend on PlayStation 2 and Xbox is relatively unchanged; the user still encounters the five drills as before. Mini Games: There is a new mini game of sorts available for play called Points Pursuit on the current gen versions. It is similar to a regular game except that the scoring is based on yards gained, tackles, interceptions, touchdowns, and other things as well as arcade style gameplay and several random opportunities for double, triple, and quadruple points. Skills: During regular gameplay, the user can look at his or her My Skills. My Skills keeps track of all the user controlled plays a player has made. For example, if you made a \\"user pick\\" with CB #1, then in the My Skills menu it will read CB #1 1 INT. My Skills is only available in the current gen versions. Highlights: A new feature for the series are My Highlights, which users can use to save game replays and snap shots from previously played games and subsequently upload to EA Sports World GDC 2008 Coverage: Wrapping it Up. My Highlights are exclusive to next gen versions of the game. Award Tracking: My Shrine is another new addition which allows users to keep track of their trophies and accomplishments. Trick Plays: Inspired by the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, NCAA Football also introduces more trick plays than before. The hook and ladder (the name of the play on the cover, but dubbed the \\"circus\\" by Boise State) and statue of liberty play are both playable on this game in addition to a multitude of other trick plays including a flea flicker and halfback pass. Cover athlete On March 2, 2007, it was announced by EA Sports that Jared Zabransky was chosen as the cover athlete for the upcoming NCAA Football 08. The main reason cited for this decision was Zabransky's outstanding year with the Boise State Broncos and their win in the BCS Fiesta Bowl over Oklahoma as the second at-large team from a non-Bowl Championship Series conference. He is the second cover athlete in the NCAA Football series that went undrafted the next year, along with Nebraska QB Tommie Frazier. Demo A week before the game's release, EA Sports released an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3 demo for NCAA Football 08 on the Xbox Live Marketplace. It features a playable contest of the top two teams in the game - the USC Trojans and the Michigan Wolverines - in the Los Angeles Coliseum with two minute quarters.

The name Mnjikaning, or fully vocalized as Minjikaning, refers to the fishing weirs at Atherley Narrows between Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching and it means \\"in/on/at or near the fence\\". Rama is one of the Williams Treaties First Nations which consists of Rama, Beausoleil, Georgina Island, Scugog Island, Curve Lake, Hiawatha and Alderville, Together these Nations have a large Treaty area comprising Treaty 18, 16, 5, 20, 27, 27 1/4, Crawford Purchase and the Gunshot Treaty. Rama sits on approximately of land on eight separate parcels. It was once known as Mnjikaning and Rama Mnjikaning but after a community referendum has since re-assumed the name of Chippewas of Rama First Nation. There are 1600 members with approximately 700 living on the reserve and about 900 living off the reserve. The First Nation is adjacent to a 4,500-year-old wooden stake fishing weir system which at one time sustained many Native peoples but, it is not clear who actually built this structure. The First Nation's main reserve, the Mnjikaning First Nation 32 Indian Reserve, is located approximately northeast of Orillia, Ontario. Rama First Nation is geographically located within the Township of Ramara, but functions separately. Rama First Nation is also home to Casino Rama and Entertainment Complex. The people are descendants of the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe (1800s) and were part of the Coldwater (1836) experiment before settling on the eastern shores of Lake Couchiching. While the ancestors used clan markings/drawings for signatures, original family names were replaced with English names. Many of the families currently living on and off the reserve include these original family names such as Benson, Ingersoll, Williams, Douglas, Shilling, Simcoe, Snache, St. Germain, Stinson, Yellowhead, Sandy, Sawyer, Anderson and York. Some later name additions (mainly due to marriage) include Comego, Cottrell, Cote, Desormeaux, Genno, Noganosh, Muir, Stiles, Watson, Graham, McPhee, McRae and others. History/Origins Arriving to the area during the Great Anishinaabe migration, the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe briefly migrated north during conflict with the Haudenosaunee during the Beaver Wars. Following resolution of the Beaver Wars and the creation of the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt, the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe returned to Mnjikaning.Williams, Doug, ‚ÄúMichi Saagiig Nishnaabeg: This Is Our Territory‚Äù, (2018) The Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe occupied, at their greatest known extent, the lands surrounding Lake Simcoe and the Holland River watershed, extending westwards to encompass roughly present-day Simcoe County. Over a twenty-year span beginning in 1798, their leaders ceded the country west of the lake to the government of Upper Canada via three separate purchase agreements‚Äîthe Penetanguishene Bay Purchase (1798), the Lake Simcoe‚ÄìLake Huron Purchase (1815) and the South Simcoe Purchase (1818). In 1828 the Chippewas numbered approximately \\"550 souls\\" under the leadership of \\"Chief Yellow Head\\"‚Äîthe same \\"Musquakie or Yellow Head, Chief of the Rein Deer Tribe\\", who was involved in the Lake Simcoe-Lake Huron Purchase and the South Simcoe Purchase. They still occupied their remaining lands about Lake Simcoe and the Holland River, and reportedly had \\"expressed a strong desire to be admitted to Christianity, and to adopt the habits of civilized life\\".Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 104 In 1830, Musquakie/Yellowhead and his people were induced by agents of Lieutenant Governor John Colborne to settle in two purpose-built villages, one at the Atherley Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and Couchiching, and the other at Coldwater, between which they cleared a road on his instructions. Colborne began paying the Chippewas an annuity and identified \\"three islands set apart for them\\", but it was his hope that they would soon take to farming, the village of Orillia having been established by white settlers brought there to teach them European farming techniques.Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 107 In a surviving letter to Colborne dated September 1830, Yellowhead and four other leaders spoke of their gladness at receiving \\"the money you sent us\\" for clearing the road, asking however \\"when you can pay us the remainder\\".Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 105-6 Just six years later, Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head persuaded the Chippewas to give up this country \\"[rather] than to continue [living] on it, surrounded as it was by the White Population, and consequently deprived as it was of its Game\\".Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 112 Musquakie/Yellowhead and his chiefs afterwards objected to this Simcoe-Coldwater Purchase, writing to Governor General Charles Bagot in 1842 that \\"we were not made sensible of the full purport\\" of the deal, which paid them only one-third of the proceeds of the sale, and complaining that \\"we have not received any money from the sale of the said Land\\".Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 115-16 Bond Head had hidden from the Chippewas his intention to sell the land, lot by lot, to white settlers and to forward the proceeds to them as they were generated. Their petition of 1842 received a sympathetic hearing: as they had asked, the proceeds of the piecemeal sales of their former land were banked, and the Chippewas received an annual income from the interest.Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 119 As a consequence of the Simcoe-Coldwater Purchase, the Chippewas had to abandon the villages built for them by Colborne in 1830. The Coldwater band relocated to Beausoleil Island in Georgian Bay, whereas, in 1838, the main band at the Atherley Narrows relocated to Rama, where they had obtained 1600 acres of land \\"purchased out of their own funds\\" at a cost of $3200.Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 120 The population of the new settlement was calculated in 1858 to be 201 persons, and its inhabitants' annual revenue from land purchases was $1894.21.Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 120 Notwithstanding this income, a government report of 1858 commented on the \\"lamentable\\" conditions of life among the Chippewas of Rama, observing that, owing to government neglect, \\"the log houses built for them ... being badly constructed, are all going to decay\\", that farming was not being taken up, and that the residents \\"are dragging through a life disgraceful to humanity\\".Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 120 Indebtedness to white traders accounts for some of the settlement's early economic woes. In 1839, Musquakie/Yellowhead and two of his chiefs wrote to the Indian Department, that, as soon as Rama was up and running, they intended \\"to go and hunt in order to pay our debts to those we have been so long owing\\".Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 114-15 Musquakie/Yellowhead, also known as William Yellowhead, died on 11 January 1864. In his will, which the government declared invalid, he appointed his nephew Isaac Yellowhead to succeed him as \\"Head Chief of the Chippewa tribe of Indians\\", but it was Joseph B. Naingishkung who succeeded him.Murray (ed.), Muskoka and Haliburton, 130-31 Governance The First Nation's leadership consists of a chief and six councillors, elected under the Indian Act Electoral System put into place in the 1930s by Canada in the attempt to depose hereditary chiefs and headman as leaders. The current elected leadership (2014-2016) is Chief Rodney Noganosh and Councillors Ronald Douglas, Ted Williams, Tracey Snache, Nemke Quarrington, and Gina Genno. A by-election held in January 2015 elected a sixth councillor, Ted Snache. The First Nation is a member of Ogemawahj Tribal Council, a regional Chiefs' council, and in June 2016 rejoined the Union of Ontario Indians/Anishinabek Nation. Rama is also a part of the Chippewa Tri- Council which consists of Beausoleil First Nation and the Chippewas of Georgina Island as well as descendants in Neywash (Huron-Robinson Treaty). The Chippewa Tri-Council were once one reserve, the Coldwater Narrows Reserve established in 1830, under one principal chief, Chief Yellowhead. Further, before The Coldwater Narrows Reserve was established this group was the Chippewas of Lake Simcoe and Huron.

It was released in 1995 by Earache Records on 12\\" vinyl and CD. The single's two remixes were also included on the Selfless/Merciless compilation released on Earache Records in 1996. Music and critical reception Regarding the song \\"Crush My Soul\\", Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick said: Richard Fontenoy, a contributor to Rough Guide to Rock, stated in the book that \\"Godflesh's breakthrough into metal acceptance has a tendency towards mechanical, headbanging sameness, though the excellent 'Crush My Soul' is based around an asthmatically weaving sample loop.\\" Ned Raggett of AllMusic wrote, \\"Songs like 'Anything Is Mine' and 'Crush My Soul', the latter infused with a strange breathing rhythm loop, or so it sounds, capture this version of major-label Godflesh pretty well, both unpleasant enough to keep the wimps away and accessible enough to win over the more open-minded.\\" Ira A. Robbins of Trouser Press wrote, \\"the screaming 'Crush My Soul' demonstrate[s] an incipient sense of melody\\". Writing for Billboard, Larry Flick praised the single, saying, \\"Many may misread the passionate plea as angst, but buried deep beneath the cold, isolationist shell is a core with purely positive intentions. Dig for it.\\" On the \\"Ultramix\\" version of the song, The Wire wrote, \\"Even the rather ponderous industrial menace of Godflesh is transformed in their 'Ultramix' of 'Crush My Soul', although...it's too long.\\" Music video Originally, Broadrick wanted to recruit Swiss artist H. R. Giger to direct \\"Crush My Soul's\\" music video, but he proved too expensive. The video was ultimately directed by photographer Andres Serrano, who was known for his controversial 1987 photograph Piss Christ. The video, which was Serrano's debut music video, featured the band performing in the Angel Orensanz Synagogue interspersed with clips of cockfighting and religious iconography. Performance artist Bob Flanagan was also featured in the video, portraying an upside down Christ figure hoisted up on a ceiling. The video cost $75,000 to create. =Controversy= In an interview with SHOOT magazine, Serrano said, \\"I never set out to start any kind of controversy and I'm not foreseeing any kind of controversy with this video‚Äïit's not like we are out to prove anything.\\" Regardless, the video drew media attention for its transgressive content. It was subsequently rejected from being aired by MTV, whose acquisitions group felt that \\"musically there wasn't a home for it at the current time.\\" As a result of the rejection, Earache and Columbia Records changed their strategies into distributing the clip to regional video shows and to The Box, which aired content that MTV found objectionable. Broadrick believed the video's lack of airplay was in part responsible for Columbia abruptly dropping Godflesh. =Influence on Metallica= Godflesh showed the video for \\"Crush My Soul\\" to Metallica's Kirk Hammett. According to Broadrick, Hammett loved the video. Metallica later used art by Serrano for the cover of their 1996 album Load. Broadrick, disappointed by not being credited for discovering the artist, said this was no coincidence, and that no one in Metallica knew about Serrano before the \\"Crush My Soul\\" video. Later, Hammett praised Godflesh, calling them the heaviest band in the world and citing them as his favorite band. Track listing All songs written by Justin Broadrick and G.C. Green.

It is most closely associated with modernism, but it predates it.http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Overview According to Clement Greenberg, who helped popularize the term, medium specificity holds that \\"the unique and proper area of competence\\" for a form of art corresponds with the ability of an artist to manipulate those features that are \\"unique to the nature\\" of a particular medium. For example, in painting, literal flatness and abstraction are emphasised rather than illusionism and figuration.Vanessa R. Schwartz, Jeannene M. Przyblyski, The Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture Reader, Routledge, 2004, p8. Medium specific can be seen to mean that \\"the artwork is constituted by the characteristic qualities of the raw material.\\" This would probably include the techniques used to manipulate the materials. \\"Medium-specificity is based on the distinct materiality of artistic media.\\" As early as 1776 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing \\"contends that an artwork, in order to be successful, needs to adhere to the specific stylistic properties of its own medium.\\"http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Today, the term is used both to describe artistic practices and as a way to analyze artwork. Critic N. Katherine Hayles, for example, speaks of \\"media specific analysis.\\" As discussed by critic Marshall Soules, medium specificity and media specific analysis are playing an important role in the emergence of new media art forms, such as Internet art. Medium specificity suggests that a work of art can be said to be successful if it fulfills the promise contained in the medium used to bring the artwork into existence. Much debate can remain as to what a given medium best lends itself to. Art dialogue in the post-modern period has tended to steer away from medium specificity as a particularly relevant principle.http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Medium Specificity  See also  *Classificatory disputes about art *Form follows function *\\"Ornament and Crime\\" *Truth to materials *Painterliness References External links * Medium Specificity * University of Chicago: Theories of Media: Glossary: medium specificity Concepts in aesthetics Modern art ","title":"Medium specificity"},{"id":"9704120","text":"Yang Xuangan (Ê•äÁéÑÊÑü Y√°ng Xu√°ng«én) (died 613) was an official of the Chinese dynasty Sui Dynasty. He was the son of the powerful official Yang Su, and, as he knew that Emperor Yang was apprehensive of his father, was never quite secure. In 613, when Emperor Yang was attacking Goguryeo, he rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang, but was soon defeated. He ordered his brother Yang Jishan (Ê•äÁ©çÂñÑ) to kill him, as to not fall into Emperor Yang's hands. Background It is not known when Yang Xuangan was born. He was the oldest son of Yang Su, who was already a major general at the start of Sui Dynasty in 581 but whose honors and power grew as the years went by. Yang Xuangan was considered by some to be developmentally disabled while in his childhood, but his father believed that not to be the case, and as he grew, he was studious and known for his strength and martial skills, he was particularly skillful at mounted archery, as well as the use of spears. In the Book of Sui, Yang Xuangan was described as a courageous and stalwart man with a shiny and thick beard. Because of his father's accomplishments, Yang Xuangan was repeatedly honored by Sui's founder Emperor Wen as well. In 589, after his father's contributions in the conquest of Chen Dynasty, which allowed Sui to unite China, Yang Xuangan was given the honorific office of Yitong Sansi (ÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏, fifth rank, first division, in Sui's system of nine ranks with two divisions each). Unlike several of his brothers, Yang Xuangan was not created a ducal title, as he was his father's heir apparent and expected to eventually inherit his father's title. In 602, after Yang Su's victory over Tujue, Yang Xuangan was promoted to Zhuguo (Êü±Âúã, second rank, first division) -- the same rank that his father was at, and at imperial gatherings, father and son stood in the same area. Soon thereafter, Emperor Wen demoted Yang Xuangan down to third rank, and Yang Xuangan thanked Emperor Wen appropriately, \\"I did not know that Your Imperial Majesty would give me this much favor -- so that I can show respect to my father in public as much as I do in private.\\" Map showing major uprisings and rebellions in the last years of Sui dynasty. During Emperor Wen's reign, Yang Xuangan served as the governor of Ying Province (ÈÉ¢Â∑û, roughly modern Wuhan, Hubei), and was said to be an effective monitor of his subordinate officials, finding out both their good deeds and evil deeds and rewarding or punishing them appropriately. He later served as the governor of Song Province (ÂÆãÂ∑û, roughly modern Shangqiu, Henan), but while still at that position, his father Yang Su died in 604. He inherited his father's highly honored title of Duke of Chu, and he left governmental service to observe a mourning period. After about a year, he became a minister in the government of Emperor Wen's successor Emperor Yang. He was said to be arrogant but a patron of literary talents, and many talented people became his guests. He particularly trusted Li Mi, also from a noble house. While Yang Su was alive, Emperor Yang had been deeply apprehensive of Yang Su's power and angry with Yang Su's arrogance, and after Yang Su's death, he made the comment, \\"If Yang Su did not die, his clan would have eventually been exterminated.\\" Yang Xuangan heard rumors of this comment, and was apprehensive of Emperor Yang. As he saw how the imperial governance had deteriorated under Emperor Yang and believed how many officials who were prior subordinates of his father Yang Su would support him, he plotted to depose Emperor Yang and declaring Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor. As he followed Emperor Yang on a campaign against Tuyuhun in 609, he saw how disorganized the Emperor's train was and considered an ambush at that point, but his uncle Yang Shen (Ê•äÊÖé) dissuaded him from the action. Later, during Emperor Yang's preparation for war against Goguryeo, Yang Xuangan volunteered to serve, and his volunteering greatly pleased Emperor Yang, who trusted him more and more and gave him input in important governmental matters. Rebellion In 613, as Emperor Yang was launching his second campaign against Goguryeo, he put Yang Xuangan in charge of ensuring food supplies at the important shipping junction of Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ, in modern Hebi, Henan). Yang Xuangan withheld the food supply ships, and then, in summer 613, occupied Liyang and declared an uprising, initially declaring that the general Lai Hu'er (‰æÜË≠∑ÂÖí) had revolted and that he was attacking Lai, but soon also declaring that he was restoring the laws of the time of Emperor Wen, signifying a repudiation of Emperor Yang. He soon publicly denounced Emperor Yang of misrule and tyranny, and immediately drew popular support in the region as well as the strongest shipping laborers and sailors. He summoned Li Mi and his brother Yang Xuanting (Ê•äÁéÑÊå∫) from the capital Chang'an, and his brothers Yang Xuanzong (Ê•äÁéÑÁ∏±) and Yang Wandan (Ê•äËê¨Áü≥) from the Goguryeo front, but Yang Wandan was captured and executed. Yang Xuangan made Li Mi his chief strategist, and Li Mi gave him three options, in the order of Li's opinion as to their feasibility: #Li's \\"high strategy\\" involved making a surprise attack on Jicheng (modern Beijing) and Linyu (Ëá®Ê¶Ü, in modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei), capturing those key locations to trap Emperor Yang, who then was on the Goguryeo front. Li believed that Goguryeo would then make a crippling attack on Emperor Yang, and that Emperor Yang's forces would either collapse on their own or surrender. #Li's \\"middle strategy\\" involved making a surprise attack on Chang'an and capturing the surrounding Guanzhong region, and then holding the region and preparing for confrontation with Emperor Yang. #Li's \\"low strategy\\" involved making a surprise attack on the eastern capital Luoyang and trying to capture it quickly and hold it as the command center. However, he warned that Tang Hui (ÂîêË§ò), who had initially submitted to Yang Xuangan but who had since fled back to Luoyang, might have already warned the city to firm up its defenses‚Äîand that if Yang Xuangan put Luoyang under siege and could not capture it quickly, he would soon be trapped by converging Sui forces. Yang Xuangan, however, believing that he needed to capture Luoyang to show that his rebellion was serious, commented that Li's \\"low strategy\\" was in fact \\"high strategy,\\" and headed toward Luoyang. However, as Li had predicted, Tang had warned Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong the Prince of Yue and the official Fan Zigai (Ê®äÂ≠êËìã), whom Emperor Yang left in charge of Luoyang, and Luoyang's defenses had been prepared. While Yang Xuangan and his brothers gained some victories, he could not quickly capture Luoyang. Meanwhile, many young noblemen were joining his cause. After he captured the highly regarded official Wei Fusi (ÈüãÁ¶èÂó£), he trusted Wei as well and did not only trust Li any further, but strategies that Wei submitted were not wholeheartedly in support of the rebellion. Li requested that Yang Xuangan kill Wei, but Yang Xuangan refused. Li made the comment to his relatives, \\"The Duke of Chu wanted to rebel, but does not know how to gain final victory. We are now like turtles stuck in urns.\\" At this time, Emperor Yang was sieging Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning), and had nearly captured it from Goguryeo forces when news of Yang Xuangan's rebellion arrived. Yang Xuangan's associate Husi Zheng (ÊñõÊñØÊîø) surrendered to Goguryeo, and Emperor Yang retreated at night. Also around the same time, Wei Wensheng (Ë°õÊñáÊòá), the official Emperor Yang left in charge of Chang'an, came to Luoyang's aid with his troops, and Lai also arrived. Further, the forward forces returning from the Goguryeo front, under the command of Qutu Tong (Â±àÁ™ÅÈÄö) and Yuwen Shu, soon arrived as well, and while Yang Xuangan attempted to prevent them from crossing the Yellow River, attacks from Fan prevented Yang Xuangan from being able to cut Qutu and Yuwen off at the Yellow River, allowing them to cross. Yang Xuangan was soon losing battles, and under the suggestion of Li Zixiong (ÊùéÂ≠êÈõÑ) and Li Mi, he decided to falsely declare that Yuan Hongsi (ÂÖÉÂºòÂó£), the general in command at Honghua (ÂºòÂåñ, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), was joining his cause, and that he was going to meet with Yuan. In fall 613, Yang Xuangan thus lifted the siege on Luoyang, and headed west. On the way, however, he was tempted by the people of Hongnong (ÂºòËæ≤, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), who opined that Hongnong would be easily captured and could be held. Further, the governor of Hongnong Commandery, Emperor Yang's cousin Yang Zhiji (Ê•äÊô∫Á©ç) the Prince of Cai, was intentionally insulting Yang Xuangan to enrage him. In anger, Yang Xuangan put Hongnong under siege, despite Li Mi's pleas that he was endangering his campaign by proceeding slowly. Yang Xuangan put Hongnong under siege for three days but could not capture it, and therefore had to continue to head west. By this point, the Sui forces commanded by Yuwen, Wei, Lai, and Qutu had caught up to him, and were dealing him defeats, and his forces collapsed. Yang Xuangan and his brother Yang Jishan fled to Jialurong (Ëë≠ËòÜÊàé, also in modern Sanmenxia) on foot, and Yang Xuangan, realizing that they were about to be captured and not wanting to be captured, asked Yang Jishan to kill him. Yang Jishan did so, and then tried to commit suicide, but before he could die, he was captured and delivered to Emperor Yang, along with Yang Xuangan's head. Emperor Yang ordered that Yang Xuangan's body be cut into pieces and then ground and burned. All of Yang Xuangan's brothers were executed.

The family was killed by the Bolsheviks on 17 July 1918 at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The house was later demolished. The Church on Blood was built on this site, and the altar stands over the execution site. The family was canonized on 1 November 1981 as new martyrs by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Their servants, who had been killed along with them, were also canonized. The canonized servants were Yevgeny Botkin, court physician; Alexei Trupp, footman; Ivan Kharitonov, cook; and Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid. Also canonized were two servants killed in September 1918, lady in waiting Anastasia Hendrikova and tutor Catherine Adolphovna Schneider. All were canonized as victims of oppression by the Bolsheviks. The Russian Orthodox Church did not canonize the servants, two of whom were not Orthodox Christians: Trupp was Roman Catholic, and Schneider was Lutheran. Alexandra's sister, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was murdered by the Bolsheviks on 18 July 1918, was canonized on 1 November 1981 as New-Martyr Elizabeth by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, along with Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Igor Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Konstantine Konstantinovich of Russia, Grand Duke Sergey Mikhaylovich of Russia, and Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley, and Elizabeth's faithful companion, Sister Varvara Yakovleva, who were all killed with her. Fyodor Remez, Grand Duke Sergei's personal secretary, who was killed as well, was not canonized. They are known as the Martyrs of Alapaevsk.

One priest of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad noted that martyrdom in the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with the martyr's personal actions but was instead related to why he or she was killed.Massie, Robert K., The Romanovs: The Final Chapter, Random House, , 1995, pp. 134-135 Other critics noted that the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad appeared to be blaming Jewish revolutionaries for the deaths and equating the political assassination with a ritual murder.King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, The Fate of the Romanovs, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., p. 495 Others rejected the family's being classified as new martyrs because they were not killed because of their religious faith. There was no proof that the execution was a ritual murder. Religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonizing the Tsar's family because they perceived him to have been a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution, and the suffering of his people. They said he was at least partially responsible for his own murder and the murders of his wife and children. For these opponents, the fact that the Tsar was, in private life, a kind man and a good husband and father did not override his poor governance of Russia. The Moscow Patriarchate in 2000 canonized the family as passion bearers: people who face death with resignation, in a Christ-like manner, as distinguished from martyrs, the latter historically killed for their faith. Proponents cited previous Tsars and Tsareviches who had been canonized as passion bearers, such as Tsarevich Dimitri, murdered at the end of the sixteenth century, as setting a precedent for the canonization of the Romanov family. They noted the piety of the family and reports that the Tsarina and her eldest daughter Olga prayed and attempted to make the sign of the cross immediately before they died. Despite their official designation as \\"passion-bearers\\" by the August 2000 Council, the family are referred to as \\"martyrs\\" in Church publications, icons, and in popular veneration by the people.\\"Patriarch Aleksy Visited the Place Where the Remains of the Royal Martyrs Had Been Burned\\" , Yekaterinburg, September 23, 2000, Pravoslavie.ruGROUNDS FOR CANONIZATION OF THE TSAR FAMILY EXCERPTS FROM THE REPORT OF METROPOLITAN OF KRUTITSA AND KOLOMNA JUVENALY (Posted originally on the official web site of the Moscow Patriarchate) The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were discovered in 1979. Remains of two of the children, believed to be Maria and Alexei, were missing from the unmarked grave. The discovery of the Romanov remains was not acknowledged by the government until 1989 during the glasnost period. Following confirmation of identities through forensic and DNA analysis, the Imperial Family was interred in a state funeral at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years after they were murdered.https://www.amazon.com/Yeltsin-Life-Timothy-J-Colton- ebook/dp/B00CW0PSUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8 It was not until 2007 that the remains of Alexei and one of his sisters were found at a second unmarked gravesite, about 70 meters from the first. On 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site at Ganina Yama near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in assassin Yakov Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old; and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found \\"shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber.\\".Hammer, Joshua. \\"Resurrecting the Czar\\", Smithsonian Magazine, November 2010 Preliminary testing indicated a \\"high degree of probability\\" that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on 22 January 2008. The Yekaterinburg region's chief forensic expert Nikolai Nevolin indicated the results would be compared against those obtained by foreign experts. On April 30, 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing proves that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters. With this result, all of the Tsar's family are accounted for. Since the late 20th century, believers have attributed healing from illnesses or conversion to the Orthodox Church to their prayers to Maria and Alexei, as well as to the rest of the family.

The scene depicts a supper in Tarragona, where James I of Aragon with his lords planned the conquest of Mallorca (1229) ruled by the Muslims (in the context of the Iberian Christian Reconquista) The 1313 Latin translation \\"Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum\\", possibly a copy from the original, translated by the Dominican friar Pere Marsili, by order of James II of Aragon, grandson of James I of Aragon, called \\"the Conqueror\\". The Llibre dels fets (), originally spelled Libre dels feyts (literally in English: \\"Book of Deeds\\"), is the autobiographical chronicle of the reign of James I of Aragon (1213‚Äì1276). It is written in Old Catalan in the first person and is the first chronologically of the four works classified as The Four Great Catalan Chronicles, all belonging to the early medieval Crown of Aragon (in the northeastern part of what is now Spain), and its first royal dynasty, the House of Barcelona. James I inherited as a child the titles of King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier, but also became by conquest King of Majorca and King of Valencia. James emphasises in his chronicles his conquest of Majorca (1229) and of Valencia (1238). James I of Aragon dedicates a couple of chapters to his mother Maria of Montpellier and his father Peter II of Aragon (called \\"Peter the Catholic\\"), who had been given the title of \\"Rex Catholicissimus\\" by the Pope after the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in which he helped Alfonso VIII of Castile fight against the Moors, one year before his death. Peter II of Aragon died defending his vassal lords of Occitania, who were accused of allowing the Cathar heresy to proliferate in their counties. He was killed in the Battle of Muret, fighting against the Crusader troops commanded by Simon de Montfort. Though the text of the Llibre dels fets was dictated and edited by James I, the actual writing was done by scribes, not James himself; it is written is colloquial language, representing the native tongue as spoken, and its style is direct. The conquest by James I in 1229 of Majorca, one of the Balearic Islands held by the Muslim Almohads, and his consequent founding of the Kingdom of Majorca, probably inspired him to start the dictation of his chronicles, he having had an active part in the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula (in the context of Europe's medieval Christian Crusades). The Llibre dels fets narrative ends with James' death in 1276. Though the original is lost, many ancient copies of the codex have survived. The oldest extant manuscript written in the original Catalan language, a copy dating to 1343, was commissioned by the abbot of the Poblet Monastery. An older manuscript dating to 1313, the \\"Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum\\", was the version translated into Latin from the Catalan original \\"Llibre dels Feyts del Rei en Jacme\\". The Latin translation is signed by the Dominican friar Pere Marsili, who was ordered by James II of Aragon (James I's grandson) to honour his grandfather's memory by promulgating his words in the internationally used Latin language.  Particular features  As the title itself indicates, more than a bare chronicle, the Llibre dels fets is in fact a \\"Book of Deeds\\". Studies conducted in the 1980s concluded that this medieval manuscript is of an undefined literary style, since it was dictated entirely orally. James I of Aragon, a cultivated man, dictated the entire book to royal scribes, who at that point in history commonly performed the labour of actually writing the king's words with pen on paper. Its style is informal and colloquial. Here is an extract of the first lines: > ... Raconta Mon Senyor San Jaume que la fe sense obres, morta es. Aquesta > paraula va voler complr Senyor en els nostres fets... > (English: ... says My Lord Saint James that faith without actions, is dead. > This word he wanted to accomplish, Lord, in our deeds...) The principal characteristics of James' style are: * Religious Feeling * The love of the King for his realms * Direct participation in the events described * Military and heroic spirit * Popular and improvised language  Structure  1619 Frontispiece of Catalan manuscript made by Jaume Ferrera In the Llibre del Fets, James I of Aragon describes his life and his most important actions, such as the conquest of the Muslim-held Valencia and Majorca. The narrative begins with his birth in 1203 and ends with his death in 1276. The prologue and epilogue are written in a different style, more erudite and perfectionist than the rest of the text, and presumably written after his death. James was generally very explicit in expressing himself, as shown in his recitation of his deeds: > E per tal que los h√≤mens coneguessen, quan haur√≠em passada aquesta vida > mortal, √ßo que n√≥s haur√≠em fet [...] e per dar eximpli a tots los altres > h√≤mes del m√≥n... > (English: So that men acknowledge, when we have passed this mortal life, > this that we have accomplished [,,,] and to give example to all the other > men of the world...) In the Latin translation of 1313 by Pere Marsili, the friar informs his readers that he has translated chapters from the manuscripts then kept in the royal archives, indicating that the texts of the chronicles already existed and that they were written in the vulgar language, i.e., not in Latin, but in Catalan. The oldest preserved copy of the manuscript in the Catalan language is the copy ordered in 1343, more than 60 years after James' death, by the Abbot of the Poblet Monastery. The text of the Catalan manuscript is nearly identical to that of the Latin translation, but the Catalan version cannot be a copy of the Latin version, as the Catalan one is written in the first person, mainly using the majestic plural \\"we\\", and only a few times the singular \\"I\\", while the Latin version is written in the third person, using the first person in only a few quotes. This fact makes it improbable that the Catalan manuscript comes from the Latin version. The internal structure of both versions seems to indicate two moments in time: the first part may have been dictated around 1240, shortly after James' conquest of Valencia. The facts before 1228 are explained in a brief, imprecise way even with significant errors, while from then on, the narrative shows greater detail and precision. The supposed second part might have been dictated around 1274, and has a similar structure; the facts from 1242-1265 are condensed in a few pages, while the later years are again explicated in great detail. The prologue and the section that describes his illness and death were probably written or dictated by someone in James' trust. The Catalan copy of 1343 and the Latin translation of 1313 have left posterity the same content.  General content  The content of the Llibre dels fets, the chronicles of James I, can be divided into four parts: # 1208‚Äì1228: Some chapters dedicated to his ancestors and parents, his mother (Maria of Montpellier) by whom he was Lord of Montpellier, and to his father (Peter II of Aragon \\"The Catholic\\"), by whom he was King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona and Count of Urgell. James' quite unexpected birth. Chapters dedicated to his father's death, known as Peter \\"The Catholic\\" (title of \\"Rex Catholicissimus\\" given to him by the Pope, after the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa against the Moors), and his death at the battle of Muret, while defending his vassal Lords of Occitania against the invading crusader troops, mostly Frankish, commanded by Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester in the context of the Cathar Crusade (or Albigensian Crusade, as it started at the southern city of Albi, while casually the Regent Queen of the Franks at that time was Blanche of Castile). James' captivity at the age of 5 after his father's death, and how Simon de Montfort wanted to marry him to his daughter (failed plan that would have brought the De Montfort family into the Crown of Aragon). Finally James was returned to Aragon, where the Templar Knights, a powerful military religious order within the medieval Crown of Aragon), guarded and raised him. James' childhood at Monzon Castle, (the Templars' main castle). He also explains his further marriage to Eleanor of Castile. # 1229‚Äì1240: The most detailed part of the \\"Llibre dels fets\\". The conquest of Majorca (1229). This would be the first step in the history of the Crown of Aragon. Shortly after that would come the conquest of Valencia in 1238. The book tries to prove how King James accomplishments were Divine Will. # 1240‚Äì1265: Describes the conflicts with the Saracen rebels from Valencia. # 1265‚Äì1276: Again a narrative describing the battles against the Moors. The conquest of Murcia. Also a lot of political episodes which claim to justify his actions. The last chapters, which explain the king's illness and death were written and included in the Chronicle presumably after James' death.  Language and style  A didactic and justifying intention is largely reflected throughout the chronicle as a religious impulse, indicating that James I believed the execution of the work was guided by divine providence. The king, who normally desired to appear as an epic hero, not only recounts military and political history in the narrative, but also frequently mentions small details of his daily life, as well as some of his most intimate thoughts. A \\"popular and vivid language\\" full of proverbs and colloquial expressions is used in the chronicles, which also quote foreign personages speaking other languages such as Aragonese, Galician-Portuguese (used by the Crown of Castile), Arabic or Old French.  Chapters  Chapter I: Prologue Chapters 2‚Äì4: Ancestors Chapter 5: The holiness of his conception and baptism Chapters 6‚Äì7: Dedicated to his parents Peter II of Aragon \\"the Catholic\\" and Maria of Montpellier. Chapter 8‚Äì9: Tragic death of his father King Peter II of Aragon \\"the Catholic\\" at the battle of Muret in 1213 defending his vassal lords, against the Frankish crusaders who were invading Occitania, in the context of the Albigensian Crusade (also called the Cathar Crusade). The Captivity of King James I of Aragon by Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, commander of the Frankish crusaders. Chapter 10: Liberation of James I of Aragon, \\"the Conqueror\\" (he is 6 or 7 years old) Chapter 11: Cortes de Lerida (Courts of Lerida) Chapters 12‚Äì14: James' stay at Monz√≥n Castle, where he was raised by the Templar Knights Chapters 15‚Äì16: 1st Revolt of the Nobility Chapters 17‚Äì19: Wedding with Eleanor of Castile Chapters 20‚Äì25: 2nd Revolt of the Nobility Chapters 26‚Äì34: 3rd Revolt of the Nobility Chapters 35‚Äì46: War for the County of Urgell Chapters 47‚Äì117: Conquest of Mallorca Chapters 118‚Äì124: Submission of the island of Menorca (within the Balearic Islands, from the Muslim taifas by the Treaty of Capdepera Chapters 125‚Äì126: Conquest of island of Ibiza in the Balearic Islands, from the Muslim taifas, all three islands forming the Christian Kingdom of Majorca) Chapters 127‚Äì289: Southern Conquest of Valencia from the Moors' 'taifa' (formation of Kingdom of Valencia)  Codices and editions  1313 Latin translation of the Llibre dels Fets, the Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum by Friar Pere Marsili following the order of James II of Aragon (grandson of James I of Aragon). Five codices of the text from the 14th century and two from the 15th are preserved, all based on a translation of the original Catalan text into Latin by the Dominican friar Pere Marsili at the order of King James' grandson (his namesake James II of Aragon). He intended to adapt the original text to contemporary manners and style, as can be read: > [...] So that the deeds of His glorious grandfather (James I), collected in > a truthful but vulgar style, shall be put to date and once translated to > Latin, form a single History volume, a full chronicle in which all the > actions of the king his grandfather (James I the Conqueror) will be woven > together.Latin language was used in the correspondence between Friar Pere > Marsili and James II of Aragon. Translation from the Catalan Wikipedia Friar Pere Marsili finished this royal assignment on 2 April 1313, and then petitioned the king that a copy of the manuscript be made for the Friars Preachers of Majorca, his homeland, to be used on the day of the \\"Feast of the Banner\\": > [...] with the purpose of the last day of the year, the annual feast which > commemorates the conquest of the city of Majorca, for God's glory and the > eternally worshiping memory of his Luckiest Prince (James I), and so the > friars who preach on this significative solemn date in front of the whole > clergy and people, could rely to this book, and more firmly be informed of > the truth of the facts.\\" The official delivery of the Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum domini Jacobi victorissimi principis was made on 2 June 1314 at the Church of the Friars Preachers (esgl√©sia dels frares predicadors) of Valencia. Six official copies of the Latin translation by Pere Marsili exist. Four dating from the 14th century (conserved respectively in the National Library of Catalonia, the Archives of the Kingdom of Majorca, the Archives of the Cathedral of Palma de Majorca and the University of Barcelona's Library). A copy from the 17th century is kept at the Archives of the Crown of Aragon and another from the 19th in the Real Academia de la Historia of Spain. * 1343 First Catalan original copy, ordered by the abbot of the Poblet Monastery.

On 11 November 1343, King Peter IV of Aragon sent a letter to the abbot of the Poblet Monastery demanding the return of the original codex In 1585 King Philip II of Spain visited the Poblet Monastery and ordered a copy of the chronicle for the Royal Library of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Madrid. 1380 Catalan copy contains two illustrations, both of friars; this first one depicts Dominican Friar Miguel Fabra i Berenguer de Castellbisbal. 1380 Catalan manuscript first page: \\"...says My Lord Saint James that faith without actions, is dead. This word he wanted to accomplish, Lord, in our deeds...\\" The second Catalan codex manuscript source, dating to 1380, comes directly from the Royal Chancellery of King Peter IV of Aragon, and must be a direct copy of the original, as the king himself commanded Johan de Barbastro to make it. The text in Latin: > Mandato serenissimi domini petri dei gratir regis Aragonum valentiae, > Majoricarum, cardinieae et Corsicae, Comitisque Barchinonae, Rossilionis et > Ceritaniae [...] Ego Iohannes de Barbastro de scribania predicti domini > Regis Aragonum, oriundus Cesaraugustae scripsi Ciuitate Barchinonae Anno a > Nativitate Dmi.

A relevant fact about this copy is that Johan de Barbastro used an official codex from the Royal Chancellerie (now disappeared). King Pere IV (\\"the Ceremonious\\") ordered three copies: one for Majorca, one for Barcelona and another for Valencia. Only the Majorcan copy has survived, and is now preserved in the National Library of Catalonia. This first printed edition was ordered and paid for by the Jury of the city of Valencia in 1557. Made in a period of historical inquiries, once the print was finished, a copy was sent to Madrid to King Philip II of Spain (known by the Catalans as Philip II of Castile) from the House of Habsburg, who had also been very interested in the manuscript codex kept in the Poblet Monastery. 1619 Catalan copy from Jaume Ferrera of the Poblet Monastery's manuscript. This faithful depiction is the second and last of the book, and has disappeared in the other copies. Other manuscripts have survived, all copies of the one made for the Poblet Monastery in 1343. There is one relevant codex between them conserved in the library of the University of Barcelona made by student Jaume Ferrera by order of his master, Prior Jaume Ramon Vila, who added a prologue, which is its singular feature. The Prior explains the reason he ordered the present copy of the Llibre dels fets, was \\"to deny the forgery issues that Castilian historians were throwing at Catalans\\". He indicates as well that the illustrations are faithful copies of the manuscript dated 1343 from the Poblet Monastery. The other relevant feature of this codex is the second original illustration that did not survive from the Poblet manuscript. In this picture the Mayor of the Palace, Hugh de Forcalquier, and Blasco de Alag√≥n are kneeling before James I.

Generally classed as a morality play, it illustrates the continuing influence of archaic forms of drama on the relatively \\"sophisticated\\" or even \\"decadent\\" theatre of the Caroline era. The play was entered into Register on November 9, 1632 and was published the following year in quarto by the bookseller William Cooke, who issued many of Shirley's plays in the 1630s, either alone or in partnership with Andrew Crooke. Shirley dedicated the volume to Edward Golding, of Colston, Northamptonshire, a personal friend. No data on the play's theatrical history has survived; it is not known when, or even if, the work was ever staged. The most likely date for the play's authorship may be 1630.Forsythe, p. 391. The existing play, \\"A moral masque in three scenes,\\" was later reworked and expanded by the author into a full five-act drama, and eventually published in 1659 under the title Honoria and Mammon.Forsythe, p. 392. 1630 was relatively late in the history of English Renaissance theatre for a morality play -- though the form, while unfashionable, was not entirely extinct in Shirley's era. Late examples include Four Plays in One (c. 1608-13), from the canon of John Fletcher, and The Sun's Darling (1624), a collaboration between Thomas Dekker and John Ford. As is often the case in the morality form, the characters in Shirley's Contention are known by generic titles more than personal names: Lady Honor, Lady Riches, Ingenuity, Gettings, the Courtier, the Soldier, the Vice, etc. (In the later expansion, Honoria and Mammon, the same characters are given personal names.) Synopsis At the start of the play, Ingenuity, a scholar, pays court to the Lady Riches, but the two quarrel. The Lady's other suitors, Gettings and Clod (Clod represents country gentlemen, while Gettings represents the London merchant class), also quarrel -- not with their Lady but with each other. The outcome of their dispute is that Clod challenges Gettings to a duel. Lady Honor also has her suitors -- in her case, the Courtier and Soldier ply their suits to her while Ingenuity watches. After Honor and Ingenuity have left them alone, the Courtier and Soldier also argue, and are about to fight, when their nemeses Honesty and No-Pay enter and scare them off. Next, Gettings and Clod are shown on the \\"field of honor,\\" about to start their duel. But they too are interrupted: Long Vacation and Foul-Weather-in-Harvest enter, and the two suitor/duellists reconcile because of their fear of these figures. (Long Vacation refers to the period at the end of the legal year in August and September, when business in the City of London is slack.) Lady Riches shows up, and accepts Gettings as her intended husband -- but grants a reversion of the office of husband to Clod.In early modern England, a reversion to an office meant that the reversion-holder would obtain the office when the office-holder has left it -- usually by death. The Soldier and Courtier also turn up, searching for Honor -- but they are distracted by the presence of Riches. Finally Honor and Inegnuity arrive to complete the cast: everyone else is surprised to learn that Inegnuity and Honor are now married -- though the news prompts a general reconciliation among all the members of the group.

During the late reign of Emperor Yang, Yang Yichen was one of the few Sui generals having success against agrarian rebels, but in 616, Emperor Yang, unhappy about Yang Yichen's mounting influences, removed him from his military position, and thereafter the agrarian rebels went unchecked. Yang Yichen died soon afterwards.  Background  Yang Yichen's father Yuchi Chong (Â∞âÈÅ≤Â¥á) was ethnically Xianbei and a distant relative of the general Yuchi Jiong. Yuchi Chong was a general during Northern Zhou and had his defense post at Mount Heng. At that time, the general Yang Jian was the commandant at nearby Ding Province (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly near Baoding, Hebei), and Yuchi Chong, believing Yang Jian to have great ambitions, befriended Yang Jian. After Yang Jian seized power as regent in 580, Yuchi Jiong, suspicious of Yang Jian's intentions, rebelled at Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei). When Yuchi Chong heard this, as he was a relative of Yuchi Jiong's, he threw himself into jail and begged Yang Jian for forgiveness. Yang Jian pardoned him and ordered him to report to the capital Chang'an to serve as one of Yang Jian's assistants. After Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou in 581, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen, he created Yuchi Chong the Duke of Qinxing. In 582, Yuchi Chong served under Daxi Zhangru (ÈÅîÂ•öÈï∑ÂÑí) in a campaign against Tujue's Shabol√ºe Khan Ashina Shetu, and while Daxi achieved victory, Yuchi died in the battle. At the time that Yuchi Chong died, his son Yuchi Yichen was said to be still young. Emperor Wen took Yuchi Yichen into the palace and raised him there, allowing him to inherit his father's titles. After he became a teenager, he served in the palace guard corps, and when Emperor Wen saw him, he was reminded of Yuchi Chong's contributions. He therefore issued an edict giving Yuchi Yichen a moderate amount of wealth, while bestowing the imperial clan surname of Yang on him and conferring him the status of the emperor's grandnephew. Soon afterwards, Emperor Wen made him the governor of Shan Province (ÈôùÂ∑û, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan).  Service during Emperor Wen's reign  Yang Yichen was considered to be honest and careful, with military leadership qualities, and Emperor Wen respected him. In 599, when Tujue's Bujia Khan Ashina Dianjue attacked, Yang Yichen was sent to face Tujue forces, and he repelled them. In 600, in conjunction with Shi Wansui (Âè≤Ëê¨Ê≠≤) the Duke of Taiping, he dealt Ashina Dianjue a major defeat. However, later that year, Shi was executed after false accusations by Yang Su, and Yang Yichen was not rewarded for his contributions. Sometime during Emperor Wen's late reign -- the Renshou era (601-604), Yang Yichen was promoted to be the commandant at Shuo Province (ÊúîÂ∑û, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).  During Emperor Yang's reign  In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, generally believe to be a murder ordered by his son, Yang Guang the Crown Prince. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Soon afterwards, Emperor Yang's younger brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han rose in rebellion at Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Yang Liang's general Qiao Zhongkui (Âñ¨ÈçæËëµ) afterwards put Li Jing (ÊùéÊôØ), the commandant of Dai Province (‰ª£Â∑û, roughly modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), who remained loyal to Emperor Yang, under siege. Emperor Yang ordered Yang Yichen to try to lift the siege against Li, and Yang Yichen was successful in defeating Qiao. After Yang Liang was defeated and forced to surrender to Yang Su, Yang Yichen was given material rewards and made the governor of Xiang Province. In 607, Emperor Yang recalled him to be the director of imperial clan affairs, and later the director of husbandry affairs. In 609, Yang Yichen served as a general in the largely successful campaign against Tuyuhun. In 612, he also served in Emperor Yang's first campaign against Goguryeo, commanding part of the force under Yuwen Shu the Duke of Xu that aimed to penetrate deep into Goguryeo territory, against its capital Pyongyang. While Yang Yichen was personally successful, the campaign was itself a major failure, and as a result, Yang Yichen was removed from his post. However, Emperor Yang soon restored him, and in 613, when Emperor Yang launched a second campaign against Tuyuhun, Yang Yichen again served under Yuwen in an attempt to attack Pyongyang, but when news arrived that Yang Su's son Yang Xuangan had rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang the campaign was abandoned. Afterwards, with much of Sui territory engulfed in agrarian rebellions, Yang Yichen was sent against the rebel leader Xiang Haiming (ÂêëÊµ∑Êòé), who had claimed imperial title near Chang'an, and Yang Yichen defeated Xiang. In 616, Emperor Yang sent Yang Yichen against another major rebel leader, Zhang Jincheng (ÂºµÈáëÁ®±), and Yang, after lulling Zhang into a sense of security, defeated him and forced him to flee, allowing another Sui general, Yang Shanhui (Ê•äÂñÑÊúÉ), to capture and execute Zhang. Yang Yichen then engaged another major rebel leader, Gao Shida (È´òÂ£´ÈÅî), who had claimed the title of Duke of Donghai. Around the new year 617, Gao, going against the advice of his subordinate Dou Jiande, engaged Yang Yichen, and Yang Yichen defeated and killed Gao and nearly captured Dou. However, believing that Dou to not pose a further threat, he did not pursue Dou further. Meanwhile, Emperor Yang and the prime minister Yu Shiji had become suspicious of Yang Yichen after his victories. Emperor Yang summoned Yang Yichen to his then-location at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and, ostensibly promoting him, made him the minister of ceremonies, while disbanding his troops. Yang Yichen died soon afterwards.  References  * Book of Sui, vol. 63. * History of Northern Dynasties, vol. 73. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 180, 181, 182, 183.

Northfield Park conducts more than 200 harness racing nights each year. It is owned by MGM Growth Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International.  History  Originally constructed in 1934, Northfield Park racetrack was originally known as Sportsman Park, with a focus on midget car racing. After 20 years as a successful car racing facility, interest began to wane and in 1956, Sportsman Park was demolished to make way for what would eventually become one of the nation's premier harness racing tracks under the leadership of Carl Milstein, a well known real estate developer and businessman. Carl Milstein purchased the track in 1972. The tracks' top race, The Battle of Lake Erie, has featured some of the greatest pacers in history including Jaguar Spur, Gallo Blue Chip, Falcon Seelster and Riyadh. in 2007, the race was won by World Champion Maltese Artist, driven by Brett Miller in a world record time of 1:49.4 for the mile. In early 2009, the Ohio Legislature initiated legislation that would allow each of the state's seven tracks, including Northfield, to install 2,000 slot machines under guidelines developed by the Ohio State Racing Commission. In July 2009, slot machines were approved, and were installed at Northfield Park pending the approval of Governor John Kasich. Northfield Park's owner, Brock Milstein, contributed over $500,000 to the campaign to legalize slot machines. The racino, renamed as Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, opened on December 18, 2013 with 2,300 video lottery terminals, under the management of Hard Rock International. In 2018, MGM Growth Properties bought the property from Milstein Entertainment for $1.02 billion. Hard Rock continued to operate the property under a management agreement with the new owners. On April 1, 2019, MGM Growth's majority owner, MGM Resorts International, bought the Rocksino's operating business from MGM Growth for $275 million in stock, assumed control from Hard Rock, and rebranded the property as MGM Northfield Park. MGM Resorts would lease the property from MGM Growth for initial rent of $60 million per year. The track's nickname is \\"The Home of the Flying Turns\\" and its motto \\"Every nineteen minutes the place goes crazy\\".  Trackside Lounge  In the spring of 2008 Northfield Park constructed the Trackside Lounge. Trackside at Northfield Park is a state-of-the-art Sports Bar, featuring three-dozen flat-screen television monitors, private seating areas, full bar service and snack menu. In addition to Northfield‚Äôs full simulcast agenda, Trackside broadcasts major sporting events including Indians, Cavs and Browns games, March madness, the World Series, Super Bowl, NASCAR and more. The Trackside Barbecue features award-winning ribs, pulled pork sandwiches and more, and food from the barbecue can be brought into the Trackside Lounge, or eaten in the barbecue tent pavilion. The RaceBook, a $600,000 companion renovation, mirrors the Trackside Lounge's design and elements, featuring hundreds of flat-screen tvs and private TV carrels or workstations.

Co- written with Nova Scotian writer/director Chaz Thorne (Just Buried), it is the story of class struggle, racial tensions in Haifax and boxing, set in the Canadian east coast port city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The film premiered on February 11, 2007, at the Berlin International Film Festival. The movie stars Danny Glover, Rossif Sutherland, Greg Bryk, Flex Alexander and Laura Regan. Poor Boy's Game opened in Halifax cinemas on November 9, 2007.  Plot  Donnie Rose (Rossif Sutherland) plays a former boxer who is released from prison after serving time for a vicious assault on a Black teen that left the teen physically and mentally disabled. The beating of the teen sparked outrage and further divided the historically segregated city of Halifax. Upon his release from prison, he is surprised by a hero's 'welcome home' party at his brother Keith Rose's ( Greg Bryk) house and other members of the White community in Halifax. While at the party Donnie is confronted by the victim's father George Carvery (Danny Glover) who is holding a gun contemplating shooting Donnie to avenge the assault of his son. After a tense, heated exchange between George and Keith who is wielding a baseball bat, Donnie tells George \\"Just do what you came here to do\\" . After contemplating for a few moments George returns to his car and drives back to his mostly African Nova Scotian North End Halifax- area home. At this time, we get the first glance at his family, his wife Ruth Carvery (Tonya Williams) and his mentally and physically challenged son Charles (K. C. Collins). The condition of Charles has an obvious strain on their marriage, as just the sight of Charles condition forces them to come to grips that he will never again lead a 'normal life'. The release of Donnie from prison is much to the chagrin of members of the Black community in Halifax. Ossie Parris (Flex Alexander) a famous boxing champion challenges Donnie to a fight in the hopes of seeking retribution for the vicious attack that left Charles disabled, offer him $20,000 to participate in the prize fight. Knowing that Ossie will use the opportunity to murder Donnie in the ring, George offers to train Donnie in order from keeping him from being killed. Later in the movie members of the Black community attempt to enter a night club which has an unofficial policy of not allowing Blacks to enter. The clubs security force which is headed by Keith, Donnie and other members of the White community, refuse entry to the Black would be party goers. A fight at the club's entrance ensues with gunfire breaking out and a car being lit on fire (the scene is to resemble the Halifax race riot in 1991 in which over 150 Black and White clashed outside a downtown Halifax bar, after Black men were continually being denied entry in local bar establishments due to their race). Looking for further retribution Keith's crew burned down the Black community church. Members of Ossie's crew then kidnap and savagely beat Keith to death, leaving him at the same location where the beating of Charles took place years earlier. Donnie then goes to the Halifax Black Baptist Church during Sunday congregation to kill the culprits, but then leaves the church, instead deciding to turn in the suspects. Days before the fight Donnie and George meet at the same place where both their loved ones suffered brutal attacks, and they share a deep moment that put the film in perspective. George explains that he has a resenting hate in heart from all his years of struggle, and tells Donnie that he has the same hate in his heart and he must let it go. It is then that it was revealed that it was, in fact Keith that brutally beat Charles, and that he only confessed because he was a minor and would have served less time than his brother. On fight night Donnie enters the ring to a chorus of boos from the crowd. The fight goes back and forth between both fighters landing decisive blows. With George and his family in attendance, Charles suffers an 'episode' and climbs in the ring, causing an already agitated crowd to throw chairs and enter the ring themselves. A riot breaks out in which both Ossie and Donnie fight off crazed fight fans. The fight is subsequently forfeited and Donnie hangs up his gloves to symbolize the giving up of his hate.  Development  Inspired to write a play about race in Halifax, due to his cousin being violently murdered by his cousin's girlfriends, ex-boyfriend who is Black. Thorne recalled, \\" It got me thinking about race- and race in Halifax.\\"[1]\\"That was the original inspiration for (the story).\\"[1] Years later in 1999 Thorne writes a play called Poor Boys Game, which centers around race, revenge, and forgiveness. While working in Toronto as a struggling actor, Thorne screenplay was chosen for one of the six finalists for Toronto International Film Festival Pitch This competition. Although he doesn't win, panel judge Ralph Zimmerman (who was Clement Virgo agent) suggest he meet with Virgo to discuss developing the screenplay for the big screen. By the autumn of 2005, the script is completed after 17 drafts. Virgo and his business partner at Conquering Lion Damon D' Oliveira fly to L.A to meet with Danny Glover to star in the film. Glover's commitment to the lead role is enough to trigger financing from Telefilm, the Nova Scotia Film Development Corporation, Ontario Media Development Corporation and The Movie Network. In the spring of 2006, Virgo begins casting for the movie and auditions over 100 actors to play the role of Donnie Rose. He later chooses Rossif Sutherland -half-brother of Kiefer Sutherland- which many though a risky move since Sutherland was virtually unknown at the time. However, Virgo justified his choice in Sutherland believing that he could cast a young actor will be able to tell the story. Adding to the controversy of casting Sutherland, is that he is 20 pounds overweight months before the shooting of the film. However, he gets into fighting trim, by converting the 20 pounds of fat to muscle. While filming the movie in the summer of 2006, Virgo only has three days to cover the climatic boxing sequence, which he calls the \\"most daunting aspect of the film.\\"  Authenticity  120x120px The film was shot in Halifax Nova Scotia, and did a very good job of maintaining the region's authenticity. The name Carvery is a popular name in the African Nova Scotian community. The film's connection of the Black community with the Baptist church is also salient. The club in which the riot took place was meant to take place at the Rosa's Cantina on Argyle St, where it has been alleged that security regularly discriminate against Black patrons. Many scenes were shot in the North End and reference is made to Uniacke Square. The Burning of the Church is a prophetic scene, as later in 2006, Black Cultural Centre in Dartmouth was bombed by six Molotov cocktails; less than two months later the Black Loyalist Heritage Society's office in Birchtown was burned to the ground.  Misinterpreted Discourse  While the film used boxing as a metaphor for racial struggle, many critics dismissed the film as merely a boxing movie. The Canadian newspapers failed to mention the significance of Virgo's representation of Halifax, nor did they reference the racial tension of the film in any but the most cursory manner. Virgo explains in an interview that there is more to the movie than boxing. He says \\"There have been some great boxing sequences in the film,\\" He furthers this by saying \\"If you‚Äôre going to have a boxing set piece in your movie, the bar is set pretty high‚Ä¶Part of what I to do was not just make it about action, but about dramatic conflict. To try to tell a story. So you‚Äôre constantly trying to figure out what is going on with our main characters at every single point\\".  Racial Tribalism In Halifax  Earl (Cory Bowles) who is also a plays a leading role on the Canadian hit series The Trailer Park Boys is mixed race and aligns himself the Donnie's White Posse. During the fight seen at the night club, he is called an 'UncleTom' by the Black patrons for choosing his Whiteness over identifying himself as an African Nova Scotian. An ongoing discourse in Nova Scotia that has deep roots in the slave trade and the pseudo 'one drop rule'.  Critical reception  Although the film was well received overseas, many Canadian movie critics dismissed it as a subpar boxing film. As National Post film critic Jay Stone put it, \\"this isn‚Äôt Raging Bull. It's not even Rocky\\". The review by Rick Groen in The Globe and Mail was extremely critical of the film stated that any attempt to find the film even \\"remotely inspiring\\" should be \\"beat[en] back with a hockey stick\\". He went even further by saying, Poor Boy's Game was a \\"top-heavy melodrama that hopes to explore the city's racial divide and concomitant cycle of violence. Hopes to but doesn‚Äôt, leaving us with a big theme in vain search of a credible narrative. However a few critics were able to catch the nuances of the film context including Sean Flinn of the Globe and Mail who understood the film was \\"Set in various working-class areas of Halifax, the film uses boxing as a lens on themes such as racism, vengeance, redemption and forgiveness\\".

Football at the United Kingdom was at a low point in 1959 and 1960, following the failure of the national sides (except Wales and Ireland), to perform well in the 1958 FIFA World Cup two years before. A part of the problem involved the deaths of senior members of all four national sides at the Munich air disaster in early 1958. England had also suffered a further loss of confidence following poor form in a pre-season tour of the Americas, losing three games in a row to Brazil, Peru 4‚Äì1 and Mexico. An 8‚Äì1 victory over a weak United States in the final match did little to raise their spirits. The title was shared between three teams who were unable to beat each other but all managed a victory over the hapless Irish. The Scots started well, with a 4‚Äì0 drubbing of their opponents in Belfast whilst the English and Welsh played out a tame draw. This set the tone for the tournament, with the Irish losing their subsequent matches with more respectable scorelines but still unable to gain a point. The Scots could not capitalise on their good start and were held by England and Wales in their subsequent matches whilst the Welsh took their draws and narrowly beat Ireland in their last match to claim their own third share of the title. Goal difference was not at this stage used to differentiate between the teams. if it had been, Scotland would have won with Wales and England again tied for second.

During his time in the Senate, he represented various portions of southwestern Illinois. At the time of his death, he was the most senior member of the Illinois Senate. In addition to his service in the Illinois Senate, he served as the Chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party from 1986 to 1990. Early life Demuzio was born May 7, 1941, in Gillespie. He attended SS. Simon and Jude Catholic School and Gillespie High School. He went on to become Executive Director of the Illinois Valley Economic Development Corporation. Illinois Senate He was first elected in 1974 in an upset against Senator A.C. \\"Junie\\" Bartulis. After that election, he handily beat most of his opponents and during the later half of his career ran unopposed. At the beginning of his Senate tenure, Demuzio became part of a group of legislators called the \\"Crazy 8\\" which included, among others, Terry L. Bruce and Dawn Clark Netsch. Two years later, the group teamed up with Harold Washington and other members of the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus to win legislative reforms from Thomas Hynes by withholding support for his election as Senate President. Keeping with his maverick ways, he ran for Secretary of State on a slate with independent Democratic Governor Dan Walker. He lost the Democratic primary to Alan J. Dixon who would serve as Secretary of State until his election to the United States Senate. In 1983, he was appointed as an Assistant Majority Leader and reappointed each session until the Democrats lost their majority during the 1992 election. After that he remained in Democratic leadership as an Assistant Minority Leader. When the Democrats retook the Senate in 2002, he was subsequently appointed the Senate Majority Leader. During his time in the Senate, he commuted to his home in Carlinville rather than stay in Springfield. =Education= One of Demuzio's focuses in the Senate was education. In 1981, he received his B.A. in education and human services and his M.A. in education and public policy in 1996, both from Sangamon State University (now University of Illinois at Springfield). In 1977, he secured state matching funds to create the Orr Research Center, a University of Illinois facility in Pike County. He was the Chief Sponsor of SB 0566 which mandated that if a child is deaf, hard of hearing, blind, or visually impaired and he or she might be eligible to receive services from the Illinois School for the Deaf or the Illinois School for the Visually Impaired, the school district shall notify the parents or guardian. The bill was signed into law July 22, 2003. Outside of the Senate, he was a member of the Board of Trustees for Blackburn College in Carlinville, where the Demuzio Student Center is named in his honor.http://www3.illinois.gov/pressreleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=3&RecNum;=880 =Other Legislative Initiatives= In 1999, he helped to create the Penny Severns Breast and Cervical Cancer Research Fund, named after the late Penny Severns who died of breast cancer in 1998. He also advocated for legislation to increase the Rural Bond Bank's bond authorization and the maximum amount used to purchase securities issued by certain units of local government, ushered the creation of the Downstate Illinois Sports Facilities Authority through the Senate and wrote the Electronic Transfer Act. =49th District= During his time in the Illinois Senate, Demuzio represented the 49th district, located in southwestern Illinois. From 1991 until 2001, the district stretched from Christian County in the east to Calhoun County in the west and included Montgomery, Bond, Macoupin, Greene, Jersey, Morgan counties and a small portion of Madison County. During the 2001 redistricting process, his district remained largely the same, though it added a small portion of Fayette County.http://elections.il.gov/Downloads/VotingInformation/PDF/Districts/RepDist98.pdfhttp://elections.il.gov/Downloads/VotingInformation/PDF/Districts/RepDist97.pdf =Committee Assignments= Demuzio spent the bulk of his career as a member of the Education committee. He also served on the Legislative Audit Commission and served on the Steering Committee to re-examine the Illinois Constitution. He was also involved in the redistricting process in both 1991 and 2001 as a member of the Legislative Redistricting Commissions. Democratic Party Chairman Demuzio served as the Democratic Central Committeeman for Illinois's 20th congressional district along with Central Committeewoman Penny Severns. In 1986, he became the chair of the Illinois Democratic Party after Calvin Sutker lost his race for Central Committeeman in Illinois's 9th congressional district, making Sutker ineligible to be chair of the party. Due to disunity amongst the central committee members from Chicago, he was able to be elected with support from downstate members. Prior to being elected chair, two followers of Lyndon LaRouche won primaries for Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State respectively. Adlai Stevenson III, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, formed the Solidarity Party as he did not want to run alongside anybody associated with LaRouche's organization. Subsequently, Demuzio and the party had to create a campaign to get Democratic voters to split their tickets. Though Stevenson lost to James R. Thompson, the Democrats kept majorities in the Illinois General Assembly and gained two seats on the then-elected University of Illinois Board of Trustees. In 1990, Demuzio was ousted as Chair by Gary LaPaille. After his tenure, he was largely credited with rebuilding the infrastructure of the Illinois Democratic Party. Death and legacy In August 2003, Demuzio was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer which he died of on April 27, 2004. After his death, his seat was filled by wife Deanna Demuzio who served until 2011. The portion of Interstate 55 in Illinois that goes from the final exit in Springfield to Illinois Route 138 in Macoupin County was renamed in his honor. In 2005, the State of Illinois created the Vince Demuzio Memorial Colon Cancer Fund. It is funded by a check off on individual income tax forms and the money is then distributed to public or private entities in Illinois for the purpose of funding research applicable to colon cancer patients by the Department of Public Health. Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville currently runs the Vince Demuzio Governmental Internship Program, which allows students paid internships with various state legislators and state agencies. One of his former interns, Andy Manar, was elected to the Illinois Senate in 2012 in a newly-created district including much of Demuzio's old district.

He was a confidant of Emperor Yang (Yang Guang) and was instrumental in Yang Guang's displacement of his brother Yang Yong as crown prince; therefore, after Yang Guang became emperor, Yuwen Shu became exceedingly powerful and was one of two generals who spearheaded Yangdi's efforts in the Goguryeo-Sui Wars. His son Yuwen Huaji later led a coup against Emperor Yang in 618 and, after killing Emperor Yang, briefly claimed imperial title in 619, but was soon captured and killed. Another son of Yuwen Shu, Yuwen Shiji, however, was a friend of Tang Dynasty's founder Li Yuan (Emperor Gaozu), and after Li Yuan established Tang remained an influential official.  Background  Yuwen Shu's ancestors were originally named Poyetou (Á†¥ÈáéÈ†≠) and were ethnically Xianbei. As they became followers of the Yuwen branch of the Xianbei, their names were named to Yuwen. His great-great-grandfather Yuwen Juyudun (ÂÆáÊñá‰æ∞ËàáÊï¶), great-grandfather Yuwen Changshou (ÂÆáÊñáÈï∑Â£Ω), and grandfather Yuwen Gu (ÂÆáÊñáÂ≠§) all served under Northern Wei as army officers at Woye Garrison (Ê≤ÉÈáé, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia). Yuwen Shu's father Yuwen Sheng (ÂÆáÊñáÁõõ) was a general under Northern Zhou and eventually served as the minister of imperial clan affairs, one of the six main ministers under Northern Zhou's six-department governmental structure. It is not known when Yuwen Shu was born. When he was young, he became known for his skills at riding and archery. Because of his father's achievements, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou, he was made a mid-level governmental official. He was much favored by Emperor Wu's regent Yuwen Hu, and he became a commander of Yuwen Hu's personal guards. After Emperor Wu killed Yuwen Hu and personally took power in 572, he made Yuwen Shu the deputy minister of imperial clan affairs, and eventually, he was created the Duke of Boling, and then the Duke of Puyang. In 580, after the death of Emperor Wu's son and successor Emperor Xuan, Emperor Xuan's father-in-law Yang Jian seized power as regent, and the general Yuchi Jiong, suspicious of Yang's intentions, rose against him at Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei). Yang sent the general Wei Xiaokuan against Yuchi, and Yuwen served under Wei. He defeated Yuchi's general Li Jun (ÊùéÈõã), and later, with other generals, defeated Yuchi's son Yuchi Dun (Â∞âÈÅ≤ÊÉá). Eventually, after Wei was victorious over Yuchi Jiong, forcing Yuchi Jiong to commit suicide, Yuwen's title was promoted to Duke of Bao.  During Emperor Wen's reign  In 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Xuan's young son Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and starting Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Yuwen Shu served as a general for Sui. In winter 588, when Emperor Wen launched a major attack on rival Chen Dynasty, Yuwen Shu participated in the campaign, and after the generals Han Qinhu (ÈüìÊìíËôé) and Heruo Bi (Ë≥ÄËã•Âºº) crossed the Yangtze River to attack the Chen capital Jiankang, Yuwen advanced to the nearby fortress of Shitou to aid Han and Heruo. After Heruo and Han captured Jiankang and the Chen emperor Chen Shubao, the Chen generals Xiao Huan (Ëï≠Áìõ) and Xiao Yan (Ëï≠Â∑ñ) were holding out in modern Zhejiang. Yuwen was sent, along with Yan Rong (ÁáïÊ¶Æ), to attack Xiao Huan and Xiao Yan, and he defeated Xiao Huan and forced Xiao Yan to surrender. After the completion of the campaign, in recognition of his contributions, Emperor Wen gave his son Yuwen Huaji a mid-level governmental post, while making Yuwen Shu himself the commandant at An Province (ÂÆâÂ∑û, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei). After the campaign against Chen, Emperor Wen's son Yang Guang the Prince of Jin, who was in overall command of the campaign against Chen, became the commandant at Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Yuwen Shu was friendly with Yang Guang, and Yang Guang, whose ambitions included displacing his older brother Yang Yong the Crown Prince as his father's heir, therefore requested in 600 and received Emperor Wen's approval to have Yuwen's command post moved to Shou Province (Â£ΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Lu'an, Anhui), closer to Yang Guang's post. At one point, Yang Guang consulted Yuwen Shu as to how he could displace his brother. Yuwen suggested entering an alliance with the powerful official Yang Su‚Äîand forming the relationship with Yang Su through Yang Su's brother and confidant Yang Yue (Ê•äÁ¥Ñ). Yang Guang therefore gave Yuwen much treasure and had him go to the capital Chang'an to try to meet Yang Yue. Yuwen offered some of the treasures pillaged from Chen to Yang Yue, and then also intentionally lost to Yang Yue when the gambled. After he had become sufficiently familiar to Yang Yue, he revealed to Yang Yue that it was Yang Guang's intent to enter into an alliance with Yang Su‚Äîpersuading Yang Yue that given that Yang Su did not have a warm relationship with Yang Yong, his family would be in danger if Yang Yong were to succeed Emperor Wen. Yang Yue, in turn, persuaded Yang Su, who subsequently persuaded Emperor Wen and Emperor Wen's wife Empress Dugu that Yang Yong should be deposed. Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu agreed, and in 600 Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and replaced him with Yang Guang. Yang Guang made Yuwen Shu a commander of his palace guards and gave his daughter, the Princess Nanyang, to Yuwen Shu's son Yuwen Shiji (ÂÆáÊñáÂ£´Âèä) in marriage. In 604, while Emperor Wen was ill, Yuwen Shu was one of the guard commanders that Yang Guang summoned to guard Emperor Wen's vacation palace Renshou Palace (‰ªÅÂ£ΩÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Emperor Wen soon died‚Äîa death that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, generally believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang. Yang Guang then took the throne as Emperor Yang, and he put Yang Yong to death.  During Emperor Yang's reign  After Emperor Yang took the throne, Yuwen Shu, as one of his confidants, became more and more powerful, eventually becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the realm; Emperor Yang also elevated his title to Duke of Xu (Ë®±ÂúãÂÖ¨). In 607, Yuwen, in order to allow Yun Dingxing (Èõ≤ÂÆöËàà), the father of Yang Yong's favorite concubine Consort Yun, to join Emperor Yang's regime, persuaded Yun that Yang Yong's sons needed to die, and then persuaded Emperor Yang of the same. Emperor Yang poisoned Yang Yong's oldest son (by Consort Yun), Yang Yan (Ê•äÂÑº) the former Prince of Changning, and exiled Yang Yong's other sons, but eventually had them all killed. It was only after the deaths of Yang Yong's sons that Yuwen was able to recommend Yun to Emperor Yang, who made Yun one of his chief engineers. In 607, while Emperor Yang was conducting a tour of the northern border, he arrived at Yulin Commandery (Ê¶ÜÊûó, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Yuwen Shu's sons Yuwen Huaji and Yuwen Zhiji (ÂÆáÊñáÊô∫Âèä), who were mid- level officials in Emperor Yang's government, secretly conducted forbidden trade with Tujue. Emperor Yang was incensed and ordered that they be executed, but at the last minute spared them, formally awarding them to their father as slaves. In 608, the official Pei Ju persuaded Tiele to attack Tuyuhun, and after Tiele defeated Tuyuhun, Tuyuhun's Bujiabo Khan Murong Fuyun offered to surrender to Sui. Emperor Yang sent his cousin Yang Xiong (Ê•äÈõÑ) the Prince of Ande and Yuwen to rendezvous with Murong Fuyun to accept his surrender, but once Yuwen arrived at Linqiang (Ëá®Áæå, in modern Xining, Qinghai), Murong Fuyun, fearful of the strength of Yuwen's force, changed his mind and fled west, and Yuwen attacked Tuyuhun's trailing people instead, capturing thousands of Tuyuhun's people. Emperor Yang thus established four commanderies over the former Tuyuhun territory. In 612, Yuwen Shu participated in Emperor Yang's first campaign against Goguryeo. Emperor Yang's main forces put Goguryeo's key northern city Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) under siege (although he was ultimately unable to capture it), but sent Yuwen with a branch army to head deep south, across the Yalu River, heading directly toward the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang. However, on the way, his army ran out of food supplies and was forced to withdraw, and as it did, Goguryeo forces gave chase and crushed him. When Emperor Yang retreated as well, he put Yuwen under imprisonment, but still remembering his relationship with Yuwen, did not execute him, but reduced him to commoner rank. However, soon he had Yuwen's title restored. In 613, Emperor Yang launched his second campaign against Goguryeo‚Äîand again, he himself headed for Liaodong while ordering Yuwen and Yang Yichen to head for Pyongyang. In the midst of the campaign, however, news arrived that Yang Su's son Yang Xuangan had rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang. Emperor Yang was forced to abandon the campaign against Goguryeo, and he sent Yuwen and Qutu Tong (Â±àÁ™ÅÈÄö) ahead of himself, to reinforce the forces near Luoyang against Yang Xuangan. Yuwen, Qutu, and the generals defeated Yang Xuangan, and Yang Xuangan fled west, intending to attack Chang'an. Yuwen, Qutu, Wei Wensheng (Ë°õÊñáÊòá) and Lai Hu'er (‰æÜË≠∑ÂÖí) gave chase, catching up with Yang Xuangan at Hongnong (ÂºòËæ≤, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and dealt him a final crushing blow. Yang Xuangan tried to flee further, but knowing that he could not escape, had his brother Yang Jishan (Ê•äÁ©çÂñÑ) kill him. Pursuant to Yuwen's suggestions, Emperor Yang had Yang Jishan and Yang Xuangan's strategist Wei Fusi (ÈüãÁ¶èÂó£) put to death in cruel manner. In 615, Yuwen was involved in a major massacre of a noble clan. While Yuwen was still Emperor Yang's guard commander when Emperor Yang was crown prince, Li Hun (ÊùéÊ∏æ) the son of the senior noble Li Mu (ÊùéÁ©Ü) the Duke of Shen, who had died in 586, had become angry at his nephew Li Yun (ÊùéÁ≠†), who had inherited the title of Duke of Shen, and he had Li Yun assassinated, while framing his cousin Li Jutan (ÊùéÁûøÊõá) for the murder and had Li Jutan executed. He then bribed Yuwen, his brother-in-law, with a promise that if he were allowed to inherit the ducal title, he would give Yuwen half of the stipend received from the fief. Yuwen persuaded the Crown Prince to in turn persuade Emperor Wen to agree, so Li Hun inherited the title. However, after Li Hun received the title, he only paid the bribe for two years and then stopped. Yuwen, resentful of Li Hun's broken promise, planned his revenge. By 615, there had been rumors throughout Sui territory that the next emperor would be named Li. Emperor Yang therefore particularly became suspicious of Li Hun's nephew Li Min (ÊùéÊïè), the husband of his sister Yang Lihua's daughter Yuwen Eying (ÂÆáÊñáÂ®•Ëã±, who was also the daughter of Northern Zhou's Emperor Xuan, as the Yang Lihua, the Princess Leping, was Emperor Xuan's wife and empress), because Li Min's nickname was \\"Hong'er\\" (Ê¥™ÂÖí), meaning \\"son of a flood,\\" and Emperor Wen had long ago dreamed that a flood would overflow the capital. Emperor Yang therefore tried to hint to Li Min that he should commit suicide, but Li Min did not. Yuwen Shu then had the official Pei Renji (Ë£¥‰ªÅÂü∫) falsely accuse Li Hun of plotting treason. Emperor Yang put Yuwen Shu in charge of the investigation, and Yuwen Shu manufactured evidence, particularly persuading Yuwen Eying that Emperor Yang would have the Lis executed anyway, and that she should save herself. Yuwen Eying thus wrote a confession implicating both Li Hun and Li Min. Li Hun, Li Min, and 32 of their clansmen were executed, and their other relatives were exiled. Several months later, Yuwen Eying was also poisoned. In fall 615, Yuwen accompanied Emperor Yang on a tour of the northern frontier. The Eastern Turk leader Shibi Khan took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack against Yanmen Commandery in reprisal against various offenses by the emperor. His Chinese wife, the princess Yicheng, secretly sent a warning of the Turkish plans to Emperor Yang, who took refuge at the commandery seat in present-day Daixian, Shanxi.. The Turks began their siege of the town on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. Yuwen suggested Emperor Yang select a few thousand elite cavalry soldiers to attempt a break out, but Su Wei and Fan Zigai (Ê®äÂ≠êËìã) persuaded Emperor Yang not to attempt this. Instead, at the suggestion of his brother-in-law Xiao Yu, the emperor sought more help from Princess Yicheng, who was one of his relatives but‚Äîaccording to Turkish custom‚Äîwas in charge of managing military affairs at home in her husband's absence. She sent Shibi Khan a false report of a northern attack on the Khaganate; hearing this and learning of Chinese reinforcements on their way to the emperor's relief, the khan abandoned the siege and returned north. Su subsequently suggested to Emperor Yang that he return to Chang'an, but at Yuwen's suggestion, Emperor Yang went to Luoyang instead. In fall 616, while Emperor Yang was inquiring about the status of agrarian rebellions (by this point, most of Sui territory was in fact engulfed in agrarian rebellions), Yuwen, in order to placate him, informed him that the rebellions had largely been suppressed. Su, however, truthfully informed Emperor Yang that the rebellions were causing major problems for Sui rule. Emperor Yang, not happy about the news, soon considered putting Su to death, but eventually only reduced Su to commoner rank. Soon thereafter, seeing that Emperor Yang wanted to go back to Jiangdu, the capital of Yang Province, Yuwen formally suggested that he does so, and Emperor Yang agreed. Yuwen followed Emperor Yang there, and became ill at Jiangdu. He died in winter 616. Pursuant to his dying wishes, Emperor Yang pardoned Yuwen Huaji and Yuwen Zhiji, returning them to governmental service.

It is the closing track on their fourth album, 1971's Fragile. The compositional credits go to Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, and Chris Squire, though keyboardist Rick Wakeman contributed some uncredited sections. The song eventually rose to become the band's fifth most-played song,Forgotten Yesterdays Yes tour log, retrieved 2 March 2007. and appears on Yessongs, Classic Yes, In a Word: Yes (1969‚Äì), and many other studio and live retrospectives. The song was featured in the 1998 comedy-drama film Buffalo '66. Meaning According to Anderson, the song is about being lost in the city. This was explained on many tours. In the Big Generator (1987) tour, Anderson said that the song is about the power and energy of the sunrise. In 1978, however, he had said that the song was about the power of love. Sometimes, he made other comments regarding its meaning. For example, in the 16 October 1971 show, Anderson stated that the organ in the song is inaudible and that the song will be performed without it. He further noted that the organ is \\"one of the best jokes in the business.\\" Content and structure The song begins with a churning, bass-heavy riff that alternates between and time. After one full sequence, it merges into a new, slightly funky section in that lasts for a minute and a half. It afterwards breaks back into three full cycles of the main riff. At around 3:25, after the final cycle, the song switches to a much softer style, where Jon Anderson begins singing. This section starts in but includes many individual sequences, including a quirky riff that appears in various speeds and arrangements. The song gradually builds in intensity, eventually including the main riff interspersed with the other sections. A brief classical snippet of Rick Wakeman's is used as well in both classical and rock arrangements. The song itself ends very abruptly around 10:35, but a reprise of \\"We Have Heaven\\" from earlier on the album is included as a hidden track, extending it to 11:27 (11:32 on the 2003 release). Some vinyl pressings of the album, as well as most pre-recorded tape editions, end without this reprise. At either length, it is the longest song on the album. Original North American pressings of Fragile contain the reprise, but list \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\"'s timing as 10:34, not reflecting its inclusion. Rick Wakeman contributed to the writing of \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" (and fellow album piece \\"South Side of the Sky\\") by adding piano interludes to both songs, but was not credited because of contractual conflicts. He was instead promised more money by Atlantic studio executives, which he claims he never saw. Live versions A number of live versions were released: * Yessongs (Close to the Edge Tour) * Progeny: Seven Shows from Seventy-Two (Close to the Edge Tour) * Yes ‚Äì Symphonic Live, 2002, (Heineken Music Hall, Amsterdam) * The Word is Live (Tormato Tour) * Yesyears (Big Generator Tour) * An Evening of Yes Music Plus (Performed by Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, on their tour) * Live at Montreux 2003 (Full Circle Tour) * Union Live (Union Tour) * Like It Is: Yes at the Mesa Arts Center (Heaven & Earth Tour) When performed live, the song was mostly performed the same as the studio version, accounting for obvious differences in instrumentation. Of course, the introductions changed as well. In the early part of the Big Generator tour, the main riff was worked into an instrumental version of \\"Almost Like Love\\", which led off the show. Progressive metal band Dream Theater paid tribute to Yes with a live cover of this song, which is included on their Uncovered 2003-2005 official bootleg. Dance punk band LCD Soundsystem also paid tribute to this song during their final performance, blending it into their song \\"Tired\\".

He was also a member of the Buffalo Bills. He is the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen.  High school  Olsen was born to Lynn Jay and Merle Olsen. He attended Logan High School in Logan, Utah from 1963 to 1966. He was a three-year starter on the varsity football team as defensive tackle and offensive tackle. An all-around athlete, he earned eight varsity letters in football, basketball and track. While a Logan High Grizzly, Olsen was voted All-Division, All-Region, All-State, and All-American recognition in football, as well as being voted All-Division, All-Region in basketball (averaging 18 points a game as a senior). He was on the top 100 recruits list in football in 1966. He received over 40 college football scholarship offers, and made campus visits to Stanford, the University of Iowa, University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and Purdue University.  College  Phil Olsen was a three-year letterman and three-year starter, and in 1969 was a consensus All-America selection for the Utah State University Aggies, in Logan. Olsen was an Alpha Sigma Nu Honorary as one of top 12 USU Seniors, 1970, and like his brother Merlin is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Olsen was also the Aggie Team Captain, 1969 Team MVP, and the 1969 USU Athlete of the Year. He received the Wayne Estes Memorial Award, 1970 for \\"Top USU Student/Athlete/Citizen\\". His jersey No. 90 was retired in 1970. After his senior season he played in the East West Shrine Game, the Hula Bowl, and College All-Star games. In Olsen's junior year of 1968 the Aggies were 7‚Äì3 and had wins over the University of Wisconsin, Memphis State University, West Texas State, Utah and BYU. He was voted honorable mention All-America honors that season. In his sophomore year of 1967 the Aggies were 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 and were seven points from a 10‚Äì0 season. USU lost to Colorado State University 16‚Äì14 on a controversial officiating call that cost the team a potential game- winning field goal attempt. The Aggies also lost to New Mexico State 10‚Äì9 on a failed two-point conversion that tipped off the receiver's hands in the end zone, which would have won the game. USU tied Wichita State 3‚Äì3 in the season opener, in which the Aggie defense held Wichita State to 65 total yards and ‚àí2 yards rushing. (Former Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson was the WSU coaching staff at that time.) Wichita State amassed only 65 yards in that game, the third-best effort in USU history. The Aggies held San Diego State University to ‚àí5 yards rushing and the University of the Pacific to ‚àí35 yards rushing, setting the then school record in that category in the process.Utah State University Media Guide Olsen was co-captain of the freshman football team and played on the freshman basketball team as well (freshmen were not allowed to play NCAA varsity sports until 1972). Dale Brown, of LSU fame, was Olsen's hoops coach as a freshman. That 1966‚Äì67 freshman basketball team still holds the record for most wins by a freshman team at USU.Former Aggie Phil Olsen Is On College Football Hall Of Fame Ballot :: Announcement will be made on May 16 Olsen was inducted into the State of Utah's Sports Hall of Fame in 1985, and was a member of USU's All-Century Football Team.Utah State Official Athletic Site Inducted into the Utah State University Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2000, he was selected by Sports Illustrated as one of the State of Utah's Top 50 Athletes of the Century. From 2002‚Äì2019 he was a finalist for the College Football Hall of Fame. He was also named by Deseret News the 14th best football player to come out of the State of Utah.  NFL career  Olsen was drafted in the first round (overall #4) of the 1970 draft by the Boston Patriots. Prior to reporting to the Patriots, he suffered a severe knee injury in practice the week of the College All-Star game in Chicago, Illinois when defensive tackle Mike McCoy of the University of Notre Dame fell on his right knee, ending his 1970 season. Olsen was traded to the Rams before the 1971 season for a No. 1 draft choice and additional financial compensation. He suffered a second injury to the same knee after winning the starting position at right defensive tackle, but came back after five weeks to be the starter for the Rams in 1971 and 1972 next to his brother, Merlin Olsen. Merlin and Phil played side-by-side as defensive tackles for the Los Angeles Rams in 1971 and 1972, the only time in NFL history this has ever happened. A younger brother, Orrin, played for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1976. Merlin, Phil and Orrin were all playing in the NFL in 1976, which is one of the few times in NFL history that three brothers have ever played at the same time. In 1973 and 1974 Olsen was moved to defensive end where he backed up Fred Dryer and Jack Youngblood. He was traded to the Broncos in 1975, where he reunited with Coach John Ralston, who had recruited him out of high school to Stanford and had coached him in the East-West Shrine Game. Olsen switched positions again, this time to center, where he played through 1976. Olsen was the captain of the Broncos' return teams both seasons there. In 1976 Rick Upchurch had a spectacular year as a rookie kick returner. That year, the Broncos tied the then-NFL record with six kicks returned for touchdowns, with Upchurch setting the NFL mark for punt returns for a touchdown in a season with four. That same season, in addition to starting more than half the games at center, Olsen blocked four kicks (a punt, two PATs and a field goal). The Broncos beat the New York Giants 14‚Äì13 after Olsen blocked a PAT; for his efforts, he was presented with a game ball. He moved on to the Buffalo Bills to reunite with his Ram coach Chuck Knox as one of \\"Knox's Guys\\". These were players who Chuck Knox would bring into his teams to provide leadership, skill and experience. However, Olsen subsequently suffered a third knee injury and spent his time in Buffalo on the injured reserve unit, retiring shortly afterwards.

These measures were enacted by the former Confederate states at the turn of the 20th century. Efforts were made in Maryland, Kentucky and Oklahoma. Their actions were designed to thwart the objective of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1870, which sought to protect the suffrage of freedmen after the American Civil War.Michael Perman, Struggle for mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908 (U of North Carolina Press, 2003. During the later elections of Reconstruction era, beginning in the 1870s, white Democrats used violence by paramilitary groups (such as the Ku Klux Klan), as well as fraud, to suppress black Republican voters and turn Republicans out of office. After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. After achieving control of state legislatures, white Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disenfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many poor whites in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.Valelly, Richard M.; The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 134-139 In 1912, the Republican Party was split when Roosevelt ran against the party nominee, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disenfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected as the first southern President since 1856. He was re- elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt racial segregation throughout federal government workplaces, as well as racial discrimination in hiring. During World War I, American military forces were segregated, with black soldiers poorly trained and equipped. Disenfranchisement had far-reaching effects in Congress, where the Democratic Solid South enjoyed \\"about 25 extra seats in Congress for each decade between 1903 and 1953\\".Valelly; The Two Reconstructions; pp. 146-147 Also, the Democratic dominance in the South meant that southern Senators and Representatives became entrenched in Congress. They favored seniority privileges in Congress, which became the standard by 1920, and Southerners controlled chairmanships of important committees, as well as leadership of the national Democratic Party. During the Great Depression, legislation establishing numerous national social programs were passed without the representation of African Americans, leading to gaps in program coverage and discrimination against them in operations. In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from serving in local courts. Juries were all white across the South. Political disenfranchisement did not end until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional.North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Congressional Map Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.Is Partisan Gerrymandering Legal? Why the Courts Are Divided. Background The American Civil War ended in 1865, marking the start of the Reconstruction era in the eleven former Confederate states. Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts, starting in 1867, establishing military districts to oversee the affairs of these states pending reconstruction. During the Reconstruction era, blacks constituted absolute majorities of the populations in Mississippi and South Carolina, were equal to the white population in Louisiana, and represented more than 40 percent of the population in four other former Confederate states. In addition, the Reconstruction Acts and state Reconstruction constitutions and law barred many ex-Confederate Southern whites from holding office and, in some states, disenfranchised them unless they took take a loyalty oath. Southern whites, fearing black domination, resisted the freedmen's exercise of political power.Gabriel J. Chin & Randy Wagner, \\"The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty,\\" 43 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review 65 (2008) In 1867, black men voted for the first time. By the 1868 presidential election, Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia had still not been re-admitted to the Union. General Ulysses S. Grant was elected as president thanks in part to 700,000 black voters. In February 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified; it was designed to protect blacks' right to vote from infringement by the states. At the same time, by 1870 all Southern states had dropped enforcement of disenfranchisement of ex-Confederates with the exception of Arkansas, where disenfranchisement of ex-Confederates was dropped in the aftermath of the Brooks-Baxter War in 1874. White supremacist paramilitary organizations, allied with Southern Democrats, used intimidation, violence and even committed assassinations in order to repress blacks and prevent them from exercising their civil and political rights in elections from 1868 until the mid-1870s. The insurgent Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was formed in 1865 in Tennessee (as a backlash to defeat in the war) and it quickly became a powerful secret vigilante group, with chapters across the South. The Klan initiated a campaign of intimidation directed against blacks and sympathetic whites. Their violence included vandalism and destruction of property, physical attacks and assassinations, and lynchings. Teachers who came from the North to teach freedmen were sometimes attacked or intimidated as well. In 1870, the attempt of North Carolina's Republican Governor William W. Holden to suppress the Klan, known as the Kirk-Holden War, led to a backlash by whites, the election of a Democratic General Assembly in August 1870, and his impeachment and removal from office. The toll of Klan murders and attacks led Congress to pass laws to end the violence. In 1870, the strongly Republican Congress passed the Enforcement Acts, imposing penalties for conspiracy to deny black suffrage. The Acts empowered the President to deploy the armed forces to suppress organizations that deprived people of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Organizations whose members appeared in arms were considered in rebellion against the United States. The President could suspend habeas corpus under those circumstances. President Grant used these provisions in parts of the Carolinas in late 1871. United States marshals supervised state voter registrations and elections and could summon the help of military or naval forces if needed. These measures led to the demise of the first Klan by the early 1870s. New paramilitary groups quickly sprang up, as tens of thousands of veterans belonged to gun clubs and similar groups. A second wave of violence began, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, usually black or Republican. The Supreme Court ruled in 1876 in United States v. Cruikshank, arising from trials related to the Colfax Massacre, that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Enforcement Acts were intended to support, did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. They recommended that persons seek relief from state courts, which had not been supportive of freedmen's rights. The paramilitary organizations that arose in the mid to late 1870s were part of continuing insurgency in the South after the Civil War, as armed veterans in the South resisted social changes, and worked to prevent black Americans and other Republicans from voting and running for office. Such groups included the White League, formed in Louisiana in 1874 from white militias, with chapters forming in other Southern states; the Red Shirts, formed in 1875 in Mississippi but also active in North Carolina and South Carolina; and other \\"White Liners,\\" such as rifle clubs and the Knights of the White Camellia. Compared to the Klan, they were open societies, better organized and devoted to the political goal of regaining control of the state legislatures and suppressing Republicans, including most blacks. They often solicited newspaper coverage for publicity to increase their threat. The scale of operations was such that in 1876, North Carolina had 20,000 men in rifle clubs. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, a class that covered most adult men who could have fought in the war, the paramilitary groups worked for political aims: to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize freedmen to keep them away from the polls. Such groups have been described as \\"the military arm of the Democratic Party\\".George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132 They were instrumental in many Southern states in driving blacks away from the polls and ensuring a white Democratic takeover of legislatures and governorships in most Southern states in the 1870s, most notoriously during the controversial 1876 elections. As a result of a national Compromise of 1877 arising from the 1876 presidential election, the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South, formally ending the Reconstruction era. By that time, Southern Democrats had effectively regained control in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida ‚Äì they identified as the Redeemers. In the South, the process of white Democrats regaining control of state governments has been called \\"the Redemption\\". African-American historians sometimes call the Compromise of 1877 \\"The Great Betrayal\\". Post-Reconstruction disenfranchisement Following continuing violence around elections as insurgents worked to suppress black voting, the Democratic-dominated Southern states passed legislation to create barriers to voter registrations by blacks and poor whites, starting with the Georgia poll tax in 1877. Other measures followed, particularly near the end of the century, after a Republican- Populist alliance caused the Democrats to temporarily lose some Congressional seats and control of some gubernatorial positions. To secure their power, the Democrats worked to exclude blacks (and most Republicans) from politics. The results could be seen across the South. After Reconstruction, Tennessee initially had the most \\"consistently competitive political system in the South\\".J. Morgan Kousser, The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880‚Äì1910, p.104 A bitter election battle in 1888, marked by unmatched corruption and violence, resulted in white Democrats taking over the state legislature. To consolidate their power, they worked to suppress the black vote and sharply reduced it through changes in voter registration, requiring poll taxes, as well as changing election procedures to make voting more complex. In 1890, Mississippi adopted a new constitution, which contained provisions for voter registration which required voters pay poll taxes and pass a literacy test. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, and the two provisions effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a Supreme Court challenge in Williams v. Mississippi (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and what they called the \\"Mississippi plan\\". By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill.Richard H. Pildes, ‚ÄòDemocracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon‚Äô, Constitutional Commentary, Vol.17, 2000, Accessed 10 Mar 2008 Such constitutional provisions were unsuccessfully challenged at the Supreme Court in Giles v. Harris (1903). In practice, these provisions, including white primaries, created a maze that blocked most blacks and many poor whites from voting in Southern states until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', Constitutional Commentary, Vol.17, 2000, p. 10, Accessed 10 Mar 2008 Voter registration and turnout dropped sharply across the South, as most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system. Senator and former South Carolina Governor Benjamin Tillman defended this on the floor of the Senate: > In my State there were 135,000 negro voters, or negroes of voting age, and > some 90,000 or 95,000 white voters.... Now, I want to ask you, with a free > vote and a fair count, how are you going to beat 135,000 by 95,000? How are > you going to do it?

The disenfranchisement of a large proportion of voters attracted the attention of Congress, and as early as 1900 some members proposed stripping the South of seats, related to the number of people who were barred from voting. Apportionment of seats was still based on total population (with the assumption of the usual number of voting males in relation to the residents); as a result white Southerners commanded a number of seats far out of proportion to the voters they represented.‚ÄòCOMMITTEE AT ODDS ON REAPPORTIONMENT‚Äô, The New York Times, 20 Dec 1900, accessed 10 Mar 2008 In the end, Congress did not act on this issue, as the Southern bloc of Democrats had sufficient power to reject or stall such action. For decades, white Southern Democrats exercised Congressional representation derived from a full count of the population, but they disfranchised several million black and white citizens. Southern white Democrats comprised the \\"Solid South\\", a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the mid-20th century. Their representatives, re- elected repeatedly by one-party states, exercised the power of seniority, controlling numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses. Their power allowed them to have control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues, as well as to defeat bills to make lynching a federal crime. New state constitutions, 1890 to 1908 Despite white Southerners' complaints about Reconstruction, several Southern states kept most provisions of their Reconstruction constitutions for more than two decades, until late in the 19th century.W.E.B. DuBois, Black Reconstruction in America, 1868‚Äì1880, New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998 In some states, the number of blacks elected to local offices reached a peak in the 1880s although Reconstruction had ended. They had an influence at the local level, where much of government took place, although they did not win many statewide or national seats. Subsequently, state legislatures passed restrictive laws or constitutions that made voter registration and election rules more complicated. As literacy tests and other restrictions could be applied subjectively, these changes sharply limited the vote by most blacks and, often, many poor whites; voter rolls dropped across the South into the new century. Florida approved a new constitution in 1885 that included provisions for poll taxes as a prerequisite for voter registration and voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven Southern states rewrote their constitutions. All included provisions that effectively restricted voter registration and suffrage, including requirements for poll taxes, increased residency, and subjective literacy tests.Michael Perman.Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888‚Äì1908. Chapel Hill: North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction With educational improvements, blacks had markedly increased their rate of literacy. By 1891, their illiteracy had declined to 58 percent, whilst the rate of white illiteracy in the South at that time was 31 percent.1878‚Äì1895: Disenfranchisement (sic), Southern Education Foundation , accessed 16 Mar 2008 Some states used grandfather clauses to exempt white voters from literacy tests altogether. Other states required otherwise eligible black voters to meet literacy and knowledge requirements to the satisfaction of white registrars, who applied subjective judgment and, in the process, rejected most black voters. By 1900, the majority of blacks were literate, but even many of the best-educated of these men continued to \\"fail\\" the literacy tests administered by white registrars. The historian J. Morgan Kousser noted, \\"Within the Democratic party, the chief impetus for restriction came from the black belt members,\\" whom he identified as \\"always socioeconomically privileged.\\" In addition to wanting to affirm white supremacy, the planter and business elite were concerned about voting by lower-class and uneducated whites. Kousser found, \\"They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote.\\"J. Morgan Kousser.The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974 Perman noted the goals of disenfranchisement resulted from several factors. Competition between white elites and white lower classes, for example, and a desire to prevent alliances between lower-class white and black Americans, as had been seen in Populist-Republican alliances, led white Democratic legislators to restrict voter rolls. With the passage of new constitutions, Southern states adopted provisions that caused disenfranchisement of large portions of their populations by skirting US constitutional protections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. While their voter registration requirements applied to all citizens, in practice they disenfranchised most blacks. As in Alabama, they also \\"would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well ‚Äì and that would ensure one-party Democratic rules through most of the 20th century in the South\\".Glenn Feldman, The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp. 135‚Äì136 The new provisions of the state constitutions almost entirely eliminated black voting. Although nothing approaching precise data exists, it is estimated that in the late 1930s less than one percent of blacks in the Deep South and around five percent in the Rim South were registered to vote,Mickey, Robert; Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972, p. 87 and that the proportion actually voting even in general elections, which were of no consequence due to complete Democratic dominance, was much smaller still. Secondly, the Democratic legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to assert white supremacy, establish racial segregation in public facilities, and treat blacks as second- class citizens. The landmark court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) held that \\"separate but equal\\" facilities, as on railroad cars, were constitutional. The new constitutions passed numerous Supreme Court challenges. In cases where a particular restriction was overruled by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century, states quickly devised new methods of excluding most blacks from voting, such as the white primary. Democratic Party primaries became the only competitive contests in southern states. For the national Democratic Party, the alignment after Reconstruction resulted in a powerful Southern region that was useful for congressional clout. Nevertheless, prior to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the \\"Solid South\\" inhibited the national party from fulfilling center-left initiatives desired since the days of William Jennings Bryan. Woodrow Wilson, one of two Democrats elected to the presidency between Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, was the first Southerner elected after 1856. He benefited by the disenfranchisement of blacks and crippling of the Republican Party in the South. Soon after taking office, Wilson directed the segregation of federal facilities in the District of Columbia, which had been integrated during Reconstruction.

Louisiana State legislators passed a new constitution in 1898 that included requirements for applicants to pass a literacy test in English or his native language in order to register to vote, or to certify owning $300 worth of property, known as a property requirement. The literacy test was administered by the voting registrar; in practice, they were white Democrats. Provisions in the constitution also included a grandfather clause, which provided a loophole to enable illiterate whites to register to vote. It said that \\"Any citizen who was a voter on January 1, 1867, or his son or grandson, or any person naturalized prior to January 1, 1898, if applying for registration before September 1, 1898, might vote, notwithstanding illiteracy or poverty.\\" Separate registration lists were kept for whites and blacks, making it easy for white registrars to discriminate against blacks in literacy tests. The constitution of 1898 also required a person to satisfy a longer residency requirement in the state, county, parish, and precinct before voting than did the constitution of 1879. This worked against the lower classes, who were more likely to move frequently for work, especially in agricultural areas where there were many migrant workers and sharecroppers. The effect of these changes on the population of black voters in Louisiana was devastating; by 1900 black voters were reduced from 130,334 to 5,320 on the rolls. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. \\"In 27 of the state's sixty parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in nine more parishes, only one black voter was.\\" =North Carolina= In 1894, a coalition of Republicans and the Populist Party won control of the North Carolina state legislature (and with it, the ability to elect two US Senators) and were successful in electing several US Representatives elected through electoral fusion. The fusion coalition made impressive gains in the 1896 election when their legislative majority expanded. Republican Daniel Lindsay Russell won the gubernatorial race in 1897, the first Republican governor of the state since the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The election also resulted in more than 1,000 elected or appointed black officials, including the election in 1897 of George Henry White to Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives. At the 1898 election, the Democrats ran on White Supremacy and disenfranchisement in a bitter race-baiting campaign led by Furnifold McLendel Simmons and Josephus Daniels, editor and publisher of The Raleigh News & Observer. The Republican/Populist coalition disintegrated, and the Democrats won the North Carolina 1898 election and the following 1900 election. Simmons was elected as the state's US senator in 1900, holding office until 1931 through multiple re-elections by the state legislature and by popular vote after 1920. The Democrats used their power in the state legislature to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again. They passed laws restricting voter registration. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration, and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied) and prepayment of a poll tax. A grandfather clause exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867. The legislature also passed Jim Crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities and transportation. The effect in North Carolina was the complete elimination of black voters from voter rolls by 1904. Contemporary accounts estimated that seventy-five thousand black male citizens lost the vote.Albert Shaw, The American Monthly Review of Reviews, Vol.XXII, Jul-Dec 1900, p.274Richard H. Pildes, ‚ÄòDemocracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon‚Äô, Constitutional Commentary, Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12-13 In 1900 blacks numbered 630,207 citizens, about 33% of the state's total population.Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia , accessed 15 Mar 2008 The growth of the thriving black middle class was slowed. In North Carolina and other Southern states, there were also the insidious effects of invisibility: \\"[W]ithin a decade of disenfranchisement (sic), the white supremacy campaign had erased the image of the black middle class from the minds of white North Carolinians.\\"Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', 2000, p.12 and 27, Accessed 10 Mar 2008 =Virginia= In Virginia, Democrats sought disenfranchisement in the late 19th century after a coalition of white and black Republicans with populist Democrats had come to power; the coalition had been formalized as the Readjuster Party. The Readjuster Party held control from 1881 to 1883, electing a governor and controlling the legislature, which also elected a US Senator from the state. As in North Carolina, state Democrats were able to divide Readjuster supporters through appeals to White Supremacy. After regaining power, Democrats changed state laws and the constitution in 1902 to disenfranchise blacks. They ratified the new constitution in the legislature and did not submit it to popular vote. Voting in Virginia fell by nearly half as a result of the disenfranchisement of blacks. The eighty-year stretch of white Democratic control ended only in the late 1960s after passage and enforcement of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the collapse of the Byrd Organization machine. =Border States: failed disenfranchisement= The five border states of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had legacies similar to the Confederate slave states from the Civil War. The Border States, all slave states, also established laws requiring racial segregation between the 1880s and 1900s; however, disenfranchisement of blacks was never attained to any significant degree. Most Border States did attempt such disenfranchisement during the 1900s. The causes of failure to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites in the Border States, as compared to their success for well over half a century in former Confederate states, were complicated. During the 1900s Maryland was vigorously divided between supporters and opponents of disenfranchisement, but it had a large and increasingly educated black community concentrated in Baltimore. This city had many free blacks before the Civil War and they had established both economic and political power.Smith, C. Fraser; Here Lies Jim Crow: Civil Rights in Maryland; p. 66 The state legislature passed a poll tax in 1904, but incurred vigorous opposition and repealed it in 1911. Despite support among conservative whites in the conservative Eastern Shore, referenda for bills to disenfranchise blacks failed three times in 1905, 1908 and 1910, with the last vote being the most decisive. The existence of substantial Italian immigration completely absent from the Confederacy meant that these immigrants were exposed to the possibility of disfranchisement, but much more critically allowed for much stronger resistance amongst the white population.Shufelt, Gordeon H.; 'Jim Crow among strangers: The growth of Baltimore's Little Italy and Maryland's disfranchisement campaigns'; Journal of American Ethnic History; vol. 19, issue 4 (Summer 2000), pp. 49-78 In Kentucky, Lexington's city government had passed a poll tax in 1901, but it was declared invalid in state circuit courts.Klotter, Jeames C.; Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox, 1900-1950; pp. 196-197 Six years later, a new state legislative effort to disenfranchise blacks failed because of the strong organization of the Republican Party in pro-Union regions of the state. Methods of disenfranchisement =Poll taxes= Proof of payment of a poll tax was a prerequisite to voter registration in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia (1877), North and South Carolina, Virginia (until 1882 and again from 1902 with its new constitution), Texas (1902)\\"Historical Barriers to Voting\\", in Texas Politics, University of Texas, accessed 4 November 2012. and in some northern and western states. The Texas poll tax \\"required otherwise eligible voters to pay between $1.50 and $1.75 to register to vote ‚Äì a lot of money at the time, and a big barrier to the working classes and poor\\". Georgia created a cumulative poll tax requirement in 1877: men of any race 21 to 60 years of age had to pay a sum of money for every year from the time they had turned 21, or from the time that the law took effect. The poll tax requirements applied to whites as well as blacks, and also adversely affected poor citizens. Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with other complex record-keeping requirements. These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently. The poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of grandfather clause, North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks in the State, who did not have suffrage before that date. =Educational and character requirements= Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, created an educational requirement, with review by a local registrar of a voter's qualifications. In 1898 Georgia rejected such a device. Alabama delegates at first hesitated, out of concern that illiterate whites would lose their votes. After the legislature stated that the new constitution would not disenfranchise any white voters and that it would be submitted to the people for ratification, Alabama passed an educational requirement. It was ratified at the polls in November 1901. Its distinctive feature was the \\"good character clause\\" (also known as the \\"grandfather clause\\"). An appointment board in each county could register \\"all voters under the present [previous] law\\" who were veterans or the lawful descendants of such, and \\"all who are of good character and understand the duties and obligations of citizenship\\". This gave the board discretion to approve voters on a case-by-case basis. In practice, they enfranchised many whites, but rejected both poor whites and blacks. Most of the latter had been slaves and unable to attain military service. South Carolina, Louisiana (1889), and later, Virginia incorporated an educational requirement in their new constitutions. In 1902 Virginia adopted a constitution with the \\"understanding\\" clause as a literacy test to use until 1904. In addition, application for registration had to be in the applicant's handwriting and written in the presence of the registrar. Thus, someone who could not write, could not vote. =Eight Box Law= By 1882, the Democrats were firmly in power in South Carolina. Republican voters were mostly limited to the majority-black counties of Beaufort and Georgetown. Because the state had a large black-majority population (nearly sixty percent in 1890), white Democrats had narrow margins in many counties and feared a possible resurgence of black Republican voters at the polls. To remove the black threat, the General Assembly created an indirect literacy test, called the \\"Eight Box Law\\". The law required a separate box for ballots for each office; a voter had to insert the ballot into the corresponding box or it would not count. The ballots could not have party symbols on them. They had to be of a correct size and type of paper. Many ballots were arbitrarily rejected because they slightly deviated from the requirements. Ballots could also randomly be rejected if there were more ballots in a box than registered voters. The multiple-ballot box law was challenged in court. On May 8, 1895, Judge Goff of the United States Circuit Court declared the provision unconstitutional and enjoined the state from taking further action under it. But in June 1895, the US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Goff and dissolved the injunction, leaving the way open for a convention. The constitutional convention met on September 10 and adjourned on December 4, 1895. By the new constitution, South Carolina adopted the Mississippi Plan until January 1, 1898. Any male citizen could be registered who was able to read a section of the constitution or to satisfy the election officer that he understood it when read to him. Those thus registered were to remain voters for life. Under the new constitution and application of literacy practices, black voters were dropped in great number from the registration rolls: by 1896, in a state where according to the 1890 census blacks numbered 728,934 and comprised nearly sixty percent of the total population, only 5,500 black voters had succeeded in registering.Richard H. Pildes, \\"Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\\", 2000, p.12, accessed 10 Mar 2008 =Grandfather clause= States also used grandfather clauses to enable illiterate whites who could not pass a literacy test to vote. It allowed a man to vote if his grandfather or father had voted prior to January 1, 1867; at that time, most African Americans had been slaves, while free people of color, even if property owners, and freedmen were ineligible to vote until 1870. Justice Benjamin Curtis' dissent in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857) had noted that free people of color in numerous states had the right to vote at the time of the Articles of Confederation (as part of the argument about whether people of African descent could be citizens of the new United States): > Of this, there can be no doubt. At the time of the ratification of the > Articles of Confederation, all free native-born inhabitants of the States of > New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina, > though descended from African slaves, were not only citizens of those > States, but such of them as had the other necessary qualifications possessed > the franchise of electors, on equal terms with other citizens. North Carolina's constitutional amendment of 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867, another type of use of a grandfather clause.Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', 2000, pp.12 and 27 Accessed 10 Mar 2008 Virginia also used a type of grandfather clause. In Guinn v. United States (1915), the Supreme Court invalidated the Oklahoma Constitution's \\"old soldier\\" and \\"grandfather clause\\" exemptions from literacy tests. In practice, these had disenfranchised blacks, as had occurred in numerous Southern states. This decision affected similar provisions in the constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia election rules. Oklahoma and other states quickly reacted by passing laws that created other rules for voter registration that worked against blacks and minorities.Richard M. Valelly, The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004, p.141 Guinn was the first of many cases in which the NAACP filed a brief challenging discriminatory electoral rules. In Lane v. Wilson (1939), the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma provision designed to disenfranchise blacks. It had replaced the clause struck down in Guinn. This clause permanently disenfranchised everyone qualified to vote who had not registered to vote in a twelve-day window between April 30 and May 11, 1916, except for those who had voted in 1914. While designed to be more resistant to challenges based on discrimination, as the law did not specifically mention race, the Court struck it down partially because it relied on the 1914 election, when voters had been discriminated against under the rule invalidated in Guinn. =White primaries= About the turn of the 20th century, white members of the Democratic Party in some Southern states devised rules that excluded blacks and other minorities from participating in party primaries. These became common for all elections. As the Democratic Party was dominant and the only competitive voting was in the primaries, barring minority voters from the primaries was another means of excluding them from politics. Court challenges overturned the white primary system, but many states then passed laws that authorized political parties to set up the rules for their own systems, such as the white primary. Texas, for instance, passed such a state law in 1923. It was used to bar Mexican Americans as well as black Americans from voting; it survived challenges to the US Supreme Court until the 1940s.Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting, accessed 11 Apr 2008 Congressional response The North had heard the South's version of Reconstruction abuses, such as financial corruption, high taxes, and incompetent freedmen. Industry wanted to invest in the South and not worry about political problems. In addition, reconciliation between white veterans of the North and South reached a peak in the early 20th century. As historian David Blight demonstrated in Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, reconciliation meant the pushing aside by whites of the major issues of race and suffrage. Southern whites were effective for many years at having their version of history accepted, especially as it was confirmed in ensuing decades by influential historians of the Dunning School at Columbia University and other institutions. Disfranchisement of black Americans in the South was covered by national newspapers and magazines as new laws and constitutions were created, and many Northerners were outraged and alarmed. The Lodge Bill or Federal Elections Bill or Lodge Force Bill of 1890 was a bill drafted by Representative Henry Cabot Lodge (R) of Massachusetts, and sponsored in the Senate by George Frisbie Hoar. It would have authorized federal electors to supervise elections under certain conditions. Due to a Senate filibuster, as well as trade-off of support with Democrats by western Silver Republicans, the bill failed to pass.Keyssar, Alexander ; The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States, Basic Books, 2000/2009, p. 86 Wendy Hazard, 'Thomas Brackett Reed, Civil Rights, and the Fight for Fair Elections,' Maine History, March 2004, Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp 1‚Äì23 In 1900 the Committee of Census of Congress considered proposals for adding more seats to the House of Representatives because of increased population. Proposals ranged for a total number of seats from 357 to 386. Edgar D. Crumpacker (R-IN) filed an independent report urging that the Southern states be stripped of seats due to the large numbers of voters they had disfranchised. He noted this was provided for in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provided for stripping representation from states that reduced suffrage due to race. The Committee and House failed to agree on this proposal. Supporters of black suffrage worked to secure Congressional investigation of disfranchisement, but concerted opposition of the Southern Democratic bloc was aroused, and the efforts failed. From 1896 to 1900, the House of Representatives with a Republican majority had acted in more than thirty cases to set aside election results from Southern states where the House Elections Committee had concluded that \\"black voters had been excluded due to fraud, violence, or intimidation.\\" Nevertheless, in the early 20th century, it began to back off from its enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment and suggested that state and federal courts should exercise oversight of this issue. The Southern bloc of Democrats exercised increasing power in the House.Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti- Democracy, and the Canon', Constitutional Commentary, Vol. 17, 2000, pp.19-20, Accessed 10 Mar 2008 They had no interest in protecting suffrage for blacks. In 1904 Congress administered a coup de gr√¢ce to efforts to investigate disfranchisement in its decision in the 1904 South Carolina election challenge of Dantzler v. Lever. The House Committee on Elections upheld Lever's victory. It suggested that citizens of South Carolina who believed their rights were denied should take their cases to the state courts, and ultimately, the US Supreme Court.Richard H. Pildes, ‚ÄòDemocracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon‚Äô, Constitutional Commentary, Vol. 17, 2000, pp.20-21 Accessed 10 Mar 2008 Blacks had no recourse through the Southern state courts, which would not uphold their rights. Because they were disfranchised, blacks could not serve on juries, and whites were clearly aligned against them on this and other racial issues. Despite the Lever decision and domination of Congress by Democrats, some Northern Congressmen continued to raise the issue of black disfranchisement and resulting malapportionment. For instance, on December 6, 1920, Representative George H. Tinkham (R-MA) offered a resolution for the Committee of Census to investigate alleged disfranchisement of blacks. His intention was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. In addition, he believed there should be reapportionment in the House related to the voting population of southern states, rather than the general population as enumerated in the census. Such reapportionment was authorized by the Constitution and would reflect reality, so that the South should not get credit for people and voters it had disfranchised. Tinkham detailed how outsized the South's representation was related to the total number of voters in each state, compared to other states with the same number of representatives: * States with four representatives: :Florida, with a total vote of 31,613. :Colorado, with a total vote of 208,855. :Maine, with a total vote of 121,836. * States with six representatives: :Nebraska, with a total vote of 216,014. :West Virginia, with a total vote of 211,643. * South Carolina, given seven representatives because of its total population (which was majority black), counted only 25,433 voters. * States with eight representatives: :Louisiana, with a total vote of 44,794. :Kansas, with a total vote of 425,641. * States with ten representatives: :Alabama, with a total vote of 62,345. :Minnesota, with a total vote of 299,127. :Iowa, with a total vote of 316,377. * California, with eleven representatives, had a total vote of 644,790. * States with twelve representatives: :Georgia, with a total vote of 59,196. :New Jersey, with a total vote of 338,461. * Indiana, with thirteen representatives, had a total vote of 565,216. Tinkham was defeated by the Democratic Southern Bloc, and also by fears amongst the northern business elites of increasing the voting power of Northern urban working classes,Smith, J. Douglas; On Democracy's Doorstep: The Inside Story of How the Supreme Court Brought \\"One Person, One Vote\\" to the United States; pp. 4-18 whom both northern business and Southern planter elites believed would vote for large- scale income redistribution at a Federal level.See Rodden, Jonathan A.; ‚ÄòThe Long Shadow of the Industrial Revolution: Political Geography and the Representation of the Left‚Äô After Herbert Hoover was elected in a landslide in 1928, gaining support from five southern states, Tinkham renewed his effort in the spring of 1929 to persuade Congress to penalize southern states under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments for their racial discrimination. He suggested reduction of their congressional delegations in proportion to the populations they had disenfranchised. He was defeated again by the Solid South. Its representatives had rallied in outrage that the First Lady had invited Jessie De Priest for tea to the White House with other congressional wives. She was the wife of Oscar Stanton De Priest from Chicago, the first African-American elected to Congress in the 20th century. Segregation of the federal service began under President Woodrow Wilson, ignoring complaints by the NAACP, which had supported his election in 1912.August Meier, August, and Elliott Rudwick. 'The Rise of Segregation in the Federal Bureaucracy, 1900‚Äì1930.' Phylon (1960) 28.2 (1967): 178-184. in JSTOR The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for W.E.B. Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical. In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film Birth of a Nation, a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan and shown in the Wilson White House as a personal favor to its author, a college roommate of President Wilson. Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open. Legislative and cultural effects =20th-century Supreme Court decisions= Black Americans and their allies worked hard to regain their ability to exercise the constitutional rights of citizens. Booker T. Washington, widely known for his accommodationist approach as the leader of the Tuskegee Institute, called on northern backers to help finance legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation. He raised substantial funds and also arranged for representation on some cases, such as the two for Giles in Alabama. He challenged the state's grandfather clause and a citizenship test required for new voters, which was administered in a discriminatory way against blacks.Richard H. Pildes, ‚ÄòDemocracy, Anti- Democracy, and the Canon‚Äô, Constitutional Commentary, Vol. 17, 2000, p. 21 Accessed 10 Mar 2008 In its ruling in Giles v. Harris (1903), the United States Supreme Court under Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. effectively upheld such southern voter registration provisions in dealing with a challenge to the Alabama constitution. Its decision said the provisions were not targeted at blacks and thus did not deprive them of rights. This has been characterized as the \\"most momentous ignored decision\\" in constitutional history.Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', Constitutional Commentary, Vol. 17, 2000, p.32 Accessed 10 Mar 2008 Trying to deal with the grounds of the Court's ruling, Giles mounted another challenge. In Giles v. Teasley (1904), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama's disenfranchising constitution. That same year the Congress refused to overturn a disputed election, and essentially sent plaintiffs back to the state courts. Even when black plaintiffs gained rulings in their favor from the Supreme Court, states quickly devised alternative ways to exclude them from the political process. It was not until later in the 20th century that such legal challenges on disenfranchisement began to meet more success in the courts. With the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909, the interracial group based in New York began to provide financial and strategic support to lawsuits on voting issues. What became the NAACP Legal Defense Fund organized and mounted numerous cases in repeated court and legal challenges to the many barriers of segregation, including disenfranchisement provisions of the states. The NAACP often represented plaintiffs directly, or helped raise funds to support legal challenges. The NAACP also worked at public education, lobbying of Congress, demonstrations, and encouragement of theater and academic writing as other means to reach the public. NAACP chapters were organized in cities across the country, and membership increased rapidly in the South. The American Civil Liberties Union also represented plaintiffs in some disenfranchisement cases. =Successful challenges= In Smith v. Allwright (1944), the Supreme Court reviewed a Texas case and ruled against the white primary; the state legislature had authorized the Democratic Party to devise its own rules of operation. The 1944 court ruling was that this was unconstitutional, as the state had failed to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens. Following the 1944 ruling, civil rights organizations in major cities moved quickly to register black voters. For instance, in Georgia, in 1940 only 20,000 blacks had managed to register to vote. After the Supreme Court decision, the All-Citizens Registration Committee (ACRC) of Atlanta started organizing. By 1947 they and others had succeeded in getting 125,000 black Americans registered, 18.8 percent of those of eligible age.Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, p.70 Over the South as a whole, black voter registration steadily increased from less than 3 percent in 1940 to 29 percent in 1960 and over 40 percent in 1964.Beyerlein, Kraig and Andrews, Kenneth T.; ‚ÄòBlack Voting during the Civil Rights Movement: A Micro-Level Analysis‚Äô; Social Forces, volume 87, No. 1 (September 2008), pp. 65-93 Nevertheless, gains even in 1964 were minimal in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana outside Acadiana and southern parts of Georgia, and were limited in most other rural areas.See Subcommittee No. 5; Committee on the Judiciary. House of Representatives; 1965 Voting Rights Act, p. 4 Each legal victory was followed by white-dominated legislatures' renewed efforts to control black voting through different exclusionary schemes. In the 1940s, Alabama passed a law to give white registrars more discretion in testing applicants for comprehension and literacy. In 1958 Georgia passed a new voter registration act that required those who were illiterate to satisfy \\"understanding tests\\" by correctly answering 20 of 30 questions related to citizenship posed by the voting registrar. Blacks had made substantial advances in education, but the individual white registrars were the sole persons to determine whether individual prospective voters answered correctly. In practice, registrars disqualified most black voters, whether they were educated or not. In Terrell County, for instance, which was 64% black in population, after passage of the act, only 48 black Americans were able to register to vote in 1958.Davidson and Grofman (1994), Quiet Revolution in the South, p. 71 Civil Rights Movement The NAACP's steady progress with individual cases was thwarted by southern Democrats' continuing resistance and passage of new statutory barriers to blacks' exercising the franchise. Through the 1950s and 1960s, private citizens enlarged the effort by becoming activists throughout the South, led by many black churches and their leaders, and joined by both young and older activists from northern states. Nonviolent confrontation and demonstrations were mounted in numerous Southern cities, often provoking violent reaction by white bystanders and authorities. The moral crusade of the Civil Rights Movement gained national media coverage, attention across the country, and a growing national demand for change. Widespread violence against the Freedom Riders in 1961, which was covered by television and newspapers, the murders of activists in Alabama in 1963 gained support for the activists' cause at the national level. President John F. Kennedy introduced civil rights legislation to Congress in 1963 before he was assassinated. President Lyndon B. Johnson took up the charge. In January 1964, Johnson met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first State of the Union address, Johnson asked Congress to \\"let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined.\\" On January 23, 1964, the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting the use of poll taxes in national elections, was ratified with the approval of South Dakota, the 38th state to do so. On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Chaney, disappeared in Neshoba County, Mississippi. The three were volunteers aiding in the registration of black voters as part of the Mississippi Freedom Summer Project. Forty-four days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered their bodies from an earthen dam where they were buried. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff Cecil Price and 16 others, all Ku Klux Klan members, were indicted for the murders; seven were convicted. The investigation also revealed the bodies of several black men, whose deaths had never been revealed or prosecuted by white law enforcement officials. When the Civil Rights Bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \\"Southern Bloc\\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator, led by Richard Russell (D-GA), launched a filibuster to prevent its passage. Russell said: After 57 working days of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) to end the debate and the filibuster. It was the first time that Southern senators had failed to win with such tactics against civil rights bills. On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act prohibited segregation in public places and barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. It did not explicitly ban literacy tests, which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters. As the United States Department of Justice has stated: > By 1965 concerted efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement > (sic) had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success > overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual. The murder > of voting-rights activists in Philadelphia, Mississippi, gained national > attention, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism. > Finally, the unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965, by state troopers on > peaceful marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, en > route to the state capitol in Montgomery, persuaded the President and > Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting > rights legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting > rights law and hearings began soon thereafter on the bill that would become > the Voting Rights Act. Passed in 1965, this law prohibited the use of literacy tests as a requirement to register to vote. It provided for recourse for local voters to federal oversight and intervention, plus federal monitoring of areas that historically had low voter turnouts to ensure that new measures were not taken against minority voters. It provided for federal enforcement of voting rights. African Americans began to enter the formal political process, most in the South for the first time in their lives. They have since won numerous seats and offices at local, state and federal levels.

Founded in 1897, Memorial Medical Center is one of two hospitals in the Springfield metropolitan area. It also is home to the Memorial Center for Learning and Innovation, a 72,000 square foot educational learning center. MMC is accredited by The Joint Commission and is recognized as a Magnet hospital. In 2016, the hospital was the first within Illinois to be awarded the AHA-McKesson Quest for Quality for leadership and innovation in quality improvement and safety in patient care by the American Hospital Association. In the year 2015, Memorial Medical Center had 24,469 admissions, 65,821 emergency department visits, and 19,973 surgical procedures. The Echocardiography and Vascular labs are Intersocietal Accreditation Commission accredited. Inpatient rehabilitation programs at the hospital are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). Memorial Medical Center has been a teaching hospital affiliated with Southern Illinois University School of Medicine since 1970 in order to provide training for medical residents. UIC College of Nursing, Benedictine University, Lincoln Land Community College, and other educational institutions teach nursing education programs at the hospital. History The hospital originally opened on April 19, 1897, as Springfield Hospital and Training School with twelve patient beds at the corner of Fifth Street and North Grand Avenue. The original hospital was affiliated with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, but in 1931 the church broke ties with the hospital. In 1941, the hospital was renamed to Memorial Hospital. A new building was erected in 1943 at its current campus location at First and Miller Streets with a patient capacity of 270. The first kidney transplant in Springfield occurred at the hospital on October 21, 1970. The procedure lasted for five hours and the patient previously had a heart valve replaced just under nine months earlier. In 1974, the hospital was renamed to its current name, Memorial Medical Center.

He played a major role in the 1796 Italian campaign during the French Revolutionary Wars, leading corps-sized commands in the fighting against the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte. He led troops during the Napoleonic Wars and was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment. Early career Born in Buda (Ofen) (in modern-day Budapest, Hungary) in 1737, Davidovich came from a Serb family which had immigrated to the Austrian Empire from the Ottoman Empire at the time of Emperor Leopold I. In 1757, Davidovich joined the Austrian army's Ferdinand Karl Infantry Regiment #2. He served during the Seven Years' War and rose in rank to Captain. In 1771, he received promotion to Major in d'Alton Infantry Regiment #19. He performed heroically under fire at Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka (Habelschwerdt) in January 1779 during the War of the Bavarian Succession. This action earned him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. He was rewarded with the noble rank of Freiherr in 1780. The following year, he became Oberst-Leutnant of the Esterhazy Infantry Regiment #34. He earned promotion to Oberst (colonel) of the Peterwardeiner Grenz infantry regiment in 1783. During the Austro-Turkish War, Davidovich talked the Turkish governor of ≈†abac into surrendering in 1788. He assisted Maximilian Baillet de Latour in stamping out the 1789 Belgian revolt and was elevated to the rank of General-Major in 1790. French Revolutionary Wars In 1793 during the War of the First Coalition, he distinguished himself in the battles of Neerwinden and Wattignies.German Wikipedia Pavle Davidoviƒá He participated in the Flanders campaign in 1794 under Prince Josias of Saxe- Coburg-Saalfeld. He served under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser in the successful Siege of Mannheim which capitulated on 22 November 1795. He was promoted to Feldmarschal-Leutnant in March 1796. During the spring of 1796, Napoleon's French army overran the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and the Duchy of Milan, and began the Siege of Mantua. In July, Davidovich transferred to the Italian theater and was placed under Wurmser's command. During the first relief of Mantua, he commanded the Left-Center (III) Column, which included the brigades of Anton Mittrowsky, Anton Lipthay, and Leberecht Spiegel. The force numbered 8,274 infantry, 1,618 cavalry, and 40 cannon. He fought at the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August. In the second relief of Mantua, Wurmser and his chief-of-staff Franz von Lauer planned to transfer major elements of the army from the upper Adige valley to Bassano del Grappa via the Brenta valley. They assigned Davidovich to hold the Adige valley with 13,500 soldiers in the brigades of the Prince of Reuss, Josef Vukassovich, and Johann Sporck. Lauer believed that the French army would remain passive during the operation. Defying expectations, Bonaparte attacked Davidovich with 30,000 men. In the Battle of Rovereto on 4 September, the French swamped the Austrian defenses, inflicted 3,000 casualties, captured Trento, and pushed Davidovich north beyond Lavis. Bonaparte soon won the Battle of Bassano and drove Wurmser and 12,000 men within the fortress of Mantua. For the third relief of Mantua, Emperor Francis II appointed J√≥zsef Alvinczi commander of a newly formed army. Alvinczi planned to advance on Mantua from the east with 28,000 soldiers while Davidovich and 19,500 troops moved from the Adige valley in the north. Davidovich's Tyrol Corps comprised the brigades of Sporck, Vukassovich, Johann Laudon, and Joseph Ocskay, plus a small reserve. After a bloody clash at Cembra on 2 November, he recaptured Trento. He routed Claude Vaubois' outnumbered French division at the Battle of Calliano on 7 November. Despite being urged by Alvinczi to attack again, he proved very slow to follow up his success. One reason was the 3,500 casualties suffered at Cembra and Calliano. Other difficulties included a false report that placed Andr√© Mass√©na's division in his front, heavy snow in the mountains, and the fact that messages took two days to arrive from Alvinczi. He routed Vaubois again at Rivoli Veronese on 17 November, but this victory came two days too late. After the French defeated Alvinczi on 15‚Äì17 November at the Battle of Arcole, Bonaparte turned on Davidovich in great strength. The French beat him in a second clash at Rivoli on 22 November. With Davidovich's corps in flight northward, Alvinczi was forced to abandon the campaign. Napoleonic Wars In 1804, he became the proprietor of Davidovich Infantry Regiment #34, a Hungarian unit, and held this position until his death. When the War of the Third Coalition broke out, he commanded part of Archduke Charles' army in Italy. During the Battle of Caldiero on 29‚Äì31 October 1805, he led the nine infantry battalions, eight cavalry squadrons, and 26 artillery pieces of the left wing. After the war, he served as deputy (Adlatus) to the commanding general in Slavonia. He inspected fortresses in Serbia and received promotion to Feldzeugmeister in 1807. In his last active command, he led a division of Hungarian insurrection militia at the Battle of Raab on 14 June 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition. He died on 18 February 1814 at Kom√°rno when he was governor of that fortress. Notes References *.  * Further reading * Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966.

It was this climate that led to the rapid changes and quick questioning of thousand year old traditions. The abolition of the empire had an immediate effect on dress and customs: the largely Han population immediately cut off the queues that they had been forced to grow in submission to the overthrown Manchus whom they considered alien barbarian invaders. Sun Yat-sen popularized a new style of men's wear, featuring jacket and trousers instead of the pre-existing robes. Adapted from Japanese student wear, this style of dress became known as the Zhongshan suit (Zhongshan being Sun Yat-sen's given name in Chinese). Later, Mao Zedong's variant of the Zhongshan suit would become well known in the West as the Mao suit. Meanwhile, Madame Sun popularised the qipao as the standard female dress. At the same time, old practices such as footbinding, which Chinese had long known was viewed as backwards and unmodern by Westerners, were forbidden. In the late 1910s and early 1920s, students and intellectuals began to challenge old customs in what became the New Cultural Movement. The era called for iconoclasm, the assertion of individuality, and the liberalization of society (such as through the abolition of arranged marriages). Universities began to incorporate western subjects into the curriculum and discussion of numerous philosophies such as communism and anarchism ensued. Notably, Lu Xun published his satire Diary of a Madman to challenge Confucianism, Ba Jin questioned the hierarchical family structure, and Hu Shih called for writing in Vernacular Chinese instead of Literary Chinese for mass appeal. The literary journal New Youth, edited by Chen Duxiu, promoted science and democracy. These changes, though affecting urban and upper class society, failed to reach the peasantry who remained mostly illiterate. Economic equality and gender equality became great concerns among intellectuals, students, and the general public. With the movement of people towards cities also came concern for such issues. Many young intellectuals became interested in communism and liberalism. In the 1930s, Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement to promote traditional Confucian social ethics, while rejecting individualism and Western capitalistic values. It also aimed to build up morale in a nation that was besieged with corruption, factionalism, and opium addiction. Some goals included courtesy to neighbors, following rules set by the government, keeping streets clean, and conserving energy. Literature Revolution The literature revolution (the vernacular language movement) happened in the late 1910 in China. It is the form of written Chinese based on the varieties of Chinese spoken throughout China. This was in contrast to Classical Chinese which was the written standard used during Imperial China up to the early twentieth century. It was encouraged to display a general dissatisfaction with the programmatic character and the tendency toward uniformity of some of the new literature. It was this movement that breathe the new style into the world of thought in China and build the basic of concept of the May Fourth Movement. Since the early 1920s, this modern vernacular form has been the standard style of writing for all speakers of all varieties of Chinese throughout mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore as well as Taiwan as the written form of modern standard Chinese which is commonly referred to the \\"Standard Written Chinese\\" or \\"Modern Written Chinese\\". \\"The centuries-old three-way opposition between classical written Chinese, vernacular written Chinese, and vernacular spoken Chinese represents an instance of diglossia.\\" =May Fourth Literature= The May Fourth Movement was an anti-imperialist, cultural, and political movement growing out of student participants in Beijing on 4 May 1919. Mainly university and high school students began the protest against the Chinese government's response to the [Treaty of Versailles] which allowed Japan to have territories in Shandong. The students were joined by others in the capital. The Chinese government and people had contributed to the Allied cause and expected the German Empire controlled areas of Shandong, especially the port of Tsingdao, to be returned to Chinese sovereignty given Germany's defeat by the Allied Powers. The Chinese diplomats at the Versailles Treaty appeared to have failed the popular will of the Chinese people since the Allied powers ignored them and allowed Japan to lay claim to German 'possessions' in China. Demonstrations accelerated against Japan and the outsider influence in China and gave new energy to the New Culture Movement. Dubbed the May Fourth movement, the next few years saw an upsurge of Chinese nationalism: a shift towards political mobilization and away from cultural activities, and a move towards populism rather than politics led by intellectual elites. As a result, many political and social leaders of the next revolutionary decades in China emerged. = Literature of the Thirties (1927-1937) = This period is also included in 'May Fourth literature (Wusi wenxue)'. Most Chinese and Japanese scholars agreed that the young style of May Fourth period had declined by the late 1920s. Then it was replaced by 'mature' phase of literary creativity in the 1930s. The term 'literature in the thirty' are broadly referred to work published in the decade from 1927 to 1937. The literature of the thirties is a crucial period of modern Chinese literature. Writers of the thirties received sophisticated techniques and ideas from the May Fourth literature(1915-1921). The artistic insight came from the social and political crisis such as Japanese invasion in the North of China, Communist revolution and the imperialistic presence of the western powers. Writers in this period started to bond social issues, and politics in their literature. By the 1930s, literature was starting to move toward leftist ideas. Before May Fourth incident, some groups of writers attempted to make a connection between literature, politics and revolution. In 1923, Deng Zhongxia and Yun Daiying, argued that literature should act like a tool to stimulate people's revolutionary mind. In 1924 and 1925, Jiang Guangci wrote two articles. The first one is 'proletarian revolution and culture'. The second one is ' contemporary Chinese society and revolutionary literature'. Both Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu referred to the term like 'proletarian spirit' and 'class struggle' in their 1923 article. In 1925, Lu Xun sponsored the publication of a translated text called Literary debates in Soviet Russia in Peking. Nonetheless, the isolated effort did not make much impact until the May Thirtieth incident(1925). Guo Moruo was the first literary man who was involved in political field. His emotional and unrestrained language shows his passion through the article. He once said, ' From literary revolution to revolutionary literature'. This phase represented his ideal world and his strong emotion towards it. He represented the petty-bourgeois against bourgeois class. After some times, the class system started to fade and their ideology were no longer useful. He then tried to create class consciousness focusing on working and peasant class through his medium and make it accessible by everyone. The leftist debate was addressed which soon will be recognised by the public. Guo Moruo stirred the leftist influence. Guo claimed to be different from Marxism in 1924 after reading the Marxist Kawakami Hajime. He wrote 'revolution and literature', an emotional essay. He defined revolution as the rebellion against the oppressor in different period of time. He seems to conclude that the newer the better. The revolutionary action will fulfil the need for mankind and change the social organization. As a result, he argued that a good and real literature should consisted of revolutionary ideas. Since revolution literature comes with the heaviest emotion of mankind, it is as the ' golden age of literature'. Although there are many ideological debate during the early thirties, it does not contribute much to literary creativity. Some of the most creative leftist writers in the 1930s are Mao Dun, Lao She, Wu Zuxiang, Zhang Tianyi, Ba Jin, and Wen Yiduo. Their ideology were often expressed from their own analysis with artistic expression. The collective effort of the thirties is recognised as the literary 'renaissance' of fiction, poetry and drama. Before the Japanese invasion, those writers slowly settled on their own unique and matured styles of their works. Nonetheless, wars mark an end for more experimental techniques of modernistic poetry. Only dramas were popular during the war time for two purposes. Firstly, dramas acted as a tool for propaganda. The second purpose of drama acted as an escapist entertainment in Shanghai because the cities was occupied by the Japanese. The four new literary creations coming from the western world are essay, novel, modern verse, and spoken drama. The Essay Essay is the form of writing that aim to present the doctrinal debates, social criticism, and cultural criticism in the most effective way. The outcome of ideological debate lead to the popularity of 'feuilleton' in foreign terms or 'miscellaneous essay'. From this medium of writing spread the new ideology to the people who can read. Lu Xun, the outstanding essay writer of this period, made an attempt to write short essay form while he started writing short stories. His works were published in New Youth and Yu-ssu. He wrote with the vernacular language mixing with classical terms and idiom. His essays makes a satire about the society. Utilitarian ideology was used as a mean for writing. His essay not only attacked the dark side of Chinese cultures and society, but also tried to pushed the idea of collective Chinese mind to readers. His work is not clearly seen as an essay if viewed by the Westerner's eyes because they are essay, prose, poetry, and short story all at once. In the early 1930, he started to conclude more political issues in this writing. His writing stimulated the debate in the society. He himself thought that it is essential to move away from lyricism toward polemicism in order to gain political engagement. His satire became reproduced and imitated by other writers. As a result, the more shallow essays was produced and the essays were devalued. He then wrote a famous article called \\"The Crisis of Personal Essay\\" (1933). \\"Diary of a Madman\\" is one of his most famous stories. He got the style from a Russian realist named Nikolay Gogol's tales. The story was told by the perspective of a man who see traditional Confucian culture as something unpleasant for the society. The debate about Confucian ideas was on the trend during this decade. The vernacular Chinese written in the story gain popularity and attention. This common language made the war for short story in the near future. Zhou Zuoren, Lu Hsun's brother, uses essays as an alternative to prose writing. His style is similar to classical tradition namely Gong'an and Jing-line school which accentuate on personal expression. His prose is brief and elegant showing his balanced mentality. His popular essay included the \\"1981 Article\\". The essay can be categorised as a humanist literature. In other words, it is a literature against human instinct and human nature. Traditional Chinese customs was criticised. For example, the wife was bullied alive regarding the death of their husband. Fiction Fiction of the period combined mature style of writing with social analysis. Famous authors in the period include Mao Dun, Lao She, Shen Congwen, Zhang Tianyi, Ba Jin and Wu Zuxiang. Mao Dun's major pieces of fiction are Eclipse (1928), Hong or Rainbow (1933), and Ziye or Midnight. His early work experiment with the late Qing social novel with naturalism or realism, European technique. The technique was reflected through his careful arrangement of material, and the new objective point of view narrative. Characters was portrayed as a sufferer from social and economical influence. The novel shows a tragic concern that the class society will be extinct. In The Rainbow(1930),an urban intellectual represented an heroine. The story presented about young women running away from her middle-class family to join the May Thirties movement in Shanghai. The novel contains 500 pages. The set up was a massive construction of urban society in Shanghai. Chraracters are varied from bankers, landlords, students and so on while workers were not focused. Shen Congwen was also one popular. He and Lao She revealed the negative opinion toward urbanization. In Alice's Travel in China or A'li'ssu Chung-Kuo you-chi, Shen criticized the pretentious and hypocritical way of living of urban people. He sympathized on rural character who lived in the city. He tried to show that the rural characters processed 'noble savage' quality like honesty. The rural people are morally superior than those who live in the cities. Other novels included Long River and Boarder Town (1934). Lao She's vision is more toward real values of old China. His novels convey that older generation of Chinese was simple, sincere, and honest. He lived in Peking which contained various element of traditional China. His most famous novel is Camel Hsiang-tzu. The novel shows the downturn of Peking due to the erupted social change and corruption. The city is portrayed to be destroyed by the 'modernising' force. The heroine named Hsiang-tzu were victimised by many influence such as the environmental, economical changes, and the immoral middle class. This theme was also repeatedly stated in his other works. His leftist idea attempt to stimulate the public opinion for urgent collective action. After the liberation, the socialist reality was more powerful than he expected. He then commit a suicide or was murdered in 1966. Ba Jin is one of the most renown novelist of the 1930s. One of his well known novel is called The Family (1933). It was recognised as the ' Bible of modern Chinese Youth'. The story of is the account of his own experience. His story shows a conflict between the old generation and the younger generation during his lifetime. The three Kao brothers represent different types of May Fourth intellectual people rebelling against 'feudal society'. Zhang Tianyi is a left wing writer and children books' author. He believed in communist theory. Nonetheless, he was not as ideological compared to other writers. In his novel implies that change is easy when we can use normal language to express opinion and manipulate other people. Twenty-one presented problems between the soldiers and their officers. In the Spring Breeze, Zhang uses the school setting to present the class oppression. The teacher of this schools are the upperclass people, the students are poor. The teacher are cruel to the student as it portrayed the upperclass people trying to oppress the lower class. Eileen Chang was one of the most influential writer born in Shanghai. In her early life, her mother gave her books to read such as a Dream of the Red Chamber which is recognised as one of the four great classical novel of Chinese literature. These styles and inspiration in the novel was also reflected in most of her novels and works. At the age of twelve, she started to write a short novel and story published in the school magazine. Unlike the mainstream of this period influenced by the May Fourth, she wrote about the modern relationship between men and women. Her well known novels included Love in a Fallen City (1943). She referred to her own private life, and also reflected the rise of a national movement at the bottom class of Chinese modernity. This novella became a film in 1984 and then was made to be a TV series in 2009. After the Anti-Japanese War, she moved to Hong Kong and became a U.S. citizens. Regional literature The regional literature emerged as a sub-genre of fiction. This genre tried to capture the nature and feeling in rural area. Most writers came from the country side, so they depict their experience, hardships, and sometimes, discrimination that urban people have against rural people. This regional literature are mostly written to stimulate people's opinion for the revolution. One significant group of writers that will make a mark on political scene is a group of refugee from Manchuria. They were invaded by the Japanese in 1931. Their works depicting the Japanese's aggression to the people in Manchuria became famous very quickly. The story also triggered the feeling of patriotism that later spread to the entire nation. Hsiao Chun is the leader of Manchuria writers. His novels included Pu- yueh ti hsiang-ts-t'sm or Village in August. It is the first contemporary Chinese novel being translated into English. His tense emotions and experience towards everything from animals, atmosphere and suffering people lead his novel to be popular. His later works includes, The Story of Yang or The Story of Goats, and long novel named Ti-san Tai or The Third Generation. Hsiao Hung is another talented writer from the Manchuria group. She is a wife of Hsiao Chun. One of her novelette is The Field of Life and Death (1934). She was an expert in using Manchurian dialects and idioms. She gave an image of rural life as it go along with seasonal changes. She also wrote about natural stages of human life which are birth, age, sickness, and death. However, these natural cycle of life was intervened by the Japanese soldiers. The spirit of Manchuria people and region is well described by her narrative. Poetry In the early modern Chinese poetry, writers attempted to break away from the traditional rules to have free expression. Hsu Chih-mo was the very first poet who brought the Western techniques to China. He was educated in England until 1922. As a result, he is greatly influenced and inspired by the work of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. His early poem includes \\"Chih-mo's poetry\\" (1925), \\"A Night in Florence\\" (1927) and \\"Fierce Tiger\\" (1928). The well known poem for westerners would be \\"Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again\\". He died in an airplane crash on the way to Peking in 1931. Wen I-to was a friend of Hsu and also colleague at the Crescent Moon Society. Since he used to do painting, his poem is visually imaginable. His works explored on formalistic element. Instead of making it simple like other authors in this period, symbolism elements were included in his poems. The aim of his poem is to \\"recapture the symbolism and ethos of premodern Chinese society\\". In other words, he wanted to capture the culture of people in this period of time through his poem. His early works surprised the readers with metaphors and allusion. The popular words include, \\"Red Candles\\" (1923), and \\"Dead Water\\" (1929). Drama Drama in this period can be called as 'New theatre', 'New drama', or 'Civilised drama'. The beginning of modern Chinese China was triggered by the inspiration from the western world similarly to Chinese poetry. The initial effort began by the foundation of Spring Willow Society in Japan in 1907. They began by translating the plays such as La Dame aux Camelias. One element of this Civilised drama was the 'spoken drama' contradicting to the traditional 'singing drama'. This form was adopted by Ti-ien Han. The purpose of these dramas is to distribute and propagate new ideas. Ts'ao Yu was one of the most popular playwright in modern China. He wrote his first play, Thunderstrorm (1934) while he was a student at Tsing-Hua. The story is about the mental and physical downfall of one family due to incest. The story criticises the strict tradition and pretentious actions of the Westernised Zhou family. This play was performed in 1935, then went on tour. Another famous play was Sunrise (1936). This story tell about the corruption, the extravagant life of the rich in China and the suffering of the poor in China. Chen Balu, the high class prostitute in Shiang Hai in 1930s, was the main protagonist. She enjoyed the luxurious life, however, she ends up committing a suicide due her bankruptcy, the death of a young girl who she tried to save from being a prostitute, and the end of her first boyfriend. Magazine New Youth was a magazine which started being published by Chen Duxiu in 1915. He was a journalist and politician, and regarded as one of the leaders of New Culture Movement. He made his efforts to modernize Chine by introducing Euro-American culture, which was based on science and democracy, and showed his rejection of traditional Chinese literature and aesthetic. He became the first general secretary of the Chinese Communists in 1921. Weekly Critic was a magazine, which was first published in 1918 by Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao. They dedicated to discuss national and world politics. The magazine identified history' goal with the advantage of Western democracy and science as well as New Youth, and mainly criticized the Chinese government. New Tide was launched by some senior students from Peking University in 1919. They were influenced by New Youth and Weekly Critic and followed the thought of them. In opposition to the New Literature Movement, The National Heritage was published by the exponents of the classical pattern of literature in Peking University. They only published the articles written in Chinese classical style. In the same way, a group of professors of the Higher Normal College in Nanking started publishing a magazine called The Critical Review all in classical language.  Agriculture  During the republican era, Chinese economy was mostly agricultural. In 1933, it was estimated at 65 percent of the total net domestic product. This output, whose sectors were plant, animal, Forest, Fishery and Miscellaneous products, was supposed to be produced by 205 million agricultural workers, which counted 79 percent of the labor force. Plant products dominated, and the estimate shows that 80 percent of the plant products are composed of food crops like rice, wheat and other grain, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits. Until 1937, the total output of agriculture kept growing as the population increased. Japanese invasion and the war in the mid 1937 is regarded as the factor of the decline. War and civil war between 1937 and 1949 made it impossible to collect the rural statistical data of the Nanking Government. Especially farmers in North China were affected badly because of the damage to the land, transport disruptions, conscription of manpower and draught of animals, and request of grain for the armies. =The Regional Differences of Agriculture= The number of rural family might range from four to 30, and the size of village varied. Northeastern China was favored with enough fertile land, which brought immigrants from the northern provinces. They farmed the soy beans and food grains. In east-central China, which was rice-wheat region, and there had warmer climate, unvaried rainfall, and slightly acidic soil, and favored higher crop yields. In the foremost south-east province of Kwangtung, which is tropical area, peasants engaged in growing fruits and fish farming, and cultivating varied crops with rice. In central, south east, and south west Chine, because of the climate and soil there, a cycle of two crops a year was common while three crops every two years practiced in North.  Architecture  =Development phases= May Fourth Movement to the outbreak of anti-Japanese War (1919-1937) This is the stage of the prosperity and development of Chinese modern architecture. During 1920 to 1930, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Nanjing and other major cities and some provincial capitals, building activities are increasing. Nanjing, Shanghai, respectively, the \\"Capital Plan\\" and \\"Big Shanghai Urban Plan\\", the construction of a number of administrative buildings. The Construction of residential buildings, in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou and some cities in the northeast, a number of high-rise buildings with higher levels of modernization have been built. Especially in Shanghai, has 28 high- rise buildings over 10 stories in the period. Building technology has made great progress in these 20 years. Many high-rise, large, long-span, complex projects to achieve a high construction quality. Some of the buildings in the design and technical equipment has been close to the foreign advanced level. The ranks of Chinese architects have grown. The architects who returned from abroad have set up the Chinese architects ' office and have set up the architectural specialty in the middle and higher schools, introduced and disseminated the architectural technology and creative ideas of the developed countries. In 1927, the Chinese Institute of Architects and the Shanghai Association of Architects founded. Respectively, published a professional publication \\"China Architecture\\" (1932) and the \\"Building Monthly Publication\\" (1932). In 1929, Society for the Study of Chinese Architecture founded. The architects Liang Sicheng, Research work in the society. Modern Chinese architecture in this stage is not only the introduction of Western architecture, but also a combination of China's actual creation of some modern architecture with Chinese characteristics. Outbreak of anti-Japanese War to the People's Republic of China (1937-1949) This is the stagnation period of Chinese modern architecture. During the anti-Japanese war, China's construction industry was in a state of depression. After the Second World War, many countries were actively engaged in post-war construction and the construction activities were very active. Through the spread of Western architectural books and the introduction of a few newly returned architects, Chinese architects have more contact with the thought of modern architecture abroad. Only in this period, China is in the domestic war environment, there are few construction activities, and modern architectural trend of thought has no great influence on Chinese construction practice. =Residential Buildings= Modern China's rural, market town, Small and medium-sized cities and large cities in the old urban areas, still take the traditional residential form. The new type of residential building is mainly concentrated in some parts of big city. This kind of new house has the basic form of single type, Lian-Hu type and multi type. alt= Single-family houses These appeared in the 1900 before and after the detached-style senior residential. These dwellings are basically a replica of the high-end residential buildings that were popular in the west, and are generally located in the urban environment. Most of the appearance are like the French, Britain, Germany form of a mansion, the occupants are mainly foreign officials and capitalists. Inside of Haonan Villa Before and after the Xinhai Revolution, Chinese top people also began to build. From the modern businessman Zhang Jian in Nantong \\"Haonan Villa\\", the characteristics of the high-grade residential: architectural forms and technical equipment are mostly adopted Western style, while the room layout, decoration, garden and others preserve the Chinese traditional characteristics. Since the 1920s, the single-family residential form has gradually shifted from luxurious detached-style high-class residences to comfortable garden residences, and the number of construction has increased, and the garden residential areas have been formed in Shanghai and Nanjing. Lian-Hu type Shikumen House called Longtang was first in the 20th century in Shanghai, is imported from Europe intensive living methods. Then Hankou, Nanjing, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Qingdao and other land in the concession, Wharf, commercial center near the formation of residential areas. The residential buildings in Shanghai are divided into stone gate as \\"Shikumen\\", new ones, garden lanes and apartment-style homes according to the needs of different classes of residents. The early Shikumen clearly reflect the intersection of Chinese and Western architectural styles. The residential area is compact in layout, economical in land use and full in space. =Architects= Liang Sicheng Liang Sicheng Liang Sicheng (Ê¢ÅÊÄùÊàê; April 20, 1901 ‚Äì January 9, 1972) is the author of China's first modern history on Chinese architecture and founder of the Architecture Department of Northeast University in 1928 and Tsinghua University in 1946. He was the Chinese representative in the Design Board which designed the United Nations headquarters in New York. He, along with Lin Huiyin (1904‚Äì1955), Mo Zongjiang (1916‚Äì1999), and Ji Yutang (1902‚Äìc. 1960s), discovered and analyzed the first and second oldest timber structures still standing in China, located at Nanchan Temple and Foguang Temple at Mount Wutai. He is recognized as the \\"Father of Modern Chinese Architecture\\". To cite Princeton University, which awarded him an honorary doctoral degree in 1947, he was \\"a creative architect who has also been a teacher of architectural history, a pioneer in historical research and exploration in Chinese architecture and planning, and a leader in the restoration and preservation of the priceless monuments of his country.\\"Zheng Limin(2011,July 17),Liang Sicheng - Father of Modern Chinese Architecture, http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/journeysintime/20110617/105582.shtml Du Guangan In 1930s, China has emerged a large number of outstanding architects, known as the Chinese architects \\"self-reliance\\" period. Du Guangan was graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1930 Graduate School of Architecture. He taught at the Department of Architecture in Northeastern University. Also he had worked with Liang Sicheng to carry out the study of ancient Chinese architecture, and completed the history of Chinese architecture at the end of the war. He has designed many excellent buildings for Qingdao, and actively participates in the construction of new China after the founding of the PRC. Feminism movement = Xinhai Revolution and Women Suffrage Movement =  Spread of feminism idea  Before the breakout of Xinhai Revolution, revolutionists spread the idea of gender equality, using the liberation of genderto appeal all women to join the revolution. In 1903, Zou Rong made the follow statement in his work The Revolutionary Army: Anyone belongs to citizen of China regardless of gender; People are equal whatever gender they are as long as they belong to citizen. In the same year, Jin Tianhe also published his work about feminism, criticizing traditional moral standard and suggesting to educate female on a higher standard. In 1907, Qiu Jin established a newspaper called 'Chinese Women's News', criticizing traditional limitation on gender and spreading gender equality, appealing women to do more things than housework. Shen Peizhen  Breakout of Xinhai Revolution and females' participation  In 1911, under Sun Yat-sen's leadership, bourgeois-democratic revolutionary, Xinhai Revolution, broke out. Female troops in Shanghai made their contribution to the overthrow of Qing Dynasty. Under the leadership of Shanghai Hospital's president Zhang Zhujun, Red cross was organized with hundreds of people to participate in nursing the injury on the battlefield in multi-places, including Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and so on. Moreover, even several military organizations which are made up by female appeared. They officially received the instruction and weapons from government. They had good performance in the overthrow of Qing Dynasty. In southern cities such as Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing, and so on, wives of several officers organized donation activity to support temporary government in Nanking for soldiers' pay and provision, as well as their uniforms, etc. Some participants even donated their own ornaments. Even Sun Yat-sen praised their efforts. Many female revolutionists appeared in this era. Feminists worked on mobilizing women to join the revolution as well as improving their status by a varieties of means, service, education, nursing, donation. They were trying to change women's unequal status by directly participating in the overthrow of current political order.  Demand of suffrage  After the establishment of Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912), women from all fields started to demand their political rights, especially suffrage rights. Tang Qunying During the draft of Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, no terms or articles mentioned anything about gender equality. Tang Qunying, the president of the Women's Backup Society, demanded the provisional government to give suffrage right for women. She made 5 proposals to provisional senate and Sun Yat-sen himself, neither was accepted by senate. On March 20, she led a group of women rushed who into the meeting room, broke the glass windows and attacked the guards. In September 1913, the president of International Alliance of Women, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Shanghai to investigate the situation of women's suffrage. During her tenure, women in the United States successfully got the suffrage right. However, in November of the same year, Minister of Internal Affairs forced all organizations related with women suffrage to dissolute. Hunan Warlod - Zhao Hengti In 1924, when Zhao Hengti was in charge of Hunan Province, who advocates of a federalist constitution, Hunan committee of federalist constitution finally agreed to add terms about gender equality in provincial constitution. This term guarantees the gender equality on politic and education. This is the first time constitution in China included terms about gender equality. In the early 20th century, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan had the most activate suffrage movement about constitution, whose participants were mainly female students in urban areas. Except the victory of Hunan in 1924 and victory in Zhejiang in 1921, all the other movements ended in failure. After the failure on politics, the feminist politicians focused on other fields. Tang Qunying focused on women colleges, and Shen Peizhen established factories to attract women to work. = Anti-imperialist Patriotic Movement from feminists' perspective = Through the history of Chinese revolution from late Qing Dynasty to the Republic Era, besides reformists and revolutionists, feminists also contributed their power in various political movement about patriotism and anti-imperialism. They were represented by the moderate women and young female college students. They participated in various kind of activities, including donation, speech, and entrepreneurship. On March 24, 1901, almost one thousand patriots gathered in Shanghai, protesting Russia's intention to occupy Manchuria. During that meeting, Xue Jinqin, a 16-year-old girl, delivered a speech criticizing Russia and Qing Dynasty, suggest to replace foreign minister. This speech is the first public speech delivered by woman in Chinese history. In 1907, several southern provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan and others, started actions against Britain imperialists' attempt to control railroads in China. Feminists also joined it. On September 28, patriotic female college students held a meeting to resist loans for Hu-Hang-Yong Railroad. On that meeting, official request to government and purchase of shares had been made. From 1912, feminists responded the call of Sun Yat-sen by establishing female industries, which can be regarded as one part of enterprise salvation movement. = New Culture Movement and Sexual liberation = New Youth (La Jeunesse)  'New Youth' and revolution in ideology  Chen Duxiu emphasized feminism from a socialist perspective. Chen thinks that the dependence to male directly leads to the personal dependence of female to male, thus, women must work to liberate themselves. Lu Xun, who grew up in a traditional landlord family, criticized traditional view of virginity, pointed out that such demands on virginity and loyalty to women is extremely immoral, and is also not beneficial to both individuals and society. Hu Shih also talked about virginity issue. He thinks virginity is an attitude of man and woman treating each other, it is not exclusively to woman, but should serve as restriction on moth male and female.  Sexual liberation  In the beginning of 1927, nationalist government moved from Guangzhou to Wuhan, made it center of national revolution. March 8, the nationalist government arranged more than 200,000 people to celebrate International Women's Day. Member of women's association were promoting the concept of marriage freedom and love freedom, criticizing traditional practice of foot binding and breast binding. In the same year July, Guangdong committee of nationalist government passed the proposal to officially ban the breast binding. = Feminism in suburbs and Communist movement = Xiang Jingyu Generally speaking, there were 3 kinds of feminists movement in Chinese suburb areas: revolutionary movement about political and legal equality, Christianity movement about charity and social service, communist movement aim to get economic interest. During the 3rd National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Guangzhou, for the first time, women have as much rights as men. the proposal drafted by Xiang Jingyu got passed, which clearly announced that women shall have right of inheritance, freedom on marriage, divorce and labor. = Yan'An Period =  Marriage and sex regulation: from absolute freedom to freedom  China revolution is first of all a political revolution and social revolution, but one the target to be criticized includes traditional morality, moreover, \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Liberation\\" are in the slogan of promotion, thus, for young people who were interested in communist party, the freedom of marriage also means freedom of sex. This freedom of sex and ignorance on physiology led to increase on abortion and further decrease of military capacity in the army. Moreover, taking peasants' conservatism into consideration, the communist party started to change the law on marriage from absolute freedom to freedom. After Red Army reached the north of Shanxi Province in 1939, Shan-Gan-Ning government announced Marriage Regulation of Shan-Gan-Ning, which has specific requirement on various situation of marriage. While the legislation was transforming, the propaganda was changing as well. The slogan of marriage freedom is replaced by harmony of family, as well as the emphasize on caution and consideration in official files and papers related with marriage and family. Communist Party did not give up on the liberation of gender, women can still divorce if they cannot tolerate, which is clearly stated in that regulation as well. But communists started to think the slogan of feminist movement must be made based on the recognize level of peasants themselves. What's more important, facing the threat from Kuomintang, Imperial Japan, and local warlords, Communist party had to put more weight on peasants' interest rather than women's. Media =New Youth= This is one of the representative modernism magazines which was popular in 1920s to 1930s. Is related with the concept of literacy evolution. This book led to spread the world of thoughts in 1910s. The representative slogan was \\"democratic and science\\", the contributors appealed to establish the new culture, which is based on \\"democratic\\" and \\"science\\". Main writers of \\"New Youth\\" is occupied by the intellectual class in Beijing especially among Beijing University such as Lu Xun, Hu Shih and Zhou Zuoren. Thanks to their contributions, the important concepts whose origins were from Modern Western such as human beings, romantics and currency systems are spread in Chinese literature all at once. New Youth was very popular among intellectuals who lived in cities and known as \\"city magazine\\". =Lu Xun= Lu Xun was the pen name of Zhou Shuren (September 25, 1881 ‚Äì October 19, 1936), a leading figure of modern Chinese literature. Writing in Vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese, he was a short story writer, editor, translator, literary critic, essayist, poet, and designer. In the 1930s, he became the titular head of the League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai. After the 1919 May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun's writing began to exert a substantial influence on Chinese literature and popular culture. Like many leaders of the May Fourth Movement, he was primarily a leftist and liberal. He was highly acclaimed by the Chinese government after 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, and Mao Zedong himself was a lifelong admirer of Lu Xun's writing. Though sympathetic to socialist ideas, Lu Xun never joined the Communist Party of China. =Hu Shih= Hu Shih (December 17, 1891 ‚Äì February 24, 1962) was a Chinese philosopher, essayist and diplomat. Hu is widely recognized today as a key contributor to Chinese liberalism and language reform in his advocacy for the use of written vernacular Chinese. He was influential in the May Fourth Movement, one of the leaders of China's New Culture Movement, was a president of Peking University, and in 1939 was nominated for a Nobel Prize in literature. He had a wide range of interests such as literature, history, textual criticism, and pedagogy. Hu was well known as the primary advocate for the literary revolution of the era, a movement which aimed to replace scholarly classical Chinese in writing with the vernacular spoken language, and to cultivate and stimulate new forms of literature. In an article originally published in New Youth in January 1917 titled \\"A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform\\", Hu originally emphasized eight guidelines that all Chinese writers should take to heart in writing: Write with substance. By this, Hu meant that literature should contain real feeling and human thought. This was intended to be a contrast to the recent poetry with rhymes and phrases that Hu saw as being empty. Do not imitate the ancients. Literature should not be written in the styles of long ago, but rather in the modern style of the present era. Respect grammar. Hu did not elaborate at length on this point, merely stating that some recent forms of poetry had neglected proper grammar. Reject melancholy. Recent young authors often chose grave pen names, and wrote on such topics as death. Hu rejected this way of thinking as being unproductive in solving modern problems. Eliminate old clich√©s. The Chinese language has always had numerous four-character sayings and phrases used to describe events. Hu implored writers to use their own words in descriptions, and deplored those who did not. Do not use allusions. By this, Hu was referring to the practice of comparing present events with historical events even when there is no meaningful analogy. Do not use couplets or parallelism. Though these forms had been pursued by earlier writers, Hu believed that modern writers first needed to learn the basics of substance and quality, before returning to these matters of subtlety and delicacy. Do not avoid popular expressions or popular forms of characters. This rule, perhaps the most well-known, ties in directly with Hu's belief that modern literature should be written in the vernacular, rather than in Classical Chinese. He believed that this practice had historical precedents, and led to greater understanding of important texts.

He was particularly powerful during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui and became prime minister, and was faulted by traditional historians for placating Emperor Yang and not reacting properly to agrarian rebellions. When Emperor Yang was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji in 618, Yu was also killed.  During Chen Dynasty  It is not known when Yu Shiji was born. His father Yu Li (ËôûËçî) was a mid-level official during Chen Dynasty. Yu Shiji was considered knowledgeable and quiet in his youth, and was particularly good at calligraphy. The high- level officials Kong Huan (Â≠îÂ•ê) and Xu Ling (ÂæêÈôµ) were both impressed with him, and Xu was so impressed that he compared Yu Shiji to Pan Jun and Lu Xun, and gave a niece to him in marriage. He initially served on the staff of Chen Shuyin (Èô≥ÂèîËã±) the Prince of Jian'an‚Äîthe brother to Chen's last emperor Chen Shubao, and later served in the imperial administration as well. Once, Chen Shubao was impressed with an essay Yu wrote on historical uses of the military and he awarded Yu a horse.  During Emperor Wen's reign  In 589, Chen was conquered by Sui Dynasty, and Yu subsequently served in Sui's legislative bureau (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng) as a low-level official during the reign of Emperor Wen. Despite his position, however, he had little money, and he was forced to take retainers in writing calligraphy in order to support his parent(s). He once wrote a poem about his poverty, and the poem became famous and praised for its beauty. Eventually, he was promoted within the legislative bureau.  During Emperor Yang's reign  In 604, Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yang. Emperor Yang was impressed with Yu's talent and began to promote him, particularly after Liu Guyan (Êü≥È°ßË®Ä), the head of the Palace Library, endorsed Yu, and Yu was promoted to be the deputy head of the legislative bureau. His mother soon died, however, and he left imperial service to serve a mourning period, although Emperor Yang soon recalled him to governmental service. Emperor Yang made him, along with Niu Hong (ÁâõÂºò), Su Wei, Yuwen Shu, Zhang Jin (ÂºµÁëæ), Pei Yun (Ë£¥Ëòä), and Pei Ju in charge of selecting and promoting officials, and they were known as the \\"seven nobles of officialdom.\\" However, it was said that the actual selective powers were in Yu's hands, and that Yu became exceedingly corrupt, making recommendations based on the amount of bribes that he received. It was further said that he was so enamored with his second wife Lady Su that he spent much of his gains in impressing and decorating her. He thus became despised by the people, particularly in comparison to his brother Yu Shinan, who was praised for his integrity. It was said that a major reason why Emperor Yang trusted Yu greatly was that Yu was good at figuring out what he intended and following it, notwithstanding any adverse impact such decisions might have on the government or the populace. He appeared to suffer no adverse consequences from his son Yu Zirou (ËôûÂ≠êÊüî)'s joining the rebellion of Yang Xuangan in 613, and even Yu Zirou was not executed after Emperor Yang's forces defeated Yang Xuangan. In the fall of 615, while Emperor Yang was touring the northern frontier of his empire, the Eastern Turkish (Tujue) leader Shibi Khan launched a surprise attack against Yanmen Commandery. His wife, the Chinese princess Yicheng, sent her kinsman the emperor a secret warning about the attack but the emperor was only able to reach the commandery seat at present-day Daixian in Shanxi.. The khan then put the town under siege on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. Emperor Yang was frightened, but Yu suggested that he try to restore the morale by announcing publicly that he was terminating the campaigns against Goguryeo and would award the soldiers greatly if they could lift the siege. Following his brother-in-law Xiao Yu's advice, however, the emperor also sought further help from Princess Yicheng, who sent her husband a false report of a northern attack on the khaganate. Between this report and others informing him of the arrival of Chinese reinforcements, Shibi Khan lifted the siege and returned home. With credit for his salvation murky, the emperor followed the advice of Su Wei and others to renege on most of his extravagant promises of reward; he also returned to Luoyang and began planning another expedition against Goguryeo, causing still more disaffection throughout the army. Resentment among the people was also aimed at Yu. In 616, because much of Sui territory had become engulfed in agrarian rebellions, Yu suggested that an army be stationed at Luokou Storage (Ê¥õÂè£ÂÄâ, near the eastern capital Luoyang) to protect it from pillagers, and Emperor Yang rebuked him for being fearful. From that point on, Yu no longer suggested any tactics against the rebels, figuring out that Emperor Yang did not want to hear about the rebels. When the general Yang Yichen was able to defeat several major rebels north of the Yellow River and forced many rebels to surrender, Emperor Yang was surprised at how many rebels surrendered‚Äîand Yu responded by stating, falsely, that Yang Yichen had been able to get all of them to surrender and that Emperor Yang no longer needed to worry. Subsequently, at Yu's instigation, probably because both Yu and Emperor Yang were apprehensive of Yang Yichen's responsibilities, Yang Yichen's forces were disbanded, and Yang Yichen himself was recalled to the imperial government around the new year 617 and ostensibly promoted but was detached from the army. Once Yang Yichen's campaigns terminated, the rebellions went unchecked. Later in 617, against the advice of a number of officials, Emperor Yang left Luoyang to go to Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). After Emperor Yang left Luoyang, the rebels became particularly encouraged, and one of the major rebels, Li Mi, seized not only Luokou Storage but also Huiluo Storage (ÂõûÊ¥õÂÄâ), making his army well- supplied while depriving the Sui forces at Luoyang of food supplies. Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong the Prince of Yue, left in charge of Luoyang, sent his staff member Yuan Shanda (ÂÖÉÂñÑÈÅî) to Jiangdu to request help from Emperor Yang, and Yuan tearfully reported to Emperor Yang, \\"Li Mi has several million men. He has put Luoyang under siege and occupied Luokou Storage, making Luoyang lack food. If Your Imperial Majesty shall return quickly, his band of men will disband; otherwise, the eastern capital will surely fall.\\" Emperor Yang was touched, but Yu responded, \\"The Prince of Yue is young and easy to deceive. If the bandits are really that strong, how could Yuan Shanda get here?\\" Emperor Yang thus became convinced that Yuan was deceiving him and ordered him to go to a rebel-occupied commandery to collect food supplies, and Yuan was killed by the rebels. Thereafter, few officials dared to speak about the rebels. By spring 618, Emperor Yang, aware that rebels had occupied much of the northern empire, no longer had any intent to return to the north, wishing to take refuge at Danyang (‰∏πÊ•ä, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), south of the Yangtze River. Yu endorsed the plan, and despite opposition by the general Li Cai (ÊùéÊâç), Emperor Yang began building a palace at Danyang in anticipation of moving the capital there. The elite Xiaoguo Army, then with Emperor Yang at Jiangdu, was protecting Emperor Yang, but their ranks, stricken with homesickness, was suffering many defections. Several of its commanders believed that they would be punished, and they decided to carry out a coup, with Yuwen Shu's son Yuwen Huaji the Duke of Xu as their leader. The general Zhang Huishao (ÂºµÊÉ†Á¥π) heard about the plot and reported it to Pei Yun, and Pei and Zhang planned to issue a false edict to have Yuwen Huaji arrested and then mobilize the troops against the coup leaders. They report to Yu, and Yu, believing that the report was false, refused to support the plan. The coup soon went into action, and the coup leaders killed Emperor Yang, and then killed many of his relatives and high-level officials. Yu was one that they were ready to execute. Yu's sons Yu Xi (ËôûÁÜô), Yu Rou, and Yu Hui (ËôûÊô¶) all offered to die before their father, and were executed first. Yu Shi'nan offered to die instead of Yu Shiji, but the coup leaders did not accept the offer and executed Yu Shiji.

More recent versions of the concept also include the decisions themselves in their own DD-paths. A flow graph of a program. Each color denotes a different DD-path. Nodes 1,2,5 and 6 are each in their own DD-path containing a single node. Nodes 3 and 4 together form one DD-path (they are a maximal chain). Definition In Huang's 1975 paper, The definition given there is citing: \\"Fortran automated verification system Level 1 ‚Äî user's guide, Program Validation Project, General Research Corp., October 1974.\\" a decision-to-decision path is defined as path in a program's flowchart such that all the following hold (quoting from the paper): * its first constituent edge emanates either from an entry node or a decision box; * its last constituent edge terminates either at a decision box or at an exit node; and * there are no decision boxes on the path except those at both ends Jorgensen's more recent textbooks restate it in terms of a program's flow graph (called a \\"program graph\\" in that textbook). First define some preliminary notions: chain and a maximal chain. A chain is defined as a path in which: * initial and terminal nodes are distinct, and * all interior nodes have in-degree = 1 and out-degree = 1. A maximal chain is a chain that is not part of a bigger chain. A DD-path is a set of nodes in a program graph such that one of the following holds (quoting and keeping Jorgensen's numbering, with comments added in parenthesis): # It consists of a single node with in-degree = 0 (initial node) # It consists of a single node with out-degree = 0 (terminal node) # It consists of a single node with in-degree ‚â• 2 or out-degree ‚â• 2 (decision/merge points) # It consists of a single node with in-degree = 1 and out-degree = 1 # It is a maximal chain of length ‚â• 1. According to Jorgensen (2013), in Great Britain and ISTQB literature, the same notion is called linear code sequence and jump (LCSAJ). Properties  From the latter definition (of Jorgensen) we can conclude the following: * Every node on a flow graph of a program belongs to one DD-path. * If the first node on a DD- path is traversed, then all other nodes on that path will also be traversed. * The DD path graph is used to find independent path for testing. * Every statement in the program has been executed at least once.  DD-path testing  According to Jorgensen's 2013 textbook, DD-path testing is the best known code-based testing method, incorporated in numerous commercial tools.

AOP is a normochronic, normocytic hypoproliferative anemia. The primary mechanism of AOP is a decrease in erythropoietin (EPO), a red blood cell growth factor. Pathophysiology Preterm infants are often anemic and typically experience heavy blood losses from frequent laboratory testing in the first few weeks of life. Although their anemia is multifactorial, repeated blood sampling and reduced erythropoiesis with extremely low serum levels of erythropoietin (EPO) are major causative factors.Adams, M., Benitz, W., Geaghan, S., Kumar, R., Madan, A., & Widness, J.

Blood sampling done for laboratory testing can easily remove enough blood to produce anemia. Obladen, Sachsenweger and Stahnke (1987) studied 60 very low birth weight infants during the first 28 days of life. Infants were divided into 3 groups, group 1 (no ventilator support, 24 ml/kg blood loss), group 2(minor ventilated support, 60 ml/kg blood loss), and group 3(ventilated support for respiratory distress syndrome, 67 ml/kg blood loss). Infants were checked for clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of anemia 24 hours before and after the blood transfusion. The study found that groups 2 and 3 who had significant amount of blood loss, showed poor weight gain, pallor and distended abdomen. These reactions are the most frequent symptoms of anemia in very low birth weight infants.Obladen, M., Sachsenweger, M., & Stahnke, M. (1988). Blood sampling in very low birth weight infants receiving different levels of intensive care. Abstract retrieved November 27, 2007, from EbscoHost Research Databases. During the first weeks of life, all infants experience a decline in circulating red blood cell (RBC) volume generally expressed as blood hemoglobin concentration (Hb).Strauss, R. (n.d.). Neonatal anemia: Pathophysiology and treatment. Transfusion Immunology and Medicine, 341-343. Retrieved December 10, 2007, from Google Scholar Research Databases. As anemia develops, there is even more of a significant reduction in the concentration of hemoglobin.Boxwell G. (2000). Chapter 8 hematological problems: Anemia. Neonatal Intensive Care Nursing, 164-187. Retrieved December 12, 2007, from EbscoHost Research Databases. Normally this stimulates a significant increased production of erythropoietin (EPO), but this response is diminished in premature infants. Dear, Gill, Newell, Richards and Schwarz (2005) conducted a study to show that there is a weak negative correlation between EPO and Hb. The researchers recruited 39 preterm infants from 10 days of age or as soon as they could manage without respiratory support. They estimated total EPO and Hb weekly and 2 days after a blood transfusion. The study found that when Hb>10, EPO mean was 20.6 and when Hb‚â§10, EPO mean was 26.8. As Hb goes down, EPO goes up.Dear, F., Gill, G., Newell, J., Richards, M., & Schwarz B. (2005). Effects of transfusion in anemia of prematurity. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology 22, 551-559. Retrieved December 9, 2007, from EbscoHost Research Databases. While the reason for this decreased response is not fully understood, Strauss (n.d.) states that it results from both physiological factors (e.g., the rapid rate of growth and need for a commensurate increase in RBC mass to accompany the increase in blood volume) and, in sick premature infants, from phlebotomy blood losses. In premature infants this decline occurs earlier and more pronounced that it does in healthy term infants. Healthy term infants Hb rarely falls below 9 g/dL at an age of approximately 10‚Äì12 weeks, while in premature infants, even in those without complicating illnesses, the mean Hb falls to approximately 8g/dL in infants of 1.0-1.5 kg birth weight and to 7g/dL in infants <1.0 kg. Because this postnatal drop in hemoglobin level is universal and is well tolerated in term infants, it is commonly referred to as the ‚Äúphysiologic‚Äù anemia of infancy. However, in premature infants the decline in Hb may be associated with abnormal clinical signs severe enough to prompt transfusions. Treatment =Transfusion= AOP is usually treated by blood transfusion but the indications for this are still unclear. Blood transfusions have both infectious and non-infectious risks associated with them. Also, blood transfusions are costly and may add to parental anxiety. The best treatment for AOP is prevention of worsening of anemia by minimizing the amount of blood drawn from the infant (ie, anemia from phlebotomy). It is found that since blood loss attributable to laboratory testing is the primary cause of anemia among preterm infants during the first weeks of life, it would be useful to quantify blood loss attributable to phlebotomy overdraw (ie, blood collected in excess than what is strictly required for the requested lab tests). Lin and colleagues performed a study to see when and if phlebotomy overdraw was actually a significant problem. They recorded all of the data that could be of influence such as the test performed, the blood collection container used, the infants location (neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and intermediate intensive care unit), the infant‚Äôs weight sampling and the phlebotomist‚Äôs level of experience, work shift, and clinical role. Infants were classified by weight into 3 groups: <1 kg, 1 to 2 kg, and >2 kg. The volume of blood removed was calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty collection container from that of the container filled with blood. They found that the mean volume of blood drawn for the 578 tests exceeded that requested by the hospital laboratory by 19.0% ¬± 1.8% per test. The main factors of overdraw was: collection in blood containers without fill-lines, lighter weight infants and critically ill infants being cared for in the NICU. =EPO= Recombinant EPO (r-EPO) may be given to premature infants to stimulate red blood cell production. Brown and Keith studied two groups of 40 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants to compare the erythropoietic response between two and five times a week dosages of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-EPO) using the same dose. They established that more frequent dosing of the same weekly amount of r-EPO generated a significant and continuous increase in Hb in VLBW infants. The infants that received five dosages had higher absolute reticulocyte counts (219,857 mm¬≥) than those infants that received only two dosages (173,361 mm¬≥). However, it was noted that the response to r-EPO typically takes up to two weeks. This study also showed responses between two dosage schedules (two times a week and five times a week). Infants were recruited for gestational age‚Äîage since conception‚Äî‚â§27 weeks and 28 to 30 weeks and then randomized into the two groups, each totaling 500 U/kg a week. Brown and Keith found that after two weeks of r-EPO administration, Hb counts had increased and leveled off; the infants who received r-EPO five times a week had significantly higher Hb counts. This was present at four weeks for all infants ‚â§30 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks for infants ‚â§27 weeks gestation. To date, studies of r-EPO use in premature infants have had mixed results. Ohls et al. examined the use of early r-EPO plus iron and found no short-term benefits in two groups of infants (172 infants less than 1000 g and 118 infants 1000‚Äì1250 g). All r-EPO treated infants received 400 U/g three times a week until they reached 35 weeks gestational age. The use of r-EPO did not decrease the average number of transfusions in the infants born at less than 1000 g, or the percentage of infants in the 1000 to 1250 group. A multi- center European trial studied early versus late r-EPO in 219 infants with birth weights between 500 and 999 g. An r-EPO close of 750 U/kg/week was given to infants in both the early (1‚Äì9 weeks) and late (4‚Äì10 weeks) groups. The two r-EPO groups were compared to a control group who did not receive r-EPO. Infants in all three groups received 3 to 9 mg/kg of enteral iron. These investigators reported a slight decrease in transfusion and donor exposures in the early r-EPO group (1‚Äì9 weeks): 13% early, 11% late and 4% control group.Bain, A., & Blackburn, S. (2004). Issues in transfusing preterm infants in the NICU. Journal of Perinatal and Neonatal Nursing 18(2), 170-182. Retrieved December 4, 2007, from EbscoHost Research Databases. It is likely that only a carefully selected subpopulation of infants may benefit from its use. Contrary to what just said, Bain and Blackburn (2004) also state in another study the use of r-EPO does not appear to have a significant effect on reducing the numbers of early transfusions in most infants, but may be useful to reduce numbers of late transfusion in extremely low-birth-weight infants. A British task force to establish transfusion guidelines for neonates and young children and to help try to explain this confusion recently concluded that ‚Äúthe optimal dose, timing, and nutritional support required during EPO treatment has yet to be defined and currently the routine use of EPO in this patient population is not recommended as similar reduction in blood use can probably be achieved with appropriate transfusion protocols.‚Äù =Transfusion management= Other strategies involve the reduction of blood loss during phlebotomy. For extremely low birth weight infants, laboratory blood testing using bedside devices offers a unique opportunity to reduce blood transfusions. This practice has been referred to as point-of-care testing or POC. Use of POC tests to measure the most commonly ordered blood tests could significantly decrease phlebotomy loss and lead to a reduction in the need for blood transfusions among critically ill premature neonates as these tests frequently require much less volume of blood to be collected from the patient. A study was done by Madan and colleagues to test this theory by conducting a retrospective chart review on all inborn infants <1000g admitted to the NICU that survived for 2 weeks of age during two separate 1 year time periods. Conventional bench top laboratory analysis during the first year was done using Radiometer Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer. Bedside blood gas analysis during the second year was performed using a point-of-care analyzer (iSTAT). An estimated blood loss in the two groups was determined based on the number of specific blood tests on individual infants. The study found that there was an estimated 30% reduction in the total volume of blood removed for the blood tests. This study concluded that there is modern technology that can be used to limit the amount of blood removed from these infants thereby reducing the need for blood product transfusions (or the number of transfusions) and r-EPO.

Pensionnat Saint-Joseph, a school for boys, was first established in Pera (now Beyoglu) in 1857. Its successor Fr√®res des Ecoles Chr√©tiennes was established in 1860. At one time it moved to a rental property in Moda, Kadƒ±k√∂y but in 1864 it returned to Pera as it could no longer occupy the building, as the owner had sold it to someone else. Sultan Abdulaziz gave permission for the school to build its own building in 1864, but he had to issue another declaration doing the same in 1870 as the original declaration disappeared. 16 August 1870 was the start of construction. It established a campus in Pera. Accordingly 1870 is listed as the founding year of the school. \\\\- See school logo. The society has since opened schools in Izmir and Istanbul. Currently, Fran Society has 7,225 members, 60,000 teachers, and 785,127 students. They have 1,800 schools in 84 different countries. The school has celebrated their 50th anniversary in 1921, 100th in 1971 and 125th in 1996. The school began admitting girls in 1987.

In 1903, the brothers would shift into the department store business, opening in the newly built Snell Building at Broadway and 11th Street in the heart of Tacoma's retail core. The store achieved great success, and by 1911, three floors were added to the building, eventually bringing it to 170,000 ft¬≤ (15793.52m¬≤), including a tea room (opened in 1908) and a branch of the Tacoma Public Library. By 1920, even more room was needed and several buildings across the alley (Court C) were purchased and connected to the main store by a sky bridge. Further additions included a discount annex in 1935, a new men's shop in 1937 and a special vault that could hold 5,000 coats. In 1957, the company opened its first suburban location at the Villa Plaza Shopping Center in Lakewood, Washington.Malls of America: Villa Plaza Shopping Center Rhodes also operated a department store in University Village in Seattle in the 1960s. At one time there were signs on highways in Washington that said, \\"All roads lead to Rhodes,\\" giving the number of miles to the Rhodes store in Tacoma.South Sound Photo Album: Rhodes Brothers Department Store downtown Tacoma In the early 1950s, Rhodes was acquired by Western Department Stores, Inc., which also owned Kahn's of Oakland, CA, and Olds & King of Portland. Western took on the Rhodes name, becoming Rhodes Western, and by 1960 all stores were brought under the Rhodes name. In 1969, Rhodes Western was acquired by Amfac which owned the Liberty House chain of department stores and took on that name. Liberty House opened a location in Tacoma Mall in 1973, where Rhodes Western had been considering opening a location before they were bought out. The downtown Tacoma Rhodes store was closed in December 1974, and the Lakewood and Tacoma Mall locations were sold to Frederick & Nelson in 1979. Threatened with demolition, the downtown Tacoma location was bought and renovated by the University of Puget Sound in 1978 for use as a law school. After the building was vacated by the University of Puget Sound in 1999, it was purchased by the State of Washington and was renovated further in 2001. Now known as the Rhodes Center, the building is mostly vacant today, housing rentable conference space, several state offices and a law firm. Rhodes Seattle Albert Rhodes left Rhodes Brothers in 1907 and moved to Seattle, where he established the Rhodes Department Store. By 1926, it anchored the corner of Second Avenue and Union Streets in the downtown retail core. The store, which by then had several suburban branches, was purchased in 1968 by the Pay 'n Save corporation, who promptly shuttered its downtown store and re-branded the rest under a newly created moniker: Lamonts.

It was the center of Washington County government for over a century, from the building's completion in 1870 until 1975. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture and government/politics. It was nominated as Minnesota's oldest functioning courthouse and one of its few surviving examples of monumental public architecture from the mid-19th century. History The west side of the building in 2018 The courthouse was designed by Augustus Knight of St. Paul, in the Italianate style. When the courthouse opened in 1870, the county was doing a booming business in the lumber industry. The courthouse reflected the county's wealth and overlooked the city from atop Zion's Hill. The foundation is built of limestone, and the building has a brick facade and is topped with a prominent dome, cupola, and flagpole. When the county offices were moved to the new Washington County Government Center in 1975, efforts began to reuse the structure. Restoration has been funded through donations from local businesses and community groups, as well as grants from foundations. The historic courthouse is still in operation and serves as a gathering place and as a venue for community, cultural, and private events. The mission statement states, \\"The purpose of the operation of the Washington County Historic Courthouse is to preserve, re-adapt, restore and interpret this historic landmark for current and future generations, especially those from Washington County.\\" To this end, the county works with local groups to preserve and maintain the courthouse and grounds, conducts tours and provides historic interpretation of the county's heritage. The facility is also available for rental, which offsets some of the expenses of maintaining the structure.

Le Roy (September 30, 1943 ‚Äì August 10, 2018) was one of Canada's leading chemists who held the distinguished title of \\"University Professor\\" at the University of Waterloo. Le Roy attended Allenby Public school in North Toronto up to grade 8 and North Toronto Collegiate Institute until 1961. He then received the BSc and MSc degrees from University of Toronto in 1965 and 1967, respectively, and a PhD degree from University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1971. Le Roy is renowned for two major achievements in the field of chemistry: the development of the Leroy-Bernstein theory, alongside R. B. Bernstein, and the derivation of the LeRoy Radius. Le Roy is also the author of many computer programs that aid in collecting information from experiments. Many of his works are used by schools and labs throughout the world and have contributed to the progress of science. He was a graduate from the University of Toronto. During his stay there, he began working with theoretical and computational chemical physics, which is what he would deal with for the rest of his career. In his research, Le Roy used quantum mechanical theory to understand and explain how properties of molecular systems are the results of forces of interaction by quantitatively determining those forces from measurements of various properties. In almost any area of science, the experimental work ran parallel to the theoretical work and there was constant interplay between the two areas. Le Roy‚Äôs interest was in intermolecular forces. He used quantum mechanics and computer models to define and analyze the basic forces between atoms and molecules. Early in his career, Le Roy developed a technique for mathematically defining a radius of a small molecule, now known as the Le Roy radius. This established a boundary. Within the boundary, intra-molecular bonding is important, and beyond the boundary, inter-molecular forces predominate. In his work, the study of atomic and molecular spectra (called spectroscopy) played a crucial role. Measurements from spectroscopy help theoreticians develop better models and theories for explaining molecular structure. Computer programs that Le Roy developed for the purpose of converting experimental evidence to information on forces, shape, and structure are free, and are now routinely used around the world. It is important not to assume that forces and structures are well established. Our knowledge of bonding and structure becomes more and more scanty and unreliable for larger structures. A huge amount of research remains to be done if we are ever to be able to describe bonding and structure very accurately for even microscopic amounts of complex substances. Le Roy stated ‚Äú... except for the simplest systems, our knowledge of (interactions between molecules) is fairly primitive... .‚Äù A classic example is our understanding of the structure and activity of proteins‚Äîthe stuff of life. We know the composition of many proteins quite precisely and the structure can be experimentally determined, but the structure of these large molecules depends on how bonding folds and shapes the chains and branches. How a protein behaves and what it does depends specifically on its precise shape and structure, and that is something scientists often state is ‚Äúnot well understood.‚Äù His work on the Morse/Long- range potential with his former student Nike Dattani of Oxford University was referred to as a \\"landmark in diatomic spectral analysis\\" in. In the landmark work, the C3 value for atomic lithium was determined to a higher-precision than any atom's previously measured oscillator strength, by an order of magnitude. This lithium oscillator strength is related to the radiative lifetime of atomic lithium and is used as a benchmark for atomic clocks and measurements of fundamental constants.

It is a revision and expansion of Shirley's earlier morality play A Contention for Honor and Riches (c. 1630, printed 1633), and illustrates the persistence of influence of archaic forms of drama through the final phase of English Renaissance theatre.Potter, Louis. \\"Better (very) late than never\\", Times Literary Supplement. 29 November 2013. Synopsis The Lady Honoria has three suitors for her hand in marriage: Alamode, a courtier; Alworth, a scholar; and Conquest, a colonel. Lady Aurelia Mammon -- \\"widow / To the late high treasurer, Sir Omnipotent Mammon\\" -- has two suitors of her own, a wealthy Londoner named Fulbank and a countryman called Maslin. Honoria introduces Alworth to Mammon, but she dismisses him as beneath her consideration. Alamode and Conquest fight a duel over Honoria; Conquest wins, disarming Alamode and knocking him down. Maslin and Fulbank similarly quarrel over Mammon, though mutual cowardice saves them from serious fighting. Lady Mammon's gentleman usher, a demon called Phantasm (the Vice in the earlier version), helps Fulbank to win his Lady's hand; Phantasm then tempts a lawyer named Traverse to steal Mammon from Fulbank. Traverse succeeds in this -- but then Alamode wins her from Traverse and takes Mammon to his country house. Once in the country, though, Alamode is supplanted by Maslin, who in turn is displaced by Conquest. Meanwhile, Honoria has chosen Alworth over his competitors. She tests him, pretending she has changed her mind; and from his response, she judges him worthy of her. After the strain of the trial, however, Alworth faints, and a physician is called. The lawyer Traverse, who is tempted by Honoria's availability as well as Mammon's, masquerades as a doctor treating Alworth; he tells Honoria that Alworth is dead, and when she faints, he carries her away to his own country house. Conquest then rescues Honoria from Traverse with a band of his soldiers. Alworth shows up, in disguise; yet when he reveals himself to Honoria, Conquest recognizes him and takes him prisoner. Phantasm reveals his demon nature to Lady Mammon, and deserts her; sobered, she accepts Conquest as her husband, and he gives up Honoria to Alworth. The suitors who have lost out console themselves as best they can.

The play was never acted professionally-- though it is possible that the drama may have been designed \\"for the schoolboys Shirley taught after the closing of the theatres\\" in 1642.Logan and Smith, p. 166. The play was first printed in 1659, in an octavo volume issued by the bookseller John Crook that also contains Shirley's The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses. In that edition, Honoria and Mammon bears a dedication by Shirley \\"To the Candid Reader.\\" The scene of the play is identified as \\"Metropolis, or New-Troy.\\" The play received its professional premiere on Thursday 21 November 2013 at St Giles in the Fields, where Shirley was buried, in a production by Brice Stratford (who also took the part of Traverse, the lawyer) as part of the Owle Schreame theatre company's Cannibal Valour Rep Season of obscure classical productions.Kirwan, Peter Honoria and Mammon Review Bardathon, University of Nottingham. 28 October 2013 Notes References * Forsythe, Robert Stanley.

This was Poland's debut at the contest, and consequently the first time that the Polish language had been used in a contest entry. The song achieved second place in the Eurovision final - at the time the highest ever placing attained by a debut song (even in the first contest, Switzerland won with their second song of the night). It was released as a single in English as \\"Once in a Lifetime\\".  Overview  = Eurovision = The song is a dramatic ballad, with G√≥rniak describing herself as having an \\"easy world\\" - seemingly one of easy distinctions between good and bad. She sings that she is not Eve, referring to the Biblical character, and asking for her listener not to blame her for the sins of that figure. The result stood as the most successful first-time entry in contest history until the ballad \\"Molitva\\" performed by Serbian Marija ≈†erifoviƒá went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest 2007; Serbia's first entry as an independent state. Serbia and Montenegro's entry in the 2004 contest also placed second. At the same contest, Hungarian entrant Friderika, making her country's d√©but with \\"Kinek mondjam el v√©tkeimet?\\" placed fourth, presaging the domination of the contest by Eastern and Central European performers in subsequent years. G√≥rniak was threatened with disqualification after singing the second half of the song in English during the dress rehearsal watched by the national jury members. An English-language version was later recorded, titled \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", and featuring G√≥rniak telling her lover that their relationship is a \\"once in a lifetime\\" event. The song was performed twenty-fourth on the night, following Russia's Youddiph with \\"Vyechniy stranik\\" and preceding France's Nina Morato with \\"Je suis un vrai gar√ßon\\". At the close of voting, it had received 166 points, placing second in a field of twenty five.

It was Gorniak's debut release and featured on her debut album Dotyk. The music for the song was written by Stanis≈Çaw Syrewicz. The Polish lyrics were written by Jacek Cygan and the English lyrics by Graham Sacher. Both versions appear on the single. The single cover includes pictures by photographer Marlena Bieli≈Ñska.

K. Narayan. It was adapted into the films Mr. Sampat (Hindi, 1952) and a Tamil film sharing the same title (1972). A comic realist novel of manners, Mr. Sampath marks the first of three Narayan novels that take an external approach, focusing on events outside the protagonist, in contrast to Narayan's more internally- focused earlier novels. The novel is set in 1938 under the British Raj, in the fictional town of Malgudi. Plot The novel is made up of two parts: a first part dealing with the publication of a newspaper and centered on Mr. Sampath, and a second part focus on movie production and centered on Mr. Srinivas. In the first part, to bring out the journal The Banner, Mr. Srinivas, the editor, and Mr. Sampath, the printer, have to work together. The two entirely contrasting good-hearted characters forge a great partnership that makes The Banner the center of attention in Malgudi. However, a situation arises and they have to temporarily discontinue the journal. In the second part, Srinivas and Sampath join hands with a film-making company where they have to trace varying paths, with their special bond still very deep. A love affair with the actress of the movie makes life difficult for the daring and over-ambitious Sampath, while the ethical Srinivas has his problems of over-responsibility. Some sour incidents in the studio force Srinivas to quit and revive his Banner with another printer, a thing that doesn't seem to bother Sampath caught entirely in the charm of the heroine.

In addition to the new user interface, security capabilities, and developer technologies, several major components of the core operating system were redesigned, most notably the audio, print, display, and networking subsystems; while the results of this work will be visible to software developers, end-users will only see what appear to be evolutionary changes in the user interface. As part of the redesign of the networking architecture, IPv6 has been incorporated into the operating system, and a number of performance improvements have been introduced, such as TCP window scaling. Prior versions of Windows typically needed third-party wireless networking software to work properly; this is no longer the case with Windows Vista, as it includes comprehensive wireless networking support. For graphics, Windows Vista introduces a new as well as major revisions to Direct3D. The new display driver model facilitates the new Desktop Window Manager, which provides the tearing-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of the Windows Aero graphical user interface. The new display driver model is also able to offload rudimentary tasks to the GPU, allow users to install drivers without requiring a system reboot, and seamlessly recover from rare driver errors due to illegal application behavior. At the core of the operating system, many improvements have been made to the memory manager, process scheduler, heap manager, and I/O scheduler. A Kernel Transaction Manager has been implemented that can be used by data persistence services to enable atomic transactions. The service is being used to give applications the ability to work with the file system and registry using atomic transaction operations. Audio Windows Vista features a completely re-written audio stack designed to provide low-latency 32-bit floating point audio, higher- quality digital signal processing, bit-for-bit sample level accuracy, up to 144 dB of dynamic range and new audio APIs created by a team including Steve Ball and Larry Osterman. The new audio stack runs at user level, thus increasing stability. The Windows Vista audio engine is designed to run faster than the Windows XP audio engine, and has tighter requirements on audio buffer position accuracy. Also, the new Universal Audio Architecture (UAA) model has been introduced, replacing WDM audio, which allows compliant audio hardware to automatically work under Windows without needing device drivers from the audio hardware vendor. There are three major APIs in the Windows Vista audio architecture: * Windows Audio Session API ‚Äì Very low-level API for rendering audio, render/capture audio streams, adjust volume etc. This API also provides low latency for audio professionals through WaveRT (wave real-time) port driver.MSDN - A Wave Port Driver for Real-Time Audio Streaming * Multimedia Device API ‚Äì For enumerating and managing audio endpoints. * Device Topology API ‚Äì For discovering the internals of an audio card's topology. =Audio stack architecture= Applications communicate with the audio driver through Sessions, and these Sessions are programmed through the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI). In general, WASAPI operates in two modes. In exclusive mode (also called DMA mode), unmixed audio streams are rendered directly to the audio adapter and no other application's audio will play and signal processing has no effect. Exclusive mode is useful for applications that demand the least amount of intermediate processing of the audio data or those that want to output compressed audio data such as Dolby Digital, DTS or WMA Pro over S/PDIF. WASAPI exclusive mode is similar to kernel streaming in function, but no kernel mode programming is required. In shared mode, audio streams are rendered by the application and optionally applied per-stream audio effects known as Local Effects (LFX) (such as per-session volume control). Then the streams are mixed by the global audio engine, where a set of global audio effects (GFX) may be applied. Finally, they're rendered on the audio device. The higher level APIs such as the Waveform-Audio Interface (waveXxx functions) and DirectSound use shared mode, which results in pre-mixed PCM audio that is sent to the driver in a single format (in terms of sample rate, bit depth and channel count). This format is configurable by the end user through Control Panel. After passing through WASAPI, all host-based audio processing, including custom audio processing, can take place (sample rate conversion, mixing, effects). Host-based processing modules are referred to as Audio Processing Objects, or APOs. All these components operate in user mode. The only portion of this architecture that runs in kernel mode is the audio driver (which contains the Port Class driver, the vendor Miniport driver and the vendor HAL). The Windows Kernel Mixer (KMixer) is completely gone. There is no direct path from DirectSound to the audio drivers; DirectSound and MME are emulated as Session instances. Since the whole point of DirectSound acceleration is to allow hardware to process unmixed audio content, DirectSound cannot be accelerated in this audio model, and DirectSound3D is not supported at all, which also breaks EAX extensions.Creative Technology - Support - Audio in Windows Vista APIs such as ASIO and OpenAL are not affected. =Audio performance= Windows Vista also includes a new Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS) that allows multimedia applications to register their time-critical processing to run at an elevated thread priority, thus ensuring prioritized access to CPU resources for time-sensitive DSP processing and mixing tasks. For audio professionals, a new WaveRT port driver has been introduced that strives to achieve real-time performance by using the multimedia class scheduler and supports audio applications that reduce the latency of audio streams. Consequently, user mode applications can completely govern streams of audio without any code execution in the kernel during runtime. WaveRT allows the user mode application direct access to the internal audio hardware buffers and sample position counters (data in the memory that is mapped to the audio hardware DMA engine). It allows applications to poll the current position in the DMA memory window that the hardware is accessing. WaveRT also supports the notion of a hardware generated clock notification event, similar to the ASIO API, so that applications need not poll for current position if they don't want to. All the existing audio APIs have been re- plumbed and emulated to use these APIs internally, all audio goes through these three APIs, so that most applications \\"just work\\". Issues A fault in the MME WaveIn/WaveOut emulation was introduced in Windows Vista: if sample rate conversion is needed, audible noise is sometimes introduced, such as when playing audio in a web browser that uses these APIs. This is because the internal resampler, which is no longer configurable, defaults to linear interpolation, which was the lowest-quality conversion mode that could be set in previous versions of Windows. The resampler can be set to a high-quality mode via a hotfix for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 only. =Audio signal processing= New digital signal processing functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers in a manner similar to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether there is a multi-channel or stereo sound system in a home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate the speakers for that room. By placing a microphone where the listener plans to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function. Windows Vista also includes the ability to use custom host-based digital signal processing effects as part of the audio device manufacturer-supplied driver's value-added features. These effects are packaged as user-mode System Effect Audio Processing Objects (sAPOs).Custom Audio Effects in Windows Vista These sAPOs are also reusable by third-party software. =Audio devices support= Windows Vista builds on the Universal Audio Architecture, a new class driver definition that aims to reduce the need for third-party drivers, and to increase the overall stability and reliability of audio in Windows. * Support for Intel High Definition Audio devices (which replaces Intel's previous AC'97 audio hardware standard) * Extended support for USB audio devices: ** Built-in decoding of padded AC-3 (Dolby Digital), MP3, WMA and WMA Pro streams and outputting as S/PDIF. ** Support for MIDI \\"Elements\\".See the USB Midi Devices 1.0 standard document for more information on MIDI Elements. ** New support for asynchronous endpoints.See section 3.3 of the USB Audio Devices 1.0 standard document for more information on endpoint types. * IEEE 1394 (aka FireWire) audio support was slated for a future release of Windows Vista, to be implemented as a full class driver, automatically supporting IEEE 1394 AV/C audio devices. * Support for audio jack sensing which can detect the audio devices that are plugged into the various audio jacks on a device and inform the user about their configuration. * Endpoint Discovery and Abstraction: Audio devices are expressed in terms of audio endpoints such as microphones, speakers, headphones. For example, each recording input (Microphone, Line in etc.) is treated as a separate device, which allows recording from both at the same time. =Other audio enhancements= * A new set of user interface sounds have been introduced, including a new startup sound created with the help of King Crimson's Robert Fripp. The new sounds are intended to complement the Windows Aero graphical user interface, with the new startup sound consisting of two parallel melodies that are played in an intentional \\"Win-dows Vis-ta\\" rhythm. According to Jim Allchin, the new sounds are intended to be gentler and softer than the sounds used in previous versions of Windows. * Windows Vista also allows controlling system-wide volume or volume of individual audio devices and individual applications separately. This feature can be used from the new Volume Control windows or programmatically using the overhauled audio API. Different sounds can be redirected to different audio devices as well. * Windows Vista includes integrated microphone array support which is intended to increase the accuracy of the speech recognition feature and allow a user to connect multiple microphones to a system so that the inputs can be combined into a single, higher-quality source. Microsoft has also included a new high quality voice capture DirectX Media Object (DMO) as part of DirectShow that allows voice capture applications such as instant messengers and speech recognition applications to apply Acoustic Echo Cancellation and microphone array processing to speech signals. =Speech recognition= Windows Speech Recognition tutorial Windows Vista is the first Windows operating system to include fully integrated support for speech recognition. Under Windows 2000 and XP, Speech Recognition was installed with Office 2003, or was included in Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Windows Speech Recognition allows users to control their machine through voice commands, and enables dictation into many applications. The application has a fairly high recognition accuracy and provides a set of commands that assists in dictation. A brief speech-driven tutorial is included to help familiarize a user with speech recognition commands. Training could also be completed to improve the accuracy of speech recognition. Windows Vista includes speech recognition for 8 languages at release time: English (U.S. and British), Spanish, German, French, Japanese and Chinese (traditional and simplified). Support for additional languages is planned for post-release. Speech recognition in Vista utilizes version 5.3 of the Microsoft Speech API Windows Vista, SAPI Talking Windows . (SAPI) and version 8 of the Speech Recognizer. =Speech synthesis= Speech synthesis was first introduced in Windows with Windows 2000, but it has been significantly enhanced for Windows Vista (code name Mulan). The old voice, Microsoft Sam, has been replaced with two new, more natural sounding voices of generally greater intelligibility: Anna and Lili, the latter of which is capable of speaking Chinese. The screen-reader Narrator which uses these voices has also been updated. Microsoft Agent and other text to speech applications now use the newer SAPI 5 voices.Vista Speech Demo from the Professional Developers Conference 2005 (link requires Internet Explorer) Print Windows Vista includes a redesigned print architecture, built around Windows Presentation Foundation. It provides high-fidelity color printing through improved use of color management, removes limitations of the current GDI-based print subsystem, enhances support for printing advanced effects such as gradients, transparencies, etc., and for color laser printers through the use of XML Paper Specification (XPS). The print subsystem in Windows Vista implements the new XPS print path as well as the legacy GDI print path for legacy support. Windows Vista transparently makes use of the XPS print path for those printers that support it, otherwise using the GDI print path. On documents with intensive graphics, XPS printers are expected to produce much greater quality prints than GDI printers. In a networked environment with a print server running Windows Vista, documents will be rendered on the client machine,Client Side Rendering rather than on the server, using a feature known as Client Side Rendering. The rendered intermediate form will just be transferred to the server to be printed without additional processing, making print servers more scalable by offloading rendering computation to clients. =XPS print path= The XPS Print Path introduced in Windows Vista supports high quality 16-bit color printing.16 bits and more printing on Windows The XPS print path uses XML Paper Specification (XPS) as the print spooler file format, that serves as the page description language (PDL) for printers. The XPS spooler format is the intended replacement for the Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format which is the print spooler format in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) print path.XPS and Color Printing Enhancements in Microsoft Windows Vista XPS is an XML-based (more specifically XAML-based) color-managed device and resolution independent vector-based paged document format which encapsulates an exact representation of the actual printed output. XPS documents are packed in a ZIP container along with text, fonts, raster images, 2D vector graphics and DRM information. For printers supporting XPS, this eliminates an intermediate conversion to a printer-specific language, increasing the reliability and fidelity of the printed output. Microsoft claims that major printer vendors are planning to release printers with built- in XPS support and that this will provide better fidelity to the original document. At the core of the XPS print path is XPSDrv, the XPS-based printer driver which includes the filter pipeline. It contains a set of filters which are print processing modules and an XML-based configuration file to describe how the filters are loaded. Filters receive the spool file data as input, perform document processing, rendering and PDL post-processing, and then output PDL data for the printer to consume. Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert the spool file to the page description language supported by the printer. Windows Vista also provides improved color support through the Windows Color System for higher color precision and dynamic range. It also supports CMYK colorspace and multiple ink systems for higher print fidelity. The print subsystem also has support for named colors simplifying color definition for images transmitted to printer supporting those colors. The XPS print path can automatically calibrate color profile settings with those being used by the display subsystem. Conversely, XPS print drivers can express the configurable capabilities of the printer, by virtue of the XPS PrintCapabilities class, to enable more fine-grained control of print settings, tuned to the individual printing device. Applications which use the Windows Presentation Foundation for the display elements can directly print to the XPS print path without the need for image or colorspace conversion. The XPS format used in the spool file, represents advanced graphics effects such as 3D images, glow effects, and gradients as Windows Presentation Foundation primitives, which are processed by the printer drivers without rasterization, preventing rendering artifacts and reducing computational load. When the legacy GDI Print Path is used, the XPS spool file is used for processing before it is converted to a GDI image to minimize the processing done at raster level. =Print schemas= Print schemas provide an XML-based format for expressing and organizing a large set of properties that describe either a job format or print capabilities in a hierarchically structured manner. Print schemas are intended to address the problems associated with internal communication between the components of the print subsystem, and external communication between the print subsystem and applications. Networking The Network and Sharing Center Windows Vista contains a new networking stack, which brings large improvements in all areas of network-related functionality. It includes a native implementation of IPv6, as well as complete overhaul of IPv4. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components, services, and the user interface. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol to resolve names of local hosts on a network which does not have a DNS server running. The new TCP/IP stack uses a new method to store configuration settings that enables more dynamic control and does not require a computer restart after settings are changed. The new stack is also based on a strong host model and features an infrastructure to enable more modular components that can be dynamically inserted and removed. The user interface for configuring, troubleshooting and working with network connections has changed significantly from prior versions of Windows as well. Users can make use of the new \\"Network Center\\" to see the status of their network connections, and to access every aspect of configuration. The network can be browsed using Network Explorer, which replaces Windows XP's \\"My Network Places\\". Network Explorer items can be a shared device such as a scanner, or a file share. Network Location Awareness uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type. Windows Vista graphically presents how different devices are connected over a network in the Network Map view, using the LLTD protocol. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and media type (wired or wireless). Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's user interface. When LLTD is invoked, it provides metadata about the device that contains static or state information, such as the MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 address, signal strength etc. Support for wireless networks is built into the network stack itself, and does not emulate wired connections, as was the case with previous versions of Windows. This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Windows Vista uses various techniques like Receive Window Auto-scaling, Explicit Congestion Notification, TCP Chimney offload and Compound TCP to improve networking performance. Quality of Service (QoS) policies can be used to prioritize network traffic, with traffic shaping available to all applications, even those that do not explicitly use QoS APIs. Windows Vista includes in-built support for peer-to-peer networks and SMB 2.0. For improved network security, Windows Vista supports for 256-bit and 384-bit Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithms, as well as for 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is included in the network stack itself, while integrating IPsec with Windows Firewall. Kernel and core OS changes * The new Kernel Transaction Manager enables atomic transaction operations across different types of objects, most significantly file system and registry operations. * The memory manager and processes scheduler have been improved. The scheduler was modified to use the cycle counter register of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many CPU cycles a thread has executed, rather than just using an interval-timer interrupt routine.Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 1, Microsoft Technet This new CPU cycle-based thread scheduling gives a greater fairness and more deterministic app behavior.Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part I Many kernel data structures and algorithms have been rewritten. Lookup algorithms now run in constant time, instead of linear time as with previous versions. * Windows Vista includes support for condition variables and reader-writer locks. * Process creation overhead is reduced by significant improvements to DLL address- resolving schemes. * Windows Vista introduces a Protected Process,Protected Processes in Windows Vista which differs from usual processes in the sense that other processes cannot manipulate the state of such a process, nor can threads from other processes be introduced in it. A Protected Process has enhanced access to DRM-functions of Windows Vista. However, currently, only the applications using Protected Video Path can create Protected Processes. * Thread Pools have been upgraded to support multiple pools per process, as well as to reduce performance overhead using thread recycling. It also includes Cleanup Groups that allow cleanup of pending thread-pool requests on process shutdown. * Threaded DPC , conversely to an ordinary DPC (Deferred Procedure Call), decreases the system latency improving the performance of time- sensitive applications, such as audio or video playback. * Data Redirection: Also known as data virtualization, this virtualizes the registry and certain parts of the file system for applications running in the protected user context if User Account Control is turned on, enabling legacy applications to run in non-administrator accounts. It automatically creates private copies of files that an application can use when it does not have permission to access the original files. This facilitates stronger file security and helps applications not written with the least user access principle in mind to run under stronger restrictions. Registry virtualization isolates write operations that have a global impact to a per-user location. Reads and writes in the \`HKLM\\\\Software\` section of the Registry by user-mode applications while running as a standard user, as well as to folders such as \\"Program Files\\", are \\"redirected\\" to the user's profile. The process of reading and writing on the profile data and not on the application-intended location is completely transparent to the application. * Windows Vista supports the PCI Express 1.1 specification, including extended configuration space and segmentation. PCI Express registers, including capability registers, are supported, along with save and restore of configuration data. * Native support and generic driver for Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) specification for Serial ATA drives, SATA Native Command Queuing, Hot plugging, and AHCI Link Power Management. * Full support for the ACPI 2.0 specification, and parts of ACPI 3.0.Windows NT 6.x Kernel Changes. (Word document) Support for throttling power usage of individual devices has been improved. * Kernel-mode Plug-And- Play enhancements include support for PCI multilevel rebalance, partial arbitration of resources to support PCI subtractive bridges, asynchronous device start and enumeration operations to speed system startup, support for setting and retrieving custom properties on a device, an enhanced ejection API to allow the caller to determine if and when a device has been successfully ejected, and diagnostic tracing to facilitate improved reliability. * The startup process for Windows Vista has changed completely in comparison to earlier versions of Windows. The NTLDR boot loader has been replaced by a more flexible system, with NTLDR's functionality split between two new components: winload.exe and Windows Boot Manager.See Boot Configuration Data Editor Frequently Asked Questions for details on BCD. A notable change is that the Windows Boot Manager is invoked by pressing the space bar instead of the F8 function key.The space bar is the new F8 when it comes to Vista and Server 2008 boot options The F8 key still remains assigned for advanced boot options once the Windows Boot Manager menu appears. * On UEFI systems, beginning with Windows Vista Service Pack 1, the x64 version of Windows Vista has the ability to boot from a disk with a GUID Partition Table. * Windows Vista includes a completely overhauled and rewritten Event logging subsystem, known as Windows Event Log which is XML-based and allows applications to more precisely log events, offers better views, filtering and categorization by criteria, automatic log forwarding, centrally logging and managing events from a single computer and remote access. * Windows Vista includes an overhauled Task Scheduler that uses hierarchical folders of tasks. The Task Scheduler can run programs, send email, or display a message. The Task Scheduler can also now be triggered by an XPath expression for filtering events from the Windows Event Log, and can respond to a workstation's lock or unlock, and as well as the connection or disconnection to the machine from a Remote Desktop. The Task Scheduler tasks can be scripted in VBScript, JScript, or PowerShell. * Restart Manager: The Restart Manager works with Microsoft's update tools and websites to detect processes that have files in use and to gracefully stop and restart services to reduce the number of reboots required after applying updates as far as possible for higher levels of the software stack. Kernel updates, logically, still require the system to be restarted. In addition, the Restart Manager provides a mechanism for applications to stop and then restart programs. Applications that are written specifically to take advantage of the new Restart Manager features using the API can be restarted and restored to the same state and with the same data as before the restart. Using the Application Recovery and Restart APIs in conjunction with the Restart Manager enables applications to control what actions are taken on their behalf by the system when they fail or crash such as recovering unsaved data or documents, restarting the application, and diagnosing and reporting the problem using Windows Error Reporting. * When shutting down or restarting Windows, previous Windows versions either forcibly terminated applications after waiting for few seconds, or allowed applications to entirely cancel shutdown without informing the user. Windows Vista now informs the user in a full-screen interface if there are running applications when exiting Windows or allows continuing with or cancelling the initiated shutdown. The reason registered, if any, for cancelling a shutdown by an application using the new ShutdownBlockReasonCreate API is also displayed.Shutdown Changes for Windows Vista and Handling OS shutdown in Windows Vista * Clean service shutdown: Services in Windows Vista have the capability of delaying the system shutdown in order to properly flush data and finish current operations. If the service stops responding, the system terminates it after 3 minutes. Crashes and restart problems are drastically reduced since the Service Control Manager is not terminated by a forced shutdown anymore. =Boot process= Windows Vista introduces an overhaul of the previous Windows NT operating system loader architecture NTLDR. Used by versions of Windows NT since its inception with Windows NT 3.1, NTLDR has been completely replaced with a new architecture designed to address modern firmware technologies such as the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. The new architecture introduces a firmware- independent data store and is backward compatible with previous versions of the Windows operating system. =Memory management= * Windows Vista features a Dynamic System Address Space that allocates virtual memory and kernel page tables on-demand. It also supports very large registry sizes. * Includes enhanced support for Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) and systems with large memory pages. Windows Vista also exposes APIs for accessing the NUMA features. * Memory pages can be marked as read-only, to prevent data corruption. * New address mapping scheme called Rotate Virtual Address Descriptors (VAD). It is used for the advanced Video subsystem. * Swapping in of memory pages and system cache include prefetching and clustering, to improve performance. * Performance of Address Translation Buffers has been enhanced. * Heap layout has been modified to provide higher performance on 64-bit and Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems. The new heap structure is also more scalable and has low management overhead, especially for large heaps. * Windows Vista automatically tunes up the heap layout for improved fragmentation management. The Low Fragmentation Heap (LFH) is enabled by default.Low-fragmentation Heap: Heap functions - MSDN * Lazy initialization of heap initializes only when required, to improve performance. * The Windows Vista memory manager does not have a 64 kb read-ahead cache limitation unlike previous versions of Windows and can thus improve file system performance dramatically. =File systems= * Transactional NTFS allows multiple file/folder operations to be treated as a single operation, so that a crash or power failure won't result in half- completed file writes. Transactions can also be extended to multiple machines. * Image Mastering API (IMAPI v2) enables DVD burning support for applications, in addition to CD burning. IMAPI v2 supports multiple optical drives, even recording to multiple drives simultaneously, unlike IMAPI in Windows XP which only supported recording with one optical drive at a time. In addition, multiple filesystems are supported. Applications using IMAPI v2 can create, and burn disc images‚Äîit is extensible in the sense that developers can write their own specific media formats and create their own file systems for its programming interfaces. IMAPI v2 is implemented as a DLL rather than as a service as was the case in Windows XP,IMAPI 2.0 is a DLL, not a Windows service and is also scriptable using VBScript. IMAPI v2 is also available for Windows XP. With the Windows Feature Pack for Storage installed, IMAPI 2.0 supports Recordable Blu-ray Disc (BD-R) and Rewritable Blu-ray Disc (BD-RE) media as well. Windows DVD Maker can burn DVD-Video discs, while Windows Explorer can burn data on DVDs (DVD¬±R, DVD¬±R DL, DVD¬±R RW) in addition to DVD- RAM and CDs. * Live File System: A writable UDF file system. The Windows UDF file system (UDFS) implementation was read-only in OS releases prior to Windows Vista. In Windows Vista, Packet writing (incremental writing) is supported by UDFS, which can now format and write to all mainstream optical media formats (MO, CDR/RW, DVD+R/RW, DVD-R/RW/RAM). Write support is included for UDF format versions up to and including 2.50, with read support up to 2.60. UDF symbolic links, however, are not supported. * Common Log File System (CLFS) API provides a high-performance, general-purpose log-file subsystem that dedicated user-mode and kernel-mode client applications can use and multiple clients can share to optimize log access and for data and event management. * File encryption support superior to that available in Encrypting File System in Windows XP, which will make it easier and more automatic to prevent unauthorized viewing of files on stolen laptops or hard drives. * File System Mini Filters model which are kernel mode non-device drivers, to monitor filesystem activity, have been upgraded in Windows Vista. The Registry filtering model adds support for redirecting calls and modifying parameters and introduces the concept of altitudes for filter registrations. * Registry notification hooks, introduced in Windows XP, and recently enhanced in Windows Vista, allow software to participate in registry related activities in the system. * Support of UNIX-style symbolic links. Previous Windows versions had support for a type of cross-volume reparse points known as junction points and hard links. However, junction points could be created only for directories and stored absolute paths, whereas hardlinks could be created for files but were not cross-volume. NTFS symbolic links can be created for any object and are cross-volume, cross-host (work over UNC paths), and store relative paths. However, the cross-host functionality of symbolic links does not work over the network with previous versions of Windows or other operating systems, only with computers running Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system. Symbolic links can be created, modified and deleted using the Mklink utility which is included with Windows Vista. Microsoft has published some developer documentation on symbolic links in the MSDN documentation. In addition, Windows Explorer is now symbolic link-aware and deleting a symbolic link from Explorer just deletes the link itself and not the target object. Explorer also shows the symbolic link target in the object's properties and shows a shortcut icon overlay on a junction point. * A new tab, \\"Previous Versions\\", in the Properties dialog for any file or folder, provides read-only snapshots of files on local or network volumes from an earlier point in time. This feature is based on the Volume Shadow Copy technology. * A new file-based disk image format called Windows Imaging Format (WIM), which can be mounted as a partition, or booted from. An associated tool called ImageX provides facilities to create and maintain these image files. * Self-healing NTFS: In previous Windows versions, NTFS marked the volume \\"dirty\\" upon detecting file- system corruption and CHKDSK was required to be run by taking the volume \\"offline\\". With self-healing NTFS, an NTFS worker thread is spawned in the background which performs a localized fix-up of damaged data structures, with only the corrupted files/folders remaining unavailable without locking out the entire volume. The self-healing behavior can be turned on for a volume with the fsutil repair set C: 1 command where C presents the volume letter. * New /B switch in CHKDSK for NTFS volumes which clears marked bad sectors on a volume and reevaluates them. * Windows Vista has support for hard disk drives with large physical sector sizes (> 512 bytes per sector drives) if the drive supports 512-bytes logical sectors / emulation (called Advanced Format/512E). Drives with both 4k logical and 4k physical sectors are not supported. * The NLS casing table in NTFS has been updated so that partitions formatted with Windows Vista will be able to see the proper behavior for the 100+ mappings that have been added to Unicode but were not added to Windows. * Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and later have built-in support for exFAT. =Drivers= Windows Vista introduces an improved driver model, Windows Driver Foundation which is an opt-in framework to replace the older Windows Driver Model. It includes: * Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), previously referred to as Longhorn Display Driver Model (LDDM), designed for graphics performance and stability. * A new Kernel-Mode Driver Framework, which will also be available for Windows XP and Windows 2000. * A new user-mode driver model called the User-Mode Driver Framework. In Windows Vista, WDDM display drivers have two components, a kernel mode driver (KMD) that is very streamlined, and a user- mode driver that does most of the intense computations. With this model, most of the code is moved out of kernel mode. The audio subsystem also runs largely in user-mode to prevent impacting negatively on kernel performance and stability. Also, printer drivers in kernel mode are not supported. User-mode drivers are not able to directly access the kernel but use it through a dedicated API. User-mode drivers are supported for devices which plug into a USB or FireWire bus, such as digital cameras, portable media players, PDAs, mobile phones and mass storage devices, as well as \\"non-hardware\\" drivers, such as filter drivers and other software-only drivers. This also allows for drivers which would typically require a system reboot (video card drivers, for example) to install or update without needing a reboot of the machine. If the driver requires access to kernel-mode resources, developers can split the driver so that part of it runs in kernel-mode and part of it runs in user- mode. These features are significant because a majority of system crashes can be traced to improperly installed or unstable third-party device drivers. If an error occurs the new framework allows for an immediate restart of the driver and does not impact the system. User-Mode Driver Framework is available for Windows XP and is included in Windows Media Player 11. * Kernel-mode drivers on 64-bit versions of Windows Vista must be digitally signed; even administrators will not be able to install unsigned kernel-mode drivers. A boot-time option is available to disable this check for a single session of Windows. Installing user-mode drivers will still work without a digital signature. * Signed drivers are required for usage of PUMA, PAP (Protected Audio Path), and PVP-OPM subsystems. * Driver packages that are used to install driver software are copied in their entirety into a \\"Driver Store\\", which is a repository of driver packages. This ensures that drivers that need to be repaired or reinstalled won't need to ask for source media to get \\"fresh\\" files. The Driver Store can also be preloaded with drivers by an OEM or IT administrator to ensure that commonly used devices (e.g. external peripherals shipped with a computer system, corporate printers) can be installed immediately. Adding, removing and viewing drivers from the \\"Driver Store\\" is done using \`PnPUtil.exe\`The staging and the installation of driver packages by using the PnP Utility (Pnputil.exe) in Windows Vista A new setting in Device Manager allows deleting the drivers from the Driver Store when uninstalling the hardware. * Support for Windows Error Reporting; information on an \\"unknown device\\" is reported to Microsoft when a driver cannot be found on the system, via Windows Update, or supplied by the user. OEMs can hook into this system to provide information that can be returned to the user, such as a formal statement of non-support of a device for Windows Vista, or a link to a web site with support information, drivers, etc. =Processor Power Management= Windows Vista includes the following changes and enhancements in processor power management: * Native operating system support for PPM on multiprocessor systems, including systems using processors with multiple logical threads, multiple cores, or multiple physical sockets. * Support for all ACPI 2.0 and 3.0 processor objects. * User configurable system cooling policy, minimum and maximum processor states. * Operating system coordination of performance state transitions between dependent processors. * Elimination of the processor dynamic throttling policies used in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. * More flexible use of the available range of processor performance states through system power policy. * The static use of any linear throttle state on systems that are not capable of processor performance states. * Exposure of multiple power policy parameters that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may tune to optimize Windows Vista use of PPM features. * In-box drivers for processors from all leading processor manufacturers. * A generic processor driver that allows the use of processor-specific controls for performance state transitions. * An improved C3 entry algorithm, where a failed C3 entry does not cause demotion to C2. * Removal of support for legacy processor performance state interfaces. * Removal of support for legacy mobile processor drivers. =System performance= * SuperFetch caches frequently- used applications and documents in memory, and keeps track of when commonly used applications are usually loaded, so that they can be pre-cached and it also prioritizes the programs currently used over background tasks. SuperFetch aims to negate the negative performance effect of having anti-virus or backup software run when the user is not at the computer. Superfetch is able to learn at what time of a given day an application is used and so it can be pre- cached. * ReadyBoost, makes PCs running Windows Vista more responsive by using flash memory on a USB drive (USB 2.0 only), SD Card, Compact Flash, or other form of flash memory, in order to boost system performance. When such a device is plugged in, the Windows Autoplay dialog offers an additional option to use it to speed up the system; an additional \\"ReadyBoost\\" tab is added to the drive's properties dialog where the amount of space to be used can be configured. * ReadyBoot uses an in-RAM cache to optimize the boot process if the system has 700MB or more memory. The size of the cache depends on the total RAM available, but is large enough to create a reasonable cache and yet allow the system the memory it needs to boot smoothly. ReadyBoot uses the same ReadyBoost service. * ReadyDrive is the name Microsoft has given to its support for hybrid drives, a new design of hard drive developed by Samsung and Microsoft. Hybrid drives incorporate non-volatile memory into the drive's design, resulting in lower power needs, as the drive's spindles do not need to be activated for every write operation. Windows Vista can also make use of the NVRAM to increase the speed of booting and returning from hibernation. * Windows Vista features Prioritized I/O which allows developers to set application I/O priorities for read/write disk operations, similar to how currently application processes/threads can be assigned CPU priorities. I/O has been enhanced with I/O asynchronous cancellation and I/O scheduling based on thread priority. Background applications running in low priority I/O do not disturb foreground applications. Applications like Windows Defender, Automatic Disk Defragmenter and Windows Desktop Search (during indexing) already use this feature. Windows Media Player 11 also supports this technology to offer glitch-free multimedia playback. * The Offline Files feature, which maintains a client-side cache of files shared over a network, has been significantly improved. When synchronizing the changes in the cached copy to the remote version, the Bitmap Differential Transfer protocol is used so that only the changed blocks in the cached version are transferred, but when retrieving changes from the remote copy, the entire file is downloaded. are synchronized on a per-share basis and encrypted on a per-user basis and users can force Windows to work in offline mode or online mode or sync manually from the Sync Center. The Sync Center can also report sync errors and resolve sync conflicts. Also, if network connectivity is restored, file handles are redirected to the remote share transparently. * Delayed service start allows services to start a short while after the system has finished booting and initial busy operations, so that the system boots up faster and performs tasks quicker than before. * Enable advanced performance option for hard disks: When enabled, the operating system may cache disk writes as well as disk reads. In previous Windows operating systems, only the disk's internal disk caching, if any, was utilised for disk write operations when the disk cache was enabled by the user. Enabling this option causes Windows to make use of its own local cache in addition to this, which speeds up performance, at the expense of a little more risk of data loss during a sudden loss of power. Programmability =.NET Framework 3.0= Windows Vista is the first client version of Windows to ship with the .NET Framework. Specifically, it includes .NET Framework 2.0 and .NET Framework 3.0 (previously known as WinFX) but not version 1.0 or 1.1. The .NET Framework is a set of managed code APIs that is slated to succeed Win32. The Win32 API is also present in Windows Vista, but does not give direct access to all the new functionality introduced with the .NET Framework. In addition, .NET Framework is intended to give programmers easier access to the functionality present in Windows itself. .NET Framework 3.0 includes APIs such as ADO.NET, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, among others, and adds four core frameworks to the .NET Framework: * Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) * Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) * Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) * Windows CardSpace WPF Windows Presentation Foundation (codenamed Avalon) is the overhaul of the graphical subsystem in Windows and the flagship resolution independent API for 2D and 3D graphics, raster and vector graphics (XAML), fixed and adaptive documents (XPS), advanced typography, animation (XAML), data binding, audio and video in Windows Vista. WPF enables richer control, design, and development of the visual aspects of Windows programs. Based on DirectX, it renders all graphics using Direct3D. Routing the graphics through Direct3D allows Windows to offload graphics tasks to the GPU, reducing the workload on the computer's CPU. This capability is used by the Desktop Window Manager to make the desktop, all windows and all other shell elements into 3D surfaces. WPF applications can be deployed on the desktop or hosted in a web browser (XBAP). The 3D capabilities in WPF are limited compared to what's available in Direct3D. However, WPF provides tighter integration with other features like user interface (UI), documents, and media. This makes it possible to have 3D UI, 3D documents, and 3D media. A set of built-in controls is provided as part of WPF, containing items such as button, menu, and list box controls. WPF provides the ability to perform control composition, where a control can contain any other control or layout. WPF also has a built-in set of data services to enable application developers to bind data to the controls. Images are supported using the Windows Imaging Component. For media, WPF supports any audio and video formats which Windows Media Player can play. In addition, WPF supports time-based animations, in contrast to the frame-based approach. This delinks the speed of the animation from how slow or fast the system is performing. Text is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType. WPF uses Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), which is a variant of XML, intended for use in developing user interfaces. Using XAML to develop user interfaces also allows for separation of model and view. In XAML, every element maps onto a class in the underlying API, and the attributes are set as properties on the instantiated classes. All elements of WPF may also be coded in a .NET language such as C#. The XAML code is ultimately compiled into a managed assembly in the same way all .NET languages are, which means that the use of XAML for development does not incur a performance cost. WCF Windows Communication Foundation (codenamed Indigo) is a new communication subsystem to enable applications, in one machine or across multiple machines connected by a network, to communicate. WCF programming model unifies Web Services, .NET Remoting, Distributed Transactions, and Message Queues into a single Service-oriented architecture model for distributed computing, where a server exposes a service via an interface, defined using XML, to which clients connect. WCF runs in a sandbox and provides the enhanced security model all .NET applications provide. WCF is capable of using SOAP for communication between two processes, thereby making WCF based applications interoperable with any other process that communicates via SOAP. When a WCF process communicates with a non-WCF process, XML based encoding is used for the SOAP messages but when it communicates with another WCF process, the SOAP messages are encoded in an optimized binary format, to optimize the communication. Both the encodings conform to the data structure of the SOAP format, called Infoset. Windows Vista also incorporates Microsoft Message Queuing 4.0 (MSMQ) that supports subqueues, poison messages (messages which continually fail to be processed correctly by the receiver), and transactional receives of messages from a remote queue. WF Windows Workflow Foundation is a Microsoft technology for defining, executing and managing workflows. This technology is part of .NET Framework 3.0 and therefore targeted primarily for the Windows Vista operating system. The Windows Workflow Foundation runtime components provide common facilities for running and managing the workflows and can be hosted in any CLR application domain. Workflows comprise 'activities'. Developers can write their own domain-specific activities and then use them in workflows. Windows Workflow Foundation also provides a set of general-purpose 'activities' that cover several control flow constructs. It also includes a visual workflow designer. The workflow designer can be used within Visual Studio 2005, including integration with the Visual Studio project system and debugger. Windows CardSpace Windows CardSpace (codenamed InfoCard), a part of .NET Framework 3.0, is an implementation of Identity Metasystem, which centralizes acquiring, usage and management of digital identity. A digital identity is represented as logical Security Tokens, that each consist of one or more Claims, which provide information about different aspects of the identity, such as name, address etc. Any identity system centers around three entities ‚Äî the User who is to be identified, an Identity Provider who provides identifying information regarding the User, and Relying Party who uses the identity to authenticate the user. An Identity Provider may be a service like Active Directory, or even the user who provides an authentication password, or biometric authentication data. A Relying Party issues a request to an application for an identity, by means of a Policy that states what Claims it needs and what will be the physical representation of the security token. The application then passes on the request to Windows CardSpace, which then contacts a suitable Identity Provider and retrieves the Identity. It then provides the application with the Identity along with information on how to use it. Windows CardSpace also keeps a track of all Identities used, and represents them as visually identifiable virtual cards, accessible to the user from a centralized location. Whenever an application requests any identity, Windows CardSpace informs the user about which identity is being used and needs confirmation before it provides the requestor with the identity. Windows CardSpace presents an API that allows any application to use Windows CardSpace to handle authentication tasks. Similarly, the API allows Identity Providers to hook up with Windows CardSpace. To any Relying Party, it appears as a service which provides authentication credentials. Other .NET Framework APIs * Microsoft UI Automation (UIA) is a managed code API replacing Microsoft Active Accessibility to drive user interfaces. UIA is designed to serve both assistive technology and test-automation requirements. * .NET Framework 3.0 also includes a managed code speech API which has similar functionality to SAPI 5 but is suitable to be used by managed code applications. =Media Foundation= Media Foundation is a set of COM-based APIs to handle audio and video playback that provides DirectX Video Acceleration 2.0 and better resilience to CPU, I/O, and memory stress for glitch-free low-latency playback of audio and video. It also enables high color spaces through the multimedia processing pipeline. DirectShow and Windows Media SDK will be gradually deprecated in future versions. =Search= The Windows Vista Instant Search index can also be accessed programmatically using both managed as well as native code. Native code connects to the index catalog by using a Data Source Object retrieved from Windows Vista shell's Indexing Service OLE DB provider. Managed code use the MSIDXS ADO.NET provider with the index catalog name. A catalog on a remote machine can also be specified using a UNC path. The criteria for the search is specified using a SQL-like syntax. The default catalog is called SystemIndex and it stores all the properties of indexed items with a predefined naming pattern. For example, the name and location of documents in the system is exposed as a table with the column names System. ItemName and System. ItemURL respectively. An SQL query can directly refer these tables and index catalogues and use the MSIDXS provider to run queries against them. The search index can also be used via OLE DB, using the CollatorDSO provider. However, OLE DB provider is read-only, supporting only SELECT and GROUP ON SQL statements. The Windows Search API can also be used to convert a search query written using Advanced Query Syntax (or Natural Query Syntax, the natural language version of AQS) to SQL queries. It exposes a method GenerateSQLFromUserQuery method of the ISearchQueryHelper interface. Searches can also be performed using the search-ms: protocol, which is a pseudo protocol that lets searches be exposed as an URI. It contains all the operators and search terms specified in AQS. It can refer to saved search folders as well. When such a URI is activated, Windows Search, which is registered as a handler for the protocol, parses the URI to extract the parameters and perform the search. =Networking= Winsock Kernel (WSK) is a new transport-independent kernel-mode Network Programming Interface (NPI) for that provides TDI client developers with a sockets-like programming model similar to those supported in user-mode Winsock. While most of the same sockets programming concepts exist as in user-mode Winsock such as socket, creation, bind, connect, accept, send and receive, Winsock Kernel is a completely new programming interface with unique characteristics such as asynchronous I/O that uses IRPs and event callbacks to enhance performance. TDI is supported in Windows Vista for backward compatibility. Windows Vista includes a specialized QoS API called qWave (Quality Windows Audio/Video Experience), which is a pre-configured Quality of Service module for time dependent multimedia data, such as audio or video streams. qWave uses different packet priority schemes for real-time flows (such as multimedia packets) and best-effort flows (such as file downloads or e-mails) to ensure that real time data gets as little delays as possible, while providing a high quality channel for other data packets. Windows Filtering Platform allows external applications to access and hook into the packet processing pipeline of the networking subsystem. =Cryptography= Windows Vista features an update to the Microsoft Crypto API known as Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG). CNG is an extensible, user mode and kernel mode API that includes support for Elliptic curve cryptography and a number of newer algorithms that are part of the National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B. It also integrates with the smart card subsystem by including a Base CSP module which encapsulates the smart card API so that developers do not have to write complex CSPs. Other features and changes * Support for Unicode 5.0 * A number of new fonts: ** Latin fonts: Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas (monotype), Constantia, and Corbel. Segoe UI, previously used in Windows XP Media Center Edition, is also included, despite licensing issues with Linotype. ** Meiryo, supporting the new and modified characters of the JIS X 0213:2004 standard ** Non-Latin fonts: Microsoft JhengHei (Chinese Traditional), Microsoft YaHei (Chinese Simplified), Majalla UI (Arabic), Gisha (Hebrew), Leelawadee (Thai) and Malgun Gothic (Korean). ** Support for Adobe CFF/Type2 fonts, which provides support for contextual and discretionary ligatures. * When accessing files with the ANSI character set, if the total path length is more than the maximum allowed 260 characters, Windows Vista automatically uses the alternate short names (which has an 8.3 limit) to shorten the total path length. In Unicode mode, this is not done as the maximum allowed length is 32,000. * The long \\"Documents and Settings\\" folder is now just \\"Users\\", although a symbolic link called \\"Documents and Settings\\" is kept for compatibility. The paths of several special folders under the user profile have changed. * New support for infrared receivers and Bluetooth 2.0 wireless standards; devices supporting these can transfer files and sync data wirelessly to a Windows Vista computer with no additional software. * A non- administrator user can share only the folders under his user profile. In addition, all users have a Public folder which is shared, though an administrator can override this. * Network ProjectionMicrosoft release regarding Network Projection is used to detect and use network-connected projectors. It can be used to display a presentation, or share a presentation with the machine which hosts the projector. Users can do this over a network so multiple sources can be connected at different times without having to keep moving the sources or projectors around. The network projector can be connected to the network via wireless or cable (LAN) technology to make it even more flexible. Users can not only connect to the network projector remotely but can also remotely configure it. Network projectors are designed to transmit and display still images, such as photographs and slides ‚Äînot high-bandwidth transmissions, such as video streams. The projector can transmit video, but the playback quality is often poor.http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/network-projectors- faq#1TC=windows-7 Binary %windir%\\\\system32\\\\NetProj.exe implement Network Projection feature. * New monitor configuration APIs make it possible to adjust the monitor's display area, save and restore display settings, calibrate color and use vendor-specific monitor features. Overall too, Windows Vista is designed to be more resolution-independent than its predecessors, with a particular focus on higher resolutions and high DPI displays . Windows Presentation Foundation and WPF applications are fully resolution-independent. Also, Transient Multimon Manager, a new feature that uses the monitor's EDID enables automatic detection, setup and proper configuration of additional or multiple displays as they are attached and removed, on the fly. The settings are saved on a per-display basis when possible, so that users can move among multiple displays with no manual configuration. * Windows Vista includes a WSD-WIA class driver that enables all devices compliant with Microsoft's Web Services for Scanner (WS-Scan) protocol to work with WIA without any additional driver or software. * The Fax service and model are fully account- based. Fax-aware applications such as Windows Fax and Scan can send multiple documents in a single fax submission. The Fax Service API generates TIFF files for each document and merges them into a single TIFF file. Users can right- click a document in Windows Explorer and select Send to Fax Recipient. * Windows Vista introduces the 'Assistance Platform' based on MAML. Help and Support is intended to be more meaningful and clear. Guided Help, or Active Content Wizard is an automated tutorial and self-help system available with the release of Windows Vista where a series of animated steps show users how to complete a particular task. It highlights only the options and the parts of screen that are relevant to the task and darkening the rest of the screen. A separate file format is used for ACW help files. The guided help SDK got replaced in Windows 7 with the Windows Troubleshooting Platform. * All standard text editing controls and all versions of the 'RichEdit' control now support the Text Services Framework. Also, all Tablet/Ink API applications and all HTML applications which use Internet Explorer's Trident layout engine support the Text Services Framework.Enabling Text Correction for Custom Ink Collectors * Windows Data Access Components (Windows DAC) replace MDAC 2.81 which shipped with Windows XP Service Pack 2. * DFS Replication, the successor to File Replication Service, is a state-based replication engine for file replication among DFS shares, which supports replication scheduling and bandwidth throttling. It uses Remote Differential Compression to detect and replicate only the change to files, rather than replicating entire files, if changed. DFS-R is also included with Windows Server 2003 R2. * As with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, in Windows Vista x64, old 16-bit Windows programs are not supported. If 16-bit software needs to be run in 64-bit Windows Vista, virtualization can be used for running a 32-bit operating system.

He became the co-inventor in 1897 of modern with professional carom billiards player William A. Spinks.\\"The World's Most Tragic Man Is the One Who Never Starts\\" , Clark, Neil M.; originally published in The American magazine, May 1927; republished in Hotwire: The Newsletter of the Toaster Museum Foundation, vol. 3, no. 3, online edition; accessed February 24, 2007. The piece is largely an interview of Hoskins., March 9, 1897 He is, however, best known for the invention of the electric heating coil ‚Äì the basis for numerous ubiquitous household and industrial appliances, including electric stoves, space heaters, and toasters ‚Äì and the invention of the first electric toaster. Career =Early life= William Hoskins was born in 1862 to parents John and Mary Ann Hoskins, in Chicago. Hoskins would complete just two of three years of Chicago High School; despite having an interest in chemistry, he would gain no formal education in chemistry throughout his early years. Hoskins, however, received \\"private instruction\\" in the field, before joining (at age thirteen), the Illinois State Microscopical Society. Four years later, at 17, the society elected him secretary. After leaving high school in 1880 at age 17, Hoskins prepared chemical analysis samples for Chicago-based consulting and analytical chemist Guy A. Mariner in the latter's commercial laboratory, starting in February. Beginning in 1880, Mariner was one of only three completely commercial chemists in Chicago. Five years after joining the laboratory, Hoskins became Mariner's partner; the firm was renamed Mariner and Hoskins. Shortly before becoming the partner, Hoskins married Mariner's daughter, Ada Mae, on December 18, 1883. In 1890, Hoskins became sole proprietor of the laboratory. The couple subsequently had four children: Minna, Edward, William, and Florence. =Later career= In 1897, Hoskins began working with William A. Spinks before becoming a partner in William A. Spinks & Co. In the early 1900s, Hoskins would also become the director of Hoskins Manufacturing Co., based in Detroit, creating electric heating appliances and pyrometers. He was made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and was also a charter member of the Chicago section of the American Chemical Society (ACS), of which he was the chairman in 1897, later becoming the national ACS's vice-president,. Hoskins Manufacturing eventually become Hoskins Process Development Co., of which he was the president. Hoskins became a recognized scientific expert witness in lawsuits, took out 37 US patents, and in Hoskins's lab, Albert L. Marsh developed nichrome under supervision of Hoskins. Hoskins's own innovations include a superior billiard chalk, materials used to construct race tracks (including the Washington Park Race Tracks in Chicago), safety paper for bank checks, a method for destroying weeds, and a gasoline blowtorch. Inventions =Electric heating coil= William Hoskins is credited with invention of the electric heating coil. In the early 1900s, having worked on a form of nichrome known as chromel, working with Marsh over the alloy, he deduced that it could be used as a heating element. The heating coil was created using nichrome, and was later used in early versions of the toaster, and the electric kettle. The heating coil was one of the first projects for Hoskins Manufacturing Co.; Hoskins had considered manufacturing toasters, but later abandoned those plans, and focused on the coil itself. =Billiard chalk= Box top of a box of a dozen cubes of William A. Spinks Company billiard chalk, ca. 1900‚Äì1910. Note the endorsement by champion Jacob Schaefer Sr. In the late 19th century, actual chalk (generally calcium carbonate, also known as calcite or carbonate of lime) was often used in cue sports on the leather tips of cue sticks to better grip the cue ball, but players experimented with other powdery, abrasive substances, since chalk itself was abrasive, and over time damaged the game equipment.Tobey, Eddie (November 9, 2006). \\"Billiards Chalk\\", EZineArticles.com; retrieved February 24, 2007.

In 1892, the aforementioned straight rail billiards pro William Spinks was particularly impressed by a piece of natural chalk-like substance obtained in France, and presented it to Hoskins for analysis. Hoskins, having encountered such material before, was able to determine that it was volcanic ash (pumice), probably from Mount Etna, Sicily. The two of them experimented with different formulations to achieve the cue ball \\"\\" that Spinks sought.

The William A.

(\\"To whom can I tell my sins?\\") was the Hungarian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1994, performed in Hungarian by Friderika. This was Hungary's d√©but entry in the contest, and consequently the first time that Hungarian had been used on the contest stage. With music and lyrics by Szilveszter Jenei, who also provided live backing on an acoustic guitar, the song is a ballad, with Friderika wondering who she can confess her sins to. The sins in question are never mentioned explicitly, however the imagery of the song (\\"the lightless night\\", \\"no faith, no love\\") suggests that they are serious. One possible interpretation is that the song is about a woman who became pregnant and was subsequently left by her lover. (\\"There's no faith, no love, no caressing hand for me.\\" \\"I'm crying without tears to my unborn child.\\") The song was performed twenty-second on the night, following Spain's Alejandro Abad with \\"Ella no es ella\\" and preceding Russia's Youddiph with \\"Vyechniy stranik\\". At the close of voting, it had received 122 points, placing 4th in a field of 25. In the initial voting, in fact, the song received three consecutive 12-point scores (the highest possible) to lead the field and earn Hungary the distinction of being the only d√©buting entrant to date to lead the voting at the start, before fading to place fourth. This result, coupled with Poland's Edyta G√≥rniak placing second with \\"To Nie Ja\\", presaged the dominance of Central and Eastern European entries in future years - a dominance in which Poland and Hungary were to play a very little role. It was succeeded as Hungarian representative at the 1995 contest by Csaba Szigeti with \\"√öj n√©v a r√©gi h√°z fal√°n\\". An English-language version was later recorded, titled \\"Who Will Be There\\" and featuring similarly bleak lyrics. Friderika sings at one point that \\"I will never know the beauty of my child\\".

Edmond Tulasne (12 September 1815 ‚Äì 22 December 1885) was a French botanist and mycologist born in Azay-le-Rideau. He originally studied law at Poitiers, but his interest later turned to botany. As a young man he assisted botanist Auguste de Saint-Hilaire (1779‚Äì1853) with studies of Brazilian flora. From 1842 until 1872 he worked as a naturalist at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. In 1854 he succeeded Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (1797-1853) as a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences. He died in Hy√®res on 22 December 1885, age 70. Tulasne's specialized study was the science of mycology. His microscopic investigation of fungi, particularly parasitic species, contributed much to the understanding on the complexities of their nature and development. He is credited with introducing the concept of \\"pleomorphy\\" in regard to fungi.Biography and Photo; Louis Ren√© Tulasne Mushroom the Journal Pleomorphy states that an individual fungus, growing in different substrates can have dramatically different forms. In 1853 he introduced his views on the reproduction cycle of Claviceps purpurea (ergot).Quarterly journal of microscopical science, Volume 5 by Daniel and Eleanor Albert Collection A number of mycological species, as well as the genera Tulasneinia and Tulasnella (family Tulasnellaceae) are named after him. He is credited with providing classification taxa for the following genera: Crucibulum, Glomus, Sebacina, Terfezia, Tilletia and Hypomyces (the latter genus with Elias Magnus Fries). He also produced some important works on flowering plants. For example, in 1855, he published two papers on the magnoliid family Monimiaceae,Lisa DeCesare. 2006. \\"Tulasne Brothers Exhibit\\" Newsletter of the friends of the Farlow 47(spring 2006):6-7.

Some of his best work was done in collaboration with his brother, Charles Tulasne (1816‚Äì1884), such as \\"Fungi hypogaei\\" (1851) and the three-volume \\"Selecta fungorum carpologia\\" (1861‚Äì65).

The quarterfinal games were televised nationwide on ESPN2. Semifinals and the championship game were televised on ESPN. The tournament was also televised by Raycom Sports in ACC markets. For the first time ever, Raycom broadcast the tournament in high definition. The top four regular season teams (North Carolina, Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Boston College) received first-round byes and played their first games in the quarterfinals. Both North Carolina and Virginia finished the regular season tied for first place with an 11‚Äì5 record, but North Carolina received the #1 seed by virtue of the head-to-head tiebreaker. All four opening-round games were won by the lower seeds. This tournament was the lowest Duke had been seeded (seventh) in the ACC Tournament since 1995, when they were the ninth seed. Their on-court struggles were compounded by the suspension of freshman Gerald Henderson.Henderson suspended for late foul By defeating Duke, NC State ended Duke's 8-year domination of the ACC Tournament. Prior to this loss, Duke was 23‚Äì1 in ACC Tournament play over the previous 8 years, losing only the 2004 finals to Maryland. The 2007 final round was identical to the final round of the Women's ACC Tournament, with North Carolina beating NC State for the title. The 2007 tournament marked the first time a 10th seed won a game in an ACC tournament, much less three in a row (although 12th seed Wake Forest won two games in the 2006 Tournament). It was the second time a team has played 4 games (NC State in 1997), and the first time a team seeded as low as 10 reached the championship game. Previously the lowest seed to reach the title game was #8 seed NC State in 1997, when the conference had nine members. By winning the ACC championship, North Carolina received an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. North Carolina's Brandan Wright won the tournament's Most Valuable Player award.

It is based on the romantic political view that gives more weight to the organic and whole nature of peasant culture.  Origin  Marcus Porcius Cato or Cato Major. Barrington Moore introduced Catonism in his book Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy as the \\"advocacy of the sterner virtues, militarism, contempt for 'decadent' foreigners and anti- intellectualism\\". Moore coined the word \\"Catonism\\" with a nod towards Cato the Elder (234-149 BCE). He characterized the Catonist attitude as the reaction from rural aristocracy towards rapid political and economic changes. Beliefs The social order has three core beliefs. The first is the notion that liberty is the highest good and that sacrifices made for its achievement is a worthy pursuit. The second is the belief that service to one's country constitutes an individual's most important calling. Finally, it holds that the proper outlook towards power must be anchored on vigilance since authority can be utilized to achieve a specific purpose or advance an interest. Moreover, policies are not supported to obtain happiness or wealth but to contribute to a way of life that proved valid in the past.

It serves Syracuse and its suburbs, with studios and offices located on Smokey Hollow Road in Baldwinsville. Since September 2017 the station has simulcast Craig Fox's \\"Dinosaur Radio\\" classic hits format; programming originates on WSEN. History The earliest Syracuse broadcasting stations, all of which were short-lived, were: WBAB (Andrew J. Potter, April 19, 1922‚ÄîMarch 22, 1923); WDAI (Hughes Electrical Corporation, May 16, 1922‚ÄîNovember 19, 1923); WFAB (Carl Frank Woese, June 6, 1922‚ÄîOctober 9, 1924)\\"United States Pioneer Broadcast Service Stations\\" (earlyradiohistory.us) and WLAH, first licensed in the summer of 1922 to Samuel Woodworth,\\"New Stations: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1922, page 3. and deleted in the fall of 1924.\\"Alterations and Corrections: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 1, 1924, page 10. A contemporary write-up of WFBL's debut referred to both WFAB and WLAH as low-powered \\"private stations\\", which \\"have now been dismantled\\", and contrasted them to WFBL, which it called \\"Syracuse's first professional station\\".\\"Syracuse Will Dine to Onondaga Orchestra Tunes as Radio Dealers Open Powerful Broadcast Station\\" by Howard H. Smith, Syracuse Herald, November 19, 1924, page 15. WFBL's first license was issued to the Onondaga Hotel, and dated November 20, 1924.\\"New Stations: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 1, 1924, page 3. The call letters were sequentially assigned,Other stations first licensed the same month as WFBL included WFBK, Hanover, New Hampshire; WFBM, Indianapolis, Indiana; WFBQ, Raleigh, North Carolina; and WFBR, Baltimore, Maryland. and the station initially adopted the slogan \\"When Feeling Blue, Listen\\", based on the call sign. WFBL was described as the culmination of \\"many months\\" of cooperative effort between the Radio Dealers Association and the hotel. Studios were located on the 11th floor of the Onondaga, with an antenna constructed on the roof. Samuel Woodworth was credited with having \\"shouldered the burden of mechanical installation and testing\\", and was WFBL's General Manager at the time of his death in 1954.\\"Samuel Woodworth\\" (obituary), The Billboard, November 6, 1954, page 53. Some of WLAH's equipment was transferred to be used by WFBL;\\"WFBL Was Born of Necessity: To Sell More Radios!\\" by Joe Ganley, January 25, 1987. (Reprinted in More Than Just a Sound by Steve Auyer, September 2001, pages 54-55) consequently, station staff began to link WLAH's and WFBL's histories, resulting with the station's slogan later becoming the \\"First Broadcasting License\\" in central New York. However, government regulators have consistently considered WLAH and WFBL to be separate stations, and Federal Communications Commission records list November 20, 1924 as WFBL's first license date.\\"First License\\" entry AM Query Results: WFBL (FCC.gov) WFBL was a charter member of the CBS Radio Network, being one of the 16 stations that aired the first CBS network program on September 18, 1927.\\"Columbia Broadcasting System: Radio Stations\\" (advertisement), Radio Digest, September 1927, page 20. The other stations were WOR (Newark); WADC (Akron); WAIU (Columbus); WCAO (Baltimore); WCAU (Philadelphia); WEAN (Providence); WGHP (Detroit); WJAS (Pittsburgh); WKRC (Cincinnati);WMAK (Buffalo-Lockport); WMAQ (Chicago); WNAC (Boston); WOWO (Fort Wayne); KMOX (Saint Louis); and KOIL (Council Bluffs). In late 1932, controlling interest in the station was bought by Oscar and Robert Soule and Samuel H. Cook. From May 1979 to October 1980, WFBL, then known as \\"Fire 14,\\" used consultant Mike Joseph's Hot Hits format as a Top 40 competitor to 1490 WOLF. The station dropped \\"Hot Hits\\" in October 1980 in favor of the then-emerging adult standards format called Music of Your Life. The WFBL calls (and standards format) later moved to 1050 AM in Baldwinsville, New York (now WBVG) before returning to their original home at 1390. WFBL changed its call letters to WLLF on October 17, 1989, but returned to WFBL two weeks later. On September 21, 1993, it became WDCW, but returned once again to WFBL on December 1, 2003. leftFor a few years, when it was owned by Buckley Broadcasting, WFBL featured a line-up that closely mirrored its sister talk station, 710 WOR in New York City. This continued until April 7, 2008 at 6:00AM, when WFBL switched formats from \\"Talk Radio 1390\\" to \\"Oldies 1390\\", featuring music from the 1950s and 1960s.\\"WSEN, WFBL to Flip Formats\\", April 1, 2008 (CNYRadio.com)\\"NorthEast Radio Watch: New York\\" by Scott Fybush, April 7, 2008 (fybush.com) However, on October 12, 2009, the Oldies format moved to WSEN 1050 and WFBL returned to the talk radio format. In late 2015, Leatherstocking Media Group reached an agreement to sell some of its assets to the Family Life Network, a regional Christian music network. The sale did not include WFBL but it did give the network rights to share WFBL's transmitter and gave Family Life right of first refusal to purchase WFBL and match any bid for the station; although because Family Life owned no AM stations and promptly traded away the other Syracuse station included in the deal to Craig Fox, such a sale was deemed unlikely. On September 3, 2016 WFBL went silent due to insufficient funds to correct equipment problems. The station resumed broadcasting on August 7, 2017, with a 1950s and 1960s Oldies format. Craig Fox reached an agreement to purchase the station's license for Wolf Radio, Inc. from Leatherstocking for $275,000. While there were questions whether Fox, who was at the maximum number of allowable license holdings in the Syracuse market and had run into complications with the Family Life trades, would be allowed to consummate the sale,\\"Station Sales Week of 4/28\\" by Lance Venta, April 28, 2017 (radioinsight.com) it was eventually consummated on August 22, 2017.

It is a brood parasite upon mouthbrooding cichlids. This species grows to a length of TL. This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries. General Synodontis multipunctatus Synodontis multipunctatus is one of a number of species of upside-down catfish in Lake Tanganyika, which is more famous for its cichlids. It gathers in large schools at depths of about in the lake. S. multipunctatus is notable for its breeding behaviour - it is a brood parasite, similar to the cuckoo from which it takes its common name. Lake Tanganyika is home to a number of mouthbrooding cichlids, which care for their eggs and young by carrying them in their mouth. S. multipunctatus uses these, particularly Ctenochromis horei and Simochromis babaulti, as unwitting caretakers for their children. The smell of spawning cichlids excites S. multipunctatus into spawning, and as the cichlids lay their eggs the catfish will quickly slip in and eat its eggs before they can be collected by the mother. While doing so they also release and fertilise their own eggs. The female cichlid will hastily attempt to scoop up her eggs and, in doing so, will also collect eggs from S. multipunctatus. These eggs will then hatch inside the unwilling adoptive mother's mouth, and proceed to eat the cichlid eggs present before being released by the cichlid. This technique removes the burden of parental care from the S. multipunctatus, and allows them to breed again sooner. In the aquarium Synodontis multipunctatus are a popular addition to cichlid aquariums. They grow to about 15 cm, and can be bred in captivity provided suitable hosts are present(?). Some aquarists have had success with host cichlids from Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria as well as those from Lake Tanganyika. They can be very aggressive and territorial towards other synodontis species, they should be kept in groups over 3 to avoid competition between two, and proper cover and cave like structures should be provided. They seem to be active in the day as much as the night and can prove quite lively. If kept in larger groups territorial issues are less likely.

He was the chairman of Gruma, the largest producer of tortillas and corn flour in the world, and of Banorte, the largest Mexican-owned private bank in Mexico. Because of his prominent role in the expansion of Gruma, he was often nicknamed \\"El Maseco\\" or \\"Don Maseco\\" (a reference to one of Gruma's subsidiaries, Grupo Industrial Maseca), as well as the \\"King of Tortillas\\". Personal life Barrera was born in Cerralvo, Nuevo Le√≥n. At the age of five, before starting school, he was selling eggs, bread, vegetables and other foodstuff in his native town of Cerralvo. \\"I was very happy,\\" wrote Gonzalez Barrera in an institutional profile. \\"My childhood was very happy but I did not miss school. When I had free time I went to the streets to make money.\\" Upon entering primary school he also became a shoe-shine, along with his sale of food on the street. Almost naturally, at age 11 he left school for good and began working in a grocery warehouse his father had opened in Cerralvo where he sold dairy products, and at age 15, he had his own business. \\"I remember one day my grandfather asked me which of all the things I did, was the most profitable. I replied that selling vegetables,\\" wrote Gonzalez Barrera in his institutional profile. \\"Then he said, 'Give yourself completely to it and do nothing more.\\" \\"It seemed like a call to action.\\" Later Gonzalez Barrera worked in Pemex, as a driver at a plant in Veracruz, where he was in charge of something no one wanted to do, because of the risk: explosive transport. It was during this time that he also partnered in a small coconut plantation. He made good money, but after two years, suffering from malaria, he returned to his hometown, with 200,000.00 pesos of his earnings in the coconut business. In Cerralvo, entered into joint partnership with his father in the family business that had already begun and developed new projects. At age 18, in the search for further business expansion, he had his first encounter with corn, on seeing his first corn mill. Curious, he asked for explanations about the process for the manufacture of tortillas, and realizing the business potential when he discovered that cotton workers consumed up to 15 tons of corn per month, imagined the future. After convincing his father, they bought their first corn mill in 1948 for 75,000.00 pesos (the peso-dollar exchange rate fluctuated between $4.85 and $6.95), and took it to Cerralvo, where he started what is now Maseca, the company that manufactures and markets one out of every four corn tortillas in Europe, Asia and Central America. For starting it off they had to sell all of their other businesses, and when they ran out of money, a friend he had made in Cerralvo, General Bonifacio Salinas Leal, governor of Nuevo Le√≥n, lent them money and kept some of the company's stock that, years later, would sell back to them again. Thus began a long relationship with politicians, which is one of the most repeated criticism that is made to Gonzalez Barrera: leveraging his political connections for his company's growth. He entered the Billionaire's club not with the tortilla business, however, but through the Banorte financial group of which, since 1992 he has been the main shareholder, and the only Mexican bank to remains in Mexican ownership after the economic crisis of 1995. Its equity stake in Banorte, the third largest bank in Mexico, returned Gonzalez Barrera to 2011's Forbes list of billionaires, and that fact changed the nature of his wealth. Some health and family problems threaten Maseca (where 23% of the stock is owned by U.S. conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland). and most of the remainder is split in half, with 50% held by his first wife, from whom he never divorced. Gonz√°lez Barrera died in Houston, Texas, on 25 August 2012 from complications of cancer, he was 81 years old. His son Roberto Gonz√°lez Sr. was a racecar driver, finishing third at the 1976 12 Hours of Sebring. His grandsons Ricardo Gonz√°lez Valdez and Roberto Gonz√°lez Valdez are also racecar drivers.

Kilwinning Abbey was a Tironensian house in Cunninghame, in existence since the 1160s. He appears for the first time in this capacity as witness to a charter of Walter Comyn of Rowallan. In 1344, Deyn, perhaps through Stewart patronage, was chosen to succeed Alexander de Kininmund as Bishop of Aberdeen. Deyn travelled to continental Europe, and by 27 September had received consecration. His consecration had been performed by Cardinal Peter Despres. In May 1345, the Pope appointed him as Scotland's papal tax collector, a duty Deyn fulfilled, sending the proceeds to the papacy via merchants in Bruges. He was one of the notables who petitioned the papacy in 1347 to legitimise the marriage of Robert Stewart and Elizabeth More of Rowallan. In 1349 he was in attendance with the Justiciar of Scotia holding court at the standing stones of Old Rayne in Garioch. He died on 20 August 1350 and was buried in the choir of Aberdeen Cathedral.

Roma is portrayed on the obverse, while the reverse depicts two gladiators. It may represent a political promise from Didius to offer gladiatorial shows, should he be elected curule aedile.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, p. 308. The gens Didia, or Deidia, as the name is spelled on coins, was a plebeian family at Ancient Rome, which first appears in history during the final century of the Republic. According to Cicero, they were novi homines. Titus Didius obtained the consulship in 98 BC, a dignity shared by no other Didii until imperial times.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 1004 (\\"Didia Gens\\").Cicero, Pro Murena, 8. Origin The nomen Didius or Deidius is of uncertain origin. It resembles a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in -idus, but might be derived from a cognomen Dida. Chase classifies it among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, pp. 121, 122, 130. However, Olli Salomies has documented several examples of Diidiis used as a family name amongst the Oscans.Salomies, \\"The Nomina of the Samnites. A Checklist\\", p. 151. Praenomina The earlier Didii used the praenomina Sextus, Titus, and Gaius, to which later members of the family added Quintus, Aulus, and Lucius. All of these were common throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina None of the Didii mentioned during the Republic is known to have borne a cognomen. A number of surnames are found under the Empire, of which the only one that appears to be a family name is Gallus. This cognomen, referring to a cockerel, belongs to an abundant class of cognomina derived from the names of everyday objects and animals. The same surname could also refer to a Gaul, indicating someone of Gaulish descent, or whose appearance or character resembled that of a Gaul.Chase, pp. 112‚Äì114.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. gallus.

The film was partially written by Dorothy Parker, based on a novel by Herman Gorman. The Academy Award-nominated theme for Suzy, \\"Did I Remember?\\", was sung by Virginia Verrill (uncredited). Plot In 1914, American showgirl Suzanne Trent (Jean Harlow) is in London, hoping to meet and marry a man with money. She tells her friend Maisie (Inez Courtney) she can charm any man she chooses into marrying her, and then learn to love him. She sets her sights on Terry Moore (Franchot Tone), an Irishman she sees in a borrowed Rolls-Royce. She soon learns he is not wealthy, but he has a respectable job and good prospects, being an engineer, inventor, and pilot. They quickly fall in love and marry. But then they stumble on a German plot, and her husband is shot by a mysterious woman (Benita Hume), who leaves immediately. The landlady arrives moments later and hysterically calls for police, accusing Suzy of murder. Suzy also flees the scene, and therefore does not learn that Terry is expected to survive. Maisie has moved to Paris, and Suzy now follows her, taking a job at the same cabaret just before World War I begins. Thinking she is a widow, Suzy is heartbroken, until she meets the famed French flying ace Andre Charville (Cary Grant) at the cabaret. Again they quickly fall in love and get married. Andre's aristocratic father, Baron Edward Charville (Lewis Stone), welcomes Suzy into the family home, but is concerned about the whirlwind romance and marriage because Andre has had many short-lived relationships with women. After Andre is recalled to the front, Suzy bonds with the old man, even inventing letters from Andre that she pretends to read to him. The Baron's concern was justified: when Andre returns briefly to Paris, he is more interested in socializing with his fellow pilots‚Äîand their girlfriends‚Äîthan taking the opportunity to see the wife he has not even told them about. The Baron covers for him, but makes sure Andre and Suzy do meet for a few minutes as he returns to the front. Andre is wounded in action, and Suzy goes to comfort him. There she is shocked to meet Terry, who is delivering to Andre's squadron new British fighters he helped design. She explains to Terry what happened, but tells him she now loves Andre. Terry is incensed at her for not telling Andre she was already married to him, and for having run away. He assumes she never loved him. Suzy goes to Andre to tell him the truth‚Äîand has another shock, finding him in a compromising position with the woman who shot Terry. Unable to think clearly, she returns home to Paris, where she finds a magazine photo of Andre with the woman. Her name is Diane Eyrelle and she has been \\"caring for\\" Andre during his recovery. Obviously she is actually spying on him. Suzy returns to the air base and tells Terry what she has learned. He is dubious but agrees to take action. Suzy points out that as Andre is a public figure, for the sake of morale they should try to avoid damaging his reputation. So they first confront Andre, but Diane hears them, and as the four argue, her henchman comes in and shoots Andre. Andre was about to return to active service and is scheduled to take off immediately on a dangerous mission. Terry says he can fetch a doctor or take over the flight, but has no time to do both. Andre says to fly the mission. Terry takes his revenge, killing Diane and her henchman by strafing their car, then shooting down the German fighters meant to ambush Andre. He botches the landing and crashes near the chateau where Andre now lies dead. Suzy and Terry move his body so it will seem he died in the crash. At the funeral that follows, even a German flyer pays homage. The movie ends with Terry being ordered to see the ace's widow back home to Paris.

Wilmot's writing on football and sport in general were authoritative and displayed wisdom and generosity. Along with Hugh Buggy, Wilmot was believed to have coined the term \\"bodyline\\" during the 1932/33 Ashes Test cricket series. Wilmot also wrote several books on cricket including Defending The Ashes 1932-33 which gave a rare Australian perspective on this historic and controversial series. https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2444318 Early life He was born in Bairnsdale, in Gippsland, the son of surveyor John George Winchester Wilmot and Hannah Louise Whittakers. His father, an English coffee planter in Sri Lanka, migrated to Australia in 1852. His mother, the daughter of a squatter in Tubbut, Gippsland, also had English ancestry. Through his mother, he was the first cousin of children's author Mary Grant Bruce. Wilmot was a student at Melbourne Grammar School and from 1889 at Trinity College (University of Melbourne), where he studied law.Trinity College, Calendar, 1897. A ringleader of the Trinity College Secession, he left before graduation. Career He would later be heavily involved in organising amateur sport in Melbourne and often used his newspaper columns to promote the value of school sport, particularly as it was played in public schools. He supported amateurism in school sport strongly because, as he commented in an article on professional coaches in 1914, \\"the professional very often misses the spirit of sport in his desire to gain\\".http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1998/st1501/st1501f.pdf Wilmot strongly held loathing of professional sport carried over to his love of football. In 1915, then the vice-president of the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association, he used his position as The Argus football scribe, \\"Old Boy\\", to launch an attack on the mercenary nature of professional football, arguing that professional football did not improve the calibre of man and did nothing to improve the sport and, as such, was of no value to the community.http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j28/j28-blai.htm In 1932, he sailed to Sri Lanka, where he reported on the unofficial test between the England cricket team and All Ceylon All Ceylon cricket team, thereafter accompanying the England team to Australia, reporting on the \\"Bodyline\\" tour. He subsequently wrote Defending the ashes. In July 1935 the Victorian Football League presented Wilmot with a mahogany log box for 46 years service to football as a journalist. In 1939, a long article on his reminiscences was published in The Argus,Norman McCance, \\"A Jubilee of Journalism\\", The Argus, 18 Mar. 1939, p. 4. and he died in Melbourne in May 1949 after an illness of several months. Wilmot was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, with his citation reading: :Writing for The Argus in 1935, he was given an award by the AFL for 46 years of journalism. His work was characterised by authority, wisdom and generosity. In 1998 Wilmot was inducted to the Melbourne Cricket Ground's \\"Rogues Gallery\\", with his citation reading: :Wrote as \\"Old Boy\\" for The Argus and the Australasian from 1902 until the mid-1930s. Correspondent for The Times and Observer and The Times of Ceylon. Author of Defending The Ashes in 1932/33. In addition to his journalism, Wilmot was employed from 1909 to 1949 as secretary of the Melbourne Athenaeum. He published a history of the Athenaeum in 1939. Personal life On 23 November 1897, he married Jane Marion Augusta Tracy. Wilmot's son, Reginald William Winchester \\"Chester\\" Wilmot (1911‚Äì1954), was a famed World War II correspondent and historian.http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160666b.htm?hilite=wilmot His daughter, Jean Winchester Wilmot, married George Fisher Bemis, of Massachusetts, and emigrated to the USA, whence she sent back to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, weekly \\"Letters from America\\", reporting on social, political and wartime life there. http://www.womenaustralia.info/archives/AWH002136.htm  References  Australian Football Hall of Fame * Australian Dictionary of Biography * Amateur Athletic Foundation Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Journalists from Melbourne People educated at Trinity College (University of Melbourne) 1869 births 1949 deaths ","title":"Reginald Wilmot"},{"id":"9706849","text":"Siruvani Waterfalls and the dam named after them are located west of Coimbatore in the Western Ghats. The reservoir at Siruvani was built for Tamil Nadu by the Kerala government with funds collected by the Tamil Nadu government to meet the drinking water requirements of Coimbatore. The gateways on either side of the road across the dam are typical of the Kerala and Tamil architectural styles. Siruvani is also home to certain tribals like the Mudugars and Irulars. The view from the falls and the dam is a tourist attraction. The sweetness has been attributed to the vegetation and rocks through which the water flows in the Attapady area. History The government gave its approval for construction of the \`masonry gravity' dam in February 1915; work did not start immediately; if one correlates the information from the Archaeology Department, Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board and the district gazette. The villagers of Boluvampatti and Alandurai opposed the scheme, as they feared it would affect them. But they were convinced about the benefits of bringing Siruvani water to a town that was growing. Construction began in 1927. Siruvani site was in an extremely unfriendly terrain and wild animals frequented the place. So, all those engaged in construction work stayed in the guest house near Iruttu pallam. They rode to the dam site on horses with gunmen providing security. Even now, a visit to the Siruvani dam is not much different (except that one doesn't have to travel on a horse). Forest guards continue to accompany those who visit the dam. The initial cost of construction was Rs. 2,17,725 (for 23 feet). The reason for selecting the site was that it had perennial streams. The area below the Siruvani, Muthikulam falls, Gobiyaru, Solaiyaru, Pattiyaru, Veeraru and Paambaru falls, the main sources of supply, was identified for construction. There were plans to commission a hydroelectric project at Siruvani, but the move was dropped as the Pykara project in the Nilgiris was mooted at the time. Major and minor construction works continued till 1984 and the total cost was Rs. 26.12 crores. The drawal from the dam was in 1931 was 113 lakh litres for a population of more than 95,000. In the 1970s, the drawal was scaled down to 130 lakh litres from 186 lakh litres in the summer as inflow into the Muthikulam reduced by half. Visitor information It is situated at Siruvani Hills at 37 km from Coimbatore and from Karunya University. Sadivayal Checkpost, where an entry fee Rs. 50 is charged, is at the gateway to the waterfalls. Private vehicles are not allowed beyond this point; however vehicles arranged by the forest department can be used for the conveyance to the point where trek is to be started. No extra charges for this service. An almost 1 km trek-walk through forest is required to reach exact place for bathing. Bus lines 59C, 59, 14E, and the Sirvani and Sadivayal buses, ply at regular intervals from Coimbatore (Gandhipuram Town bus stand). Other projects and places nearby are Parambikulam, Aliyar, Sholiyar, Palar rivers and the Anaimalai Hills range.

He has been involved in the preservation and understanding of the fading musical and musical craft traditions of his native Puerto Rico. Cumpiano was instrumental in the development of the first feature-length documentary about the cuatro and its music, Our Cuatro: The Puerto Ricans and Stringed Instruments, Volumes 1 and 2. Early years Cumpiano was born into a middle-class family in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His father was a native of the town of Rinc√≥n, Puerto Rico, and his mother from Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised in the capital of Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education. On one occasion, Cumpiano wandered into an eatery next to his grade school which had a jukebox. He listened to Odilio Gonz√°lez sing a d√©cima with a guitar and a cuatro in the background. In Puerto Rico the type of music that Odilio Gonz√°lez sang is known as \\"m√∫sica j√≠bara\\", which is Puerto Rico's cultural equivalent of what in the United States is called country music. This early experience would eventually grow into his passion for Puerto Rican traditional instruments and singing. Cumpiano attended the University of Puerto Rico High School in R√≠o Piedras from 1959 to 1961 and St. John's Preparatory School in Santurce from 1961 until his graduation in 1962. He wanted to study engineering, and in 1962 he moved to Medford, Massachusetts. There he enrolled at Tufts University where he discovered that he was more interested in studying art. In 1964, he moved to New York City and studied industrial design at Pratt Institute. He earned his B.Ind.D. (Bachelor of Industrial Design) in 1968, and went to work as a professional furniture designer. Master guitarmaker Cumpiano met master guitarmaker Michael Gurian in 1969, and under Gurian's mentoring he began his training in the craft of guitarmaking. Cumpiano left his job and went to work in Gurian's guitarmaking shop in New Hampshire. In Gurian's guitarmaking shop he met and befriended Gurian's shop foreman, Michael Millard. Eventually Cumpiano and Millard established a shop together named \\"Froggy Bottom Guitars\\", where Cumpiano completed his training in guitarmaking. In 1974, Cumpiano left to establish his first private guitarmaking studio in Williamstown, Massachusetts. During the next twenty-five years he would move his workshop to North Adams, Leeds and then to Amherst, Massachusetts. In 1997, Cumpiano moved his studio to Easthampton Road in Northampton where it currently resides. A \\"Thinline\\" Cumpiano Cuatro Cumpiano's career spans almost forty years of hand- crafting all sorts of fretted stringed instruments from the North American, European and Latin American traditions. In 1985, his interests turned to the stringed instrument traditions of his native Puerto Rico and over the years Cumpiano became an authority on the craft and traditions that surround the \\"national instrument\\" of Puerto Rico, the ten string cuatro. He has built numerous cuatros for musicians in the United States and also has crafted cuatro variants of his own design: he developed a \\"seis\\", or six course (twelve string) cuatro that can be tuned in the same string intervals as a guitar. He also developed the \\"thinline\\" cuatro with a body depth of only two inches instead of the traditional three. Among his customers are Arlo Guthrie, Michael Lorimer, John Abercrombie, Country Joe MacDonald, the Todd Rundgren band, June Millington, and Joel Zoss. Cumpiano has taught his craft for over twenty years out of his studio, in schools, during workshops and lectures and through numerous publications. He has taught cuatro making to young Puerto Rican artisans under grants originating from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) through various regional arts organizations. The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project Cumpiano met Juan Sotomayor, a prize-winning photographer who worked on the New York Times staff. They discovered that there was no serious effort being expended at the University of Puerto Rico to study or research the origins and history, the corpus, of the j√≠baro musical and musical craft traditions. They decided to set out to discover the story of Puerto Rico's traditional stringed instruments and later the story of Puerto Rico's traditional music. In 1992, he co-founded \\"The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project\\" with Juan Sotomayor and Wilfredo Echevarr√≠a, an expert in media communications. The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the traditions that surround the national instrument of Puerto Rico, by means of gathering, promoting and preserving its cultural memories of Puerto Rican musical traditions, folkloric stringed instruments and musicians. The Cuatro Project is also dedicated to promoting and preserving the Puerto Rican d√©cima verse form and the traditional song as created by its greatest troubadours, living and past. Cumpiano, who is also a founding board member and president of the Association of Stringed Instrument Artisans (ASIA), has lectured about his skills at conventions of the Guild of American Luthiers (GAL). He has received the recognition of various institutes, among them the American Institute of Architects and the Smithsonian Institution. He is also the co-recipient of a 1993 U.S. Patent for the compression-molded carbon fibre composite guitar soundboard. Written work and Documentaries GUITARMAKING Cumpiano co-authored, with Jonathon Natelson, the world's leading guitarmaking textbook,Guitarmaking \\"GUITARMAKING: Tradition and Technology\\", a complete reference for the design and construction of the steel string folk guitar and the classical guitar, which has been acclaimed as the principal textbook in his field and considered by many as the Bible of guitarmaking. In 1998, Cumpiano and his colleagues wrote, directed and produced \\"Un Canto en Otra Monta√±a: M√∫sica Puertorrique√±a en Hawaii\\" (A Song [Heard] on Another Mountain: Puerto Rican Music in Hawaii), a short-feature video documentary on the music and social history of the century-old Puerto Rican Diaspora in Hawaii. Cumpiano, together with Sotomayor and Echevarr√≠a, wrote, directed and produced twoDVD documentaries for The Cuatro Project. They are:OUR CUATRO Vol.1, the first feature-length documentary about the cuatro and its music and OUR CUATRO Vol. 2: A Historic Concert. Cumpiano and cultural researcher David Morales produced another DVD documentary THE D√âCIMA BORINQUE√ëA: An Ancient Poetic Singing Tradition, directed by Myriam Fuentes. The proceeds of these recordings were to be used for the research and documentation activities of the Puerto Rican Cuatro Project. OUR CUATRO Vol. 2 *\\"Nuestro Cuatro: Volumen 1, The Puerto Ricans and their stringed instruments\\". An unprecedented documentary that reveals the emotional story of the development and the history of the music and stringed instruments traditions of Puerto Rico. *\\"Nuestro Cuatro: Volumen 2\\", Un Concierto Hist√≥rico/A Historical Concert. This is the conclusion of the video documentary \\"Nuestro Cuatro, a cultural and musical history of the Puerto Rican cuatro and Puerto Rico's stringed instruments\\". *\\"La D√©cima Borinque√±a/The D√©cima Borinque√±a\\" An Ancient Poetic Song Tradition. The tradition of the d√©cima of the Puerto Rican j√≠baros and its singing troubadours can be traced back to popular poetic forms of the Island's colonial past. In them, one can trace the medieval Spanish and Moorish roots of the trovador. Cumpiano also co-produced and co-directed in 2001, the documentary \\"Construyendo Cuatros\\" (\\"Making Cuatros\\"), which comprises visits with two of Puerto Rico's most respected cuatro makers, showing them at work, the sequence of constructing a cuatro, and their impressions of their craft and the future prospects for the instrument.

It is a type of advertising in which companies write and distribute short articles to a range of outlets such as article banks, forums, and newsletter publishers. Its main purpose is to gain a huge number of online audiences and boost the number of sales opportunities for products or services on websites. Another main purpose of this kind of marketing is to build backlinks. This type of marketing strategy can help marketers acquire new visitors and increase sales on their websites. Article marketing is also one of the least costly ways to market a company.  Advantages and disadvantages of article marketing  There are many advantages of using article marketing such as: * Increasing brand awareness - a company can use this marketing strategy to establish a good relationship with their readers, which they can convert into consumers if the company‚Äôs articles are useful enough for their readers. * Increase in page rank and SEO - an advantage of article marketing is that if the articles are good enough, their search results will get higher ranks. This results in the company‚Äôs whole website to get a higher rank since those articles have backlinks to the website. * Inexpensive marketing - article marketing is one of the least expensive ways marketers use to market their product or service. Once your article is published, it stays there as long as the website is up and running, it also gets indexed in search engines and thus with nominal time and effort you gain to achieve a free advertising tool. * Articles may go viral - if a company writes a great article, it may become viral and they would get a lot of readers and their site traffic would increase as well. An article going viral can create a lot of advantages for the company in the long run. While there are many advantages to using article marketing, there are some downsides as well: * Stolen content - if a company uses article marketing, they publish their article to another website. Some editors may omit the company‚Äôs resource box, which makes the whole article marketing useless for the company. The company may not get the credit and site traffic that they deserve. * Can be expensive - a company might need a ghostwriter to help them write a great article that would lead customers into their website. Hiring a freelancer can cost the company some money especially if they want to hire a really good one. * Time-consuming - the process of presenting articles to distributors can be time-consuming. The company needs to plan to present new articles regularly and make time to write and submit those articles on time Traditional article marketing Article marketing has been used by professionals for nearly as long as mass print has been available. Business provides the content to a newspaper, possibly on a timely topic such as an article on tax audits during tax season, and the newspaper may use the article and include the business's name and contact information. Newspapers and other traditional media have limited budgets for gathering content and these articles may be used in the business section of the newspaper. Traditional article marketing is advertising a company‚Äôs article through the use of magazines, newspapers and any print media. (Daniels, 2013). This way of marketing has been going on for a really long time but it is still very much useful and still in style to this day. It still produces results in offline establishments. The method of doing the traditional article marketing is very straightforward. The company will choose a print media business they want to work with and discuss the conditions of the article they want to produce. Once the article has been written, the print media will then print and publish it. Both companies will benefit from this project. The print media company will have content to print and the business will gain exposure for their products and/or services. (Ekanem, 2015). Internet article marketing Internet article marketing is used to promote the authors' expertise of their market, products or services online via article directories. Article directories with good web page ranks receive a lot of site visitors and may be considered authority sites by search engines, leading to high traffic. These directories then give PageRank to the author's website and in addition send traffic from readers. Articles and article directories attract search engines because of their rich content. This practice may have been effective in the past, however, changes in Google's algorithms over the years have negated the benefits one would have received from this practice. Both Google's Webmaster Guidelines and comments by Google's Head of Webspam, Matt Cutts discouraged, if not outright prohibit, the strategy of using article directory marketing as a means to build backlinks.https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en Business Owners, Marketers and Entrepreneurs attempt to maximize the results of an article advertising campaign by submitting their articles to a number of article directories. However, most of the major search engines filter duplicate content to stop the identical content material from being returned multiple times in a search engine results page. Some marketers attempt to circumvent this filter by creating a number of variations of an article, known as article spinning. By doing this, one article can theoretically acquire site visitors from a number of article directories. Most forms of search engine optimization and internet marketing require a domain, internet hosting plan, and promoting budget. However, article marketing makes use of article directories as a free host and receives traffic by way of organic searches due to the listing's search engine authority. The primary goal behind article marketing is to get search engine traffic to the article so that the author can strengthen their authority and influence within their field, while also leveraging that traffic for their own site(s). The key to article marketing is that the author should be providing value with their articles, not just promoting their site, products or services.  Evolution  Article marketing has changed as companies have moved from targeting article directories such as Ezinearticles.com or eHow.com, to micro-targeting small audiences using Facebook and Twitter. Article marketing used to have a much broader target audience but companies have switched to more finite groups of consumers. The change happened because companies found that improving article quality and targeting a better audience was much more effective. Part of this is due to the face that, as of March 2017 the internet has over 3.74 billion users. Having such a massive market makes it hard to find the right customers, which caused companies using article marketing to shrink their scope and search for smaller audiences.  Significance  Article marketing is used to advertise cheaply. It is common for articles to get picked up by search engines, which allows for additional attention to a companies website. Article marketing is also very easy to perform and a great first step for a new business, which makes it very popular among small businesses. Article marketing has become so popular that many websites now have articles which teach easy steps on how to write your own marketing article to gain views from the public. Gaining views and attention to a website is important because websites gaining more traffic have a higher chance of getting purchases from the website according to statistics. Even if a website does not sell as many products on the website, the traffic a company gains will make the website more valuable. This will result in other companies seeking to pay for use of the website space for advertisements because of the larger amount of traffic the website receives.  Apps  Article marketing has also moved into phone and tablet applications also known as apps. App advertising is a very effective form of advertising, Milton Brown performed a study that people were twice as likely to purchase on their mobile phone when they see a Snapchat (a prominent phone app) advertisement. He also found that 92% of campaigns saw clear results after advertising on Snapchat. Because of this rising popularity of cheap/free advertisement on Apps companies have backlashed on article marketing since it is flooding applications. Facebook started banning Article marketing and other types of free advertisements in 2018 by increasing their prices and forcing free article evaluations to be stopped.

Instead, it was released on Gotee's imprint label, Mono Vs Stereo. Other than the instrumental \\"The Bois D'arc Circus\\" being added onto the end of \\"Pulling Back The Skin\\" to make one track, adding two new songs, and the cover art and title being changed, it is the same record. The other songs, with the exception of tracks 4 and 9 (which are the new songs featured on the re-issue) are the same recording of the previous album. The band calls this an album, but admits is not really an entirely new album. The band does play the song \\"The Invisible Hook\\" at shows, and the song is played on Christian radio stations, so the album has become as popular as their previous releases.

The term Winnebago was widely adopted by the surrounding Algonquin tribes as well as by the French, although the Ho-Chunk Nation have always called themselves Ho-Chunk. The other federally recognized tribe is the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. The tribe separated when its members were forcibly relocated first to an eastern part of Iowa known as the Neutral Ground, then to Minnesota, South Dakota and later to the current reservation in Nebraska https://www.wpm.edu/index.php/plan-visit/educators/wirp/nations/ho-chunk . The name Ho-Chunk comes from the word Hocaagra (Ho meaning \\"voice\\", cƒÖk meaning \\"sacred\\", ra being a definitive article) meaning \\"People of the Sacred Voice\\". Land base The Ho-Chunk Nation is considered a \\"non-reservation\\" tribe with many tribal members who privately own their own land, and the tribe stewards and maintains parcels of land placed in Trust as Indian Trust Land as designated by the federal government, Secretary of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) spread over Adams, Clark, Crawford, Dane, Eau Claire, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Marathon, Monroe, Rock, Sauk, Shawano, Vernon, and Wood counties, Wisconsin. In 1990, the land designated as trust land was in size.. Government The Ho-Chunk Nation is headquartered in Black River Falls, Wisconsin. With the adoption of its most recent constitution in 1994, which restored the tribe's name from the Wisconsin Winnebago back to its own name for itself, the Ho-Chunk Nation, the modern tribal government structured itself after the federal and state governments, with executive, legislative and judicial branches. All of the tribe's members make up the fourth branch of government, the general council. The current administration is as follows. * President: Marlon WhiteEagle * Members of the Legislature: Karena Thundercloud (Dist. 1, also serves as Vice President); Hinu Smith (Dist. 1); George Stacy (Dist. 1); Stephanie Begay (Dist. 2); Conroy Greendeer, Jr (Dist. 2); Kristin WhiteEagle (Dist. 2); Darren Brinegar (Dist. 3); Sarah Lemieux (Dist. 3); Larry Walker, Jr. (Dist. 3); Paul Fox (Dist. 4); Matthew Mullen (Dist. 4); Kathyleen LoneTree-WhiteRabbit (Dist. 4); Robert Two Bears (Dist. 4) * Supreme Court: Hon. Todd R. Matha, Chief Justice; Hon. Tricia Zunker, Assoc. Justice; Hon. David J.W. Klauser, Assoc. Justice  Culture  The Ho-Chunk relied on agricultural products for subsistence, including corn, squash, beans, and other products which they stored in fiber bags and pits dug in the ground for winter use. They traveled up the Fox and Wisconsin rivers to hunt both small and large game, crossed the Mississippi to reach the prairies to hunt buffalo, and also fished in nearby rivers and lakes. The Ho-Chunk held many ceremonies. The major summer ceremonial was the Medicine Dance, which included a secret ceremony for members of the Medicine Dance Society, a religious society open to both men and women, as well as public rituals. The winter feast was a clan ceremony intended to increase war and hunting powers; the spring Buffalo Dance was a magical ceremonial for calling the bison herds. Ho-Chunk women were responsible for growing and gathering food for their families, including agricultural products and a wide variety of roots, nuts and berries, as well as sap from maple trees. In addition, women learned to recognize and use a wide range of roots and leaves for medicinal and herbal purposes. Women also cooked game and prepared food and meals for the hunters to sustain them while traveling. They also tanned the hides to make clothing and storage bags. Ho- Chunk men were hunters as well as warriors in times of conflict. As hunters, they would catch fish by spearing them and clubbing the fish to death. The men would also hunt game such as muskrat, mink, otter, beaver, and deer.Radin, Paul. \\"The Autobiography of a Winnebago Indian,\\" American Archaeology and Ethnology 16.7 (1920): 381-473 Leaders among the men acted in political relations with other tribes. Some men created jewelry out of silver and copper that both men and women would wear. To become men, boys would go through a rite of passage at puberty, fasting for a period, in hopes of acquiring a guardian spirit.\\"Winnebago History and Culture\\". www.nanations.com.

They also own numerous restaurants and hotels connected to the casinos, as well as numerous gas stations. The Ho-Chunk Nation is the largest employer in Jackson and Sauk, employing roughly 3100 people. History The Ho-Chunk Wazijahaci have an extensive oral history and tradition that dates back thousands of years. There are stories that mention living through three ages. When Jean Nicolet landed in 1634 he thought he was landing in China. Oral history suggests some of the tribe may have been forcibly relocated up 13 times by the US federal government to steal land, which is estimated at 30 million acres in Wisconsin alone. In the 1870s, a majority of the tribe returned to their homelands in Wisconsin. Under the Homestead Act, some tribal members gained title to parcels of land.

The causes may be thought of as the input to the program, and the effects may be thought of as the output. Usually the graph shows the nodes representing the causes on the left side and the nodes representing the effects on the right side. There may be intermediate nodes in between that combine inputs using logical operators such as AND and OR. Constraints may be added to the causes and effects. These are represented as edges labeled with the constraint symbol using a dashed line. For causes, valid constraint symbols are E (exclusive), O (one and only one), I (at least one), and R (Requires). The exclusive constraint states that at most one of the causes 1 and 2 can be true, i.e. both cannot be true simultaneously. The Inclusive (at least one) constraint states that at least one of the causes 1, 2 or 3 must be true, i.e. all cannot be false simultaneously. The one and only one (OaOO or simply O) constraint states that only one of the causes 1, 2 or 3 must be true. The Requires constraint states that if cause 1 is true, then cause 2 must be true, and it is impossible for 1 to be true and 2 to be false. For effects, valid constraint symbol is M (Mask). The mask constraint states that if effect 1 is true then effect 2 is false. Note that the mask constraint relates to the effects and not the causes like the other constraints. The graph's direction is as follows: Causes --> intermediate nodes --> Effects The graph can always be rearranged so there is only one node between any input and any output.

His name was likely derived his name from the town of Potton in Bedfordshire, England. He was chosen in 1256 to succeed Peter de Ramsay, who had just died, as Bishop of Aberdeen. John of Fordun noted that, although an Englishman, he took an oath of fidelity to King Alexander III of Scotland before taking up his bishopric. There are no details of how Potton had managed to get himself in a position to take up such a prestigious post. Potton's episcopate is rather obscure, though his few years in charge seem to have been very significant ones for the history of the bishopric. He is said in one account to have united the churches of St Mary's and St Machar's into one cathedral, and he is also credited with making the parish church of Crimond into Aberdeen's fourteenth prebend. Two different dates have been given for his death. Walter Bower states that it was 1270, and the Aberdeen Registrum gives 26 April 1272. His successor Hugh de Benin was consecrated in the summer of the latter year.

The film portrays the movements of society and art in the Taish≈ç period from the viewpoint of Akiko Yosano. Plot One month after falling in love with the writer Hiroshi Asano, Akiko leaves her parents to move to Tokyo to be with him. After they marry, Akiko faces gossip that she drove Hiroshi's wife away. Upset at her poetry, some Japanese citizens consider Akiko a traitor and set fire to her house. Hiroshi grows poor attempting to continue circulation of the magazine Bright Star. After attending the opera, Akiko is knocked over by a motorcycle driven by the author Takeo Arishima. He sends her a Western outfit as an apology gift but she brings it back to his home to return it to him. The editor Akiko Hatano pressures Arishima to provide an essay about suicide for her publication but he is reluctant to do so. Hiroshi runs for election to the House of Representatives, funded by the uncle of Tomiko Yamakawa, Akiko's former romantic rival. Akiko makes negative statements about the campaign and Hiroshi eventually loses, but chooses to stay with Tomiko while she recovers from tuberculosis. The actress Sumiko hangs herself after her lover Hogetsu commits suicide. At the memorial service, Arishima asks Akiko to come with him to his father's farm at the foot of Mount Y≈çtei in Hokkaido. Akiko tells her children that she will return by Sunday. In Hokkaido, Arishima is briefly arrested for holding a socialist meeting with the farmers. Tomiko dies and Hiroshi returns home. Akiko returns home from Hokkaido days later than expected and her children have grown to hate her for her selfish actions. Arishima and the editor Akiko Hatano decide to commit suicide together. They stop themselves at the last moment several times until they are caught in an embrace by her husband, who threatens to sue for adultery. They then hang themselves together at Arishima's home. After the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake destroys the Yasano home, Akiko reads that her friends the anarchist Sakae Osugi and Noe Itou have been executed by the police. When she sees two of their anarchist friends being dragged by chains behind mounted police, she rushes to give them some rice balls and encourages them to live on. Akiko and Hiroshi commit themselves to living on and rebuilding their home.

History The Riihim√§ki railway station is one of the original stations on the main railway track from Helsinki to H√§meenlinna, opened in 1862 (see Helsinki‚ÄìRiihim√§ki railway). The town was originally built because of the railway. In 1870, a track to Saint Petersburg, Russia, was built (see Riihim√§ki‚ÄìSaint Petersburg Railway). The amount of traffic increased, and by the 20th century, Riihim√§ki became an important crossing- point station. In 1907, a narrow track to Loppi was built, but it was discontinued in 1952. The track was electrified in 1972. By the late 20th century, the railroad traffic from Riihim√§ki south towards Helsinki started to become overloaded, so a more direct track to Lahti was built. When it was completed, the long-distance rail traffic eastwards toward Russia switched to this new track. Now only local trains and cargo trains travel between Riihim√§ki and Lahti. The Riihim√§ki railway station is currently under renovation work during which the platforms are raised and the platform shelters, lifts and the station lights are renewed.https://vayla.fi/helsinki- riihimaki/tyot-riihimaen-alueella#.XZL5xugzZPZ vayla.fi (in Finnish) Retrieved 2019-10-01 Train connections Helsinki commuter rail: * R-line trains (Helsinki-Riihim√§ki-Tampere) *D-line trains (Helsinki-Riihim√§ki) *T-line trains (Helsinki-Riihim√§ki, nighttime) *G-line trains (Riihim√§ki-Lahti) Long- distance: * InterCity and Pendolino trains (Helsinki-Tampere, Helsinki-Pori, Helsinki-Jyv√§skyl√§-Pieks√§m√§ki) * Overnight trains to Lapland (Helsinki-Kolari, Helsinki-Rovaniemi-Kemij√§rvi)  Departure tracks  There are eleven tracks at the Riihim√§ki railway station of which six (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11) have platforms for passenger trains. * Track 1 is used by southbound long-distance trains and some of the commuter trains (R, T) to Helsinki. * Track 4 is used by northbound long-distance trains and a couple of R-line commuter trains to Tampere. * Track 5 is used by commuter trains to Helsinki (D, R, T) and to Tampere (R). * Track 7 is used by some few commuter trains to Helsinki (R, D) and to Lahti (G). * Track 8 is used only by G-line commuter trains to Lahti. * Track 11 is a temporary platform track used mostly by the G-line commuter trains during the station renovation.

Kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, 1995 The species name undulatus originates from the Latin word for wave, and refers to the wave-like pattern on its plumage. Taxonomy All tinamous are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, 2003 =Subspecies= * C. u. manapiare is only known with certainty from the vicinity of the Ventuari River in northern Amazonas State in Venezuela, but probably also occurs in southwestern Amazonas State.Hilty, 2003 * C. u. simplex occurs in southern Guyana, French Guiana (where only known from sight records) and northeastern Brazil (east of the Rio Negro and north of the Amazon River).Restall, Rodner & Lentino, 2006Davies, 2002 * C. u. adspersus occurs in Brazil south of the Amazon River, from the Tapaj√≥s River to the Madeira River. * C. u. yapura occurs in southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, northeastern and east-central Peru, and western Brazil (east to Rio Negro and the Pur√∫s River).Schulenberg et al., 2006 * C. u. vermiculatus occurs in eastern Brazil from Maranh√£o, Tocantins, and Mato Grosso and east. * C. u. undulatus occurs in southeastern Peru, eastern and northern Bolivia, the Pantanal region in Brazil, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. However, the exact distribution limits of some of the subspecies are unclear. Notably the population between the Madeira and Pur√∫s Rivers (between generally reported range of C. u. adspersus and C. u. yapura), and the population between the Tapaj√≥s and Araguaia Rivers (between generally reported range of C. u. adspersus and C. u. vermiculatus) appear not to have been assigned to subspecies. Description The undulated tinamou is approximately in length,Harrison, C. (1993) and weighs around . Depending on subspecies, it is overall brownish tinged grey to various extend, and has a strong, black barred to faint vermiculated pattern on the back and neck (for example, while C. u. undulatus is relatively rich brown and strongly barred, C. u. yapura is darker, more grey-tinged and only has faint vermiculations). It has a whitish throat, and the remainder of its underparts are olive-grey to buff with dark vermiculation on its lower flanks and vent. Its bill is black above and grey below. The legs and feet are grey, dull yellow or greenish.Sick, 1993 Behavior The nest of the undulated tinamou consists of a depression on the ground, where the female lays around three glossy vinaceous pink or light grey eggs. The incubation time is 17 days in captivity.Cabot, 1992 It feeds on small fruits, seeds and insects. As other tinamous, the undulated tinamou is secretive, and more frequently heard than seen. The song, commonly given throughout the day, consists of a deep, three or four noted whistle, which has been described by the onomatopoetic com-pra pan (\\"buy bread\\" in Spanish) or Eu sou ja√≥ (\\"I am Undulated Tinamou\\" in Portuguese). Habitat The undulated tinamou occurs at altitudes of up to . It occurs in a wide range of wooded habitats, ranging from dense, humid Amazonian forests, to dry, relatively open savanna-woodland. Although most of the range of the undulated tinamou is in the Amazon Basin, significant parts are in drier habitats such as the Cerrado (most of the range of C. u. vermiculatus is in the Cerrado region). Though generally considered resident, minor seasonal movements between habitats do occur locally. Conservation Though heavily hunted in some regions, the undulated tinamou remains common in most parts of its range. The IUCN classifies it as Least Concern, and its range of occurrence has been estimated to .BirdLife International, 2008a Footnotes References    * External links *Undulated Tinamou videos, photos & sounds on the Internet Bird Collection *Photo of Crypturellus u. undulatus.

Recurring sketches =A= * Al MacAfee ‚Äì A parody of Joe Louis Clark, David Alan Grier plays a strict, yet clueless shop teacher with a bad hip. He is known for working as a Hall Monitor and using a bullhorn to yell at innocent students and teachers, while being oblivious to bad things going on around him, as well as the consistent rejection by a fellow female teacher (played by Kim Wayans), with whom he is infatuated. Various cast members portray students and teachers who put up with Mr. MacAfee. * Andrea Dice Clay ‚Äì Kelly Coffield portrays the female counterpart of raunchy, wise-guy comedian Andrew Dice Clay. With sayings like \\"Ya think that's easy to do when you're stacked like this?\\" and \\"The last time I saw something like that, it had an eraser at the end of it.\\" A related set of skits featured Coffield as \\"Samantha Kinison,\\" a female version of rage- filled comic Sam Kinison. Kinison himself appeared in a sketch, where Samantha Kinison is revealed to be his wife. * Anton Jackson ‚Äì Damon Wayans portrays a filthy, drunken homeless person (he lives in a corrugated cardboard box) with a unique world view. Amongst other happenings, he appeared in Po' People's Court (taken from The People's Court), had his own Public-access television cable TV show entitled This Ol' Box (taken from This Old House), and had a marriage of convenience. He frequently carried with him his \\"personal facilities\\", a jar that he used as a toilet and which seemed to contain a floating pickle and brine (probably meant to represent urine and a turd). The character was also shown on an episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Damon Wayans where Anton testifies in the O.J. Simpson trial, and was also briefly in 1992's Mo' Money featuring Damon and younger brother Marlon Wayans. * Arsenio Hall ‚Äì The former late-night talk show host is played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, complete with a long index finger and prosthetic rear end. Many of Hall's mannerisms are incorporated into the sketches, including his riotous laugh and dance and the phrases \\"I haven't seen it yet, but my people tell me...\\" and \\"strive to be number one.\\" Hall is also portrayed as being obsessed with his Coming to America co-star and friend, Eddie Murphy. * Ace and Main Man ‚Äì Jamie Foxx and Tommy Davidson play of a pair of bouncers who never seem to let anyone in the club that should be let in, because they don't think it's that person. Often enough, they run into the featured celebrity (Johnny Gill, Tupac Shakur, and others) and proceed to deny them (for the same reasons) to the point where a fight is about to break out. Then, when their boss (or news reporters covering the event) comes out, Tommy's hyper-active character flips on Jamie's character, leaving Jamie to humiliation, and Tommy's character going into the club, only to be immediately kicked out himself. =B= * Mr. and Ms. Brooks ‚Äì Kim Wayans and David Alan Grier play a seemingly loving elderly couple who constantly insult and attempt to kill each other. After numerous failed attempts, they resort to attacking each other, such as when Ms. Brooks realizes her husband had laid a trap for her and she pulls out a sword and says \\"Prepare to Enter the Dragon!\\", prompting Mr. Brooks to reply \\"The only thing I see draggin' around here is your saggy breasts!\\" Their old age causes them to fall to the ground and be unable to get up, when they are interrupted by someone who is under the impression they are about to engage in sexual intercourse. They usually end with \\"And we stiiiiilll together!\\" * Benita Butrell ‚Äì Kim Wayans portrays a neighborhood woman who breaks the fourth wall by gossiping directly to the viewer and airing her neighbors' dirty laundry after they pass by her...but she \\"ain't one to gossip, so you didn't hear that from me.\\" She claims to be very close to a \\"Miss Jenkins\\", who ironically is usually the target of her most vicious gossip. * The Brothers Brothers ‚Äì Two brothers both named Tom Brothers (Damon and Keenen Ivory Wayans) who discuss black issues despite not realizing they are black. The pair were a parody of the Smothers Brothers; the original sketch had them hosting their own TV show, akin to The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Some episodes included their double dating, or applying to a country club and failing to notice its clandestine whites-only policy. Each episode ended with the Brothers being handed an acoustic guitar and upright bass and singing a song summing up the racial lesson of their show. The songs were dubbed by the Smothers Brothers themselves. * Background Guy ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a guy who does wacky funny stuff while news anchors are doing serious news commentaries. In one sketch he was a football player doing goofy antics while sports anchors are doing the halftime report during the Super Bowl; in another that featured the White House Press Secretary, he was doing even more bizarre things such as joining in a kickline of can-can dancers or recreating George Washington crossing the Delaware River. =C= * Calhoun Tubbs ‚Äì David Alan Grier portrays an old bluesman whose songs invariably insult or otherwise offend his audience. Catchphrase: \\"I wrote a song about it. Like to hear it? Here it go!\\" (His catchphrase would later be used as the intro to En Vogue's \\"Free Your Mind\\".) He always strums the same bar of blues and ends his little songs with a falsetto \\"Ahhhh haaa\\", and concludes with a shouted \\"Thank you very much!\\". He once claims to have written over 12,000 songs (none of them over 13 seconds long) and sold more records than Michael Jackson and the Beatles in upper New Jersey. David Alan Grier based the character on the famed Ann Arbor, Michigan personality \\"Shakey Jake\\" Woods, with whom he was familiar from his days at the University of Michigan. * Candy Cane ‚Äì Alexandra Wentworth portrays a host to a children's television show. Candy has serious adult issues that she brings up on the would-be kiddie show, such as getting stood up on dates and men who had sex with her and never called her back. However, she still manages to smile and present the show like a female Mr. Rogers. Marc Wilmore appears as 'Jurassic Benny' a purple dinosaur (obviously a reference to the famous Barney from Barney & Friends). Candy loves him and Benny often rejects her on camera, then she gets angry and calls him out for him leaving after they've had their most recent affair off screen, to where the actor pulls off the mask and tells her to leave him alone. * Carl \\"The Tooth\\" Williams ‚Äì Jamie Foxx portrays a boxer a la Mike Tyson who has lost every bout he's been in. He is always getting beaten up by everyone he comes in contact with. One commentary said he looks like \\"a Ringling Brothers clown that got run over by a truck\\". The name is a takeoff on heavyweight boxer Carl \\"The Truth\\" Williams. Catchphrase: \\"Hollerin' 187 wit' my glove in ya mouth\\" is paraphrased from a line by Snoop Dogg in the Dr. Dre single: \\"Dre Day\\" One distinct physical characteristic of Carl's besides his prominent tooth, is his jheri curl. * Cephus and Reesie ‚Äì Kim Wayans and David Alan Grier play a pair of incredibly annoying soul singers, modeled slightly after Ashford & Simpson. Episodes with Cephus and Reesie included them mistakingly performing at a Bar Mitzvah, an advertisement for an album of theirs, which is eight CDs long due to them breaking songs such as \\"Silent Night\\" by one of them asking \\"If it was a silent night, how could it have been a holy night?\\", and an episode where they sing an extended rendition of \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" for a Death Row convict (Jim Carrey) who (regrettably) is granted his last wish to hear some live soul music before he dies that very night. Cephus and Reesie were also said to have jammed with Frenchie and appeared in an off-Broadway show called \\"Get Off the Lord's Bus If You Ain't Got Correct Change.\\" * Cheap Pete ‚Äì Chris Rock (when he guest starred during the final season) as a cheapskate who won't pay more than $1.25 for anything. His catchphrase is \\"Good Lord that's a lot of money!\\" The Cheap Pete character is based on and originated from a bit part Rock played in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. Cheap Pete was also featured in Rock's film \\"CB4\\" and an audio track from his 1997 album \\"Roll with the New\\". =D= * \\"The Dirty Dozens\\" ‚Äì Stu Dunfy (Nick Bakay) hosts a game show that is a cross between Jeopardy! and Concentration (though some episodes are modeled after Wheel of Fortune and the Pyramid game shows hosted by Dick Clark) in which contestants are involved in a battle of insults. Two of the contestants that appear in almost every \\"Dozens\\" skit include returning champion T-Dog Jenkins (Jamie Foxx) and unlucky-with-categories contestant Amfeny Clark (Reggie McFadden). Variations include Family Dozens and Wheel of Dozens. In one episode, Ed O'Neill guest starred as himself, portraying the show's \\"all- time champion\\" and defeating T-Dog. * Duke and Cornbread Turner ‚Äì Jamie Foxx plays a senior citizen named Cornbread who performs tricks with his dead German shepherd named Duke (whom he believes to be still alive). In one skit Duke was shown to be the father of a litter of puppies (also deceased). In another sketch it is revealed that Duke's real name is Jeremy Jolly Rancher Remington Steele Lewy Cadburry the 3rd to the 4th power. A running gag features Cornbread mistaking people he meets for children who died in tragic accidents. His catchphrase is \\"I'll be John Brown\\". * \\"Dysfunctional Home Show\\" ‚Äì An alcoholic, depressed, and incestuous divorced father named Grandpa Jack McGee (Jim Carrey) hosts a housekeeping show, along with his promiscuous daughter (Alexandra Wentworth), her abusive boyfriend-turned-husband (Jamie Foxx), and Grandpa Jack's drunken, hateful mother (Kelly Coffield). Grandpa Jack also had a son who was not screwed up like the rest of the family, and had to guide him away from his drunken mistakes, such as Grandpa Jack starting to shadow box when he heard an oven timer, and the son yelling offstage that is not a boxing bell, but the chime of an oven. The trademark quip for this show is that Grandpa Jack would say \\"pork and beans\\" in a slurred tone (and then he would repeat it again by shouting it), as the family often dined on that particular dish. =E= * East Hollywood Squares ‚Äì An urbanized version of the original (1966‚Äì1981) Hollywood Squares, with Peter Marshall as himself, along with such occasional real-life celebrities as Gary Coleman and Fred Berry. Cast members portrayed actors and actresses such as Dr. Dre (David Alan Grier), Antonio Fargas (Tommy Davidson), Little Richard (Jamie Foxx), Garrett Morris (Jamie Foxx), and Isabel Sanford (Marc Wilmore). Morris and Foxx later worked together on The Jamie Foxx Show. * Ed Cash and Carl Pathos ‚Äì Co-pastors of the \\"First Church of Discount Sin\\" and crooked televangelists, with Damon Wayans as Cash, the afro-wearing pastor who names and shames people who don't deliver their required tithes, speaks in nonsensical tongues, sells indulgences, and heals parishioners by taking their wallets. Pathos (pronounced in a way that it sounds like \\"Pesos\\" with a lisp), portrayed by Jim Carrey, is a pastiche of televangelists such as Robert Schuller and Jimmy Swaggart (in one sketch quoting Swaggart's \\"I have sinned\\" speech) with unusual tics and numerous sexual perversions. Cash and Pathos co-hosted a number of television shows, including The 595 Club (a discount version of The 700 Club) and a straight parody of the Hour of Power in which Cash resorts to robbing the congregation when the necessary tithes don't come in; in each sketch, Pathos usually ends each service with a parody of a Southern gospel tune. In a later sketch, Cash and Pathos are called before Congress to account for their questionable practices. =F= * Fire Marshal Bill Burns ‚Äì Jim Carrey portrayed a crazed, masochistic (and supposedly immortal) fire marshal with a manic grin and laugh along with a scarred face whose safety advisories usually include demonstrating (on himself) the very disaster he's warning against. (Every sketch illustrates a timeline of readily-visible damage on Bill from previous episodes). Usually, the warnings are against ridiculous situations that would never come to pass, such as an alien crab-people invasion, a sex doll that was accidentally inflated with hydrogen instead of air which then exploded due to static electricity, or an outbreak of psychotic elves. Every sketch ends with Fire Marshal Bill blowing up the facility he's teaching at, to which the people involved look at the burning facility and either lament what will become of them or simply stare in shock while Fire Marshal Bill says a witty comment and (sometimes) leaves to do more \\"safety advisories\\". Despite each sketch showing him lose parts of his body (in one sketch, only his head remained), Bill never dies. In one episode when on a cruise, he had a blonde wife named Ashley (a play on the term ash) who also was seemingly immune to the damage Bill caused. Her face was similarly scarred like Bill's was and she was a party to his demonstrations (spreading gasoline in a life raft to prove Bill's point about the danger of flare guns). His catchphrases included \\"Lemme show ya something!!\\", \\"Everybody remain calm... I am a Fire Marshal!\\" and \\"It can be very, very DTUHHH-DTUHHH ... DEADLY!\\" * Frenchie (Keenan Ivory Wayans) ‚Äì An obnoxious, but happy-go-lucky \\"Partay Animal\\" with a flair for blending the fashion of the late 1970s with that of the early to mid-1980s (his attire consists of red platform shoes, a red pleather suit with yellow vinyl fringe, long jheri curls, sunglasses and gold chains). Frenchie somewhat resembles Rick James and seems to turn all events, even an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, into parties. Frenchie says he owns an AMC Gremlin that has had a car boot on it for a long time. He also claims to have jammed with Cephus and Reesie. His catchphrase is \\"... 'Cause I'm hip, I'm slick, and all the women love my (fill in the blank)\\". In fact, on Frenchie's second appearance in which he toasts a friend's bachelor party, he did say towards the end of the skit ‚Äì \\"...'Cause I'm hip, I'm slick and all the women love my ‚Äì ...y'all fill it in.\\" * Funky Finger Productions (\\"Black- Strong\\" also called \\"B.S. Brothers\\") ‚Äì Two showbiz charlatans, Clavell (played by David Alan Grier) and Howard Tibbs III (played by Tommy Davidson), with a knack for commandeering events (a funeral, a Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony) and property (a movie set), both public and private, or Keenan Ivory Wayans' monologue, to promote their latest flim-flam \\"project\\". The would-be moguls enter by shouting \\"this must be the place!\\" in unison. They claim to have managed a band of 16 horn players called \\"Satern\\", but later had to fire ten horns. From there, they undermine their grandiose pitches with ill-conceived videos, business cards with their mothers' address and telephone number, or business cards of other businesses such as carpet cleaners with the proper business crossed out and their names written on it, and reliance on public transportation. Another stunt was for one of them to have their phone number shaved into their hair, which quickly turned into a basketball afro. Their spiel invariably climaxes when Tibbs stuns the unsuspecting mark by suddenly pulling out an item integral to the sales pitch (e.g., business card, sales brochure, video cassette) while simultaneously shouting \\"BAM!\\". =G= * Great Moments in Black History ‚Äì Either Tommy Davidson or David Alan Grier, in a quasi-serious tone of voice, narrates reenactments of dubious moments in African-American history. Examples include the accidental invention of the jheri curl (when motor oil leaked on a Jiffy Lube worker's large afro during an oil change), the first Def Comedy Jam (where a man resembling Martin Lawrence, played by Foxx, while putting up a banner, accidentally hit his hand and started cursing, much to the audience's delight), the first party DJ (a man named Ho accidentally bumps into a record player and scratches the record), the first black astronaut to be abandoned on the Moon, and the advent of the self-serve gas station, where a rude service station worker yells to a customer \\"Get it yo' damn self!\\" :The format of this sketch is likely an inspiration for several segments and skits on Grier's 2008 Comedy Central program Chocolate News. This sketch has since been replicated on Chappelle's Show. * Groom Room: An inner city barber shop plays host to David Alan Grier as an incompetent barber. Unsuspecting customers, who sit in his chair against the advice of a much more seasoned barber (Jamie Foxx) are asked how they want their hair cut. Grier's character, unable to hear, asks questions such as \\"You want your name across the back?\\" and \\"You want a tail down the back?\\" before becoming frustrated and ordering the customer to point to a poster showing hair styles. The barber will then massacre the haircut, much to the anger and outrage of the customer. The barber will then demand \\"Where's my tip, Sucka?\\" to the customer storming out of the barber shop. The premiere \\"Groom Room\\" skit featured Cuba Gooding Jr. as a patron in the barber shop while a later skit featured the famous singer James Brown in a cameo. =H= *Handi Man ‚Äì Damon Wayans portrays a handicapped superhero (possessing super-strength, flight, invulnerability and several other powers), who sometimes has a midget sidekick (Tiny Avenger, played by Debbie Lee Carrington). He attempts to foil villains, between bouts of uncontrollable drooling. Major villains include Isadora and Doctor Naughty; the former has attempted to eliminate Handi Man and the Tiny Avenger, or kidnap a ballerina to steal her dancing abilities, while the latter is a villain who hates handicapped people and sees Handi Man as his main adversary. Doctor Naughty concocted plans such as making an evil robot double of Handi-Man to simultaneously destroy Handi-Man's good name and rob from the March of Dimes vault, or using an attractive female nurse to seduce Handi-Man into wearing \\"kripple-nite\\" and rendering him powerless. His secret identity was \\"Clark Bent,\\" (a play on Superman's secret identity Clark Kent) a mail courier at the Daily Glove newspaper. It was one of the sketches that generated a large amount of controversy for the show due to the spoofing of those with disabilities, but remains one of the best known sketches of the show. * Head Detective ‚Äì Damon Wayans portrays a police detective who, due to a horrific accident, is merely a head attached to a pair of feet and tiny hands and appearing similar to Mr. Potato Head. Along with his full-bodied partner (played by Keenen Ivory or Marlon Wayans), he solves crimes, often catching the perpetrators by being thrown, kicked, or bowled toward them. * Hey Mon ‚Äì Damon Wayans heads the hard-working West Indian Hedley family, each with many careers. With his \\"lazy good-for-nothing\\" son (Tommy Davidson) who wears traditional dreadlocks, they find nothing more appalling than meeting people with two or fewer jobs (including small children), regardless of how much money they make in those one or two jobs. Some sketches would show the family owning their own business, such as a hospital or an airline, with a joke being that multiple responsibilities would all be filled by the family members. A sketch would usually end with the family breaking the fourth wall and yelling to the viewer \\"Hey mon, got to go to work!\\", as calypso music ends the sketch. * Homeboy Shopping Network ‚Äì Two streetwise pitchmen named Whiz and Iceman (Damon and Keenen Ivory Wayans) use a Home Shopping Network-style approach to sell stolen goods. The phrase \\"Mo' Money, Mo' Money!\\" was coined in this sketch (even though Wayans originally said this on a Weekend Update segment on Saturday Night Live back when he was a feature player in the 1985‚Äì1986 season). The time limit imposed on sales was typically due to the impending arrival of the police. The concept was created by Howard Kuperberg, one of the show's original writers. *Homey D. Clown ‚Äì Damon Wayans plays an ex-con who works as a clown (real name Herman Simpson) for his parole agreement, but lashes out at anyone (usually by hitting them on the head with a sock full of pennies) who attempts to make him perform the standard antics of the role ‚Äì \\"I don't think so! Homey don't play that!\\". His goal in life is to get even with \\"The Man\\", a personification of the white male establishment who are \\"holding him down\\". Near the end of most sketches, Homey would lead a group of children (played by the cast members) in a call and response sing- along, which would end with him degenerating into a rant, then intimidating the children into repeating after him. One of the most popular characters in the show's history, Homey was the only In Living Color character to get his own video game. =I= * Ice Poe ‚Äì Shawn Wayans plays a violent street poet who recites eloquent threats to get what he wants. He is usually foiled by an equally poetic undercover cop (David Alan Grier). =L= * Lashawn ‚Äì T'Keyah Crystal Keym√°h plays various customer service jobs, giving major ghetto sassy attitude to the customers. The clips always end with her leaving for her lunch break, usually leaving the customer hanging. She was sometimes accompanied by a goofball who would always claim he had experience from being with \\"me and Larry\\", but would screw up simple tasks, such as burning a hamburger and saying \\"I got experience in a striped grill, not one that is flat!\\" * Les and Wes ‚Äì Damon and Keenen Ivory Wayans portray a pair of conjoined twins attached at the side. Wes is a celebrity, while Les is not, often having a job unrelated to Wes'. * Little Miss Trouble ‚àí Kelly Coffield plays as Edna Louise, an elementary school troublemaker. Edna constantly makes trouble for her teacher (Kim Wayans, done up to be a frumpy schoolteacher) and classmates, particularly a dorky classmate named Parnell (Jim Carrey) with whom she constantly squabbles. * Loomis Simmons ‚Äì David Alan Grier plays a shady infomercial host shilling out ridiculous products and services. Examples include ineffective self-help audio tapes and \\"Custom Built Condoms\\" that only fit Mr. Simmons. =M= * Men on... (Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier) ‚Äì In this parody of Siskel & Ebert, a pair of extremely effeminate gay men, Blaine Edwards and Antoine Merriweather, review topics completely based on their potential for homoerotic content. Variations of this sketch include Men on Books, Men on Television, Men on Fitness, Men on Vacation, Men on Art, and Men on Football. It was the source of many popular catchphrases such as, \\"Hated It!\\" (used for any film/book/program centered on one or more female characters), \\"Fish!\\", \\"My second favorite form of liquid protein\\", \\"Three words‚Äîfa ‚Äì bu ‚Äì lous!\\" and \\"the yet unheard of Zorro snap, in Z formation!\\" (Nearly every episode featured some variation of their \\"two snaps up\\" finger- snap gesture of approval.) In a two-part season-ending cliffhanger sketch, Blaine gets hit on the head by a stage light and gets a sort of amnesia, making him straight and conventionally \\"macho\\"; Antoine tries to restore his normal personality by hitting him in the head with a frying pan and a cinder block, both of which failed. His personality is only restored after being hit in the face by Antoine. The characters were resurrected for an episode of SNL hosted by Damon Wayans, and again when David Alan Grier hosted SNL. The theme song to the pair's \\"show\\" was \\"It's Raining Men\\" by The Weather Girls. * Music Video Parodies ‚Äì Cast members regularly performed \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic-type takeoffs on songs while portraying the singers who made them popular. Two of the most memorable parodies were \\"White, White Baby\\" featuring Jim Carrey riffing on Vanilla Ice's \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" and \\"Baby's Got Snacks\\" by Trail Mix- A-Lot, a parody of \\"Baby Got Back\\" by Sir Mix-A-Lot. Other parodies included \\"Black or White\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" by Michael Jackson (with Tommy Davidson playing Jackson), \\"Gypsy Woman\\" by Crystal Waters and parodied by Kim Wayans, \\"Promise of a New Day\\" by Paula Abdul (with Kelly Coffield as Abdul) \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" by Whitney Houston (with Kim Wayans playing Houston), Snow's \\"Informer\\" (with Jim Carrey as Snow), and \\"Me Want Maury\\", a parody of \\"Me So Horny\\" mocking Maury Povich (Jim Carrey) and Connie Chung's (Steve Park) attempts to conceive a child. Sometimes the person being made fun of in the song was not the original artist, as was the case in the parody of LL Cool J's \\"Mama Said Knock You Out\\" (Shawn Wayans impersonated Jimmie Walker, better known as J.J. Evans from the 1970s TV series Good Times) and Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation\\" (Kim Wayans portrayed Houston in that video). =O= * Oswald Bates ‚Äì Damon Wayans plays an eloquent prison inmate whose vocabulary is full of malapropisms, more often than not misusing anatomical terms and words for bodily functions. \\"Unfortunately, we could not impregnate everyone. It is simply beyond our colonic threshold.\\" \\"I believe it was Plato ... No, excuse me, I mean Play-Doh ... who stuck to the wall when he said one must not put one's transvestite in jeopardy if one is to become a cunning linguist\\". * Overly Confident Gay Man ‚Äì Jim Carrey portrays a gay man who recently came out of the closet, and wants everybody to know it. =P= * Richard Pryor ‚Äì Damon Wayans impersonates Richard Pryor, specifically the exaggerated nervous energy he was known for in his comedies such as Superman III and The Toy, by showing Pryor in his kitchen preparing a bowl of cereal while expressing concern that something bad was about to happen. Pryor was making comments such as \\"Oh no!\\" and his known facial expressions when he was sent on a wild slapstick stunt. A narrator says \\"Richard Pryor is Scared for No Reason\\"! =S= * Seamus O'Shanty O'Shame (a.k.a. The Depressed Irish Singer) ‚Äì In the fifth and final season, Jay Leggett was one of the only new cast players to be given the opportunity to provide a new regular character to the show. In his case, Seamus was somewhat of a white counterpart to David Alan Grier's \\"Calhoun Tubbs\\" character, whereas he would sing songs that had a shock value by the end of the song. Seamus O'Shanty O'Shame is a quintessential \\"rogue\\" Irish man with a heavy accent who sings with an acoustic guitar, usually in front of groups of people who are part of social service programs, but is later found out to be an escaped mental patient running from the facility in which he belongs. Unlike Calhoun Tubbs, Seamus' songs were not as short, nor did they have a catchy sendoff. Instead, Seamus would lead into his songs with an introduction (saying \\"... and it goes something like this ...\\"), start off his songs in a beautiful mood, and then conclude them with graphic depictions of injury and death, usually ending it off with \\"... and he died!\\" or \\"That's it!\\". * Snackin' Shack ‚Äì Kim Wayans plays an obnoxious, hard-of-hearing waitress at a greasy spoon diner, who refers to herself only as \\"Mama\\". Running gags included her giving patrons used water, serving contaminated food, pulling salt & pepper shakers or utensils out of her bra, and spanking customers who misbehave, telling them \\"Mama gonna have to spank you!\\" The chef, Luther (Tommy Davidson), who is hard of hearing, hits the desk bell on the counter, announces entrees that were never ordered, and yells \\"Pick it up!\\", often leaving a pile of unwanted entrees in the kitchen window. When a customer with a complaint asked to speak to the owner, he was directed to Leon (David Alan Grier) who always sits in the spot by the door and shouts outrageous phrases such as: \\"I can make a booger talk!\\" and \\"I got the toe jam; who got the peanut butter?\\" * Sweet Tooth Jones ‚Äì A send-up of blaxploitation films; Tommy Davidson plays a karate instructor with a balding Afro haircut who runs the \\"Hollywood School of Self-Defense\\", assisted by Sugar Bear (Marc Wilmore) and Queen Bee (Alexandra Wentworth), all of whom wear clothing from and speak slang of the 1970s, completely out of place with the people they are instructing. Running gags would include simulated the fight to knock out his assistant, but never really knowing how to actually fight. As he put it, \\"I am a fight choreographer!\\" =T= * Tiny / Prison Cable Network ‚Äì The prison sketches on In Living Color were never known by a particularly official name, but they always had a number of consistent inmates who bring their own unique personality ‚Äì i.e., depraved mindset ‚Äì to a television audience in the form of either a variety show or a game show. The regular inmates included Angel Martinez (Tommy Davidson)‚Äîa highly-energetic, happy-go-lucky Chicano with a witty sense of humor who tends to be the host of all the televised events they have, Charlie Magic (Jim Carrey)‚Äîa crazy, murder-obsessed psychopath whose name derives from Charles Manson, and The Death Row Comic (Keenen Ivory Wayans), who was so dangerous, he always had to be isolated from the audience behind a steel door with only his mouth showing through a slide window at head level. The end of his routine always seemed to end with him being taken away to his execution (whimpering with fear in the process), however he appears at least three times total. The standout prison character is Tiny, a convicted rapist (played by David Alan Grier) who always begins his sentences with \\"Uhh ... uhh ...\\" and is insanely obsessed with women's breasts, always using the term \\"big breasteses\\" accordingly. Tiny's breast obsession is so intense that, even while he tries to keep it under control, the orgasmic thoughts of the \\"breasteses\\" tend to get the better of him to the point where the nearest people would have to try and calm him down or carry him away. =V= * Vera de Milo ‚Äì Jim Carrey portrays a steroid- abusing female bodybuilder with a conspicuously flat chest and bulge in her posing trunks. Vera was best known by her unnaturally deep, breathy voice and grotesque, horselike laugh, along with a small set of pigtails. Vera de Milo often appeared in movie parodies of then-current films like Pretty Woman and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. * Velma Mulholland ‚Äì Kelly Coffield is a woman who looks and acts in the style of film noir movies, earning her the nickname the \\"Film Noir Girl\\". As such, she always speaks in long hyperbole monologues. A physical characteristic is that she always appears in scratchy black and white, reminiscent of old film footage, while the world around her remains in color (an effect achieved through the use of chroma key, requiring Coffield to wear clothing and body paint of the same color with avoidance of the same color elsewhere on the set). A theme with each of her sketches is that she always finds herself in a situation involving a modern black man who is at odds over melodramatic takes on the most mundane of things. =W= * Wanda ‚Äì Jamie Foxx portrays Wanda Wayne, the ugliest woman in the world...so ugly, in fact, that no one wanted to be in the same room as her (in one episode, Dracula exposed himself to sunlight to get away from her). She supposedly is the long lost member of the group En Vogue but left because she was taking all of the men. One of these helpless individuals is often Tommy Davidson. In the final season of In Living Color, Wanda had a child out of wedlock and searched for the father of her child Wanda Jr., which ended with her chasing after Barry Bonds' limo driver, who she believed was the father. Trademark phrase: \\"I'm gon' rock yo world,\\" \\"I'm red' to go!,\\" \\"Hey fo' real do,\\" \\"I got you,\\" and \\"Don't make me get ugly!\\" * Why? ‚Äì A series of public service announcement-themed sketches that asked a question that in and of itself was usually very intriguing, exemplified by the actors in an often exaggerated manner. For example, \\"Why do newscasters always attempt to sound ethnic when talking about stories dealing with Latinos? Why don't they do that with other ethnicities?\\" Another sketch, which lampooned Star Trek: The Next Generation, was then freeze framed into a \\"Why?\\" segment asking why black actors who play aliens on Star Trek look like they have feet or other body parts protruding from their heads, a likely reference to Worf. Notable one-time or infrequent sketches * All Up in the Family ‚Äì A black version of the 1970s CBS sitcom, All in the Family, which showed a black conservative Archie Bunker commenting on the ridiculousness of 1990s fads to his wife Edith. * Bob Jackson, Karate Instructor ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a karate instructor, who claims to be a former world champion, teaching a self-defense class for women. He proceeds to get stabbed twice accidentally by Kelly Coffield while attempting to show how to defend against a knife attack, and is eventually unmasked as a fake by the other students in the class. * The Buttmans ‚Äì A family modeled after The Cosby Show characters, only they have buttocks on their foreheads. The Buttmans fail to see the jokes directed at their strange appearance. In one episode, their daughter brings home her boyfriend Richard Dickerson (Jim Carrey) who has a very long nose that resembles a penis; the family comments on interracial relationships, rather than the fact his nose is uniquely shaped. * Cape Rear ‚Äì A parody of the 1991 Cape Fear remake (starring Nick Nolte and Robert DeNiro). This version focused on Arsenio Hall (Keenan Ivory Wayans) going to drastic measures to get close friend and fellow entertainer Eddie Murphy (Jamie Foxx) to appear on his hugely popular late-night talk show. * The Capital Hillbillies ‚Äì A parody of The Beverly Hillbillies with Bill Clinton, played by Jim Carrey. * Career Aid ‚Äì A parody of \\"We Are the World\\", with cast members mocking artists from the original song lamenting about their stardom passing them by. While Ray Charles is among the artists lampooned, it is David Alan Grier who plays the singer rather than Jamie Foxx, who would win an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charles in the film Ray. Foxx is Lionel Richie in the sketch. * Chris Rock For Anonymous Express ‚Äì Shawn Wayans portrays comic Chris Rock. In the sketch, the character of Chris Rock says white people do not recognize him on Saturday Night Live. When a security guard asks Rock to leave the NBC studios, Rock shows his I.D. and the guard says he has never appeared on Saturday Night Live. One future SNL alumna, Molly Shannon, briefly appears as one of the visitors. * Cousin Elsee ‚Äì Kim Wayans plays an annoying and unattractive woman who bothers everyone she meets. In an episode which showed a funeral, she appears saying that this is her fourth funeral today, and that the last funeral was catered by Taco Bell. * Dickie Peterson: Cherub of Justice ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a Guardian Angels reject who attempts to protect local businesses (and, in one sketch, a visiting off-camera President of the United States), but who usually causes more harm than he prevents. * Deboner 2000 ‚Äì Carol Rosenthal plays Lorena Bobbitt in a mock knife infomercial where she is brutally chopping phallic looking food and related items (pants, boxer shorts, and a gamecock). * Family Feud ‚Äì The Jacksons face off against The Royal Family in a fictional episode of the game. Ray Combs, host of Family Feud at the time, is the emcee. * Ghost II: Sammy's Visit ‚Äì T'Keyah Keymah portrays Whoopi Goldberg (in character as Oda Mae Brown) in a spoof of the 1990 hit film Ghost and Tommy Davidson portraying Sammy Davis Jr., who comes back from Heaven, to reunite with his wife Altovise (Kim Wayans). * Go On Girl ‚Äì A feminism show hosted by Shawanda Harvey (T'Keyah Crystal Keym√°h). * Grace Jones ‚Äì Kim Wayans parodies the actress as an extremely physical enthusiast of any activity (the sketch was not so much a spoof of Jones, but more so her characters Zula from the film Conan The Destroyer and May Day from the James Bond film A View to a Kill), whether be it fighting an alligator for her dinner or pro wrestling, while regularly asking \\"Do you find me sexy?\\". One parody involves the movie The Bodyguard in which Grace Jones plays the Whitney Houston character and Jim Carrey plays Kevin Costner complete with bad hair, and when Kevin Costner carries Whitney Houston off-stage in the original movie, the scene is reversed with Grace Jones carrying Frank Farmer off while singing \\"I Will Always Love You\\". * Hawaii Five-O ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays McGarrett in a parody of the long-running police drama. * Hemorrhoid Patient ‚Äì David Alan Grier is a patient who shows up at a hospital multiple times due to having a hemorrhoid and is constantly in the care of Nurse Peggy (Anne-Marie Johnson). He is usually placed on a gurney and temporarily left unattended while leaning forward with his gown undone, leaving his hemorrhoid exposed; because of this, many people look at it and are overwhelmed by its size and depiction. One group of people were Japanese tourists who stood next to the hemorrhoid and got their pictures taken with it. Others include rambunctious children prodding at it, a heart patient who laughed himself to death after seeing it, and was broadcast live for a local news channel. Cheap Pete (Chris Rock) makes a cameo and exclaims, \\"Good Lord, that's a might big hemorrhoid! Look like two ham hocks!\\". All the while, the patient gets upset when his hemorrhoid is seen and constantly calls for Nurse Peggy (who gradually becomes fed up with his complaints). * Home Alone Again (fictional preview) ‚Äì A send- up of both the hit film and star Macaulay Culkin's friendship with singer Michael Jackson. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays Culkin, who plays various pranks on Jackson (Tommy Davidson) who wants to come in and play with Culkin. The pranks include shooting him in the crotch and burning his hand and hair (the latter being reminiscent of a real-life injury Jackson sustained while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984). * The Honeymooners '93 ‚Äì A black and white parody of the 50s sitcom, but with the characters using hip-hop references. Ralph Kramden (Jay Leggett) enlists the help of a boombox-wielding Ed Norton (Jim Carrey) to learn how to be hip to impress his wife, Alice (Alexandra Wentworth). Examples include learning hip-hop dance moves, and trying to act black to relate to his boss (Tommy Davidson) to get a promotion at work. * I Love Laquita ‚Äì Kim Wayans plays the title character in this hip-hop flavored, but still black and white, spoof of the groundbreaking TV show I Love Lucy. Here, Ricky (Jim Carrey) has invited a famous producer over, and Laquita, along with Ethel (Kelly Coffield), hopes to audition for the producer, but soon they run into a case of mistaken identity when a TV repairman comes over before the producer does. Another notable instance of the sketch involved a case of mistaken identity with Keenen Ivory Wayans playing an escaped convict known as the \\"Billy Dee Williams Doppelganger Bandit\\" who robs Laquita's residence, but is suddenly stopped by an appearance of the real Williams. * Juicemania ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a surprisingly accurate impersonation of infomercial personality Jay Kordich, who uses an electric juicer to make juice from unlikely sources, such as garbage and soil. * King: The Early Years (one- time) ‚Äì In a sketch introduced as part of a fictitious series of Great American Profiles, the narrator leads the audience to believe that Martin Luther King Jr. got his start as a peacemaker between boys preparing to fight in a schoolyard ... until \\"King\\" is revealed as a younger Don King (Damon Wayans), complete with his iconic hairdo, who promotes the fight and even instigates it. Obviously anachronistic references are also made to boxers Leon Spinks and Gerry Cooney, as well as Robin Givens, ex-wife of Mike Tyson. * Kurt Singen ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a flamboyant environmentalist who is offended by everything he sees. He bears a passing resemblance to Freddie Mercury. At the end of the sketch, either he would be arrested for disturbing the peace or his moped would be stolen, which he would react to by saying \\"People, we must work together!\\" * Lamont Hightower ‚Äì (David Alan Grier) A flamboyant host presents televised events and programs celebrating black underachievement and the perpetuation of stereotypes, for example television awards for typecast characters such as \\"sassy neighbors\\" and \\"scared brothers on police shows\\". Another time Lamost hosted a \\"Miss Black USA\\" pageant hosted by a ghetto area of an unnamed city. * Lassie '90 ‚Äì A mother (Kelly Coffield) and her son (James Carrey) own a pit bull. When they get into trouble they ask their faithful companion to get them something needed to extricate themselves from the situation. The dog soon returns with the desired item, albeit still held by the severed arm of the original owner. * The Last Orphan ‚Äì David portrays a 35-year-old orphan, who never was adopted. He reveals that he is a graduate of the Yale University Acting School. When a couple tells him he is crazy, he comments \\"My ex-wife told me the same thing\\", indicating that he has adjusted to adult life but somehow feels his life is incomplete because he grew up without parents. * Late Night with Mike Tyson ‚Äì The boxer (Keenen Ivory Wayans) hosts a late-night talk show with Don King (Jamie Foxx) as his sidekick. Elements from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Late Night with David Letterman and The Arsenio Hall Show are incorporated into the sketch. * Lil' Magic ‚Äì Features Kim Wayans as a very tall girl without talent who always auditions for talent shows, accompanied by her overzealous stage mother, played by David Alan Grier (who is not much in drag as he retains his normal voice and does not wear makeup, which added to the comedy). Her common phrase was \\"I'm Miss Smile Bright 1987!\\" Then she makes a big smile. On certain occasions where she did achieve moderate success, she would revel in the newfound wealth with comments such as \\"Gee, Mama, maybe you can get the liposuction for your butt!\\" or \\"Gosh, Mama, maybe now you can get that other breast implant!\\", prompting the stage mother to reply \\"Lil' Magic, shut up!\\" * Lil' Richard's Playhouse ‚Äì Keenan Ivory Wayans portrays rock n' roll singer Little Richard as he hosts a storytime program. In the sketch, he attempts to tell the story of Cinderella, but he makes too many connections to himself that he stops reading and talks about the things he hasn't accomplished yet, such as not winning a Grammy yet. * Love Connection ‚Äì Jim Carrey portrays host Chuck Woolery, Kim Coles portrays Robin Givens, and Keenen Ivory Wayans portrays Mike Tyson in a parody of the television series of the same name. This is the very first aired sketch. In the second and final sketch, Kelly Coffield portrayed her character, Andrea Dice Clay while Jim Carrey played Patrick Swayze. * Magenta Thompson: Acting Teacher ‚Äì Kelly Coffield plays a middle-aged, semi-oblivious former actress who has taken up teaching the art of acting. In her classes, Magenta gives her all when demonstrating her acting abilities and her strong passion for the profession. However, she doesn't seem completely bothered that she was no more than a bit-part supporting actress who was always met with the line \\"Outta my way, bitch!\\" in every movie she appeared in, all of which she delights in showing to her students. * Making of a Tracy Chapman Song ‚Äì Tracy Chapman (Kim Wayans) promises her producer she will have a song written by the next day. For inspiration, she looks out the window and incorporates events like an old man getting hit by a bus and a domestic dispute into her new song, which is set to the tune of Chapman's hit \\"Fast Car\\". * Misery II ‚Äì A pseudosequel to Stephen King's Misery, where a woman is chained to her bed by Rick James (played by Keenan Ivory Wayans) who claims that \\"there's a party in my pants\\". When the woman tries to reason with him by saying that she liked MC Hammer's sample of Superfreak, it causes an enraged James to make the sophomoric comment \\"M.C. Hammer ain't nothing but a stinky pants doody!\\" In tribute to Misery's infamous sledgehammer scene, James returns with a hammer, saying \\"It is hammer time!\\", and the narrator comments \\"He is one funked-up host\\". * Mr. Armstrong ‚Äì A substitute teacher named Mr. Armstrong, who has two useless arms, one of which is limp, teaches a group of students who torment him by compelling him to perform various tasks with his useless, limp arm such as writing on the chalk board, pointing to places on a map, and covering his heart for the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Armstrong eventually snaps, saying \\"You little trouble makers, I didn't want to have to show you this side of me, but you forced my hand,\\" before using his limp arm to karate chop his desk in half, subduing the students into good behavior. * Naganawanaland ‚Äì Kelly Coffield plays a newly appointed U.S. ambassador to an obscure African nation, while David Alan Grier plays her interpreter whose translations don't quite match up to what the new ambassador is actually saying. * The New Fly Girls ‚Äì On 12 May 1991 broadcast, in the opening dance routine right after the credits, Kim Wayans, T'Keyah Keymah, and Kelly Coffield are shown dancing rather than the strangely absent Fly Girls. At the end of the dance routine, the girls nervously back up against the closet on the set's mock rooftop. Suddenly the closet bursts open, and it is revealed that the female cast members tied up the Fly Girls, duct taped their mouths shut, and stuffed them into the closet. Kim, T'Keyah, and Kelly look distressed, until T'Keyah shouts for the DJ to keep playing the song. The three girls finish their dance routine while the bound and gagged Fly Girls struggle to free themselves and (attempt to) shout for help. It appears that not all the Fly Girls were fully prepared for the sketch, because when the closet door opens and they all fall out onto the floor, you can see several Fly Girls still wrapping themselves in the rope or putting the pieces of tape over their mouths. * Old Train ‚Äì A parody of the music show Soul Train with Keenan Ivory Wayans as an elderly version of Don Cornelius. During the show's famous \\"Soul Train Line\\", some of the dancers include someone in a wheelchair, and pallbearers rolling a casket down the line. In the closing of the sketch, the \\"Grim Reaper\\" walks throughout the crowd. * Passenger 227 ‚Äì Parody of the 1992 movie, Passenger 57, T'Keyah Keym√°h portrays Jack√©e as Sandra from 227, in which the sketch focuses as Sandra, the Airline Security with other people being trapped with airline terrorists. * Pee-wee's Adult Adventure ‚Äì Pee-wee Herman (as portrayed by Jim Carrey) shills the new Pee-wee doll, updated with references to Paul Reubens' 1991 arrest for masturbating in a Florida theater. * Player's Club - Parody of the Player's Club Service, as advertised by Players International. Jim Carrey plays Telly Savalas, known for his commercial advertisements of the Player's Club; however, the Player's Club is now an actual club which Carrey uses to attack staff members at hotels and casinos when they do not offer first class accommodations or front row seats at entertainment shows. * Ross Perot ‚Äì Jim Carrey parodies Ross Perot by showing a program to the people of the NAACP a program acronymed SLAVE (Service Labor Asset Valuable Expenses) on the first episode of the fourth season. Another had Perot buying up airtime on all the channels and appearing in each one, until when the sketch ends and the usual showing of the Fly Girls dancing, Ross Perot is now the DJ of In Living Color. * Seamus O'Shanty O'Shame ‚Äì Jay Leggett, who was cast strictly in the fifth and final season, plays an Irish singer whose songs each begin with traditional, uplifting lyrics, but end with graphic lyrics, usually involving death or destruction. Each of his songs ends suddenly with \\"That's it!\\" It turns out that Seamus is a mental patient when two men in white uniforms arrive to capture him. * Sgt. Stacey Koon ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a parody of a sergeant in the LA Police Department in the Rodney King incident, who spits when he speaks. * Sheila Peace ‚Äì Kelly Coffield plays a woman who has a very stereotyped view of everyone she meets. In one sketch, she plays a realtor attempting to sell an apartment to an Asian couple, telling them the hard wood floors were good for them to practice karate on. When trying to sell the same apartment to an Indian man, she told him there was plenty of room for all his wives to come in and belly dance. * Snuf & Roam ‚Äì (Shawn and Marlon Wayans) A pair of immature brothers talk tough, but invariably get put in their place. One sketch dealt with them trying to hit on girls at a club, which Snuf says his full name is Snuffleupagus. Another had the brothers thrown in jail and trying to act tough in front of the other prisoners, only to later find out they were arrested for sneaking into the film Pinocchio without paying. * Star Trek: The Wrath of Farrakhan ‚Äì In this spoof of the original Star Trek series and the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Jim Carrey impersonates Captain Kirk with grossly exaggerated mannerisms, with David Alan Grier playing Mr. Spock and Kim Wayans as Lt. Uhura. Minister Louis Farrakhan (Damon Wayans) boards the Enterprise and convinces the minority and alien crew members to mutiny, becomes captain, and directs the Enterprise to 125th Street in Harlem, New York to Sylvia's Soul Food Shack. * Ted Turner's Very Colorized Classics ‚Äì Jim Carrey portrays film enthusiast Turner, only instead of colorizing black and white films, he replaces the white stars of those films with black actors. For example, one sketch replaces Humphrey Bogart with Billy Dee Williams (Keenan Ivory Wayans) in Casablanca. * Three Champs and a Baby/Little Lady ‚Äì Muhammad Ali (David Alan Grier), Sugar Ray Leonard (Tommy Davidson) and Mike Tyson (Keenan Ivory Wayans) care for a baby girl (a teenage girl in the \\"Little Lady\\" version). Tyson peppers his conversation with the words \\"ecstatic\\" and \\"ludicrous\\", and is punched by Ali whenever the doorbell (actually a boxing ring bell) is rung. Ali was shown having trouble speaking clearly, often saying sentences like \\"Float like a butter, stink like a tree\\", a likely reference to his issues with Parkinson's disease. Another skit where they were featured where the three champs appeared in fruit costumes, saying \\"We are the Fruit of the Loom boxers!\\" * Timbuk: The Last Runaway Slave ‚Äì Damon Wayans plays the descendant of cave-dwelling runaway slaves, unaware of changes in the world around him since the 1860s. Before his \\"Pappy\\", who raised 3 generations of runaway slaves, passes away, he tells Timbuk it's time to leave the cave. After exiting the cave Timbuk encounters a businessman (David Alan Grier) who he thinks is a \\"free black\\". A white jogger running by bumps into the businessman. Timbuk immediately apologizes while the businessman stands up to the jogger and the two exchange words. Timbuck grabs the businessman telling him white folk like to be right even if they are wrong. The jogger leaves and a few moments later dogs are heard barking. Timbuk grabs the businessman and goes behind a bush. A white women with two small dogs walks by. Timbuk tells the businessman to stop staring at her as she walks away. The businessman tells him he can have a white woman if he so desires. The jogger returns with police to take the businessman away due to the earlier altercation. Timbuk throws himself down full force on the ground begging for mercy. When the police tell Timbuk he is not under arrest and is free to go, he believes he has been freed. The skit ended with a cliffhanger that was never resolved. * Umbilical Barry ‚Äì Jim Carrey plays a young college age kid still attached to his overprotective mother (Carol Rosenthal playing the stereotype of the Jewish mother) literally by the umbilical cord. * Unpoetic Justice ‚Äì T'Keyah Crystal Keymah portrays R&B;/Pop singer Janet Jackson, Jamie Foxx as rapper Tupac Shakur, and Anne-Marie Johnson as Regina King, in the popular 1993 film, Poetic Justice. This dubious parody reenacts scenes from the film, such as Janet and Tupac's verbally abusive arguing, and mostly voice-overs done by Janet Jackson, who has been scolded by Tupac, by never \\"bein' in the 'hood\\". * Vortex of Fear ‚Äì A take-off on The Twilight Zone, with Tommy Davidson as the Rod Serling-esque narrator. In the sketch, a man (Jim Carrey) is hypnotized so that he clucks like a chicken. Before the hypnotism can be reversed, the hypnotist (David Alan Grier) suddenly drops dead. Unable to communicate normally (even his writing consists of clucks), the man ends up homeless. * Vortex 2 ‚Äì A parody of tampon commercials with Kelly Coffield and Kim Coles sunbathing at a swimming pool. Coffield tells Coles that she'd like to take a swim, but that her period prevents her from doing so. After using Vortex 2 at Coles' suggestion, Coffield returns and dives into the pool, causing the water in the pool to vanish. * Wile E Coyote - Jamie Foxx portrays a jaded parody of Wile E Coyote (who insists on being called \\"Willy\\" Coyote) who is vocally and visibly tired of being a cartoon character. Jay Leggett also appears in these sketches as another Looney Tunes character (either Elmer Fudd or Yosemite Sam). Bolt 45, The Lost Sketch * On 5 May 1990 broadcast, Keenen Ivory Wayans did a take-off on a Billy Dee Williams \\"Colt 45\\" commercial (in which the purpose of the beverage is to get your lady friend wasted) that ended with a woman (played by Kim Coles) passed out on her back on a dining table, and \\"Billy Dee\\" moving in on her unconscious body to have sex with her. The \\"Bolt 45\\" sketch was seen only once during the original broadcast. The sketch was omitted from repeats because some felt it was making light of date rape. The Season One DVD set of ILC didn't include the \\"cut\\" sketch from the pilot. This skit was cut by Fox censors, and the necessary modifications were made to the master tape, but Keenen \\"accidentally\\" mixed up the masters, and the original master was broadcast. That segment has never been broadcast since, not even in syndication or on FX or BET. It has been replaced by The Exxxon Family (a fake promo for a sitcom about a clumsy Exxon boat captain (played by Jim Carrey)) in syndication and DVD Box Sets.

Gameplay As in Omaha Hold 'em, the player must use both of the cards in his hand in combination with the three cards on the board. The game is played with 28 cards: eight through ace, in all four suits. The ace can be played as a low card, as though it were a seven, or as a high card. The game uses an ante, and is usually played with a no limit structure.Pokertips.org: Spanish Poker All players are dealt 2 cards pre-flop and are then allowed to bet. After the flop there is another round of betting. Then one card is flipped (the turn) and there's a third round of betting before the flipping of the last card (the river) and the final round of betting. After betting is done, all players show their cards and whoever has the best hand wins the pot. In some cases the pot has to be split. The poker hand ratings are the same as Texas Hold 'em except that a flush beats a full house.

Makor Issues & Rights, 551 U.S. 308 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled on the interpretation of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995's requirement of scienter in a civil action in apply to Tellabs and Makor Issues & Rights.OYEZ article The various federal circuits have taken different approaches to defining what it means, under the PSLRA, for a plaintiff to sufficiently plead a \\"strong inference\\" of scienter (a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud). The Court ruled a reasonable inference of scienter from assumed-true facts was insufficient and inconsistent with Congressional intent. Writing for the Court, Justice Ginsburg wrote that \\"to qualify as ‚Äústrong‚Äù within the intendment of ¬ß 21D(b)(2), we hold, an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable - it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent...the inference of scienter must be more than merely ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù or ‚Äúpermissible‚Äù-it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\\"Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2504-05 (2007). Tellabs increased the hurdle civil litigants must traverse in order to recover damages for securities fraud because it made it more difficult to demonstrate scienter (a necessary element of the claim). Instead of being able to reasonably deduce scienter from the alleged facts of the case, a claimant must also demonstrate that fraud is at least as likely as other, more-innocent explanations.

His background and origins are obscure. He was the son of a \\"cleric in minor orders\\" and an unmarried girl and, according to John of Fordun, he was of \\"noble birth\\". He was probably the son of Ness de Ramsey, a baron of Fife. The first notice of him comes in 1247 when, as a mere deacon, he is elected to succeed Radulf de Lamley as Bishop of Aberdeen. The chapter of Aberdeen wrote to the Pope requesting papal dispensation for Ramsay's illegitimacy as well as permission for the consecration to take place in Scotland. Upon receiving news of Ramsay's consecration, Pope Innocent IV wrote to David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews, Clement, Bishop of Dunblane, and Albin, Bishop of Brechin, delegating the matter to them and instructing these bishops to make their own judgment on the matter, after which, they were to receive Ramsay's oath in his name. The result of this is shown by Ramsay's successful accession to the bishopric. During his episcopate he became one of the royal councillors appointed by Henry III of England in 1255 for the minority of King Alexander III of Scotland. He sanctioned Alan Durward's endowment of a chaplaincy of \\"Logydurnach\\" (Logie-durno) in 1251, and was alleged have sanctioned a constitution for his diocese. He died in late 1256.

Academic career Ramsay studied at Victoria University of Wellington, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, as well as a Diploma of Education and a Diploma of Teaching from Wellington Teachers' College. His MA thesis, supervised by Ian McLaren and completed in 1969, was titled Planning, policy, and practice in Maori education, 1936‚Äì1968, and examined some of the reasons for the relative underachievement of MƒÅori in education at that time as identified by the Hunn Report. He later completed a DPhil at the University of Waikato. Ramsay was a faculty member of the School of Education at the University of Waikato, rising to the rank of professor. His educational research and publications were across a broad range of topics, including preschool education, MƒÅori education, curriculum development, teaching training, nursing education, the impacts of new technology on teaching, and the socialisation of teachers. Early in his career, while he was a primary school teacher in Wellington, Ramsay became active in the New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI), and from 1968 to 1970 he was the first curriculum officer of the NZEI. Between 1970 and 1974, he served on the NZEI's Waikato branch committee, and was a member of the national executive between 1975 and 1981. Between 1987 and 1988, Ramsay was a member of the Picot task force, established by the New Zealand government to examine the school system with a mandate to examine management structures and cost-effectiveness. In 1976, Ramway was made an associate fellow of the NZEI, and in 1986 he was made an honorary fellow of the NZEI. He was made an honorary fellow of the University of Waikato in 2000. In the 2007 New Year Honours, Ramsay was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services. Daffodil breeding With his wife Lesley, Ramsay gained an international reputation for showing and hybrising daffodils, registering 116 daffodil hybrids between 1992 and 2018. Two of these, \\"Blossom Lady\\" and \\"Cameo Magic\\", were awarded First Class Certificates at the National Daffodil Society of New Zealand (NDSNZ) daffodil awards, in 2007 and 2013, respectively. In 2008, Ramsay was awarded the gold medal of the American Daffodil Society, and in 2013 he won the Peter Barr Cup from the Royal Horticultural Society, for contributions to the advancement and enjoyment of daffodils.

Don Devoto was a member of the elite of Buenos Aires. In respect of his help to Italy during World War I he was given the title of count by the king. Don Devoto built what was the largest mansion at the time and it became known as Devoto Palace-- Prince Umberto Saboya stayed there during a visit to Buenos Aires. The mansion was built on National Avenue and occupied around 10,238 square metres. The mansion was decorated in bronze, silver and gold with iron work forged in Italy, and Florentine mosaics. Don Devoto died in 1916 before the work on the mansion was complete and since he did not leave any descendants, and no one could be found to buy the eccentric house, so in 1938 it was divided into building lots on which houses were later constructed.

Kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Taxonomy Jorupe Preserve - Ecuador This is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Description The pale-browed tinamou is approximately in length. It is recognized by its greyish-brown upper coat which is finely vermiculated with black, and a white throat, with the remainder of its underparts greyish to buffy. Its flanks are barred, and it has a very brown crown, and a prominent white supercilium. Its legs are pink. Behavior Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Like other tinamous, the pale-browed tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes, and small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 5 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat The pale-browed tinamou is found in subtropical and tropical arid forests up to altitude. This species is native to western Ecuador; southern Manab√≠, Guayas, coastal and extreme western El Oro, and extreme northwestern Loja, and northwestern Peru; Tumbes and western (except coastal) Piura.BirdLife International (2008) It inhabits the Ecuadorian dry forests and Tumbes-Piura dry forests ecoregions. Conservation The IUCN classifies the pale-browed tinamou as Near Threatened, as their numbers are decreasing. It is currently threatened by widespread deforestation and habitat degradation caused by livestock overgrazing, and also logging. This species is also threatened by people hunting it for food. It also is suffering losses due to farming, however this is the least of the threats. The occurrence range of this species is .

He was the first person born in the Americas to become a governor of a European colony in the New World, serving two terms as governor of Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata, 1597‚Äì1599 and 1602‚Äì1609, and one of the Governorate of Paraguay 1615‚Äì1617. Early life Hernandarias was born in Asunci√≥n, colonial Paraguay as the second son of Mar√≠a de Sanabria and Mart√≠n Su√°rez, an officer under √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca. He had a sister, Juana de Saavedra, who later married Juan de Garay, the father of Jer√≥nima de Contreras. His maternal grandparents were Diego de Sanabria and Mencia Calder√≥n de Sanabria, who were wealthy from their holdings in Paraguay. He entered the military at an early age. He participated in the exploration and conquest of the territory of what is now Paraguay and Argentina. His talents as an officer and administrator led to his being named lieutenant-governor of Asunci√≥n in 1592 by Juan Ram√≠rez Velasco. He served three terms. While claiming most officials from Spain or Peru were lazy or corrupt, the new governor Diego Rodr√≠guez Vald√©s Vanda y Lugarteniente wrote about Hernandarias: {  : Solo en Hernan Darias hab√≠a vencido la virtud. Aunque los espa√±oles lo tachan de que se inclina siempre a los criollos y mestizos, es muy honrado Cavallero, aunque criollo, porque no hay regla sin excepci√≥n.  : Only in Hernan Darias has virtue triumphed. Although the Spanish fault him as being inclined always toward the criollos and mestizos, he is an honorable gentleman, for in every rule there is an exception. } In the same period, Hernandarias' half-brother, Hernando de Trejo, was named bishop of the Roman Catholic see of Asunci√≥n. Governor of Rio de la Plata In 1596 Hernandarias was elected as Lieutenant-Governor of the Rio de la Plata province, including Buenos Aires. In 1597, upon the death of governor Vald√©s Vanda, King Phillip II ordered captain Francisco de Barraza to name a new governor of the province of Rio de la Plata. Hernandarias was elected unanimously by the caudillo in Asunci√≥n as the governor of Rio de la Plata province, including Buenos Aires. Monument to Hernandarias in Montevideo Hernandarias served three terms as governor: 1597‚Äì1599, 1602‚Äì1609, and 1615‚Äì1617. As governor, he enacted a number of policies to stimulate the growth of what was at that time a small port town. These included the creation of the first primary schools, kilns for creating bricks and tiles to replace adobe as a construction material, and the rebuilding of a fortress to protect the city from pirates. Following the capture of two anchored ships by English privateers on March 18, 1607, he ordered the construction of a larger fort at the mouth of the Matanza River, in what is now the neighborhood of Vuelta de Rocha. He also enacted measures against smuggling caused by prohibitions on import, export and the African slave trade. During his term as governor of Buenos Aires, Hernandarias started several expeditions, including ones to Uruguay and Brazil to rein in the Portuguese bandeirantes, explore the Patagonia, survey the navigability of rivers and to find the mythical City of the Caesars. Eventually in 1604, he was captured by the native Mapuche around 1,000 km south of Buenos Aires. He escaped and survived. In 1603, Hernandarias changed the rules on Amerindian workers, ending the mita and encomienda labor systems. The Spanish had essentially depended on native labor in exchange for nominally converting them to Christianity. He gained approval for this reform from King Phillip III. In 1608 he arranged the creation of the Jesuit and Franciscan reductions in the region of Guayr√° (modern Paraguay). While it relocated many natives, compared to the previous system, it protected them from the ranchers and the encomienda. In 1611, visiting judge Francisco de Alfaro ordered the emancipation of all natives working on encomiendas who had been converted by the Jesuits. His proclamation is known as the Ordenanzas de Alfaro. As Governor of the Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata, Hernandarias at the beginning of the 17th century opposed the burgeoning mate industry. He thought it was an unhealthy bad habit, and that too much of the Indian workforce was consumed the drink. He ordered an end to the production in the Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata, while seeking approval from the Crown. It rejected his ban, as did the people involved in production, who never complied with the order.L√≥pez, Adalberto. \\"The Economics of Yerba Mate in Seventeenth- Century South America\\", in Agricultural History. Agricultural History Society 1974. Cathedral of Buenos Aires Hernandarias was directly involved in the relocation of the church in Buenos Aires in 1603. In 1616 craftsmen determined that the church's roof was deteriorating, and, in the course of repairs, the church collapsed. 1618 Hernandarias led the effort to construct the Cathedral of Buenos Aires. Working with carpenter Pascual Ram√≠rez, Hernandarias secured a supply of lumber from Paraguay as well as labor from Spanish colonists and converted natives. On the construction of the Cathedral, Hernandarias wrote in a letter about the construction of the Cathedral: {  :... la hice derribar y fabriqu√© de nuevo (...) y as√≠ este templo con todos los dem√°s de esta Provincia, de pueblos indios como de las ciudades, hasta la Catedral, puedo decir que las he fabricado no s√≥lo con el trabajo y constancia de mi persona, sino a costa de mi hacienda.  : ... my deeds demolished and rebuilt (...) and on this temple, and all the rest of the province, from Indian towns to the cities, to the Cathedral, I can say that I have built them not just with my work and perseverance, but at the expense of my estate. } Official decrees On September 7, 1614 Hernandarias was named governor of Buenos Aires for his third and final term. He assumed the post on May 29, 1615. He introduced an initiative to split the R√≠o de la Plata district in two: the Province of Buenos Aires, and the Province of Paraguay, including the settlements of Asunci√≥n, Santiago de Jerez, Villa Rica and Ciudad Real. Though ordered in 1617, the partition needed the approval of the king, which was granted in 1618. The change was not carried out until 1620. After the expiry of his term in 1617, Hernandarias was succeeded as governor by Diego de G√≥ngora.

Figueroa, New York, 1893 Marriage and family In his personal life, he was married to Jer√≥nima de Contreras with whom he had three daughters: Ger√≥nima, Isabel and Mar√≠a Hernandarias retired with his wife to Santa Fe, Argentina, where he died in 1634 at the age of 72. His remains and those of his wife were interred at the convent of San Francisco, in Santa Fe. Legacy * The Hernandarias District of Paraguay was named for him, as were the city of Hernandarias, Argentina in Paran√° District, and the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel in Argentina.  Cattle introduction in the Banda Oriental  In 1604 Hernandarias traveled six month along Uruguay and Negro rivers looking for wood, coal and canes supplies on the Uruguay River Eastern Bank (Spanish: Banda Oriental). On his return to Buenos Aires he reported to King Felipe III of Spain describing those lands as excellent for cattle raising, and suggesting they be populated. The King didn¬¥t heed his advice but in 1610 he deeded Hernandarias with the \\"Natural Peoples Protector\\" title and two islands at the confluence of Uruguay and negro rivers, present day Vizca√≠no and Lobos islands. In 1611 Hernandarias disembarked fifty heifers and some bulls in Lobos Island and reached an agreement with the natives to protect animals with calves. He repeated the operation in 1617 with another fifty animals and the same number in San Gabriel Island on the Colonia coast. This act originated a great cattle herd in the region, the exploitation of which was determinant in the historical processes lending to colonization of present day Uruguay, so far overlooked by Spaniards.

Adjustable-length collar stay A collar stay, collar stick, collar tab (British English), collar stiffener, or collar stiff is a shirt accessory consisting of a smooth strip of rigid material, rounded at one end and pointed at the other, inserted into specially made pockets on the underside of a shirt collar to stabilize the collar's points. The stays ensure that the collar lies flat against the collarbone, looking crisp and remaining in the correct place. Collar stays can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (such as brass, stainless steel, or sterling silver), horn, baleen, mother of pearl, or plastic. Shirts often come with plastic stays that may eventually need to be replaced if they bend; metal replacements do not have this problem. Collar stays can be found in haberdashers, fabric- and sewing-supply stores and men's clothing stores. They are manufactured in multiple lengths to fit different collar designs, or may be designed with a means to adjust the length of the collar stay. There are many variations to the traditional collar stay. Some metallic collar stays are sold with a magnet, which is used to hold the stiffened collar in place against the shirt. A different type of collar stay discreetly adds a button hook on one end, to help fasten tiny buttons on dress shirts; e.g. placket, cuffs or button down collars. Adhesive collar stays can be stuck to the underside of a collar to either add stiffness or attach the collar points to the shirt. Collar stays are removed from shirts before dry cleaning or pressing, as the cleaning process can damage both the shirt and the stays; they are replaced prior to wearing. Shirts that are press ironed with the collar stays are vulnerable to damage, as this results in a telltale impression of the collar stay in the fabric of the collar. Some shirts have stays which are sewn into the collar and are not removable.

He was the father of John McClelland (1766-1849), who became an officer during the War of 1812. American revolution In 1776, McClelland's Fort, an early army outpost, was built on a cliff near Royal Spring Park, Georgetown, Kentucky. The fort was abandoned in 1777, however, after Indian attacks increased in frequency and severity. John B. McClelland may have been involved in surveying the land, or possibly building a nearby log cabin. Though, it's more likely that a cousin, by the name of John McClelland (1745‚Äì1776), was actually responsible. A monument to Scott County's fallen soldiers of the Revolution now marks the location.Gelbert, American Revolutionary War Sites, Memorials, Museums and Library Collections: A State-by-State Guidebook to Places Open to the Public, 42.Kleber, The Kentucky Encyclopedia, 591.

The Convention met in Philadelphia, July 15, 1776, to form a constitution and frame a government for the state of Pennsylvania. A committee of prominent citizens met at Carpenter's Hall, Philadelphia, on June 15, 1776, in order to make arrangements for a convention anticipating the separation of the colonies from Great Britain. Attendants were asked by the committee \\"to choose such persons only to act for them in the ensuing convention as are distinguished for wisdom, integrity, and a firm attachment to the liberties of this province.\\" In pursuance of this recommendation, delegates were chosen July 5, 1776, and the eight delegates to the convention elected for Westmoreland County were John Moore, Edward Cook, James Perry, James Barr, James Smith, John Carmichael, John McClelland, and Christopher Lobingier.Boucher, History of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, Volume I, Chapter XXIII: \\"Bench and Bar.\\" pp. 322‚Äì323. =Westmoreland Militia= At the outset of the Revolutionary War, McClelland was appointed to a citizen's committee to procure arms and ammunition for the defense of the struggling new nation.

McClelland later became a Captain in the First Battalion of Westmoreland Militia, a unit which was prominent in the Siege of Yorktown.Pennsylvania State Archives, Revolutionary War Military Abstract Card File. Series #13.50.Boucher, History of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, Volume I, Chapter IX: \\"The Beginning of the Revolution.\\" p. 129. However, it was actually his son, John McClelland (1766‚Äì1849), who helped illustrate the unfair nature of the taxes imposed during the Whiskey Insurrection.Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Archives, Volume IV, Series II: \\"Papers Relating to What is Known as the Whiskey Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania.\\" p. 212-215, 233. Officers of the Westmoreland Militia met on June 18, 1781, at the home of Captain John McClelland, on Big Sewickley Creek, and by a majority, voted to give aid to General George Rogers Clark. It was resolved to furnish 300 men out of the County Militia to join General Clark's army against the Ohio savages, for the immediate benefit of the Westmoreland frontier; despite the fact that Clark's real intention was to conquer the British post at Detroit.Hassler, Old Westmoreland ‚Äì A History of Western Pennsylvania During the Revolution, 134. Although George Washington agreed to transfer a small group of regulars to assist Clark, the detachment was defeated in August 1781 before they could meet up with Clark, effectively putting an end to the campaign. =Crawford expedition= By 1782, the Indians of the frontier allied themselves with the British and started attacking settlers. McClelland was commissioned a Major,Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Archives, Volume II, Series VI: \\"Battalions Not Stated Westmoreland County Militia.\\" p. 385. and made third in command of an expedition, led by Colonel William Crawford, intended to put an end to Indian attacks on American settlers in that region. In fact, John McClelland was one of four majors elected for the Crawford Expedition. The other Majors included David Williamson (Pennsylvania) of Washington County, Pennsylvania, Thomas Gaddis of Westmoreland (now Fayette),Butterfield, An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782, 77. and James Brenton also of Westmoreland County (now part of Washington County, Pennsylvania).Crumrine, History of Washington County, Pennsylvania, 115. By that time, McClelland was certainly no novice in military affairs, having been a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Fourth Battalion of Militia of Westmoreland County, to which he was elected on January 3, 1778.Butterfield, An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782, 123. He was a brave and efficient officer, and much respected as a citizen. His election as one of the general officers of the expedition, at Mingo Bottom (present Mingo Junction, Ohio), was evidence of the confidence reposed in him by the volunteers, with many of whom he was personally acquainted.Butterfield, An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782, 123. Upon learning that a British detachment from Detroit was about to join forces with the Wyandot Indian forces, and that a large band of Shawnee warriors had also appeared to the south, Colonel Crawford commenced a retreat, with Major John McClelland leading the way. However, the volunteer army was soon attacked by the Shawnee and Delaware Indians, and suffered severely. McClelland was wounded and fell from his horse. Calling to John Orr, who was near, he told him to take his horse (Orr was on foot) and clear himself, which he did.Brown, The Battle of Sandusky: June 4‚Äì6, 1782. Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine 65 (April 1982), 142. Orr afterward related that he heard several of the men who were in the conflict say that the horsemen on the retreat rode over McClelland; and it was the general belief that he was killed where he fell. Such, however, was not the case.Butterfield, An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782, 221‚Äì223. The remainder of the division became disorganized and panic-stricken and disregarding McClelland's orders to follow the advance in a solid column, did not follow the prescribed route, becoming entangled in the wetlands.Ellis, History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, Chapter XI: \\"The Revolution.\\" p. 99. John Slover, one of the guides on the Crawford Expedition, saw McClelland's body at Wapatomica. The Indians had painted his body black, cut him with their tomahawks, and burnt holes with loads of gunpowder into it. His body was cruelly mangled; the blood mixed with gunpowder and was rendered black. McClelland's body, along with the body of William Harrison, Colonel Crawford's son-in-law and the body of young William Crawford, the Colonel's nephew, was dragged approximately two hundred yards outside of the town. The corpses were given to the dogs, except their limbs and heads, which were mounted on poles.Butterfield, An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782, 345‚Äì347. Young William Crawford, William Harrison, and Major John McClelland all lost their lives at the hands of the Delaware and Shawnee Indians. Colonel Crawford was brutally tortured and burnt at the stake.Ellis, History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, Chapter XI: \\"The Revolution.\\" p. 108. According to Fitzpatrick, the Shawnee Indians were led by Chief Blacksnake. Memorial A government-issued marker honoring Lt. Col. John B. McClelland has been installed where his wife, Martha Dale McClelland (1741‚Äì1822); son, John B McClelland (1766‚Äì1849); and daughter-in- law, Rachel Orr McClelland (1770‚Äì1843); are buried, at Tenth Presbyterian Church Cemetery (275 Tent Church Road, Uniontown, Pennsylvania).

History  Lower Columbia College was established in 1934 as Lower Columbia Junior College. Students registered for classes at Korten's Music Store in Longview, Dahlman Hardware in Castle Rock, and the Orr Furniture Store in Kelso. Classes were held at R.A. Long High School. The first class to graduate with an Associate degree was in 1936; the class consisted of seven students. The second class, with ninety-six students, graduated in 1937. As the number of students increased, instruction expanded into the Myklebust building in downtown Longview and the Moose Hall. The Moose Hall continued to house classes until the 1949 Olympia earthquake, when damage caused the building to be condemned. Classes were also held on the first floor of the Longview Public Library. Enrollment was 149 students in 1939, 200 students in 1950, and 300 students in 1954. The student population consisted of both male and female students. In 1948, the college received its first accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. In 1942, twenty-six acres were purchased from the Longview Company to build a campus. In 1950, construction began on Old Main, LCC's first permanent building. The original building had thirteen classrooms and cost a quarter of a million dollars. The Lower Columbia College League, an association of friends of the college, used fundraising to pay for the construction. Lower Columbia Junior College became part of the Longview School District and changed from a junior college to a community college in 1961. LCC joined the state-supported community college system in 1967. Today, the college includes twenty-six buildings on 38.75 acres and enrolls between 4,000 and 5,000 students each quarter.  Foundation  The Lower Columbia College Foundation was formed in 1976 with the help of Phillip and Jeanne Wertheimer.  University partnerships  Students can earn bachelor's and master's degrees through the Lower Columbia Regional University Center located on the Lower Columbia College campus. Partner universities include: * City University of Seattle * Warner Pacific University * Washington State University Vancouver  Academics  Lower Columbia College offers a selection of degree and certificate programs designed to prepare students for advanced studies or to move directly into the workforce.  Activities and events  The Associated Students of Lower Columbia College (ASLCC), along with faculty and staff at the college, plan student and community events throughout the year. Students participate in events, activities, clubs and organizations both on and off campus. Activities and event dates are posted on the Events Calendar and the Student Activities web page.  Athletics  Lower Columbia College participates in the Northwest Athletic Conference (NWAC).

Prominent characters are listed here. The Foutleys =Ginger Foutley= ;Voiced by Melissa Disney Ginger Foutley is an average 12-year-old girl, ginger haired and the main protagonist in the series. She was not considered \\"popular\\" until Courtney Gripling, the stereotypical \\"school diva\\", decided to befriend her. Through Ginger, Courtney is able to view how the world works outside of the popular clique. However, Courtney's \\"right-hand woman\\", Miranda Killgallen, becomes increasingly jealous of Courtney and Ginger's relationship, and stops at nothing to relegate Ginger to her previous role of geek. Aside from Courtney, Ginger has a group of loyal friends (Dodie Bishop and Macie Lightfoot), who are nearly always ready to back her up. At home, Ginger's mother Lois, a nurse, attempts to give Ginger advice for the majority of her situations, but, as Ginger is often too embarrassed to listen to her mother's reasoning, she ends up learning from her own mistakes much of the time. Ginger's younger brother, fourth-grader Carl, often attempts to use Ginger as a test subject for his experiments and twisted schemes. However, he has tried this so much that Ginger can usually tell that he is up to something, and refuses to comply. Early on in the series, Ginger did not know much about her father, who left the family shortly after Carl was born. In Hello Stranger, she invited him to her poetry reading at school. Although he did not respond to the invitation, Ginger was convinced he would show anyway, and thus, was devastated when he didn't. In An \\"Even-Steven\\" Holiday Special (the title of which refers to Ginger being torn between how to celebrate Christmas and Chanukah at the same time after learning that she is one-quarter Jewish), Jonas returns to the family briefly after seeing Carl playing Santa Claus on the street. Though never having officially found his way back into the family, Jonas became more of an installation in the show, appearing at various intervals to give Ginger fatherly advice. An excellent student, Ginger is a very talented writer, particularly gifted at writing poetry. \\"Hello Stranger\\" shows that she also has a talent for spoken word. In The \\"A\\" Ticket, her crush, Ian Richton, was paired up with her as a lab partner, but used her to get an A so he could stay on the soccer team, much to Ginger's chagrin. Ginger is a favorite of her English teacher, Ms. Zorski, due to her impressive writing skills. Ginger once wrote a poem entitled \\"And Then She Was Gone\\" (in the episode And She Was Gone), to Ms. Zorski's concern, who subsequently sent Ginger to the school counselor. Her talent for writing is expounded on in the series finale, when we are shown that Ginger has become a successful author later in life. Ginger's love life was rather catastrophic throughout the course of the show. Initially, she harbored a crush on Ian Richton, which presumably ended when she discovered he was only using her to get an A in science. Another notable relationship that Ginger has had is with Sasha, a boy she met at summer camp. She left camp on good terms with Sasha, but when she visited him at his school in Ginger's Solo, he tells her he has a girlfriend. Her relationship with good friend and neighbor Darren Patterson was incredibly tumultuous and underwent much change during the series. In Dare I, Darren? Ginger began to look at Darren in a more romantic light following Miranda's suggestion that they (Ginger and Darren) would make a good couple. Later on, in the episode Never Can Say Goodbye, she develops a physical attraction to Darren after he gets his headgear removed. Despite attempts to deny these newfound feelings, Ginger becomes incredibly jealous when Darren and Miranda begin to date. Finally, in Foutley's on Ice (Part 3), Ginger and Darren become an official couple. However, when they reach high school, Darren soon takes interest in a cheerleader named Simone. Darren then cheats on Ginger, leaving her heartbroken. She then develops acute appendicitis and has to go to the hospital. She then finds comfort in a new friend, Orion. She and Orion never have an official relationship, but more of a flirtatious friendship. Though in the series finale, The Wedding Frame (Part 3), Ginger \\"takes the leap\\" and is shown with Orion at her mother's wedding. However, at the end of the episode, when Ginger's future is shown, she not only is wearing a wedding (or perhaps engagement ring), but is shown with Darren, who is holding a baby that looks rather like Ginger. =Carl Foutley= ;Voiced by Jeannie Elias Carl Foutley is Ginger's younger brother, who is 9 years old and in the fourth grade in the first season. He and his sidekick, \\"Hoodsey\\" Bishop, come up with their schemes and perform their experiments in an abandoned doghouse in the Foutleys' backyard. The doghouse once belonged to the Foutleys' dog Monster, who ran away many years prior to the beginning of the series. In the series finale, Monster returns to the Foutleys. Because of his unique, yet disturbing personality, his family sometimes act like they don't like him, and often criticize him. Courtney Gripling's younger brother, Blake, is often the recipient of Carl's bad humor, due to the repeated theft of a petrified eyeball that initially belonged to Carl. Blake can usually be seen trying to get on Carl's good side, but Carl refuses his advances and takes every opportunity to humiliate Blake. Carl's catch phrase is \\"classified.\\" He is incredibly secretive about his plans, revealing as little as possible about them to anyone who may inquire, even if he needs outside help acquiring the necessary materials to carry them out, of which include catching a naked mole-rat, turning himself into a wolf, and attempting to stay on a ski lift for 16 hours. Despite his love of the gross and unusual things, Carl's also got a big heart, as shown on several occasions; delivering a beautiful eulogy at Maude's funeral (\\"Carl & Maude\\"), and even openly crying after hearing about Mrs. Gordon's untimely passing hours after he'd tried to get her to return. In \\"Fast Reputation\\", it was revealed that Carl is a great cook. Joann Bishop (Dodie and Hoodsey's mother) does not like Carl and often speaks very ill of him, despite his usual attempts to be nice to her. Carl's one true love is Noelle Sussman. Originally, Noelle was viewed by Carl as a nobody on whom he could test his \\"disappearing powder\\", as he felt that she was expendable and would not be missed. As he studies the progress of his experiments, however, he realizes what a truly weird girl Noelle is, and that he misses her, leading the two to develop a relationship in And She Was Gone. The series finale shows Carl and Hoodsey becoming popular TV reporters. They are also among the group at a later reading of Ginger's latest book. =Lois Foutley= ;Voiced by Laraine Newman Lois \\"Lola\\" Foutley is Ginger and Carl's mother. She is supposedly 31 years old, but this is likely a lie, more likely; like Dodie and Courtney's moms, she is close to 40. Lois is also a Nurse. She seems to be fond of celery in the later episodes, and can often be seen munching away. Although she is a nurturing mother to Ginger and Carl, she is also something of a strict disciplinarian, and does not hesitate to put her foot down when she feels it is necessary; for example, in Kiss and Make-up, Ginger, Dodie, and Macie create their own make-up using crayons, pudding, and other household ingredients. Lois becomes furious at this blatant defiance, for she had already told Ginger that she was too young to wear makeup, and subsequently grounds Ginger \\"indefinitely\\" without hearing her reasoning. However, with Carl, Lois seems to have adopted a \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" philosophy. In episode 23, it is revealed that Lois has a strange fear of accountants (although mentioned in passing and never brushed up upon again). Within the same episode, you can hear her mutter to herself her wish of the demise of all pygmy elephants. Although it has been debatable among fans. Often, leaving many fans to review the episode over to try and catch it. She drives an old blue Volkswagen Beetle, which has an engine fire in the episode TGIF. In \\"TGIF\\" While Buzz was urging her that she has to immediately contact professional help to deal with the mold within in the Foutley House, there is camera shot of her big booty in dark blue jeans. In \\"Ms. Foutley's Boys\\" When Lois told Buzz to leave her and not come back, when Buzz spits out his meatballs in shock and uses his arm to wipe the sauce off of his mouth, there was a camera shot of Lois making an \\"seductive evil smile\\" for a few seconds while showing her breasts in her paintball jacket. Before the beginning of the series, Lois was married to Jonas Foutley, who left her shortly after Carl's birth. Lois' love life remained dormant until Ms. Foutley's Boys, when she and Buzz (the plumber who fixed the Foutleys' mold problem in TGIF), develop a flirtatious relationship, later leading to Buzz and his three sons moving into the Foutley house, and becoming an annoyance by giving everything \\"a man's touch\\". Buzz continually uses the excuse \\"boys will be boys\\" to justify his sons' conduct as well as his own, eventually leading Lois to break up with him. After accepting Dr. Dave's marriage proposal in \\"About Face\\", In Butterflies Are Free Part One, she decides to diet and exercise to get prepared for the wedding ahead of time, In Part Two, she has succeeded her goal, which had made a first impression on Ginger, who graduates middle school. A while after this, she then began seeing a coworker from the hospital, Dr. David Dave. He proposed to her in About Face and they were married in the series finale, The Wedding Frame. Lois and Dave are last seen many years later attending a reading of Ginger's latest book. It is worth noting that Lois kept Jonas' last name although they had presumably been divorced for somewhere around ten years (assuming Jonas left before Carl was a year old and considering Carl is in fourth grade, which would make him nine or ten years old) at the series' beginning. =Jonas Foutley= ;Voiced by Tom Virtue Jonas Foutley is Ginger and Carl's biological father, who abandoned them and Lois sometime after Carl was born. Ginger never had any fond or, for that matter, clear memories of her father, and all the photographs of him that are in her possession are of his feet. In Hello Stranger, Jonas is 34 years old, and he lives in an apartment. Although he never returns Ginger's call, she convinces herself that he will show up at her reading. Lois, however, rightly believes that he will not appear. Lois is at work at the time of Ginger's performance, and has sunflowers sent to the school with a card signed \\"Dad\\", but Ginger realizes that Lois sent the flowers and her father let her down. In An \\"Even Steven\\" Holiday Special, Jonas is shown performing as Santa Claus, standing on the street corner, collecting money, and happens to come across Carl and Hoodsey. Hoodsey believes that Jonas is really Santa Claus, and confides in him that Carl does not believe in Santa, because Santa has never granted him his only wish (to have his father home for Christmas). After hearing this, Jonas decides to pay the Foutleys a visit, which somewhat improved his relationship with his children. Though Jonas never really becomes a fixture in the family, he appears sometimes to bequeath fatherly advice to Ginger, and to teach her about the extended family from which she is descended. Carl, however, is still bitter towards his dad for abandoning him and limits his contact with him. Jonas is described as an \\"animal lover\\" and has a pet dog named Ben. =Dr. David Dave= ;Voiced by David Jeremiah (voice actor) Dr. David Dave is 39 years old. Although not an official Foutley, Dr. Dave and Lois were married in the series finale. He had worked very closely with Lois at the hospital since the beginning of the series. Over the course of the show, there were numerous hints of him having a crush on Lois. He proposed in About Face. His mother, 60 years old, does not approve of their relationship and in The Wedding Frame hired someone to sabotage it, but was stopped and the wedding went on as planned. He and Lois are last seen years later at a reading of his stepdaughter Ginger's latest book. The Bishops =Dodie Bishop= ;Voiced by Aspen Miller Deirdre Hortense \\"Dodie\\" Bishop, 12 years old, along with Macie Lightfoot, makes up Ginger's inner circle of friends. Dodie is known for her big mouth and her love of gossip; she is often seen updating Ginger on the latest happenings with the popular group or on modern romance. She appears to be very needy and wants nothing more than to be popular, often doing unscrupulous things in order to achieve a high social status. For example, in the episode Dodie's Big Break, she feigned a broken leg in order to win a much-coveted spot on the cheerleading squad, but her ruse was uncovered by Ginger and Macie. Usually, however, whenever she believes she is on the verge of becoming popular, she becomes somewhat corrupt and dishonest and always ends up back where she started. While it is difficult for her to realize when her ploys for popularity, acceptance and sometimes manipulation have gone too far, she will do all she can to apologize and repair the damage done as soon as she realizes what she's done. It is also noted that while she occasionally succumbs to the lure of being popular on her own, she usually wants her best friends included in her schemes: she is at core a loyal friend, and will usually stop herself short of harming Ginger and Macie. At the series' beginning, Courtney Gripling referred to her as \\"Potie\\" and hardly acknowledged her existence. However, as Courtney grows closer to Ginger, she ends up growing closer to Dodie, as well. In Of Lice & Friends, Dodie becomes the school announcer. Concerned with the dullness of the announcements, Dodie begins to intersperse school information with interesting tidbits of gossip. This turns the morning announcements into a much- anticipated event, and also makes her the talk of popular kids as she somehow knows things that even Miranda Killgallen admits not knowing. Pressured to keep her announcements interesting and running out of news, Dodie finds the list of kids who have lice, and decides to read it over the loudspeaker when she discovers Courtney's name on it. Ginger manages to stop her before she gets to Courtney's name, and while briefly angry at her friend, Dodie soon understands she's gotten carried away by the popularity and resigns. She is the daughter of Joann and David Charles Bishop; Joann appears to be the source of Dodie's ruthless and deceitful nature, as Robert explained to his daughter that, as a teenager, Joann was the very same as Dodie: desperate for popularity, but always falling short of it. She is however far less judgmental and controlling than her mother, perhaps thanks to influence from her mild, timid father and his sharper perception of the word. Dodie is very close to her best friends, and can react very strongly when she feels she might lose her place in their hearts to someone else. She has even been resentful of the otherwise idolized Courtney Gripling, becoming jealous when she invites Ginger to participate in social events such as birthday parties or sleepovers, or when she believes Ginger is closer to Courtney than she is to her, like when they are seen seemingly sharing secrets during a fire drill (though in this case, her fears are actively stoked by Miranda). This jealousy also reared its head when Darren and Ginger first became a couple and became somewhat absorbed in each other, leading her and Macie to attempt to split them up. When the plan was discovered and Ginger ceased to talk to them for a while, Dodie was consumed with guilt and can be heard leaving an apology in Ginger's answering machine. When she enters high school, Dodie attempts to become a cheerleader, but is relegated to the position of equipment manager. She matures, becoming slightly more careful in her approach to social situations and gossip: when she catches wind of her friend's boyfriend Darren being attracted to cheerleader Simone, she writes him a lengthy letter, telling him that she will not run to Ginger with the information but advising him to take care of the situation in the best way he can before someone gets hurt. At the end of the series finale, Dodie is shown marrying her boyfriend, Chet Zipper, with whom she has a baby daughter. =Robert Joseph 'Hoodsey' Bishop= ;Voiced by Tress MacNeille Hoodsey Joseph Bishop is Dodie's younger brother, 9 years old, and Carl Foutley's best friend and sidekick. He is extremely gullible and believes anything someone tells him. He usually never has supplementary ideas for Carl's plots, but is typically more than happy to help. He is called \\"Hoodsey\\" due to the fact that he never wears anything but a purple hooded sweatshirt, and his closet has many of them. Hoodsey is a complete mama's boy, and is always repeating things his mother tells him. He usually uses his mother's advice in an attempt to make Carl stop his scheming, typically to no avail. In the series finale, Hoodsey is shown, along with Carl, as a popular TV reporter, and they are both seen amongst the group at a reading of Ginger's latest book. He is also shown that he has a wedding ring on his finger. =Joann Bishop= ;Voiced by Susan Krebs Joann Bishop is Dodie and Hoodsey's mother and is a very irritable woman. She seems to be deeply critical and disapproving of Hoodsey's friendship with Carl Foutley, and also seems to just barely tolerate Lois Foutley as Lois does the same. Despite this, she has no problem with Dodie and Ginger's friendship as she considers Ginger to be a good influence on her daughter. Much to Dodie's horror, Joann lands a substitute teaching job at Dodie's school in the episode About Face. However this appears to be an attempt to reinvent her youth, as she does her best to get Courtney's group to accept her by pathetically adopting outdated and exaggerated teenage mannerisms, and giving herself the alias of \\"Josie.\\" Dodie initially assumes that Joann was the equivalent of Courtney during her teens, but later finds out that in middle school, Joann was pretty much like Dodie herself: needy, dishonest, and desperate to be popular. Joann's picture in her middle school yearbook reads, \\"Missed Popularity\\" whilst her classmate, the true Josie MacDonald, was voted \\"Miss Popularity.\\" According to her husband, Joann also turned to deceitful tactics to achieve popularity; a trait which she appears to have passed on to her daughter. Joann later showed remorse for her actions and encouraged her daughter to accept herself for who she was, lest she never find happiness. Joann is portrayed as very neurotic and something of a control freak. She insists on calling Dodie and Hoodsey by their real names, and hates being referred to as \\"JoJo\\". =Dave Bishop= ;Voiced by John Astin (season 1) and Dan Castellaneta (seasons 2-3) David Charles \\"Dave\\" Bishop is Dodie and Hoodsey's father. He almost always appears to be on the couch, though an important enough cause (such as a death in the family) will raise him. He is calmer than his wife and much more accepting of Carl as Hoodsey's friend. He is a loving and affectionate father, and worries a great deal about his children's happiness. In the episode About Face, he urged his children to accept themselves for who they are, for fear they end up as unhappy as their mother, who had spent her entire youth as an obnoxious social climber trying to get people to like her and ended up with nothing. He and Hoodsey watch The Weather Channel together and he is a fan of game shows. He has a definite resemblance to Hoodsey, almost looking like an older, fatter Hoodsey with glasses. The Lightfoots =Macie Lightfoot= ;Voiced by Jackie Harris Ginger's other best friend is Macie, 12 years old. Macie is in a constant state of panic, as she is allergic to everything and fears change. She is portrayed as the \\"geekiest\\" one of the group, and is very knowledgeable. She is incredibly childish, most likely due to her parents not being there to help her through the various stages of adolescence. It is implied that they were very attentive to her when she was younger. She also possesses quite an array of knowledge on a great variation of subjects. Macie is half Asian/half Caucasian; her mother being Asian and her father Caucasian. In Come Back Little Seal Girl, Macie, Dodie, and Ginger agree on doing a skit devoted to The Little Seal Girl, their childhood heroine, for their school talent show. They will do it together, as per their Best Friends Tradition. When Dodie and Ginger back out because Miranda and Courtney have ridiculed their skit as juvenile, Macie goes solo, stating that her friends are betraying her and the Seal Girl, whom they've lived by for their whole lives. Despite the skepticism of everyone and more than a few things going wrong during the skit (such as the tape recording she was performing to malfunctioning in the middle of her routine), Macie ends up winning the talent show. Dodie and Ginger congratulate her after the show, and the trio is reconciled. In Family Therapy, Macie is crushed by her parents forgetting her thirteenth birthday. Consumed with guilt, they buy her a swingset: they've been absent from Macie's life for so long, they're unaware of her real age and what is appropriate for her. They proceed to catch up with Macie in this fashion, taking her to parks, kiddie restaurants, and generally treating her like a six-year-old, to Ginger's horror and Macie's delight. This becomes a bone of contention between the two friends, with Ginger worrying that Macie might lose herself in the charade and Macie eager to bask in her parents' attention once more, leading Macie to openly reject her friend's well- intentioned meddling. Despite Ginger's fears, Macie is shown to have had a firm grip on reality all along, and after commenting that reliving her childhood has been great, assures her friends that she'll tell her parents she is thirteen. Macie already knew Dodie when they both met Ginger in second grade, and at the start of junior high, it seems that Macie would have been happy keeping things as they were, not being too eager to grow up. Her birthday is April 22. She is last seen in the series finale as part of the group that has turned out for Ginger's book reading. =Robert \\"Bobby\\" and Roberta \\"Bobbie\\" Lightfoot= ;Voiced by Michael McKean (Bobby) and Mary Gross (Bobbie) Macie's father is Bobby Lightfoot, Ph.D, and her mother is Bobbie Lightfoot, Ph.D. They are both psychologists and portray the stereotypical new age parents. However, they are also both incredibly absent-minded, forgetting Macie's thirteenth birthday and making up for it by treating her ten years younger than she actually was. Bobbie is Asian and Bobby is Caucasian. The Wedding Frame Part Three is the episode where they made their final appearance. The Pattersons =Darren Patterson= ;Voiced by Kenny Blank Ginger's long-time friend and next door neighbor Darren Patterson, 13 years old, is another member of Ginger's inner circle of friends. He is calm, reliable and down to earth. Although he is not truly a geek, Darren's unwieldy orthodontia was a serious strain on his popularity. His other main issue is that his brother Will and his father, both loud, tough and into sports, think he's way too soft. All this began to change, however, when he got his headgear off and instantly became attractive and popular. He briefly dated Miranda Killgallen and, at one time, thought Courtney was interested in him, both times putting Ginger in an awkward position. He declares his love for Ginger when she moves away in Far From Home, after which they became a couple. After their relationship suffers some trouble, Darren leaves Ginger for an older cheerleader named Simone (whom he was seeing behind her back). This hurts Ginger in such a way that she decides to cut him out of her life entirely. As of the series finale, Darren and Simone are still dating but when seeing Ginger and Orion together he looks visibly upset and uncomfortable. However, in a sneak peek into the future reveals that Ginger and Darren get married and have a child. =Will Patterson= ;Voiced by Guy Torry Darren's older brother, 16 years old, high school junior, licensed driver, and main tormentor Will Patterson has the opposite school status as his brother does. He is one of the most popular kids at the high school. He has a group of girls that follow him around school and is the football star on the field. He takes his role as older brother very seriously. In The Right Stuff, Macie is throwing a pool party for her advanced French class (of which Will is a student of). When Will sees Darren, he picks him up and throws him into the pool, even after Darren claims that he'll rust (referring to his headgear). Also, in Fast Reputation, Ginger, Dodie, and Macie crash a party that Will is chugging sodas at. In New Girl in Town, Ginger asks Will to come to a party she's throwing for the new girl, but he refuses until he finds out it's in a morgue. He occasionally offers Darren brotherly advice; in the series finale, The Wedding Frame, he gives Darren a little advice on how to handle his devastated relationship with Ginger, but he quickly turns the conversation to center around himself. =Mr. Patterson= ;Voiced by Billy Brown Darren and Will's father is known for his head noogies. In Hello Stranger, he gives Ginger a head noogie to congratulate her on her poem. He claims that his head noogies worked for him when he was trying to get a date with Mrs. Patterson in Foutley's On Ice. =Mrs. Patterson= ;Voiced by Ja'net Dubois Darren and Will's mother is only seen a few times in the whole series. In Never Can Say Goodbye, she shouted for joy when she saw her baby boy (Darren) without his headgear on. Also, in the episode ' 'Far From Home' ' we see her inquiring about how Darren's doing after he suffers a bout of depression when Ginger leaves to spend a semester in Avalanche Academy. In the series finale, she seemed ticked off with her two sons after she found out that she was supposed to receive an invitation to the Foutley's wedding, but never actually did. This means she was completely unaware of Darren's unfaithfulness to Ginger, however surprisingly Darren can be seen at the wedding. The Griplings =Courtney Gripling= ;Voiced by Liz Georges Courtney Claire Gripling, 12 years old and, is the most popular girl at Lucky Jr. High (although she have some difficulties to fit in high school). While not extremely book-smart, Courtney is not a typical ditzy blonde: she takes an advanced language class that Macie also attends and is very curious about the world around her, particularly the world outside the millionaire lifestyle her family maintains. She is also knowledgeable in fashion and in the complex code of conduct necessary to become and stay popular in middle school, though it is shown throughout the series that even Courtney can sometimes fail at this. She can be mean and shallow, judging people by their clothing (once even forgiving Ginger's avoidance of her because of a particularly well chosen outfit Ginger wore to school) and being insensitive to those who are less popular, but she can also be a caring and attentive friend. Courtney is very naive because of her sheltered upbringing, being puzzled as to how a vacuum cleaner works, what happens at regular summer camps, and sometimes even as to how genuine care and acceptance are like. This leads her to attach quickly to those who demonstrate an honest affection towards her. Courtney took a liking to Ginger early on in the series, wanting to see how Ginger would survive if put in an all-popular kids setting. To her surprise, Ginger could manage, and the two became real friends, and it is towards Ginger that Courtney's sincere affections are often directed. She notably drove to Ginger's home to thank her for stopping her lice infection from becoming public knowledge, travelled to Avalanche Arts to convince her to return, and alerted Ginger to a plan to separate her from boyfriend Darren, even though a few of her own close friends were part of the scheme. However, even Ginger receives the occasional \\"Courtney-ism\\", considering that Courtney has a whole group of friends to manage. Closest of those friends to Courtney is her right-hand woman, Miranda, who strongly dislikes Ginger. Courtney's group seems to approve of her leader status. In No Hope for Courtney, a girl named Hope takes on Courtney's position, leaving Courtney in a social slump. In the end, Courtney reclaims her position as leader and Hope becomes one of her many followers. In Mommie Nearest, Courtney's mother has to stay in the hospital after she gets an infection from a face lift. Courtney then spends more time with Ginger's mother, Lois, as a temporary replacement. It results in Courtney staying a few nights in Ginger's home. Ginger quickly becomes jealous of the natural mother-daughter relationship Courtney and Lois have. In Fair to Cloudy, Ginger invited Darren to the county fair without consulting her normal companions, Dodie and Macie. Dodie then retaliates by inviting Courtney. At the fair, Courtney, as Ginger put it, \\"has to try everything\\", as she is intrigued that such a lifestyle exists. Courtney's main love interest throughout the show is Darren's older brother, Will, though the latter is usually either oblivious or uninterested. Courtney's reasons for attending a public school are left unexplained. Her younger brother, Blake, also attends a public school. It could possibly be that, similar to the character Veronica Lodge from the Archie comics, that their father enrolled them in public schools to avoid them being spoiled - without any success. Courtney sometimes refers to Macie as \\"Stacey\\" or \\"Kacey\\" and Dodie as \\"Potie.\\" The girls in Courtney's inner circle (not all at once) have included Ginger, Miranda, Mipsy, Missy, Mindy, Traci, Stacey, Kacie, Donna, Diva, Dinah, Heather, Lonnie, and Hope. These members change: they have been added and dropped over the course of the series (with the exceptions of Miranda, Mipsy and Ginger). =Blake Gripling= ;Voiced by Tara Strong (pilot); Kath Soucie (series) Blake Sofia Gripling is Courtney's younger brother. He's the youngest of the main cast at 7 years old, and is Carl and Hoodsey's classmate, having moved up a couple grades because of his intellect. He is spoiled, devious, while being a gentleman; and despite always being at odds with Carl, deep down he wants to be his best friend. But as Carl turns him down time after time (while trying to humiliate him in the process), Blake tries to best the youngest Foutley whenever he can. Blake has a dislike for Hoodsey (whom he sometimes refer to as 'Woodsey') and doesn't get along too well with his sister Courtney. Winston, the butler of the Griplings, is something of a father figure to Blake and often involved in his schemes. He was named Blake as part of a family tradition so that his initials, \\"B.G.\\", would be in accordance with the initials on his baby blanket, a family heirloom. =Claire Gripling= ;Voiced by Candi Milo Claire Gripling is Courtney and Blake's mother who believes in spoiling her children. It has been revealed that she and Courtney take a trip to Paris each spring to see the new fashions. Still, Claire has a lot to learn about being a good person. In Trouble in Gal Pal Land, Claire agrees to have Hoodsey pose as a street urchin whom she took in so she could win the election to be a board member of the country club. In Mommie Nearest, Claire goes to the hospital after a bad face lift. =Prescott Gripling= ;Voiced by Sam McMurray As Ginger learns in TGIF, Prescott Gripling, Courtney and Blake's father, never missed dinner as it doesn't start unless he is on loudspeaker on the telephone as they eat. In The Wedding Frame, he was discovered as to have been arrested for insider trading. In order to pay for all of the felonies and other penalties against him, he is stripped of all of his family fortune. =Winston= ;Voiced by John Kassir Faithful butler to the Griplings and sidekick to Blake, Winston is more of a fatherly figure to Courtney and Blake than Prescott ever was. He has never married and has no children and sees the Griplings as his surrogate family rather than just his employers. He is often involved in Blake's latest schemes to ruin/befriend Carl Foutley. The Killgallens =Miranda Killgallen= ;Voiced by Cree Summer Miranda Killgallen is Courtney's right- hand woman and possibly the wickedest girl in school, serving as Ginger's main antagonist on the show. Apart from having totally different personalities, Miranda's dislike for Ginger mainly stems from her fear that \\"Foutley\\" may replace her as Courtney's best friend. On top of that, both Miranda and Ginger have a romantic interest in Ian Richton. Miranda has thwarted Ginger by all means possible, including manipulation (Dare I, Darren), blackmail (Cry Wolf), false accusations (I Spy a Witch, Ginger the Juvey), backstabbing (Wicked Game), and bribery (Far From Home). She has failed every attempt to make Ginger look bad, even raising her popularity a few times. At times, however, even \\"tough girl\\" Miranda is shown to have her weak sides. On more than one occasion, it's illustrated that she has a difficult relationship with her strict parents and that she has very few actual friends. When Ginger finds out about this, she feels sorry for her. In Trouble in Gal-Pal Land, Miranda is left friendless when she and Courtney have a temporary falling-out; Macie states that it's because nobody likes her. Miranda is also shown to not be a true friend of Courtney's, as when Courtney briefly lost her popularity to Hope Rogers, Miranda wasted no time in abandoning Courtney to join Hope's clique. Apart from her viciousness, Miranda's trademark are her sniping, sarcastic comments. Miranda is partially of African-American heritage, but in the original version of the pilot, Miranda was going to be an all white girl with brunette hair. =Officer Killgallen= ;Voiced by Richard McGonagle Miranda's father is a police officer. Miranda used this to her advantage when, in Ginger the Juvey, she convinced Ginger to steal a sign outside of a bank to give as a gift to Courtney, and then called her father to report the robbery. In Summer of Camp Caprice, he runs a military camp where Miranda and Darren are students. =Miranda's mother= It is not clear if Miranda's mother is still alive or currently (if ever) married to her father, as she has never been shown or even mentioned. When Macie asks Miranda if she had ever said anything nice to her mom and dad (in Trouble in Gal Pal Land), Miranda doesn't act surprised by the question. Also, Miranda refers to 'her parents' in Ginger's Solo, so it can be assumed Miranda's mother is alive and well. The Higsbys =Brandon Higsby and Mr. Licorice= ;Voiced by Grey DeLisle (Brandon) and Dee Bradley Baker (Mr. Licorice) Brandon Higsby is an annoying classmate of Carl. He is extremely hyper, perpetually chipper, and considers Carl and Hoodsey his closest friends. In actuality, he has no friends, but his parents think he's popular. His only true friend seems to be Mr. Licorice, his pet monkey, a hand-me-down from his older brother, Stuart. However, Mr. Licorice doesn't seem to like Brandon all that much. =Stuart Higsby= ;Voiced by Chris Marquette Stuart Higsby is the savior to all forgetful and lazy kids at Lucky Jr. High. He runs a business in the boys' bathroom where people can purchase pre-written book reports from him at a reasonable price. At one point, Darren became a customer of his when Ginger was blackmailed into writing Miranda's report on The Call of the Wild in Cry Wolf. He owns a monkey, named Mr. Licorice, whom he eventually gives to his little brother, Brandon. =Mr. and Mrs. Higsby= ;Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker (Mr. Higsby) and Sally Struthers (Mrs. Higsby) Mr. and Mrs. Higsby are Brandon and Stuart's parents. While Mrs. Higsby is in charge of making sure shoes are taken off, feet are off the furniture, and little boys don't become hyperactive, Mr. Higsby is in charge of recording everything with his trusty video camera. Teachers and school staff =Principal Milty= ;Voiced by Jerry Houser Principal Milty is the former principal of Lucky Elementary and is now the principal of Lucky Jr. High. He, like most of their teachers, does not like Carl and Hoodsey. He has a dog, named The Dutchess, that Carl and Hoodsey became good friends with when they trained her in The Nurses' Strike. =Ms. Zorski= ;Voiced by Elizabeth Halpern Ms. Zorski is Ginger's English teacher. She is a constant inspiration and supporter of Ginger's natural writing talent. In And She Was Gone, Ms. Zorski let Ginger know that she loved the poem she had written before she added that it concerned her. She has a cousin, also named Ms. Zorski (voiced by Shawana Kemp), who teaches at the high school. Ginger learns that the two have completely different teaching styles. Even after Ginger graduated Jr. High she stays in touch with Ms. Zorski. * Emily Kapnek, the creator, based the character of Ms. Zorski off of one of her own teachers. =Mrs. Gordon= ;Voiced by Kathleen Freeman Carl's teacher, Elaine Gordon, was not the most patient woman. She never had any tolerance for Carl's behavior and often found herself sending him out into the hall. She was also the victim of some of Carl's pranks. One was so bad that it drove her to retirement in No Hope for Courtney. Although she promised Carl that she would come back, she passed on shortly after. Carl actually cried at the end of the episode indicating that Mrs. Gordon was everyone's favorite teacher. In \\"And She Was Gone\\" however, it appears that Ms. Gordon has come back to life for a short period of time (or that episode was set before No Hope for Courtney). * The episode No Hope for Courtney was dedicated to Kathleen Freeman, who died of lung cancer on August 23, 2001 at the age of 82. =Mr. Hepper= ;Voiced by Andre Ware Mr. Hepper is the music teacher of Carl and Hoodsey. Because of his teaching subject and laid back style, he's a favorite of the two boys, and in turn is the only teacher who likes them. After Mrs. Gordon died, Hepper also took over her classes. After school, he plays in a jazz trio. =Mr. Celia= ;Voiced by Lewis Arquette The science teacher at Lucky Jr High, Mr. Celia teaches chemistry and biology. He is Ginger's second favourite teacher after Ms. Zorski. With Ginger one of the few students to attain his high standards, she's also a favorite of him. Celia has an ongoing struggle with the school board over funding. * Arquette died of heart failure on February 10, 2001 at age 65. The episode Piece of My Heart was dedicated to him. Classmates =Ian Richton= ;Voiced by Adam Wylie Ian Richton is the school's soccer star and major heartthrob; however, he is dimwitted. He is the perfect man in the eyes of both Ginger and Miranda. In The A Ticket, he is assigned to work with Ginger during chemistry classes, but lets her do all the work. Ginger mistakes his enthusiasm for something else and it takes a wake-up call from Darren for her to realize she's being used, but at the end, Ian realizes his mistakes, and lets Ginger keep his jacket. It has also been revealed that Ian has been raised by his single father. After voice actor Adam Wylie quit the cast at the end of season 1 and Ginger got over Ian in Summer Of Camp Caprice, he had no more speaking roles. Nevertheless, Ian can often be seen on school grounds and even moves on with Ginger to high school. =Mipsy Mipson= ;Voiced by Sandy Fox Most likely the third most popular girl at Lucky Jr. High is Melissa \\"Mipsy\\" Mipson. She appears to be closest to Miranda and shares her hate for Ginger. She helps Miranda play a prank on Ginger in Sleep on It to make Ginger wet her sleeping bag. In Foutley's on Ice, she pays off her uncle to accept Ginger as a new student for a writing academy and convinced her cousin, also a Mipson, to take on a new persona (Thea whose real name is Mitzy) and convince Ginger to stay full-time. When Ginger returns to Lucky Jr. High in Wicked Game, Mipsy and Miranda trick Dodie and Macie into helping them get Darren and Ginger to break up. Not much else is known about Mipsy. It has been suggested that she comes from a wealthy Jewish family and that if Ginger got too close to Courtney, Mipsy would be the most likely to be bumped down on the popularity chart. =Chet Zipper= ;Voiced by Hope Levy Chet Zipper, 14 years old, is a commoner among the students at Lucky Jr. High. Although Courtney knows who he is, his status as school announcer doesn't earn him much popularity status. He speaks in a dull monotone voice and puts words like \\"uh\\", \\"like\\", and \\"um\\" in between each word. He has been a suggested love interest for Dodie. In Piece of My Heart, they are seen dancing together at the school dance. In the series finale, Chet and Dodie are shown as a married couple with a daughter of their own. =Linda= ;Voiced by Olivia Hack and Hope Levy Linda is the school's hall monitor. As shown in Ginger the Juvey, she is on a first name basis with Courtney, who is the only student that she would probably let roam the halls without a hall pass. =Jean-Pierre= ;Voiced by Laraine Newman Foreign exchange student Jean-Pierre could get any girl at Lucky Jr. High. In Stealing First, Courtney bets that she can get him to kiss Ginger on the chair lift on the school ski trip, to which Miranda says is impossible. In No Hope for Courtney, he takes interest in a newly made-over Hope. But in \\"TGIF\\", he and Hope are shown in a loving embrace. =Laetitia Bowers= ;Voiced by Cara DeLizia Laetitia Bowers made her first appearance in New Girl in Town. She had a somewhat gothic appeal and she carried around a fake skull. Her father is a mortician. Rumors started floating around that the reason they moved to Sheltered Shrubs was because Mr. Bowers accidentally embalmed someone who wasn't dead yet. Ginger, Dodie, and Macie try to help her find her place at school, but it turns out it's with them. In later episodes, she can be seen in the background. Others =Dr. Fondfeelings= ;Voiced by Diane Michelle She was mentioned in Dare I,Darren? She made her first appearance in \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" When Ginger ignored Darren who stopped noticing her. In \\"Ms. Foutley's Boys\\" She had a tv segment talking to women who are alone and miserable. In \\"The Wedding Frame\\" She attended Lois and Dave's Wedding\\" In \\"Ms. Foutley's Boys\\" She Has Breasts. =Coach Candace= ;Voiced by Nora Dunn She made her first appearance in Butterflies Are Free Part One, When Dodie was at pep squad tryouts, she was explaining to the girls what cheerleading moves they have to if they want to make the cut but she warns Dodie that no female freshman has never made the cut, causing Dodie to be more determined. In Kiss Today Goodbye, she disliked her low carb healthy meal which had no taste, Dodie tells her she'll cook her meals for her, as a result, she is very impressed and Dodie started to work her way into helping her which included cleaning the cheerleaders hoodies, she earned presenting the pep squad in the football game. In Dodie's Big Break, she welcomed her into the pep squad as a mascot which she performed as in her first game in which she was injured and amazingly became a member of the pep squad but after finding out that Dodie continued to fake her injury that she recovered from, she kicked her off the squad, When Ginger ask her to forgive Dodie and allow her back in, she revealed her backstory about how she tried out as teen but never made it, After Ginger confronted her, she decided to let her back into the squad, but when Dodie hurt her leg, she decided to allow her to try out next year. Despite appearing in only three episodes as a story arc focusing on Dodie's aspired pep squad career, She is the first sexy minor character who appeared on the show. in all of her three appearances she wears a dark blue shirt and dark blue shoes. in her first appearance her, her bottom outfit was a dark blue skirt, then in her second and third appearances, her other bottom outfit is a pair of dark blue jean shorts. In Butterflies Are Free Part One, she wore her hair in a bun. In Kiss Today Goodbye And Dodie's Big Break, she lets hair down. She wears a whistle around her neck as a accessory. =Orion= ;Voiced by Justin Cowden * After Ginger's emotional heartbreak with Darren, Ginger found comfort in Orion. The two share a boyfriend- girlfriend-like relationship, but Ginger says that she doesn't want a boyfriend. He is the drummer of the band that Ginger is a part of. In The Wedding Frame, the two have a rough time getting past Ginger's new curiosity about Darren, but Ginger quickly gets over it. =Simone= ;Voiced by Erica Luttrell When Darren felt that his relationship with Ginger wasn't fresh, he cheated on her with cheerleader Simone. Darren and Ginger break up and Simone and Darren stay together. In The Wedding Frame, Darren seems to be caught up in Ginger. Simone turns to Miranda for advice, since Miranda is an expert on both Ginger and Darren. Miranda inspires her to go get her man. =Sasha= ;Voiced by J. Evan Bonifant Ginger met Sasha at Camp Caprice. The two developed crushes on each other, but when Sasha heard Courtney talking about Ginger and Ian, he becomes jealous and feels betrayed. However, when Ginger leaves camp, she and Sasha are on good terms. In Ginger's Solo, the school band is going to Sasha's school in Heathered Hills to perform. Ginger uses this opportunity to see Sasha again, but is crushed when she finds out that he's gotten back together with his former girlfriend. Then, the next summer, in Heat Lightning, Ginger returns to camp. She imagines she sees Sasha and feels bad that she's obsessing over him and not thinking about her boyfriend, Darren. When he sends a message to Ginger asking her to meet him on the beach, she does. But it turns out he \\"just wanted to say 'hey'\\", not get a date. Ginger realizes that she doesn't want Sasha for a boyfriend, what she wanted were the feelings she had when she first met him. =Hope Rogers= ;Voiced by Jane Wiedlin Hope Rogers is a classmate of Ginger's. She initially appeared as a background character on the show. In the episode \\"No Hope for Courtney\\", Ginger, Dodie and Macie found her crying in the girls' bathroom after Courtney called her \\"Faith\\" as she and her close group snubbed her. They decided to help her come out of her shell, giving her a list of tips. However, this resulted in them accidentally creating a monster, as Hope became more or less another version of Courtney. Overnight, Hope's popularity bloomed and she became a hit with the cool girls. Courtney was expelled from the clique and Hope usurped her position as the most popular girl in school. After several failed attempts to rid herself of Hope, and a heated fight, it comes to light that Hope used Courtney as a model for her new look, flattering Courtney. She joins Courtney's inner circle. =The Popular Girls= The Popular Girls, or \\"The A List\\" as Dodie once called them, are a clique of classmates that act as Courtney's entourage. Though the members are not always seen together, they are officially Missy, Mindy, Traci, Stacey, Casey, Donna, Diva, Dinah, Heather, Lonnie, and Hope. Aside from Miranda, Mipsy, and Hope, the girls in the clique rarely have any part in the show's plot, and seldom have any dialogue. Despite having Courtney as their leader, they are shown not to be actual friends, as they turned on Courtney when her social status slipped. In the episode No Hope for Courtney, they threw Courtney from their group without a thought after Hope Rogers became more popular. However they appear to be on friendly terms with Ginger, but apparently cannot tolerate Dodie or Macie. In the episode About Face, Dodie's attitude toward the popular girls changed after they made hurtful remarks about her mother, and she realized just how superficial they were. When Dodie enters high school, she focuses on trying to make the pep squad. =Noelle Sussman= ;Voiced by Emily Kapnek * Always a member of Carl's class, Noelle Sussman has telekinetic powers (she can move things with her mind). In And She Was Gone, Carl thought that no one would miss her if he used her to test his disappearing powder on. It turns out he missed her. Luckily, she only transferred to an elementary school across town. In Wicked Game, she lost Carl in a bet to Polly Shuster, a girl obsessed with birds. For an entire weekend, Carl would have to dress up like a bird and play Parrot World with her. Blake took pictures of Carl actually enjoying this game with Polly and showed them to Noelle in About Face. The two don't speak until The Wedding Frame. Noelle also kissed Hoodsey in the episode Foutley's on Ice; they tried making Hoodsey more manly in order for him to pose as an adult for a competition that they were going to join. This caused great jealousy on Carl's part after he witnessed the kiss, not knowing that it was purely experimental. She's originally from Portugal. =Chantel and Andrea= ;Voiced by Kimberly Brooks and Jamie Maria Cronin * When Macie and Courtney entered a high school-level French class, Macie was volunteered to throw a pool party. Two girls in that class, Chantel and Andrea, want to make a fool of their new classmate, Courtney. Luckily, Macie finds out about their plan to de-bikini Courtney and she, Ginger, Dodie, and Darren are able to stop them. =Maude= ;Voiced by Carol Kane * In the episode \\"Carl and Maude\\", when Ginger, Dodie, and Macie are forced to do community service at a retirement home, they take Carl along and he falls in love with an elderly prankster named Maude. Maude and Carl pull many pranks together and Carl decides to invite her to dinner and propose; however, Maude dies during dinner. Maude reappears as a spirit in I Spy a Witch.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Homo sapiens and other hominid species originated in Africa (see hominid dispersal) and that one of the routes taken to colonize Eurasia was through the Sinai Peninsula desert and the Levant, which means that this is one of the most important and most occupied locations in the history of the Earth. Not only have many cultures and traditions of humans lived here, but also many species of the genus Homo. In addition, this region is one of the centers for the development of agriculture. Impact of location, climate, routes Geographically the area is divided between a coastal plain, hill country to the east and the Jordan Valley joining the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. Rainfall decreases from the north to the south, with the result that the northern region of Israel has generally been more economically developed than the southern one of Judah. At the latest from the Neolithic period onwards, the area's location at the center of three trade routes linking three continents made it the meeting place for religious and cultural influences from Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor: # A Coastal Route (the \\"Via Maris\\"): connecting Gaza and the Philistine coast north to Joppa and Megiddo, travelling north through Byblos to Phoenicia and Anatolia. # A Hill Route: travelling through the Negev, Kadesh Barnea, to Hebron and Jerusalem, and thence north to Samaria, Shechem, Shiloh, Beth Shean and Hazor, and thence to Kadesh and Damascus. # The \\"Kings Highway\\": travelling north from Eilat, east of the Jordan through Amman to Damascus, and connected to the \\"frankincense road\\" north from Yemen and South Arabia. The area seems to have suffered from acute periods of desiccation, and reduced rainfall which has influenced the relative importance of settled versus nomadic ways of living. The cycle seems to have been repeated a number of times during which a reduced rainfall increases periods of fallow, with farmers spending increasing amounts of time with their flocks and away from cultivation. Eventually they revert to fully nomadic cultures, which, when rainfall increases settle around important sources of water and begin to spend increasing amounts of time on cultivation. The increased prosperity leads to a revival of inter-regional and eventually international trade. The growth of villages rapidly proceeds to increased prosperity of market towns and city states, which attract the attention of neighbouring great powers, who may invade to capture control of regional trade networks and possibilities for tribute and taxation. Warfare leads to opening the region to pandemics, with resultant depopulation, overuse of fragile soils and a reversion to nomadic pastoralism. Palaeolithic period (1,400,000 - 20,000 BCE) The display inside the camel cave at the Nahal Me'arot Nature Reserve depicts the life of prehistoric people in the Levant. (the Acheulo- Yabrudian culture) The earliest traces of the human occupation in the Levant are documented in Ubeidiya in the Jordan Valley of the Southern Levant, dated to the Lower Palaeolithic period, . The lithic assemblages relate to the Early Acheulian culture. Later Acheulian sites include Gesher Benot Ya'akov, Tabun Cave and others dated to the time span of . This layer contains the world's first signs of domesticated dogs and controlled usage of fire.James Serpell, The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour, and interactions with people, pp 10-12. Cambridge University Press, 1995, see also [Haaretz http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/tourist-tip-of-the-day/tourist- tip-237-the-prehistoric-man-museum-at-ma-ayan-baruch.premium-1.524213] Lower Palaeolithic human remains from the Southern Levant are scarce; they include isolated teeth from 'Ubeidiya, long bone fragments from Gesher Benot Ya'akov, and a fragmentary skull from Zuttiyeh Cave (\\"The Galilee Man\\"). The Middle Palaeolithic period () is represented in the Levant by the Mousterian culture, known from numerous sites (both caves and open-air sites) through the region. The chronological subdivision of the Mousterian is based on the stratigraphic sequence of the Tabun Cave. Middle Paleolithic human remains include both the Neanderthals (in Kebara Cave, Amud Cave and Tabun), and anatomically modern humans (AMH) from Jebel Qafzeh and Skhul Cave. The Upper Palaeolithic period is dated in the Levant to .  Epi-Palaeolithic period (20,000 - 9,500 BCE)  Epi-Palaeolithic period () is characterized by significant cultural variability and wide spread of the microlithic technologies. Beginning with the appearance of the Kebaran culture (18,000‚Äì12,500 BCE) a microlithic toolkit was associated with the appearance of the bow and arrow into the area. Kebaran shows affinities with the earlier Helwan phase in the Egyptian Fayyum, and may be associated with a movement of people across the Sinai associated with the climatic warming after the Late Glacial Maxima of 20,000 BCE. Kebaran affiliated cultures spread as far as Southern Turkey. The latest part of the period () is the time of flourishing of the Natufian culture and development of sedentism among the hunter-gatherers. = Natufian= This Culture existed from about 13,000 to 9,800 BCE in the Levant. A lot of archaeological excavations of this culture creates a relatively well defined understanding of these people. Two of the most significant aspects of this Culture were their large community sizes and their sedentary lifestyles. Although the Late Natufian experienced a slight reversal in this trend (possibly a result of the cold climatic period the Younger Dryas) as their community size shrank and they became more nomadic, it is believed that this culture continued through and was the foundation for the Neolithic Revolution. Neolithic period =Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic= A flint arrow from the Neolithic period that was created by the Yarmukian culture that was discovered in the Sha'ar HaGolan area The Neolithic period is traditionally divided to the Pre- Pottery (A and B) and Pottery phases. PPNA developed from the earlier Natufian cultures of the area. This is the time of the agricultural transition and development of farming economies in the Near East, and the region's first known megaliths (and Earth's oldest known megalith, other than Gobekli Tepe, which is in the Northern Levant and from an unknown culture) with a burial chamber and tracking of the sun or other stars. In addition, the Levant in the Neolithic (and later, in the Chalcolithic) was involved in large scale, far reaching trade. =Chalcolithic period= Trade on an impressive scale and covering large distances continued during the Chalcolithic (c. 4500‚Äì3300 BCE). Obsidian found in the Chalcolithic levels at Gilat, Israel have had their origins traced via elemental analysis to three sources in Southern Anatolia: Hotamis Daƒü, G√∂ll√º Daƒü, and as far east as Nemrut Daƒü, east of the other two sources. This is indicative of a very large trade circle reaching as far as the Northern Fertile Crescent at these three Anatolian sites. The Ghassulian period created the basis of the Mediterranean economy which has characterized the area ever since. A Chalcolithic culture, the Ghassulian economy was a mixed agricultural system consisting of extensive cultivation of grains (wheat and barley), intensive horticulture of vegetable crops, commercial production of vines and olives, and a combination of transhumance and nomadic pastoralism. The Ghassulian culture, according to Juris Zarins, developed out of the earlier Munhata phase of what he calls the \\"circum Arabian nomadic pastoral complex\\", probably associated with the first appearance of Semites in this area. Early and Middle Bronze Age Anthropoid coffins that were discovered in Deir el-Balah from the Late Bronze Age. The items are part of the permanent display at the Israel Museum The urban development of Canaan lagged considerably behind that of Egypt and Mesopotamia and even that of Syria, where from 3,500 BCE a sizable city developed at Hamoukar. This city, which was conquered, probably by people coming from the Southern Iraqi city of Uruk, saw the first connections between Syria and Southern Iraq that someBright, John (2000)\\"A History of Israel\\" (John Knox Press Westminster)Albright, William F. \\"From Abraham to Ezra\\" have suggested lie behind the patriarchal traditions. Urban development again began culminating in the Early Bronze Age development of sites like Ebla, which by 2,300 BCE was incorporated once again into an Empire of Sargon, and then Naram-Sin of Akkad (Biblical Accad). The archives of Ebla show reference to a number of Biblical sites, including Hazor, Jerusalem, and a number of people have claimed, also to Sodom and Gomorrah, mentioned in the patriarchal records. The collapse of the Akkadian Empire, saw the arrival of peoples using Khirbet Kerak Ware pottery, coming originally from the Zagros Mountains, east of the Tigris. It is suspected by some that this event marks the arrival in Syria and Palestine of the Hurrians, people later known in the Biblical tradition possibly as Horites. The following Middle Bronze Age period was initiated by the arrival of \\"Amorites\\" from Syria in Southern Iraq, an event which people like Albright (above) associated with the arrival of Abraham's family in Ur. This period saw the pinnacle of urban development in the area of Syria and Palestine. Archaeologists show that the chief state at this time was the city of Hazor, which may have been the capital of the region of Israel. This is also the period in which Semites began to appear in larger numbers in the Nile delta region of Egypt.

As of the 2019-20 school year, there were 95,647 students attending 119 schools in the district, which had an operating budget of $1.327 billion. The District school choice system is an open-enrollment system for school assignments and goes through the Student Assignment Office. A lottery process is used to assign students to schools when the number of applicants for a school exceeds the number of available seats. Students‚Äô applications are assigned random numbers to determine the order in which their applications will be considered in the assignment process. Integration While Brown v. Board of Education outlawed segregated public schools in 1954, Lee County opted to ignore the ruling. In 1964, a student named Rosalind Blalock attempted to enroll in Fort Myers High School, but was denied admission to the whites-only school. A court case filed on her behalf by the NAACP resulted in a court order that forced Lee County to begin integrating the public schools. Prior to that time, Lee maintained a system that was separate but not equal for minority students. The district proceeded, first by integrating the teachers, then the elementary schools, and finally the high schools. In 1969, traditionally black Dunbar High School was closed, and students were reassigned to various white high schools around the county. The situation was often tense, with a riot breaking out at Fort Myers High School, and administrators at North Fort Myers High School pretended not to recognize a black coach, causing police officers to send attack dogs after him. The court order stayed in place for 35 years, and many of its measures are still in place today.

Article VII, Section 2 of the 1971 Constitution of North Carolina gives the authority and qualifications for a sheriff in each county: * \\"In each county a Sheriff shall be elected by the qualified voters thereof at the same time and places as members of the General Assembly are elected and shall hold his office for a period of four years, subject to removal for cause as provided by law. No person is eligible to serve as Sheriff if that person has been convicted of a felony against this State, the United States, or another state, whether or not that person has been restored to the rights of citizenship in the manner prescribed by law. Convicted of a felony includes the entry of a plea of guilty; a verdict or finding of guilt by a jury, judge, magistrate, or other adjudicating body, tribunal, or official, either civilian or military; or a plea of no contest, nolo contendere, or the equivalent.

While he was Bishop of Mauritius, the island experienced one of its worst cyclones; in consequence his cathedral had to be used temporarily as a hospital.Dundee Evening Telegraph, Monday 28 October 1918 p3: \\"Death of Doctor William Walsh\\" Background Walsh's great-great-grandfather was Reverend Philip Walsh (1655‚Äì1740) who was the Prebendary of Tipperkevin, Vicar of Blessington, Rector of Ballymore Eustace, and chaplain to Primate Michael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh. His mother was Augusta Junietta Thwaites (1797-1873) and his father was Irish born Lieutenant William Walsh (1798-1839) of the 7th Royal Fusiliers. Walsh was born in 1836. In 1865 he married Catherine Banchory Pickering (1840-1915), daughter of Agnes Norris and General W. H. Pickering. Catherine and William Walsh had two children: William Trevor Hayne Walsh who was an educationist, and Leslie Herbert Walsh who became a surgeon. Career He was educated at St Alban's Hall, Oxford (united with Merton College, Oxford in 1881) where he graduated B.A. in 1859 and M.A. in 1862. He was ordained deacon in 1860 and priest in 1861. In 1891 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity at Oxford. Walsh began his ecclesiastical career with a curacy at Horsell from 1860 to 1863 and was curate of Upper Chelsea from 1863 to 1865. For a period from 1865 to 1870 he was Secretary of the Church Mission Society for Kent, Surrey and Sussex. This was followed by a three-year period as Superintendent of Missionaries and Clerical Secretary of the London Diocesan Home Mission, a role that he undertook again from 1886 to 1890. He was perpetual curate of St. Andrew's Watford from 1873 until 1878 and chaplain in Rome from 1878 to 1879. Walsh became Vicar of St Matthew Newington from 1879 to 1886.Crockford's Clerical Directory (1886), Oxford =Mauritius= Spire of St James Cathedral visible above wreckage of 1892 cyclone He became mission chaplain to the Bishop of London (Dr. Frederick Temple) from 1898‚Äì1891. Temple also made him a Prebendary of Wedland in St Paul's Cathedral from 1889‚Äì1891. He was consecrated Lord Bishop of Mauritius in Westminster Abbey on 2 February 1891. Just over a year later, one of the worst cyclones ever to hit Mauritius occurred on 29 April 1892 and devastated Port Louis. The Anglican Cathedral of St James was one of the few buildings that remained standing and was used as a hospital.[Ed. Allister Macmillan, Mauritius Illustrated, Historical and Descriptive Commercial and Industrial Facts, figures & Resources (2000), Asian Educational Services, Madras, p.64 =Dover= Walsh returned to England from Mauritius in 1897 to take up his appointment as Canon and Archdeacon of Canterbury and Assistant Bishop to Dr. Frederick Temple, who had become Archbishop of Canterbury in the previous year. In 1898 Walsh became Suffragan Bishop of Dover and in 1901 he was appointed chaplain to the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Walsh published the Progress of the Church in London During the last 50 Years (1887); this was updated in 1908 and re-titled Progress of the Church in London; from the Accession of Queen Victoria to 1908. In 1910 his ecclesiastical jubilee was celebrated in the Library of Canterbury Cathedral where Archbishop Randall Davidson praised him for his 50 years of unremitting public work. He was presented with a triptych watercolour picture of the Cathedral by the artist, Alexander Wallace Rimington. Walsh was himself an amateur artist and Vice-President of the East Kent Art Society. In 1913 he officiated and led prayers at the opening ceremony of The King's Hall, Herne Bay, Kent.Herne Bay Press 12 July 1913: \\"Royal visit\\" On 23 April 1914 he enthroned John Watts Ditchfield as Bishop of Chelmsford, amid an atmosphere of fear that militant suffragettes might burn down Chelmsford Cathedral.

Their mother, Blesylda Yadao, is of Chinese Filipino descent while his father is a White American. Career He was considered one of the most dominant and best defensive players early in his PBA Career. He spent most of his time in his last season on the sidelines rather than on the court as he played only 30 games and just 8.9 minutes of playing time per outing, due to ACL injuries in both knees. As a result, the 6-9 center posted a career-low averages of 2.6 points and 2.2 rebounds. Seigle only got a one-year extension from the Ginebra management and with the arrival of Rafi Reavis and Billy Mamaril, his minutes suffered. He retired in 2007 after winning his last championship in the PBA. Philippine National Team Seigle has played twice for the Philippine national basketball team. The first was in 1998 when he played for the Philippine Centennial Team in the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand where he averaged 7.1 points and 2.5 rebounds per game.

He was a chronicler of the early colony, and his writings are a primary source on the land, the Native Americans of the area, and the Jesuit mission in North America. For his efforts in converting and educating the native population, he is frequently referred to as the \\"Apostle of Maryland.\\" He is considered a forefather of Georgetown University, and is memorialized in the name of its White-Gravenor building, a central location of offices and classrooms on the university's campus. Early life in Europe Born in London in 1579, he began formal education at age 14 at the English College at Douai, France. He entered English College of St. Alban's in Valladolid, Spain, in 1595 at the same time as other notable English Catholic priests, including the later Saint and martyr Thomas Garnet. He sought further education in Seville, and was ordained at Douai in 1605, after which he returned to England. Caught up in a wave of anti-Catholic arrests following the Gunpowder Plot, he was arrested and in 1606, banished from England. Moving to Leuven in Belgium, he joined the Society of Jesus on February 1, 1607. Despite the threat of capital punishment, White returned in 1609 to preach in Southern England. At the same time, he took positions as prefect of the seminaries at Louvain and Li√®ge, between which and his English missions he split his time. Sir George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore (1579-1632), whom White is credited in helping to turn to Catholicism in 1625, wrote to White from his colony on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland after 1628. White's further interest in America is shown a letter from Superior General Mutio Vitelleschi in a letter dated March 3, 1629, approving a mission to America. Though Sir George Calvert died in 1632, his eldest son, Cecilius Calvert (1605-1675), inherited the title as second Baron Baltimore, continued the colonization program of his father. Lord Baltimore had wanted White to help found a new colony in the northern Chesapeake Bay which had been chartered by King Charles I on June 20, 1632. White himself wrote of the benefits of converting the native population, and in a document dated February 10, 1633, he specifically advocates Catholic settlement in \\"lord Baltimore's Plantation in Mary-land.\\" He describes to potential financiers a paradisaical land with majestic forests and fruitful soil, advertising of land for each potential settler. Apostle of Maryland English, Latin, and Piscataway languages On November 22, 1633, he took Lord Baltimore's offer and set sail from Cowes, England on the Isle of Wight with planned proprietary first Governor of Maryland, Lord Leonard Calvert (1606-1647), (younger brother of Cecilius Calvert (1605-1675), second Lord Baltimore) and fellow Jesuits John Altham Gravenor and Thomas Gervase on The Ark, one of George Calvert's ships, accompanied by The Dove, crossing the North Atlantic Ocean. After a brief stop further south in Jamestown, Virginia, to consult with colonial authorities there and to resupply, the ships moved north up the Chesapeake Bay, with their landing on March 25, 1634, on St. Clement's Island off the north shore of the Potomac River, slightly upstream from the Chesapeake Bay, marks the birth of the colony of the Province of Maryland. The anniversary of this date is now celebrated annually state-wide as Maryland Day. In erecting a large cross, then celebrating a Catholic Mass of thanksgiving that day, he became the first priest to do so in the original thirteen English colonies.The first Christian mass of any denomination said in what became the United States was celebrated in St. Augustine, Florida, on 1565-09-08. By July of that year, White had written his first discussion on the new colony, titled A Relation of the Sucessefull Beginnings of the Lord Baltimore's Plantation in Maryland. Sections of this were used to further advertise the colony. White spent most of the next decade in St. Mary's City, working on English-Native American relations, particularly with the Yaocomico tribe, which consistently saw favorable trade treaties from Calvert because of White, and the Anacostans. In 1637 they were joined by fellow Jesuits Thomas Copley and Ferdinand Poulton, and between 1634 and 1650 there averaged four permanent Jesuits in the Maryland Provincial Colony. To further his missionary work, he wrote dictionaries and translated the catechism into the native languages. On July 5, 1640, he famously converted Chitomachon, the chief of the Piscataway Indians, to Christianity. The chief was baptized as Charles. He later baptized a princess of the Patuxent Indians, and much of her tribe. In 1933, the architect and writer Christopher La Farge, for the upcoming Tricentenary, 300th Anniversary of the founding of Maryland, designed a monument to Father White that is located just outside St. Mary's City.LaFarge, John, S.J. The Manner Is Ordinary. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1954, pp. 217-18. Return to England The English Civil War (1642-1651), was to cut short his missionary work. In 1644, Richard Ingle and Puritan colonists from the neighboring Virginia colony of Jamestown, which had previously rebuffed George Calvert's visit, first raided the colonial capital at St. Mary's City. Ingle succeeded in burning the town and, with the aid of William Claiborne, (who earlier operated a trading post on Kent Island in the Chesapeake), in controlling the Province of Maryland colony. White was again arrested for his 'evil' preaching, and in 1645 he was sent with Thomas Copley in chains to London. Once there, he was tried for the crime of returning to England after being banished in 1606, which carried the punishment of death. He escaped this fate by arguing that his return was not of his own will. His petitions to return to Maryland denied, he spent the last decade of his life quietly in England until his death on December 27, 1656.

The station was opened on 29 September 1977 in the section between Avtovo and Prospekt Veteranov, replacing the temporary surface station Dachnoye. It is named after the street of the same name, where one of the entrances is located.  Station facilities  There is no above-ground pavilion; entrance to the station is provided through underground pedestrian crossings, with exits onto Leninsky Prospekt and Bulvar Novatorov. Because of the station's shallow depth, neither exit has escalators. Leninsky Prospekt is a shallow column station with a depth of . The underground hall was constructed as a project of the architects A. S. Getskin and Ye. I. Val and the engineer A. N. Yakovlev. The design of the station echoes Lenin's Mausoleum. The platforms and the columns, which widen at the top, are faced with red Karelian granite. Unpolished white marble is used to decorate the walls. In the summer of 2012, the exit onto Leninsky Prospekt was equipped with the first Metro lift in St. Petersburg for people with disabilities.  History  The station was constructed using the same cut and cover method as the neighboring stations Avtovo and Prospekt Veteranov. Until the early 1990s the station was notable in its quadruple commemoration of the name of Lenin in its friezes: \\"V. I. Lenin Metro of Leningrad, order of Lenin.

The Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Ferron, upon which the ancient commune depended, ranges from fifteenth century construction--the round tower--to eighteenth century, harmonized by the warm stone of which it is built and the blue-gray slates of its various roofs. The ancestral seat of the family Hersent Luzarche, bequeathed to the city of Tours in 1951, now houses a collection of furniture, both of the French Renaissance and in Empire style. It is surrounded by a series of parterre gardens, some with clipped topiary, and a landscaped park.

Life Stephen White was born in Clonmel, Ireland, in 1575.\\"Stephen White\\", Ricorso In 1592, Trinity College, Dublin was founded, and S. White (in all probability Stephen White) was one of the few students named in the charter. Unwilling to take the Oath of Supremacy, he left his native land and entered the Irish College in Salamanca, Spain, where in 1596 he joined the Society of Jesus, and taught from 1602 to 1606.Flaherty, Matthew. \\"Stephen White.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 July 2015 From 1606 to 1609 White was professor of Scholastic Philosophy at Ingolstadt. He also held the chair of Theology at Dilingen. He applied himself to the study of history and was generally reputed to be one of the most learned men of his time in Europe. Archbishop Ussher called him a man profoundly versed in the ancient records, not of Ireland alone, but of other countries.Corcoran, T., State Policy in Irish Education, A.D. 1536 to 1816, Fallon Bros., 1916 His chief interest was in Irish history. To him is due the honour of fixing the historic label \\"Scotia\\" to Ireland. He called attention to the treasures of Irish literature preserved in the monasteries and libraries of Germany, and generously supplied many noted scholars, such as Ussher and John Colgan, with accurate copies of Irish manuscripts accompanied by critical emendations and commentaries.Webb, Alfred. \\"Stephen White D.D.\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin, M.H. Gill & son, 1878 It was White who found a copy of Adamnan‚Äôs Vita Sancti Columbae (\\"Life of St. Columba\\") in a chest in Schaffhausen. His biographical notices of early Irish saints were utilized in the \\"Acta SS\\", and the Bollandists acknowledged the assistance which he gave to Father Heribert Rosweyde. What gave him the bent towards early Irish history seems to have been the publication in Frankfurt by William Camden of two works by Gerald of Wales, which he felt libelled Ireland and its people. In refutation he wrote his best-known work Apologia pro Hibernia adversus Cambri calumnias, probably written some time before 1615.White, Stephen. Apologia pro Hibernia adversus Cambri calumnias, (preface), (Matthew Kelly, ed.), Dublin, John O'Daly, 1849 From 1623 to 1627 he was in the Province of Champagne, and from 1627 to 1629 at the college of Metz.\\"Stephen White\\", Centre for Neo-Latin Studies, University College Cork Around 1629 there was a Jesuit college established in Dublin under the patronage of Lady Elizabeth Kildare, widow of Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare. Jane Ohlmeyer believes Father White was probably the Superior.Ohlmeyer, Jane. Making Ireland English, Yale University Press, 2012 The college, however, was after a short time suppressed by the Government, and the property was confiscated and handed over to Trinity College. For some years he laboured in his native Diocese of Waterford and Lismore, mainly engaged in teaching catechism to children. In 1645 he was Superior of the Jesuit College in Galway where he died.

The title character is played by Shaike Ophir (credited as Shay K. Ophir), in what is considered one of his finest performances. The film was nominated for the 1972 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and won the Golden Globe Award in the same category. It won several other awards, such as best foreign film in the Barcelona film festival and best director in the Monte Carlo festival. In Israel, it is considered a cinematic classic. Plot Officer Avraham Azoulay is a patrolman in Tel Aviv's district of Jaffa. He is an honest man, though extremely naive, and because of his character, has never been promoted during his twenty years in the force. He is married to a dull woman (played by veteran actress Zaharira Harifai); the couple have no children. His superiors, Captain Levkovich and First Sergeant Bejerano, decide not to renew his contract, though they feel sorry for him. In the meantime, he falls in love with the simple but charming prostitute Mimi, and removes her photograph from the arrests billboard. His wife finds the photo and tears it to pieces, which Azoulay secretly glues together again. Nevertheless, this love will not be realized as Azoulay refuses to divorce his wife, claiming that \\"it will destroy her\\". In addition, being a Kohen, he cannot marry a prostitute according to Halakha. Azoulay shows some success at dispersing a demonstration without resorting to violence because of his knowledge of the Bible and of Yiddish; he also charms a group of visiting French policemen who adore the French-speaking policeman; in an Arab-speaking club house he gives an unaware speech in Arabic. Azoulay is able to see people for what they are and not what they represent. None of these events, however, help to change his superiors' decision to dismiss him. Azoulay forms a friendship with Amar, unaware that he is a notorious criminal. The criminal and his associates decide to fake a crime and allow Azoulay to catch them in the act so that he receives a promotion and regain his contract. They finally decide upon stealing ritual objects, including a large golden cross, from a monastery in the neighbourhood. Azoulay manages to catch the criminal in the act and is finally promoted to the rank of a sergeant, but his contract is not renewed and he is forced to retire from the police. In the final scene Officer Azoulay leaves the precinct with his new rank and policemen practising marches in the courtyard are being ordered to salute in his direction by Bejerano. The final shot of the film presents Azoulay saluting the marching policemen, thinking that they salute to him, as his eyes fill with tears. This image became one of the most memorable in Israeli cinema. Cast * Shaike Ophir as Constable Sgt. Abraham Azoulay * Zaharira Harifai as Betty Azoulay * Avner Hizkiyahu as Capt.

Thomas White (1593‚Äì1676) was an English Roman Catholic priest and scholar, known as a theologian, censured by the Inquisition, and also as a philosopher contributing to scientific and political debates. Life He was the son of Richard White of Hutton, Essex and Mary, daughter of Edmund Plowden. He was educated at St Omer College and Douai College; and subsequently at Valladolid. He taught at Douai, and was president of the English College, Lisbon. Ultimately he settled in London.Concise Dictionary of National Biography His role in English Catholic life was caricatured by the hostile Jesuit Robert Pugh in terms of the \\"Blackloist Cabal\\", a group supposed to include also Kenelm Digby, Peter Fitton, Henry Holden, and John Sergeant. In fact the Old Chapter was controlled by a Blackloist faction, in the period 1655 to 1660.Article Thomas White in Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), editor Andrew Pyle. Works He wrote around 40 theological works, around which the \\"Blackloist controversy\\" arose, taking its name from his alias Blackloe (Blacklow, Blacloe). The first philosophical work of Thomas Hobbes, which remained unpublished until 1973, was on the De mundo dialogi tres of White, written in 1642.Richard Henry Popkin, The Third Force in Seventeenth-century Thought (1992), p. 11. The Institutionum peripateticarum (1646, English translation Peripatetical Institutions, 1656) represented itself as an exposition of the 'peripatetic philosophy' of Kenelm Digby. It was a scientific work, showing acceptance of the motion of the Earth and ideas of Galileo, but disagreeing with him on the cause of the tides.John L. Russell, Copernican System in Great Britain, p. 223 in Jerzy Dobrzycki, The Reception of Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory (1973).Edward Grant, Planets, Stars, and Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200‚Äì1687 (1996), p. 671. In 1654 he produced an edition of the Dialogues of the controversialist William Rushworth (Richworth). The Grounds of Obedience and Government (1655) was written during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. Its implicit message, the Blackloist line for Catholics, was submission to the de facto ruler. The political aim was to secure an accommodation, and religious tolerance for Catholicism, and this was particularly controversial since the achievement of the objective might be at the cost of the access of Jesuits to England.M. A. Stewart, English Philosophy in the Age of Locke (2000), p. 148. He replied to Joseph Glanvill's The Vanity of Dogmatizing (1661), an attack on Aristotelians, with Scire, sive sceptices (1663).W.

Toward the commercial introduction of hydrogen vehicles in 2015, the HyNor-project focused on acquiring an early pre-commercial fleet of hydrogen vehicles, and keeping a close dialogue with the leading car manufacturers and other similar initiatives in the Nordic countries and around the world. History The HyNor-project started out as a hydrogen highway-project in Norway. It was initiated by large industrial actors such as Statoil and Norsk Hydro in 2003 with the goal of a market- realistic demonstration of hydrogen refuelling stations, as well as hydrogen vehicles. Several hydrogen refuelling stations were built along the route from Oslo to Stavanger. Norway's first hydrogen fueling station was opened in 2006 near Stavanger, the second in Porsgrunn in 2007, and two stations were opened in Oslo and Lier in 2009. There were also hydrogen stations planned for Bergen and Lyngdal, but these projects were never carried out. The official opening of the HyNor hydrogen highway -project took place on 11 May 2009 in Oslo, and most of the stations, except for the one in Stavanger are still in operation today. The infrastructure is part of the Scandinavian hydrogen highway partnership. In October 2011, Statoil announced they wanted to close the hydrogen refuelling stations in Stavanger, Porsgrunn, Drammen and Oslo after 2012. A new company, HyOP,HYOP was established to take over the ownership and operation of the stations, and has done so since May 2012. In June 2012 a new refueling station was opened at Akershus EnergiPark in Skedsmo.BioZeg Vehicles The HyNor-project has tested several different hydrogen vehicles: *15 retrofitted Toyota Prius hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles (2007 - 2012) *4 Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE dual fuel hydrogen/gasoline ICE vehicles (2009 - 2012) *10 Mercedes-Benz B-class F-CELL (2011 - 2014) *5 Think City hydrogen cars *2 Hyundai ix35 FCEVs Current station network * Stavanger - H2 from natural gas reforming (steam reforming), HCNG 8%, at 350 and 700 Bar (shut down in November 2011) * Porsgrunn - H2 byproduct from chlorine production, 700 bar refueling * Drammen - Trucked-in hydrogen, 700 bar refueling (shutdown in 2015 and moved to Oslo airport Gardermoen)http://www.mynewsdesk.com/no/oslo-lufthavn-as/news/oslo-lufthavn- faar-hydrogenstasjon-121152 *Oslo - Trucked-in hydrogen, 700 bar refueling *Oslo - Gaustad - On-site electrolysis (10 Nm3/h), 700 bar refueling *Oslo - Rosenholm - On-site electrolysis (2x60 Nm3/h), 350 bar refueling (bus-only station) *Lillestr√∏m - H2 from biogas via Sorption Enhanced Steam Methane Reforming(SE-SMR) and solar electrolysis, 700 bar refueling.HyNor Lillestr√∏mInnovation Zone of the Hynor Lillestr√∏m Hydrogen Station Now Open See also * Zero Emission Resource Organisation *Scandinavian hydrogen highway partnership *Hydrogen infrastructure *Hydrogen economy References =Notes= External links * hynor.no * Norwegian Hydrogen Forum * HYOP Hydrogen infrastructure Road transport in Norway ","title":"HyNor"},{"id":"9709250","text":"Kemal Bourhani (born 13 September 1981) is a Comorian former footballer who plays as a striker for Entente SSG.

He was born in Pennsylvania and moved with his family to Rowan County, North Carolina in 1750. He was killed at the Battle of Cowan's Ford. Origins and education William Lee Davidson was born in 1746 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His father George Davidson moved with his family to Rowan County, North Carolina, in 1750. William, the youngest son, was educated at Queen's Museum (later Liberty Hall) in Charlotte.

Colonel in the 5th North Carolina Regiment (North Carolina Continental Line) (1777) *Lt. Colonel in the 7th North Carolina Regiment (North Carolina Continental Line) (1777-1778) *Lt. Colonel in the 3rd North Carolina Regiment (North Carolina Continental Line) (1778) *Lt. Colonel over the 1st North Carolina Regiment (North Carolina Continental Line) (1779-1780) *Brigadier General (Pro Tempore) over the Salisbury District Brigade of the North Carolina militia (September 1780 to February 1781) Active in the war from its inception as adjutant to Colonel (later Brigadier General) Griffith Rutherford's Rowan County Regiment during the Snow Campaign in December 1775, he was promoted to major of the Fourth Regiment of the North Carolina line in 1776. He marched with the North Carolina line to the north and was at the Battle of Germantown, after which he was promoted to Lt. Colonel of the Fifth Regiment of the North Carolina line. At Valley Forge with Washington, \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee, Daniel Morgan and others, he became friends with most of the influential military commanders in the Continental Line. Left without a command, he had been ordered out for the purpose of preventing the British from crossing the Catawba. Griffith Rutherford appointed Davidson his second in command. Severely wounded at the Battle of Colson's Mill on July 21, 1780, he did not participate in the Battle of Camden at which Rutherford was captured. Davidson was promoted to brigadier general and given command of Rutherford's Salisbury District Brigade of militia. He participated in resisting the entry of Lord Cornwallis into Charlotte in late September 1780. Brigadier General William Lee Davidson was in Charlotte, North Carolina by December 3, 1780 the day after General Nathanael Greene arrived in Charlottetown as it was then called. After the defeat of the American Forces at the Battle of Camden or as called by most veteran's in their pension records the Battle of Gum Swamp; so it was then that the Continental Congress finally agreed to permit General George Washington to replace General Gates with his best officer. General Washington immediately selected General Nathanael Greene. General Greene arrived later in the day on December 2, 1780 in Charlottetown after a long journey from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and rested. Officially the Change of Command Ceremony took place between General Gates and General Greene on December 3, 1780; and as quickly as he could General Nathanael Greene got to the business at hand to meet his new officers in the field. General William Lee Davidson and General Nathanael Greene had previously met. They were both in the Battle of Brandywine opposing British General Lord Cornwallis in Pennsylvania. Greene recognized that Davidson was very respected and in favor with the local militia in the western half of North Carolina, called the Salisbury Military District over which General Davidson had complete jurisdiction. Greene wanted to capitalize on the opportunity to create a \\"Flying Army\\" that was approved by General Washington. Davidson was going to be the leading Patriot Commander in the field to raise the local militia up as this \\"Flying Army.\\" Having previously served in battle and camped at Valley Forge together, they already had a bond of trust. Davidson was killed at the Battle of Cowan's Ford in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina on February 1, 1781 while opposing the re-entry of Cornwallis into North Carolina. General Davidson was trying to rally his men as the lead British and German elements arrived on the near bank. He was killed within minutes as the engagement unfolded.Stonestreet, O.C.

Based on World War II, the game allows players to pilot fifteen reproductions of that era's military aircraft and to carry out missions for the Axis or Allies. Although it contains dogfights, the game focuses largely on air-to-ground combat, hence the title. Jane's Attack Squadron was first conceived by Looking Glass employee Seamus Blackley as Flight Combat, a combat-based sequel to Flight Unlimited. The company continued designing the game after Blackley was fired in 1995, and it entered production under Electronic Arts in 1998. The team experienced problems with deadlines and funding during development, with the game eventually being heavily redesigned and renamed Jane's Attack Squadron at the request of the publisher. These issues contributed to Looking Glass's bankruptcy and closure in 2000. In 2001 and 2002, the game was acquired and finished by Mad Doc Software, a company in part composed of former Looking Glass employees. The game received mixed to poor reviews. Critics found its physics modeling unrealistic, and many believed that the game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, particularly in light of contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that fans would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors. Gameplay The player flies with friendly planes. As a combat flight simulator, Jane's Attack Squadron allows players to pilot military aircraft in a three- dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The game is set in Western Europe during World War II; and players may control fifteen German and Allied planes from the era, including the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Supermarine Spitfire, Junkers Ju 88, Avro Lancaster and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Although dogfights are possible, the game places a heavy focus on air-to-ground combat. Objectives range from bombing and torpedo runs to defense and escort missions. The player may engage in tutorials, \\"quick missions\\", \\"single missions\\" and a campaign. Quick missions allow the player to select variables such as the objective and the number of friendly and enemy aircraft, while single missions, of which there are five, are scripted, \\"pre-made\\" levels. Two campaigns are available: one each for the Allies and Germans. Both campaigns feature ten missions that branch depending on the outcome achieved by the player. An online multiplayer component allows players to engage in dogfights. Each plane in Jane's Attack Squadron is composed of forty-five parts that may be removed or otherwise damaged in combat. Damage to these parts affects performance; for example, a broken fuel line will leak, quickly decreasing the fuel gauge. Various adjustments may be made to the game's realism, including an \\"arcade physics\\" option that drastically reduces flight difficulty. The game is packaged with the mission and physics editors that were used to develop it. Development =At Looking Glass= In September 1994, Looking Glass Technologies employee Seamus Blackley told Computer Gaming World that he wanted to create a combat- based sequel to Flight Unlimited, whose development he was directing at the time. The magazine's Johnny L. Wilson wrote, \\"If Flight Unlimited can pass the civilian tests, the military version should be right behind it.\\" In March of the next year, Blackley told PC Gamer US that the sequel \\"should feel so real that pilots will be afraid. They'll feel the gun hits.\\" He dismissed the flight dynamics in other flight simulators, such as Falcon 3.0, in favor of the real-time computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) model he created for Flight Unlimited. When PC Gamer's Bernie Yee asked why the team had waited to make a combat flight simulator, Blackley responded that they wanted to \\"retrain\\" players first. In September, Computer Gaming World reported that Blackley was designing a combat-based sequel to Flight Unlimited under the working title Flight Combat. Blackley told them that it would \\"make you into a fighter pilot\\", and the magazine commented that it would teach the same material as the Air Force. The team planned to allow players to practice an element and then execute it on a mission, and Blackley said that the game would feature competitive online play. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Technologies, instated by venture capital investors, demanded that Blackley work on Flight Unlimited II instead of Flight Combat. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. In March 1996, PC Gamer US reported that Flight Combat was \\"still taxiing across the design board\\", and that the team planned to focus \\"on how the aerial manoeuvres are performed as you fight\\". Looking Glass designer Constantine Hantzopoulos told the magazine that a modified version of the Flight Unlimited engine was being used to develop Flight Combat and Flight Unlimited II. Hantzopoulos commented that Flight Combat was \\"the project everybody at Looking Glass wants to work on\\". The team expected to be finished with the game in roughly one year. By June 1997, GameSpot reported that Flight Unlimited II was running on the new ZOAR engine, coded from scratch by programmer James Fleming. In addition, the real-time CFDs model from Flight Unlimited had been discarded, as its programming was \\"all black box spaghetti code from Seamus\\". GameSpot's T. Liam MacDonald noted that the Flight Unlimited II team expected soon to use the same engine for a combat flight simulator set in World War II. Computer Gaming World similarly reported that the company was \\"definitely hot\\" to develop Flight Combat, and that it might be created after Flight Unlimited II. Following that game's completion, the team could not decide between developing Flight Unlimited III or Flight Combat. As a result, they decided to develop them simultaneously, and Flight Combat began production in early 1998. Unlike all of the studio's other games, development of Flight Combat was funded through an insured bond, in an attempt to guarantee that the game would be finished. The company's Tim Stellmach later said that this setup was \\"a real pain for [the team] in some ways\\". Looking Glass signed a multi-game publishing deal with Electronic Arts in May 1998, and that company became the publisher of Flight Combat. The team \\"undersold\\" the game to Electronic Arts, and James Sterrett of the fansite Through the Looking Glass believed that the team \\"gambled that it could get the game out the door faster than the budget actually called for\\". In March 1999, the game was announced as the World War II-themed Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe, directed by Hantzopoulos and scheduled for release in fall of that year. That May, the game was shown at the Electronic Arts booth at E3. Computer Games Magazines Steve Udell wrote that the game would feature a new iteration of the Flight Unlimited terrain renderer, and IGN reported that one million square miles of terrain based on European landscapes would be available. Weather conditions such as snow and rain were planned. Udell wrote that Flight Combats flight physics were an updated version of those from recent Flight Unlimited games, with new material taken from operations manuals and flight tests. Plane models and textures were based on photographs, and many of the moving parts and flight control surfaces were modeled individually. Players were given the option to customize planes. Udell described a physics-based damage system that, according to the company, made it impossible to \\"see the exact same kind of damage twice\\". Two campaigns‚Äîthe Battle of Britain and the Defence of the Reich‚Äîwere announced, with missions based on dogfights, air-to-ground combat and bombing runs. Looking Glass claimed that the game would feature \\"moving tanks and ships duk[ing] it out on a dynamic battlefield\\" as the player carried out missions. Aesthetically, IGN's Tal Blevins noted that the game had \\"a very distinct 40s charm\\", which was present \\"from the briefings to the options screens\\". =Bankruptcy and cancellation= Electronic Arts rebranded Flight Combat as Jane's Attack Squadron, to fit with the Jane's Information Group license that the publisher had used for its Jane's Combat Simulations line. According to Stellmach, the publisher demanded that the game be heavily redesigned \\"partway through\\" development, which exacerbated the team's existing problems with meeting deadlines. Sterrett believed that the game's schedule and funding did not receive the necessary adjustments to allow for this redesign. Together with Flight Unlimited IIIs commercial failure, the expenses of Jane's Attack Squadrons long development used up revenue from Thief: The Dark Project, which had helped the company recover from the failure of Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri and British Open Championship Golf. Compounding these problems, business deals with Microsoft, Irrational Games and Eidos Interactive were unsuccessful. As a result, Looking Glass Studios went bankrupt in May 2000. At the time, Jane's Attack Squadron was roughly three months from completion. Thief II Gold and Thief III were canceled as a result of the company's closure, but Jane's Attack Squadron, because it was near completion and funded through an insured bond, had a chance of being finished. According to Gordon Berg of Computer Gaming World, the legal and logistical problems of keeping \\"a portion of Looking Glass [...] intact\\" to finish the game had been \\"hurdled\\". Further, because of the game's type of funding, the continued development of Jane's Attack Squadron would have been at little cost to Electronic Arts. Fans petitioned the publisher to let development continue, and Looking Glass employee Rich Carlson said that Hantzopoulos and others from the Flight series, roughly twenty in all, were prepared to work on the game again. The petition reached 2,000 signatures by May 30 and 5,000 by June 1. However, Electronic Arts dropped the game. The publisher's Jeff Brown said that the decision \\"was based on our deep uncertainty that the project could meet any schedule given the changes in senior management and a history of missing deadlines.\\" Brown told the website Combatsim that Electronic Arts had \\"worked diligently\\" with Looking Glass for more than two years, and that, although the game had missed its planned October 1999 release, they had been willing to delay the project into 2000. He blamed the developer's closure for the decision to cancel the game. Rumors circulated that the decision was part of the publisher's larger plan to abandon the flight simulator genre, and Computer Gaming Worlds Denny Atkin later summarized that the company \\"ran screaming from the simulation market\\" after Looking Glass's bankruptcy. Electronic Arts soon dropped the Jane's Information Group license. =At Mad Doc Software= After the closure of Looking Glass, certain employees of that company moved to developer Mad Doc Software, and they hoped to complete Jane's Attack Squadron. The game's original lead designer and lead programmer were among those hired by Mad Doc Software. Dotted Line Entertainment, Mad Doc Software's agent company, secured the rights to the game's code for the team in 2001. Development commenced shortly afterward. In August of that year, it was reported that the Jane's Information Group license had been obtained by Xicat Interactive, and that the company planned to publish Mad Doc Software's revival of Jane's Attack Squadron. The full details of the agreement were announced at that year's European Computer Trade Show, where it was revealed that Jane's Attack Squadron would focus heavily on air-to-ground combat. According to Mad Doc Software's Tim Farrar, \\"Our goal wasn't to create a completely new game, it was to complete the game that was started at LG.\\" Farrar noted that, although the company \\"trimmed some of the more ambitious features\\", Jane's Attack Squadron was effectively \\"the same game\\" created by Looking Glass. As with Flight Combat, the game features one million square miles of terrain, planes with individually modeled moving parts and a physics- based damage system. In October 2001, the game was officially announced in a press release by Mad Doc Software. Steve Nadeau, the lead designer of the game at both development studios, said that he looked forward to polishing Jane's Attack Squadron and \\"giv[ing] it a new life\\". He believed that the team was \\"very excited\\" to finish the game, a sentiment later echoed by the game's producer, David Halpern. According to Nadeau, the presence of members of the Looking Glass team ensured that it would \\"closely reflect our original vision of the game: an action-packed World War II air combat simulation accessible to users of all skill levels\\". Farrar announced that the team's mission and physics editors would be released alongside the game, which he hoped would generate interest among players. Farrar later commented that, because of the game's physics-based damage system and individually modeled components, wings could be shot off and fuel tanks detonated. He also explained that coolant tanks could be hit, giving the pilot a limited amount of time before the plane engine overheated. He wrote that losing a wing tip meant \\"a bumpy ride\\", but the loss of the tail caused the plane to \\"spin into the ground\\". Jane's Attack Squadron went gold in March 2002, and was released that month. Reception Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World wrote that Jane's Attack Squadron \\"had the potential to be sim of the year in 2000\\", but that it had been rendered largely irrelevant by delays and \\"unrealized design goals.\\" He believed that its graphics would have been \\"state of the art in 2000\\", but he found them middling in 2002; and he noted the presence of numerous glitches. He considered the game's most serious flaw to be its low number of missions. Although Atkin found the air-to-air combat \\"generally fun\\", citing \\"good pilot AI\\" and \\"decent\\" flight physics, he believed that the game's bombing runs were its most outstanding element. He hoped that fans would use the mission and physics editors to improve the game, and he concluded, \\"It's buggy, but when it works it's worth flying.\\" Andy Mahood of PC Gamer US wrote that Jane's Attack Squadron is \\"unquestionably an entertaining and unique WWII prop sim\\", but he believed that it was clearly inferior to games such as IL-2 Sturmovik. He found the game's graphics to be outdated and its design to be \\"simplistic\\", and he wrote that its \\"somewhat basic flight model\\" prevents advanced maneuvers. He praised the game's sound effects and music, as well as its \\"intricate damage modeling\\", as its best features. He finished by saying that, because the genre was \\"starving for fresh titles\\", Jane's Attack Squadron could be recommended despite its flaws. IGN's Tom Chick found it \\"unrealistic, erratic, and limited\\", writing that it \\"looks bad, plays poorly, and is unstable.\\" He disliked its \\"canned and rigidly scripted missions\\", although he found its bombing runs \\"interesting\\" and its air-to-air combat features acceptable. However, he believed that ease of shooting down aircraft made the damage system's \\"powerful amount of flexibility\\" worthless. Chick believed that the multiplayer component was one of the game's worst features, and he derided the game's \\"suspiciously canned physics\\", which offered \\"a grab bag of fidelity mixed in with heaps of silliness.\\" He summarized Jane's Attack Squadron as \\"awful.\\" Josh Horowitz of The Adrenaline Vault noted the complex damage system, and he believed that the game \\"looks as good as most of today's flight simulators\\", although he experienced performance issues. He noted that the gameplay was hurt by \\"corner cutting or general incompletion\\", such as the limited in-game tutorials. Horowitz found the game \\"repetitive\\" because of its lack of missions and \\"low sense of involvement\\", and, like Chick, he disliked its multiplayer and \\"linear\\" missions. Although he offered significant praise for its sound, Horowitz concluded that the game was \\"a buggy, incomplete offering\\", and that those \\"looking for the next great Jane's title will likely be disappointed.\\" GameSpy's Bernard Dy wrote that the game failed to live up to the Jane's Combat Simulations pedigree, and he believed that those who enjoyed \\"the realism of Il-2 Sturmovik will be disappointed.\\" He disliked its \\"relaxed flight models\\" and lack of features, and he cited a large number of glitches. However, Dy found its damage system \\"robust\\" and he believed that the game was \\"not a total loss.\\" Like Atkin, he hoped that fans would improve the game with its detailed editors, although he believed that this was somewhat unlikely.

He taught as professor of philosophy and theology at Gratz and Vienna. He joined the English mission in 1606, when he became chaplain to the Gages at Hengrave Hall, Suffolk. He was soon arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London (July 1607), and later in the White Lion Prison. He opposed the oath of allegiance and supremacy required by James I's government. Supported by his brother Thomas, an ex- Jesuit, Wright disputed publicly against the oath, and the Gages, whom he had instructed, refused to take it. When the bubonic plague ravaged London and his prison, he nursed the sick; buried the dead, and in the confusion escaped to Leicestershire, where he organized a series of missions, originally called the Residence of St. Anne. From 1612 onwards he took to writing, and a dozen volumes are ascribed to him: three of controversy, the rest translations of the works of Martin Becan, Lessius and others.

Most designs employ metal columns or concrete and steel columns arranged in lines parallel to the long axis of the station. Stations can be double-span with a single row of columns, triple-span with two rows of columns, or multi-span. The typical shallow column station in Russia is triple-span, assembled from concrete and steel, and is from 102 to 164 metres in length with a column spacing of 4-6 m. Along with the typical stations, there are also specially built stations. For example, one of the spans may be replaced with a monolithic vault (as in the Moskovskaya station of the Samara Metro or Sibirskaya of the Novosibirsk Metro). In some cases, one of the rows of columns may be replaced with a load- bearing wall. Such a dual hall, one-span station, Kashirskaya, was constructed to provide a convenient cross-platform transfer. Recently, stations have appeared with monolithic concrete and steel instead of assembled pieces, as Ploshchad Tukaya in Kazan. The typical shallow column station has two vestibules at both ends of the station, most often combined with below-street crossings. For many metro systems outside Russia, the typical column station is a two-span station with metal columns, as in New York City, Berlin, and others. In Chicago, underground stations of the Chicago 'L' are three-span stations if constructed with a centre platform. In the Moscow Metro, approximately half of the stations are of shallow depth, built in the 1960s and 1970s, but in Saint Petersburg, because of the difficult soil conditions and dense building in the centre of the city this was impossible. The Saint Petersburg Metro has only five shallow-depth stations altogether, with three of them having the column design: Avtovo, Leninsky Prospekt, and Prospekt Veteranov. The first of these is less typical, as it is buried at a significant depth, and has only one surface vestibule.

Set in Alabama, it is based on a screenplay about the Montgomery bus boycott (1955‚Äì1956) by John Cork and a short film by the same name, produced by students at the University of Southern California in 1988. Origins The feature film is based on a short screenplay and film of the same name, written by John Cork, then a graduate student in directing at USC. He had submitted his script to the Cinema Department for consideration, hoping also to direct it. While USC selected Cork's script for production, the department assigned Beverlyn E. Fray, another student, to direct it. The scenario on which the film is based, actually happened to Cork and his maid, Elizabeth Gregory Taylor, in his hometown of Montgomery, Alabama. The short film won several awards, including first place at the Black American Cinema Society. Cork, however, was unhappy with the finished project and unsuccessfully tried to block screenings of the short film. Plot The film was expanded as a feature. Set in Montgomery, Alabama, United States, during the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, it follows Odessa Carter (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman who works as a maid/nanny for Miriam Thompson (Sissy Spacek). Odessa and her family confront typical issues faced by African Americans in the South at the time: poverty, racism, segregation, and violence. The black community has begun a widespread boycott of the city-owned buses to end segregation; Odessa is forced to take long walks both ways to work. Miriam Thompson offers to give her a ride two days a week to ensure she gets to work on time and to lessen the fatigue her \\"long walk home\\" is causing. Around the city, some informal carpools and other systems are starting, but most of the blacks are forced to walk to work. As the boycott continues, tensions rise in the city. Blacks had been the majority riders on the city-owned buses, and the system is suffering financially. Miriam's decision to support Odessa by giving her a ride becomes an issue with her husband, Norman Thompson (Dwight Schultz), and other prominent members of the white community who want the boycott to end. Miriam has to choose between what she believes is right or succumb to pressure from her husband and their friends. After an argument with her husband, Miriam decides to follow her heart. She becomes involved in a carpool group to help other black workers like Odessa. In the film's final scene, Miriam and her daughter Mary Catherine (Lexi Randall), who is the narrator of the story in flashback, join Odessa and the other protesters in standing against oppression.

(Her arrest was the catalyst for the black community's calling the boycott.) By the time of the film, the bus was in poor condition. The filmmakers had it given a partial repaint and towed it by a cable for its scenes in the movie. It is now owned by the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, where it is on permanent display. Cinematographer John Bailey was to have made his directorial debut on this film but was replaced by Richard Pearce early into production. Release The film was released theatrically on December 21, 1990. In the U.S., it gained another theatrical release in March 1991 after Miramax withdrew the film from its limited December 1990 release due to the heavy competition of the 1990 holiday season. After the film's theatrical run, it was released to videocassette by Live Home Video in the United States and in Canada that same year by Cineplex Odeon. In 2002, the film was released twice on DVD by Platinum Disc and Artisan Entertainment, both presented in full- screen without bonus features. Both DVDs are now discontinued. On January 29, 2013, a new DVD was released by Lionsgate, under license from Miramax. It is still in full-screen and does not contain any bonus features. A widescreen DVD is available in Spain. Reception = Critical response = The Long Walk Home received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of 16 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.7 out of 10. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the performances by Spacek and Goldberg, while criticizing some aspects of the film, like the inclusion of a white \\"narrator\\".

Radulf's youth is obscure, and it is not until the 1220s that he emerges in the sources as a Tironensian monk, now Abbot of Arbroath. He held the leadership of Arbroath Abbey until 1239, when he was chosen to succeed Gilbert de Stirling as Bishop of Aberdeen. According to Hector Boece, he was selected purely on merit and maintained his ascetic life after becoming a bishop. This apparently included increasing the asceticism of the cathedral clergy, retaining the light diet of the monk and making his episcopal visitations on foot. Among the notable acts of his episcopate, he exempted the churches owned in corporation by the chapter from episcopal dues and confirmed the grants made by his predecessor bishops. He also excommunicated the murderers of Padraig, Earl of Atholl (d. 1241). He died in the year 1247, sometime before 13 May when his successor Peter de Ramsay received a papal mandate for consecration. References * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J.

The PTA became an independent company - though still with close links to the Polytechnic - in 1911. Later it changed its name to Poly Travel, before being acquired in 1962 along with the firm Sir Henry Lunn Ltd. A few years later, the two firms were merged and eventually rebranded as Lunn Poly (and later on as Thomson Holidays). The PTA was one of a number of British travel agencies formed in the latter part of the 19th century, following on from the pioneering efforts of Thomas Cook. History Members of the Polytechnic had taken holidays at the homes of its founder, Quintin Hogg (1845-1903), including Holly Hill in Hampshire, but increasing numbers meant that this became impractical. In 1886 trips for members were arranged to Switzerland and Boulogne. In 1888 a party of boys from the Polytechnic School toured Belgium and Switzerland to see the mountains they were learning about in geography lessons. In 1889 arrangements were made for Polytechnic parties to visit the Paris Exhibition. In subsequent years, the tours were opened up to those who were neither students nor members of the Polytechnic. Cruises to Norway began in 1892. In 1894 the Director of Education Robert Mitchell (1855-1933) acquired chalets by Lake Lucerne which were to become the most famous centre for the Polytechnic Touring Association. A notable achievement was the organisation of a series of trips to Chicago to see the World's Fair in 1893: more than 1,000 people made the month-long journey. By 1894 the Continental tours had more than 3,000 participants, increasing to 12,000 by 1903. The steam yacht \\"Ceylon\\" was purchased in 1896 for cruises of the Norwegian fjords. Polytechnic employees acted as guides. However, in 1896-97, the travel firm Thomas Cook and Son sent several complaints to the Department for Education regarding the tours being subsidised by governmental grants.http://archivesearch.westminster.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id;=PTA%2f1%2f2 The name 'Polytechnic Touring Association' emerged around the year 1900, although its organisation was still within the Polytechnic. Its trips claimed to pioneer cheaper travel, making it accessible to less affluent middle-class and lower middle-class travellers. Its office was adjacent to the main entrance of the Regent Street Polytechnic building. The tours were initially organised within the general administration of the Polytechnic, though after the Scheme of Administration in 1891, there was pressure from the auditors to separate out the accounts and administration. Robert Mitchell remained the driving force until after World War One. The continued expansion of the firm after 1918 was due largely to the leadership of Commander Ronald G Studd: when he left the Navy in 1921 his father, Sir Kynaston Studd, President of the Polytechnic, invited him to take over the management of the tours. He did this very successfully, expanding the range of tours to include southern Europe but continuing to focus on Switzerland as the primary PTA destination. Kynaston Studd was PTA chairman until his death in 1944; Ronald Studd, as well as being PTA Managing Director, was on the Polytechnic Board of Governors. The PTA offices remained on Polytechnic premises until 1950 and the agency made annual donations to the Polytechnic to support its work. When the Creative Tourist Agents Conference was formed, Ronald Studd became chairman; he was also the first vice-chairman of ABTA when it was created in 1950. In 1962 Poly Travel (as it had been renamed in 1958) was acquired by Harold Bamberg, who also acquired the firm of Henry Lunn Ltd and eventually merged the firms to form the travel retailer Lunn Poly (rebranded as Thomson Holidays in 2005).

Microsoft Corp., also known as Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., was a long-running patent infringement case between Alcatel- Lucent and Microsoft litigated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and appealed multiple times to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Alcatel-Lucent was awarded $1.53 billion in a final verdict in August 2007 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. The damages award was reversed on appeal in September 2009,Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., and the case was returned for a separate trial on the amount of damages. Origin The dispute between Microsoft and Lucent (and later Alcatel-Lucent) began in 2003 when Lucent Technologies (merged with Alcatel in 2006) filed suit against Gateway and Dell in U.S. District Court, San Diego, California. Lucent claimed in this first San Diego case that Dell and Gateway had violated patents on MP3-related technologies developed by Bell Labs, a division of predecessor company American Telephone & Telegraph. Other patents said to be infringed relate to MPEG video technology, speech technology, internet technology, and other technologies. Microsoft voluntarily joined the lawsuit in April 2003 and Alcatel was added after it acquired Lucent. After the first San Diego lawsuit was filed, Microsoft and Lucent have filed additional patent lawsuits against each other. In February 2007, Microsoft filed a lawsuit at the International Trade Commission claiming that Alcatel-Lucent infringed its patents.ITC to rule on Microsoft, Alcatel-Lucent IPR spat DSP DesignLine There is a second case in San Diego where Microsoft is asserting that Alcatel- Lucent infringes 10 of its patents, and yet another case in Texas where each alleges that the other is infringing its patents.Microsoft's Court Battles With Alcatel-Lucent Far From Over InformationWeek  Patents  In the first San Diego case, Alcatel-Lucent claims ownership of several patents relating to MP3 and MPEG encoding and compression technologies, as well as other technologies. The patents were obtained as the result of work done at Bell Labs before the breakup of American Telephone & Telegraph. Certain patents at issue were: U.S. Patent No. 5,341,457, Perceptual Coding of Audio Signals, to Joseph L. Hall and James D. Johnston. Filed: August 20, 1993 Granted: August 23, 1994.

Trials  The first part of the San Diego case involved the '457 and '080 audio coding patents. Alcatel- Lucent claimed that Microsoft's Windows Media Player infringed these patents by virtue of its MP3 capabilities. Testimony was given by inventors James Johnston and Joseph Hall. Coincidentally, AT&T; inventor James Johnston was employed by Microsoft post-AT&T; breakup and during the trial. Additional testimony was taken from Dr. Karlheinz Brandenburg, who worked with Johnston at Bell Labs. On February 22, 2007, a San Diego jury found for Alcatel-Lucent and against Microsoft. Alcatel-Lucent was awarded a record-breaking $1.52 billion in damages. The damages could have been $4.5 billion but the jury was unable to decide if the infringement was \\"willful.\\" Microsoft disputed the verdict, maintaining that the federal jury's decision was \\"unsupported by the law or facts\\", since Microsoft had already paid $16 million to license the technology from Fraunhofer IIS which, it claims, is \\"the industry-recognized rightful licensor\\".Microsoft hit with $1.5 billion patent verdict CNET News.com Subsequently, on August 6, 2007 the federal judge in San Diego, U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster, granted Microsoft's motions for Judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) and for new trial, saying that the jury's decision was not supported by the evidence. The Judge's Order Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., found that there was insufficient evidence both for Microsoft's liability and for the damages model used by Alcatel-Lucent. Alcatel-Lucent appealed the judge's decision, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard oral arguments in July 2007. The Court of Appeals published its decision Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., on September 25, 2008, upholding the dismissal of the case by Judge Brewster on two grounds. The court held that Fraunhofer was a joint developer and thus co-owner of one patent, which meant that Lucent lacked standing to sue. The other patent was not infringed because Lucent failed to show that the patented algorithm was ever used by Microsoft's products. A week after the first jury verdict, on March 2, Judge Brewster granted summary judgment in the second part of the case that Microsoft had not violated Alcatel-Lucent's patents relating to speech recognition, and the case was therefore dismissed before going to trial. Alcatel-Lucent stated that it intended to appeal. The trial in the third part of the San Diego case involved four patents. In April 2008, a jury awarded Alcatel-Lucent $367.4 million in damages after finding that Microsoft had violated two patents related to the user interface in its software.Jury rules for Alcatel in Microsoft patent case Reuters One of the patents. found infringed by Microsoft's Tablet PC products involved technology originally developed by GO Corp. concerning gestures using a stylus on a tablet computer.

In June 2008, the trial judge upheld the jury's verdict and increased the damage award against Microsoft to $512 million to account for interest. In the fourth San Diego case, the jury issued its verdict on June 2, 2008. This time both Microsoft and Lucent were asserting that the other side was infringing its patents. The jury found that Lucent did not infringe Microsoft's patents (and one patent was invalid) and that Microsoft's Xbox did not infringe Lucent's patent. Settlement In November 2008, Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent announced they had agreed to settle of most of the patent litigation between the companies. The case on appeal regarding user interfaces, in which Alcatel-Lucent was awarded $512 million, was excluded from this settlement agreement.

The Model 110 has been in continuous production since that time. History The Model 110 was developed to give the hunters a strong and powerful yet light and affordable rifle. Its model number is derived from its initial retail price of $109.95. It was originally made for .30-06 Springfield and .270 Winchester ammunition. In 1959, a short-action version was introduced, chambered in .243 Winchester and .308 Winchester. The same year, the Model 110 was the first commercial bolt-action rifle sold in a left-handed configuration.Greenleaf, Bob; The Savage Model 110 Rifle, Precision Shooting Magazine, July 1997 In 1966, the Model 110's design was altered to improve performance and reduce production costs. Changes included a new adjustable trigger and a new bolt with a plunger-type ejector passing through the bolt face rather than the magazine-mounted, spring-loaded ejector that was part of Brewer's original design. The new ejector allowed the use of detachable box magazines. A model with a hinged floorplate was also introduced that year. When Savage Arms filed for bankruptcy in 1988, the firm cut its product line down to only the most basic Model 110 rifles. The design has since succeeded in bringing the company back to life as one of the largest bolt-action rifle makers in America. In 1998, Savage re-engineered the short-action Model 110 and adopted a new model numbering scheme to differentiate short-action models from long actions. The short-action Model 110 became the Model 10, while the long-action model remained the Model 110. The Model 110 is the basis for the entire line of Savage centerfire bolt-action rifles, including the Models 11/111, 12, 14/114, 16/116, and Model 210 bolt-action shotgun as well as the Stevens Model 200. The series is available in a wide variety of chamberings, from .204 Ruger to .338 Winchester Magnum, to suit the needs of most shooters. Addressing concerns about what was considered by many to be a weak point of the design, Savage introduced the AccuTrigger for the 110 series in 2003. Those rifles equipped with an AccuTrigger are adjustable by the end user through the turning of a single screw, offering a pull weight from one-and-a-half to six pounds. Target and select Varmint model rifles are adjustable down to six ounces.Metcalf, Dick; Innovative, Remarkable, Reliable... Getting Inside Savage's AccuTrigger, Shooting Times Magazine, 2003Savage Arms 2007 Catalog Design Savage 110 BA The Model 110 was designed to be economical from the start. Many of its smaller parts are accordingly made from investment castings and steel stampings. The action and barrel are made from forged steel bar stock. The barrel is threaded into the receiver and fixed via a large locknut located just ahead of the receiver, with a recoil lug sandwiched between the two. This system allows barrels to be changed or headspace to be adjusted relatively easily, making for an extremely accurate yet inexpensive rifle. The bolt is an easily manufactured assembly, consisting of a tube with a rotating forward baffle and the bolt head (with locking lugs) at one end, a removable handle attached via a threaded bolt and a rotating rear baffle at the rear of the assembly. A striker assembly is held within. The receiver and bolt designs make the rifle relatively simple to produce with a left-handed bolt. So, it is popular among left-handed users. The bolt head of the Model 110 is a \\"floating\\" design: A flat spring located behind the front baffle and bolt head assembly gives the assembly a small amount of free movement lateral to the bore axis. This motion assures that the locking lugs fully contact the receiver and so headspace is held to a minimum every time the bolt is locked. This feature is a significant factor contributing to the accuracy of the rifle. The bolt head is a replaceable part. This means that if the user wishes to re-barrel the rifle for use with a different cartridge, the bolt head can be changed to a new case head diameter. This allows for a much wider range of cartridge interchangeability at less expense. Each bolt head type includes a different means of cartridge ejection. The push-feed bolt heads utilize a plunger-type ejector mounted in the bolt face. The controlled-round-feed bolt heads have a relief cut for a receiver-mounted, spring-loaded folding ejector to pass through as the bolt is retracted. The safety is a three-position type, mounted in an ambidextrous position on the receiver tang, behind the bolt. The forward position is fire, the middle position locks the trigger while allowing the bolt to be opened and the rifle unloaded, and the rear position locks both the trigger and the bolt. The bolt-release lever is located on the right side of the action (on right-handed models) behind the ejection port. Pressing this lever down while pulling the unlocked bolt to the rear allows the bolt to be removed from the rifle for cleaning.

Asgill enjoyed a long military career, eventually rising to the rank of general. He is best remembered as the principal of the so-called \\"Asgill Affair\\" of 1782, in which his retaliatory execution while a prisoner of war was commuted by the American forces who held him, due to the direct intervention of the government of France. Early life and education Asgill's handwriting in 1778: \\"An Honest Man is the noblest work of God.\\" Charles Asgill was born in London on 6 April 1762, the only son of one-time Lord Mayor of London Sir Charles Asgill and Sarah Theresa Pratviel, whose home was Richmond Place, now known as Asgill House, in Surrey. He was educated at Westminster School and the University of G√∂ttingen. He entered the army on 27 February 1778, just before his 16th birthday, as an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards, a regiment today known as the Grenadier Guards. Asgill became lieutenant in the same regiment with the rank of captain in February 1781. Soon afterwards, Asgill was ordered to North America to fight in the American Revolutionary War. He shipped out for America in March 1781. After Asgill joined Cornwallis's army, his company commander fell ill. The young lieutenant and captain Asgill took charge of the unit and led it in a successful attack on a post held by local militia under an elderly colonel named Gregory. Colonel Gregory was wounded and captured, and Asgill won the admiration of his enemies for his kindness toward a fallen foe. Roger Lamb, writing in 1809, quoted an extract from a Hibernian Magazine article of 1782, which he wrote \\"may serve to shew what was the prevailing opinion of the day relative to that officer\\": Captain Asgill became an American prisoner of war following the capitulation of Lord Cornwallis following the siege of Yorktown, Virginia, in October 1781.

Map showing locations of Colonel Elias Dayton's house and Timothy Day's Tavern as they were in 1782. OpenStreetMap In April 1782, a captain of the Monmouth Militia and privateer named Joshua Huddy was overwhelmed and captured by Loyalist forces at the blockhouse (small fort) he commanded at the village of Toms River, New Jersey. Huddy was accused of complicity in the death of a Loyalist farmer named Philip White who had died in Patriot custody. Huddy was conveyed to New York City, then under British control, where he was summarily sentenced to be executed by William Franklin, the Loyalist son of Benjamin Franklin. Huddy was held in leg irons aboard a prison ship until 12 April 1782, when he was taken ashore and hanged, after first being allowed to dictate his last will. Loyalists pinned a note to his chest reading \\"Up Goes Huddy for Philip White\\" and his body was left hanging overnight. Following his burial at Old Tennent Church by Patriotic supporters, a petition was collected demanding retribution for Huddy's death and presented to American commander General George Washington. Washington responded to this pressure by declaring that a British captain would be executed in retaliation for the killing of Huddy. On 27 May 1782, lots were drawn at the Black Bear Inn, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with Asgill's name being drawn by a drummer boy, together with the paper marked \\"Unfortunate\\", which put him under threat of execution. Asgill's fellow officer, Major James Gordon, protested in the strongest terms to both General Washington and Benjamin Lincoln, the Secretary of War, that this use of a lottery was illegal. After lots were drawn on 27 May 1782, Brigadier General Moses Hazen who had been in charge of the proceedings, wrote that same day to Washington to inform him that Major James Gordon had identified unconditional prisoners, but that Asgill was on his way to imprisonment for the next six months, where he awaited the gallows on a daily basis. He also told Washington that his orders of 3 and 18 May 1782 had been painful for him to carry out. \\"Since I wrote the above Majr Gordon has furnished me with an Original Letter of which the inclosed is a Copy, by which you will see we have a Subaltern Officer and unconditional Prisoner of War at Winchester Barracks. I have also just received Information that Lieut. Turner, of the 3rd Brigade of Genl Skinner's New-Jersey Volunteers is in York Goal‚Äîbut as those Informations did not come to Hand before the Lots were drawn, and my Letters wrote to your Excellency and the Minister of War on the Subject, and as I judge no Inconveniency can possibly arise to us by sending on Capt. Asgill, to Philadelphia, which will naturally tend to keep up the Hue and Cry, and of course foment the present Dissentions amongst our Enemies, I have sent him under guard as directed. Those Officers above-mentioned are not only of the Description which your Excellency wishes, and at first ordered [on 3 May], but in another Point of View are proper Subjects for Example, been Traitors to America, and having taken refuge with the Enemy, and by us in Arms. It have fallen to my Lot to superintend this melancholy disagreeable Duty, I must confess I have been most sensible affected with it, and [do] most sincerely wish that the Information here given may operate in favour of Youth, Innocence, and Honour\\". From Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Asgill was conveyed to Chatham, New Jersey, where he was under the jurisdiction of Colonel Elias Dayton, and in close proximity to the people of Monmouth County, who wished him to atone for Huddy's execution. Dayton housed Asgill in his own quarters and treated him kindly. However, in a P.S. to his letter to Dayton of 11 June 1782, Washington wrote telling him to send Asgill to the Jersey Lines under close arrest, adding that he should be \\"treated with all the Tenderness possible, consistent with his present Situation\\". In the event, however, Asgill was sent, under close arrest, to Timothy Day's Tavern. On hearing of her son's impending execution, Asgill's mother, Sarah Theresa, Lady Asgill (who was of French Huguenot origin), wrote to the French court, pleading for her son's life to be spared. King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette ordered the comte de Vergennes, the Foreign Minister, to convey to General Washington their desire that a young life be spared. Since France had also signed the Treaty of Capitulation, protecting prisoners of war from retaliation, they too were bound to honour the terms. Asgill was thus protected by the 14th Article of Capitulation in the document of Cornwallis's surrender, safeguarding prisoners of war. Such an unjustified execution would have reflected badly on France, as well as the newly emerging independent nation of America. Lady Asgill's letter, together with that from Vergennes, were presented to Congress for their consideration. These letters arrived just as Congress was about to vote to execute Asgill, but after much debate Congress agreed that young Asgill should be released on parole to return to England. He arrived home in December 1782, following his six month captivity. A year later, together with his mother (who had been too ill to travel sooner) and his two eldest sisters, he went to France to thank the King and Queen for saving his life. The visit commenced on 3 November 1783. Asgill writes about this experience in his Service Records, in which he states, \\"The unfortunate Lot fell on me and I was in consequence conveyed to the Jerseys where I remained in Prison enduring peculiar Hardships for Six Months until released by an Act of Congress at the intercession of the Court of France.\\"Anne Ammundsen, \\"Saving Captain Asgill,\\" History Today, vol. 61, no. 12 (December 2011). On page 44 of Summit New Jersey, From Poverty Hill to the Hill City by Edmund B. Raftis there appears a map of Chatham in 1781. Clearly marked is the home of Colonel Dayton and also Timothy Day's Tavern, the first and second locations of Asgill's imprisonment. The map also shows that the population of Chatham at that time was approximately 50 homesteads, most of these homes having been notated with the names of the occupants. A 21st century map shows that the present day location of Timothy Day's Tavern would be in the vicinity of 19 Iris Road and Dayton's house was on what is now Canoe Brooke Golf Course. It was recorded in The Reading Mercury (a British local newspaper) on 30 December 1782, that Asgill (newly returned home following imprisonment in America) was at the lev√©e for the first time since his arrival in town. This newspaper also recorded that Asgill's legs were still damaged from the use of leg irons. Following Asgill's return to England, lurid accounts of his experiences whilst a prisoner began to emerge in the coffee houses and press, and French plays were written about the affair. Washington was angered that the young man did not deny these rumours, nor did he write to thank Washington for his release on parole. Speculation mounted as to his reasons; Washington ordered that his correspondence on the Asgill Affair be made public. His letters on the matter were printed in the New-Haven Gazette and the Connecticut Magazine on 16 November 1786, with the exception of his letter written to General Moses Hazen on 18 May 1782, ordering him to include conditional prisoners in the selection of lots, thereby violating the 14th Article of Capitulation. It was five weeks before Charles Asgill was able to obtain a copy and sit down to read the account of his experiences, as recorded by George Washington. He wrote an impassioned response by return of post. His letter was also sent to the editor of the New-Haven Gazette and the Connecticut Magazine. Asgill's 18-page letter of 20 December 1786, including claims that he was treated like a circus animal, with drunken revellers paying good money to enter his cell and taunt or beat him, was not published. Supposedly left for dead after one such attack, he was subsequently permitted to keep a Newfoundland dog to protect himself. > I leave for the public to decide how far the treatment I have related > deservd acknowledgements ‚Äî the motives of my silence were shortly theseThe > state of my mind at the time of my release was such that my judgement told > me I could not with sincerity return thanksmy feelings would not allow me to > give vent to reproaches Asgill's unpublished letter was offered for sale by an antiquarian bookseller in the United States in 2007, priced at $16,500. It was purchased by an anonymous private collector. It has since been published, in the Winter 2019 issue of the Journal of Lancaster County's Historical Society. On 12 April 1982, a bicentennial commemorative cover for the Huddy-Asgill affair was produced. Historian Louis Masur argues that the Huddy-Asgill affair, in particular, \\"injected the issue of the death penalty into public discourse\\" and increased American discomfort with it. Subsequent career The hot water urn presented to Charles Asgill by the people of Clonmel at the end of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Asgill was appointed equerry to Frederick, Duke of York in 1788; he would hold this post until his death.Royal Kalendar for 1823, p. 127. On 15 September 1788 he inherited the Asgill baronetcy upon the death of his father,G. E. C., The Complete Baronetage, vol. V (1906) pp. 120‚Äì121. and on 3 March 1790 he was promoted to command a company in the 1st Foot Guards, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. On 28 August 1790 he married Jemima Sophia, sixth daughter of Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, 1st Baronet. He joined the Army on the Continent in late 1793, and served in the Flanders campaign under the Duke of York. He was present during the retreat through Holland in the winter of 1794, then returned to England. On 26 February 1795 he was granted the rank of colonel, and later that year commanded a battalion of the Guards at Warley Camp, intended for foreign service. In June 1797, Asgill was appointed brigadier-general on the Staff in Ireland. He was granted the rank of major-general on 1 January 1798,John Philippart, The Royal Military Calendar (1815) vol. I, pp. 115‚Äì116. and was promoted Third MajorThird major is another position peculiar to Household and Guard regiments of the time. Nominally the second-in-command of each battalion (normally a major's appointment), by seniority of battalions within the regiment (ie the third battalion), these positions would be owned by more senior officers. (See from .) of the 1st Foot Guards in November that year. In his Service Records, he states he \\"was very actively employed against the Rebels during the Rebellion in 1798 and received the repeated thanks of the Commander of the Forces and the Government for my Conduct and Service.\\" General Sir Charles Asgill marched from Kilkenny and attacked and dispersed the rebels. The Irish song Sliabh na mBan remembers this. Asgill was presented with a silver hot- water urn by the people of Clonmel in appreciation of his part in the uprising. The inscription on the urn reads: \\"PRESENTED by the Inhabitants of the Town and Neighbourhood of CLONMEL to MAJr. GENl. SIR CHAs ASGILL BARt. in token of their great regard for His unremitting exertions as General Commanding in the district in defeating the Schemes of the Seditious and Protecting the loyal Inhabitants. CLONMEL MDCCCI\\". The city of Kilkenny presented Asgill with a snuff box for his \\"energy and exertion\\" which was praised by the Loyalists. On 9 May 1800 Asgill was transferred from the Foot Guards to be colonel commandant of the 2nd Battalion, 46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot. He went onto half-pay when the 2nd Battalion was disbanded in 1802. Later that year he was again appointed to the Staff in Ireland, commanding the garrison in Dublin and the instruction camps at the Curragh. Promoted to lieutenant general in January 1805, he was appointed Colonel of the Regiment of the 5th West India Regiment (February 1806); of the 85th Regiment of Foot (October 1806); and, of the 11th (North Devonshire) Regiment (25 February 1807), for which he raised a second battalion in the space of six months. He continued to serve on the Staff until 1812, and on 4 June 1814 he was promoted to general. In 1820 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Hanoverian Guelphic Order.William A. Shaw, The Knights of England (1906) vol. I, p. 449. Death and legacy Coat of arms of Sir Charles Asgill, 2nd Baronet. The motto translates as \\"regardless of his own interest\\". a 1791 portrait of the Duchess of York by John Hoppner shows Asgill's wife Sophia sitting at her feet. Lady Asgill was Lady of the Bedchamber to the Duchess, and was godmother to Hoppner‚Äôs granddaughter, Helen Clarence. From 1791 to 1821 No. 6 York Street (subsequently renamed 7 Duke of York Street) was occupied by General Sir Charles Asgill, who was succeeded, from 1822 to 1824, by General Sir Ulysses Burgh. The final two years of his life were spent at the home of his mistress, Mary Ann Goodchild (otherwise Mansel) (who was also mistress to General Robert Manners) at 15 Park Place South near The Man in the Moon, Chelsea. Two codicils to his will were written and signed there shortly before his death. Asgill died on 23 July 1823, and was buried in the vault at St James's Church, Piccadilly on 1 August. His wife, Sophia Asgill, had predeceased him in 1819 and she too was buried in the vault at St. James's. Upon his death, the Asgill baronetcy became extinct. Most biographies claim he died without issue (excepting A New Biographical Dictionary of 3000 Cotemporary (sic) Public Characters, Second Edition, Vol I, Part I, printed for Geo. B. Whittacker, Ave-Maria Lane, 1825, which states Sophia bore him children).A New Biographical Dictionary of 3000 Cotemporary (sic) Public Characters, Second Edition, Vol I, Part I, printed for Geo. B. Whittacker, Ave-Maria Lane, 1825 St. James's Church was damaged in the Blitz of London on 14 October 1940. After the war ended, specialist contractors, Rattee and Kett, of Cambridge, under the supervision of Messrs. W. F. Heslop and F. Brigmore, undertook restoration work, which was completed in 1954. In his book, \\"Voice of rebellion : Carlow 1798 : the autobiography of William Farrell\\", the author gives a detailed account of how Lady Asgill was instrumental in saving his life. She had persuaded her husband, General Sir Charles Asgill, in Command of the Dublin Garrison at the time, that since a Lady (Queen Marie Antoinette of France) had saved his life, that he must, therefore, save the life of William Farrell who faced the gallows on account of his part in the Irish Uprising of 1798. Farrell was thus spared the gallows, but was deported for seven years. Asgill's story seems to have gone full circle as a consequence. The Lady Olivia character in the 1806 novel Leonora by Maria Edgeworth was rumoured to have been based on Lady Asgill, portraying her as a \\"coquette\\". Lady Asgill herself maintained a two-decades long secret correspondence with Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch. The two had agreed to destroy each other's correspondence, but some letters survived as Lynedoch did not destroy them all. A graphite drawing of Lady Asgill's setter dog was created at the Lynedoch Estate in Scotland by Charles Loraine Smith. During the months leading up to Asgill's death in 1823, he was the victim of fraud. \\"The Swindler Asgill\\" was touring southern England persuading his victims to send the bill for his luxury purchases to his \\"uncle\\", Sir Charles Asgill. He was never caught, but the Southern Reporter and Cork Commercial Courier of Saturday 13 September 1823 states: \\"There is good reason to believe that the real name of 'Mr Asgill' has been discovered, and that it is not altogether unknown to fame in the annals of police: but for obvious reasons, we omit it for the present\\". The Swindler perpetuated his lies, through his children, so that the present-day generation believed themselves to be descendants of Asgill's \\"disinherited son\\", William Charles Asgill. Even his obituary, in the Blackburn Standard of Wednesday 22 February 1854, declared that he was the \\"second son of the late Charles Asgill\\" ‚Äì stating the latter was \\"of Regents Park\\". General Sir Charles Asgill never had an address in \\"Regents Park\\". Images Asgill depicted in Two Girls of Old New Jersey: A School-Girl Story of '76, written by Agnes Carr Sage and illustrated by Douglas John Connah. The image's caption reads \\"'Clemency! For the British prisoner, Your Excellency!'\\". Depictions of Asgill include: *The Thomas Phillips RA portrait of Charles Asgill, painted in 1822 and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts London that year, is listed in the National Portrait Gallery, London catalogue for the 1822 exhibition, and is recorded as: 107 Portrait of Gen. Sir Charles Asgill, Bart. G.C.G.O. T Phillips. R.A. The current whereabouts of this portrait is unknown. Asgill bequeathed it to his brother-in-law Sir Charles Ogle, 2nd Baronet for his family, in perpetuity. After Asgill's death Ogle wrote to the artist to ask if he could take possession and whether he was still due payment. > Sir Charles Ogle requests Mr Philips will have the goodness to deliver the > picture of the late Sir Charles Asgill to the bearer Mr Goslett - If Mr > Philips has any demand on Sir Charles Asgill, he is requested to send it to > Mr Domville, [at] No. 6 Lincolns Inn. 42 Berkeley Sq, Oct 23 1823. :At the time of his death Ogle disinherited his eldest son, Chaloner, 1803‚Äì1859 (who died less than a year after his father), so it is not known whether the portrait did remain in the Ogle family as Asgill had requested. *Charles Asgill as a Captain in the First Foot Guards, held at the Library of Congress *General Sir Charles Asgill.

The Asgill Affair in literature * A historical novel written by Agnes Carr Sage, Two Girls of Old New Jersey: A School-Girl Story of '76, was published in 1912. It follows the events of 1782, and Asgill's impending execution. This fictionalised account introduces Asgill as a romantic hero who becomes engaged to be married to a Loyalist schoolteacher, Madeline Burnham, in Trenton, New Jersey. * French author Charles-Joseph Mayer's 1784 novel, Asgill, or the Disorder of Civil Wars (), also tells the story of 1782. Scholar Kristin Cook cites analysis of Mayer's book as an example of the critical attention the Asgill Affair has received, noting that \\"literary scholar Jack Iverson...reads the political impasse of its exposition as initially translated through two editions of Charles Joseph Mayer's 1784 French novel, Asgill, ou les d√©sordres des guerres civiles...situating the American Affair, in relation to its French reception, as something of a dramatic Pi√®ce de Th√©√¢tre. By introducing it as a reality- based plot that slides readily from fact into fiction, he illustrates a growing interest in the complex interconnections between 'real life' and 'imaginary conceit' among those affiliated with late eighteenth-century French print culture\\". The Asgill Affair in drama * J.S. le Barbier-le-Jeune, Asgill.: Drama in five acts, prose, dedicated to Lady Asgill, published in London and Paris, 1785. The author shows Washington plagued by the cruel need for reprisal that his duty requires. Washington even takes Asgill in his arms and they embrace with enthusiasm. Lady Asgill was very impressed by the play, and, indeed, Washington himself wrote to thank the author for writing such a complimentary piece, although confessed that his French was not up to being able to read it.

His background is unclear, perhaps coming from a burgess family of Stirling; he emerges in 1228 as the newly elected Bishop of Aberdeen, succeeding the recently deceased Adam de Kalder, after Matthew the Scot had turned down his own election in order to become Bishop of Dunkeld. Most of the knowledge historians have about Bishop Gilbert's episcopate relates to various legal agreements made with other religious institutions, including confirmations of grants made to St Andrews Cathedral Priory and the C√©li D√© of Monymusk, the latter made by Donnchadh, Earl of Mar. He also settled a dispute with the Bishop of Moray regarding certain rights in boundary churches. He died at Aberdeen in 1239. References * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J.

It gives its name to the village of Grasmere, famously associated with the poet William Wordsworth, which lies immediately to the north of the lake.Parker, 2004, pages 34-36 The lake is 1680 yd (1540 m) long and 700 yd (640 m) wide, covering an area of 0.24 mi¬≤ (0.62 km¬≤). It has a maximum depth of 70 ft (21m) and an elevation above sea level of 208 ft (62 m). The lake is both fed and drained by the River Rothay, which flows through the village before entering the lake, and then exits downstream into nearby Rydal Water, beyond which it continues into Windermere.Parker, 2004, page 90 The waters of the lake are leased by the Lowther Estate to the National Trust. The waters are navigable, with private boats allowed and rowing boats for hire, but powered boats are prohibited. The lake contains a single island, known as Grasmere Island or simply The Island. In 2017 this island was bequeathed to the National Trust. This gift has particular significance to the National Trust, as the organisation was founded in response to the sale of the same island to a private bidder in 1893. Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley felt that such a location should instead be in public ownership, and soon afterwards started the National Trust with Octavia Hill and Robert Hunter.

Born in New Delhi, India, Kapoor moved to London at the age of 4. Kapoor was one of the key people behind the Anokha music nights of the mid 1990s alongside its host Talvin Singh and resident DJ-music producer Sam Zaman aka State of Bengal. Anokha, the weekly Monday night music sessions at the venue Blue Note in London's East End, soon became one of city's influential cultural hot spots, drawing a wide variety of musicians, creative artists, tastemakers, and listeners alike. It was instrumental in the rise of what became known globally as The Asian Underground movement. Dubbed ‚ÄòQueen of the Asian Underground‚Äô, Kapoor is featured in veteran music journalist Nik Cohn's book Yes We Have No: Adventures in the Other England. Talvin Singh subsequently won the Mercury Music Prize for his solo album OK in 1999, while State of Bengal signed to Bjork's label One Little Indian, and opened for her world tour. In 1998, Kapoor was the first to bring the sounds of the Asian Underground to India. She produced a series of gigs in Mumbai titled Underground Connected, featuring music producer-DJ State of Bengal, often referred to as God-Father of Asian Break Beat, singer Amar, and drummer Marque Gilmore aka Inna.Most, who is credited as being the man responsible for bringing the complex programmed drum n bass sounds into live performances. These events not only introduced the British Asian underground cultural scene into Mumbai but brought with it global electronic music, fashion and culture trends,influencing many musicians, DJs, filmmakers, designers and other creative artists. Its influence has persisted: drum and bass sounds are heard globally in a variety of genres, as well as in Bollywood songs. Kapoor was also noted for her dress sense in the East End music and cultural circuit. A portrait of Kapoor by Steven Cook and an outfit worn by her were part of the 2004 exhibition The London Look: From Street to Catwalk at The Museum of London, and are now housed as part of its permanent collection under Asian Underground, alongside other pieces from alternative movements including Ms. DYNAMITE, club promoter and performance artist Leigh Bowery and key figures from punk scene. She was also behind bringing BBC Radio One, and its DJ- presenters Nihal and Bobby Friktion into India in a four-city tour, working alongside the British council, with coverage by The Independent newspaper UK.

Norman Tyrell Banks, MBE (12 October 1905 ‚Äì 15 September 1985) was a pioneering radio broadcaster of Australian rules football in Melbourne for over 50 years from the 1930s. Banks is also famous as the founder of Carols by Candlelight. In later years, he was known for his strongly conservative viewpoint on talkback radio.  Early life  Banks was born at Sandringham, Victoria on 12 October 1905. Banks studied for nine years for the Anglican priesthood, first at St Aidan's Theological College, Ballarat, and then at Ridley College, Melbourne. At age 24, he decided he could not proceed as a priest, and went to work as a car salesman and married Lorna May Gilmore. He then had four children: John, Beverley, Felicity and Rodney. Banks had an interest in public speaking, drama and the creative arts, and the emerging medium of radio soon provided an ideal opportunity to display those interests. Radio career: 3KZ  Norman Banks started at 3KZ (now 3KKZ or Gold 104.3 FM) on a salary of four pounds a week in December 1930, but within a month his instant success had seen his wages rise to eight pounds a week. Over the next 20 years, Banks was a leading figure in broadcasting in Melbourne, initiating programs such as Voice of the Voyager, Voice of the People, Voice of the Business Girl, Voice of the Shopper, Husbands and Wives, Junior Information, Spelling Bee, Victoree Varieties, Myer Musicale plus \\"OBs\\" (outside broadcasts) of football, tennis, athletics, swimming and other events. Although not the first to broadcast VFL football (Melbourne's 3AR was broadcasting ex-Carlton player Rod McGregor's descriptions of play at least as early as 1927), Banks was certainly a pioneer of football radio broadcasts, often overcoming extraordinary working conditions. At Princes Park, Carlton in 1931 he broadcast his first football match standing on a ladder at the end of the dressing room. On another occasion at Princes Park he had the luxury of broadcasting from a hardwood plank protruding from a ladies toilet, with no protection from the weather. At Lakeside Oval he broadcast from an 18-metre steel tower. One of Banks‚Äô notable broadcasts was on VE Day 1945 to celebrate the end of World War II. Banks broadcast continuously from the Manchester Unity building, opposite the Melbourne Town Hall at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets.  Carols by Candlelight  On Christmas Eve 1937 Banks saw a woman listening to carols alone by the light of a candle. The image prompted him to try to organise a community event to overcome what to many people was a lonely time of the year. With much effort Banks overcame sceptics and difficulties to stage the first Carols by Candlelight in 1938. On that first night 10,000 people gathered at midnight in the Alexandra Gardens to sing carols with a 30 strong choir, two soloists and the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Band. Since then the event has grown dramatically to become a tradition the world over and is often a fundraiser for charitable purposes. In Melbourne it is a fundraiser for Vision Australia.  Move to 3AW  Banks applied to 3KZ management in 1952 to be allowed leave to attend the Helsinki Olympics. Banks told the station boss that if he was not allowed to go then he would resign. His resignation was accepted on the spot. Within a matter of days he had signed with the rival station 3AW at about double the salary he was getting at 3KZ‚Äîwhat was described as a \\"five-figure sum\\". And he was allowed to go to the Helsinki Olympic Games (indeed he published his notes as The world in my diary; from Melbourne to Helsinki for the Olympic Games in 1953). At 3AW he covered the Olympics, football, current affairs, outside broadcasts around Melbourne and in-studio programs as well. He became effectively the station's News Editor for a time. He was an agile broadcaster, with a fast-thinking brain to boot. He worked at 3AW until 1978, a 26-year career. Although Barry Jones was actually the first to talk to people live on air in Australia, Banks pioneered talk back radio in 1960. Banks became well known on radio in the 1960s and 1970s for his strongly conservative viewpoint, including a strident defence of apartheid in South Africa, and the monarchy. These views were often played out on air in debate with the radical journalist Claudia Wright or the broadcaster Ormsby Wilkins, who called him \\"a sanctimonious old hypocrite\\". Furthermore, despite his moral conservatism and appeal to the traditional Anglo middle class, his own personal relationships were subject to press speculation. Nevertheless, he had a very large radio following. An accident at the football, followed by another in the 3AW corridors, severely reduced his vision (bringing to an end his legendary football descriptions); his vision was so impaired that he qualified for the Australian Government's free of income and assets test Blind Pension. His final on-air words were \\"the humble people, the little people . . . for your trust, loyalty and support\\".  Honours  Banks was made an MBE for his services to broadcasting. He was inducted to the Melbourne Cricket Ground's Rogues Gallery in 1998, with his citation reading‚Äî :An original football caller with 3KZ in 1931, he later moved to 3AW, combining sport and current affairs. (He) Called football for three decades. (He) Covered Helsinki and Melbourne Olympics. In 1996 Banks was an inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in the Media category. His citation read‚Äî :A pioneer of football broadcasts on 3AW and 3KZ. In 1931, (he) broadcast his first match from Princes Park standing on a ladder at the end of the dressing rooms. (His) Broadcasting career spanned 60 years.

It has an early nineteenth-century front facade, but includes some earlier fabric. The hall is Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England and its gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The terraces to the south of the hall and the barns and stables to the north and east are listed Grade II*. The summerhouse, game larder, and ice house in the grounds of the hall are all individually Grade II* listed. The bridge over Rydal Beck is listed Grade II*. History The house was built as the country seat of the Le Fleming baronets, and was sold with its gardens to the Diocese of Carlisle in 1970. The estate remained in the ownership of the Le Fleming family as of 1997. The house plays host to retreats, conferences and courses, and holiday accommodation. There is also the Old School Room Tea Shop, located on the \\"Coffin Route\\" footpath, which leads to Grasmere.  Gardens  \\"The Grot\\" at Rydal Falls The gardens are open to the public. In the mid-17th century, Sir Daniel Fleming (1633‚Äì1701) developed the landscape as an early Picturesque garden incorporating Rydal Beck and its natural waterfalls. 'The Grot' (a summerhouse designed for viewing a waterfall) became a major attraction for a succession of visiting artists and writers in the 18th and 19th century. The formal gardens in front of the house were designed in 1909 by the garden designer and landscape architect Thomas Hayton Mawson (1861‚Äì1933).Rydal Hall Gardens Mawson's Italiate terraces are listed Grade II*. These formal gardens were restored in 2005-7 by Tom Attwood. A community vegetable garden was created at the same time.Mawson Gardens Rydal Hall, Heritage and History. =The gardens and Wordsworth= \\"The Grot\\" at Rydal Falls is described in William Wordsworth's early poem, \\"An Evening Walk\\", published in 1793. The poet moved to Rydal Mount, near Rydal Hall, in 1813 and it remained his home to his death in 1850. Towards the end of the poet's life his nephew Christopher Wordsworth went with him to \\"The Grot\\". The following is a description of their walk together from Rydal Mount. Rydal Hall participates annually in \\"Wordsworth's Daffodil Legacy\\", an initiative of the National Gardens Scheme, as does the National Trust property Dora's Field. This is a special opening to raise monies for charity: normally visitors are invited to make a donation to the upkeep of the gardens.

coast and interior of Western Australia. This taxonomic name includes the widespread type known as western bearded dragon, Pogona minor minor which is widespread across West Australia between the Pilbara and the south coast, and the subspecies, Pogona minor minima is confined to the Wallabi Group of islands. There is another subspecies, Pogona minor mitchelli which lives in tropical woodlands of the Kimberley area of West Australia. Description Pogona minor minor lizards are large, 38 cm in length (15 cm from snout to vent), P. m. minima is slightly smaller, at 11cm snout to vent, and P. m. mitchelli has a snout to vent length of 16cm. All bearded dragons have a chameleon-like colour, either blending into their environments or presenting brighter displays during interaction with others. They are similar in appearance to Pogona nullarbor and Caimanops amphiboluroides (mulga dragon), but are distinguished by smaller heads, and the arrangement of spines on their undersides and necks. The western bearded dragon is widespread in Southwest Australia and central deserts; the range includes semiarid regions such as woodland or heathland, and arid desert or coastal dunes. This subspecies also occurs on Dirk Hartog Island. Pogona minor minima is found on West, North, and East Wallabi Islands, Houtman Abrolhos. These dragons display a behavior common to other Pogona species, they will wave one of their fore legs to trigger a response from a potential rival or mate. Another typical behavior is head-bobbing amongst males, perhaps related to dominance within their social order. They are often seen basking on fence posts. They usually lay egg clutches of 5-9, though clutches of up to 15 have been recorded. Due to their small size, it is likely that they are insectivorous rather than herbivorous like most other bearded dragon species.

At the 2016 census it had a permanent resident population of 814. This is an increase of 125 from the 2011 census. Though the number swells to 7,000 during the Easter and Christmas holidays. History Before European settlement, the area was used for hunting and fishing (men's work), and the collection of water yams and other vegetable food (women's work). Some of their descendants still live in regional townships. Aboriginal middens are still present. In the 19th century British settlers cleared the land and began farming. Sandy soils dominate the flat coastal heath scrubland, which is surrounded by brackish lakes on the north and Bass Strait on the south. Later in the 19th century Melburnians discovered the recreational potential of the lakes‚Äîfishing, swimming and boating‚Äîand by the beginning of the 20th century Loch Sport was accessible via a dirt track, with plots of land surveyed for the nascent township. With increasing use of private cars, more people bought property in the town which, in 1980, was one of the last Victorian towns to receive electricity. Facilities Loch Sport has a primary school, a bowls and tennis club, a caravan park, a marina, a pub, RSL club, boat club, service station with 24/7 fuel, post office and general store, hardware and garden centre, bakery, police station and supermarket, newly built in 2019.

He replaced Vincent Hogg as chief executive in 2005. Hogg‚Äôs departure came against the background of the player standoffs, with the senior and mostly white players taking the board to task over issues of administration. Joining the organization at a tumultuous time, Bvute‚Äôs overriding mandate would be to integrate cricket into a truly national sport. He was Chairman of the Integration Task Force that was set up in 2001 to develop a comprehensive plan that ensures full and equitable nationwide integration of Zimbabwean cricket in the shortest possible time with the least possible reduction in individual and team performance. Many of the measures taken by the integration committee were misunderstood to be the introduction of a quota system and culminated in 15 players resigning from the national team saying that the selection process was unfair. Despite this disruption, under Bvute, Zimbabwe continued to field a national team and fulfill its International Cricket Council obligations as one of the 10 full members of the organization. In 2006, together with Peter Chingoka, the Chairman of Zimbabwe Cricket, Bvute lobbied for the voluntary temporary withdrawal of Zimbabwe from playing Test cricket. Until such a time as the senior players had gained enough experience in playing the longer version, the senior men's team would concentrate on fulfilling its ODI obligations under the ICC Future Tours Programme.

The club currently plays in Victorian State League Division 2. History Founded by two Dutch men, They formed a Dutch team with the name Mooroolbark United Soccer Club in 1962,Club History, TheBarkers.com.au Mooroolbark's backing changed to a British influenced club in its formative years. In 1978 the United tagline was dropped from the name. The Early Years 1964‚Äì1969 The club's first full season in the Victorian Metropolitan League 4th Division saw it finish 9th. The following years would see the club improve its season finishes, finishing 7th (1965), 6th (1966), 5th (1967), 3rd (1968), before winning the Victorian Metropolitan League 4th Division title in 1969. This was a great year for the club as it secured both the Seniors and Reserves title and was the beginning of a huge rise up the footballing ranks. Promotion Through 5 Divisions In 7 Years 1970‚Äì1977 1970 saw the club play in the Victorian Metropolitan League 3rd Division, winning both the Seniors and Reserves titles and securing promotion to the Victorian Metropolitan League 2nd Division at its first attempt. The club finished Runners Up in 1971 to Green Gully Ajax and in 1972 finished 8th in its first season in the Victorian Metropolitan League 1st Division. It only took one more year for the club to win the Victorian Metropolitan League 1st Division title, upon doing so earning promotion to Victoria's highest League at the time ‚Äì the Victorian State League. The club's first season at this level was poor, winning 5 and drawing 7 of its 22 matches and finishing 11th however avoiding relegation. 1975 was a better season with the club finishing on the same points as 2nd-placed South Melbourne Hellas. 1976 was also a strong year for the club, again finishing 3rd in the Victorian State League behind South Melbourne (1st) and Footscray JUST (2nd). Rise To The NSL 1977 The club's claim to fame is as Victoria's (and Australia's) first national sporting club side. Mooroolbark enabled the National Soccer League to proceed, breaking the deadlock which was then in force between the budding National League and clubs from Victoria, whom the Victorian Soccer Federation had forbidden to join the competition. When Mooroolbark joined the NSL, officially as its first entrant, soon three other Victorian clubs, South Melbourne, Heidelberg United and Footscray JUST also joined, enabling the competition to go ahead.Hay, 2006, The World Game Downunder, pp 121‚Äì122 Mooroolbark's stay in the NSL however, was short-lived. Under manager and former player Brian Edgley, the club finished in last place and was demoted back to the Victorian Leagues, but not to the Victorian State League, which it had been a member of from 1974‚Äì76, but to the equivalent of a 3rd Division. As part of the requirements for all Victorian NSL clubs in 1977, they had to field a reserve side in the Victorian 2nd Division. Mooroolbark finished in a relegation spot and upon their return to Victorian competition the Victorian Soccer Federation saw fit that Mooroolbark should commence 1978 in the Victorian Metropolitan League 3rd Division (today's Victorian State League 3rd Division). Slide To The Provisional Leagues 1978‚Äì1981 Three relegations in four years saw the club sink to the Provisional Leagues, finishing 10th in the Victorian Metropolitan League 3rd Division in 1978 and 12th in 1979 (earning relegation) and finishing 11th in the Victorian Metropolitan League 4th Division in 1980 (again earning relegation). 1981 was the first time in its history that Mooroolbark had visited the Provisional Leagues however it was only a one-season stay as the club earned promotion back to the Victorian Metropolitan League 4th Division the following year. Battle Back To The Premier League 1982‚Äì1991 The next few years were a real battle for the club, however the hard work began to pay off. After spending the next four years in the Victorian Metropolitan League 4th Division (later re-structuring to become the Victorian Metropolitan League 3rd Division), the club ended up finishing 9th in both 1982 and 1983, 10th in 1984, 8th in 1985 before winning the Victorian Metropolitan League 3rd Division title with 17 wins and 6 draws from their 26 matches. Their 1987 revisit to the Victorian Metropolitan League 2nd Division was a short one, gaining promotion that very year by finishing Runners Up to Westgate and missing the title by 1 point. The club's 1988 Victorian League 1st Division campaign was strong but missing out on promotion, finishing 3rd, however it was the club's title-winning 1989 Victorian League 1st Division season which saw the club back into the State's elite League ‚Äì the Victorian State League. The club's first foray in the Victorian State League for 14 years saw an average season, finishing mid-table with 13 wins, 7 draws and 14 losses from their 34 games. The 1991 season saw the Victorian State League renamed the Victorian Premier League however name- change or no name-change this would still see an end Mooroolbark's two-year stint in Victoria's top League, finishing 12th and earning relegation back to the newly named Victorian State League 1st Division. Slide To The Provisional Leagues: Part 2 1992‚Äì2001 Mooroolbark's entry back into the Victorian State League 1st Division was short-lived, finishing 13th and earning relegation. The next 6 years would see Mooroolbark struggling in Victorian State League 2nd Division, finishing 12th in 1993, 11th in 1994, 10th in 1995, 13th in 1996, 6th in 1997 before a lowly 14th position in 1998 would see Mooroolbark slip further down the State Leagues ranks. The club would only have a two-season stay in the Victorian State League 3rd Division, finishing 10th in 1999 and 12th in 2000 (earning relegation). Each State & Provisional League would also now be split into two divisions based on geographical location: North-West and South East (i.e. Victorian Provisional 1st Division North-West and Victorian Provisional 1st Division South-East). Down, But Not Without A Fight 2001 would be only the 2nd year in the club's 39-year history that it would have played in the Provisional Leagues. The club finished 3rd in 2001, 3rd in 2002 and finally gained promotion back to the Victorian State 3rd Division South-East in 2003, finishing Runners Up to Chelsea Hajduk. 2004 would see the club finish a respectable 5th whilst 2005 would see the club go oh-so-close to promotion back to the Victorian State 2nd Division South-East, but missed out finishing 3rd behind Waverley Wanderers (1st) and Clayton (2nd). 2006 would see the club finish 8th however it was 2007 when the club finished 12th which would see them back to the Victorian Provisional 1st Division South-East League. The club's finishing positions over the last few years have been 8th (2008), 6th (2009), 6th (2010), 6th (2011) and 5th (2012), narrowly missing out on promotion by 2 points. Rapid rise to State 1 2013 was the club's breakthrough year, winning both the Senior Men's and Reserve Men's Championships. Due to a league re-structure, Mooroolbark was promoted to State 2, effectively skipping State 3. Not to be overawed, a solid 4th place finish in 2014 surprised many in the league. Season 2015 season got off to a rocky start with the Barkers finding themselves in 7th position after 9 rounds. Their fortunes changed with the inspirational signing of right-back George Aratzis from local rivals Knox City, which sparked a 12 game unbeaten run which secured promotion to State 1 in the penultimate round of the season. This was courtesy of a 2-1 win thanks to a dramtica 93rd minute goal from David Brickell. 2015 Promotion Squad =First-team squad= The Great Escape The magic of their run to State 1 had looked like it had run out for the Barkers in season 2016, and were certainties to be relegated. After 13 rounds, they were rock bottom of the ladder with only 4 points, having only scored 13 goals (least in the league) and conceding 42 (most in the league). 4 wins out of their next 7 games pushed them out of the relegation zone, and needing only 1 point from their last 2 games to survive. Their 2nd last game of the season was against league leaders Mornington. Mornington needed a win to secure the Championship. With the scores locked at 1-1 in the 96th minute, Mornington scored a goal to send the huge crowd wild. Their celebrations were almost short lived as Mooroolbark went down the other end from kick-off and a 98th minute header from Maxim Solovyev struck the crossbar, in which would have kept the Barkers up if it had gone in.

Bohtan (also Buhtan, Bokhti) was a medieval Kurdish principality in the Ottoman Empire centered on the town of Jazirah ibn 'Omar (modern Cizre also known as Ciz√Æra Botan (Jazira Botan)) in southeastern Anatolia. Bohtanis were an ancient and prominent branch of the Kurds that claimed descent from the Islamic General and Sahaba Khalid ibn al-Walid. Some minor branches followed Yazidism but Sunni Islam predominated in the 14th century.Nelida Fuccaro, The other Kurds: Yazidis in colonial Iraq, 256 pp., Palgrave Macmillan, 1999. (see p.10) History In the early 8th century Bukhtis and Bajnawi Kurds ruled the area surrounding Sinjar and Jazira mountains known under name Zozan by Arab geographers. Yaqoot Hamawi describes their residing area to be from Ikhlat to Salmas which included many strongholds belonging to Bokhtis; he also mentioned town of Jardhakil as their capital. The principality ruled over an area extending from Diyarbakir to Van and from Rawanduz to Sinjar at its peak. The first governors of Bohtan, were from the Azizoƒülu family, who were related to the Governors of the Principality of Bitlis. In the 16th century, Bohtan was granted the status of a H√ºk√ºmet, and it became a hereditary Kurdish principality within Ottoman Empire. An important governor of the Bohtan was Bedir Khan Bey, who succeeded Mir Sevdin.Henning, Barbara (2018),p.95 Bedir Khan Bey was M√Ær of the principality in 1835 and again in 1847. Bedir Khan Bey resigned after an unsuccessful uprising against the Ottoman Empire and following lost its independence Sub-groups The main branches of Bukhtis were Brasbi, Dasni and Sindi. According to Sharafkhan Bidlisi in his time few Bukhtis followed Yazidi faith, furthermore he states that previously Bukhtis were among the Kurdish groups who had a large Yazidi branch.Keo - Religion See also * List of Kurdish dynasties and countries * Yazidis References External links *Encyclopaedia Islamica (in Persian) Former Kurdish states in Turkey Kurdish dynasties History of ≈ûƒ±rnak Province ","title":"Bohtan"},{"id":"9710174","text":"Spatial interaction in Dhaka Transport geography, also transportation geography, is a branch of geography that investigates the movement and connections between people, goods and information on the Earth's surface. Aims and scope Transportation geography detects, describes, and explains the Earth's surface's transportation spaces regarding location, substance, form, function, and genesis. It also investigates the effects of transportation on land use, on the physical material patterns at the surface of the earth known as 'cover patterns', and on other spatial processes such as environmental alterations. Moreover, it contributes to transport, urban, and regional planning. Transportation is fundamental to the economic activity of exchange. Therefore, transport geography and economic geography are largely interrelated. At the most basic level, humans move and thus interact with each other by walking, but transportation geography typically studies more complex regional or global systems of transportation that include multiple interconnected modes like public transit, personal cars, bicycles, freight railroads, the Internet, airplanes and more. Such systems are increasingly urban in character. Thus, transport and urban geography are closely intertwined. Cities are very much shaped, indeed created, by the types of exchange and interaction facilitated by movement.Braudel, F. 1949 / 1995 The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Phillip II. Berkeley: University of California Press Increasingly since the 19th century, transportation is seen as a way cities, countries or firms compete with each other in a variety of spaces and contexts.Graham, S., Marvin, S. 2001. Splintering Urbanism: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilities and the Urban Condition: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilites and the Urban Condition. London: Routledge. Transportation modes In terms of transport modes, the primary forms are air, road, water, and rail. Each form has its own cost associated with 'speed of movement', which is affected by friction, place of origin, and destination. Ships are generally used for moving large amounts of goods. Maritime shipping is able to carry more around the world at a cheaper cost. For moving people who prefer to minimize travel time and maximize comfort and convenience, road and air are the most common modes in use. A railroad is often used to transport goods in areas away from water. Railroads may also be the source of transportation for people as well. > \\" Transportation modes are an essential component of transport systems since > they are the means by which mobility is supported. Geographers consider a > wide range of modes that may be grouped into three broad categories based on > the medium they exploit: land, water and air.

Strategic chokepoints around the world have continued to play significant roles in maritime industry. Although the slowest form of transportation compared to road and rail transport, it is the most cost effective. = Rail Transportation = Image provided by Michael G√§bler, artist work shared here to express rail transportation for this page. Rail transportation is the movement of cargo, goods, and passengers on trains as a form of transportation. Transportation by rails has been established as one of the safest modes of transportation over time. Challenges for transportation Seattle traffic at I-5 and Yesler Way Transportation availability on existing streets, highways, and rail facilities no longer match the transportation demands created by subsequent population growth and new location patterns of economic activity. Besides an increase in population, another problem is vehicles overloading the network of highways and arterial streets. See Traffic congestion, Transportation network, and Population densities The well-being of poor people and people who live in developing areas can be threatened by systems of transportation that fail to connect them to jobs and medical assistance. For example, areas of Southern California have transportation systems that do not connect the homeless to these necessities. See Environmental Justice.

All members of the Indo-European language family are subject to some degree of deflexional change. This phenomenon has been especially strong in Western European languages, such as English, French, and others. Deflexion typically involves the loss of some inflectional affixes, notably affecting word endings (markers) that indicate noun cases, verbal tenses and noun classes. This is part of a process of gradual decline of the inflectional morphemes, defined as atomic semantic units bound to abstract word units (lexemes). Complete loss of the original subset of affixes combined with a development towards allomorphy and new morphology is associated in particular with creolization, i.e. the formation of pidgins and creole languages.Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, Elsevier, 2004, Pidgins affix dropping (6:3187)Morphology in pidgins and Creoles, Ingo Plag, University of Siegen, Version of June 28, 2004, Directly related to deflexion is the languages becoming less synthetic and more analytic in nature. However, the ways in which languages undergo deflexion and the results of these developments are by no means uniform. For example, the modern Romance languages all continue to feature a complex verb system, while having strongly deflected their nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. German, on the other hand, has further simplified the already simple Germanic verb system (even radically so in some dialects) but has preserved the three genders and four cases of early Germanic languages. Deflexion is a common feature of the history of many Indo-European languages. According to the Language Contact Hypothesis for Deflexion,What are the factors that cause deflection? In order to answer this question, the Meertens Institute (KNAW) and the Amsterdam Center for Language and Communication (UvA) have started a research program called Variation in Inflection, or simply Variflex. ‚ÄúThe loss of inflectional distinctions and the language contact hypothesis have often been discussed in the literature, but have never been the subject of extensive and integrated research. This is probably due to the need for a complex, multidisciplinary approach. Such a research programme would have to combine theoretical linguistics, diachronic linguistics, dialectology, first language acquisition and second language acquisition.‚Äù (The original Variflex proposal) supported by the comparison between Germanic languagesJ√≥hanna Bar√∞dal, ‚ÄúThe Development of Case in Germanic,‚Äù in Bar√∞dal & Chelliah, eds., The Role of Semantic, Pragmatic & Discourse Factors in the Development of Case, Studies in Language Companion Series, No. 108 (Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2009 [in press]), pp. 123‚Äì160, . (for instance, Icelandic and Afrikaans), this process is attributed to language contact. Specifically, the phenomenon occurs in the presence of large, influential groups of speakers that have acquired the leading idiom as a second language (L2)Weerman, F. (1993), The diachronic consequences of first and second language acquisition and so is limited to economical trade-offs widely considered acceptable. Though gradual, English experienced a dramatic change from Old English, a moderately inflected language using a complex case system, to Modern English, considered a weakly inflected language or even analytic. Important deflexion changes first arrived in the English language with the North Sea Germanic (Ingvaeonic) shifts, shared by Frisian and Low German dialects, such as merging accusative and dative cases into an objective case. Viking invasions and the subsequent Norman conquest accelerated the process. The importance of deflexion in the formative stage of a language can be illustrated by modern Dutch, where deflexion accounts for the overwhelming majority of linguistic changes in the last thousand years or more. Afrikaans originated from Dutch virtually by deflexion. According to the unidirectionality hypothesis,Hopper, Paul J. and Elizabeth Closs Traugott: Grammaticalization, 1993, Cambridge University Press. deflexion should be subject to a semantically driven one-way cline of grammaticality. However, exceptions to the gradual diachronic process have been observed where the deflexion process diminished or came to a halt, or where inflexional case marking was occasionally reinforced. There are also a few cases of reversed directionality, e.g. in the evolution of the common Romance inflected future and conditional (or \\"indicative future-of-the-past\\") from earlier periphrastic suppletive forms for the loss of the corresponding classical Latin tenses.

Events can be varied, including lectures, exhibitions, workshops, live demonstrations of experiments, guided tours, and panel discussions. There may also be events linking science to the arts or history, such as plays, dramatised readings, and musical productions. The core content is that of science and technology, but the style comes from the world of the arts. History The modern concept of a science festival comes from the city of Edinburgh in 1989. The choice of Glasgow as European Capital of Culture for 1990 took Edinburgh by surprise and stimulated it to rebrand itself as a city of science, building on the success of a series of big urban developments led by its Economic Development Department. A senior member of the development team, Ian Wall, proposed that Edinburgh should highlight its new image by complementing its world-famous autumn arts festival with a new type of spring event for which he coined the phrase 'science festival'. Reaction was mixed, with some organisations doubting whether science could be packaged in an arts format. Even so, the city put resources behind the idea, appointing a director and project team, and in April 1989 the first Edinburgh International Science Festival took place. Edinburgh's success led to the development of science festivals in many other parts of the world. The British Science Association restructured its annual meeting, originally established in 1831 as a discussion forum for scientists, to turn it into the British Science Festival of today. The town of Cheltenham‚Äîfamous for its jazz, music, and literature festivals‚Äî added science to its portfolio with the creation of the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2002. As science organizations and funding bodies put ever more emphasis on outreach to foster public understanding both of the results and the wider relevance of science, recent years have seen the creation of a number of new science festivals. An umbrella organization for European science festivals and other science communication events, the European Science Events Association (EUSEA), was formed in 2001 and now has approximately 100 member organizations from 36 different countries. The concept spread to Sweden in 1997 with The International Science Festival in Gothenburg which is an annual festival in central Gothenburg, Sweden with thought provoking science activities for the public. The festival is visited by about each year.vartgoteborg.se - V√§rldsrekordf√∂rs√∂k inleder G√∂teborgs tolfte vetenskapsfestival, V√•rt G√∂teborg, 11 april 2008 This makes it the largest popular science event in Swedengoteborg.com - Festivalens hemsida (archivelink 2006-11-01) and one of the largest popular science events in Europe.Forskning och framsteg, 3/08 sid 64 (dead link 2012-04-24) The spread of science festivals within the United States is relatively recent. One of the earliest examples is Wonderfest, an annual Bay Area science festival that began in 1998. Additionally, the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science includes a number of public events. Focusing on one particular science, the physics festival \\"Mastering the Mysteries of the Universe\\", was held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1999 in association with the centennial of the American Physical Society.; details of the festival programs and speakers can be found here Since 2004, there has been a science festival in Pittsburgh (the SciTech festival; from 2005 on known as the SciTech Spectacular), and new science festivals have been held in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the Cambridge Science Festival, first held in April 2007); and in New York City (the World Science Festival held at the end of May 2008); and in March 2009, San Diego hosted the first west coast science festival, the San Diego Science Festival founded by Larry Bock. the Science Festival Alliance, a consortium of major festivals formed with a 3-year NSF grant, has supported the growth of independent regional science festivals, with an initial emphasis on celebration in communities throughout the US. In September 2010, the North Carolina Science Festival became the first statewide science festival in the United States, presenting more than 400 events across the state over a two-week span. The second NC Science Festival was held April 13‚Äì29, 2012, and the festival is now an annual event. Morehead Planetarium and Science Center at UNC-Chapel Hill founded the North Carolina Science Festival and continues to administer it. In late October 2010, the USA Science and Engineering Festival was the \\"country‚Äôs first national science festival\\". This national emphasis was based partly on encouraging local events to coincide with the major event in Washington DC. Festivals can vary greatly in size and scope. A university might stage a small festival in its hometown. On the other end of the scale, the 2006 British Association Festival of Science held on September 2‚Äì9 in Norwich, England, was attended by more than 174,000 visitors. ; for the attendance, see Typical festival events Science festivals feature a wide variety of events. A typical format for a science festival is to have a series of lectures, with topics ranging from cutting-edge research to unusual perspectives on science. For instance, the 2007 Edinburgh festival \\"Big Ideas\\" series included talks on what makes racing cars fast, the molecular basis of food preparation, the neurobiology of love and beauty, and the properties of quarks. Most science festivals include hands-on activities similar to those found in science centers. Another popular theme is the interaction of science and culture, including the arts. Science festivals are also aimed at playing an important, if informal part in secondary science education. Many have events specifically aimed at students and/or teachers, such as workshops or offering curriculum-linked workshops, and science shows to regional schools throughout the year.

Encrypted sparse image files are used to secure a user's home directory by the FileVault feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and earlier. Sparse images can be created using Disk Utility. Unlike a full image file (), which takes up as much actual space as the real disk it represents (regardless of the amount of unused space), a sparse image file () takes up only as much actual disk space as the data contained within, up to a maximum of the capacity assigned during creation. Limitations Two limitations are therefore worth noting regarding the use of this image file format: # A customized \\".sparseimage\\" image file can be assigned a larger total capacity than the physical volume (or HD partition) on which it originally resides. While the virtual volume will seem to make that capacity available, attempting to exceed the physical capacity of the underlying volume will result in a disk error: \\"ran out of space\\". The file must first be moved to a larger physical disk or partition. # As noted above, while mounted image files automatically expand to their preassigned limit when data is added, they cannot be arbitrarily resized without the use of Disk Utility, , or other such software.  Sparse bundle disk images Mac OS X Leopard introduced the concept of the sparse bundle. Instead of a single big file, a sparse bundle is a bundle (directory) containing a number of files called bands, each on the order of 8 MB in size. This means even though to the end user the sparse bundle appears as a single file, it is composed of smaller files. As of Mac OS X 10.8, the bands are 8 MiB () each. When the content of the image changes, one or more band files is changed, created, or deleted. This allows backup software (such as Time Machine) to operate more efficiently. Sparse bundle advantages for Time Machine: * the backup destination no longer needs to be a Hierarchical File System (HFS) volume (for the hard links to work and to preserve metadata), but can be any shared folder, on any server, connected using any protocol and using any file system to store the actual files * the entire sparse bundle is replicable from one location to another; this is particularly useful when upgrading the backup storage and when the on-site backup storage needs to be replicated to an off-site backup storage. A tool such as rsync may be used to keep one or more disk images consistent across various systems.

Cause Hay fever was relatively uncommon in Japan until the early 1960s. Shortly after World War II, reforestation policies resulted in large forests of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress trees, which were an important resource for the construction industry. As these trees matured, they started to produce large amounts of pollen. Peak production of pollen occurs in trees of 30 years and older.MEDICAL CONSULTATION RATE OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND POLLINOSIS SURVEILLANCE IN AICHI, JAPAN As the Japanese economy developed in the 1970s and 1980s, cheaper imported building materials decreased the demand for cryptomeria and Japanese cypress materials. This resulted in increasing forest density and aging trees, further contributing to pollen production and thus, hay fever. In 1970, about 50% of cryptomeria were more than 10 years old, and just 25% were more than 20 years old. By 2000, almost 85% of cryptomeria were over 20 years old, and more than 60% of trees were over 30 years old. This cryptomeria aging trend has continued since then, and though cryptomeria forest acreage has hardly increased since 1980, pollen production has continued to increase.Yahoo Japan hay fever column 5302 detailing history of postwar cryptomeria forests Furthermore, urbanization of land in Japan led to increasing coverage of soft soil and grass land by concrete and asphalt. Pollen settling on such hard surfaces can easily be swept up again by winds to recirculate and contribute to hay fever. As a result, approximately 25 million people (about 20% of the population) currently suffer from this type of seasonal hay fever in Japan. Pollen season Cryptomeria pollen dispersal starts when average daily temperatures reach 10 degrees Celsius, partly depending on wind and terrain. Like the cherry blossom season, the pollen season moves from south to north across Japan, and from lower to higher elevations as spring progresses. For western and eastern Japan (including Tokyo and the surrounding Kant≈ç region) this means the hay fever season starts between end of January and mid-February. The cryptomeria pollen season peaks in the second half of March - first half of April in these areas, then declining over the following six to eight weeks. Japanese cypress pollination lags cryptomeria by about a month. Some people are more sensitive to one of the two pollen types and therefore may experience allergic symptoms earlier or later than others. Media information Japanese media track and report on the developing pollen season in ways similar to the prediction and tracking of the cherry blossom season. The Japan Weather Association (JWA) and Weathernews Japan particularly collect and provide detailed information on pollen counts in locations across Japan. Besides daily or even hourly information during the pollen season, JWA provides a long term forecast in the fall of the expected severity of the coming season. The amount of flowering and pollen production depends primarily on the weather during the preceding summer, with long hot summers resulting in higher pollen production the following spring. JWA issues this long-term prediction as an indication of the relative severity of the coming pollen season compared to the average of the preceding ten years. Commercial response A sizable industry has developed in Japan around services and products that help people deal with hay fever, including protective wear such as coats with smooth surfaces, masks, and glasses; medication and remedies; household goods such as air-conditioner filters and fine window screens; and even \\"hay fever relief vacations\\" to low-pollen areas such as Okinawa and Hokkaido. Some people in Japan use medical laser therapy to desensitize the parts of their nose that are sensitive to pollen. Government response As the impact of the allergy season on the population has mounted, the Japanese government has increasingly focused attention on the issue. In 1990, the Ministry of Agriculture started a series of annual Hay Fever Conferences to coordinate among government institutions involved. The Liberal Democratic Party (the governing party at the time) submitted a motion on Anti Allergy and Hay Fever Measures in 1995, greatly influenced by increasing lobbying. The government budget for addressing pollen allergies has greatly increased since then. The 2002 budget for hay fever issues was 7,372,000,000 yen, 27 times the amount of seven years earlier. Administrative measures include basic research, improved forecasting and the development of therapies, as well as research to develop low pollen producing cryptomeria and Japanese cypress varieties. However, devastation of the forestry industry and the diminishing number of forestry workers as result of cheap and high quality imports has made actual implementation of measures in forest plantations slow. In 2005, the Forestry Agency announced plans to plant 600,000 low pollen- producing cryptomeria trees over the following five years. Nonetheless, cryptomeria forests in Japan cover a total of 45,300 square kilometres so a meaningful migration to such varieties proves to be a considerable challenge.

The purpose of the Cape May Bird Observatory is to conduct research, encourage conservation, and organize educational and recreational birding activities. It consists of two separate centers: the Center for Research and Education near Cape May Court House in the central part of Cape May County, and the Northwood Center in Cape May Point. Bird migration Cape May is at a crossroads for bird migration. Every spring and fall, thousands of migrating birds pass through the area. Subsequently, birders from all over the world have flocked to Cape May to witness the migrations. Ecotourism Former Cape May Bird Observatory Director Paul Kerlinger published landmark studies on ecotourism in the 1990s, showing the impact of ecotourism dollars on Cape May and several other tourist areas with wildlife refuges. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service honored his work with a special citation by then director Molly Beattie. The Cape May Bird Observatory, as part of the New Jersey Audubon Society, also helps to organize the World Series of Birding each May. The World Series, as well as other birding festivals, such as the Cape May Fall Weekend, bring hundreds of people to the Cape May area, who enjoy its rich avifauna and support the local economy. Authors The Cape May area is home to many birding authors, including Dunne, Kerlinger, Pat and Clay Sutton, Michael O'Brien, Richard Crossley and Kevin Karlson. Author David Allen Sibley was also a Cape May birder. Sibley wrote his classic field guide, The Sibley Guide to Birds, while he was living and birding in Cape May Point.

The Maltese name of ƒ¶add in-Nies, People's Sunday, is an indication of the large number of visitors who used to go to ≈ªabbar to render thanks and pray at the feet of Our Lady. For many centuries, people from all walks of life, locals and foreigners, participated. On 6 March 1927, Archbishop Dom Mauro Caruana OSB participated in the renewed religious celebration of People's Sunday; today Archbishop Charles Scicluna is visiting the ≈ªabbar Sanctuary of Our Lady of Graces, to meet the clergy, and above all participate in the pilgrimage of People's Sunday. Evidence of the earliest devotion to Our Lady of Graces came to light in 1954 with the discovery of a late 15th-century fresco in the early Melitan-style chapel of St Domenica in ≈ªabbar. The earliest surviving 16th century reports by Bishops give us an insight into the devotion to Our Lady. The fragmentary report of 1570 by Mgr Antonio Bartolo, Vicar General sede vacante, just five years after the Siege of Malta (1565), gives us a further indication of the popularity of this devotion. The four-page inventory of the furnishings of Our Lady of Graces Chapel shows us a number of richly woven sacred vestments, silver necklaces, precious ornaments together with humble altar cloths. This clearly indicates that both rich and poor flocked to this sacred spot. This is, again, fully supported by the report of Apostolic Delegate Pietro Dusina of 1575. His description of churches and chapels in Malta and Gozo incidentally shows that the ≈ªabbar Our Lady of Graces chapel was the only one under this title on the Islands. This was a factor that surely helped to attract more people. A hundred years had to pass before another chapel was dedicated to Our Lady of Graces, which was built at ƒ¶al Missilment in Naxxar, Malta. Msgr Dusina was very impressed by the great attachment of people to the ≈ªabbar chapel. He wrote that many pilgrims from various towns and villages went there to implore favours or render thanks for benefits received, leaving behind offerings of all sorts, which eventually covered all the walls of this chapel. Most of these pilgrims went every Wednesday all the year around. Two or three Masses were said on these days to meet the visitor demand. This was not so common elsewhere in those times, where only one Mass was celebrated annually on the patron saint's feast day. To cater for these pilgrims, Msgr Dusina appointed Fr Antonio De Nicolaci as rector of this chapel \\"to foster and strengthen this holy devotion among the people.\\" The practice of going on a pilgrimage as a sign of penance and a closer approach to God goes back to the early centuries of the Christian Church. In Rome, the faithful assembled at an agreed church station and followed the Pope or a Church dignitary to another station chapel. They recited prayers and chanted the penitential psalms all along the route. By 1585, the ≈ªabbar chapel proved too small to accommodate the ever increasing number of pilgrims. Grand Master Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle helped to extend the church and donated a new titular painting. At the same time, Pope Sixtus V granted 100 days of Indulgence to all visitors. In 1636, just 20 years after the chapel had been elevated into a parish before splitting with ≈ªejtun, Bishop Michaele Belageur described the large quantity of ex-voto offerings, and stated that of all the churches on the islands, this one attracts the greatest devotion: devotissima est. Similar comments were made even by later bishops when they visited ≈ªabbar. A typical remark is that made by Bishop Alpheran de Bussan (1728-1757), who in his 1737 visit states: \\"From olden times a large number of people converged to this church of Our Lady of Graces to offer thanks for the miraculous favours received. \\"The people offered gifts to fulfill vows, leaving behind small paintings, chains, weapons and all kinds of trophies of war as a sign of gratitude to God and Holy Mary. One every Wednesday and especially on Ash Wednesday, the number of these pilgrims from cities, towns and villages is even greater.\\" The inventories of this church, especially those of 1679 and 1699, list many of these donations. Social gathering In the meantime, Carnival celebrations were becoming more organised. Thus a new aspect was added to these Lenten pilgrimages. Those who might have misbehaved or somehow gone beyond their Christian duties during Carnival, felt they could show repentance by taking part in these pilgrimages. Ash Wednesday, being a normal working day with abstinence and fasting, proved inconvenient for many. The crowds preferred to satisfy their obligations on the following Sunday, the first of Lent. During the following century, this change seemed to have been well established. In fact, George Percy Badger, who was in Malta in 1838 stated that it was still practised on Ash Wednesday. However, an updated edition of 1858 states that the pilgrimage took place on Palm Sunday (ƒ¶add in-Nies).

It was fought on at Cowan's ford on the Catawba River in northwestern Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, between a force of about 5,000 British and fewer than a thousand Americans who were attempting to slow the British advance across the river. The American general William Lee Davidson was killed in this battle. Background After the British victory at the Battle of Camden, General Nathanael Greene replaced Horatio Gates as Commander of the Southern Department of the Continental Army. Rather than attempt to confront the much larger and better equipped British Army under Cornwallis directly, Greene attempted to wear down his opponents by engaging the British in a series of small battles. Of these battles, Greene stated of the Continental Army: \\"We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.\\" Following the Battle of Cowpens, Cornwallis was determined on destroying Greene's forces. Cornwallis ordered his men to burn their supplies and pursued Greene in the \\"Race to the Dan\\" (The Dan River which flows through Southern Virginia and Northern North Carolina). During the preceding weeks, Cornwallis's army had swung to the left and approached the swollen waters of the Catawba in late January. For three days, the British forces camped at Ramsour's Mill, where they were joined by the remains of Banastre Tarleton forces. On , General Daniel Morgan reported to General Nathanael Greene from his camp in Sherrills Ford that his forces had observed the British army moving towards the Catawba River. Morgan reported that he was attempting to collect the militia and delay Cornwallis's forces from crossing the river. To this end, Morgan ordered General William Lee Davidson with 500 militia (two hundred and fifty of which were without flints for their muskets) to Beatties Ford.Letter From Daniel Morgan, Papers of General Nathanael Greene, Camp at Sherels Ford Catawba River [N.C.] January 28, 1781 ,University of North Carolina Press, 1994 Cornwallis marched his forces eastward toward the river to Jacob Forney's, where they camped for another three days after he had determined that the Catawba river at Beatties Ford was impassable because of the raging current. Battle On , Cornwallis began to move his army despite the heavy rain fearing any further delay would cause him to lose his chance of destroying Greene's army. Some six weeks after the engagement, Cornwallis wrote that he had ordered a detachment under Lieutenant Colonel Webster to \\"make every possible demonstration by cannonading and otherwise, of an intention to force a passage\\" at Beatties Ford while he would march down the river to Cowan's Ford. General Greene arrived and ordered General Davidson, who had placed his men at the various fords along the eastern bank, to slow the British Army's crossing of the Catawba River. Greene and Morgan then left to accompany the bulk of their forces towards Salisbury, North Carolina. Davidson dispatched a company of cavalry and infantry southward four miles to Cowan's Ford. The cavalry was to see that the British did not make a surprise crossing under cover of darkness. Toward nightfall Davidson joined the detachment at Cowan's Ford. Davidson evidently feared that Tarleton's troops might slip across the river in the darkness and, getting behind him, they could attack him as the British infantry began its crossing. He therefore set up camp a half mile from the river, with pickets watching Cowan's Ford from the water's edge. Near daybreak, after a difficult march in which the British lost some of their cannon, Cornwallis's army reached Cowan's Ford. Cowan's Ford was actually two fords; one, the horse ford, though shallower than the other, was longer, because it crossed the stream at an angle; the other, called the wagon ford, went straight across the river but was much deeper. With very little hesitation, the British began crossing the swollen stream straight across along the wagon ford. Soon the horses were over their heads in the raging torrent. Davidson's forces immediately began to confront the Redcoats. The militiamen were picking off many British soldiers as they struggled in the water to reach the far bank. After the first elements reached the bank and formed a firing line, they began to fire a volley at the now retreating militia. Shortly after arriving on the scene, Davidson was struck from his horse by a rifle ball through the heart. Oral tradition has it that a local Tory guide fired the fatal shot.Stonestreet, O.C. IV, The Battle of Cowan's Ford: General Davidson's Stand on the Catawba River and its place in North Carolina History,(Createspace Publishing, 2012) .p.17 Late that evening Davidson's naked body was found. His corpse was evidently robbed by British soldiers, a fact established on when his wallet was brought back from England where it had been held in the Public Records Office in London since the Revolution. General Davidson is buried at Hopewell Church in Mecklenburg county, NC.

Normally, the karate practitioner undergoing the test will have to face similarly or higher-ranked opponents, and may face an opponent a few times in the course of the test (depending on the number of opponents available to participate).

The short story was also adapted into a film of the same title. Plot summary The narrative deals with the problems of Parvez, who has migrated to England with his son Ali. Parvez worries because Ali's behaviour has changed significantly. Early in the story, Parvez is afraid of discussing his worries with his friends because his son has always been a kind of showpiece son. Eventually, Parvez breaks his silence and tells them how his son has changed, hoping to receive some advice. After having a short conversation, they come to the conclusion that his son might be addicted to drugs and that he sells his things to earn money to buy drugs. After this meeting, Parvez goes to his taxi to drive home. But in his car he finds Bettina, a prostitute, who drives with Parvez very often and has become a confidante. Since Parvez has defended Bettina from a client who had attacked her, they take care of each other. Parvez tells Bettina what he has observed and that he and his friends assume that his son does all these strange things because he is drug addicted. Bettina instructs Parvez on how he has to observe his son to find out if there is anything physically wrong with him. However, after a few days of observations Parvez decides that his son appears totally healthy. The only physical change Parvez observes is that Ali is growing a beard. And it turns out that his son does not sell his things. He just gives them away. Parvez notices that Ali prays five times a day, although he had not been brought up to be religious. Parvez decides to invite his son to dinner to talk to him about his recent behaviour. Initially, Ali refuses this invitation, but later he accepts it. Parvez drinks a lot during this meeting and they start to argue. Ali criticises his father's way of life because in his opinion his father is \\"too implicated in Western civilization\\" (Kureishi 2001: 157) and breaks the Pakistani rules by drinking alcohol and eating pork. Ali tells his father that he is going to give up his studies because, from his point of view, \\"Western education cultivates an anti-religious attitude\\". Parvez feels he has lost his son and wants to tell him to leave the house. But Bettina changes his mind and Parvez resolves to try to understand what is going on in his son's mind. During the next days Parvez tries to explain cautiously to his son what his ideas and attitudes towards life are. He even grows a beard to please Ali. But Ali still holds his father in contempt for not following the rules of the Qur'an. A few days later while Parvez is driving in his taxi with Bettina he sees his son walking down the sidewalk. Parvez asks Ali to come in and drive with them. In the car, Bettina starts to have a conversation with Ali, but as she tries to explain to Ali that his father loves him very much, Ali becomes angry and offends Bettina. Afterwards he wants to escape from the car, but Bettina prevents him. She leaves the car when it is still moving and runs away. Back at home Parvez drinks a lot of alcohol because he is furious at his son. He walks into Ali's room and attacks his son who does not show any kind of reaction to protect or defend himself. When Parvez stops hitting him, Ali asks his father: \\"So who's the fanatic now?\\"  The Short Story in Comparison to the Film  The film differs significantly from the short story. The order of events is changed and new events and characters are added. Even the name Ali is changed to Farid. The short story is set in London, South East of England, and the film is set in Bradford which lies in Northern England. The new characters in the film are \\"the maulvi from Lahore, Fizzie and Herr Schitz.\\" (Moore- Gilbert 2001: 164) Another important invention of the film is the change of the relationship between Parvez and Bettina. In the short story it is mentioned that Bettina and Parvez take \\"care for each other\\" (Kureishi 1997: 151) since Parvez has protected Bettina of a very violent client. We do not learn that in the film. It is also mentioned in the text that Parvez can \\"talk to her about things he'd never be able to discuss with his own wife\\". This shows that they are good friends and trust each other, but in the text there is no evidence that the prostitute Bettina and the taxi- driver Parvez have a love affair as in the film. In the film this \\"sexual dimension\\" (Moore- Gilbert 2001: 164) is developed to show how Farid leads his father into despair. At home Parvez does not have a partner to communicate with. His wife, Minoo, who is rarely mentioned and not named in the short story, is always doing work and doesn't talk much with her husband. The main thing they talk about is Parvez's job. Therefore, Minoo is a more complex figure in the film than in the text. She develops from the loving mother which she is in the opening scene to the \\"servant in her own home after the deric's arrival, even being required to eat apart from her husband.\\" (Moore- Gilbert 2001: 166) The character of Schitz, the German entrepreneur who is present through nearly the entire film, is one of the more complex characters of those added in the film. Schitz can be seen as a \\"comparison with Parvez, reminding the audience that there are different kinds of economic migrants, whose reception by the 'host' society varies according to the migrants national origin, class and ethnic identity.\\" (Moore- Gilbert 2001: 165) Schitz represents industrial renewal and revolution. He comes from Germany, which has just been united again, to Great Britain and \\"represents the growing influence of Europe on Britain, in which a newly united Germany is the economic dynamo and, as such, a potentially oppressive force.\\" (Moore- Gilbert 2001: 166) With reference to business, Schitz is a stereotype of the successful white businessman with a lot of money. He likes to spend his money and to look down on people of other social classes as he does in the case of Parvez. In the film Schitz jokes about Parvez when Parvez tells him that he always wanted to be in the cricket team of the company he worked for when he came to England. Later in the nightclub, Schitz also laughs at Parvez because of his Pakistani accent. This accent is a feature the film uses to create cultural differences. The father who leads a western life speaks English with a Pakistani accent whereas his son who is a fundamentalist speaks Standard English. You may also see Mr. Schitz as the contrast to Farid's world. Mr. Schitz embodies everything that Farid hates about the Western World. Although Farid is in conflict with his father and not with Mr. Schitz and does not even know him, these two characters represent the two conflicting ways of life. Farid is the religious fundamentalist and Mr. Schitz is a godless libertine. Farid's, or Ali's; new attitudes towards the world he has lived in since his birth lead to a very big conflict between him and his father. This conflict is in the short story and in the film which both start in media represented at the beginning. The short story opens with Parvez sitting in Ali's room. The narrator who is not part of the story and therefore a heterodiegetic narrator narrates that Parvez is \\"bewildered\\" (Kureishi 1997: 147) by the fact that his son is getting tidier. He also explained briefly Ali's old behaviour to give reason for Parvez worries. Then the reader learns that Ali had an \\"English girlfriend from whom he has parted.\\" (Kureishi 1997: 147) The film opens with a scene that shows Farid's family at a visit at the Fingerhut's house. Parvez is very enthusiastic and already plans his son's wedding. The short story creates at its opening a very calm atmosphere of an average father worrying about his son. There cannot be found any hints than the names that they are not a family of British origin. Whereas in the film, it is obvious from the beginning Parvez's family has emigrated to Britain. Parvez's wife is dressed in traditional Pakistani clothes, but she does not have her face veiled, Parvez speaks with his Pakistani accent and Minoo and Parvez speak Urdu, their native language, to each other. At the beginning, Farid seems ashamed of his father when he is taking the pictures of the Fingerhuts. But his shame initially looks like the usual embarrassment teenagers sometimes have for their parents and not the disgust that Farid, and Ali, develops throughout the story. The short story says that Parvez and Ali once \\"were brothers\\". (Kureishi 1997: 150) But that is a thing which Parvez tells the reader and the reader does not learn anything about Ali's view of this. This statement underlines Parvez's worries about his son. In the text and the film, Parvez is presented as a loving father who wants the best for his son. He always was \\"aware of the pitfalls that other men's sons had stumbled to in England.\\" (Kureishi 2001: 148) He wants to give his son a better life than he once had. That is the reason for him to work \\"long hours\\" (Kureishi 2001: 149) and to spend a lot of money on his son's education. And while Parvez was dreaming of a better life in Britain he did not realise that something had gone wrong with his son. After a conversation with his friends and with Bettina Parvez worries about his son taking drugs. In the film it is shown how Parvez checks Farid's temperature. Farid's reaction shows that he knows what his father is looking for and therefore he stretches out his arm to show his veins. While Parvez keeps his son under surveillance he follows him into the mosque. There Parvez is confronted with the fact that his son is not just becoming religious. He changes to a fundamentalist. A Muslim in the mosque tells Parvez that those boys, the group of boys which includes his own son, are not welcomed in the mosque because they always want to change the people's opinion. Farid is presented in a more radical way in the film than in the short story. In the short story Ali shows his disgust for his father in the conversation they have when they are out for dinner. Ali offends his father, but does not do anything more. He just wants to state his view of things. Whereas at the nearly end of the film Farid and his friends attack the prostitutes violently. They throw Molotov cocktails into the prostitutes' house and Farid spits at Bettina. This violence may be seen as an influence the maulvi took on them because he is added in the film and does not exist in the short story where an attack like that does not happen. The maulvi takes very much influence on Farid and helps him to become more fanatic. He even gives introductions, as Farid tells Parvez in Fizzie's restaurant, when they are having dinner. Farid trusts more the maulvi ideals of life than his fathers.

His real name was Shina Norishige, and he was also called Yasabur≈ç; \\"Yamazaki S≈çkan\\" was a pen-name (haimy≈ç). Biography Originally serving as a court calligrapher for the ninth Ashikaga sh≈çgun, Ashikaga Yoshihisa, the poet became a Buddhist monk and entered seclusion following the sh≈çgun's death in 1489. Traveling through Settsu and Yamashiro provinces, he finally settled in a place called Yamazaki. Establishing his hermitage, which he named Taigetsu-an, he adopted the name Yamazaki S≈çkan. The location of this hermitage is debated, since the town of Shimamoto, Osaka, claims to contain its remains, as does the My≈çkian, a temple in ≈åyamazaki, Kyoto. S≈çkan left Yamazaki in 1523 and settled five years later in the town of Kan'onji in Sanuki province. On the grounds of K≈çsh≈çji, he made a hermitage for himself called Ichiya-an, where he spent the rest of his life composing poems. Though his poems were not widely distributed at first, they were soon compiled into a text called Daitsukubash≈´. He also compiled and edited the Inu-tsukuba-sh≈´ (Áä¨Á≠ëÊ≥¢ÈõÜ), another important anthology of renga and haikai. His unrefined style came to be influential and inspired the development of the danrin style of poetry, which emerged in the early 17th century.

The village lies within the Goathland civil parish and the North York Moors national park. Geography and description Beck Hole is located at approximately above sea level in the North York Moors, in the valley of the Murk Esk River, a tributary of the River Esk. The village is approximately roughly north-west of Goathland and within the same civil parish. It is accessed by a road with very steep gradients on either side of the village. The North Yorkshire Moors Railway passes the village close by to the north.Ordnance survey. 1:25000. 2009 The majority of the structures in the village are listed, including several 18th century sandstone buildings: the Birch Hall Inn (cottages and with 19th century extension), Fir Tree farmhouse, Brookwood farmhouse (outbuildings to Fir Tree farm, now dwellings), 'The White House', and 'Old Woodbine'. Also listed are the 19th century stone bridge over the Ellerbeck, and the 19th century former public house, the 'Lord Nelson'.Sources: On the outskirts of the village are further historic buildings: the G.T. Andrews designed former railway building, 'Incline Cottage'; and 'Lins' a 17th-century longhouse. History The origins of Beck Hole date to the Middle Ages; it was set within the Forest of Pickering, which began to be cleared in the 13th century. The first records referencing the village, originally known as Amerholm, date to the late 16th century, and mention a single farmstead. A fulling mill was in operation at the river bank around this period. The 'Bulls Head' public house was established around 1770, in a house built . The building was renamed the 'Lord Nelson' in 1801, and rebuilt around 1850. It closed as a public house in 1940. One of the key landmarks in Bechole is the single Scots Pine within the garden of Firtree house. The tree date back to the construction of the house where it was said that houses with a Scots pine where royalest and faithful. At the time of planting two trees resided until before the 1900s the second was struck with lightning and burnt down. The Whitby and Pickering Railway was opened in 1836, with the incline from Beckhole to Goathland worked as a rope hauled cable railway. A railway station was established. The incline was replaced by a deviation in 1865, part of the line remained in use as a branch to Beck Hole until it closed in 1951. In the late 1850s the Whitby Iron Company was formed and began extraction of iron stone around Beckhole; two blast furnaces were built which began production of iron in 1860. At around the same time a row of 33 cottages was built for industrial workers, and the Birch Hall Inn was expanded and gained a licence. The operation was unsuccessful, and short- lived, hampered by a fault in one of the furnaces, and landslips at a mine. The blast furnaces ceased operation in 1864, and the works were put up for sale in 1876, and were sold in 1888, being demolished in the following years. The worker's terrace also demolished. The village was connected to Egton by a main road after 1868. Mains electricity and mains water reached the village in the decade after the Second World War.  Beckhole Woodland and Heritage Foundation  Beckhole Woodland and Heritage Foundation was formed by residents of Beckhole in 2006 in order to preserve and protect the ancient woodland of the valley and interpret the wealth of local heritage. In Victorian times Beckhole was famous for its many orchards. Visitors would come from miles around to enjoy the walks & waterfalls and take tea beneath the apple trees.. In 2009 the Goathland School celebrated its Bi-centenary. The BHWF decided to mark the occasion by planting an apple orchard on land in Beckhole - kindly provided by the Ainley family, formerly of Firs Farm. With help from The Tree Council, donations from Goathland Post Office, the North York Moors National Park and collection boxes at The Birch Hall Inn money was raised to prepare the orchard and plant 20 different heritage apple trees, each of which has been adopted by a child from Goathland School. Trees were planted on 1 March 2009 and once they were established the children came down to 'meet' their trees on 24 April. It's just on the side of the Rail Trail before the Ellerbeck Footbridge.

It was released in France on 1 November 2006, followed by limited release in the U.S. on 22 June 2007 and in the UK on 24 August 2007.Release Info at IMDb The film won the 2007 C√©sar Award for Best Film and stars Jean-Louis Coulloc'h and Marina Hands. Plot In an English country house, Sir Clifford Chatterley lives with his wife Constance. Severely wounded in World War I, he is paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair. Constance tries to be a good wife, but he is distant and her life is empty. One day the maid is ill and Constance goes to see Parkin, the gamekeeper, about some pheasants for the table. Approaching the hut in the woods where he works, she sees him stripped to the waist and washing himself; the sight perturbs her. She is falling into a depression, for which the doctor says there is no physical cause, urging her to take charge of her life and not give in as her mother did. Told that the first daffodils are blooming in the woods, she ventures out to pick some, but the effort tires her and she has to sit. Parkin grudgingly lets her rest on the steps of the hut, where she falls asleep. Feeling relaxed there, she resolves to visit more often and asks her husband for a duplicate key. He says he does not have one, so Constance asks Parkin, who is reluctant but as an employee has to, in the end, produce one. She starts going to the hut regularly, taking an interest in the taciturn Parkin's work. When taking hold of a recently hatched pheasant chick, the tremor of new life in her hand sets Constance weeping uncontrollably. Parkin comforts her and, with her mute assent, has brief forceful sex. He is uneasy afterwards, but Constance feels liberated and starts meeting him secretly for more sessions. As he gets more comfortable with her, their lovemaking becomes more tender and intense, one day cavorting naked in the rain and decorating each other with flowers. Sir Clifford confronts Constance with a rumor that she is pregnant, which she denies. The two discuss the possibility of her conceiving a child with another man, giving her a baby and Sir Clifford an heir. She says she might do so when she goes on holiday with her sister to the Mediterranean. Taking more of an interest in life, Sir Clifford buys a motorized wheelchair and ventures into the woods, but it gets stuck and stalls. In rage and frustration, he will let nobody help him, though eventually Constance and Parkin do push him home. Before going off on holiday, Constance spends the whole night with Parkin in his cottage, from which he has cleared all traces of his wife, who has gone to live with another man. She tells him she has money from her dead mother and would like to buy him a small farm so that he could be independent. While on holiday, Constance gets a letter from Sir Clifford's nurse with all the local gossip. This includes the news that Parkin's wife, thrown out by her lover, returned to their home. Parkin went to court to get her thrown out, but was told he would have to divorce her first. Constance heads back to England to find that Sir Clifford has been making further efforts to live more normally and has begun to walk on crutches. She also learns that, in a fight with the lover, Parkin was beaten up and, because of the scandal, has had to resign as gamekeeper. Going to see Parkin, she tells him she is pregnant, but he is not happy because the child will, in the eyes of the law, be Sir Clifford's. Having lost his job and his home, he will have to live with his mother and find work in a factory. He talks of emigrating to Canada, but Constance says that is no solution and wants him near her. Eventually, he accepts her offer of buying him a small farm and agrees that they must part until the baby is born. If she then decides to leave Sir Clifford, he says he will take her.

Early life Born in 1930 at Freehold Borough, New Jersey, Flicker attended Admiral Farragut Academy in Tom's River, New Jersey from 1947 to 1949. From 1949 to 1951, he studied at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, alongside fellow drama students Joan Collins and Larry Hagman. Theatre career In 1954, he became a member of Chicago's Compass Theater, America's first theater of improvisational comedy. Eventually, he worked as producer, director, and performer with the Compass Players in St. Louis. The company was such a success that he was able to raise money to establish the Crystal Palace Theater, then the only monthly repertory stage in the country. In 1959 he wrote the book and directed the Broadway musical The Nervous Set. Fran Landesman provided the lyrics, and Tommy Wolf the musical score. The only 'beat musical', it was the source of the standard tune \\"Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most.\\" The show was revived in 2006. In 1960, he established The Premise on New York's Bleecker Street in a basement venue, where he initially appeared alongside Tom Aldredge, George Segal, and Joan Darling.Tallmer, Jerry. \\"Theatre: The Premise\\".

A follow-up improvisational satire, The Premise in Living Color, targeted racism and featured Godfrey Cambridge, Diana Sands, and Al Freeman Jr. Film and television career Moving into motion pictures, Flicker directed and co-wrote (with Henry) the screenplay for his first film The Troublemaker in 1964. As a filmmaker, he is probably best known for his political lampoon The President's Analyst (1967) with James Coburn, although he cites Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang (1978) among his personal favorites. An occasional actor, he is the first victim in Beware! The Blob! (1972), directed by Larry Hagman. He also rides at full gallop as Buffalo Bill Cody in The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1981), debut-directed by cinematographer William A Fraker, who shot The President's Analyst. As the writer of the pilot for the television series Barney Miller (1975), he became the show's co-owner, and also wrote and/or directed episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Andy Griffith Show, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Night Gallery, The Streets of San Francisco, and I Dream of Jeannie. Flicker also appeared as the Devil in a 1971 episode of Night Gallery he had written called Hell's Bells. Other ventures Flicker has written extensively on expressionism and how it applies to his own art, and is the author of the epic novel The Good American, one of the first books to be marketed exclusively on the Internet.

Their northside home abuts a sculpture garden displaying his own works as well as those of Allan Houser, Paul Moore, Tony Price, Michael Bergt, and others. On May 13, 1994, Flicker legally changed his name to Ted Flicker. Flicker died in his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on the night of September 12, 2014. He was 84.
