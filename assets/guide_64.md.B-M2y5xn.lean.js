The VCC comprises of: * Headquarters VCC. Based at Whale Island in Portsmouth. * VCC Training Centre. Based at . * Royal Naval VCC. Units in , and . * Royal Marines VCC. Units (Divisions) in Arbroath, Lympstone, Portsmouth, Gosport and Plymouth. plus the Band of the RMVCC Plymouth and the Band of the RMVCC Gosport. The VCC is not part of the Sea Cadet Corps but exists alongside it as part of the Royal Navy's 'Navy Cadets' organization, which also includes CCF(RN) and RN Recognised Sea Scouts. The Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps are part of the Royal Marines Cadets family alongside the Royal Marines Cadets of the Sea Cadet Corps and Combined Cadet Force. History of the VCC The VCC traces its history back to the formation of the Royal Marines Artillery Cadet Corps (RMACC) in the Mission Hall, Prince Albert Street, Eastney on 14 February 1901. The new Cadet Corps was then based at the now closed Royal Marines Eastney Barracks in Portsmouth. It was formed, so the story goes, to \\"gainfully occupy the spare time of sons of senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs)\\" after an occasion when the colonel's office window was broken by a ball kicked by an SNCO's son playing outside. The RMACC was initially formed with the motto 'Manners Maketh Man', and re-titled as the Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps in the mid-20th century. Girls were accepted and the current title was adopted by all units in the 1970s. However, RMVCC Portsmouth only accepted girls from the mid-1990s. Since 1901, units were also formed at the Royal Marine Barracks, Chatham, Deal, Kent, Forton Barracks, Gosport and Stonehouse Barracks, Plymouth. Later on, another unit was formed at Lympstone, Devon (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines). RMVCC Deal closed when the Royal Marines School of Music left the town and moved to HMNB Portsmouth; RMVCC Chatham transferred to the Sea Cadet Corps when Pay & Records Royal Marines left Chatham in the 1960s, and RMVCC Gosport was disbanded and then re-formed as a non-MOD cadet marching band in the 1970s following the traditions of the Royal Marines Light Infantry but closed again in 2006. Cadets from the RMVCC have appeared at Navy Days and the Royal Tournament as well as in the 1955 film The Cockleshell Heroes. As of 6 July 2014, following a tri-partite RMC parade at Buckingham Palace in the presence of The Duke of Edinburgh (Captain General Royal Marines) and in celebration of the 350th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Marines, all cadets from the RMVCC, RMSCC and RMCCF can be titled as Royal Marines Cadets. The Royal Naval Volunteer Cadet Corps was formed in 1904 when the officer in charge of HMS Victory barracks in Portsmouth, now known as HMS Nelson, requested permission from Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth to form a cadet corps unit similar to the Royal Marines Artillery Cadets in Eastney. The Admiralty granted permission and soon units were also established at HM Dockyard Devonport, HM Dockyard Chatham, , HMS Daedalus, and , as well as the three RNVCC units that still exist today. Entry was originally restricted to the sons of serving ratings but was later opened up to boys and girls from the general public. The date of the request, 29 July 1904, is regarded as the birthday of the Royal Naval Cadets. Tragedy struck the RNVCC in 1929 when four Royal Naval Cadets were killed during the Gillingham Fair in what is now known as the Gillingham Fair fire disaster.Time Magazine, July 22, 1929 There was equally a sad occasion in the Medway area when 24 Royal Marines Cadets from RMVCC Chatham were killed in the Gillingham bus disaster in December 1951. Structure and Organisation Each VCC unit is staffed by unpaid adult volunteers, some with former military service, and sometimes with current serving personnel helping the Cadet Corps in addition to their duties. The units are under the command of their own Commanding Officers (usually a cadet force adult volunteer (CFAV) who report into HQVCC, led by two Executive Officers (one each for RNVCC and RMVCC) and a senior CFAV officer as Commander VCC. The VCC as a whole does not have charitable status but each unit is either a charity or in the process of applying. Each VCC unit is either based within or provided support from a designated Royal Navy parent establishment. The CO of the parent establishment acts as the President of each unit and appoints a senior officer from their staff to act as the Liaison Officer to ensure that the CO is running their unit in accordance with the VCC Regulations. Sponsorship within the Royal Navy is provided by the Cadets and Youth (CY) group (branded as 'Navy Cadets') under the command of the Assistant Chief of Staff (Training) (ACOS(T)) who in turn reports to Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST). The support provided to the VCC is governed by a Memorandum of Arrangements (MOA) approved by the Second Sea Lord. The VCC does not have an associated civilian charity or association and has always been under the command of the Royal Navy. In this way the VCC is very much 'owned' by the Royal Navy. The ceremonial head of the VCC is the Commandant VCC, currently awaiting appointment. The RMVCC shares the Colonel Commandant Royal Marines Cadets (CCRMC), currently Brigadier Ged Salzano MBE, with the Royal Marines Cadets elements of the SCC and CCF. In November 2019, TV celebrity and former Royal Marines Commando Ant Middleton was appointed as the first Chief Cadet in the VCC. ‚ÄúWhat a privilege and honour to be appointed Chief Cadet in the VCC. I absolutely thrive on mentoring our future generation‚Äù Ant said upon his appointment at a brief ceremony in the Wardroom at HMS Excellent. The Motto of the RMVCC is now 'Be Worthy' and the Motto of the RNVCC and VCC overall is 'Meet The Challenge!'. Funding The VCC receives a modest capitation grant from central government each year, but otherwise is self-funding apart from the logistical support each unit receives from their parent establishments. Additional funding is usually self-raised through events and display groups, plus donations and subscriptions/joining fees paid by the cadets. Membership The VCC will accept boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 17 who can serve until their 18th birthday. The VCC is not a pre-service organisation, although any older cadets who show an interest in joining any branch of HM Armed Forces will be given support and guidance. Many cadets go on to equally rewarding civilian careers. Adult volunteers may join from age 18 to 60 (65 for non-uniformed support staff) subject to application, interview, references and DBS check. Activities and Training Cadets can take part in a variety of activities including: * Drill. * Camps including Weekends and Summer Camp. * Fieldcraft. * Military skills (i.e.: camouflage and field exercises). * Navigation (including Ten Tors on Dartmoor). * Seamanship. * Band. * Sports and gymnastics. * Target shooting. * Parades. Boys and girls join their chosen VCC unit as 'recruits' and undergo a 4 to 5 month basic training period before 'passing out' for duty during a ceremonial parade in front of family and friends. Where a unit has a band cadets can choose either to become a musician or drummer, or proceed to Naval General Training (RNVCC) or General Duties Training (RMVCC). Cadets then follow the VCC's Cadet Common Military Syllabus (CCMS) and progress through a number of phases and command courses to achieve promotion. Each unit usually meets on two training nights per week, and some unit offer extra activities such as evening swimming lessons. There are also many weekends away and a week long annual summer camp. The VCC also provides Display Teams that appear at public events in the South West and South East of England, and sometimes further afield. In recent times, the VCC has appeared at the Castle Combe Steam Rally, Cumbria Steam Rally, Attleborough Tattoo, Kirkcudbright Tattoo and the Battle of the Flowers in Jersey. The Display Teams generally provide a 20 to 25 minute display and are ideal for fetes, fayres, tattoos, carnivals and other such public events. A modest donation is asked for, which is put towards the cost of attending, and any funds left over are put back into the VCC to fund its other activities.

Training is offered to all staff, including safeguarding, both locally and through RN, RM and SCC shared resources. Applications are welcomed from all walks of life (subject to intended level of involvement) and previous military experience is not a basic requirement; a willingness to learn and be an example to the cadets very much is however. CFAVs follow the same ranks as cadets above Petty Officer and Sergeant respectively but with RNVCC or RMVCC after their names. Some CFAVs may be awarded a Cadet Forces Commission subject to selection and approval by the Royal Navy. Uniformed staff may serve until their 65th birthday (with annual extensions at CO's discretion) and non-uniformed staff may serve until their 70th birthday (again, with annual extensions at CO's discretion).

He lost his father when he was two years old and his mother when he was ten. He then lived with his maternal aunt. Salaam attended Ansar-U-Deen Primary School, Ejigbo (1975-1981), Baptist School, Ola (1981-1986) and Baptist High School, Ejigbo (1986-1987). He attended Oyo State College of Arts and Science for his 'A' level studies (1987-1989). He was admitted to Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife in 1989 to study political science and was awarded a bachelor of science (BSc) degree in political science (Second Class Upper) in 1993. He earned a master of political science there in 2013 and went on to successfully bagged a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the same discipline of Political Science (with specialization in [Nigerian] Federalism, Ethnic Relations and Democratic Studies) in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, on January 5, 2018 . Salaam attended leadership and capacity building courses in the United Kingdom, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, etc.  Career  Salaam's initiation into politics began during his undergraduate days when he became involved in the student rights movement, particularly in the activities of the Association of Political Science Students. He was an active member of the Constitution Review Committee. He was also involved in the activities of Ejigbo Local Government Area Students Association (ELGASA), OAU Chapter, where he became president. Upon graduation, Salaam went into the pharmacy business. Because of his knowledge about community health and his health interventions in Ejigbo, he was made a supervisory Councillor for Health in 1999. In 2002 he unsuccessfully ran for the highest position in local government. In 2007, he campaigned for a seat in the Osun State House of Assembly, and was elected. In 2009 a court of appeal nullified his election on the ground that a logo of one of the political parties was excluded from the ballot papers in gross violation of the electoral laws. The Court of Appeal ordered a new election. A candidate of the Peoples' Democratic Party was declared winner. Due to his popularity, political acceptability and support throughout Ejigbo, Salaam was believed to be uncompromising when it came to the ideals of his political party, despite pressure from the ruling party. In the 2011 elections, Salaam contest and won a seat in Osun state Assembly. = Speakership = Salaam was elected Assembly Speaker on June 2, 2011. He was elected Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the Conference of Speakers of States Legislature, with a mandate to midwife new executive members of the Conference through a free and fair election.

The laws involved HIV/AIDS, signage and street advertising, security trust funds and urban renewal. He was re-elected as the Speaker. As of 8 January 2017 the Assembly had passed 7 bills, 2 resolutions and conducted 3 public hearings. One of the bills established a microcredit agency, seeking to stimulate economic activity. Under his leadership the Assembly is reputed to have operated in a rancour-free atmosphere, working harmoniously with the executive. This friendly relationship has been questioned by his critics. They see the House as toothless and a rubber-stamp of the executive. In defence, some members of the assembly have come out to say that harmony exists between the executive and legislature and is good for democracy.

Due to issues mostly about privacy, it has been the subject of a number of negative assessments by various groups.  General criticism  Critics have noted that Windows10 heavily emphasizes freemium services and contains various advertising facilities. Some outlets have considered these to be a hidden \\"cost\\" of the free upgrade offer. Examples include media storefronts, Office 365, paid functionality in bundled games such as Microsoft Solitaire Collection, default settings that display promotions of \\"suggested\\" apps in Start menu and \\"tips\\" on the lock screen that may contain advertising, ads displayed in File Explorer for Office 365 subscriptions on Redstone 2 builds, and notifications promoting the Microsoft Edge web browser when a different browser is set as default. = Update system = Windows 10 Home is permanently set to download all updates automatically, including cumulative updates, security patches, and drivers, and users cannot individually select updates to install or not. Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool that can be used to hide updates and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had been already installed, then uninstalled without rebooting the system. Tom Warren of The Verge felt that, given web browsers such as Google Chrome had already adopted such an automatic update system, such a requirement would help to keep all Windows10 devices secure, and felt that \\"if you're used to family members calling you for technical support because they've failed to upgrade to the latest Windows service pack or some malware disabled Windows Update then those days will hopefully be over.\\" Concerns were raised that due to these changes, users would be unable to skip the automatic installation of updates that are faulty or cause issues with certain system configurationsalthough build upgrades will also be subject to public beta testing via the Windows Insider Program. There were also concerns that the forced installation of driver updates through Windows Update, where they were previously designated as \\"optional\\", could cause conflicts with drivers that were installed independently of Windows Update. Such a situation occurred just prior to the general release of the operating system, when an Nvidia graphics card driver that was automatically pushed to Windows10 users via Windows Update caused issues that prevented the use of certain functions, or prevented their system from booting at all. Criticism was also directed towards Microsoft's decision to no longer provide specific details on the contents of cumulative updates for Windows 10. On February 9, 2016, Microsoft reversed this decision and began to provide release notes for cumulative updates on the Windows website. Windows 10 has also received criticism due to deleting files without user permission after major updates. There can be multiple causes, such as a (now resolved) bug in the upgrade process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo8TXGcMxS4 programs that are deemed to be incompatible with the new version of Windows and thus get uninstalled, a setting that didn't propagate properly when upgrading to Windows 10,https://hetmanrecovery.com/recovery_news/attention-does-windows-10-delete- files-without-confirmation.htm or malware being detected in the files.https://answers.microsoft.com/en- us/windows/forum/windows_8-security/how-to-stop-windows-defender-from- deleting-a/f4e3641a-5598-495d-b2a5-bd6ead226071? Some users reported that during the installation of the November upgrade, some applications (particularly utility programs such as CPU-Z and Speccy) were automatically uninstalled during the upgrade process, and some default programs were reset to Microsoft-specified defaults (such as Photos app, and Microsoft Edge for PDF viewing), both without warning. Application .exe files would often get deleted automatically during updates. Further issues were discovered upon the launch of the Anniversary Update (\\"Redstone\\"), including a bug that caused some devices to freeze (but addressed by cumulative update KB3176938, released on August 31, 2016), and that fundamental changes to how Windows handles webcams had caused many to stop working. =Distribution practices= A screenshot of the \\"Get Windows 10\\" free upgrade window on Windows 7 Microsoft was criticized for the tactics that it used to promote its free upgrade campaign for Windows 10, including adware-like behaviors, using deceptive user interfaces to coax users into installing the operating system, downloading installation files without user consent, and making it difficult for users to suppress the advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to 10. The upgrade offer was marketed and initiated using the \\"Get Windows 10\\" (GWX) application, which was first downloaded and installed via Windows Update in March 2015. Registry keys and Group Policy settings could be used to partially disable the GWX mechanism, but the installation of patches to the GWX software via Windows Update could reset these keys back to defaults, and thus reactivate the software. Third-party programs were also created to assist users in applying measures to disable GWX. In September 2015, it was reported that Microsoft was triggering automatic downloads of the Windows10 installation files on all compatible Windows7 or 8.1computers configured to automatically download and install updates, regardless of whether or not they had specifically requested the upgrade. Microsoft officially confirmed the change, claiming it was \\"an industry practice that reduces time for installation and ensures device readiness.\\" This move was criticized by users who have data caps or devices with low storage capacity, as resources were consumed by the automatic downloads of up to 6GB of data. Other critics argued that Microsoft should not have triggered any downloading of Windows10 installation files without user consent. In October 2015, Windows10 began to appear as an \\"Optional\\" update in the Windows Update interface, but pre- selected for installation on some systems. A Microsoft spokesperson said that this was a mistake, and that the download would no longer be pre-selected by default. However, on October 29, 2015, Microsoft announced that it planned to classify Windows10 as a \\"recommended\\" update in the Windows Update interface some time in 2016, which will cause an automatic download of installation files and a one-time prompt with a choice to install to appear. In December 2015, it was reported that a new advertising dialog had begun to appear, only containing \\"Upgrade now\\" and \\"Upgrade tonight\\" buttons, and no obvious method to decline installation besides the close button. In March 2016, some users also alleged that their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had automatically begun upgrading to 10 without their consent. In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an InfoWorld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing showed that the upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the \\"Accept\\" prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted that the company had \\"gone too far\\", by using this tactic, stating that \\"we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you‚Äôre not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and for a lot of the year I think we got it right.\\" On January 21, 2016, Microsoft was sued in small claims court by a user whose computer, shortly after the release of the OS, had attempted to upgrade to Windows10 without her consent. The upgrade failed, and her computer was left in an unstable state thereafter, which disrupted the ability to run her travel agency. The court ruled in favor of the user and awarded her $10,000 in damages, but Microsoft appealed. However, in May 2016, Microsoft dropped the appeal and chose to pay the damages. Shortly after the suit was reported on by the Seattle Times, Microsoft confirmed that it was updating the GWX software once again to add more explicit options for opting out of a free Windows 10 upgrade; the final notification was a full-screen pop-up window notifying users of the impending end of the free upgrade offer, and contained \\"Remind me later\\", \\"Do not notify me again\\" and \\"Notify me three more times\\" options. = Privacy and data collection = Concerns were shown by advocates and other critics for Windows10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data. Under the default \\"Express\\" settings, Windows 10 is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties, including the collection of user contacts, calendar data, computer's appearance including color of the chassis and \\"associated input data\\" to personalize \\"speech, typing, and inking input\\", typing and inking data to improve recognition, allow apps to use a unique \\"advertising ID\\" for analytics and advertising personalization (functionality introduced by Windows 8.1) and allow apps to request the user's location data and send this data to Microsoft and \\"trusted partners\\" to improve location detection (Windows 8 had similar settings, except that location data collection did not include \\"trusted partners\\"). Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows 10. The use of Cortana intelligent personal assistant also requires the collection of data \\"such as your device location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and how often you interact with them on your device‚Äù to personalize its functionality. Rock Paper Shotgun writer Alec Meer argued that Microsoft's intent for this data collection lacked transparency, stating that \\"there is no world in which 45 pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13 different Settings screens and an external website constitutes 'real transparency'.\\" ExtremeTech pointed out that, whilst previously campaigning against Google for similar data collection strategies, \\"[Microsoft] now hoovers up your data in ways that would make Google jealous.\\" However, it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm, citing the increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing, as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as Google Now and Siri. In August 2015, Russian politician Nikolai Levichev called for Windows 10 to be banned from use by the Russian government, as it sends user data to servers in the United States (a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country, or be blocked, took effect September 2016). Writing for ZDNet, Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in Windows10 indicated \\"how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015.\\" In a Computerworld editorial, Preston Gralla said, \\"The kind of information Windows10 gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather. But Microsoft is held to a different standard than other companies.\\" Microsoft Services Agreement reads that the company's online services may automatically \\"download software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices.\\" Critics interpreted this statement as implying that Microsoft would scan for and delete unlicensed software installed on devices running Windows10. However, others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for Microsoft online services such as Microsoft account, Office 365, Skype, as well as Xbox Live, and that the offending passage most likely referred to digital rights management on Xbox consoles and first-party games, and not plans to police pirated video games installed on Windows10 PCs. Despite this, some torrent trackers announced plans to block Windows10 users, also arguing that the operating system could send information to anti-piracy groups that are affiliated with Microsoft. Writing about these allegations, Ed Bott of ZDNet compared Microsoft's privacy policy to Apple's and Google's and concluded that \\"after carefully reading the Microsoft Services Agreement, the Windows license agreement...and the Microsoft Privacy Statement carefully, I don't see anything that looks remotely like Big Brother.\\" Columnist Kim Komando argued that \\"Microsoft might in the future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat,\\" consistent with the Windows10 update policy. Following the release of 10, allegations also surfaced that Microsoft had backported the operating system's increased data collection to Windows 7 and Windows 8 via \\"recommended\\" patches that added additional \\"telemetry\\" features. The updates' addition of a \\"Diagnostics Tracking Service\\" is connected specifically to Microsoft's existing Customer Experience Improvement Program (which is an opt-in program that sends additional diagnostic information to Microsoft for addressing issues), and the Application Experience service, which is typically intended for third-party software compatibility requests. This was achieved by including various DLLs and adding the telemetry service executable (all of which notably have versions pertaining to Windows 10 builds) as part of various updates from 2016 onward. The data collection functionality is capable of transmitting personal information, browsing history, the contents of emails, chat, video calls, voice mail, photos, documents, personal files and keystrokes to Microsoft, for analysis, in accordance with the End User License Agreement. The terms of services agreement from Microsoft was updated to state the following: In October 2017, the Dutch Data Protection Authority issued a complaint asserting that Windows10's privacy policies did not comply with the laws of the Netherlands, as it claims that Microsoft does not provide sufficient information on what information is collected at the \\"Full\\" telemetry level and how it is processed. Microsoft disputed the claim that it did not provide enough disclosure of the \\"Full\\" telemetry level, and stated that it was working with the DDPA to \\"find appropriate solutions\\".  Antitrust issues  In November 2016, Kaspersky Lab filed an antitrust complaint in Russia regarding the bundling of Windows Defender with the operating system, arguing that Microsoft was abusing its position to favor its own, in-house antivirus software over those of other vendors. In June 2017, Kaspersky filed another complaint with the European Commission, accusing the company of frustrating the use of third-party antivirus software on Windows 10 in defense of its \\"inferior\\" Windows Defender, including forcibly uninstalling third-party antivirus software during upgrades, and not providing enough time for antivirus developers to certify their software for each new upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft stated that the company \\"[engages] deeply with antimalware vendors and have taken a number of steps to address their feedback\\", and that they had offered to meet Kaspersky executives to discuss any specific concerns. On June 21, 2017, Microsoft issued a blog post confirming that since the \\"Creators Update\\", Windows 10 may prompt users to temporarily disable their antivirus software upon installation of a feature update if the current version is not deemed to be compatible, and that the operating system would direct users to relevant updates to their software following the conclusion of the update. Microsoft stated that it had worked with vendors to perform compatibility testing of their software with the update, and to \\"specify which versions of their software are compatible and where to direct customers after updating.\\" Microsoft reported that as a result of these efforts, around 95% of Windows 10 users \\"had an antivirus application installed that was already compatible with Windows 10 Creators Update\\". Microsoft clarified that Windows Defender only operates if the device does not have any other security software installed, or if security software reports that a subscription had lapsed. In Summer 2018, a Windows 10 Insider update received extreme backlash for a planned feature that would have attempted to prevent the installation of other web browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox, telling users that they already have Microsoft Edge and therefore there is no need to change their browser.

It has a single, sparsely hairy, long, thin leaf and one or two pink flowers. Description Caladenia variegata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which usually grows singly, sometimes in colonies of up to ten. It has a single, dark green, sparsely hairy up to long, wide and which lies on the ground. One or two pink, occasionally white flowers about across are borne on a thick stem up to tall. The dorsal sepal is erect near its base but then curves forward, more or less forming a hood over the column and is greenish on its outer surface. The lateral sepals are broadly elliptic in shape and spread apart from each other, turning slightly downwards. The petals are also elliptic in shape but often sickle-shaped and have a pointed tip. The labellum is pale pink, white near its edges and has dark red bars. The sides of the labellum curve upwards, partly surrounding the column, the tip is yellow with notched edges and there are two rows of stalked calli with bright yellow heads along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia variegata was first formally described in 1885 by William Colenso and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. The specific epithet (variegata) is a Latin word meaning \\"of different sorts, particularly colors\\". Distribution and habitat Caladenia variegata occurs on both the North and South Islands of New Zealand and on the Chatham Islands, growing in forest, usually in leaf litter.

He agitated for political reform, displaying political posters in the windows of his draper's shop. He became Chairman of the Dudley Political Union, which advocated parliamentary reform, and had a leading role in the Dudley Chartist movement. His political agitation resulted in him being put on trial on many occasions. Life Samuel Cook was born on 15 July 1786 in Trowbridge. He was the son of Samuel and Amy Cook, his father being a cloth maker. Cook served an apprenticeship with a draper at Poole. He married Maria Jones in 1810. He commenced business in Liverpool. His first recorded political speech was in 1815 when he addressed a crowd outside his house on the occasion of the ending of the Napoleonic War. In 1819 he moved to Dudley where he set up a draper's shop on the High Street. The shop was situated at 77 and 78 High Street and was known as \\"Gibraltar House\\". He became active in Radical politics, agitating for parliamentary reform via the Dudley Political Union. One of his methods of political agitation was to display posters in the window of his shop. In 1823, Cook started a campaign against the Anglican Church authorities and against Church Rates when he published two posters. In 1826 he was arrested after he displayed a poster publicising a nailers' strike. A further poster describing his arrest was then exposed. Cook was then summoned to the Town Hall on accused of publishing a seditious libel, resulting in him being tried at the Worcester Assizes on 1 August 1827 before Mr. Justice Littledale. He was defended by John Campbell (later the MP for Dudley and holder of several government posts including Attorney General) and was found guilty. However, his punishment was light, being bound over for the sum ¬£200 to receive sentence \\"when called upon\\". Samuel's wife, Maria, died on 7 September 1827. In the early 1830s, campaigning organisations known as Political Unions began to form in a number of Black Country towns. Samuel Cook often chaired the regular meeting of the Dudley Political Union. In October 1833 he attended a meeting in Oldbury at which colliers demanded a reduction in daily working hours. As the speeches excited the crowd and the numbers attending increased, the magistrates ordered that the meeting was illegal and called out troops in order to keep the peace. Cook published \\"Some of the Principles of Dudley Radicalism\\" in 1834 in which, amongst other demands, he called for universal suffrage, vote by ballot, universal education, an end to Church Rates, a free press and marriages to be a civil ceremony. In 1836 Cook issued a poster calling on Thomas Badger, a Dudley magistrate, to step down following a conviction for assault. However, the verdict was overturned on appeal and Cook was charged and found guilty of publishing a libel. In 1837, Cook had goods seized from his shop due to non- payment of Church Rates. He had 3 pairs of blankets confiscated, valued at ¬£2 5s although he only owed 17s 11d. The Chartist leader Henry Vincent was invited to a meeting in Dudley in August 1838. Vincent gave an address followed by Cook and it was decided to re-organise the Dudley Political Union along Chartist lines. During 1839, Chartists were active both nationally and in the Midlands area, particularly at Birmingham where a riot took place on 15 July as police were brought in from London to stop meetings at the Bull Ring. On the 16 July, a meeting took place outside the Founders' Arms tavern in Dudley where Cook was present and Smith Lyndon, the main speaker, was alleged to have referred to the police as \\"blue devils\\" and \\"blood-thirsty villains\\". Both Cook and Lyndon were arrested and Cook was charged with incitement to break the peace. Put on trial on 18 October 1839 at Worcester, Cook was found guilty and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. Cook was not deterred from his political activity, however, and in January 1841, the Dudley National Charter Association was created with Cook as treasurer of the organization. In March 1842, the Chartist Leader, Feargus O'Connor attended the South Staffordshire Chartist rally. Cook was part of the reception party that met him at Wolverhampton. A large procession formed with the Dudley contingent marching 10 abreast holding a banner stating \\"Behold the Conquering Hero Comes\\" and a flag bearing the motto \\"More Pigs and Less Parsons\\". In May 1842, nailmakers in Dudley went on strike, as an economic downturn that had started in 1839 began to bite. From July of the same year, a series of strikes and riots broke out across the Black Country and around the Midlands. Samuel Cook was one of many activists arrested during the protest. In Cook's case, a poster displayed in his shop in August 1842, advertising a demonstration to be held in Birmingham, led to his arrest and imprisonment pending the Worcester Assizes. According to a contemporary newspaper report: he was \\"escorted by a division of yeomanry on his journey to Worcester\\". However, when the case came to trial at Worcester in October 1842, the prosecution decided not to pursue the case, leading to Cook being acquitted. In December 1843, Cook was declared bankrupt. In a hearing in the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court held on 6 February 1844, it was stated that debts owing were ¬£2,195 18s 11d; whereas assets, and good debts were ¬£60 15s 10d; and Cook's property was valued at ¬£548 3s. During the hearing, a solicitor, Mr. Wainwright, listed some of Cook's arrests and court appearances, leading to the following exchange: Mr Motteram ‚Äî The bankrupt has been a \\"martyr.\\" His Honour ‚Äî The bankrupt's creditors are martyrs. In 1847, Cook attempted to intervene in the election of the MP for Dudley, nominating a fellow Chartist, Joseph Linney, to oppose the sitting Tory MP, John Benbow. According to a local chronicler: \\"Mr. Joseph Linney was elected by the show of hands, by a large majority; the usual poll was demanded, and the day and time fixed upon, but, alas! for human greatness, poor Mr. Linney could not find the necessary guarantee (funds) for his election expenses, and his friends and admirers were in the same plight, so before the polling commenced, it oozed out that Mr. Linney had retired from the contest, leaving the old member master of the field. Thus, Mr. Benbow was again returned the member for the Castle interest in another Parliament.\\" The following day, a similar attempt was made at the election in Wolverhampton but this time Linney was proposer and Cook the candidate. As at Dudley, the attempt failed as the Chartists did not put up the election expenses, but Linney succeeded in making a speech before the crowd. In April 1855, Cook accompanied a delegation of colliers to meet a group of coal and ironmasters on the occasion of a colliers' strike. In December 1856 there were meetings against the Income Tax in the Black Country. At Dudley, where the mayor chaired the meeting, Cook seconded the motion proposing the abolition of the tax. Cook took the opportunity to call for an elected mayor (at this time the mayor was an official of the Court Leet of the Lord of the Manor) and a Municipal corporation for Dudley. Cook maintained his political activities until the end of his life. On 26 October 1860 he attended the meeting of the Court Leet of the Lord of the Manor of Dudley where he gave \\"his customary annual protest against the illegal appointment of a Mayor of Dudley\\" by that body. Shortly before his death, Cook was in correspondence with Giuseppe Garibaldi. Samuel died on 9 August 1861 and was buried at the Independent Chapel on King Street, Dudley. His drapers' business was passed on to his son Samuel Quartus Cook and stayed in the family in expanded premises on Dudley Upper High Street until 1983.

Mor√°n started creating the webcomic ¬°Eh, t√≠o! in April 2005, initially to write stories based on the experiences of him and his friends. This webcomic later evolved into a story about the adventures of a group of college students in a student residence. ¬°Eh, t√≠o! contains a huge number of pop culture references, and Mor√°n updates the webcomic multiple times per week. Mor√°n tries to balance non sequitur comedy and longer storylines, as he has found that the former are the most popular, while the latter keep his audience involved. In an interview with IGN, Mor√°n stated that he \\"was lucky enough to start when there were relatively few people\\" doing webcomics, which allowed him to stand out. Mor√°n writes the scripts of El Vosqu√©, which started on and has a more serious tone than his first webcomic. To create El Vosqu√©, Mor√°n collaborates with the artist Laurielle, who also creates the comedy webcomic Woodies. El Vosqu√© has multiple volumes in print, and was nominated for a Carlos Gim√©nez award in 2018.

He is known for innovations in the chemistry of photolithography, particularly the development of anti-reflective coatings and polymer photoresists that are used to create circuitry for computer chips. This work has supported the patterning of smaller features during the lithographic process, increasing miniaturization and microprocessor speed. Education Peter Trefonas is a son of Louis Marco Trefonas, also a chemist, and Gail Thames. He was inspired by Star Trek and the writings of Isaac Asimov, and created his own chemistry lab at home. Trefonas attended the University of New Orleans, receiving his Bachelor of Science in chemistry in 1980. While an undergraduate, Trefonas earned money by writing early computer games for personal computers. These included Worm, the first version of Snake to be written for a personal computer, and a clone of Hustle. Both were based on the Blockade arcade game. Trefonas also wrote a game based on Dungeons and Dragons. Trefonas studied at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Robert West, completing a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry in late 1984. Trefonas became interested in electronic materials after working with West and chip makers from IBM to create organosilicon bilayer photoresists. His thesis topic was Synthesis, properties and chemistry of organosilane and organogermane high polymers (1985). Career Trefonas joined MEMC Electronic Materials in late 1984. In 1986, he and others co- founded Aspect Systems Inc., utilizing photolithography technology acquired from MEMC. Trefonas worked at Aspect from 1986-1989. Then, through a succession of company acquisitions, he moved to Shipley Company (1990-2000), Rohm and Haas (1997-2008), to The Dow Chemical Company (2008-2019), and finally to DuPont (2019-current). Trefonas has published at least 127 journal articles and technical publications. He has received 105 American patents, and has more than 25 active patent applications pending. Research Throughout his career, Trefonas has focused on materials science and the chemistry of photolithography. By understanding the chemistry of photoresists used in lithography, he has been able to develop anti-reflective coatings and polymer photoresists that support finely-tuned etching used in the production of integrated circuits. These materials and techniques make it possible to fit more circuits into a given area. Over time, lithographic technologies have developed to allow lithography to use smaller wavelengths of light. Trefonas has helped to overcome a number of apparent limits to the sizes that are achievable, developing photoresists that are responsive to 436-nm and 365-nm ultraviolet light, and as small as 193 nm deep. In 1989, Trefonas and others at Aspect Systems Inc. reported on extensive studies of polyfunctional photosensitive groups in positive photoresists. They studied diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ), a chemical compound used for dissolution inhibition of novolak resin in photomask creation. They mathematically modeled effects, predicted possible optimizations, and experimentally verified their predictions. They found that chemically bonding together three of the molecules of DNQ to create a new molecule containing three dissolution inhibitors in a single molecule, led to a better feature contrast, with better resolution and miniaturization. These modified DNQs became known as \\"polyfunctional photoactive components\\" (PACs). This approach, which they termed polyphotolysis, has also been referred to as the \\"Trefonas Effect.\\" The technology of trifunctional diazonaphthoquinone PACs has become the industry standard in positive photoresists. Their mechanism has been elucidated and relates to a cooperative behavior of each of the three DNQ units in the new trifunctional dissolution inhibitor molecule. Phenolic strings from the acceptor groups of PACs that are severed from their anchors may reconnect to living strings, replacing two shorter polarized strings with one longer polarized string. Trefonas has also been a leader in the development of fast etch organic Bottom Antireflective Coating (BARC) BARC technology minimizes the reflection of light from the substrate when imaging the photoresist. Light that is used to form the latent image in the photoresist film can reflect back from the substrate and compromise feature contrast and profile shape. Controlling interference from reflected light results in the formation of a sharper pattern with less variability and a larger process window. In 2014, Trefonas and others at Dow were named Heroes of Chemistry by the American Chemical Society, for the development of Fast Etch Organic Bottom Antireflective Coatings (BARCs). In 2016, Trefonas was recognized with The SCI Perkin Medal for outstanding contributions to industrial chemistry. In 2018, Trefonas was named as a Fellow of the SPIE for \\"achievements in design for manufacturing & compact modeling.\\" Peter Trefonas was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2018 for the \\"invention of photoresist materials and microlithography methods underpinning multiple generations of microelectronics\\".

Its only competitive season was in 2016, and ceased operations the following year. Background Men's rodeo sports have long been governed by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). In 2015, approximately 5,000 cowboys and cowgirls purchased membership in PRCA. Membership allows them to compete at the 624 PRCA-sanctioned rodeos. Rodeos sanctioned by the PRCA must follow a defined format, offering a full set of required events. These rodeos have little control over which cowboys would compete, as they must use the PRCA's registration system, and are required to give the PRCA a percentage of the purse. Cowboys earn money only when they are among the top finishers at a rodeo event. In many cases, a win will earn them no more than $1,000. Each dollar of prize money earned at PRCA-sanctioned events is counted towards qualification for the annual National Finals Rodeo. There is no weighting for level of competition; a dollar earned at a rodeo against performed ranked in the top 20 counts the same as a dollar earned at a rodeo when competing against people who only ride once a year. In their attempts to become one of the 15 people in each event who qualify for the NFR, many cowboys compete at 100 or more rodeos per year, travelling more than per year. The 2014 PRCA world champions had annual earnings of $200,000 - $500,000. The costs of travel and the entry fees for these rodeos can become a considerable monetary burden; those who don't qualify for the NFR, with its large purse, can be put in a considerable financial bind. Female competitors, primarily barrel racers, are governed by the Women's Professional Rodeo Association. Members of the WPRA compete at PRCA-sanctioned rodeos and can qualify for the NFR. Not all rodeos are affiliated with the PRCA. After a series of lawsuits in the 1980s, cowboys earned the right to participate in both PRCA and independent rodeos. In 1992, 20 bull riders formed the Professional Bull Riders (PBR). They launched a tour of bull riding champions who also participated in the PRCA. The success of the PBR inspired the PRCA a decade later to create several small televised tours featuring champion rodeo athletes and offering large prizes. When a new PRCA commissioner took over in 2004, the PRCA was deeply in debt; he refocused the organization on the traditional competitions and not its stars. One of the premier indoor rodeos, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, received a waiver to test changes to the rodeo format. They offered fewer events, had a faster pace, and implemented a playoff-style competition. By using their own registration system, Houston was able to invite specific cowboys to specific days and advertise their individual appearances. Attendance jumped. When the PRCA refused to renew the waiver in 2011, Houston became independent. In 2014 a new independent rodeo, The American, launched with a similar format and one of the highest purses in rodeo. The new PRCA commissioner, Stressman, calls this \\"the 'Showdeo' business\\" and blames it, and organizations like the PBR, for a steady decline in PRCA membership. Formation Many of the elite cowboys became frustrated with the PRCA. They could see the success of the independent rodeos with large purses. They were tired with the pace and cost of the travel necessary to become NFR-qualified under the current guidelines. Fourteen of the elite athletes, two from each event, banded together to lobby the PRCA changes. These men included world champions Bobby Mote and Trevor Brazile. In discussions with PRCA representatives, they asked that two additional professional cowboys sit on the eleven-member PRCA board. Four contestants were already members of the board; decisions required seven votes. The cowboys even offered to stop competing at unsanctioned rodeos if contestant representation on the board was increased. When the PRCA declined to consider their offer, the men asked for a formal meeting, scheduled for February 2014. The PRCA sent lower-level representatives with no decision-making authority, infuriating the cowboys. The following morning, Brazile's agent, Tony Garritano, was able to get the men a conference call with the PRCA board. They categorically refused to entertain the possibility of a current competitor on the board. That was the last straw for the elite cowboys. The ERA was formed as a for-profit organization collectively owned by its competitors. They planned to compete against each other at several rodeos around the country, culminating in a world championship at the end of their season. Garritano became the first president. According to Garritano, having a professional tour of elite athletes would inspire kids to want to join the sport. Because the ERA only accepts competitors already at the top of their field, newcomers to the sport would have to join the PRCA, thus benefiting the sport as a whole. The PRCA promptly changed their bylaws. Cowboys with financial interest in any other rodeo association would be denied membership in the PRCA beginning with the 2016 season. ERA members would be disqualified from all PRCA rodeos, including the NFR. This held sweeping consequences; almost 50 of the competitors at the 2015 NFR were shareholders in the ERA. In November 2015, the ERA filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against the PRCA, with Bobby Mote, Trevor Brazile, and Ryan Motes as plaintiffs. Between them, the men had won 17 PRCA world championships. Federal district court judge Barbara Lynn ordered that the men could compete at PRCA circuit while she considered a preliminary injunction. Lynn denied the preliminary injunction in February 2016, although the antitrust lawsuit was allowed to proceed. The ruling came near the end of the multi-day Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo. ERA shareholders were forced to withdraw from the Fort Worth competition and forced to return any prize money they had earned. Soon after, the plaintiffs dropped their lawsuit against the PRCA, issuing a statement saying that they \\"concluded that it is better for them, the E.R.A. Tour and the sport of rodeo to avoid the distraction of an expensive and long legal battle with the P.R.C.A. for now.\\" According to the ERA, 85% of their shareholders chose to retain their ERA shares and sit out the PRCA season. The remaining 15% turned in their shares, but remained registered as ERA competitors. This allowed them to compete in both PRCA and ERA-sanctioned rodeos. Barrel racers were not affected, as the WPRA did not prohibit their members from holding financial interests in other rodeo associations. Several past world champions chose not to rejoin the PRCA, including Mote, Tuf Cooper, Kaycee Feild, and Luke Banquino. Among those giving up their shares were Junior Nogueira and Zeke Thurston, both of whom won world championships at the 2016 NFR. 2016 season The inaugural ERA season was loosely modeled on the PBR. Each of the eight stops on the tour would have two nights of rodeo. A $200,000 jackpot would be split among those who placed at each stop. The tour dates were scheduled for times when there were no large PRCA-sanctioned rodeos being held. At the end of the season there would be a five-day championship, with a purse of $3 million. Each rodeo would be televised by Fox Sports 2. Champions would be named based on the number of points they had garnered throughout the ERA season. The higher the level of competition at a rodeo, the more points a winner would earn. The ERA tour was committed to increasing the visibility of rodeo. Contestants held a one-hour meet-and-greet in the arena before each rodeo, allowing fans the opportunity for pictures. The first ERA rodeo was held in Redmond, Oregon on March 25 and 26. Other stops included Nampa, Idaho, West Valley City, Utah, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Sheridan, Wyoming. The Days of '47 Rodeo in Utah relinquished their PRCA sanctioning to become part of the ERA circuit. They structured the rodeo to all three days of qualification rounds. Selected cowboys would be invited to compete to join the ERA circuit. A fourth day of the rodeo showcased the ERA members and shareholders. The finale pit the top qualifiers against the winners of the ERA round. Guthrie Murray came through the qualifying rounds to win bull riding with an 87-point ride. Tyler Pearson had a 3.66 time to win steer wrestling. Team roping was won by Clay Tran and Jade Corkill, with a 3.72 time. In saddle bronc riding, Zeke Thurston took first with 87.5 points. Tuf Cooper won tie-down roping with a 6.84. Steven Peebles was named bareback riding champion with an 87.0-point score, and Chayni Chamberlain won barrel racing with 13.50 seconds. After ERA President, Tony Garritano left the organization, Mote became interim president. Attendance did not meet predictions. ERA organizers cancelled the last three planned rodeos, in St. Louis, Missouri, Atlanta, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana and trimmed the championship event from five days to three. Mote attributed the cancellations to growing pains, saying, \\"There are some things we assumed, and some we got right and some we got wrong, so we're adjusting based on what we've learned.\\" According to Mote, the organization had underestimated the extent to which urban dwellers could recognize the differing caliber of rodeo athletes. While audiences in many of the middle and small markets recognized the names of the champion rodeo competitors and wanted to follow them, those in larger markets saw no difference between champion-quality performances and regular rodeos. Furthermore, the ERA realized that they had mistimed some of the rodeos; they were more likely to fill the indoor arenas in the winter, when people were looking for activities indoors. Cowboys who had not been selected to join the ERA were able to earn their way into the ERA championships. The ERA partnered with the Mesquite Championship Rodeo in Mesquite, Texas. This rodeo held weekly events in a playoff-style format to choose two competitors in each discipline to go to the ERA championships. The championships were held in Dallas, Texas on November 11‚Äì13. They served as a qualifier to the 2017 The American. Team ropers Clay Tryan and Jade Corkill were named the champions for their event. They placed first in two of the three rounds, which gave them the most points for the year. In barrel racing, Kassie Mowry won all three rounds of the championship, but Lisa Lockhart was named world champion for having the most points on the season. Steven Dent was named bareback riding champion, Bray Armes became the steer wrestling champion, Cort Scheer won the title for saddle bronc riding, Shane Hanchey became champion of tie-down roping, and Chandler Bownds was named top bull rider. 2017 season The ERA had announced that the top 7 competitors in each event, according to 2016 point totals, would be invited to join the 2017 ERA Premier Tour. However, the ERA cancelled the 2017 season. Mote announced that this did not mean that the organization was folding. Instead, the ERA was taking more time to plan and organize. By leaving their schedule free for a year, it gave the competitors the chance to return temporarily to the PRCA to earn a living. The PRCA insisted that all applying for membership the 2017 season (which began in late 2016) sign an affidavit stating they held no financial interest in other rodeo associations. The WPRA followed the PRCA, refusing membership cards to ERA shareholders beginning in 2017. Although the ERA refused to comment on their membership, as of December 19, 2016, 43 ERA contestants, including Brazile, Branquino, and Cooper, had competed at a PRCA-sanctioned rodeo. World Champions Rodeo Alliance After the failure of the ERA, Bobby Mote, now retired from bareback bronc riding, got together with a group of fellow rodeo enthusiasts and formed the World Champions Rodeo Alliance (WCRA) in 2018, with Mote as its president.

Located just west of Downtown Hartford across Interstate 84, it includes four churches, a school, and a handful of adjacent 19th-century residences. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Asylum Avenue District is centered on a stretch of Sigourney Street, between Asylum and Farmington Avenues, both major arteries leading west from downtown Hartford. Extending east and west from that road are the institutional buildings that make up the heart of Asylum Hill. The northeastern corner of the district is marked by the Asylum Hill Congregational Church, a Gothic Revival brownstone built in 1865. It is a rare example of a Congregational church designed by Patrick C. Keely, most of whose work was for the Roman Catholic Church. At the southeastern corner is the Cathedral of St. Joseph, the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford. It was built in the early 1960s to a design by Eggers & Higgins in the International style, replacing a Gothic brownstone designed by Keely that was destroyed by fire. West of St. Joseph's stands the Trinity Episcopal Church, built in 1892 in the English Country Church style out of red brick. Across Sigourney Street from Trinity is the campus of the West Middle School, which includes a 1930 Georgian Revival building and an older Romanesque structure. At the northwestern corner of the district stands the Asylum Avenue Baptist Church, A Collegiate Gothic building built in 1931 on the site of an 1872 church. Between It and the Congregational Church are a row of fine houses dating to the mid-to-late 19th century Victorian period. Prior to its development in the mid-19th-century, the Asylum Hill area was mostly farmland owned by the locally prominent Goodwin family. Francis Goodwin was rector of Trinity Church, and some of the Goodwin land was purchased for the construction of St. Joseph's. The Baptist Church came about through the initiative of Jonathan Niles, for whom Niles Street is named.

It holds areas of tall grasses in flooded land, surrounded by mangroves and swamp forest, giving way to the drier Llanos savanna in the west. Location The Orinoco Wetlands ecoregion is in the northern Orinoco Delta in northeast Venezuela. They cover an area of . The wetlands adjoin or lie within the Orinoco Delta swamp forests. Near the coast they merge into the Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves. To the west they give way to the Llanos grasslands. The flooded grasslands of the Orinoco wetlands are found in seven separate patches north of the main Orinoco channel, surrounded by mangroves, swamp forest, moist forest and llanos. The main part is near Tucupita along the Ca√±o Manamo, the westernmost distributary of the Orinoco. The second largest patch is along the Ca√±o Macarao. To the north they are found along the Boca Grande and San Juan rivers, and in the alluvial fan at the mouth of the Amacuro River. There are other patches between the coastal mangroves and the swamp forests. Physical The terrain is flat, mostly about above sea level but rising to in levees along the coast. Soils are almost all alluvial deposits, carried from the Andes far to the west. The coastline of the delta moves east into the Atlantic ocean by about annually. The delta region has many large and small distributary rivers and streams, permanent wetlands and marshes, oxbow lakes, levees and alluvial plains. The region is sparsely inhabited apart from the small city of Tucupita on the edge of the region and small communities of Warao people along the rivers. Climate The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Average annual rainfall in different places varies from . The wet season usually lasts from April/May to December, with a period of less rain in July.

Yearly average temperatures range from a minimum of to a maximum of with a mean of . Annual rainfall averages . Monthly rainfall varies from in February to in July. Ecology The Orinoco wetlands are in the flooded grasslands and savannas biome. =Flora= Family of Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) The patches of wetlands are scattered through a landscape of swamp forests, mangroves, and llanos. Their central sections hold tropical tall flooded grasslands that contain very few shrubs or trees. The tall grasses include Lagenocarpus guianensis, Paspalum repens and species of the Jussieua, Mesosetum, Neptunia, and Rhynchospora genera. There are patches of palms among the grasses that include a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea), Manicaria saccifera, Attalea cuatrecasana and species of the Attalea and Trithrinax genera. In some areas there are stands of Mauritia flexuosa. Around the fringes the habitat holds plants from the surrounding mangroves, swamp forest and lowland forest. The grasslands are drier in the west and hold evergreen broadleaf trees. =Fauna= The stands of moriche palm (Mauritia flexuosa) are important sources of food for many species of primates, rodents and parrots, and are used by many birds for nesting. Threatened species include the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), jaguar (Panthera onca) , bush dog (Speothos venaticus), Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata), and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja). Endangered birds also include the yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". The Orinoco Delta as a whole is very susceptible to ecological damage, particularly the wetlands. Oil exploration and hydraulic engineering pose the main threats, and growing human presence is another concern, threatening the stocks of fish. The dam built on the Ca√±o Manamo in the 1960s to reduce flooding and allow cattle farming caused increased tidal action and salinity in the upper delta, with major impact on flora and fauna. The Guri Dam on the Caron√≠ River upstream also disrupts seasonal flooding. There are several conservation units that provide varying degrees of protection of the wetlands and other area, such as the Delta del Orinoco biosphere reserve, Turu√©pano National Park and Mariusa National Park.

Facilities  Flying Dollar Airport covers an area of 70 acres (28 ha) at a maximum elevation of 1,430 feet (436 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 2/20 with a turf surface measuring 2,405 by 100 feet (733 x 30.5 m). It is situated 8 NM northeast of Pocono Mountains Municipal Airport (KMPO) and 23 NM east of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (KAVP). West of the runway, there is a private residence and one steel hangar (60 x 60 feet), erected in the 1930s and since renovated with a one-piece hydraulic door and restored to its original checkerboard roof pattern, visible from the air.  Operations  The Pennsylvania Bureau of Aviation classifies the Flying Dollar Airport as a public basic utility airport suitable for operations in daytime visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. Its runway is considered moderately challenging due to a 4.5% gradient. The southern threshold of the runway is 1,322 feet MSL while the northern threshold is 1,430 feet MSL and abuts trees that are 94 feet high. Due to these conditions, landings on runway 20 and takeoffs on runway 02 are both prohibited. The field averages 21 operations a month, 100% single-engine, rotorcraft and ultra-light aircraft. Flying Dollar is particularly popular with powered parachutes and light sport aircraft, several of which form a local consortium called The Wing Nuts, who are based on the field and arrange biannual fly-ins.  History  In 1929, Barclay White and Raymond Price Sr., charter subscribers of nearby Skytop Lodge, formed a corporation and sold stock to finance the creation of what was then called Barrett Airport, buying farmland from local families adjacent to the Lodge for their site. The airfield was constructed in order to provide a means of regular air service to and from the Poconos and therefore to benefit Skytop Lodge, its membership, and the community at large. The airport was renamed the Flying Dollar Airport in 1971 by Ivan L. (\\"Ike\\") Battern, a Seaboard World Airlines pilot and its owner until his death in 2011. Battern's widow sold the airfield at auction in 2014, but it retains both its name and its status as a public basic utility airport. Flying Dollar is the oldest airport in the Pocono Mountains.

Early life and family  150px Clerk was born in Larteh in the Akuapem Mountains on 4 September 1909, where his father, Nicholas Timothy Clerk (1862 ‚Äì 1961) was stationed as a Basel missionary at the time. His father, a Basel-trained theologian, was the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1918 to 1932. N. T. Clerk was a founding father of the all boys‚Äô boarding high school, the Presbyterian Boys‚Äô Secondary School established in 1938. His mother, Anna Alice Meyer (1873 ‚Äì1934) was of Ga-Danish descent. His paternal grandfather, Alexander Worthy Clerk (1820 ‚Äì 1906), a Jamaican Moravian missionary arrived in the Danish Protectorate of Christiansborg (now the suburb of Osu) in 1843, as part of the original group of 24 West Indian missionaries who worked under the auspices of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society of Basel, Switzerland. A.W. Clerk was a pioneer of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana and a leader in education in colonial Ghana, establishing a middle boarding school, the Salem School in 1843. His paternal grandmother, Pauline Hesse (1831‚Äì1909) was from the Gold Coast, and was of Danish, Ga and German descent. Theodore Clerk's grandaunt was Regina Hesse (1832 ‚Äì1898), a pioneer educator and school principal. T. S. Clerk had eight other siblings and was a member of the historically important Clerk family. His older brother, Carl Henry Clerk (1895 ‚Äì 1982) was an editor, agricultural educationist and church minister who served as the fourth Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1950 to 1954 as well as the Editor of the Christian Messenger newspaper between 1960 and 1963. Among his sisters were Jane E. Clerk (1904 ‚Äì 1999), a pioneering woman education administrator along with Matilda Johanna Clerk (1916 ‚Äì 1984), the second Ghanaian female medical doctor and the first Ghanaian woman in any field to be awarded an academic merit scholarship for university education abroad.  Education and training  150px T. S. Clerk attended Basel Mission primary schools in Larteh Akuapem, the boys' boarding middle school, the Salem School at Osu and had his secondary education at Achimota School, as a member of one of the institution's earliest generations of students. He also took draughtsmanship or technical drawing lessons at the then Achimota College Engineering School where he was taught by Charles Deakin. At Achimota, Clerk's contemporaries included Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president, R. P. Baffour, the first Vice-Chancellor of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) as well as Charles Odamtten Easmon, the first Ghanaian surgeon. Clerk secured a government scholarship for a diploma course in architecture at the Edinburgh College of Art, a constituent college of the University of Edinburgh where he attended from October 1938 to June 1943. Records of his nomination for admission to the professional associations for architecture and town planning suggest that he also completed a diploma in town planning in 1944. Theodore Clerk's nomination papers are housed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. During the Easter term of 1941, Clerk was in Manchester on a vacation scholarship and later that summer in 1941, he undertook measuring work for the Scottish branch of the National Buildings Record. In the summer of 1942, he carried out a housing survey assignment for the Department of Health for Scotland. Theodore Clerk passed the intermediate examination in June 1941 and the final examination in June 1943, and was admitted as an associate (ARIBA) by the Royal Institute of British Architects on 1 October 1943, with Frank Charles Mears, Leslie Grahame Thomson and John Ross McKay listed as his proposers. Furthermore, Clerk was also an Associate Member of the Royal Town Planning Institute (AMTPI).  Career  T. S. Clerk welcoming Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to Tema during the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ghana, 1961 In the summer of 1943, Clerk was awarded the Rutland Prize by the Royal Scottish Academy; an award which facilitated a critical study and tour of the Building Research Station in Garston and the Forest Products Research Lab in Princes Risborough, in addition to analysing the architecture, housing and town planning in London, Leeds, Liverpool and Coventry. He joined the Town and Country Planning Department in Accra in 1946 and was later transferred to its Sekondi office from 1948 to 1953. For a time, Clerk was the only Ghanaian architect in the country and later, one of three Ghanaian architects in the late 1950s. He had been appointed the Chief Architect and Town Planner in the parastatal, Tema Development Corporation by 1954. By 1960, he had led the design, urban planning and development of the post-independent port city of Tema, a project commissioned by Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah. In planning the first three Communities at Tema, Theodore Clerk led a team of English architects to design affordable, middle class, standard houses, with four out of every five houses reserved for industrial workers, especially, low-income dockworkers at the harbour, who were facing a housing shortage at the time. The British architects who worked under Clerk were D. C. Robinson, D. Gillies-Reyburn, N. R. Holman, M. J. Hirst, W. D. Ferguson, C. Kossack, G. Rochford, D. B. Duck and H. G. Herbert. T. S. Clerk later became the first chief executive officer (CEO) of the Tema Development Corporation when an Act of Parliament, the Tema Development Corporation Act was passed in 1963, making the institution a publicly owned corporate entity. Theodore Clerk was also an external examiner at the Department of Architecture of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). Sometime in 1963, a group of about fifteen mostly British and American-trained Ghanaian architects came together to streamline the architectural practice, education and accreditation through a professional body, the Ghana Institute of Architects (GIA) as the successor of the pre- independence Gold Coast Society of Architects, a colonial social club for Gold Coast-based architects founded in August 1954. These architects were T. S. Clerk, D.K. Dawson, J.S.K. Frimpong, P.N.K., Turkson, J. Owusu-Addo, O.T. Agyeman, A. K. Amartey, E.K. Asuako, W.S. Asamoah, M. Adu-Donkor, K.G. Kyei, C. Togobo, V. Adegbite, M. Adu Bedu and E. Kingsley Osei. On Friday 11 December 1964 at 8:30 p.m., the inauguration of the body took place at the University of Ghana, Legon, where T. S. Clerk was elected the first president of the Ghana Institute of Architects, after which he gave his inaugural speech. Theodore Clerk also authored the first constitution of the Ghana Institute of Architects. T. S. Clerk had previously served as the president of the erstwhile Gold Coast Society of Architects during the British colonial era. He was later reassigned to the Ghanaian presidency by Kwame Nkrumah, to be his presidential advisor.  Personal life  On 20 March 1948, Theodore Clerk married Paulina Quist, a midwife from Christiansborg, Accra, at the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu. Quist was the daughter of Emmanuel Charles Quist (1880 ‚Äì 1959), a barrister and judge who became the first African President of the Legislative Council from 1949 to 1951, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Gold Coast from 1951 to 1957, and Speaker of the National Assembly of Ghana from March 1957 to November 1957. Clerk belonged to the District Grand Lodge of Ghana under the United Grand Lodge of England. T. S. Clerk was an organist and also served as a Presbyter and the Choir President of the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu.  Death and legacy  Clerk died in 1965 of complications relating to stomach cancer. T. S. Clerk's funeral service was held at the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu and his remains were buried at Accra's Osu Cemetery, previously known as Christiansborg Civil Cemetery. The Ghanaian government named a street in Tema, T.S. Clerk Street, between Akojo School Park and Tweduaase Primary School at Site 6 of Community I, in his honour, in appreciation of his pioneering services to the development of Ghana.

From 1997 to 2017, Krewson served as the alderman of St. Louis's 28th ward.About Lyda Krewson Early life Born on November 14, 1953, near Davenport, Iowa, Krewson moved with her family to St. Joseph, Missouri, then Fairfield, Illinois, before settling in Moberly, Missouri, where she graduated from high school. In 1974 she earned a degree in psychology and a special education minor from Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman State). Krewson then moved to St. Louis, where she earned an accounting degree at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. In 1988 she married Jeff Krewson, an architect. He was murdered by a criminal on parole in an attempted carjacking in front of their Central West End house in 1995; she and their two young children were also in the car. The killer was later sentenced to life without parole. In 1998, Krewson married local news anchor Mike Owens. Krewson is a Certified Public Accountant. She worked for Deloitte for 7 years, then served as the Chief Financial Officer of PGAV, an international design and planning firm. Political career While alderman of St. Louis's 28th ward, Krewson took out a home equity loan in 2003 to help fund an unsuccessful campaign against Missouri's concealed carry law, which passed. In 2011, she led the city's successful effort to pass a smoking ban. Krewson served as the Chairman of the Board of Aldermen's Transportation & Commerce Committee. Previously she served as the chairman of the Ways & Means, Convention & Tourism, and Parks & Environment committees. Results of the mayoral election by ward With the retirement of four-term mayor Francis Slay, Krewson entered a crowded seven-way 2017 Democratic primary, the real contest in this heavily Democratic city (St. Louis has not elected a Republican mayor since 1949). She won the March 7 primary against Tishaura Jones, Lewis E. Reed, Antonio French, and others with 32% of the vote, just 879 votes ahead of Jones. In the general election on April 4, she defeated Republican candidate Andrew Jones with 67% of the vote, becoming the first female chief executive in the city's history. She took office on April 18. = Panhandling and homelessness = Krewson worked to reduce panhandling in the Central West End (CWE) neighborhood by introducing the REAL Change Program, which encourages social services for those in need. The program was attached to an ordinance to criminalize panhandling. During the 2017 mayoral campaign, The St. Louis American criticized the program, arguing that Krewson did not understand the factors behind poverty and homelessness. A legal battle initiated by Francis Slay's administration against Larry Rice's New Life Evangelistic Center homeless shelter came to a close in April 2017, early in Krewson's mayoralty, allowing the city to close the shelter, which provided temporary housing for up to 150 people. The city-owned Biddle House shelter expanded to provide beds for 50 more people. At least two people died in the streets without housing the following winter. = Crime prevention = In August 2019, Krewson agreed to sponsor a one-year contract with Cure Violence in response to community pressure and an increased city murder rate. Previous measures from Krewson's administration had focused on increasing policing, while Cure Violence trains civilians in crisis intervention and community based solutions. Aldermanic President Lewis E. Reed told reporters that he supported additional funding for the program. In April, Comptroller Darlene Green raised the issue of the local medium-security prison known as the St Louis Workhouse causing violence, advocating that Krewson move to close it. Advocates and activists have campaigned for the Workhouse's closure, citing inhumane conditions and criminalization of poverty. The city was sued in 2017 after people incarcerated in the Workhouse were heard screaming for help during a heat wave and large protests were staged outside the fence. The city responded by installing temporary air conditioning units. = Facebook Live controversy = In a public briefing broadcast live on Facebook on June 26, 2020, Krewson read aloud the names and addresses of multiple constituents, including a minor, who had signed a petition in favor of budgetary changes that involved redirecting all the money spent on the police department to social services, affordable housing and Cure Violence. She apologized later that day and removed the post after protesters showed up at her house. The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri released a statement condemning her actions, saying \\"[i]t serves no apparent purpose beyond intimidation.\\" After the Facebook Live incident, local activist and drag performer Maxi Glamour created a petition calling for Krewson's resignation that collected more than 30,000 signatures in two days. 500 Black Lives Matter protesters marched to Krewson's home to demand her resignation, the closure of St. Louis Workhouse, and defunding of the Metropolitan Police Department, City of St. Louis. On the way to her home, the protesters traveled through the Central West End neighborhood and took a shortcut through a private gated community, Portland Place. When protesters entered the private street through a gate, there was a confrontation between them and the residents of the adjacent house, the residents of which brandished a rifle and handgun.

He left without taking a degree. He came under the influence of Richard Conyers in Deptford, where he stayed with his cousin. Taking a post as usher in a school in Wandsworth, he was persuaded to think of the Anglican ministry. Gunn was ordained in 1783, by Brownlow North, and became a curate at the parish of Chobham and Bisley. From 1788 he was curate at Odiham. In 1786 he was appointed preacher at Farnham. He lost this post in 1792, the vicar objecting to his approach, and there was a secession from the Farnham church.Michael Hopkins, When was Farnham United Reformed Church Formed?, Journal of the United Reformed Church History Society Volume 8 No 2 May 2008 (PDF) at p. 3 Moving to London, Gunn was lecturer at St Mary Somerset with St Mary Mounthaw, from 1793. He came into the orbit of John Newton, a significant influence, at St Mary Woolnoth. Newton tried in 1795 to bring him to St Helen's Bishopsgate, but failed, because of local resistance. In 1796 Gunn became Newton's curate at St Mary Woolnoth. Newton found Gunn both popular with his congregation and humble; but noted that Gunn was even more unpopular with the wider clergy than evangelicals generally were. Joseph Irons, father of William Josiah Irons, who became an itinerant preacher, was converted by Gunn's preaching, around 1803. Another impressed by Gunn was Jacob Kirkman Foster, who became a Cheshunt College tutor. An opponent took the chance to criticise Gunn for his use of snuff.

Quality assurance and accreditation: a glossary of basic terms and de nitions. Bucharest, UNESCO Centre Europ√©en pour l‚ÄôEnseignement Sup√©rieur (CEPES). http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001346/134621e.pdf In this context, level refers to the level at which the outcomes of learning are allocated through the use of descriptors which constitute an integral component of qualifications frameworks internationally. Learning level descriptors are an integral part of qualifications frameworks regionally, nationally, and globally, but also consider how the level of learning is determined in other contexts, such as longitudinal studies, international competence assessments and diagnostic reviews. Learning level descriptors vary across qualifications frameworks, and understanding the similarities and differences is the first step in establishing world reference levels for learning.  Formulation  Descriptors are formulated using learning outcomes language, yet they are divided into different domains based on specific contextual decisions. These domains are mostly referred to as sets of like competences which describe progression across the levels.  Setting levels through level descriptors  All types of qualifications frameworks use level descriptors based on learning outcomes, to define a set of hierarchical levels across a series of domains. The hierarchy of level descriptors is purposefully developed to allow for alignment of qualifications: \\"Each of these unique learning outcome terms is defined in statements of knowledge, skill and competence. They are assembled in vertical strands for each framework level. The use of strands of learning outcomes and levels in a qualifications framework helps improve the hierarchical and distinguishing characteristics applicable between levels as well as within a level. It provides those designing qualifications with a finely drawn vertical and horizontal structure (grid) to facilitate easy alignment.\\"NQAUAE. 2012. Qualifications Framework Emirates Handbook. Abu Dhabi, NQAUAE. Qualifications are compared against the level descriptors and pegged at a particular level of a qualifications framework. To be more specific, the learning outcomes contained within a qualification are compared with the learning outcomes listed in the level descriptors. P. 49-51  Criticism  The pragmatic approach that underlies the current understandings of level descriptors has resulted in a weak theoretical model that will take many years to be improved. While level descriptors may be important to standards developers, stakeholders are interested in levels, not level descriptors. Level descriptors are sometimes criticized for being too broad and generic to be applicable to a specific qualification from a specific sector. The defense has been that level descriptors are not an exact science, but only provide guidance with regard to levels.

A suit claimed the district had been racially gerrymandered to give an advantage to white Republicans. The ruling in that case found that the General Assembly in 2012 unconstitutionally packed too many black voters into Bobby Scott's district, weakening the clout of blacks in nearby districts. This ruling allowed Democrat Donald McEachin to represent the 4th District in the newly convened U.S. House of Representatives. House of Delegates districts Delegate Mark L. Cole noted that even without gerrymandering, political polarization will exist because of the stark political differences between urban and rural areas, which makes drawing competitive districts impossible in some regions of the state. On 1 March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court sent a case involving 12 Virginia House of Delegates districts back to a lower court to rule on 11 of those districts. Richmond Circuit Court Judge W. Reilly Marchant ruled that the constitutionality of the map was \\"fairly debatable\\" and therefore upheld it.https://www.apnews.com/5f7a8115ccbc4c598db0fecdc138d1d7 In June 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found that the 11 districts unconstitutionally concentrated black voters, depriving them of representation. The Court gave the Virginia legislature until October 30, 2018 to submit a new map, but the Republican-majority Assembly was unable to agree on a map that would also be supported by Democratic Governor Ralph Northam, and the Court instead appointed University of California, Irvine political science professor Bernard Grofman to serve as special master to oversee the redistricting process.

In 2011, the Virginia College and University Redistricting Competition was organized by Professors Michael McDonald of George Mason University and Quentin Kidd of Christopher Newport University. About 150 students on sixteen teams from thirteen schools submitted plans for legislative and U.S. Congressional Districts. They created districts more compact than the General Assembly's efforts. The \\"Division 1\\" maps conformed with the Governor's Executive Order, and did not address electoral competition or representational fairness. In addition to the criteria of contiguity, equipopulation, the federal Voting Rights Act and communities of interest in the existing city and county boundaries, \\"Division 2\\" maps in the competition did incorporate considerations of electoral competition and representational fairness. Judges for the cash award prizes were Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute.The Public Interest in Redistricting Bob Holsworth, Chair for the Independent Bipartisan Advisory Commission on Redistricting, Commonwealth of Virginia, April 1, 2011, p.9-10 In January 2015, Republican State Senator Jill Holtzman Vogel of Winchester and Democratic State Senator Louise Lucas of Portsmouth sponsored a Senate Joint Resolution to establish additional criteria for the Virginia Redistricting Commission of four identified members of political parties, and three other independent public officials. The criteria began with respecting existing political boundaries, such as cities and towns, counties and magisterial districts, election districts and voting precincts. Districts are to be established on the basis of population, in conformance with federal and state laws and court cases, including those addressing racial fairness.

Virginia State Board of Elections in a Virginia state court, plaintiffs sought to overturn the General Assembly's redistricting in five House of Delegate and six state Senate districts as violations of both the Virginia and U.S. Constitutions because they failed to represent populations in \\"continuous and compact territory\\".Vesilind v. Virginia State Board of Elections, viewed October 7, 2016 The Virginia General Assembly passed HJ 615 in 2019 and SJ 18 in 2020 to amend the state constitution to form a redistricting commission for the 2021 redistricting process. In accordance with Virginia's process for amending the state constitution, this proposed amendment had to pass through the General Assembly in two, concurrent years before being passed on to Virginia voters, who will vote on this referendum in November 2020. The amendment, if added to the Virginia Constitution, will create a sixteen-member commission, composed of eight citizens, two Senate Democrats, two Senate Republicans, two House Democrats, and two House Republicans, to redistrict Virginia, instead of the General Assembly. It will also cement requirements for commission transparency and historic civil rights protections for racial and ethnic minorities in the Virginia Constitution. If the commission cannot agree or if the General Assembly rejects the commission's map twice, the Virginia Supreme Court will redraw the districts in accordance with existing standard, likely with the help of a Special Master.

The objective of the ArgoMoon mission is to provide NASA information about the correct launch vehicle operations through photography. At the time the second stage will release the CubeSats, it will not be able to communicate with the ground anymore. Flying ArgoMoon in the Artemis-1 mission will also be the opportunity to test nanotechnology in the hostile environment of deep space.

History The space capsule Orion MPCV is the Artemis 1 primary payload. The main focus of the Artemis 1 mission is demonstrating the SLS and Orion operations. Orion will be injected by the SLS in a translunar trajectory and it will orbit the Moon, testing the capsule operations according to a future crewed mission path. The absence of cargo opened the opportunity for several low-mass CubeSats (a class of nanosatellites) to be included in the mission as secondary payloads. In September 2015 NASA opened an invitation to tender to take part in the mission with the design of 13 nanosatellites (6U, according to the CubeSat standards). Among the proposals evaluated by the Italian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, and finally NASA, the Argotec proposal was one of the selected spacecraft. ArgoMoon will be the only European satellite to participate in the mission.\\"The final three CubeSats for EM-1 have been announced\\". 2 June 2016.NASA firms up Space Launch System nanosat manifest.27 May 2016. Retrieved 6 April 2017.The Register: NASA firms up Space Launch System nanosat manifest. The Register. 27 May 2016.  Objectives  According to the SLS documents that NASA attached to the call, Argotec engineers noticed the inability of the second stage of the launcher to send telemetry during a CubeSat release phase, which occurs a few hours after the release of the primary payload: the Orion capsule. It was this issue that triggered the proposal of a satellite capable out of performing a proximity flight with the release vehicle to take photographs and providing an inspection to confirm the success of operations. Before being injected into a heliocentric orbit because of the lunar flyby, ArgoMoon will perform a propulsive maneuver to close in a geocentric orbit. The second part of the mission will last a few months up to the natural decay of the satellite. During these months, the satellite will collect telemetry validating the nanotechnology on board the platform in the hostile environment of deep space. Up to now, CubeSats were mainly targeted to Earth observation missions, where the satellite are naturally shielded from radiation by the Earth magnetic field.  Satellite configuration  ArgoMoon will have a hybrid propulsion system, monopropellant and cold gas thrusters, to provide attitude control (orientation) and orbital maneuvering.ArgoMoon Propulsion systems. VACCO Propulsion Systems. 2017. * Primary propulsion: for orbit maintenance during the proximity flight and for a change of the orbit to avoid the lunar flyby; * Secondary propulsion: as actuator for attitude control law, since the satellite is too far from the Earth to use the Earth's magnetic field. Another peculiarity of ArgoMoon is the use of radiation-resistant components. The absence of the protection provided by the magnetosphere requires the selection of components that have been designed and tested to withstand radiation. In order to provide detailed photographs of the mission, ArgoMoon is equipped with a narrow field of view camera to acquire inspection photography. This optical payload is supported by another one with wide field of view to provide images to the onboard computer where an imaging software process them in order to perform autonomous navigation and target fine pointing.  Project and development  In September 2015 Argotec delivered the ArgoMoon proposal to NASA. The proposal was reviewed and approved by ASI, ESA and then by NASA. The project is coordinated by the Italian Space Agency and the satellite launch is planned as a secondary payload of the Artemis 1 mission. Argotec engineers worked in the definition of the mission objectives and phases, the mission analysis, and the configuration of the satellite. The electrical power subsystem, the on-board computer, and the on-board software are designed and developed by Argotec as well, including the imaging software for target recognition and pointing.

The advertisement was pulled after receiving online backlash, with Pepsi and Jenner being accused of trivializing Black Lives Matter and police brutality. Description The commercial features Kendall Jenner (pictured in 2014). The Pepsi commercial features American fashion model and television personality Kendall Jenner and the song \\"Lions\\" by Skip Marley. The ad begins silently with a person's hand cracking open a Pepsi can and then a shot of a young man playing a cello on a rooftop. The view pans backward on a city and then zooms in on the musician with sweat flying off of his face as he plays. The music soundtrack then begins, with no other sound accompanying the visual footage. The view switches to a protest with mostly young people walking displaying V signs as gestures of peace and carrying signs, including one that says \\"Join the Conversation\\" and others with peace symbols. The view then switches to a young woman in a hijab, who appears to be a professional photographer going through her print photographs with a red marker. Then the view switches to Jenner's character, clad in a silver dress being photographed in a photo shoot, modeling but also showing a growing awareness of the protesters passing nearby. The cellist, shown indoors in a new location, notices the protest as well, then drinks a Pepsi while viewing passing marchers from a balcony. Below the balcony, two young women drink a Pepsi. Then two other women take selfies as the march passes behind them. The view then switches to the photographer, growing frustrated and then sending her prints flying in a gesture of irritation. She then also notices the protest outside. The view then switches to the protesters, looking cheerful. The photographer looks captivated, grabs her camera, and heads outside toward the protesters. There are images of more young people marching, then the cellist playing music alongside a guitarist as two men dance. Jenner's character is shown again, still modeling but increasingly focusing on the protest. The cellist passes her, and gestures with his head for her to join them. Jenner responds by pulling off her blond wig to reveal her dark brown hair, cutting to a shot of her hair being blown forward. She hands the wig to a black woman assistant without looking at her, wipes off her dark lipstick, and heads toward the protest. The camera then shows several police officers standing rigidly watching the protest, then two young protesters, then two men - one in a religious robe - and a woman, several of these characters displaying V signs. Jenner, now in a more casual outfit, passes swiftly through the crowd and advances toward the police officers. She hands a Pepsi can to one of the police officers, as the photographer, looking riveted, snaps multiple photographs of the interaction. The police officer drinks from the can, and the crowd of protesters cheers enthusiastically. The photographer puts aside her camera and hugs a protester in celebration. The commercial ends displaying the phrases \\"Live Bolder\\", \\"Live Louder\\", and \\"Live for Now\\". Reaction The advertisement was pulled by the company one day after its distribution due to criticism. The company released a statement, saying: > Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and > understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize. We did not > intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and > halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in > this position. The advertisement's creators have been widely criticized on social media and by media outlets for attempting to capitalize on imagery imitating protests in the Black Lives Matter movement, including Taking a Stand in Baton Rouge, the iconic image of a woman, named Iesha Evans, who approached heavily armed police alone and was arrested in a Baton Rouge protest in July 2016. Researchers of branding and marketing have observed the identity politics aspect of the spot depicted by the marching masses, but questioned the credibility of subverting the police towards a \\"melting pot\\" model. Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr, remarked, \\"If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi\\". Initially, Pepsi stated, \\"This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony, and we think that's an important message to convey\\". According to marketing expert Mike Jackson, part of the problem was that Pepsi did not have a history of promoting social justice causes. The advertisement was parodied in a YouTube video by comedian Vito Gesualdi, who filmed himself handing out cans of Pepsi at an April 15, 2017, protest in Berkeley, California. Gesualdi stated he was trying to \\"bridge the divide\\" in America with cans of Pepsi; however, almost all the cans distributed ended up being used as projectiles by the protesters. The advertisement was also parodied in a pre-registration trailer for the mobile game Angry Birds Evolution, with a blue bird named Paige and a member of the Bacon Corp's own security force replacing Jenner and the police officer, respectively. Saturday Night Live made reference to the commercial in a sketch for the April 8, 2017 episode, where the ad's writer and director, played by Beck Bennett, is being chastised for the ad's content by family and friends on the phone just before filming; however, when Jenner (Cecily Strong) discusses the commercial with her friends on the phone, she astutely (albeit unintentionally) explains the true nature of the commercial's plot.

It was released online by BBC Three on 26 November 2016. The episode was written by series creator Patrick Ness and directed by Wayne Che Yip; it acts as a companion piece to the previous episode \\"Detained\\", also written by Ness and directed by Che Yip. Class follows four students of Coal Hill Academy and their alien teacher, as they deal with various alien threats. The episode takes place concurrently with \\"Detained\\", following Miss Quill's (Katherine Kelly) perspective instead of the students'; in it, Quill goes on a journey with headteacher Dorothea (Pooky Quesnel) and a shapeshifting alien named Ballon (Chik√© Okonkwo) in an attempt to remove the Arn from her brain, which would free her from Charlie's (Greg Austin) authority. Unlike all other Class episodes in which she is credited last in the main cast, Kelly receives first billing credit in the end credits, due to the other main cast members having little screen time in the episode. The episode received very positive reviews from critics, who praised its performances (most notably Kelly's), characters, themes and visuals.  Plot  Having left the students in detention, Miss Quill joins headteacher Dorothea Ames, who promised to help her remove the creature known as the \\"Arn\\" forcing her to obey Charlie's authority. They are joined by Ballon, an alien kept prisoner by the Governors whose shapeshifting abilities have been frozen. The three travel using a metaphysical engine that can transport them to recreations or \\"ideas\\" of any place, as long as this place is \\"believed in\\". During their travels, they find an Arn specimen to study, obtain the blood of the \\"Devil\\" (to unfreeze Ballon's shapeshifting abilities so that he can perform surgery on Quill), and obtain the brain of a Quill goddess to study before returning to Coal Hill. Ballon performs the surgery and removes the Arn, leaving Quill's face and eye scarred but setting her free. Having bonded and developed feelings during their journey, the two rejoice about their success and have sex, but eventually realize that they are in fact in the Cabinet of Souls, before being told by a hologram of Dorothea that the Governors never intended to let both of them return to Earth alive, and that there is only enough energy for one else to return. Having no choice, Quill and Ballon fight each other; Ballon eventually appears victorious, having grabbed the gun left by Ames and aiming it at Quill, who accepts her death, but when he reluctantly fires, the weapon fires at him instead, killing him and leaving Quill in shock and grief. Having escaped the Cabinet, Quill finally returns to the students (tying in with the events at the end of \\"Detained\\"). As time pases differently inside the Cabinet, it has been only 45 minutes for them, but an entire day for her; additionally, her body has grown several months older. She saves Charlie and reveals that she is now free of the Arn. After she passes out from exhaustion, Charlie and Matteusz realize that she is several months pregnant.  Continuity  * In the episode, when learning that Ballon is a shapeshifter, Quill believes him at first to be a Zygon. Dorothea explains that Zygons are \\"protected on Earth\\", a reference to the peace treaty between humans and Zygons leaving on Earth negotiated by the Tenth, Eleventh and War Doctors in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013). =Outside references= * Quill recalls an unnamed \\"Earth poem\\"; said poem is \\"Home\\" by Warsan Shire.  Production  The episode was directed by Wayne Che Yip, who also directed the preceding episode, \\"Detained\\". It premiered on 26 November 2016 at 10am. The episode was broadcast in the United States in early 2017 on BBC America.  Reception  The episode received very positive reviews from critics, who praised its performances, pacing, visuals, and character development. Kelly's performance and her character's journey, in particular, were highly praised. The A.V. Club called the episode \\"brilliant\\" and \\"the best example yet of the show‚Äôs wild inventiveness\\", highly praising its adult themes and characters. Vodzilla praised the performances of Kelly, Quesnel and Okonkwo, and the \\"imaginative world-building and character development\\", and calling it \\"the most vivid and ambitious episode of Class to date\\". Cult Box gave a positive review, praising Kelly's performance, Quill's character, and the visuals, stating that \\"the succession of contrasting locales were a treat\\". Den of Geek gave a very positive review, praising Quill's character development, Kelly's performance, the writing and themes, and special effects. Stating that \\"the concurrent- episodes structure worked a treat\\", they felt that \\"what started out looking like a fun, straight-up adventure game [...] quickly pivoted into an intense exploration of character and the philosophy of liberty. As a result, the character of Quill became much more than an enjoyably sardonic warrior who does a good line in quips. She raged, empathised, grieved, challenged her existential beliefs and rediscovered her person-hood. Class stuffed a whole series‚Äô worth of character development into forty-five gripping minutes. By so doing, it cemented its own identity as a brainy series with more ideas than you can shake a metaphysical stick at.\\" Flickering Myth gave a very positive review, praising the writing and Kelly's \\"wonderfully acerbic yet vulnerable performance\\". They felt that \\"there‚Äôs a real depth of textuality to ‚ÄòThe Metaphysical Engine‚Äô, which demonstrates a lot of Patrick Ness‚Äô greatest strengths as a writer\\" and that the writing was \\"both entertaining and thought provoking\\". Mym Buzz gave a positive review, calling the episode \\"a gloriously entertaining mess\\" and \\"a fine, pacy, unpredictable, great-looking and unashamedly geeky piece of small screen sci-fi\\". They praised the visuals, Kelly and Quesnel's performances and its \\"interesting\\" themes, but felt that \\"a few elements felt underdeveloped and poorly explained\\". Conversely, Doctor Who TV gave a mixed review, feeling that the episode failed to develop Quill further and criticized the lack of emotional investment in the episode, due to Quill herself being \\"barely invested in her adventure, as she is scripted with an overabundance of witty retorts [...] Unfortunately, rather than reveal Quill‚Äôs true, inner nature via her reactions to the episode‚Äôs impossible situations, writer Patrick Ness fills the script with Quill‚Äôs acerbic humor [...] This episode needed to reveal the layers of Quill‚Äôs character hidden underneath her bitterly sarcastic exterior, but the script‚Äôs reliance on one- liners do the titular character few favors.\\" References Class episodes 2016 British television episodes ","title":"The Metaphysical Engine, or What Quill Did"},{"id":"53706258","text":"Prince Kashemsanta Sobhaga, the Prince Phromwaranurak (; ; 18 August 1856 - 4 January 1924) was a Prince of Siam (later Thailand a member of Siamese royal family and a member House of Kashemsanta is a son of King Mongkut of Siam.

Hon. Caroline, Countess of Seafield Caroline Stuart, Countess of Seafield (30 June 1830 ‚Äì 6 October 1911), styled The Countess Dowager from 1884 to 1911, was a member of the Scottish aristocracy. She was proprietor of the Seafield EstatesSee: http://www.seafield-estate.co.uk - accessed April 2017 following the death of her son in 1884 and has been described as 'The last of the great feudal chiefs'. Genealogy John Charles and Ian Charles Ogilvy-Grant. The Honourable Caroline Henrietta Stuart was the youngest child of Robert Walter, 11th Lord Blantyre, of the family of the Stuarts of Minto. Accessed (2017) via archive.org. Aged 20, on 12 August 1850 she married John Charles Ogilvy-Grant who, then styled Lord Reidhaven and Master of Grant, was heir to the Seafield and Findlater estates. Their only child, Ian Charles was born 7 October 1851. On 30 July 1853 John Charles succeeded his father as Earl of Seafield and Chief of the Clan Grant. Her husband and son were to die within a few years of each other: Lord Seafield on 18 February 1881 and Ian Charles on 31 March 1884. As he was unmarried and had no children, by a will made c.1882 Ian Charles left his mother as the heir to his estates. Taking the style of The Countess Dowager, Lady Seafield was proprietor of the Seafield and Grant Estates until her death. Meanwhile the 8th Earl's titles of honour were inherited by his uncle, James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield who was otherwise the nearest male heir. The Seafield title was thus for some generations separated from the lands and properties that had maintained it. This situation had been made possible because the 7th Earl, John Charles, had completed the legal procedure of disentailing the estate. Lady Seafield died on 6 October 1911. Her funeral was held on 12 October. Her coffin rests, with those of her husband and son, in the Seafield Mausoleum in the Duthil Old Parish Church and Churchyard. As Countess of Seafield In the section 'Public and Social Work' in the tribute volume published after her death, the editors highlighted Lady Seafield's support for her husband's direction of his estates. Mention was made of her interest in his patronage of individuals via appointments in the established church and through educational bursaries, for his programme of afforestation and: 'in general improvements effected throughout the estate, his lordship had always the affectionate advice and warm interest of the Countess'. She was, though, primarily a social hostess: > The Earl and Countess spent usually a portion of every spring in London, but > the rest of the year was passed between Cullen House, Castle Grant, and > Balmacaan (in Glen Urquhart). For Balmacaan they had an especial affection > It was the place where they had spent the early years of their married life > and every time they returned to it with renewed pleasure. At each of their > residences they entertained select parties of guests, and in no sphere did > the Countess of Seafield more winningly display her gracious gifts of manner > than as the bright, polished and vivacious hostess of guests who were under > the roof-tree of the Chieftain of the Clan Grant. As Countess Dowager of Seafield After the deaths of John Charles and Ian Charles, Lady Seafield's priorities as Countess Dowager, besides overseeing the management of her estates, were to 'take steps for the perpetuation of (her son's) memory and that of her husband in schemes of enduring utility'. The first of these was a public hospital for Strathspey, named the Ian Charles Hospital in his memory: > Thus, fifteen months after his death, in May 1885 there was opened at > Grantown-on-Spey the Ian Charles Hospital. The erection and endowment of > such a hospital had been arranged by the Countess Dowager and her son. It > had been little more than founded when the Earl died, and his sorrowing > mother brought the undertaking to a completion. All who know the capital of > Strathspey know the place well.... The hospital was and is fitted with all > necessary conveniences and comforts for the treatment and care of the sick, > and has been of untold benefit to the Speyside district of the Seafield > estates. In addition the Dowager Countess had the Church of Scotland parish church of Inverallan, located in Grantown-on-Spey, rebuilt by her architect: she laid the memorial stone on 1 May 1886 on the occasion of the dedication of the building for worship. Memorial tablets to her husband and son were presented to this and all the other parishes churches within the estate. Other biographical headings from the memorial Tribute are: * Head of a Great Estate * Lady Seafield and Fishing Interests * Religious and Philanthropic Work * A Gracious Hostess * Lady Seafield and the (Armed) Services * Chieftainess of Clan Grant * Some Public Activities Assessments * James Cameron, the Duthil author, writing in 1899: > Lady Seafield has the credit of being one of the most exemplary, the most > liberal, the most charitable and generous, both as an individual and as a > proprietrix north side of the Grampians, if not in a wider circle. In this > respect she stands in the first rank of women. * Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, remembering his childhood holidays in Strathspey in My Scottish Youth: > She settled down at Castle Grant and Cullen to devote the rest of her life > to good works. She carried out her duties as a great landowner and as > chieftain of Clan Grant with scrupulous attention to detail. She visited all > her tenants regularly, and, by patting their children on the head and > listening to their troubles, identified herself with their lives. ... > Undoubtedly she was imperious, regarding her wishes as law throughout her > domains. (And yet) By the vast majority of tenants she was loved with much > the same veneration and pride that the British public lavished on Queen > Victoria. She was the last of the great feudal chiefs. * Lord Strathspey, in his A History of Clan Grant (1983) wrote that, while 'She had enormous power in her lifetime', by the time she died 'very few of the inhabitants actually knew her at all, since she did not go round much.' He did give credit, however, to her management of the estates: 'During her life she kept the estates intact and tried to pay off the debt, which, in fact, she nearly succeeding in doing - an achievement much to her credit.' Lord Strathspey was particularly critical of the Countess Dowager's policy of keeping at a long distance those who inherited her son's titles of honour: James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield, Francis William Ogilvy-Grant, 10th Earl of Seafield and James Ogilvy-Grant, 11th Earl of Seafield. 'All family contacts with her ... were through her law agent. Through him she sent various members of the family periodic small remittances ... and they were, it would thus appear, paid to keep away.' Lady Seafield and the Seafield Mausoleum, Duthil After Duthil Parish Church was reconstructed in the 1830s, and a former family vaunt was closed, Francis William Ogilvy-Grant, 6th Earl of Seafield had a new self-standing Mausoleum built 1837-39 immediately beside the church in the churchyard. The coffins of both John Charles and Ian Charles were interred here and the Countess Dowager then had a second, twin, Mausoleum built, located just outside the existing churchyard. Here James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield was interred in 1888. The Rev. James Bain, minister of the Church of Scotland parish of Duthil 1877-1911 sought to prevent the building of the second Mausoleum, claiming the first was insanitary as the coffins it held were stored above ground, unburied. After considerable controversy, his claims were shown to be wholly unfounded. His pamphlet, 'The Seafield Mausoleums and Duthil Churchyard case. A specimen of how officials tamper with the law in Scotland when they want to serve the great. Correspondence between J. Bain, Henry D. Littlejohn and Sir William Harcourt,' (Elgin, 1885) contained his objections.A copy is retained in the National Library of Scotland. Duthil Old Parish Church and Churchyard 07 The funeral of the Rt. Hon. Caroline, Countess Dowager of Seafield was held on 12 October 1911. This was the last use of the original Seafield Mausoleum. Having earlier had the second Mausoleum built, by her will Lady Seafield closed the first. A plaque bolted across its door reads: \\"In terms of the Testamentary Writings of Caroline Stuart, Countess Dowager of Seafield, this Mausoleum has been closed and is not to be used for further interments. February 1913.\\"This plaque was in place and visible, April 2017. The Tribute volume of 1911 contained an account of proceedings at the Mausoleum at the end of her funeral.: > The procession moved slowly into the churchyard, and when the dirge of the > pipes had died away, there was heard the voice of the noble clergyman > reciting the solemn committal service - ‚ÄúI am the Resurrection and the > Life.‚Äù The pallbearers followed the coffin into the darkened interior, from > which the voice of the officiating clergyman came to the throng outside. > When the obsequies were over, once more there was heard over the calm and > peaceful scene the tender, expressive music of the Highlanders. The piper of > The Mackintosh of Mackintosh, Mr Duncan Macdonald, at the bidding of his > chief, played as few could so well that fine setting - ‚ÄúThe Lament for the > Only Son‚Äù. It came as the climax and the end to a series of ceremonies that > will have an abiding place in the memory of all who witnessed them. There > are two mausoleums in the churchyard which have been the burying place of > the family. In the one that was opened on Thursday was placed the body of > the seventh Earl of Seafield, husband of the Countess, who died in 1881. > Here also were brought the remains of their only son, Ian Charles, who died > in 1884. The last vacant niche will be filled by the coffin of the late > Countess. In the mausoleum on Thursday the coffins of husband and son were > to be seen, lying side by side. That of the Countess, now rejoining in the > silence of the tomb those whose early deaths threw a shadow over the greater > portion of her life, was placed temporarily at right angles to the others. > The latter were still covered with wreaths, the Countess, up to a > comparatively recent date, having regularly visited the mausoleum.

Succeeding on the death of his father Giorgi I Gurieli, Mamia became involved in the conflict between the two eastern Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti in 1520; by force of arms, he compelled David X of Kartli to agree on peace with Levan of Kakheti, his son- in-law. Mamia Gurieli's 1533 campaign, jointly with his namesake Prince of Mingrelia, against the homebase of Circassian pirates ended in a fiasco, with Mamia being captured and ransomed later that year.  Accession and early rule  Mamia was a son of Giorgi I Gurieli, on whose death he succeeded as mtavari (\\"prince\\") of Guria, a polity in western Georgia, on the Black Sea coast, which emerged as a sovereign principality after the dissolution of the Kingdom of Georgia in 1491. Mamia acceded to the throne by blessing of King Bagrat III of Imereti, his royal suzerain. In modern historiography, he is sometimes assigned the regnal number \\"III\\" by virtue of his being the third Mamia with the style of Gurieli, the first being a son of Kakhaber I Gurieli and the second being Mamia (II) Gurieli. In 1520, Mamia was approached by Levan, king of Kakheti in eastern Georgia, with the request that he marry his daughter to Levan and aid the king against the encroachments of King David X of Kartli. Mamia, having secured for his troops a free passage from the atabeg of Samtskhe, traversed Ghado mountain, advanced into Kartli and defeated David X at Mokhisi. The latter fell back to his capital of Tbilisi and was setting a counter-attack in motion, when a dignitary, sent by Gurieli for parley, persuaded the king to join Mamia and Levan of Kakheti at a peace summit at Mukhrani. After the peace arrangement, Mamia sent his daughter Tinatin to marry Levan.  Expedition in Zygia  In 1533, Mamia Gurieli joined his forces with Mamia III Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, in an expedition against the piratical Circassian tribe of Zygii, whose vessels frequented the Black Sea coastline of Guria and Mingrelia. A combined navy landed the Mingrelian and Gurian forces on 30 January 1533. The first encounter with the fiercely defending Zygii was won by the allies, but, on the next day, many battle- fatigued Mingrelian nobles defected their lord at the instigation of Tsandia Inal-Ipa, an Abkhaz. The allies were routed. Mamia Gurieli was taken prisoner, while his son Giorgi and Mamia Dadiani of Mingrelia were killed. Later, Malachias I Abashidze, Catholicos of Imereti and Abkhazia, went to the Zygii and ransomed the survivors and bodies of those who died. Mamia died in 1534 and was succeeded by his son Rostom Gurieli.  Family  Mamia Gurieli was married to Princess Ketevan (Keteon), whose origin is not known. She is mentioned in two 15th-century church documents, agape records. Mamia had two sons and at least one daughter: * Prince Rostom (died 1566), Prince-regnant of Guria (1534‚Äì1556); * Prince Giorgi (died 1533), killed during the expedition against the Zygii; * Princess Tinatin (died 1591), first wife of King Levan of Kakheti. * Princess N.

The lower portion of outer walls was covered with board and batten wainscoting, and asbestos shingles covered the upper portion. The south elevation was dominated by a carriage porch, with an entrance door and three, double-hung sash windows on the south wall. The west elevation, facing the railroad, contained an agent's bay, entrance door, double hung sash windows, two freight doors, and loading dock. The loading dock extended across the north elevation and along the east elevation for access to two additional freight doors, then ended at a projecting bay, about mid-length on the east side.

Erected in Hill Park in 1916, the fountain was removed on August 18, 2017. History The fountain was commissioned in 1915 by the Winnie Davis Chapter of United Daughters of the Confederacy. The project was approved by the City of Helena Council, through its \\"Special Committee on the Great Northern Park\\" (prior name of Hill Park), as reported verbally May 3, 1915 by Alderman Riddell. It was designed by architect George H. Carsley, and built of Montana granite. Its dedication was on September 5, 1916: \\"The speaker lauded the present-day American spirit, a spirit of union with no feeling between the old north and south, which caused such bitterness and sorrow years ago. Both sides are now engaged in building up a better country to live in, making their homes more comfortable, their cities more beautiful.\\" \\"...I present this fountain to the city of Helena as a token of our esteem toward our new home.‚Äù The fountain's two inscriptions read: \\"A Loving Tribute to Our Confederate Soldiers,\\" and \\"By the Daughters of the Confederacy in Montana, A.D. 1916.\\" It was renovated in 1971, and again in 2008. The fountain was the only monument to the Confederacy located in the Northwestern United States. In the region, a few other place names and one dam included the name \\"Confederate,\\" plus one elementary school in Washington State was named after Robert E. Lee In July 2015, in the wake of the Charleston church shooting, some city officials considered renaming it as the \\"Civil War Memorial fountain\\". However, the Lewis & Clark County Heritage Tourism Council suggested they should keep the historic name and contextualize its establishment. Helena Mayor Jim Smith agreed that the historic name should be kept. By October 2015, they agreed to add a sign to contextualize the fountain. However, Mayor Jim Smith turned down the suggestion to add a disclaimer on the grounds that it was unnecessary. Nevertheless, by January 2016, city officials discussed adding a sign using language drafted by the Montana Historical Society containing a disclaimer about the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacy. Removal Detail of fountain and inscription In August 2017, in the wake of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, members of the Native American caucus in the Montana House of Representatives and the Montana Senate asked the City of Helena to remove the fountain in a letter. They included Democrats and one Republican: Shane Morigeau, Jonathan Windy Boy, Bridget Smith, George Kipp III, Susan Webber, Sharon Stewart-Peregoy, Rae Peppers, and Jason Small. A similar letter was sent by Helena-area legislators Mary Caferro, Jill Cohenour, Kim Abbott, Mary Ann Dunwell, Jenny Eck, Janet Ellis and Moffie Funk. As a result, the city commission asked the city manager, Ron Alles, to remove the fountain. Bruce Whittenberg, a former newspaper publisher and the director of the Montana Historical Society, argued that the fountain should not be removed, as it could be used \\"as a teachable moment.\\" Pam Attardo, Lewis and Clark County's historic preservation officer, objected to the removal and argued that the fountain was not \\"a symbol of hatred itself\\" as opposed to the Confederate flag. Chere Jiusto, the executive director of Montana Preservation Alliance, suggested it should be moved to \\"a setting where people can learn from our history.\\" The fountain was removed from the park on August 18, 2017. The removal was attended by 15‚Äì20 protesters, some of whom had spent the night in the park. Some protesters carried Confederate, Gadsden, Montana and US flags. Two protesters in their sixties were arrested for obstructing the work of the crew removing the fountain. Replacement The old fountain was replaced by the Equity Fountain on April 27, 2020. Fundraising to replace the old fountain was started by members of Helena DSA the same day that the city decided to remove it. Helena resident Ron Waterman successfully completed the community fundraising campaign, and managed the process of selecting the artist who was commissioned to create the Equity Fountain.

Community principles  The following principles, also noted as the Ahwahnee Principles for Resource-Efficient Communities were made by the Local Government Commission in 1991: # All Planning should be in the form of complete and integrated communities containing housing, shops, work places, schools, parks and civic facilities essential to the daily life of the resident. # Community size should be designed so that housing, jobs, daily needs and other activities are within easy walking distance of each other. # As many activities as possible should be located within easy walking distance of transit stops. # A community should contain a diversity of housing types to enable citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age groups to live within its boundaries. #Businesses within the community should provide a range of job types for the community‚Äôs residents. #The location and character of the community should be consistent with a larger transit network. #The community should have a center focus that combines commercial, civic, cultural and recreational uses. #The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open space in the form of squares, greens and parks whose frequent use is encouraged through placement and design. #Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence of people at all hours of the day and night. #Each community or cluster of communities should have a well defined edge, such as agricultural greenbelts or wildlife corridors, permanently protected from development. #Streets, pedestrian paths and bike paths should contribute to a system of fully connected and interesting routes to all destinations. Their design should encourage pedestrian and bicycle use by being small and spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting; and by discouraging high-speed traffic. #Wherever possible, the natural terrain, drainage, and vegetation of the community should be preserved with superior examples contained within parks or greenbelts. #The community design should help conserve resources and minimize waste. #Communities should provide for the efficient use of water through the use of natural drainage, drought tolerant landscaping and recycling. #The street orientation, the placement of buildings and the use of shading should contribute to the energy efficiency of the community.

Sand packs must be installed at the screen depths and seals in the borehole are constructed between the sand packs. Nested wells are different from well clusters in that the latter consists of a cluster of wells where tubes or pipes are constructed in separate, individual boreholes that are drilled and completed at different depths. When constructing nested wells, attention must be paid to ensure the proper placement of sand in the screened intervals and bentonite between monitored intervals, by measuring the depth of the sand or bentonite frequently as the materials are being placed. However, if the seals are placed to the exact depths specified in the well design, riser casings that are touching due to de-centralization in the borehole inhibits seal placement between the risers and can allow for vertical movement of groundwater within the borehole between different monitoring zones. The likelihood of vertical leakage through the bentonite seals of a nested well increases with the number of separate casings within the borehole, or when only a small thickness of annular seal exists between the various monitored zones. It is for these reasons that the installation of nested wells is discouragedCalifornia Department of Water Resources. 1990. California Well Standards.DTSC. 2014.

This work illustrates that nested wells can be useful to monitor discrete zones separated by thick borehole seals. However, nested wells are not recommended for contaminant hydrogeology monitoring mainly because it is generally not possible to obtain enough monitoring intervals in a nested well without compromising the seals between intervals.Cherry, John A., Beth Parker, Murray D.

Further, it is often difficult to conclusively determine if a seal has failed in a nested well.

Compared to other methods it is extremely lightweight and intentionally requires no support by a computer. The result is expressed in sticky notes on a wide wall. The business process is \\"stormed out\\" as a series of domain events which are denoted as orange stickies. It was invented by Alberto Brandolini in the context of domain-driven design (DDD). Event storming can be used as a means for business process modeling and requirements engineering. The basic idea is to bring together software developers and domain experts and learn from each other. To make this learning process easier, event storming is meant to be fun. The name was chosen to show that the focus should be on the domain events and the method works similar to brainstorming or agile modeling's model storming. Requirements It is important for an event storming workshop to have the right people present. This includes people who know the questions to ask (typically developers) and those who know the answers (domain experts, product owners). The modeling will be placed on a wide wall with a roll of paper rolled out on it. The sticky notes will be placed on this paper. You will require at least 5 distinct colors for the sticky notes. Steps Event storming legend of notes by their conceptual name with their associated colors and how they are laid out in relation to each other. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Step 1: Create domain events  Step 2: Add the commands that caused the domain event  Step 2b: Add the actor that executes the command  Step 3: Add corresponding aggregate } The first step is to find the domain events and write them on orange sticky notes. When all domain events are found the second step is to find the command that caused each of the domain events. Commands are written on blue notes and placed directly before the corresponding domain event. In the third step the aggregates within which commands are executed and where events happen are identified. The aggregates are written in yellow stickies. The concepts gathered during an event storming session fall into several categories, each with its own colour of sticky note: ; :An event that occurs in the business process. Written in past tense. ; : A person who executes a command through a view. ; : Processes a command according to business rules and logic. Creates one or more domain events. ; : A command executed by a user through a view on an aggregate that results in the creation of a domain event. ; : Cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. ; : A third-party service provider such as a payment gateway or shipping company. ; :A view that users interact with to carry out a task in the system. Result As a result, the business process can be seen on the modeling space. But more important is the knowledge that was built in the minds of the participants.

The low coastal plain has been formed from recent sedimentation, including sediments deposited by the rivers and sediments carried northward from the mouth of the Amazon River by strong currents and deposited by the tides. The extensive mangroves grow on the newly formed coastal mudflats and along the edges of estuaries. They merge into freshwater v√°rzea flooded forests further inland. The ecoregion is generally well- preserved, although excessive extraction of natural resources including timber and shrimps is a concern. Location The Amap√° mangroves cover an area of . They run along the Atlantic coast to the north of the mouth of the Amazon River up to the mouth of the Cassipor√© River. The ecoregion is naturally fragmented, with patches of mangroves developing where the conditions are suitable for their growth. The mangroves form the coastal margin of the Maraj√≥ v√°rzea ecoregion. They are part of the larger Guianan-Amazon Mangroves global ecoregion, which also includes the Maranh√£o mangroves, Par√° mangroves and Guianan mangroves. Physical The flat coastal plain of Amap√° is made up of Holocene epoch deposits, and is flooded by freshwater rivers and by the tides. Tidal range is about , and tidal influence extends far into the interior. Strong ocean currents run along the coast. The currents carry fresh water and sediments from the Amazon basin northward, depositing the sediments to form unstable islands and mudflats of fine-grained clay that are colonized as they form by the mangroves. A complex network of natural canals runs through the mangroves. The low terrain and high tides let the mangroves reach to inland. The ecoregion has a humid tropical climate. Mean temperatures are from . Annual rainfall is up to , with a dry season that lasts only two months. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the mangrove biome. =Origins= A study of sediment cores from the coastal plain near Cal√ßoene gives information on the way in which the mangrove and v√°rzea flooded forest have evolved during the late Holocene epoch. Sediment from 2100 years before the present shows no sign of mangroves. This was followed by a phase where mud filled depressions and tidal channels. Mangroves developed on the edge of the channels and herbaceous field on the higher land. In the next phase mangrove development halted and v√°rzea vegetation expanded, indicating more freshwater and less sea water in the area. In the last and present phase both the v√°rzea and the mangroves have been increasing in area, probably due to a rise in the sea level relative to the land. =Flora= Mangrove swamp (Avicennia schaueriana) in formation The ecoregion holds about 13% of Brazilian mangrove formations. The mangroves along the Amap√° coastal plain form zones parallel to the shoreline where different species of mangroves have responded differently to frequency of flooding, waterlogging, availability of nutrients, soil salinity and volume of freshwater from the rivers, the last depending on rainfall. The dense mangrove forests mainly consist of Avicennia, Rhizophora and Laguncularia species. They extend from the mean tidal level to the high spring tide. The mangroves extend inland along estuaries for up to . On the recently formed coastal land the mangroves are mainly in the Avicennia family, with canopies of in height. Avicennia germinans and Avicennia schaueriana are common, with the latter growing up to high. Away from the coast the Rhizophora mangle is more common, often lying behind a fringe of Laguncularia racemosa or sometimes the lily Montrichardia arborescens. Other mangroves found further inland are Rhizophora racemosa, Rhizophora harrisonii, Laguncularia racemosa and Conocarpus erectus. Non-tree species that grow among the mangroves are Spartina alterniflora on the margin facing the sea, and Hibiscus tiliaceus and Acrostichum aureum on inland margins and dry parches within the mangroves. The heavy rainfall and freshwater from the many rivers from the interior create low salinity so that palms such as a√ßa√≠ (Euterpe oleracea) and Attalea speciosa and freshwater macrophytes such as Montrichardia arborescens and Mora oleifera can grow among the mangroves. Other tropical forest species found among the mangroves include Dalbergia brownei and Rhabdadenia biflora. =Fauna= near-threatened wader semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) Mammals including howler monkeys (Alouatta genus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), tayra (Eira barbara), jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), South American coati (Nasua nasua), crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) also use the mangroves. Birds adapted to the mangrove environment include orange-winged amazon (Amazona amazonica), cocoi heron (Ardea cocoi), rufous crab hawk (Buteogallus aequinoctialis), striated heron (Butorides striata), semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), great egret (Ardea alba), green kingfisher (Chloroceryle americana), bicolored conebill (Conirostrum bicolor), greater ani (Crotophaga major), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and wattled jacana (Jacana jacana). Status The mangroves are the best-preserved in the Americas. The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". It is relatively inaccessible and has few people. The mangroves provide a source of crabs and seafood to the local artisanal fishermen, who use the mangrove wood for fuel and for building boats and dwellings, and use the bark to make tannin for dying the sails of their boats. The main threat is unsustainable exploitation, particularly commercial extraction of wood and other forest products, sea food and minerals, and conversion of the land into pasturage. Offshore oil extraction also poses a threat, since an oil spill could have a devastating effect on the mangroves and thus on fish stocks. The ecoregion is protected by several conservation units including the Cabo Orange National Park. The Marac√°-Jipioca Ecological Station protects the Ilhas de Marac√°, two islands about offshore in Amap√° municipality. The shoreline and stream banks are dominated by mangroves, with typical floodplain species of trees in the more elevated areas. The conservation units are part of the Amap√° Biodiversity Corridor, which contains the largest stretch of protected mangroves in the Americas.

Deliberative Planning focuses on actions, and the effect that they have on the course of a project. This planning method is a form of participatory planning, an urban planning theory that focuses on involving the community in the planning and management process. Participatory planning works to include all points of view in the decision making process, and gather them all into one vision. Being deliberative involves being motivated by an intended outcome and choosing a vision that is based on sound evidence and reason. Deliberation can take many forms in understanding planning, whether it be more formal and technical, or more organic and exploratory. According to Diane Hopkins, deliberative planning has three main parts: \\"the motives behind involving citizens in decision-making (Philosophy); the design and dynamics of the decision-making (Process); and the intended and actual outcomes of deliberative planning (Outcome).\\" These three steps are ultimately intended to involve the majority of the community, and the largest stakeholders for the proposed development. Deliberative planning does not have to be solely based in the planning field, but also has applications in computational programming and AI. In computational programming, the idea of being deliberative focuses on understanding planning, intent, and motivation to achieve the desired result.

A seminal figure in the formative years of modern African-American gospel music, he is responsible for an extensive recording discography, which included over 60 songs over the span of two decades. Beck's abilities as a pianist and trumpet player are praised as one of the best from the gospel genre. His work, both as an instrumentalist and live performer, however, was predominantly overshadowed by the career of Thomas A. Dorsey. Over time, nearly all of Beck's recordings have become more accessible through compilation albums.  Biography  Beck was most likely born in Mobile, Alabama, sometime during 1900, although other sources list two other possible birthplaces. Despite his prolific presence and extensive recording experience, little is known about Beck's early life and work. His first verified recording session took place on December 16 and 18, 1930, for Okeh Records at the King Edward Hotel in Jackson, Mississippi. For the occasion, Beck accompanied popular singing preacher Elder Curry and his congregation on piano, including \\"Memphis Flu\\", a song about the 1918 flu pandemic. According to some music historians, including David Hatch and Stephen Milward, Beck's boogie-woogie- based playing style on the record anticipated the works of many rock and roll pianists. \\"He may have been the best sanctified pianist\\", wrote Anthony Heilbut, \\"his playing was more legato and improvisatory than the herky-jerky ragtime of Arizona Dranes\\". During the 1930s, Beck became a proficient trumpet player. His recordings in the decade represent the formative years of modern African-American gospel music; indeed, Beck's work was preceded notably only by Thomas A. Dorsey, whose career overshadowed much of Beck's accomplishments. Following World War II, Beck capitalized on the proliferation of record labels, recording with several including Chart, Eagle, Gotham, and King. Many of his sermons dealt with dramatic and humorous accounts of the \\"wages of sin\\"; his most enduring songs include \\"There's a Dead Cat on the Line\\", \\"Jesus, I Love You\\", and \\"Winehead Willie Put That Bottle Down\\". Beck was minister of the Church of God in Christ in Buffalo, New York, in the 1950s, but his talents as a musician and preacher frequently took him across the United States throughout the decade. His services were broadcast weekly on a network of more than 30 radio stations. State University of New York professor William H. Tallmadge recorded Beck and his congregation at his church on December 30 and 31, 1956, releasing the assortment of spirituals and \\"holiness shouting\\" on the album Urban Holiness Service in 1957; The Heavenly Gospel Singers of Buffalo also make a guest appearance. The album is the last known recording of Beck's musical career. In 1960, Beck began missionary work in Ghana. He died there in 1972. Beck's work has been compiled on several compilation albums after his death, including Complete Recorded Works In Chronological Order 1930‚Äì1939.

Governance structure is often used interchangeably with governance framework as they both refer to the structure of the governance of the organization. Governance frameworks structure and delineate power and the governing or management roles in an organization. They also set rules, procedures, and other informational guidelines. In addition, governance frameworks define, guide, and provide for enforcement of these processes. These frameworks are shaped by the goals, strategic mandates, financial incentives, and established power structures and processes of the organization. Governance frameworks establish and perpetuate the efficiency or lack of efficiency in an organization or institution's ability to meet its goals, and even their public relations and perception. The organization of the governance framework is important for the success of the organization meeting its goals. Sociologist John Child states that these are connected and, in a circular manner, belief that changes in governance frameworks will succeed positively impacts the chance that the framework will result in the desired changes. Additionally, Williamson suggests that the organization of a governance framework results in economic consequences for that organization. Frequently, the term good governance framework references a preferred style of governance that the author believes to be better suited to that industry or organization, especially in relation to public relations, and organizational and financial transparency.  Applications  There are examples of the use of governance frameworks in a wide variety of industries, as well as in the government of nation states and the public sector. In their application to specific industries, companies, and problems, governance frameworks appear differently and reflect the unique needs of the group or organization. In the governance structure of internet technology (IT) organizations, multiple frameworks have been suggested by authors connecting IT issues to the underlying theoretical business, organizational sociology, and economic models. In marine ecology, governance framework suggestions proposed by Fanning et al. provide a guiding structure for the management and conservation of marine in the Wider Caribbean Region. Corporate governance frameworks are also well established and the theories behind how they are structured are discussed in academic papers, with different theoretical perspectives shaping how governance structures are used and influenced by the business. For example, Braganza and Lambert suggest that business leaders use an adaptable governance framework that they believe better addresses strategy as well as operation. In the public sector's governance frameworks, issues of public opinion and financial transparency tied to the concept of good governance frameworks are important, according to consulting firm Clayton Utz. The Charity Commission for England and Wales, a public commission responsible for ensuring trustworthiness of registered charities in the United Kingdom emphasizes its motives and mission, and accountability and transparency goals in its governance framework. It also uses the governance framework to make publicly available its internal organization and leadership structure. Loorbach suggests governance frameworks for nation state governments' development which challenge current paradigms and that he suggests will lead to more sustainable development.

Farmer‚ÄìLabor challenger Henrik Shipstead defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Frank B. Kellogg and Democratic challenger Anna Dickie Olesen. The 1922 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota was significant for a number of reasons. Olesen was the first woman nominated by a major political party in an election to the United States Senate. She was furthermore the first woman nominated by the Minnesota Democratic Party in any statewide election, and, together with the 1922 Farmer‚ÄìLabor nominees for Secretary of State and State Auditor, Susie Stageberg and Eliza Evans Deming, tied for the record for second woman nominated by a major political party in a statewide election in Minnesota (the first being the 1920 Farmer‚ÄìLabor nominee for Secretary of State, Lily J. Anderson). In addition to being the first United States Senate election to feature a woman as the nominee of a major party, the 1922 United States Senate election in Minnesota was the first United States Senate election held in Minnesota after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The victorious Henrik Shipstead also earned some footnotes in history. Shipstead was the first Farmer‚ÄìLabor nominee to ever win a statewide election in Minnesota. He was also just the fourth non- Republican to represent Minnesota in the United States Senate, the third non- Republican to be elected to the United States Senate from Minnesota, the first non-Republican to be elected to the United States Senate from Minnesota since the American Civil War, and the first non-Republican to be elected to the United States Senate from Minnesota by popular vote. Additionally, in the 1922 United States Senate election in Minnesota, Kellogg became the first Republican incumbent representing Minnesota in the United States Senate to ever be defeated, in a bid for re-election, by a non-Republican.

Q. n. Secundus was consul suffectus in AD 9, and one of the authors of the lex Papia Poppaea. Background Secundus was descended from a respectable, if undistinguished plebeian family. His father and grandfather were also named Quintus, and from their shared filiation we know that Secundus was the brother of Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus, consul ordinarius in the same year that Secundus was suffectus. It is unclear which was the elder; typically an elder son would be named after his father, but the cognomen Secundus suggests that he was the younger brother.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 691 (\\"Poppaeus Sabinus\\").PIR, vol. III, p. 86 (\\"P\\", Nos. 627, 628). Consulship Secundus was appointed consul suffectus ex Kalendis Juliis together with Marcus Papius Mutilus, succeeding Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus and Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus.Fasti Capitolini, .Fasti Antiates, . They held the consulship for six months, departing at the end of the year. During their term of office, Papius and Poppaeus authored the law that bore their names.Cassius Dio, lvi. 10. The lex Papia Poppaea was intended to discourage adultery, prevent the intermarriage of members of the senatorial class with freedmen or the children of freedmen, and encouraged lawful marriage and procreation, by establishing a set of regulations and legal penalties for those who remained unmarried or failed to produce children without receiving some sort of legal dispensation.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, pp. 691, 692 (\\"Julia et Papia Poppaea\\"). Cassius Dio notes with irony that both Papius and Poppaeus were unmarried and childless. The law was part of a more extensive attempt by Augustus to promote public morality. Other such laws came to be known as leges Juliae after the emperor's nomen gentilicium. Both for this reason and because the original language of the lex Papia Poppaea has been lost, and its exact provisions confused with related enactments, the law is also referred to as the lex Julia et Papia Poppaea. Tacitus relates that the law failed to achieve its aims, and some eight years after its passage, the emperor Tiberius established a commission to ameliorate its penalties, due to the number of persons subjected to prosecution, the number of informers whom the law encouraged, and the vast amount of property confiscated under its provisions.Tacitus, Annales, iii. 25, 28.

It was built as part of the Engenho Poxim sugarcane plantation, which existed along the Poxim A√ßu River, a small branch of the Poxim River, in the southwest of the municipality of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o. The church is located in a remote, rural setting in the present-day Rosa Luxemburgo II settlement. It was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1943. It church has fallen into a state of neglect and lacks the interior elements present at the time of its survey and federal historical designation. History Altar of the Chapel The chapel is a remaining structure of Engenho Poxim, a sugar cane plantation. A plaque above the portal of the church is dated 1751. According to records taken at the time of its inspection by IPHAN in 1943, the chapel was under the management of Edgar Rosemberg by the mid-20th century. The chapel was in reasonable condition during a survey in 1947, but had steadily deteriorated according to inspections in 1968 and 1971. It remains in a state of disrepair with few interior elements and is now nominally managed by IPHAN. Structure =Exterior= The Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim is built in a simple Brazilian Baroque style typical of rural churches in the region in the 18th century. The chapel has a single door of wood in a worked stone doorway with phytomorphic motifs. It is topped by a straight stone lintel with simple entablature. Two false windows sit on either side of the doorway; a historical survey states they had true windows in the past. Parallel windows are above with wood shutters. The fa√ßade has a broad, curvilinear pediment surmounted by a crucifix. Two simple spires flank either side of the pediment. The church has a gable roof of timber and cement. The base of a crucifix sits in the churchyard; the crucifix is now missing. =Interior= The table of the altar is stone topped by a wood niche. The IPHAN survey of 1943 describes a wood pulpit with stone base and a baptismal font in decorated stone. Both the pulpit and baptismal font are now absent from the building. There are at least two burials in church floor with inscribed slabs; one may be of Thereza Maria de Jesus (1819-1855), consort of a wealth landowner in Sergipe. Protected status The Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1943. Both the structure and its contents were included in the IPHAN directive, which include Book of Historical Works, Inscription 298-T, inscription no. 225 and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fls. 62.

Experts state that he would be ineligible to serve in the highest office in that city, despite being sworn in as mayor in October 2018.

It was released online by BBC Three on 3 December 2016. The episode was written by series creator Patrick Ness and directed by Julian Holmes. In September 2017, BBC Three confirmed that the series was cancelled, resulting in \\"The Lost\\" becoming the default series finale, although it was not conceived as such. Class follows four students of Coal Hill Academy and their alien teacher, as they deal with various alien threats. In the episode, after the events of \\"Detained\\", the group fell apart, unable to recover from the truths they learned about each others, when the king of the Shadow Kin Corakinus (Paul Marc Davis), resolute to take April's heart and the Cabinet of Souls, attacks and threatens to kill all their loved ones until he has what he desires. \\"The Lost\\" received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its fast pacing and saw it as a lead-up to a future season rather than a satisfying conclusion, although the performances and characters were praised. Plot The gang has splintered - they are alienated and alone, unable to recover from the truths they faced in detention. Miss Quill is in hibernation, but she is a ticking time bomb - ready for revenge when she wakes. Lost without one another, the gang must reunite when the Shadow Kin return to Earth, raging a ruthless, unrelenting war. Corakinus returns to Earth through minute tears in space-time and murders Ram's father and Tanya's mother. Following this, Tanya seeks the help of Quill and discovers her pregnancy. Charlie and Matteusz confront and threaten Ames into helping them. Corakinus returns and attempts to kill Tanya's brothers; Quill steps in to save them, but not before Corakinus is able to tie his life to Charlie's. Quill teaches Tanya how to fight in preparation for an inevitable war whilst both Ram and Tanya command Charlie to use the Cabinet of Souls in order to prevent any more people from dying. Corakinus threatens to kill Matteusz and tells April that he will leave Earth if she sacrifices herself; however, this is proven to be a lie. When the Shadow Kin invade Earth and take over the streets, Charlie is left with no choice but to use the Cabinet of Souls, which is expected will also kill April and himself. The Cabinet wipes out every last Shadow Kin, unleashing it across the city of London. Quill saves Charlie from the cabinet from killing him. Meanwhile April awakens in the body of Corakinus. Elsewhere, Ames returns to the Governors where she is judged unfit to continue serving them or witness \\"the arrival\\" for having allowed the Cabinet to be used, and is murdered by a Weeping Angel.  Production  The episode was directed by Julian Holmes. It premiered on 3 December 2016 at 10am. The episode was broadcast in the United States in early 2017 on BBC America. The episode was broadcast on 20 May 2017 in the United States on BBC America after the sixth episode of tenth series of Doctor Who \\"Extremis\\".  Reception  The episode received mixed reviews from critics. The development of the characters, and performances, especially from Greg Austin, Katherine Kelly, and Jordan Renzo were praised, but many reviewers felt that the episode was too fast-paced, and did not feel like a satisfying conclusion for the season's storylines. Entertainment Weekly's Nivea Serreao and Kelly Connolly both gave a positive review, praising the episode's stakes, twists and characters, especially Tanya. However, Connolly stated that it was \\"so overloaded with death-or-death problems that little moments never have a chance to land.\\" Doctor Who TV called Class \\"a finale that not only addresses the necessary narrative requirements, but does so in unexpected ways, shaded by the writer‚Äôs personal agenda, that inform Class ultimate message.\\" They praised the writing of the characters, and that \\"The complete destruction of the entire Shadow Kin populace is portrayed not as 'justifiable' but as necessary.\\" However, they thought that the episode \\"leaves too many logistical questions unanswered, and several characters see little resolution to their character arc.\\" They concluded by stating \\"Overall, Class is a remarkably efficient, seldom-rushed, eight-episode series; however, in trying to generate compelling interest in a second series, Ness‚Äô script for 'The Lost' feels irresolute. Such a dense narrative needed a proper epilogue, a ninth episode.\\" Flickering Myth called \\"The Lost\\" \\"a disappointing finale to Class ‚Äì one that, ultimately, is unable to deliver upon the promise of the series as a whole, and leaves the show‚Äôs future looking rather uncertain.\\" They heavily criticized the fast pace of the episode, calling it \\"a real tonal mishmash that can only be described as a disaster\\". Regarding the ending, they stated that it \\"confirms the growing suspicion that the Governors were a far more interesting antagonistic force than the Shadowkin could ever have been ‚Äì something we hadn‚Äôt seen before, something new, and by extension something exciting. And this is very much the wrong note to end the episode on ‚Äì and indeed the wrong note to end the series on. In some ways it feels like a dismissal of what‚Äôs gone on before, an entirely unearned moment of saying \\"actually, all the good stuff will be next year\\". However, he praised the performance of Katherine Kelly, and the characters of Charlie and Matteusz. Cult Box gave a very positive review, stating that Class \\"has beaten its own path rather than relying on elements from the main show. However, with the creative vision that Patrick Ness has demonstrated throughout, we have faith that he will put a new spin on the killer statues and we look forward to seeing where he takes them and Coal Hill Academy in the future.\\" In a moderately positive review, Vodzilla called the episode \\"violent and emotionally wrenching\\" and praised the treatment of the characters of Charlie, Matteusz and Quill, but also called it \\"dramatically limp\\". Mym Buzz gave a positive review, considering that \\"'The Lost' offered up an incident-packed, revelation-rammed, fast-paced, visually spectacular season finale ‚Äì and there were lots of really fun moments, exquisite character exchanges and big dramatic gestures to savour\\". However, they also called it \\"a frustratingly vague viewing experience\\" that \\" didn‚Äôt feel like a climax so much as prologue. It‚Äôs great to leave the audience wanting more, but not only because it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôve given them enough.\\" Den of Geek felt that the finale \\"didn‚Äôt let up in intensity\\", but suffered from \\"an excess of urgency and earnestness. When every note is emphasised and there‚Äôs no dynamic range, the result is‚Ä¶ tonal blandness.\\" He praised the show's tendency to kill off characters and not backing down, stating \\"You have to admire that kind of gutsiness.

Transportation in the United States creates mobility and access to different resources within cities. Some forms of transportation in the United States includes trolleys, metros, ferries, bus routes, highways, bicycling, trams and walking. All these forms are not used in every city. Each city based on the development and planning process of transportation decides what form of transportation fits best. One important factor in the planning process of transportation is the government interference such as funding, policies and regulations. The department of transportation (DOT) plays an important role in the process of developing transportation in different cities. Although the government funds specific transportation project and decides the safety as well as regulations in the planning, community members have the right to voice their opinion on the construction of specific transportation methods in a city (different geographical locations). Community members can come together in council meetings to speak on their inputs of constructing a transportation in a city that can possibly affect those living around the transportation routes. This becomes another important factor in transportation that demonstrates how community members are and should be included in the planning process of transportation. Another important factor to consider is how many transportation plans impact not only cities environmental stability but other linkages.  Historical development  The growing transportation systems in the United States did not develop just through historical transportation uses such as horses and wagons. The exploration experiences of the Spanish, British, and French settlers as they sailed through the ocean reaching land became an opportunity to develop possible transportation systems. In addition to this, the takeover of land lead to possible transportation routes as a resources for economic projects . Some possible transportation systems were train routes, the creation of the Model T automobile and interurban trolley service (1800s & 1900s). As technology continued to develop this also affected the way specific transportation systems were created which can possibly continue to change.  United States Department of Transportation  The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) plays an important role in transportation planning as a support system for both citizens and transportation programs such as Federal Highway Administration programs, Historic Covered Bridge program, and Safe Routes to School program. [2] This transportation agency also administrators different policies by making sure programs are following the restrictions and safe regulations within the transportation Acts. One of these is the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) passed in 1991 that looks closer to the safety and improvement of transportation forms for community members, transits, and bicycle facilities. The most important role the U.S. Department of Transportation has is offering community members transportation information specifically in roads and highways.  Walking and bicycling  Walking and bicycling are two transportation methods that play an important part of social capital within a community. Advocating and including land space for these two methods of transportation can lead community members to go on walks and jogs which can also lead to meeting other members within the city. It is important to consider how much land space within the planning process of transportation is going to be give for citizens to have the choice to walk or bike to specific areas. There are three forms of incorporating these methods of transportation in the development of a city. These forms are known as class one, class two, and class three routes. Class one focuses on the roadway paths that keep cars in separate lanes and that this lanes run separately from bike lanes. Class two focuses on pathways that include not only separate lanes for bikes but also concrete that gives citizens the opportunity to walk. Incorporating this concrete pathway does along more than one walk way but for bike lanes it is limited to one way. Lastly, class number three route is a pathway that shares the routes going to be planned. This includes bike lane on the same side of the street going in both direction within their individual bike lanes and concrete for walking.  Environmental factors in transportation  Different transportation systems affect the environment of a city but can also affect other elements. Transportation system planning impact three main elements that can go back and forth. These three elements are accessibility, land use, and activity. The planning process of transportation system can impact all, none, or one of these three elements. Therefore, during the process of planning it is important to consider what will be at stake if specific transportation systems are going to be built. In addition to these elements, transportation also impacts the environment around it. The increase of car use in specific cities within the United States has increased which can cause more pollution in the air due to leaded gas for fuel engines. Another important impact is that transportation systems can impact the national economy. This can be due to the large investments in specific transportation system development in cities such as bridges and construction of roads.

The serial is written by Asma Nabeel, directed by Shahid Shafaat and produced by Sana Shahnawaz. The title soundtrack has been composed and sung by Waqar Ali. It stars Ayesha Khan, Syed Jibran, Furqan Qureshi, Saba Hamid, Alyy Khan, Mehmood Aslam, Hira Tareen and others. Overview The drama revolves around Mahagul (played by Ayesha Khan), a mother who gives birth to an intersex child named Noor (played by Furqan Qureshi), and the resulting challenges she faces in her family and society ‚Äì where acceptance of the third gender remains a taboo. Noor's father, Zain (played by Syed Jibran) refuses to accept the baby and separates from his mother. Mahagul is a conscientious, strong woman who envisions equal opportunities and fair treatment for her child like any other normal being. She provides him a privileged upbringing and education while challenging societal norms. She is joined in her mission by Noor's tutor Mikaeel (played by Alyy Khan), who becomes his caretaker and treats him like his own son. Mikaeel also develops feelings for Mahagul. The serial sheds light on the stereotypes, gender discrimination and marginalisation that intersex people face within Pakistani society, and their identity crisis.

Women of Malolos  On December 12, 1888, Uitangcoy and a group of young and affluent Mestiza-Sangley women from the Kamistisuhan District of Malolos signed and presented a petition written by notable reformist Teodoro Sandico to Governor General Valeriano Weyler, asking for his permission to allow them to establish a night school for women where they can learn Spanish and other academic subjects. It was Uitangcoy who handed the petition to the Governor General while the other women fended off the Spanish Friars who were furious and wanted to know what was in the letter. Ultimately, the women won the lengthy battle for approval despite staunch opposition from the friar curate. After hearing of the women's victory, reformist leaders Marcelo H. del Pilar and Graciano Lopez Jaena wrote about the women in the Filipino liberal publication, La Solidaridad. Dr. Jose Rizal followed suit in his famous letter \\"Sulat sa mga Kadalagahang Taga-Malolos\\" to the group on February 22, 1889, wherein he lauded their brave efforts towards reform.  Philippine revolutions  During the Philippine revolution against Spain and as the hostilities between Filipinos and Americans broke out, Uitangcoy and a number of the women aided revolutionaries who fought against both the Spanish and American colonizers through their roles in establishing the Cruz Roja (Philippine Red Cross) and passing letters and communications hidden in their dresses. During the American colonization, Uitangcoy and nine others of the twenty women participated in establishing the Pariancillo chapter (one of the five barrio committees that comprised the local Malolos, Bulacan committee) of the Asociacion Feminista de Filipinas, which aimed to tackle several women's rights issues of the day.  Culinary legacy  Uitangcoy is also known for her great contributions to traditional Malolos cuisine. She crafted and taught several of the town's heralded recipes to the younger women of Malolos, specifically her niece Socorro and town bakers like Salome Ramos, who later popularized them throughout Malolos via her establishment, La Concepcion Bakery. Uitangcoy is credited for crafting the that does not use water but lard instead, made from carabao milk, (an with an outer-cover that is molded to resemble fish scales), , , and .

As a two-year-old he showed great promise when winning on his debut but missed the rest of the season through injury. In the following spring he won the Greenham Stakes and then rebounded from a poor run in the 2000 Guineas to win the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He failed to win again in 1983 but was placed in the Sussex Stakes, Prix du Moulin and Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes. He dead- heated for first place in the Lockinge Stakes on his first run of 1984 but was well beaten in his four other races as a four-year-old. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland and Japan and had limited success as a sire of winners. Background Wassl was a \\"neat, most attractive, bonny\\" bay horse standing 16 hands high with a large white star bred by the Lincolnshire-based Limestone Stud. As a yearling he was put up for auction and bought for 300,000 guineas by representatives of Sheikh Mohammed. During his racing career he was trained by John Dunlop at Arundel in West Sussex. Although he ran in Sheikh Mohammed's colours in his first race he was then officially transferred to the ownership of the Sheikh's younger brother Ahmed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. He was named in honour of Ahmed's football team Al-Wasl F.C.. He was from the seventh crop of foals sired by Mill Reef. an American-bred stallion who raced in Europe, winning The Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1971. His other progeny included Shirley Heights, Acamas, Diamond Shoal, Fairy Footsteps, Doyoun, Glint of Gold, Ibn Bey, Lashkari, Milligram and Reference Point. Wassl's dam was a top class two-year-old in 1973 when she won the Molecomb Stakes. As a broodmare she also produced Pennyweight, the female-line ancestor of Twilight Son. She was descendant of the mare New Moon, who was a half- sister to Hyperion Pharamond and Sickle. Racing career =1982: two-year- old season= On his racecourse debut, Wassl started second favourite for the Duchess of Kent Stakes over six furlongs at York Racecourse in June. He overcame a poor start to take the lead approaching the final furlong an won easily by three lengths from All Systems Go, despite being eased down by his jockey in the final strides. The form of the race was boosted in September when All Systems Go won the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster. Wassl however did not run again that season as he was injured in his stall (\\"cast in his box\\") two weeks after his win at York. =1983: three-year-old season= Wassl began his second campaign in the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April. Racing for the first time in almost ten months he was ridden by Willie Carson and started at odds of 11/2 after reports that he had been unimpressive in training gallops. After stumbling and swerving at the start he recovered totake the lead in the closing stages and won comfortably by three quarters of a length. In the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse at the end of the month the colt started the 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Diesis and Gorytus but ran poorly and finished ninth of the sixteen runners behind Lomond. Two weeks after his defeat at Newmarket, Wassl was one of ten colts to contest the Irish 2000 Guineas over one mile on heavy ground at the Curragh on 14 May. Lomond was made the odds-on favourite ahead of the French-trained Crystal Glitters (runner-up to L'Emigrant in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains) with Wassl next is the betting on 12/1 alongside the Dermot Weld-trained Parliament. Ridden for the first time by Tony Murray he was close to the pace in the early stages, moved up to dispute the lead at half way and stayed on very well in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Lomond. Called upon to explain the winner's improved performance John Dunlop said that the colt had \\"lost interest\\" at Newmarket where he had been drawn on the outside and had little company in the early stages. Murray confirmed that Wassl needed \\"something to race with\\". Wassl was then stepped up in distance for the 204th running of the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles, in June. With Murray again in the saddle he started the 10/1 fifth choice in a 21-runner field but tired from half way and finished fourteenth behind Teenoso. He was tried over the distance again in the Irish Derby on much firmer ground at the Curragh on 25 June and finished fifth behind Shareef Dancer, Caerleon, Teenoso and Quilted. Wassl was brought back in distance to around one mile for his next two races and ran creditably in defeat, running third to Noalcoholic and Tolomeo in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on 27 July and third again, behind Luth Enchantee and L'Emigarnt in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on 4 September. Less than two weeks after his run in France he was sent to Ireland and stepped back up in distance for the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse and ran second to the five-year-old mare Stanerra. On his final appearance of the season, in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 15 October he ran poorly and came home eighteenth of the nineteen runners behind Cormorant Wood. =1984: four-year- old season= For his first appearance at four Wassl was ridden by Carson when he contested the Lockinge Stakes over a mile at Newbury. He looked impressive before the race and started at odds of 9/2 against four opponents including Cormorant Wood and the three-year-old Trojan Fen who started favourite. His task was made considerable less challenging when Trojan Fen stumbled when exiting the starting stalls and unseated his jockey. After leading from the start Wassl was overtaken by Cormorant Wood in the final furlong but rallied strongly and the pair crossed the line together. After examining the photo finish the racecourse judge declared a dead heat, making Wassl and Cormorant Wood joint winners. Wassl was well beaten in his four subsequent races, starting with the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he finished fourth behind Trojan Fen. He was unplaced behind Solford in the Eclipse Stakes and then finished a remote fourth of five in the Sussex Stakes, although he was promoted to third on the disqualification of the runner-up Rousillon. He ended his track career by running unplaced behind Rousillon in the Waterford Crystal Mile at Goodwood in August. Assessment In the Free Handicap for 1982 (a ranking of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain) Wassl was assigned a weight of 119 pounds, 14 pounds behind the top-rated Diesis. The independent Timeform organisation gave the colt a rating of 93 p, with the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make more than usual improvement. In their annual Racehorses of 1982 they described him as \\"a very interesting prospect indeed\\". The following year saw Wassl awarded a 125 rating by Timeform, ten pounds inferior to their best three-year-old colt Shareef Dancer. The official International Classification concurred, rating him 10 pounds behind the top- rated Shareef Dancer making him the 14th best three-year-old colt in Europe. Stud record Wassl was retired from racing at the end of 1984 and began his career as a breeding stallion in 1985 at the Derrinstown Stud in County Kildare at a stud fee of 15,000 guineas. He was exported to Japan in 1989 and covered his last mares in 1998. The best of his European offspring included Wiorno Prix Dollar and Ocean Falls (Prix Quincey). In Japan he sired Meisho Amur, the winner of the Grade II Breeders' Gold Cup.

Specifically, if f:I\\\\to(M,d), where (M,d) is a metric space and I a totally ordered set, its p-variation is : \\\\ f \\\\_{p\\\\text{-var}} = \\\\left(\\\\sup_D\\\\sum_{t_k\\\\in D}d(f(t_k),f(t_{k-1}))^p\\\\right)^{1/p} where D ranges over all finite partitions of the interval I. The p variation of a function decreases with p. If f has finite p-variation and g is an Œ±-H√∂lder continuous function, then g\\\\circ f has finite \\\\frac{p}{\\\\alpha}-variation. The case when p is one is called total variation, and functions with a finite 1-variation are called bounded variation functions.  Link with H√∂lder norm  One can interpret the p-variation as a parameter-independent version of the H√∂lder norm, which also extends to discontinuous functions. If f is Œ±-H√∂lder continuous (i.e. its Œ±-H√∂lder norm is finite) then its \\\\frac1{\\\\alpha}-variation is finite. Specifically, on an interval [a,b], \\\\ f \\\\_{\\\\frac1\\\\alpha\\\\text{-var}}\\\\le \\\\ f \\\\_{\\\\alpha}(b-a)^\\\\alpha. Conversely, if f is continuous and has finite p-variation, there exists a reparameterisation, \\\\tau, such that f\\\\circ\\\\tau is 1/p-H√∂lder continuous. If p is less than q then the space of functions of finite p-variation on a compact set is continuously embedded with norm 1 into those of finite q-variation. I.e. \\\\f\\\\_{q\\\\text{-var}}\\\\le \\\\f\\\\_{p\\\\text{-var}}. However unlike the analogous situation with H√∂lder spaces the embedding is not compact. For example, consider the real functions on [0,1] given by f_n(x)=x^n. They are uniformly bounded in 1-variation and converge pointwise to a discontinuous function f but this not only is not a convergence in p-variation for any p but also is not uniform convergence.  Application to Riemann‚ÄìStieltjes integration  If f and g are functions from [a, b] to ‚Ñù with no common discontinuities and with f having finite p-variation and g having finite q-variation, with \\\\frac1p+\\\\frac1q>1 then the Riemann‚ÄìStieltjes Integral :\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dg(x):=\\\\lim_{D\\\\to 0}\\\\sum_{t_k\\\\in D}f(t_k)[g(t_{k+1})-g({t_k})] is well- defined. This integral is known as the Young integral because it comes from .https://fabricebaudoin.wordpress.com/2012/12/25/lecture-7-youngs-integral/ The value of this definite integral is bounded by the Young-Lo√®ve estimate as follows :\\\\left\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dg(x)-f(\\\\xi)[g(b)-g(a)]\\\\right\\\\le C\\\\,\\\\f\\\\_{p\\\\text{-var}}\\\\\\\\,g\\\\_{q\\\\text{-var}} where C is a constant which only depends on p and q and Œæ is any number between a and b. If f and g are continuous, the indefinite integral F(w)=\\\\int_a^w f(x) \\\\, dg(x) is a continuous function with finite q-variation: If a ‚â§ s ‚â§ t ‚â§ b then \\\\F\\\\_{q\\\\text{-var};[s,t]}, its q-variation on [s,t], is bounded by C\\\\g\\\\_{q\\\\text{-var};[s,t]}(\\\\f\\\\_{p\\\\text{-var};[s,t]}+\\\\f\\\\_{\\\\infty;[s,t]})\\\\le2C\\\\g\\\\_{q\\\\text{-var};[s,t]}(\\\\f\\\\_{p\\\\text{-var};[a,b]}+f(a)) where C is a constant which only depends on p and q.  Young differential equations  A function from ‚Ñùd to e √ó d real matrices is called an ‚Ñùe-valued one-form on ‚Ñùd. If f is a Lipschitz continuous ‚Ñùe-valued one-form on ‚Ñùd, and X is a continuous function from the interval [a, b] to ‚Ñùd with finite p-variation with p less than 2, then the integral of f on X, \\\\int_a^b f(X(t))\\\\,dX(t), can be calculated because each component of f(X(t)) will be a path of finite p-variation and the integral is a sum of finitely many Young integrals. It provides the solution to the equation dY=f(X)\\\\,dX driven by the path X. More significantly, if f is a Lipschitz continuous ‚Ñùe-valued one-form on ‚Ñùe, and X is a continuous function from the interval [a, b] to ‚Ñùd with finite p-variation with p less than 2, then Young integration is enough to establish the solution of the equation dY=f(Y)\\\\,dX driven by the path X.https://fabricebaudoin.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/lecture-8-youngs- differential-equations/  Rough differential equations  The theory of rough paths generalises the Young integral and Young differential equations and makes heavy use of the concept of p-variation.  For Brownian motion  p-variation should be contrasted with the quadratic variation which is used in stochastic analysis, where it takes one stochastic process to another. Quadratic variation is defined as a limit as the partition gets finer, whereas p-variation is a supremum over all partitions. Thus the quadratic variation of a process could be smaller than its 2-variation. If Wt is a standard Brownian motion on [0, T] then with probability one its p-variation is infinite for p\\\\le2 and finite otherwise. The quadratic variation of W is [W]_T=T.  Computation of p-variation for discrete time series  For a discrete time series of observations X0,...,XN it is straightforward to compute its p-variation with complexity of O(N2). Here is an example C++ code using dynamic programming: double p_var(const std::vector& X, double p) { if (X.size()  0) return 0.0; std::vector cum_p_var(X.size(), 0.0); // cumulative p-variation for (size_t n = 1; n < X.size(); n++) { for (size_t k = 0; k < n; k++) { cum_p_var[n] = std::max(cum_p_var[n], cum_p_var[k] + std::pow(std::abs(X[n] - X[k]), p)); } } return std::pow(cum_p_var.back(), 1./p); } There exist much more efficient, but also more complicated, algorithms for ‚Ñù-valued processes https://github.com/khumarahn/p-var and for processes in arbitrary metric spaces.

The school was open for both poor girls and boys, did not use the physical punishments normally used in schools, and used a pedagogical method inspired by the Moravian Church, and had a methodical and psychological foundation considered radically progressive and before its time. The school attracted attention for its radical views and became a role model for the Swedish primary school system introduced in 1842. Though the school was founded by the Swarts couple mutually, it was managed by Brita Ryy and the methods used were created by her. She also left two manuscripts of Christian education.

Wiesner (February 28, 1939 ‚Äì June 25, 2002), also known by his nickname \\"Big Dog\\", was an American politician and businessman. Wiesner initially played football for the Wisconsin Badgers from 1959 to 1961, before moving to Las Vegas in 1963. Seven years later, at the age of 31, he became the youngest person to be elected to the Clark County Commission. Wiesner served two terms before losing re-election in 1978. Wiesner was also an owner of the Marina Hotel, which later became the MGM Grand resort. In 1986, Wiesner was elected as Nevada's Republican National Committeeman, a position he held until his death. In 1996, Wiesner was also elected to the Nevada State Higher Education System Board of Regents. Wiesner also founded Big Dog's Hospitality Group, a local chain of restaurant-bar-casino properties. Wiesner was inducted into the Southern Nevada Hall of Sports Fame in 2000, and later died of leukemia in 2002. He was posthumously inducted into the UW Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008. Early life Wiesner was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, on February 28, 1939. He was the son of Frank Wiesner, and had six brothers. In 1944, the family relocated to Neenah, Wisconsin, near Lake Winnebago. Wiesner graduated from Neenah High School in 1957. Career In 1958, Wiesner became the heavyweight boxing champion at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (UW). Wiesner played as a fullback and a linebacker for the Wisconsin Badgers football team from 1959 to 1961. Wiesner was also captain of the team in 1959, and a co-captain and most valuable player in 1960. He also served as captain when the Badgers played in the 1960 Rose Bowl. In 1961, he was named the Wisconsin State Athlete of the Year. That year, he received a Bachelor of Science degree and was drafted by the Baltimore Colts. Wiesner was later traded to the Los Angeles Rams and played pre-season games before being cut from the team. Wiesner then tried out for a position with the San Diego Chargers and the Montreal Alouettes, although he never played in a pro game for either team. Wiesner and his future wife, Lynn Geary, moved to Las Vegas in 1963, and Wiesner started the Holmes Tire West tire company, named after the Holmes Tire Company that he worked for in Madison, Wisconsin. Wiesner was part-owner and the manager of the tire company, and referred to himself as \\"Tom Tires.\\" Wiesner also appeared in commercials for the tire store. In 1970, Wiesner was elected to the Clark County Commission, defeating two-term Democrat Darwin Lamb. At the age of 31, Wiesner was the youngest person to ever be elected to the commission. Wiesner sold his tire store in 1971. Wiesner co-founded Southwest Securities Development Company in 1972, and long served as a managing partner for the company. Wiesner was also the founder of Wiesner Investment Company, which subsequently built the Las Vegas Athletic Club. In 1973, Southwest Securities Development was planning the Airport Marina Hotel, to be built on the Las Vegas Strip. In 1975, the Nevada Gaming Control Board approved Wiesner as one of the landlords of the new Marina hotel, despite state laws prohibiting enforcers of gambling laws from owing a casino license. Wiesner was approved because he would not be involved in the project's casino operations. The Marina was built by Wiesner Investment Company. During Wiesner's time on the commission, two of his votes led to allegations that he had a conflict of interest. In 1978, Wiesner lost the primary battle to Republican opponent Carl Milzner, who subsequently lost the commission seat to his Democratic opponent, Jack Petitti. In 1986, Wiesner was elected as Nevada's Republican National Committeeman. Wiesner ran for mayor of Las Vegas in 1987, but lost during the primary. Wiesner became known by the nickname of \\"Big Dog\\". According to the Las Vegas Sun, Wiesner got the nickname \\"not so much for being a prominent Las Vegas businessman, sports enthusiast and Republican party leader, but more for his love, loyalty and dedication to his community and family.\\" In June 1988, Wiesner and his brother George opened the Draft House restaurant in North Las Vegas. Wiesner and his partners sold the Marina Hotel to Kirk Kerkorian in 1989. In 1990, Wiesner founded Big Dog's Hospitality Group, a local chain of Wisconsin-themed bar- restaurant-casino properties that included the Draft House, and would later include the Holy Cow Casino and Brewery, Las Vegas' first brewery. Wiesner had to persuade the state to change its laws to allow the operation of breweries in Las Vegas. In 1992, Wiesner created Las Vegas' Badger Desert Golf Classic. Wiesner also built the Sunrise Golf Course. In 1994, Wiesner was named as \\"Republican Man of the Year.\\" In 1996, Wiesner ran unopposed and was elected to the Nevada State Higher Education System Board of Regents. In 1997, the board also voted to make Wiesner the vice chairman. Wiesner was a supporter of University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), and founded the UNLV Football Foundation. In 1999, Wiesner was named \\"Educator of the Year\\" by the Nevada Restaurant Association. In 2000, Wiesner was inducted into the Southern Nevada Sports Hall of Fame. Later that year, Wiesner served as one of Nevada's electors in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. Wiesner Way, near Sam Boyd Stadium, was named after Wiesner. Personal life Wiesner married Lynn Geary, a schoolteacher, on August 14, 1965, at St. Anne Catholic Church in Neenah, Wisconsin. The couple had two children: Kari Lynn Wiesner (born 1969) and Kurt Thomas Wiesner (born 1971). Health decline and death In November 2001, Wiesner discovered that he had leukemia. At the end of January 2002, Wiesner underwent a bone marrow transplant at a hospital in Seattle, Washington, to fight the disease. Wiesner resigned from the Board of Regents to focus on beating his illness. On February 1, 2002, Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn announced Laura Lopez Hobbs human resources manager for Southwest Gas as Wiesner's replacement to finish the last year of his term. Wiesner died of leukemia at a Seattle hospital on June 25, 2002. Wiesner had served as Nevada's Republican National Committeeman longer than any prior committeemen in the state's history, and was also one of the longest serving committeemen in the United States. As a result, Wiesner had also become well known among Republican senators and governors in the United States, and was friends with President Ronald Reagan. =Remembrance= A private memorial service was held in Seattle on the day of Wiesner's death. Governor Guinn, who wrote a condolence letter to Wiesner's wife, said, \\"Tom helped in many ways, from raising money for scholarships to helping fund buildings on campus in those early years, to working to start a football program at UNLV, Tom has been a part of it all.\\" House Representative Jim Gibbons said that Wiesner's \\"generosity to Nevada and to his community will never be forgotten.\\" Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said, \\"Tom always did what was best for the city of Las Vegas and we were buddies off the bat when I came here in 1964. If I ever needed his help, he was there. You just can't replace someone like him.\\" UNLV Regent Mark Alden said, \\"When you look at him, he was really a big dog, but inside he was really a little dog in big dog's clothing. His biggest legacy is his big dog warm heart. Maybe that's where the nickname came from.\\" A public memorial was held for Wiesner at the Cox Pavilion in Las Vegas on July 16, 2002. Approximately 2,500 people attended the event. Former Republican senator Paul Laxalt, a friend of Wiesner, was among the speakers. The Tom Wiesner Award was created in 2002, and is given to UNLV football players who have Wiesner's \\"courage, enthusiasm, dedication and toughness.\\" In 2008, Wiesner was inducted into the UW Athletic Hall of Fame.
