Andreis has worked on a variety of films, theatre and ballet productions, both independent and commercial. She has won three Best Film Music Awards for her musical scores to the animation films Guliver and Bobo.  Early life  Andreis was born in Zagreb, Croatia, where she grew up and completed her early education. As a young child, she started learning to play the guitar and a piano. A film fan, Andreis set her sights on becoming a film composer and began composing at a young age. She started by studying classical music forms and works of composers of classical music by attending private classes. Her formal education continued at Berklee College of Music, where she first specialised in \\"Production of Music for Film and Games\\". After being awarded a celebrity Scholarship of Michel Camilo she completed her Master studies of \\"Orchestration for Film and TV.\\"  Career  =Film music = As of 2019, she has collaborated with Croatian, Russian and American film directors, including Silvije Petranovic, on the most-watched Croatian children's film of the 21st century:The Brave Adventures of a Little Shoemaker based on a 1913 novel The Brave Adventures of Lapitch by Ivana Brlic Mazuranic, Zdenko Basic (animation movie Guliver), Paul Sampson (Last David Carradine‚Äôs thriller movie Night of the Templar), Kirk Harris (drama \\"The Kid: Chamaco‚Äù, starring Martin Sheen), Russian director Taya Zubova (drama \\"My Dear Fish\\"), Andrej Rehak (animated fantasy film \\"Bobo\\"), Romana Rozic (\\"What a beautiful day\\") and others, for whose films she composed and orchestrated music. With director Andrej Rehak on 27th Days of Croatian Film Awards, June 2018 Andreis collaborated with composer Evan Evans (son of a jazz pianist Bill Evans ) as a member of Team score Composer's Collective, composed of cinematic composers dedicated to creating dramatic scores for film, television, interactive and commercial media. She is also known as a ghost composer thus much of her uncredited work remains unknown to the public. Andreis released two soundtracks \\"The Brave Adventures of a Little Shoemaker (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\\" in December 2015 and \\"Bobo (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\\" in March 2019. = Ballet and theatre = Andreis composed music for a Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb for a ceremonial opening of its 150th season in 2010. Andreis's music was interwoven with tunes by classical composers and poetry by the Croatian poet of the 20th century Dobrisa Cesaric, for a ballet performance named \\"The Silence of my Murmur\\" by director and choreographer Leo Mujic. Croatian theatre and movie actor Dragan Despot recited poems by Dobrisa Cesaric to Andreis's music. Andreis's a cappella composition \\"Song of the Dead Poet\\" (\\"Pjesma Mrtvog Pjesnika\\" in Croatian) was performed by Australian born singer Mary Crnkovic Pilas as a lead vocal, Sandra Tribuson and Anita Andreis herself. On a ballet show \\"Ghost\\", commissioned by the New Orleans Ballet Association and NOCA Institute, performed by Drew Jacoby, Rubinald Pronk and Prince Credell, the Anita Andreis continued her collaboration with choreographer Leo Mujic, composing music inspired by the story of an emotional metamorphosis of a Ghost. The world premi√®re of a Ghost was held in New Orleans, Louisiana and continued worldwide. The show was awarded in Belgrade, Serbia. In Zagreb's Comedy Theatre, Andreis composed music for the show \\"Look Who's Back\\", based on a Timur Vermes‚Äôs novel: Er is wieder da. The story was adapted by director Marko Juraga and Jelena Veljaca. The comedy is a satire about a contemporary man often misled by the media. It interrogates whether a modern intellectual can break through the silence of political correctness and defeat ignorance. Croatian actor Drazen Cucek won an award of Croatian Actor Award for the main role in a show Look Who's Back. During a ceremony, while receiving an award, the actor publicly expressed his admiration of Andreis's music and her composing approach. After Look Who's Back Andreis composed jazz noir, love, action and comic themes for the show The 39 Steps, again, in a Comedy Theatre production, directed by Marko Juraga. The 39 steps is a parody adapted from the John Buchan's 1915 novel and the 1935 film by Alfred Hitchcock. The play's concept of Patrick Barlow calls for the entirety of the 1935 adventure film The 39 Steps to be performed with a cast of only four where some of the actors perform more than 20 different roles. The script is full of references to other Alfred Hitchcock films, such as Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Psycho and Vertigo. =Songwriting= In addition to scores and soundtracks for film, television and theatre, Andreis's musical expression interlaced into a field of alternative pop music. Her appearance as a singer-songwriter started with her first single \\"Little Spring Snow Leftovers\\" premi√®red on Women of Substance podcast in 2015, and followed by singles \\"Clever Trick\\", \\"Your Pain is My Paint\\" and \\"Soldier\\", noticed both by music critics and public, claiming places at Top Lists and alternative music radio stations. Andreis's songwriting, atypical writing style, eccentric arrangements and complex song structures has been described by reviewers as an orchestral, ambient, indie, dark pop and art rock all at the same time as well as an alternative pop-rock genre cohering with film scoring background creating her distinctive sound\\". All the songs were executively written, arranged, orchestrated, recorded and produced by Anita Andreis herself. Andreis often employs and collaborates with many studio musicians, such as Tomislav Franjo Susak on bass (known as a bass player in a Croatian rock band Vatra), Nikita Nikola Jeremic on electric guitar, Ognjen Cvekic on acoustic guitar, Filip Zganec on drums and Krunoslav Maric, a member of Zagreb Soloists, on violin. =Nominations and awards= Anita Andreis won the Best Music Awards Jury Prize for her scores for animation movies Guliver in 2010. on Croatian Festival of Animation Film and two awards for score composed for the animation movie Bobo in 2018 on 27h Days of Croatian Film and Crystal Pine Award for the best original score on ISFMF (International Sound & Film Music Festival) in 2019. She has been nominated for a Best Music Award on 61st Pula Film Festival 2014 for her score \\"The Brave Adventures of a little Shoemaker\\", where the film has got a \\"Golden Gate of Pula Audience Award\\".

Plot  Pierre Belcroix and Marcel Blanc are violinists and lifelong friends living in Paris in the 1920s. While Marcel has become famous and Pierre has not, both are happy with their lives. Pierre is happily married to Romaine, a stylish young flapper. However, Marcel meets and falls in love with her, which Pierre little suspects. Romaine carries on her affair with Marcel, even as Pierre falls ill, which she may have deliberately exacerbated with her treatment in order to murder him. Soon Marcel goes on a concert tour, and Romaine abandons Pierre for a romantic tryst. When Marcel returns, Romaine reconsiders the affair, and realizes that she loves both Pierre and Marcel. She decides that she does not want to hurt either her husband or her lover, and as no other solution seems possible, she commits suicide. Three years later, Pierre visits Marcel to seek the truth, and Marcel tells him that no illicit affair occurred, thereby honoring her memory.

It's not obscure, but it's difficult to understand what it is about the project that so fascinates this most sophisticated and intellectual of French film makers.\\" Describing the film, he wrote, \\"Though the camera moves in for close-ups from time to time, the sets and lighting are intentionally artificial. A curtain falls between acts, and scenes are played in extended, fluid, unbroken takes that evoke the theatrical experience. Unfortunately, the film's opening scene sets such a high standard that nothing that follows can come up to it.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/05/movies/film-festival-alain- resnais-s-melo-from-a-1929-romance.html Scott Foundas of Variety wrote that Resnais' films involve \\"seeing just how far he can ostensibly push an audience away by exposing his artistic scaffolding ... all the while stealthily drawing us closer in. And beginning with 'Melo' in 1986, this ongoing experiment has increasingly drawn on explicitly theatrical aesthetic devices to at once push and pull at the audience‚Äôs attentions.\\" The film was presented at the Museum of Modern Art on June 21, 2014, with the write-up stating that \\"Resnais‚Äô symmetrical compositions and extended long takes emphasize the artificiality of the proceedings while liberating their emotional truth.\\" Accolades The film won the C√©sar Award for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, and was nominated for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design.

It is a collection of sixteen gated communities on the east side of Para√±aque abutting the city of Muntinlupa, and the informal settlements surrounding them. The barangay is a long strip along the north side of Dr. Santos Avenue stretching from South Luzon Expressway to just west of San Antonio Avenue by the Jaka Plaza commercial center. It is bordered by Marcelo Green to the north, the Muntinlupa village of Sucat across the expressway to the east, BF Homes Para√±aque across Dr. Santos Avenue to the south, and San Isidro and Moonwalk to the west. It extends to the northwest along San Antonio Avenue and also shares a border with Don Bosco further north and northwest. The village is part of the Para√±aque 2nd district. San Antonio is the city's administrative center, being the location of the Para√±aque City Hall. It is the most populous of the four barangays in Metro Manila bearing the name San Antonio. In 2016, the village also recorded the highest number of informal settlers in Para√±aque with 2,661 households illegally occupying properties in the village, and 607 households living in makeshift houses. As of the 2015 census, San Antonio had a population of 67,401. History Parish church of San Antonio de Padua built in 1970 The village was founded in 1978 as a result of real estate development and changing demographics happening across the Manila region in the decades following World War II. The multiplication of barangays was also aided by a national government program for economic acceleration through the creation of more administrative divisions during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos. The contiguous gated communities of San Antonio Valley (except Phase 2, 6, 12 and 15), Barangay Village, Fourth Estate, and Mon El Subdivision were separated from San Dionisio on May 1, 1978 through Presidential Decree No. 1329. It was named after its largest component village (San Antonio Valley Phase 1) where the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila established the San Antonio de Padua Parish Church in 1970, with Saint Anthony of Padua as its patron. In 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal and First Lady Eva Macapagal laid the cornerstone for the Para√±aque Municipal Hall in San Antonio (then part of San Dionisio) during a ceremony hosted by then Mayor Eleuterio de Leon. The building was completed years later during the term of Mayor Florencio Bernabe Sr. and eventually replaced the old Casa Tribunal in La Huerta. The San Antonio complex added a legislative and judiciary building in 2015. Education Several educational institutions are located in San Antonio. They include: * Agape Young Achievers' Christian Academy * Fourth Estate Elementary School * International Christian Academy * LH Montessori High * Parish Learning Center San Antonio de Padua * San Antonio Elementary School * San Antonio National High School * United Christian Academy * UP South School Transportation San Antonio Avenue in the vicinity of the Para√±aque City Hall Jaka Plaza on Dr. Santos Avenue in San Antonio San Antonio's road network consists of three national roads as of 2017. The South Luzon Expressway and elevated Skyway form the village's eastern boundary where the West Service Road, a national tertiary road, runs along a short stretch of its territory giving access to a few industrial and logistics facilities. Dr. Santos Avenue is a national primary road which starts at the village's southeast corner and travels the whole stretch of its boundary line with BF Homes. The San Antonio side of the avenue is lined with several retail stores including Jaka Plaza, Shopwise Sucat,the Santa Grove strip mall which also houses a Teleperformance Philippines branch, and Amaia Steps, a condominium with a retail podium. It is also the main access road to the different gated communities as well as a few slum areas in between those communities. The Elorde Sports Center, a popular boxing venue and the oldest in the chain of boxing gyms in the country owned by the family of Gabriel Elorde, has stood on the site across from the Manila Memorial Park and adjacent to Fourth Estate Subdivision on Dr. Santos Avenue since 1974. San Antonio Avenue is the main north-south thoroughfare of the barangay situated on the western side by the Jaka Plaza. This local road not only provides access to the Para√±aque City Hall, the San Antonio de Padua Parish Church and San Antonio Valley Wet Market, it also serves to connect the communities of San Antonio and Don Bosco and as an alternate route between Dr. Santos Avenue and Do√±a Soledad Avenue, through a maze of narrow residential streets in San Antonio Valley and Better Living Subdivision. Public transportation in San Antonio consists primarily of jeepneys and UV Express along Dr. Santos Avenue and West Service Road, and city buses along South Luzon Expressway. The village is also served by the Sucat railway station in the adjacent village of Sucat. Tricycles are the main mode of transportation in the gated villages and inner streets like San Antonio Avenue in San Antonio Valley, which is typical of villages in Metro Manila.

Samulski is the former director of the UNC Gene Therapy Center and a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Education Samulski earned his Ph.D. at the University of Florida in 1982 and his B.S. at Clemson University in 1976. He was President of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy in 2011. His contributions to scientific literature include 208 academic publications, and 408 research items, broadly cited by their scholarly discipline with 3,158 patent citations and 17,140 scholarly citations. Work He co-founded biotechnology companies active in gene therapy and AAV commercialization, including AskBio (Asklepios BioPharmceutical Inc.), a biotechnology company focused on AAV gene therapy, NanoCor Therapeutics, Inc. Chatham Therapeutics, Inc. and Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc, spinoffs from Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. He was the director of the UNC School of Medicine Gene Therapy Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina until 2016. AAV research Samulski‚Äôs research has focused on the study of the human non-pathogenic parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV) and its use in gene therapies. In the 1980s, as a graduate student, he pioneered the use of AAV as a vector for therapeutic genes. In 1984, he cloned the virus DNA into a bacterial plasmid. This led to the recognition of the potential of AAV and also formed the foundation for the two current FDA-approved AAV gene therapies. His work demonstrated AAV2 as a viral vector for gene therapy which led to the first U.S. Patent for inserting genes into AAV.BioWorld Today, April 3, 2014.

CNN, earning a Bachelor's degree in Oklahoma, and a Master's degree in history at Clemson University in 2008. Alan Grubb, her thesis supervisor, described her as one of his best students. Several years after her graduation he wrote letters of recommendation that helped her get a job as a contract linguist with the FBI in 2011. In 2014, the FBI was conducting a covert investigation into Denis Cuspert. As part of that investigation, Greene was assigned to communicate with him over Skype. Unknown to her FBI superiors, Greene used an additional Skype account to communicate with Cuspert. Greene told her FBI superiors she was going to use a vacation to visit relatives back in Germany, when in reality she had used her third, unauthorized Skype account to plan to meet Cuspert in Daesh-occupied Syria. She told her FBI supervisors that she was leaving for Germany on June 11, 2014, and would return to Detroit on July 4, but actually travelled to Daesh- territory via Turkey instead. Greene married Cuspert in Daesh-occupied Syria. CNN reports that Greene realized she had made a mistake within weeks of her arrival and found a way to return to the US, knowing she would face arrest and imprisonment. Commentators do not know how she was able to escape ISIL when many other people were not able to escape. Greene was arrested, cooperated, and pled guilty. CNN reported that her charge and sentence was considerably lighter than those of other Americans who had merely made unsuccessful attempts to travel to Daesh territory. CNN quoted speculation that prosecutors asked for a light sentence to reward her for her cooperation. Greene was released after serving a two-year sentence and relocated to Syracuse, New York, where she found employment as a hostess at a hotel. In 2019, when Daesh's last enclave was collapsing, Greene was compared to Hoda Muthana, an Alabama widow who had married a Jihadi fighter and then escaped to a refugee camp, and whose punishment was to be stripped of her US citizenship.

The brand closed in late 2016 and relaunched in November 2018 with a sustainable, direct-to- consumer business strategy.  History  Bionda Castana was founded by Natalia Barbieri and Jennifer Portman. The friends met in London while studying economics at the University of Westminster. In 2007 they quit their corporate jobs and launched their company, naming it Bionda Castana, ‚Äòblonde brunette‚Äô in Italian. Their first stockist was London boutique Browns who began carrying the collection in 2009. The duo‚Äôs designs also caught the eye of Vogue Italia Editor-in-Chief Franca Sozzani, and in 2010 the company was honored with the publication‚Äôs ‚ÄòWho Is On Next?‚Äô award. Dubai‚Äôs Level Shoes became a stockist in 2012, and luxury British department store Harvey Nichols followed in 2013. In 2015, Bionda Castana was named among Walpole‚Äôs Brands of Tomorrow, and secured London department stores Selfridges and Harrods as wholesale stockists. In June of that year, the brand opened a boutique on London‚Äôs Elizabeth Street, offering a made-to-order service in addition to the main collection. In January 2016, the brand launched a collaboration with high street brand LK Bennett, and by May 2016, the brand had already met its financial targets for the year and moved into a larger boutique on Elizabeth Street. Bionda Castana‚Äôs Spring/Summer 2016 collection launched with a campaign shot by photographer Dima Hohlev, featuring a ballet dancer as the model. The images saw Hohlov named Best Fashion Photographer in the LeBook Connections Awards 2016. The brand shuttered in late 2016 to allow the founders to separate from their investors. Barbieri later explained: \\"We weren‚Äôt aligned with our external investment team\\".  Relaunch  In November 2018, Bionda Castana relaunched after a two-year hiatus with a direct-to- consumer, sustainable business model. The zero-waste strategy sees just four archive styles available to buy for a limited period at the beginning of each month. The shoes are then made-to-order using surplus fabric from the brand‚Äôs old stock, and shipped direct from the factory to the buyer. On the decision to relaunch, Barbieri said: \\"There was a process where you have to break up and then start back up again‚Ä¶ Taking the break gave us the foresight to think about how would we be able to approach it in a smarter way and still be able to be creative and meet our customers‚Äô demands.\\" When the surplus archive fabrics run out, the company plans to use surplus fabrics from other fashion houses in order to maintain its zero-waste policy.  Collaborations  Bionda Castana has been collaborating with designer fashion brands on their London Fashion Week catwalk shows since 2012, including Osman, Matthew Williamson and Tala and Lina Samman. The Fall/Winter 2013 collection was launched with a short film directed by actor David Schwimmer and starring model David Gandy.

Freyfogle (born 1952) is a research professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and Swanlund Chair Emeritus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is a well- known writer and lecturer on nature and culture, on environmental and natural-resource challenges, and on private property considered as a dynamic, socially constructed institution. He has long been active in state and national conservation causes, including service on the Boards of Directors of the National Wildlife Federation and the Illinois-based Prairie Rivers Network. Biography Freyfogle was born in 1952 in Decatur, Illinois, and attended public schools there. Upon graduating from Stephen Decatur High School in 1970 he studied history at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on an Army ROTC scholarship, graduating in 1973. He then attended the University of Michigan Law School, where he served as Managing Editor of the Michigan Law Review. After law school graduation in 1976 he served as an Army JAGC Captain for four years in the Office of the Army General Counsel in the Pentagon, followed by three years as an associate at the Indianapolis law firm of Baker & Daniels (now Feagre Baker Daniels). He is a long-time lay leader at University Place Christian Church, Champaign, Illinois. Academic career Since joining the faculty of the University of Illinois College of Law in 1983 Freyfogle has largely focused his teaching and writing in the areas of property and natural resources law, including wildlife and water law, and on land use law and conservation thought. Following time as the Max L. Rowe Professor of Law and the Guy Raymond Jones Chair in Law he was appointed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2012 to the position of Swanlund Endowed Professor, the highest academic position at the campus. He has held visiting professorships at the College of William and Mary, the University of Utah, and the University of Michigan and served as a Visiting Fellow at the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study in South Africa and a Herbert Smith Freehills Visitor to the Law Faculty of the University of Cambridge. He has lectured in the United States and elsewhere, including Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, and South Africa. Scholarship Freyfogle is known for his wide-ranging, critical writings about private property, which he presents as an evolving, morally complex social institution that is as much cultural as it is legal. His 2003 book, The Land We Share: Private Property and the Common Good, critiques property laws and norms from an ecological perspective and proposes reforms to reduce environmental decline. His 2007 book, On Private Property: Finding Common Ground on the Ownership of Land, seeks to correct what he terms the widespread ‚Äúhalf truths‚Äù about private property, explores property‚Äôs functions and justifications, considers when landowners should be paid for development restrictions, and proposes a ‚Äúbill of rights‚Äù for ‚Äúthe responsible landowner.‚Äù These writings and others‚Äîincluding ‚ÄúProperty Rights in an Era of Transformation: The Record of the United States‚Äù and ‚ÄúCommunity and the Market in Modern American Property Law‚Äù‚Äîreflect his longstanding interest in the evolution of U.S. property law and the ways property norms embody evolving social understandings. They also reflect, as do other writings‚Äîincluding ‚ÄúProperty and Liberty‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrivate Ownership and Human Flourishing: An Exploratory Overview,‚Äù‚Äîhis interests in the complex, contradictory ways private property can influence human well-being. In various works he has called upon the national conservation movement to take greater interest in private property as an institution and to counter inherited assumptions with a vision of more ecologically responsible land ownership. He has also challenged the presumed divide between public land and private land, contending that all lands reflect varied mixes of public and private. The other central topic of Freyfogle‚Äôs writings has been the plight of humans in nature, understood culturally and normatively. His writings here have been distinctly interdisciplinary, making extensive use of environmental history and philosophy, ecological thought, and relevant social science scholarship. Many of his mature ideas came together in two books published by the University of Chicago Press in 2017. A Good That Transcends: Culture Change and Our Common Home explores the cultural roots of human misuses of nature, building upon such earlier works as Agrarianism and the Good Society (2007) and Why Conservation is Failing and How It Can Regain Ground (2006). The book illustrates, as do other works, his long interest in the writings of Aldo Leopold and Wendell Berry and features commentary on Laudato Si‚Äô by Pope Francis. Ultimately the book ‚Äúproposes, as a means to improve our dealings with nature, a far different intellectual and moral template than the one that has guided progressive reform throughout America‚Äôs history.‚Äù (p. 2) His other 2017 volume, Our Oldest Task: Making Sense of Our Place in Nature, takes up the challenges of distinguishing normatively between the legitimate use of nature and the abuse of it, taking account of the many relevant ecological, social, and moral factors. (Sustainability as a goal, he contends, ‚Äúis no more than a feeble step . . . an initial foray.‚Äù (p. 195)). The work ‚Äúendeavors to set the full intellectual stage‚Äù (p. 5) by exploring the sources of normativity and the rightful role of humans in attributing moral value while critiquing the moral thinness of modern liberal thought and the values embedded in market capitalism. It concludes with a strategy to put modern culture on a new trajectory. An earlier work on nature and culture, Bounded People, Boundless Lands: Envisioning a New Land Ethic (1998) received the Adult Nonfiction Award of the Chicago-based Society of Midland Authors. Along with the writings in these two areas have been others on more narrowly legal topics. His challenges to western water law show up in ‚ÄúWater Justice‚Äù; ‚ÄúWater Rights and the Common Wealth‚Äù; a trilogy of writings surveying the course of California water law; and his 2017 Wallace Stegner Lecture at the University of Utah, ‚ÄúWater, Community, and the Culture of Owning,‚Äù which includes a proposal for major legal reform. His writings on wildlife law include a co- authored work, Wildlife Law: A Primer (2d ed. 2019), the only survey of U.S. wildlife law.

The short film was shown at international film festivals and won a M√©li√®s d'Argent in 2009. In 2017, Kingz received a general theatrical release through its inclusion in the Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film, Galaxy of Horrors. Plot Olli () and Mathis (Mathis Landwehr), two small-time criminals are just about to make their first big deal as middle men. Mathis is nervous, while Olli is happily anticipating a big payment. All they have to do is get into an underground club, deliver a package to a local drug dealer, collect the money for the buyer and receive their fee. They enter the club to see the owner, but they are told that he does not receive any guests. Tensions rise as Olli starts arguing with the unwelcoming bartender (Frank Zube) who says he will make the deal. Mathis accepts this, and the man pays them and takes the package. Olli and Mathis head for the exit, but just then Olli recognises his younger sister Nadine (). Before Mathis knows it, Olli goes to get Nadine out of there, shouting loudly. Unbeknownst to either of them, all the while, the club owner, Luca (Bela B), has been occupied stalking Nadine among the crowd. Too late, Mathis realises what is going on, but before he can reach Olli and Nadine, Luca has sent his guards to take both of them. Mathis tries to follow them, but is stopped by the now openly armed bartender. A fight ensues and quickly escaltes into a brawl. Then the real trouble begins. Just as Olli and Nadine's bid to escape seems about to succeed, the strange club's secret is revealed: not everyone there is human. And not everyone will leave it alive... Cast Bela B (Dirk Felsenheimer), credited in Kingz with a mashup of his real and stage names, in 2007 Production =Background= in 2006 Benni Diez developed a love for horror and science-fiction filmmaking in the early 1990s, and worked for agencies and production companies in Bavaria before enrolling at Filmakademie Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 2002, where he specialised in visual effects and animation. There, he first collaborated with Marinko Spahiƒá, another student at Baden-W√ºrttemberg, on a short mixed live action animation film titled Druckbolzen (Pressure Bolt, 2003), made for ‚Ç¨250. =Development and writing= In the summer of 2004, Diez and Spahiƒá decided that their next project (and thesis) should be a live action thriller, a compelling alien invasion story with modern elements, especially hip hop and gangster rap, the title Kingz being a form of hip hop slang. The script underwent several rewrites, \\"and they had still no appropriate names for the two main characters\\"; in the end they used the names of the actors. Diez would serve as CEO for the production company founded for and named after the film, Kingz Entertainment, from 2008 to 2011, specialising in visual effects, working on commercials and feature films, notably Lars von Trier's Melancholia. =Casting and characters= in 2007 Mathis Landwehr was the first actor cast; Diez knew him from another production, and the actor's earlier work in the ' short films, his martial arts and stunt abilities making him an obvious choice (he choreographed the action scenes himself and had connections with excellent stunt performers, two of whom were cast for the film). The student filmmakers managed to land three German pop music stars. Kingz was German hip hop musician 's debut film. His character had been difficult to cast until it was decided to find someone who was active in hip hop, as opposed to an actor trying to mimic the look and style; Banjo's appearance and backstory were what they were looking for, and fortunately for them he was both available for principal photography and was agreeable to trying something new. A similar story applies with respect to the role of Nadine, Olli's little sister: she had to look young and innocent on the one hand, but also be an experienced actress, as her character undergoes severe psychological stress. After going through many casting agencies, Spahiƒá came across a photograph of . Her \\"unique appearance\\" and her feature film experience made her perfect for the role. The character of Luca was, from very early on, written with \\"rock icon\\" Bela B in mind, and, by this point, the filmmakers thought: \\"Why not simply ask him?\\" as with Banjo, he liked the script and he had the time. Release Kingz was submitted as a thesis film, and released in 2007. The short went on to be screened on the international film festival circuit for a few years. In 2009, in Trieste, it won one of the most prestigious awards for science fiction, the M√©li√®s d'Argent. =Broadcasts= Kingz was the first fictional short film ever to be shown on MTV Germany, at thirty minutes past midnight, Hallowe'en night, 2007. The short was televised a little over a year later as part of 13th Street's Shocking Shorts lineup, on 10 December 2008. =Anthology film= Kingz is included in the 2017 Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film Galaxy of Horrors, which comprises eight shorts within a larger narrative frame in which a man awakens from a cryogenic sleep pod and is forced to watch the shorts as entertainment while his damaged life-support runs out. The anthology film had its premiere in Toronto at Imagine Cinemas Carlton on March 1, 2017. the feature was conceived by Little Terrors short films festival founder Justin McConnell, who directed the narrative frame, and Indiecan Entertainment's Avi Federgreen. The production is the second collaboration between Rue Morgue Cinema and Little Terrors, following Minutes Past Midnight. =Home media and streaming= Kingz appears as one of the extras on the Saw films DVD collections. The Galaxy of Horrors anthology was released on DVD and special edition Blu-ray in 2017. The anthology was made available through various video on demand options on the IndieCan Entertainment website, on March 7, 2017, and on Amazon Prime. =Online platform= Kingz is currently available for viewing in its entirety on YouTube. Reception =Critical response= Todd Brown praised the cinematography and called Diez \\"an effects god\\"; the film \\"fuses a bit of gang culture with bits of horror, scifi, and martial arts action and does it all remarkably well... Landwehr gets time to show his moves and the whole thing just fits together beautifully and cries out to be made into a feature.\\" Five years later, when Diez had begun principal photography on his first feature, Stung, Brown recalled of Kingz: \\"that short was far and away one of the best I saw in that year, an amazing blend of scifi, action and horror elements that made me a fan for life.\\" Karina Adelgaard, reviewing the film in its 2017 anthology release, was \\"really surprised\\" that the film was ten years old: \\"It definitely feels very contemporary.\\" She also enjoyed what she said was a reference to Ellen Ripley from Alien. Reviewing Kingz when it was screened as part of the 2008 Fantastic Fest Online, Jude Felton compared it favourably to From Dusk Till Dawn and Botched, saying it did well, especially given the short length: > It's well shot, with some excellent camera, and is very slick looking > throughout... the cast do a decent job even if the characters are on the > clich√©d side. What really holds it all together though is the choreography > of the action scenes, which for a movie this size are nothing short of > excellent... In terms of the plot it isn't something that is particularly > mindblowing in its originality, it's in the execution though that makes it > work. Richard Sopko, reviewing the anthology release, took the opposite view, saying the film's production values are \\"subpar\\" when compared to the look of the other shorts, \\"but the story is interesting.\\" Carl Fisher considered it the \\"silliest\\" of the anthology, \\"with some cheesy acting, cringe-worthy dialogue & very odd fight scenes.\\" =Accolades= *Trieste Science+Fiction Festival, Best Short Film (2008) *Silver M√©li√®s (M√©li√®s d'Argent) (Short Film), Fanomenon (2009, presented at the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival) References External links *Official trailer on Vimeo *Kingz on IMDb 2007 films Student films German films German short films German drama films German action films German science fiction films German horror films Martial arts films German-language films ","title":"Kingz (film)"},{"id":"60593884","text":"Hugo James (died 1835) was a planter in Jamaica, the owner of Mount Moreland estate.Hon.

The former hospital is a Category B listed building. History The hospital, which was designed by Alexander Reid in the Tudor Revival style, opened as the Banff District Asylum in May 1865. A separate facility for female patients, briefly known as Woodpark Succursal Asylum, was built in June 1880 but was later fully amalgamated with the main asylum. An additional villa for male patients was completed in 1903. The asylum became Ladysbridge Mental Hospital in the 1920s and joined the National Health Service as Ladysbridge Hospital in 1948. A recreation hall was added in the 1960s. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in May 2003.

He originated from a Nahdlatul Ulama family, and was the younger brother of Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid. He served in the country's People's Consultative Assembly (1998‚Äì1999), and as the vice chair of the National Commission on Human Rights (2002‚Äì2004). During the 2004 Indonesian presidential election, he became the running mate to Wiranto, though the ticket lost the election. Early life and family Salahuddin Wahid was born in Jombang, in East Java, on 11 September 1942. His father was Wahid Hasyim, and his grandfather was Hasyim Asy'ari, the founder of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). He attended public schools in Jakarta, graduating from SMPN 1 Cikini and SMAN 1 Jakarta, before obtaining a degree in architecture from the Bandung Institute of Technology. He married Farida, daughter of former Minister of Religious Affairs Saifuddin Zuhri and sister of future minister to the same office Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, in 1968. The couple have three children. Career After graduating from his studies, Wahid worked in architecture and had leadership positions in construction companies, but departed these roles following the Asian financial crisis. Between 1998 and 1999, Wahid served in the People's Consultative Assembly. Following the fall of Suharto, multiple political parties were established which were related to NU, including the National Awakening Party (PKB) and the Ummat Awakening Party (PKU). Salahuddin's brother and later president Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur) joined PKB, while Salahuddin joined PKU. The two engaged in public debates published by the newspaper Media Indonesia during October 1998, on the topic of their father's vision for the country. Gus Dur argued that Hasyim supported Pancasila (the state ideology of Indonesia), while Salahuddin argued that he supported a state based on Islam. Wahid left PKU in September 1999. In 1999, Wahid ran for the chairmanship of NU. He placed third in the first round of voting, but withdrew from the second round. Later, in 2002 he became the vice chair of the National Commission on Human Rights (KOMNAS HAM). In the organisation, he led a team investigating Wiranto for human rights violations in East Timor following the 1999 independence referendum, which eventually released a conclusion absolving Wiranto's responsibility on significant violations. He also led the fact- seeking teams related to human rights violations during the May 1998 riots and in the Buru camps. Wiranto later selected Wahid as his running mate in the 2004 Indonesian presidential election. Wahid represented PKB, which was in coalition with Golkar, Wiranto's supporting party. Wahid resigned from NU's central committee and KOMNAS HAM in order to participate in the election. The ticket finished third with 22.15 percent of the votes, preventing them from advancing to the run-off which was later won by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Jusuf Kalla. From 2006 until his death, Wahid took care of the Tebuireng pesantren, which was founded by his grandfather. = Death = In January 2020, Wahid underwent an ablation in Harapan Kita Heart Hospital, Jakarta. He was later readmitted to the hospital because he reported problems following the procedure, which required a surgery on 31 January. His condition did not improve after the surgery and he died at 20.55 local time on 2 February. His body will be flown in the morning of 3 February to Jombang, where his funeral is scheduled in the afternoon. He will be buried in the Tebuireng burial grounds, in the same complex near his parents, grandparents, and his late brother Abdurrahman Wahid. Views Wahid called for NU to avoid politics. He also called for the protection of Ahmadiyya followers‚Äìwho face persecution in Indonesia‚Äìand called for the government to make use of the Constitution and the country's laws rather than Indonesian Ulema Council's fatwas as a point of reference. Wahid also stated that while he personally believed that the Ahmadiyya movement was theologically wrong, an organisation could only be disbanded if it violated the laws, and the disbandment must be done through legal means instead of pressure from religious groups.

Together with their families, they were housed in residential locations throughout the Netherlands. In total around 12,500 people. The KNIL was abolished in 1950 and the soldiers were demobilized shortly after arrival in the Netherlands. It was in the Dutch government's best interest to have the Moluccans return to the Moluccas as quickly as possible. When it turned out that no return was possible in the long term, it took decades for the Moluccans to gain a clear legal position in the Netherlands. Statelessness Upon arrival, all Moluccans were granted 'foreign status' because they rejected Dutch nationality and insisted on a return to the independent Republic of the South Moluccas. As a result of the Indonesian Nationality Act of 1958.https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b4ec8.html most Moluccans in the Netherlands lost Indonesian citizenship and became stateless. In the 1970s, the number of Moluccans in the Netherlands had grown to 30,000 persons. Most of them still believed in an independent Moluccan Republic, and did not wish to obtain Dutch citizenship. After the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis and other violent actions, the Dutch government decided to improve the situation of the Moluccans. It offered the Moluccans (almost) equal rights to Dutch citizens, without making them Dutch citizens. the Dutch government met the Moluccans in 1976 with a special law (the so-called Wet betreffende de positie van Molukkers) to equate the legal position of Moluccans residing in the Netherlands with Dutch citizens. Moluccans who fall under this law have no right to participate in elections, national and European. The third generation of Moluccans should get Dutch nationality by law.https://www.digibron.nl/search/detail/012ea41ea755d0ef2c6ea23f/nieuwe- status-voor-zuid-molukkers Facilities passport The Moluccans, who were staying in the Netherlands, only received a facility passport. The words: 'Dutch nationality' was crossed out and it was specifically indicated that those involved were treated as Dutch nationals. Due to many problems with traveling abroad, it was decided in 1991 to also offer the possibility of applying for a Dutch passport with the mention of Dutch nationality. Unlike the mention of Dutch nationality in the Dutch travel document, the persons involved do not actually have Dutch nationality but are legally stateless.https://www.rvig.nl/actueel/nieuws/2017/07/04/informatieverstrekking- bij-aanvragen-van-reisdocumenten-door- molukkershttps://www.gelderlander.nl/arnhem/molukkers-stateloos-ondanks- nederlands-paspoort~afe82eca/ Today only a small number of Moluccan inhabitants of the Netherlands still have this status, probably less than 1000 persons.

Early life Born into a long-established New England family, John Trowbridge could trace his roots in Massachusetts and Connecticut back to the early seventeenth century. His father, John Howe Trowbridge, was a graduate of Harvard Medical School, but did not pursue a professional career, having inherited a sufficient fortune to finance a life of ease. Evidently this state of affairs did not last, however, and the younger Trowbridge would later recount that he was obliged to support himself in youth by monetising his talents as a painter. Also an accomplished pianist and writer, a career in arts and letters seemingly beckoned, but pragmatic considerations led him ultimately to pursuit of the sciences. Academic career Trowbridge studied physics at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1865. Thereafter, he taught maths at Harvard (1866-69) and physics at MIT (1870), before his appointment as Assistant Professor in Physics at Harvard in 1870. He was awarded a Doctorate in 1873, under the supervision of Joseph Lovering. An innovator in scientific education, Trowbridge stressed the importance of a close link between teaching and experimental research. He is widely credited with bringing about a sea change in attitudes towards the teaching of physics at Harvard, and played a major role in establishing the Jefferson Physical Laboratory (1884) albeit Joseph Lovering was to be its first Director. In 1888, however, Trowbridge not only succeeded Lovering in this Directorship, but also was appointed Rumford Professor of Physics (in succession to Oliver Wolcott Gibbs). He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences from 1878, and was President of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1908-1916). Despite heavy teaching and administrative responsibilities, Trowbridge nevertheless published prolifically on his main research topics of electricity and magnetism, including works on the analysis of solar spectra and on the generation of R√∂ntgen radiation (X-Rays). Personal and later life Trowbridge married Mary Louise Grey (n√©e Thayer) in 1875, and although the couple had no children together he was much loved by his step-daughter Alice. After his wife's death in 1907, and his own retirement in 1910, he devoted himself to the care of his rose garden and to the study of the scientific works of Benjamin Franklin. He died on 18 February 1923, at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. References External links *Birkhoff, G. (1989) in A Century of Mathematics in America, Part II, ed.

He primarily advocated for those servicemembers still considered missing in action or prisoners of war (POW-MIA) as of the end of hostilities in 1975. A staunch political conservative, he also ran for local political office several times. He is credited with the research that identified Air Force Lt. Michael Blassie as the Vietnam fatality buried at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and for his role in organizing the annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle event in Washington. In Kinston, North Carolina, where he lived for much of his adult life, he was known for his local civic activism, most notably his effort to build a replica of the Confederate ironclad CSS Neuse, the only full-size replica of a Confederate ironclad, in the city's downtown. A native of Wilmington, North Carolina, he enlisted in the Army in 1963. Two years later, he was deployed to Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, where he did a year's tour of duty as a combat infantryman. Afterwards he became a Green Beret and served another tour leading and training a Civilian Irregular Defense Group along the Cambodian border, earning four Bronze Stars, an Army Commendation Medal and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. After returning to Fort Bragg to train other Special Forces soldiers for duty in Vietnam, he left the Army in 1973 with the rank of staff sergeant. Following his honorable discharge, Sampley worked in journalism and then settled in Kinston, North Carolina, where he opened a craft store selling ceramics, an art he had learned from local artisans in his off-duty time while stationed on Okinawa at the beginning of his military career. In the early 1980s he began his activism, after learning that not all the POWs and MIAs in Vietnam at the end of the war had been accounted for, joining groups demanding that the U.S. put pressure on the Vietnamese government. He started and published U.S. Veterans Dispatch, a newspaper primarily devoted to the issue. Sampley soon became known as an outspoken activist for his cause, using confrontational tactics similar to those used by antiwar protestors. He was particularly hostile to Senators John Kerry and John McCain, both of whom had served in Vietnam and were members of the 1993 Senate select committee which found that no POWs or MIAs remained alive in Southeast Asia. McCain himself, whom Sampley frequently accused of having been brainwashed by the Vietnamese during his years as a POW in the Hanoi Hilton, said Sampley was \\"one of the most despicable people I have ever had the misfortune to encounter\\"; Sampley was convicted of assault after a fight with McCain's chief of staff. He was criticized further for using the POW-MIA cause for his aggrandizement and personal enrichment; sculptor Frederick Hart successfully sued Sampley for unpaid royalties over his unauthorized use of Hart's The Three Soldiers on T-shirts he sold near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall. 1946‚Äì1973: Early life and military career Theodore Lane Sampley was born on July 17, 1946, in Wilmington, North Carolina. After growing up on a tobacco farm there, he enlisted in the Army in 1963, aged 17. Following basic training, Sampley went through advanced infantry training and then Airborne School. The next year he was assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade, then stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa. While there, when off-duty, he visited local potters and began to study ceramics. In 1965, the 173rd was deployed to Vietnam. Sampley served a year's tour of duty as a combat infantryman, recalling later that he had known very little about the growing conflict at that time. He was then promoted to sergeant and spent a second tour commanding a B-36 MIKE Force unit of indigenous minority population along the Cambodian border, part of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group program. In that capacity he earned four Bronze Stars, the Army Commendation Medal and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. Sampley wrote in his online biography that he was one of a few Americans sent to train at the British Army's Jungle Warfare School in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The two-month course was taught by instructors from the Australian and New Zealand armies as well as the British. He and the other Americans wore British uniforms so the British Army could better keep it secret that they were training Americans there. Returning to the U.S., Sampley became a Green Beret assigned to first the 3d, then the 6th Special Forces Group. He trained in, and trained others, in military subjects from guerilla warfare to High Altitude Low Opening parachute jumping. He also learned to speak Arabic and Japanese fluently. Part of the Special Forces curriculum was training in how to be a prisoner of war (POW), an issue Sampley said later he did not know much about until then. During the early 1970s, he began volunteering with Americans Who Care, a group formed in nearby Fayetteville to raise awareness about the issue. When the war ended, with US POWs released and returning home, Sampley believed, like many other Americans, that they had all been accounted for. Having attained the rank of staff sergeant, he was honorably discharged in 1973. 1973‚Äì1983: Post-military career After returning to civilian life, Sampley recalled, \\"I just kind of withdrew back into myself, like a lot of vets did.\\" He worked in journalism, both for a local weekly newspaper and a television station. His interest in pottery, first piqued during his time on Okinawa, returned, and after building his own kiln decided to try making and selling his own pottery. He started his business, The Potter's Wheel, and within two years had produced and sold 90,000 pieces, some of which were featured in a 1980 Country Living pictorial on rural potters in North Carolina. Sampley also became active in local politics. He served on the New Hanover County Republican committee. In 1976, 1978 and 1980 he ran unsuccessfully for county commissioner. Sampley's political efforts were not without controversy. During his 1976 campaign, the county's sheriff sued him for slander. Three years later, he tried to have the sheriff arrested. The county's Republican chairman would later refer to him as \\"a millstone around our necks\\". In 1982, during a relative's court case, Sampley got into an altercation in the courthouse. He was arrested, and ultimately convicted of assaulting a law enforcement officer. Years later, he expressed regret for the incident. \\"Some of those guys were my friends\\", he said. 1983‚Äì2009: POW/MIA activism The POW/MIA flag In 1982, Sampley was one of the many Vietnam veterans who went to Washington for the dedication ceremonies of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, a memorial whose design he had criticized. At the ceremonies he heard many other veterans express doubt that all the POWs and other servicemembers officially considered missing in action from Vietnam-era combat operations in Southeast Asia had been accounted for as the government had claimed since 1975, particularly those they had known personally. Sampley concluded from those discussions that the government knew more than it was publicly disclosing, and decided to get the answers. \\"When I came back from the war, I had trouble with authority figures\\", he recalled in 2001. \\"I heard people talking about how it was time to get over the war, I thought, How? When you've seen human beings all around you reduced to rotting flesh, you can't just flip a switch and turn things off.\\" After returning home, he resumed his activism on behalf of prisoners of war and those servicemembers still listed as missing in action (POW/MIA) in Vietnam. He, along with some families of the POW/MIAs unaccounted for at the end of the war, believed not only that the Vietnamese government knew more than it had publicly acknowledged about the fate of some of those men, but that some had survived the end of the war and were even still alive in captivity. The National League of POW/MIA Families (NLF), an organization founded during the war by Sybil Stockdale, wife of James Stockdale, the highest-ranking U.S. Navy POW during the war, took on a public role lobbying on this issue, and Sampley joined those efforts. Sampley took a highly visible public role in the movement, leading demonstrations and speaking to the media. He also started his own newspaper, U.S. Veterans News and Report (later U.S. Veterans Dispatch), to publicize the issue; it would later be described as \\"required reading for the MIA hardcore.\\" Many of his protests had elements of civil disobedience‚Äîhe often had the daughters of MIA servicemen chain themselves to the gates of the White House or other government buildings, and sometimes threw fake blood on security officers, especially the uniformed Secret Service officers at the White House. Other protests Sampley organized were more confrontational. He had protestors in bamboo cages, similar to those in which some POWs were exhibited publicly during their time in Vietnam, placed on the front lawn of Donald Regan, then chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. He also led another group to the house of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci during a heavy snowstorm, where they blocked his driveway with 1,800 care packages intended for POWs they believed were still alive and being held in Laos. The effort to draw attention to those prisoners believed to be held in Laos took Sampley and other American activists to that country in 1988. They traveled to its border with Thailand along the Mekong River and surreptitiously attempted to distribute dollar bills stamped with the reward offer, some floated in the river, offering a US$2.4 million reward for information about possible U.S. POWs allegedly still held in the country. While two members were captured and detained by Laotian authorities for six weeks, Sampley, who called Laos a \\"black hole\\" for missing Americans, was only briefly detained when he returned to Thailand illegally. Even allies in the POW/MIA effort found themselves targeted by Sampley's protests for what he considered to be a willingness to compromise. He organized a \\"bounty hunt\\" in which participants were encouraged to target NLF head Ann Mills Griffiths and other organization officials with water balloons, cream pies and rotten tomatoes if they saw them. At another time he led a group of protestors to occupy the NLF office in the American Legion's headquarters. While Sampley later described the effort as peaceful, Griffiths recalled that he threatened to kill her before being handcuffed and led out of the building. Sampley later acknowledged his tactics were inspired by those used in late 1960s political protests. \\"I took my training in guerrilla warfare and I turned it around on the U.S. government,\\" he told the Phoenix New Times in 1999. \\"I started thinking of as many types of tricks as I could pull to disrupt the system ... The idea was ... to disrupt the process, to cause the government to have to talk about the POW issue.\\" =The Last Firebase= In 1984 Homecoming II, a POW/MIA information project named after Operation Homecoming, the original return of POWs after the war, was founded in Kansas as a local effort. The founders began compiling information on POW/MIA cases, from biographies to reports of their possible survival in captivity, and began lobbying the U.S. and Vietnamese governments. Within a year, they realized they had compiled and made public more information about the cases than the Pentagon had given a congressional task force investigating the issue. The following year the group established a booth on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial where they initially kept a vigil to raise awareness of the POW/MIA issue and sold merchandise to support it. They also supported demonstrations in the area by veterans, including one who locked himself in a bamboo cage and began a hunger strike. It was named The Last Firebase, after the fire support bases established by U.S. artillery units in Vietnam to support infantry operations against the Vietcong. In 1989 the founder of Homecoming II stepped down due to family issues and asked Sampley to take over. He led the organization until its dissolution in 1993. The archives the group had compiled were transferred to the newly created The Last Firebase Veterans Archive Project. A year later Sampley would use information from those files to identify the Vietnam Unknown Soldier as missing Air Force Lt. Michael Blassie. =Rolling Thunder= Rolling Thunder riders passing onlookers at the Arlington Memorial Bridge into the District of Columbia at the 2009 ride. Arlington National Cemetery is in the background. In 1987 Ray Manzo, a Marine veteran of the war, visited the memorial in Washington. After stopping at a booth near the memorial run by one of Sampley's organizations, he learned about the POW/MIA issue. As a Marine trained to leave no man behind, the idea that living POWs might still be in Southeast Asia disturbed him, and he resolved to do something about it. He joined forces with Sampley and two other veterans to organize Rolling Thunder, a motorcycle ride from the Pentagon parking lot to the memorial named after a bombing campaign during the war, to show that veterans still cared about their missing comrades. The first run, held the following year, attracted 2,500 riders, a number that has grown with the years. It has since been held every year on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and has become one of the capital's best-attended annual events. The organization established to support the annual runs has also lobbied for passage of laws supportive of the POW/MIA issue. In 1993 Congress passed the Missing Service Personnel Act, which requires that the Defense Department have substantial evidence that a missing servicemember was killed in action before listing them as such. Two years later the Postal Service issued a stamp with the POW/MIA flag on it, following Rolling Thunder's lobbying. =Identification of Vietnam Unknown Soldier= alt=Four men, in military uniforms with different combinations of white and blue, stand on either side of a coffin at lower right, out of doors on a stone floor. Behind them are a group of flags. In the background and at left is an audience on risers In 1984 Sampley had gone to Washington again for another Vietnam War-related ceremony, the interment of apparently unidentified remains from that war in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A decade later he published an article in his newspaper asserting that the remains could, in fact, be identified. Items found with the remains in 1972, he alleged, indicated that the fallen serviceman was Air Force Lt. Michael Blassie, whose A-37 Dragonfly jet fighter had been shot down in the area five months before six bones found during the Battle of An L·ªôc. No other U.S. MIA within of where the remains were found, Sampley wrote, would have had the life raft, parachute, holster and identity card found with the body. Sampley contacted Blassie's family after publishing his article. Their inquiries found that the South Vietnamese Army patrol which found the bones had also found his ID card and a wallet with a picture of his family and relayed that information to U.S. forces in the area. However the Army lab charged with identifying remains found it unlikely that the remains were Blassie's based on identification techniques later found to be questionable; the ID and wallet had been lost or stolen during their transfer there. In 1980 they were classified as unknown; the remains were later buried as the Vietnam Unknown Soldier, despite not meeting selection criteria calling for 80% of the body, in the wake of political pressure from the president and Congress. In 1997 Vince Gonzales, a junior CBS News correspondent, read Sampley's article and began replicating the research with requests for documents under the Freedom of Information Act. He came to the same conclusion as Sampley, and the following year CBS reported that the remains were likely those of Blassie. The remains were later exhumed and DNA was found to be a match to Blassie's family; they were reburied near his home and the crypt in which he had lain for 14 years at Arlington was deliberately left empty to symbolize the fallen from Vietnam still not returned home. Sampley told CNN the whole process \\"was at the very best premature and at worst a politically expedient attempt to further close the books on the POW/MIA issue\\". Controversies Some of Sampley's activities on behalf of POW/MIA servicemembers led to controversy and, in one case, another assault conviction. =Allegations of fabrication and backlash= In 1988 Vietnam returned the remains of Navy Cmdr. Edwin B. Tucker, who had been listed as MIA and presumed dead after his plane was shot down over the country in 1973. Shortly after they were buried, Sampley held a news conference in Norfolk, Virginia, home to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet, where Tucker had been based during his service. Sampley claimed that instead of having been just discovered by the Vietnamese, Tucker's remains had in fact been kept on public display during the intervening years, after he had been beaten severely by the villagers where he parachuted into. In order to get them back, Sampley claimed, the Tucker family had been forbidden to say this. Tucker's son publicly denied this the next day and questioned why anyone would keep an unpreserved human corpse on display under glass for that long. According to Susan Katz Keating, a former reporter for the conservative Washington Times who went from believing completely in the possibility of living POWs to considering it a hoax, Sampley told a similar story of a downed American pilot killed by natives of the country he had parachuted into early in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. She recalled him calling her about Robert Wetzel, another Navy pilot shot down over Iraq, saying that he was carved up by natives who found his nametag and assumed him to be Jewish, then distributed portions of his body as souvenirs and was telling her despite the Pentagon's attempts to keep the story secret; he had nevertheless told Wetzel's family. Wetzel was later released unharmed; Keating recalled that Sampley later told her he had never completely believed the story but told it anyway to keep attention on the plight of POWs still believed to be in Southeast Asia. Later, Sampley responded that he had indeed found a story reporting that an American pilot had been beaten and killed by a Baghdad mob after being shot down and distributed it in good faith; he never told the Wetzels about it. In 1992 one of Sampley's protests resulted in the NLF publicly distancing itself from his actions. He had organized a group to disrupt a speech by President George H.W. Bush to the organization's annual assembly. NLF officials were able to prevent Sampley himself from attending the event, and Secret Service officers arrested him for trespassing before Bush appeared. But his group began heckling the president with chants of \\"No more lies!\\". After they refused Bush's requests to let him finish, he finally yelled \\"Would you please shut up and sit down!\\" at them; the incident made national news. The NLF's leadership was fearful that this would damage their relationship with the administration, and Griffiths not only personally apologized to Bush in a letter but took out newspaper ads with the same message. =The Three Soldiers copyright infringement lawsuit= In the late 1980s an organization Sampley founded, The Last Firebase (TLF), began operating a booth near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where it sold T-shirts and other memorabilia to support the POW/MIA cause. This brought them into conflict with other veterans' groups, such as the NLF and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Not only did they object to commercial activity so close to what they considered to be a solemn site of reflection and remembrance, they pointed out that TLF and two other organizations that were using the adjacent space for similar purposes were operating under National Park Service (NPS) permits that were intended for public gatherings on federal parkland, such as the 24-hour vigils for POW/MIA servicemembers that they had started out doing. Jan Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation (VVMF), who had spearheaded the effort to erect the memorial, was especially incensed. \\"[They're] a blight on what's supposed to be one of the most beautiful places in the country,\\" he told the Washington City Paper in 1991, pointing to a photo of the trash the booths left behind. Scruggs' opposition was particularly antagonistic to Sampley and other POW/MIA activists who volunteered at the booths since Scruggs was highly skeptical of claims that any American military personnel otherwise unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, having suggested that believing they were was akin to believing that UFOs were real. Scruggs had also angered the veterans at the booths by saying that they perpetuated stereotypes of Vietnam veterans as disgruntled and alienated from society. He noted that he himself, like many other veterans, had gone onto a professional career, in his case in law, after his return from Vietnam and efforts to build the memorial. \\"I suppose some of them are down there having a good time\\", he said in 2001. \\"It's better than working at Wal-Mart.\\" The NPS was reluctant to take action against TLF and the other organizations operating the booths, since they were in compliance with the terms of their permits, which allow merchandise sales. In 1991 Scruggs and sculptor Frederick Hart, whose The Three Soldiers was added to the memorial shortly after its completion to make those it memorializes less abstract, discovered TLF was selling T-shirts with the sculpture on it, without having licensed the image from the sculptor and the VVMF, who jointly owned the copyright, and filed suit against Sampley and TLF for infringement. Sampley refused multiple offers from Scruggs to settle the case out of court, offering to let him and TLF license the image. He also rebuffed similar efforts by Tom Burch, another outspoken POW/MIA activist, to work out a settlement. Instead, Sampley attacked Hart in his newspaper, noting that by the sculptor's own recollection he had been gassed during antiwar demonstrations in the late 1960s and asserting that Hart had made a large amount of money from others' licensing fees (in fact, he did not keep any of the money he received). Scruggs came in for some criticism as well. Sampley noted that under the legislation which authorized the memorial, the fund Scruggs started to pay for it should have spent its remaining money and dissolved itself in 1984 after the memorial was completed and opened to the public. Instead, Sampley wrote, Scruggs had turned it into the VVMF and made it permanent, on the argument that some of the memorial's granite panels had already cracked and needed repair. Sampley noted that money that had been raised from the public to pay for those repairs was instead being spent on high-priced Washington lawyers in the lawsuit. He argued in court that since the statue had been placed on public land and was maintained at public expense, it was a \\"national symbol\\" that could not be copyrighted. Nevertheless, he offered to settle the case by having Homecoming II pay for the panel repairs. In 1993 the federal court hearing the case held for Hart and Scruggs. They were awarded almost $360,000 in unpaid royalties; as part of the judgment they were entitled to seize Sampley's house and business. Records he had filed with the court showed that he had made more money than the judgment from T-shirt sales. Sampley had formed one company, Red Hawk, to make the T-shirts, which it then sold to Homecoming II, a non-profit POW/MIA organization started by others in the 1980s whose founders had asked Sampley to take control of after a few years. Sampley himself claimed to have almost no money, but Red Hawk grossed almost $2 million over three years (Sampley claimed later that Scruggs's lawyers had deliberately exaggerated that number by including revenues from his for-profit businesses). At the same time, Keating wrote in her book, the Homecoming II volunteers who manned the booths received nothing beyond free lodging at a house owned by the organization. Before Hart and Scruggs could collect, however, Sampley, who had vowed never to pay \\"homage\\" to Scruggs, shut down both Red Hawk and Homecoming II, transferring their assets to new companies and organizations. By the time collection efforts began, there was nothing to collect. He never paid, and Scruggs and Hart eventually stopped trying to collect. Sampley did comply with the aspect of the court's ruling enjoining him from further sales of T-shirts with the statue on them. In 1995, as a result of the court's ruling, the NPS banned all organizations with permits to operate booths on the Mall from selling T-shirts, save the company that operates the guest services kiosks; two years later the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban as not infringing on First Amendment rights. Sampley later attributed the whole affair to his own stubbornness. \\"It was the biggest mistake of my life\\", he told the City Paper in 2001. Scruggs later told Keating that two months before Sampley's death, he ran into him at an event at the memorial, and the two had a pleasant and civil conversation over their mutual heart problems; he recalled that Sampley looked weak. Sampley later donated $5,000 to the foundation for an educational center. Although Sampley never said so, Scruggs believes it was an attempt to reconcile. =Attacks on John Kerry and John McCain= alt=Two white men in suits standing next to each other inside a room with white walls lit by a camera flash. The one on the left has his right side to the viewer and is taller; the one on the right is older, with thin white hair, and faces the viewer In 1991, the Senate convened a select committee to examine the POW/MIA issue, chaired by John Kerry and thus known as the Kerry Committee. It began holding hearings during the next Congress. Sampley and other activists were dubious about whether the committee, whose membership included all the sitting senators who were Vietnam-era combat veterans, was really committed to fully investigating the issue. They believed that its true purpose was to resolve the issue by concluding that all POW/MIAs had been accounted for and none were still alive in order to clear a major obstacle to normalizing relations with Vietnam. The committee did indeed reach a conclusion that if there were any remaining living POWs, there were not many and all the other cases that could be accounted for had been, prompting criticism from one of its members, Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who had introduced the resolution that created the committee. Kerry and John McCain, ranking Republican on the committee and himself a former POW, both rejected claims that the committee had covered up evidence contradictory to that conclusion, or allowed federal officials to lie under oath to the committee. Early in the process, Sampley had called for Kerry to resign after what he alleged was witness tampering by committee staff who reported to him; in response, he claimed, the committee began investigating him and his business activities related to POW/MIA activism; when Keating published her book the next years, with an entire chapter devoted to him, Sampley accused her of doing so at the behest of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he believed had been trying to discredit him and other activists who believed there were still living POWs. McCain in particular had drawn the activists' ire early in the hearings. He had stated publicly that most of them were \\"not zealots in a good cause. They are criminals and some of the most craven, most cynical and most despicable human beings to ever run a scam.\\" McCain also publicly embraced former North Vietnamese Army colonel B√πi T√≠n while reducing one POW/MIA family member to tears with harsh questioning. Fight with McCain aide As the hearings wound down, in December 1992, Sampley wrote an article about McCain for his newspaper, calling him a \\"Manchurian candidate\\", beholden to the Vietnamese and depicting him on the cover with a queen of diamonds in the background, alluding to the film and novel from which the term came. While in Washington, he began leaving copies of his newspaper in every senator's office. Although he intended to skip McCain's, he said later that he had been in a hurry and did not look closely at the name on the door, and thus left one in the Arizona senator's. McCain's chief of staff, Mark Salter, confronted him when he entered and ordered him to leave, which Sampley said he was already doing when Salter followed him into the hall because, according to Salter, Sampley had told him he had something to tell him. In Sampley's account, that was an invitation to a fistfight outside. Salter, by his own later admission, touched Sampley first, pushing him from behind‚Äîafter, Sampley wrote, following him down the hall; Salter says he merely tapped Sampley's shoulder. In response, Sampley \\"decked\\" him. Capitol police intervened and arrested Sampley after, he claimed, Salter misrepresented the situation. After two days in jail, he was released. Salter asked him if he would agree to stay away from the senator and his staff, but Sampley refused, so he pressed the assault charge. The judge at trial took Salter's word, and sentenced Sampley to time served and 180 days' probation. He also issued a restraining order similarly barring Sampley from contact with McCain or his staff. McCain and Kerry presidential campaigns In 2000 McCain sought the Republican presidential nomination. Sampley and other veterans still angry with the senator over his 1993 performance formed Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain. On his newspaper's website, Sampley posted a page of links to articles by himself and others, going back to 1997, criticizing McCain's service as a POW. In 1993 during the hearings, Sampley claimed, McCain along with Rep. Pete Peterson, another former Vietnam POW who became the first postwar U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, had privately beseeched the Vietnamese government to never make its files on American POWs public. Sampley suggested that during his confinement, McCain had collaborated with the Vietnamese at one point in exchange for medical treatment, and wanted to prevent that from becoming public knowledge. Four years later, Kerry, a Navy veteran of the war who had called Sampley a \\"stupid ass\\" in response to his attacks on McCain, won the Democratic nomination for president. Sampley helped organize Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry and disseminated material disparaging the Massachusetts senator's antiwar activism as unpatriotic and a betrayal of his fellow veterans. McCain came to Kerry's defense, saying that Sampley was \\"the most despicable person I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.\\" Sampley called the remark \\"unbecoming\\" a senator and later addressed it more specifically: \\"What does that say about his relationship with the Vietnamese prison guards whom he claims brutally tortured him daily?\\" In 2008, McCain again ran for president and this time won his party's nomination, although he lost to Democrat Barack Obama in the general election. Once again, Sampley organized efforts to oppose him and distributed his accusations of collaboration, this time in the form of Vetting John McCain, a self-published book. He was joined by other veterans who had supported the effort before and former Republican congressmen Bill Hendon and John LeBoutillier, who had strongly supported the cause of POW/MIA activists during brief House terms in the early 1980s. \\"He took away the only leverage we had for getting those soldiers back\\", Sampley told the New York Daily News, referring to McCain's role in normalizing relations with Vietnam in the 1990s. \\"Why? He was paying back the Vietnamese for keeping quiet about him.\\" In his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For, McCain's opinion of Sampley was mutual: McCain wrote that he later decided to take Sampley's accusations in stride, referring to himself as the \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" in speeches \\"probably more often than Sampley has repeated the accusation.\\" It was repeated and disseminated among McCain's critics after Sampley's death, especially during the administration of Donald Trump, whom McCain had criticized frequently until his own death in 2018. CSS Neuse replica and local activism Model of CSS Neuse at Kinston museum Sampley was also involved in efforts to revitalize downtown Kinston, where he owned several other businesses besides his pottery shop. In 1991 the Lenoir County Chamber of Commerce recognized his efforts. The following year the Raleigh News & Observer honored Sampley as a \\"Tar Heel of the Week\\". In the late 1990s, he grew disgusted with the sight of one overgrown vacant lot on a major intersection. He proposed to a group of Kinstonians he assembled at a local cafe that they organize to build a life- size replica of the CSS Neuse, an early ironclad of the Confederate States Navy whose remains are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and put it on the lot as a tourist attraction. Listeners were doubtful, but two weeks later, at their next gathering, Sampley was accompanied by Alton Stapleford, a retired master boat builder. He explained how it could be done, and in 2002 the Neuse II Foundation was established and construction began. Local volunteers spent the next several months putting timbers into place; the replica is the only full-size replica of a Confederate ironclad. It opened to tourists in 2009. In the 1990s the state's Department of Natural and Cultural Resources had built the first structure to house the remaining hull of the original Neuse on another lot in downtown Kinston. Sampley and other local historians believed that site possibly also contained the true grave of North Carolina's first governor, Richard Caswell, who had also done the original land survey of Kinston. Sampley announced a contest to find that site, with the state to judge the winner; however officials at the department were angry that he did so without informing them. Sampley was unperturbed: \\"It's a question the state should have answered a long time ago\\", he wrote. In 2004 Sampley and a fellow activist pressured both the Lenoir County commissioners and the Kinston city council to pass a resolution stating that God was the foundation of American government and that the Founding Fathers had never intended for the modern degree of separation of church and state. It was modeled on a resolution that had recently been passed in Greene County, Tennessee. While it passed the city council unanimously, many members said they felt they had been \\"coerced\\" into doing so by Sampley's tactics. \\"I feel like I have a very strong belief in God.\\", said one. \\"But I don't like getting stuff like this crammed down my throat.\\" Personal life and death Sampley was married twice. He had two children by his first wife, Kiku Uehara, who was from Okinawa; the couple later divorced. Both Kiku and her daughter with Sampley predeceased him. Later he married Robin Owen, daughter of Army officer Robert Owen, who went missing in Laos in 1968. They had a son together before divorcing in the 1990s. Sampley continued to wear the POW/MIA bracelet with his former father-in-law's name on it afterwards. Sampley died on May 12, 2009, at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, of complications from heart surgery. He was interred at Dyson Cemetery in Ivanhoe, with full military honors.

According to the labor theory, an individual has a right to the product of their labor, whether physical or intellectual. It is based on the John Locke's labor theory of property which says that persons are entitled to the fruits of their own labor, and by extension, intellectual property can be viewed as the fruits of an individual's mental labor. While the Lockean theory was originally intended for conventional forms of property, it can be extended to justify intellectual property in general and copyright in particular if we view an owner's claim to traditional forms of property as being analogous to an author's claims over their intellectual property.  History and development  The labor theory is grounded in the Lockean idea of property which states that if you mix your labor with some resource that was commonly and freely available, or expend your labor generally, then you extend some part of yourself to the final product and therefore it should be yours. In doing so, you exclude anyone else's title to anything that contains your labor.Peter S. Menell, 'Intellectual Property: General Theories', in Encyclopedia of Law & Economics: Volume II, ed. by Boudewijn Bouckaert and Gerrit de Geest (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2000), pp. 129-88. Thus, Locke argues that \\"the 'labor' of his body and 'work' of his hands ... are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his labor with it and joined to it something that is his own and thereby makes it his own property\\". Locke, however, puts two caveats to this theory of property. First, in order to justify property rights using the labor theory, you have to show that the 'non-waste' requirement is fulfilled, which means that the author should not take up more of the common resources available than they can fruitfully use ‚Äî i.e. there should not be any waste of common resources. Second, there is the 'enough and as good' requirement which states that when the author/creator of a work acquires something from the common resources then they should make sure that such acquisition does not impair or infringe any other persons ability to make use these common resources.  Justification of copyright on the basis of the labor theory  The labor theory of copyright is one of the most prominent theories of copyright, among others like the Incentive and the Personhood Theories. One reason for its popularity and widespread use in the justification of copyright law is that the arguments used in this theory have been part of the jurisprudential discourse on intellectual property for a long time. This is especially true in jurisdictions such as the United States, where these arguments have found basis in several legislations and constitutional provisions.  Opposition to the labor theory  Several arguments have been made against the labor theory, with critics pointing out that property cannot be mixed with actions, and if original labor is important in the creation of a work, then any other use of that work or subsequent labor should be given the same rights as those given to the original author. These theories represent a more traditional justification of Intellectual property, which may be of diminishing relevance to present-day circumstances. Some critics, for example, question the very idea of having or owning property when talking about intellectual property. They argue that the works of authors should not be viewed as commodities to be owned but as a means of 'communication'.  Treatment in different jurisdictions  The idea of rewarding authors for their labor was initially prominent in the United States jurisprudence, with many arguing that American society is based on the idea that people are entitled to enjoy the fruits of their labor in that they create something that has value. In the case of Mazer v. Stein Justice Stanley Forman Reed of the U.S. Supreme Court said that \\"sacrificial days devoted to ... creative activities deserves rewards commensurate with the services rendered\\". Justice Potter Stewart observed that \\"the immediate effect of our copyright law is to stimulate a fair return for an author's creative labor\\". While this concept was initially defended in a number of cases, it was ultimately rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co. In this case, the court considered one of the most prominent conceptions of the labor theory in copyright: the 'sweat of the brow' theory or the 'industrious collection' theory, which states that if labor has been put into the creation of a work, then it should be the property of the author.

It is often called, incorrectly, Senecio peregrinus, but that name was previously given, by Grisebach in 1879, to a different species from South America.The Plant List The name Curio √ó peregrinus was published in 1999, based on the earlier name Kleinia peregrina; however, this name was not validly published. The plant is a hybrid between Curio rowleyanus and Curio articulatus. Description Reaching a height of 15 cm (6 inches) tall, the plant's curvy leaves develop two small points which make it look like a pod of coltish dolphins. It blooms from May to June. The flowers are mincing and white in colour, forming clenched puffballs. Each bloom has a halo of blood red to golden yellow filaments.Senecio peregrinus (Dolphin Necklace) Cultivation The plant thrives under bright, indirect light with some morning sun and in semi-shade under moist conditions. Not frost tolerant and preferring warmer weather, the plant may become sunburned from incessant sun exposure. The plant does well in hanging baskets, where its leaves can shower downward. Under good conditions, the plant can grow over 50 cm in the first year. The plant may be fertilised once or twice a year to heighten new growth and its general health. The plant can be propagated through cuttings.Adorable Succulents‚Äô Leaves Look Like Tiny Dolphins Jumping in the Air by Sara Barnes Novelty The plant was a fashion trend in 2017, creating a furore in Japan after a Twitter account posted the plant, where it ultimately got 10.5k retweets.Twitter post See also *Curio 'Trident Blue', a similar looking hybrid References peregrinus Succulent plants House plants Ornamental plant cultivars Hybrid plants ","title":"Curio √ó peregrinus"},{"id":"60594167","text":"St. Boswells Rugby Football Club are a rugby union side in the small village of St Boswells in the Borders, Scotland.

She was the best two-year-old filly in Japan in 2014 when she won her last three races including the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies and was the unanimous choice for the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Filly. Her later career was badly disrupted by injury and made only three disappointing appearances over the next three seasons. Background Shonan Adela is a bay mare with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Hokkaido, Japan by the Shimokobe Farm. During her racing career she was owned by Tetsuhide Kunimoto and trained by Yoshitaka Ninomiya. She was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Shonan Adela's dam Always Willing was bred in Kentucky and won minor race in the United States before being bought for $310,000 by Shimokobe Farm in November 2009 and exported to Japan in the following year. Always Willing's dam Always Loyal won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and was a half-sister to Anabaa. Racing career =2014: two- year-old season= Shonan Adela began her racing career by finishing a close second to the colt Navion in a 1600-metre event over 1600 metres at Niigata Racecourse on 3 August. After a two-month break she returned for a maiden race over the same distance at Tokyo Racecourse and recorded her first success as she won from Meisho Sawayaka and sixteen others. The filly followed up in the Karamatsu Sho over 1400 metres at the same track, winning by half a length from the colt Daitokyo. At Hanshin Racecourse on 14 December Shonan Adela was stepped up to Grade 1 class for the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies, Japan's most prestigious race for two-year-old females, and started at odds of 8.8/1. Roca was made favourite ahead of Let's Go Donki, Caught Charmant (Rindo Sho) and Kokorono Ai (Artemis Stakes) in an eighteen-runner field. Ridden by Masayoshi Ebina Shonan Adela started slowly and raced towards the rear of the field before making a forward move on the final turn. She was switched to the outside in the straight and produced a strong late run to catch Let's Go Donki in the final strides and win by half a length. Ebina commented \\"She didn't break well, but I decided to keep cool and take this opportunity to race her from a little further back than usual. Just as I had anticipated, she had a great late speed and although she was a bit green when crowded by other fillies, we were able to come out following the runner-up for a clear run. I knew that she could make it once we hit the gas\\". In January 2015 Shonan Adela was named Best Two-Year-Old Filly at the JRA Awards for 2014, being the unanimous choice of the 285 voters. =Later career= After being kept off the track by injury for the spring and summer of 2015, Shonan Adela was expected to begin her second season in the Rose Stakes in September but sustained a leg fracture in training and missed the rest of the season. Shonan Adela belatedly returned for the Victoria Mile in 2016 at Tokyo on 15 May. Running for the first time in seventeen months she started a 34/1 outsider and came home sixteenth of the eighteen runners, seventeen lengths behind the winner Straight Girl. On her only other start of the year she finished sixth behind Win Full Bloom in a Listed race at Fukushima Racecourse on 24 July. The mare returned for one final run in April 2017 when she finished last of the sixteen runners behind Logi Chalice in the Grade 3 Lord Derby Challenge Trophy at Nakayama Racecourse.

Background  The case centered on the robbery of the Parkway Filling Station in Palmerstown on the 18th January 1998. The applicant, Robert Dunne, was charged with the robbery. Brian Torley, the owner of the filling station stated that the filling station was covered by video camera surveillance.[2002] 2 IR 305 at 308. Torley failed to recall whether the Garda√≠ requested or obtained video tapes of the robbery. The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Garda Denis Kenny, admitted that no video tape of the events that occurred at the Parkway Filling Station was given to or obtained by any member of the Garda S√≠ochana.[2002] 2 IR 305 at 315. The only evidence presented against the applicant was an alleged written statement. It was argued that the failure to preserve the video recording for the applicant to view should be considered a breach of Garda obligation to preserve evidence potentially relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the applicant. Arguing in favor of refusing the relief sought, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) stated Dunne had been guilty of delay in seeking judicial review.  Supreme Court Decision  The Supreme Court granted the appeal and subsequently made an order of prohibition. It was held that: # An accused person had a constitutional right to a fair trial # The applicant had not delayed in seeking the videos # It was the duty of the Garda√≠ to seek out and preserve all evidence having a bearing or potential bearing on the issue of guilt or innocence In his judgment, Hardiman J referred to his prior ruling in Braddish v DPP[2001] IESC 45, [2001] 3 IR 127. where he initially stated: > \\"It is the duty of the Gardai, arising from their unique investigative role, > to seek out and preserve all evidence having a bearing or potential bearing > on the issue of guilt or innocence.\\"[2001] 3 IR 127 at 133. As there was no evidence that the Garda√≠ ever possessed the video tapes alleging to show to accused committing the robbery in question, there could not be a question of a failure to preserve that evidence. The most important aspect to consider was whether the Garda√≠ had failed in their duty to \\"seek out\\" evidence which had \\"a bearing or potential bearing on the issue of guilt or innocence.\\" Endorsing the use of new technology in efforts to prevent crime, Hardiman J. noted that science and technology can provide more certainty in important matters that should not be merely judged by humans. He pointed towards the repeated use of new technology in furthering the prevention of crime for the greater good, even when the processes involved can be seen to be somewhat intrusive to innocent people.[2002] 2 IR 305 at 310. = Concurrences = In his concurrence, McGuinness J stated that: > \\"Where the court was asked to prohibit a trial on the grounds that there was > an alleged failure to seek out evidence, it would have to be shown that any > such evidence would be clearly relevant, that there was at least a strong > probability that the evidence was available and that it would in reality > have a bearing on the guilt or innocence of the accused person.\\"[2002] 2 IR > 305 at 306. = Dissents = Fennelly J, dissenting in part, noted his concerns on imposing such a duty on Garda√≠ in relation to seeking out evidence. It represents a \\"very significant new step in the law\\"[2002] 2 IR 305 at 343. and that there is a danger that \\"there will develop a tendency to shift the focus of criminal prosecution on to the adequacy of the police investigation rather than the guilt or innocence of the accused.\\"[2002] 2 IR 305 at 344. Referring to the judgment of Hardiman J in Braddish v DPP[2001] 3 IR 127. it was reiterated that such a duty: > \\"Cannot be interpreted as requiring the Garda√≠ to engage in a > disproportionate commitment of manpower or resources in an exhaustive search > for every conceivable kind of evidence. The duty must be interpreted > realistically on the facts of each case.\\"[2001] 3 IR 127 at 135.  Subsequent Developments  The ruling in this case was later affirmed in the 2003 Supreme Court case of Bowes v DPP.[2003] IESC 9, [2003] 2 IR 25.

The first grammarian of al-K≈´fah was Al-Ru'ƒÅsƒ´ who lived in the eighth century, whereas the earliest scholars of the School at Ba·π£rah, lived during the seventh century. The great intellectual project that developed out of both schools of philology, created the sciences of Arabic grammar and lexicography. What emerged from an impetus to interpret the sacred texts of the Qu‚ÄôrƒÅn and ·∏§adƒ´th, by humanists of al- Ba·π£rah and al-K≈´fah, led to a communal quest for the purest, least corrupt, Arabic source material, for which they turned to the Pre-Islamic oral poetry as recited by the rƒÅwƒ´. The compositions of famous poets were collected, arranged, and committed to writing. The grammarians of al-Ba·π£rah and al-K≈´fah collected the ancient Arabian poetry and arranged the material into ‚ÄúDƒ´wƒÅn‚Äù (pl. DawƒÅwan) according to certain principles; either by classes of individuals, tribal groupings, selected qa·π£ƒ´das, or by themes of fragments, and edited into anthologies.

In 1958, Clarke left a career in neurology to pursue one in history of medicine. In 1965, he was a member of the founding committee that established the British Society for the History of Medicine. His publications included a series of monographs on the history of the neurosciences. Early life and education Edwin Clarke was born in Felling-on-Tyne, County Durham, to Joseph Clarke, an artisan. He was educated at Jarrow Central School and subsequently became apprenticed in pharmacy at the dispensary of the Newcastle General Hospital from 1935 to 1938. He simultaneously took evening classes at Rutherford Technical College. In 1939, he gained admission to King's College medical school at the University of Durham, in Newcastle. Early medical training and career During the Second World War, a Rockefeller Foundation funded scheme allowed Clarke to travel to the United States as one of around seventy medical students from the United Kingdom chosen to complete fast-track clinical training. In 1943, he began his studies at the University of Chicago, which he completed in 1945. When he returned to Durham in 1945, he took his MB BS and subsequently received his Chicago MD in 1946. Clarke completed his postgraduate posts at Oxford with Sir Hugh Cairns and E. M. Buzzard, and in the Royal Army Medical Corps for a further two years with a specialism in neurology (1946 to 1948). He subsequently worked for Charles Symonds at the National Hospital, Queen Square before joining Sir John McMichael's medical department as lecturer and consultant neurologist at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith. History of medicine Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Library In 1958, Clarke switched career, left clinical work and became assistant scientific secretary to the Wellcome Trust. Between 1960 and 1962, he spent time at the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, followed by some time at the University of California at Los Angeles, and then a year as visiting associate professor at Yale University. In 1963, Clarke returned to England from the United States and joined the staff of the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Library before it became the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. In 1965, he represented the History of Medicine Society on the committee who established the British Society for the History of Medicine, along with William Copeman, Haldane Philp Tait, K. D. Keele, D. Geraint James, Douglas Guthrie, F. N. L. Poynter and Charles Newman, becoming its first honorary assissistant secretary. In 1966, history of medicine was encouraged as an academic subject and the Wellcome Trust appointed Clarke as senior lecturer and head of the sub-department of the history of medicine at University College London. Clarke researched the structure, functions and diseases of the nervous system and with various co-authors, he created a series of monographs on the history of the neurosciences. In 1971, he edited Modern Methods in the History of Medicine, a collection of essays. He was not completely at ease with the growing trend to apply a social context to medical history but his work in the history of medicine was still described as \\"seminal\\" and his scholarship as exhibiting \\"timeless qualities of accuracy and care\\". In 1973, he succeeded Poynter to become Director of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, when he oversaw the reorganisation of the Wellcome building at Euston Road, particularly the transfer of the Wellcome museum to the Science museum. At the same time, he also became editor of the journal Medical History and contributed to the establishment of an Intercalated BsC Degree in History of Medicine at University College, providing medical students the chance to study history of medicine in depth, for one year. His desire was to establish history of medicine as an academic discipline and not just interested amateurs. He retired as director in 1979. Personal life Clarke was described as \\"a difficult man to get close to\\" but as having \\"impressive rhythm on the dance floor at Institute parties\\". He married three times and had two sons and a daughter. Clarke died on 11 April 1996 from pancreatic carcinoma. Selected publications Clarke's books included: * The Human Brain and Spinal Cord.

Early life and education Arthur Johnson was born to Swan Johnson and Margaret Elizabeth Nelson Johnson in 1862 on a farm near Swan Lake Minnesota. His birth location is listed as St. Peter, Minnesota on other records. He had one brother, Franklin Oliver Johnson, who also served as an officer. He entered the United States Military Academy in 1881 and graduated 61st out of a class of 77 in 1886. Military service Following graduation from USMA, Johnson commissioned into the infantry and performed frontier duty with the 11th and 17th Infantry Regiments on the frontier in Arizona. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he commanded the 12th Infantry Regiment, which participated in the siege and surrender of Santiago, Cuba. Johnson would later serve in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. From 1901 to 1908, he held a variety of posts commanding small units within the US and abroad. In 1908 to 1909, he attended the Army Service Schools and later the Army War College. Following that, he was promoted to Major on November 1st, 1901 and assigned a battalion of the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines. Following his service in the Philippines, he instructed and inspected the Minnesota Militia until September 2, 1913, when he was transferred to Texas. Johnson was moved from Texas to Minnesota and back until he was assigned to the 36th Infantry Division on August 11, 1916. Johnson took command of the division on May 15th, 1917, concurrent with his promotion to a colonel. World War I On November 1917, Johnson was sent to Paris as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. He took command of an intermediate section of the Service of Supply. During his command, he received the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Honour for efficiently utilizing female labor in Nevers, France. On April 12, 1918, he was promoted to Brigadier General. Postwar and retirement Johnson was reverted to the rank of Colonel on March 15, 1920. He retired on July 9th, 1925.

She co-founded the Insight Yoga Institute and created Insight Yoga, a combination of yoga, transpersonal psychology and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy, described in her 2008 book of the same name. She was closely involved with the creation of Yin Yoga. Life =Early life= Sarah Powers began yoga in 1986 at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, as a component of her degree there. Her career was driven by a life-changing accident in a yoga class led by \\"a senior yoga teacher\\". The teacher instructed the class to begin with Sirsasana, yoga headstand without warm-up preliminaries. From there the woman suggested the class drop straight into a headstand backbend (Dvi Pada Viparita Dandasana, an advanced pose, rated 24 by B. K. S. Iyengar). Powers, \\"with the lethal combination of a bendy back mixed with unbridled enthusiasm to try new things\\", complied. The teacher asked them to do it again, and as Powers lifted her legs from the backbend, her lower back gave an audible crack and a searing pain from a vertebral subluxation in the lumbar region. Recovery was lengthy, involving \\"chiropractors and acupuncturists\\". She lost the ability to perform such advanced backbends, but learnt therapeutic yoga under T. K. V. Desikachar and Gary Kraftsow. The injured back led her to try the gentler Yin Yoga under the instruction of Paul Grilley. =Career= Powers began teaching yoga in 1987. In 2008 she created Insight Yoga, a combination of modern yoga, transpersonal psychology and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy including Chinese meridian theory, co-founding the Insight Yoga Institute with Ty Powers. Insight Yoga's style is a blend of the soft, slow and gentle Yin Yoga, a name that she devised, with a more typical \\"hatha yoga\\" practice, that she calls Yang (harder) by contrast, influenced by schools such as Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. She has given workshops at the Esalen Institute and other centres around the world. She was identified by Yoga Journal as one of the people who had \\"each, independently, discovered the benefits of merging mindfulness with asana\\", leading to \\"something we might call 'mindful yoga'.\\" =Personal life= She is married with Ty Powers, who she met when aged 18. They have a daughter and live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Insight Yoga Insight Yoga, introduced by Powers's 2008 book of that name, balances Yin Yoga with conventional 'Yang' yoga, and integrates both with Chinese Medicine, in particular its meridian lines, and with the Vipassana meditation style of Buddhism, emphasising mindfulness. Powers describes the integration with Chinese Medicine as making her yoga practice more skilful, \\"like learning to be my own personal acupuncturist‚Äîonly without the needles\\".

His long stay in Turkey, theological training, and possibly age, may have unfitted him to rule. Most of the fighting was done by his brother Alp Giray. He was one of the many sons of Devlet I Giray. His reign was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of his nephew Saadet, and much of his reign was spent in conflict with Saadet and his brothers, the sons of his murdered brother and predecessor, Mehmed II Giray. Unlike many Crimean khans he died of natural causes. Early life The year of his birth is not given. After his father Devlet I Giray came to the throne in 1551, Islyam was sent to the Sultan‚Äôs court as a rekhin or kind of honorary hostage. Girays living in Istanbul could be put on the Crimean throne if the ruling khan was disobedient. He spent more than 30 years of his life in Turkey and at some point left the Ottoman court for the Mevlevi Order of Sufis at Konya where he engaged in prayer, meditation and theological study. The Russian Wikipedia has him go to a Dervish ‚Äòmonastery‚Äô at Bursa in 1574. Accession In 1584 his elder brother Khan Mehmed II Giray refused a Turkish order to lead the Crimeans on a distant campaign to Persia. Murad III recalled Islyam and declared him the new Crimean Khan. The Sultan‚Äôs reasons were probably that Islyam was the eldest Giray after Mehmed and that his long stay in Turkey and lack of military experience would make him a tractable vassal. In May 1584 Islyam arrived at Kaffa with Turkish soldiers and was joined by his brothers Alp, Selyamet and Mubarek and most of the Crimean nobles including the Shirin clan. Mehmed, his sons (below) and the pro-Nogai Mansur clan leaders fled toward the steppe seeking Nogai support. Near Perekop Alp caught up with Mehmed and had him strangled. Islyam with Turkish troops marched to Bakhchisarai and took the throne. Alp became his kalga and Mubarak his nureddin. Saadet‚Äôs rebellion When Mehmed died his sons were Saadet II Giray, Murad and Safa. Three months after Islyam‚Äôs accession, seeking revenge for their murdered father, Saadet and his brothers led 15000 Nogais, 230 Don Cossacks and the Mansur bey southward. There was no defending army because most of the beys and mirzas had gathered at Bakhchiserai to make arrangements for the new reign. They defended the capital for seven days and then broke up. Under cover of darkness Islyam fled southwest through the hill country to Balaklava and took ship to the Turkish garrison at Kaffa. He was joined by his brothers Alp and Selyamet who had traveled by land. Saadet seized the royal treasury and headed east toward Kaffa. Because of his victory and possession of the treasury many beys joined him. At the old capital of Stary Krym the beys proclaimed him khan. At some point he was joined by some Kumyks. The Zaporozhian Cossacks offered to fight for pay, but this plan was overtaken by events. Saadet marched south and besieged Kaffa. Saadet could not break the walls and the garrison could not deal with the Nogai cavalry. Islyam appealed to the Turks. After a two and a half month siege 4000 Jannisaries arrived in galleys. Alp opened the gate and the Turkish artillery drove back the Nogai horse. There was a bloody battle at the river Indol near Stary Krym. Saadet was defeated and fled. In the summer of the following year (1585) Saadet tried again but was defeated by Alp Giray before he reached Perekop. On the steppe The three brothers were now in danger since any bold chieftain might seize them and sell them to Islyam. Saadet and his younger brother Safa fled east to refuge with Chopan, the shamkhal of the Kumyks on the Caspian Sea. Chopan probably wanted a bargaining chip to protect his independence, since in the last reign Turkish and Crimean troops had several times marched through his lands to attack the Persians. The Shah of Persia was happy with Saadet‚Äôs arrival and sent him a decorated saber which he suggested by used against the Turks. See Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1578‚Äì90). Another source has Safa go first to Cherkassia, then to the Kumyks in autumn 1586 and later refuse cooperation with the Russians. :ru:–°–∞–∞–¥–µ—Ç II –ì–µ—Ä–∞–π and :ru:–°–∞—Ñ–∞ –ì–µ—Ä–∞–π (–∫–∞–ª–≥–∞). The source seems to be the Vinogradov papers noted in the Safa article. Not in Gaivoronsky. Murad chose a stronger protector and went to the Russians at Astrakhan. The Russians hoped to use him as a puppet khan just as they had done at Kazan. Murad went to Moscow in the spring of 1586, was shown great honor and returned to Astrakhan in September. He affected royal airs and called himself 'Lord of the Four Rivers\\" (Don, Volga, Ural and Terek), but was closely watched by the Russians. He was told to unite the Nogais, Kabardians and Kumyks against Crimea and Turkey. Urus Bey of the Nogais submitted very reluctantly and sent a complaint to the sultan. In the spring of 1587 Islyam heard that the czar had sent Murad 30000 streltsi and Cossacks in preparation for an attack on Crimea at the end of the year. In response, Alp and Selyamet made a raid on the Oka (1587). The Russians claimed success, but the raid reduced their support for Murad. The Russians pretended that they had sent the men to fight the Poles, not the Crimeans. Unhappy with Murad‚Äôs demands, Urus- Bey sent an ambassador to the sultan offering to become a Turkish subject and receive a Turkish governor, asking for Adil Giray‚Äôs fort of Bola-Serai to replace Saraichik which the Volga Cossacks had destroyed and proposed a new Turkish campaign to liberate Astrakhan. Some time before the Sultan had received a proposal from Bukhara for a joint attack on Astrakhan to open up communications north of the Caspian. Both were at war with Persia. The vizier Piyale-Pasha visited both Bukhara and the Nogais and reported that the capture of Astrakhan was feasible. The sultan ordered Urus and Islyam to prepare for a Volga campaign in the spring of 1588. Islyam would be in charge. Piyale-Pasha began filling Kaffa with food and equipment. (When Islyam died in 1588 the campaign was cancelled, the Turkish troops were sent to the Persian front and the galleys returned to the Mediterranean.) At this time Murad had gone to the Kumyks to marry the Shamkhal‚Äôs daughter and bring him into the Russian orbit, while Saadet moved from Kumykia to Astrakhan. It was learned in Crimea that a certain Khoja-bey had left Istanbul, bypassed Crimea and landed at Azov with messages for Saadet and Murad. We do not know what was said, but a few weeks later Saadet was found dead at Astrakhan. It is thought that the Russians had him murdered, fearing that he might go over to the Turks. The whole business remains mysterious. In Crimea After Saadet‚Äôs expulsion the Jannisaries were rather rough with his supporters which made Islyam unpopular. There was a problem with Alp since he had long been in Crimea, had military experience and would probably have made a better khan. Islyam had difficulty imposing himself since his subjects might to go over to the three brothers if he did anything unpopular. Less than a month after Alp‚Äôs 1587 campaign, Islyam and his younger brother Fetikh went of Gozleve/Evpatoria on some business. The Turks there complained that they could not reach Crimea by land because the Cossacks were raiding and had destroyed fort of Ak-Chakum (apparently Ochakiv at the mouth of the Dnieper estuary). While he was there the Cossacks looted seventeen villages on the northwest coast of Crimea and disappeared before Islyam could do anything. The sultan sent a blunt letter hinting that he knew what to do with a khan who could not defend their northern frontier. He also ordered Islyam to make a retaliatory campaign against the Poland which, in theory, controlled Zaporozhian Cossacks. That winter Islyam started his only military campaign,Gaivoronsky does not explain how this was related to the planned Astrakhan campaign above. along with his brothers Alp and Fetikh. He was to join the Turkish army at Akkerman and do something that is not explained. The campaign failed from the start. He had to coerce a number of subjects who did not want to join him. Because of an unusually warm winter they had to spend a month on the Dnieper waiting for it to freeze. When he got to Akkerman he found that the Turks, who had been waiting for him since autumn, had dispersed because of his delay. He was therefore forced to wait at Akkerman until they came back. In March 1588, at that city, he died of natural causes. He was buried in the walls to the Akkerman mosque. The beys who were with Islyam chose Alp Giray as the new khan. They sent to Istanbul for confirmation, but the sultan chose Gazi II Giray (1588‚Äì1608).

The phrase ‚Äúconsanguineous affection‚Äù was popularized by scholar Liu Qingping in a series of essays written throughout the 2000s, and it has since become a major focus of current debates over the correlation between Confucian ethics and trends of corruption in modern Chinese society. While the term ‚Äúconsanguinity‚Äù simply refers to the blood relations shared between family members and their ancestors, many interpret it within the context of Confucianism to imply that these bonds serve as the supreme value on which all moral decisions should be based. Origins =In modern Chinese philosophy= The concept of consanguinism developed from a series of essays written by Liu Qingping in the early 2000s. In a 2007 paper published in Chinese philosophical journal Dao, Liu claims that the concept of ‚Äúconsanguineous affection‚Äù is a ‚Äúdistinctive spirit of Confucianism‚Äù that is vital to achieving the Confucian goal of ‚Äúsagehood‚Äù. This assertion drew a lot of attention as a key part of a larger debate on modern Confucian ethics that has continued through today. As Liu defines it, consanguinism has two ‚Äúessential elements‚Äù. The first element is the widely understood idea that Confucians regard filial piety as a basis for human life and relationships. The second element is the belief that Confucians view the value of filial piety as paramount and place it above all other virtues when faced with an ethical dilemma. In the same 2007 issue of Dao, a response to Liu Qingping's critique of Confucian ethics was published by prominent New Confucian Guo Qiyong. As a result of Guo's own importance in the Chinese Philosophy community, he and his essay (titled ‚ÄúIs Confucian Ethics a ‚ÄòConsanguinism‚Äô‚Äù) brought this term and the debates surrounding it to the forefront of Modern Chinese philosophical discussion. =In the Analects and Mencius= Although never directly used in either of the texts, the concepts behind the term ‚Äúconsanguinism‚Äù can be traced back the ideas of filial piety discussed in traditional Confucian writings. In both the Analects and Mencius, multiple passages are dedicated to illustrating the importance of family ties in the Confucian code of ethics. In Analects 1.2, Confucius‚Äô disciple You Rou states that ‚Äúfilial piety and brotherly respect are the root of humaneness‚Äù. This claim is also supported by Confucius himself in section 1.6 when he adds that ‚Äúa youth should be filial at home and be respectful to his elders abroad‚Äù. Similar emphasis on kinship bonds is provided throughout the Mencius. In section 4A27, Mencius claims that the substance of humaneness and righteousness can be found in serving one's parents and older brothers. The Mencius also asserts that consanguinity should be taken as the sole root of all human life. Liu references these and many other passages in his discussions of the modern idea of consanguineous affection and uses them to show how deeply rooted the concept is in traditional Confucianism. Debates surrounding consanguinism The correspondence between Liu Qingping and Guo Qiyong in the 2007 issue of Dao sparked a larger debate in the realm of Modern Chinese Philosophy regarding the apparent relationship between the code of ethics laid out in Confucian texts and the presence of corruption and nepotism in Chinese society. At the center of this debate is the use of the term ‚Äúconsanguinism‚Äù to describe the nature of Confucian values. This topic has become one of the most prominent discussions in the realm of Modern Chinese philosophy, extending not only to various Chinese philosophers, but also to the wider community of scholars of Chinese philosophy around the world. =Consanguinism as a criticism of Confucianism= Critics of Confucian virtues use the idea of consanguinism to expose the ethical priorities that many believe are implied throughout various Confucian texts and teachings. Most of these critics‚Äîparticularly Liu Qingping‚Äîbelieve that Confucians treat the concept of consanguineous affection as a supreme virtue that takes precedence over every other principle of life. Liu has also compared this tenet to the Christian idea of maintaining faith in God over everything, claiming Confucians see filial piety as the root of humaneness and therefore cannot criticize anyone acting under accordance with this principle even if they violate other Confucian virtues. In response to more commonly accepted interpretations of Confucian texts that argue that the concepts of benevolence and humaneness are of more significance than filial piety, critics claims that such interpretations directly contradict cases in which Mencius and Confucius promote loyalty to family rather than commitment to greater societal justice. Particularly, in several moral discussions featured throughout Mencius, the sage king Shun‚Äîregarded as a model for proper human behavior and benevolence‚Äîis said to have chosen to support family members rather than strictly uphold the law. Critics cite these arguments as evidence that Confucian ethics contribute to trends of nepotism and corruption within contemporary Chinese society because they can be viewed as justification for such behavior (Liu 2007). =Defense of Confucianism= In a response to various essays written by Liu Qingping criticizing Confucianism, Guo Qiyong argues that the understanding of consanguine love as the root of humaneness is the result of a misinterpretation of Confucian texts. Guo places more emphasis on Mencius‚Äô discussions of the human heart-mind and its innate tendency towards good as the root of human behavior, citing the story of a person inclined to save a child from falling into a well because it is his immediate gut-reaction to do so. According to various Confuician and Neo-Confucian scholars, things born from heaven and from the heart-mind are the true root of Confucian ethics, and therefore it is filial piety that is the result of the greater Confucian concern for humanity rather than uprightness being the product of practicing filial piety. Stephen Angle proposes the additional idea that, while some Confucian virtues can be viewed as more important than others, it is most appropriate to take a situational approach to analyzing their importance in order to achieve harmony within various contexts. Angle points out the emphasis in Confucianism on avoiding ‚Äúeither/or‚Äù decisions and argues that harmony should not be interpreted as ‚Äúa tradeoff between two competing values‚Äù. This analysis is used to support the idea that consanguine affection is not the supreme virtue of Confucianism, but rather a situationally important one. Other defenses of Confucianism argue that corruption related to familial ties is not a phenomenon specific to modern China. In a piece written with Guo Qiyong, Gong Jianping argues that the refusal to report crimes as an attempt to protect family members is a situation that has been observed all over the world all throughout history. He points out that in ancient Greece, the act of revealing the crimes of family members was believed to anger the Gods, while in some modern European countries, there are laws that give people the option to refuse to testify against a family member in court. Gong believes that the corruption observed in contemporary China is not so much a product of Confucian values, but rather a product of a natural human inclination to protect blood relatives  References  Confucianism ","title":"Consanguinism"},{"id":"60594679","text":"Jean-Pierre Wafflard (born 27 December 1968) is a Belgian wrestler.

It won the World Fantasy Award in 2018 and is the first in the Green Bone Saga trilogy. It was followed by Jade War in 2019. Jade Legacy, the third and final book in the series, is expected to be released in 2021. Setting and inspiration Lee describes the novel as \\"The Godfather with magic and kung fu\\" and cites her love of wuxia and gangster films as inspirations. The titular Jade City is a nickname for Janloon, the capital of the island of Kekon in the novel's secondary world setting. One reviewer described Kekon as \\"an analog of mid-20th-century Hong Kong\\" although Lee has alluded to the setting being inspired by Asia more generally, stating that Kekon is not \\"Hong Kong or Taiwan or Japan or China or any of those places.\\" She has stated that one of her goals for the novel was to \\"write an epic fantasy that was not set in medieval Europe,\\" featuring \\"the scheming and politics and clash of noble houses elements\\" in a \\"different cultural setting but also different time period.\\" =Clans= The events of Jade City take place a generation after the end of the Many Nations War, a conflict roughly analogous to World War II, during which the One Mountain Society, a national liberation movement, successfully fought to end foreign occupation of Kekon. After the war, a dispute over opening Kekon to international trade led to the One Mountain Society disintegrating into a number of rival clans, with the most powerful being the isolationist Mountain clan led by the Ayt family and the internationalist No Peak clan led by the Kaul family. The organization of the clans is similar to the crime families in The Godfather, in which the Corleone family has a don, underboss and consigliere; the clans each have a Pillar, Horn and Weather Man. The Pillar is the head of the clan, the Horn leads its street fighters and the Weather Man is responsible for business activities. The Horn oversees the clan's Fists, who each command a number of Fingers, similar to caporegimes and soldiers in the American Mafia. Unlike in the Mafia, the Weather Man manages an office in the business district, staffed by clan members known as Luckbringers. Outside of the family but still part of the clan are the Lantern Men, business owners who were civilian accomplices in the liberation movement. After the war they began to pay financial tribute to the clans in return for protection from criminal gangs of untrained jade users. Clan members who wear jade are known as Green Bones. They are governed by the aisho honor code, which prevents them from killing unjaded family members of their enemies except in very specific circumstances (clan informants who wear no jade are known as White Rats, and can be killed without violating aisho). =Jade= Kekon contains the world's only supply of jade, a mineral that endows its wearer with enhanced abilities. Safe use of jade requires a combination of genetic predisposition and intense training in the six disciplines of Strength, Steel, Perception, Lightness, Deflection and Channelling. Before writing Jade City, Lee received an MBA from Stanford, worked as a business strategist and wrote science fiction novels. She has stated that she \\"[treats] the magic almost in a science fictional way\\" and as \\"a way to have the international trade and politics play out in the storyline.\\" Jade is the only magical element in the novel, and while the Kekonese regard it as having mystical properties, the Westerners refer to it as \\"bioenergetic jade,\\" something explicable by science. An individual's response to jade is determined by their genetic makeup. The aboriginal population of Kekon, the Abukei, are completely immune to its effects, while individuals from outside Kekon are too sensitive to it. Only the Kekonese, with mixed aboriginal and settler ancestry, have the necessary combination of resistance and sensitivity to be able to use it long-term, although there are wide variations in jade ability among the population, for reasons not well understood. In addition, some Kekonese are born with a recessive genetic trait that makes them immune to jade. These individuals are known as \\"stone-eyes\\", and are considered unlucky by other Kekonese. Lee has commented that she tied jade ability to a combination of genetics and luck as \\"a way to subvert that trope of the blood talent... the chosen ones.\\" Kekonese jade users have to spend years in training at the clan academies to use it safely. Overexposure to jade leads to The Itches, a condition causing madness and eventual death. Jade tolerance can also be increased through injections of a drug called SN1 or \\"shine.\\" Shine is used as a medicine to treat Green Bones, and in addition is traded on the black market and used illicitly by Kekonese who want to wear jade but who do not have academy training. It is also used outside Kekon to facilitate military use of jade by non-Kekonese troops. Use and production of jade on Kekon is governed by various traditions and institutions. Green Bones are entitled to claim the jade from enemies they kill in combat. Jade use is supposed to be kept out of government, so members of the Royal Council of Kekon, a representative assembly with lawmaking powers, are banned from wearing it. Jade mining is overseen by the Kekon Jade Alliance (KJA), a private business consortium whose shares are split between the clans. The KJA makes allocations of jade to various organizations including the temples of Deitism, Kekon's main religion, where it is used in rituals. Characters =No Peak clan= * Lan (Kaul Lanshinwan): The recently-anointed Pillar, inheriting the role from his grandfather Kaul Sen. Lan's wife recently left him for another man, causing him to lose face in Kekon and affecting his confidence in his abilities. Despite this, he strives to be a strong leader for the clan. * Hilo (Kaul Hiloshudon): Horn and brother of the Pillar, a big- hearted, hot-headed street fighter who commands absolute loyalty from his subordinates. * Shae (Kaul Shaelinsan): The third Kaul sibling, Shae holds no position in the clan and wears no jade by choice, despite having completed her training at the Academy. After the breakup of her relationship with a non- Kekonese soldier, Shae returns to Kekon looking for a job outside the clan where she can put her foreign education to use. * Kaul Sen (Kaul Seningtun): Original clan Pillar, known as the Torch of Kekon for his actions during the battle for independence. Now retired and slipping into dementia, he is a shadow of the man he once was. * Kaul Wan Ria (Kaul Wan Riamasan) Daughter-in- law of Kaul Sen and mother of the Kaul siblings. Her husband died in the war and she takes no part in clan affairs. * Doru (Yun Dorupon): The aged, calculating Weather Man of No Peak, increasingly at odds with the younger generation now in charge of the clan. * Anden (Emery Anden): Adopted grandson of Kaul Sen, he is in his final year as a student at the Academy. * Wen (Maik Wenruxian): Sister of two prominent Fists of the No Peak clan, she is in a relationship with Hilo. She is a stone-eye. =Mountain clan= * Ayt Mada (Ayt Madashi): Ruthless Pillar who inherited the role by murdering the other contenders when her adoptive father Ayt Yugontin, the Spear of Kekon, died. * Gont Asch (Gont Aschentu): Fearsome, brutish Horn whose physical prowess masks hidden cunning. * Ree Tura (Ree Turahuo): Weather Man. Nearing retirement, he is not well-regarded by the Pillar or Horn. =Unaffiliated= * Bero: A minor street thief. Despite being untrained, he has ambitions to wear jade and doesn't mind how he gets it. * Mudt (Mudt Jindonon): A smuggler and informant who sells Bero's stolen merchandise through his discount goods store. Plot Bero, a minor thief, attempts to steal jade from a No Peak Fist while he is dining in a clan-affiliated restaurant, but Bero and his Abukei accomplice Sampa are quickly caught and brought to Hilo for punishment. After they are beaten, a remark by Sampa about a recent murder in clan territory leads Hilo to take the two boys to be questioned in the presence of his brother Lan, the clan Pillar. Hilo attempts to convince Lan that the Mountain clan is squeezing No Peak territory, but he is opposed by Doru the Weather Man, who suggests it is a misunderstanding and counsels a peaceful solution. Feeling frustrated and unsupported by Doru, Lan asks his grandfather for permission to replace him as Weather Man, but Kaul Sen refuses to allow it. A short time after this, Shae returns to Kekon, looking for a job that will not require her to wear jade. The Mountain comes close to violating aisho by kidnapping Anden, who is still in his final year at the Academy. Ayt Mada offers Anden a position in her clan, signalling that she wishes to unite the Mountain and No Peak. Her purpose is partially to send a message that she considers Hilo an unsuitable Horn. Once Anden has been returned safely, Lan begins to move against the Mountain. He proposes a new law preventing any one clan from gaining control of the Kekon Jade Alliance, and he sends Shae to audit the KJA's accounts, looking for irregularities. Their message to Anden having been disregarded, the Mountain makes an attempt on Hilo's life. In retaliation, No Peak threatens to storm their training complex. To prevent this, the Mountain apologizes, gives up the would-be assassins and makes a territorial concession. The more senior of the assassins offers Lan a clean blade, demanding to be killed in combat. Believing that he needs to prove himself to the clan in order to remain Pillar, Lan accepts and wins the duel, but only barely. In the aftermath, Hilo asks his brother for permission to marry his girlfriend Wen, and Lan, despite misgivings about his brother marrying a stone-eye from a disreputable family, gives his permission. Lan has been injured in the duel and his jade tolerance has been affected, but he cannot be seen to show weakness by failing to wear the additional jade he has won. He arranges for Anden to bring him packages of shine. When Anden realizes what he is delivering he pleads with Lan to stop using the drug, but Lan swears him to secrecy. When Shae comes to see Anden he tries to tell her about the shine, but misses his opportunity. Shae reports to Lan that someone in the KJA is skimming jade, and that either Doru doesn't know about it and is incompetent, or he is allowing it to happen. Lan sends Doru overseas to get him out of the way and tells his allies on the Royal Council that he is going to suspend jade production. Lan receives a letter from his estranged wife, but can't bring himself to open it. Meanwhile Bero has been stealing shipments from the Docks. Through his fence he meets a mysterious Mountain Green Bone, who gives Bero a submachine gun and tells him to use it to shoot up the gentleman's club Lan frequents. Lan accidentally takes an overdose of shine while visiting the club, and when Bero attacks him he falls into the sea and drowns. When Shae hears about his death she immediately goes to the bank where her jade is kept and puts it all back on. Hilo is now Pillar and she persuades him to strike back by reclaiming some disputed territory rather than launching an all-out attack on the Mountain. She takes part in the battle, fighting several Mountain Green Bones and killing two. Afterward, Hilo asks her to become his Weather Man and she agrees. She cements her position by gaining the support of her main rivals for the role, and she spares Doru's life on condition that he gives up his jade, renounces clan business and spends his remaining days as a companion for her grandfather. The clans are now in a state of open war. Shae and Hilo attend negotiations with Ayt Mada and her Weather Man until Hilo accuses the Mountain of skimming jade from the KJA and supplying it to non- Green Bones, then storms out. Ayt arranges to meet Shae on safe ground and tries to talk her into betraying No Peak, but Shae refuses, knowing that she is putting her life in serious jeopardy by doing so. She tells Hilo that No Peak can only hold out for another six months. Wen asks Shae to make her a spy for the clan, without Hilo's knowledge. Shae sends her to a foreign military base with a shipment of jade worth millions, re-establishing the supply that has been disrupted by the KJA's suspension of jade production. Kaul Sen gives his jade to Doru, and Doru uses it to attack his guards and escape, defecting to the Mountain with all his knowledge of No Peak's business dealings. The Mountain continues to use its superior position to maim and kill No Peak Green Bones. On New Year's Day, Hilo marries Wen, then has Anden drive him into Mountain territory to be killed in combat, in return for clemency for the remaining No Peak clan members. Hilo kills several Green Bones but is overwhelmed. When Gont Asch steps in to finish him, Hilo and Anden together kill the Horn of the Mountain. The fight leaves Anden in a coma. When he regains consciousness, he learns that the loss of its Horn has dealt the Mountain a serious blow and given No Peak a temporary advantage in the war. Anden returns to the Academy for his graduation ceremony, but when he is presented with his jade he declares he does not want to be a Green Bone. He tells Hilo he does not want a life of violence, and when the Pillar rebukes him Anden runs from the Academy to Lan's grave. Later, under cover of darkness, Bero also visits the grave. He is still looking for jade, and in the former Pillar's coffin there is a generous supply. Adaptation In August 2020, it was reported that Peacock is in developing a television series adaptation. The series is produced by Universal Television with Dave Kalstein serving as writer and executive producer, Breck Eisner serving as director and executive producer and Dean Georgaris as executive producer.

It was established to address poor working conditions and wage theft, widespread inequality and discrimination at the workplace. MTU has focused on achieving legal rights and recognition for undocumented migrants in South Korea.  History  = Prior to the MTU = Until the late 1990s, migrant workers support system existed in South Korea and focused on individual cases of human rights deprivations. With the implementation of Employment Permit System (EPS), many organizations formed migrant workers support movement from the perspective of labor unionism. Most foreign worker groups and labor unions that participated in Myeongdong Cathedral sit-in protests for migrant workers' rights such as Joint Committee for Migrant Workers in Korea (JCMK), agreed on the government's offer and ended their protests in early 2004. However, Migrant Branch with the Equality Trade Union (ETU-MB)did not accept the offer and continued their protest until November 2004. From ETU-MB's continued protest for migrant workers' rights as well as demand for a better employment system, ETU-MB split up from ETU and organized MTU in 2005, mainly led by migrant workers in the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon area. = Fight for Legal Recognition = The Seoul Regional Labor Administration initially rejected the migrant workers' application for official labor union recognition. The migrant workers filed a lawsuit, but the lower court upheld the first ruling and again denied the MTU legal recognition as a labor union. However, the appeals court subsequently sided with the plaintiffs, forwarding the case to the Supreme Court for a final ruling. While the South Korean Supreme Court kept the status of the labor union in limbo for eight years, the first six leaders of the Migrants' Trade Union‚Äîincluding Michael Catuira‚Äîwere deported from South Korea. Ten years after migrant workers first filed the lawsuit, the Korean Supreme Court decided in a landmark case and ruled in favor of the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants' Trade Union that even undocumented migrant workers can establish and join labor unions.  Criticism of the MTU  MTU is affiliated to the Seoul Regional Council of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, therefore it lacks a national support network of migrant workers. There are regional migrant support programs, but they are not necessarily specific to workers or labor unionism.

The station was owned by Noark Broadcasting and maintained studios at 200 West Center Street in Fayetteville. After going silent, the license was sold to George T. Hernreich, owner of Fort Smith's KFPW-TV (now KHBS), and modified for channel 29. The station re- emerged on December 5, 1977, as KTVP (now KHOG-TV). History On May 8, 1968, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued Noark a construction permit for channel 36, which would broadcast with an effective radiated power of 1,450 kW from Robinson Mountain.FCC History Cards for KGTO-TV (KTVP) The construction of the station featured a delay due to a short circuit in the station's transmission line and a dramatic situation in January 1969, when a 19-year-old engineer suffered frostbite and had to be rescued from atop the tower, then hospitalized. Channel 36 began telecasts as an NBC affiliate on February 8, though its NBC affiliation agreement stipulated no compensation for carrying network programs. By July, one of the partners in Noark, Weldon Stamps, pulled out, leaving the station owned by Paul Milam Sr. and Jr., E.J. Ball, and Tom Cowan. Noark also contended with a lease for faulty equipment that it had assumed from Oklahoma City's defunct KLPR-TV. Not long after signing on, KGTO found that the equipment from Visual Electronics Corporation was deficient and ceased making lease payments; in March 1971, a federal judge found that Visual knew the equipment was defective, a judgment reaffirmed the next year in appeals court in KLPR-TV, Inc., vs. Visual Electronics Corporation. As a non-interconnected station, KGTO was dependent on receiving the signal of other affiliates over-the-air for its own broadcasts. When KGTO invoked network non-duplication of other network affiliates on the Trans-Video cable system in Fayetteville in February 1971, viewers complained that the network feed from KGTO, now replacing other network affiliates on the cable system, was of poor quality. The next month, the NBC affiliate in Little Rock, KARK-TV, sued KGTO for $7,805 in unpaid fees for using KARK as a source of NBC programming, pursuant to an agreement between the stations. Another lawsuit followed in May, when film distributor Screen Gems sued Noark for over $25,000 over a reorganization into an investment company that affected contracts for movies and cartoons. After carrying some CBS programs previously, 1972 saw KGTO fully change affiliations from NBC to CBS, with Little Rock's KTHV-TV as its primary program source. The station continued to demonstrate further financial troubles by cutting back its schedule; on January 22, 1973, the station began signing on the air at 5:30 pm on weekdays. That May, Noark filed to sell the station to George T. Hernreich, who would convert it to a satellite of Fort Smith's KFPW-TV, which he owned. With the sale to Hernreich languishing at the FCC due to concerns over conduct at his KAIT-TV in Jonesboro, KGTO-TV went off the air December 23, 1973, with Hernreich stating he would have the station back on within 24 hours of receiving approval. In the meantime, equipment was stolen from the KGTO transmitter site on Robinson Mountain. The sale was consummated in 1975, and the FCC cleared Hernreich of character issues in February 1976. While Hernreich finally owned KGTO (which changed its call letters to KTVP on January 17, 1977), he soon found other issues. An entirely new transmission facility had to be built at Robinson Mountain due to damage and further theft. An application was made on February 21, 1976 for a new facility. However, Hernreich procured equipment designed for channel 29, not 36; stating that a change would \\"permit restoration of service quickly and save approximately $100,000 in additional capital\\", Hernreich requested channel 29 to be substituted for 36 at Fayetteville, requiring modifications to three other allotments regionally. On December 5, 1977, KTVP signed on the air on channel 29 as a satellite of Hernreich's KFPW- TV in Fort Smith. The two stations are today KHOG-TV and KHBS, respectively.

Roy A. was born in Clinton, Ontario, and spent 12 years in the printing trade in Beeton. In 1935 he purchased the Oakville Star, leaving two years later for Orono. His tenure lasted until the early 1950s, when his son Roy Clarence/Charles is listed as publisher in the March 1st, 1951 issue. Popular columns over the years have included ‚ÄúFarm Front‚Äù by John Russell, ‚ÄúYour Family counselor‚Äù by Anne Hirst, ‚ÄúChronicles of Ginger Farm‚Äù by Gwendoline D. Clarke and Arthur Black‚Äôs ‚ÄúBasic Black‚Äù. Featured comics included ‚ÄúJitter‚Äù by Arthur Pointer and ‚ÄúRegular Fellers‚Äù by Gene Byrnes, and the wartime issues are a fantastic resource, featuring full pages of 1940s era comics. The paper has historically reported on news for communities such as Clarke, Cowanville, Newtonville, Kirby, Kendal, Leskard, Newcastle, Tyrone and Wesleyville. Roy C. was a veteran of the Royal Canadian Navy in World War II, and an avid naturalist that has a butterfly garden named for him on the Orono Crown Lands. Roy took over for his father in 1951, publishing the paper until retiring in May 1995. He was a supporter of incorporation for the town in the 1960s, fought for a municipal water supply as a Police Trustee and won on his third attempt, and a long-time proponent of the Clarke Library Board, being involved with obtaining the Wadell house at the corner of Church and Centre Street for a public library. He was a member of Orono‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce, a founding member of the Clarington Concert Band, and spent much of his time after retirement helping the development of the Oak Ridges Morraine Trail. Roy C. was honoured by the town with Roy Forrester Day, on June 7th, 2009, months after passing away on January 25th, 2009. Roy C., founding publisher In April 1995 the paper was purchased by Troy Young. Young had made the pages of the newspaper during the early 1980s, as a hockey player and pictured with the Orono Scouts.

Lyrics > Sunday morning just at nine > Dan McGinty dressed so fine, > Stood looking at a very high stone wall, > When his friend, young Pat McCann, > Says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet five dollars, Dan, > I could carry you to the top without a fall.‚Äù So on his shoulders he took > Dan, > to climb the ladder he began, > And soon commenced to reach up near the top; > When McGinty, cute old rogue, > To win the five he did let go, > Never thinking just how far he‚Äôd have to drop. Down went McGinty to the > bottom of the wall, > And tho‚Äô he won the five, > he was more dead than alive; > Sure his ribs and nose and back were broke from getting such a fall, > Dressed in his best suit of clothes. From the hospital Mac went home, > When they fixed his broken bones, > To find he was the father of a child; > So to celebrate it right, > his friends he went to invite, > And soon he was drinking whiskey fast and wild. Then he waddled down the > street > in his Sunday suit so neat, > Holding up his head as proud as John the Great; > But in the sidewalk was a hole, > to receive a ton of coal, > That McGinty never saw till just too late. Down went McGinty to the bottom > of the hole, > Then the driver of the cart > gave the load of coal a start; > And it took us half an hour to dig McGinty from the coal, > Dress‚Äôd in his best suit of clothes. Now McGinty raved and swore, > About his clothes he felt so sore, > And an oath he took he‚Äôd kill the man or die; > So he tightly grabbed his stick > and hit the driver a lick, > Then he raised a little shanty on his eye. But two policemen saw the muss, > And they soon joined in the fuss, > Then they ran McGinty in for being drunk; > And the Judge says with a smile, > We will keep you for a while, > In a cell to sleep upon a prison bunk.

It shares the same name as the Jamaican genre that influenced both it and dubstep, which originally derived from dub, reggae, and dancehall. Originating in the United Kingdom in the early 2010s as a resurgence of the style used by early dubstep works, riddim had started to gain mainstream presence in the electronic music scene around 2015. Despite receiving criticism for its sometimes repetitive drops, it has grown in popularity due to various well-known electronic music DJs playing songs of the subgenre in their live sets as well as various well- known electronic music artists producing the genre. History =Origins and evolution= The term \\"riddim\\" is the Jamaican Patois pronunciation of the English word \\"rhythm\\", with the genre sharing a name with the genre it is primarily derived from. The derived genre originally stemmed from dub, reggae, and dancehall. Although the term was widely used by MCs since the early days of dancehall and garage music, it was later adopted by American dubstep producers and fans to describe what was originally referred to as \\"wonky dubstep\\". As a subgenre, riddim started to gain mainstream presence in the electronic music scene around 2015. The first such use of the term traces back to electronic music forum ClublandLV in 2012, where moderators created a separate subforum with the name to distinguish the sound from dubstep. In the subforum's first post written by moderator FrostByte, riddim is described as \\"that really bouncy, wonky, sometimes repetitive side of dubstep that you can't help but skank out to\\". As all riddim works of music are dubstep, their histories and notable artists can be considered closely intertwined. Riddim can be traced back to several dubstep artists, including Jakes and Rusko. Although not considered a riddim artist, Rusko originally produced dubstep that featured riddim-esque bassline patterns. Jakes is credited by many as being the first riddim artist, and served as direct inspiration for the following wave of producers. From that wave, artists like Subfiltronik are credited for establishing what riddim is known as today. Various other artists have been credited for having contributed to the rise of the subgenre, including Bukez Finezt, Coffi, and Kromestar. =Growth= In January 2018, German DJ and producer Virtual Riot released his riddim-focused extended play German Engineering, which peaked at the No. 11 spot on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Album Sales chart. In February 2019, American multi-platinum artist Marshmello collaborated with riddim producer Svdden Death to release the song \\"Sell Out\\". Although the song was criticised for being an \\"easy cop- out to increase variety\\" within Marshmello's discography, the song charted on Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs at the No. 36 position. Svdden Death's later released extended play Voyd: 1.5 debuted at the No. 8 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums. Characteristics Rhythmically the style utilises repetitive, minimalistic layers and triplet percussion arrangements. Like dubstep, riddim is often produced at a tempo of 140 to 150 beats per minute and was noted as having comparatively more \\"space\\", atmosphere, and \\"super dark textures\\" by riddim producer Infekt. Jayce Ullah-Blocks of EDM Identity characterised modern riddim with the presence of low-frequency oscillation (LFO) sawtooth waves, wide delays, and a large use of flanger and chorus filters.

More recently, he's been working on the use of multi-potent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine for the treatment of neurological, systemic and orthopedic disorders.

He served as the doctor of the Frogman Unit in the Israeli Navy until 1970. He was trained at the Department of Internal Medicine of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem between 1970 and 1975. In 1975-1978 Shimon Slavin trained in clinical immunology/rheumatology at the Division of Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine and later on in 1978 trained in clinical bone marrow transplantation under the late Prof. E.D.

These observations that confirmed the therapeutic benefits of cell therapy lead to development of new concepts for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors focusing on utilizing well-tolerated non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation as a platform for cell therapy of cancer targeting killer cells against chemotherapy-resistant malignant cells. Using procedures developed by Slavin and his team, treatment of cancer is based on smart rather than aggressive treatment with conventional chemotherapy, which is associated with immediate and late procedure-related toxicity and mortality, aiming at selective elimination of all malignant cells including cancer stem cells.

First successful treatment for 'bubble babies'. As a rule, treatment of cancer focuses on a two-step approach: tumor debulking by conventional and innovative modalities, followed by immunotherapy of minimal residual disease. As such, innovative reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) or non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) were pioneered by Slavin for safer stem cell transplantation for treatment of malignant and life-threatening non-malignant disorders correctable by using stem cells and post-transplant immunotherapy if indicated for all patients in need. The use of RIC or NST made it possible to apply much safer curative stem cell transplantation for every patient in need with no lower or upper age restriction, including also patients with less than optimal clinical condition that would not be eligible for the standard myeloablative stem cell transplantation.Slavin S, Napier A, Naparstek E, Kapelushnik J et al., Non myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic stem cell transplantation: the future treatment of choice of hematologic malignancies and genetic diseases, ResearchGate Baxter International recognized the potential of cell therapy and signed an agreement which resulted in major investment with Slavin at Hadassah Medical Center for further development of new approaches based on cell therapy for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation based on new approaches for regulation rather than non-specific suppression of the immune system. Accordingly, Slavin's research center was established by Baxter International based in Chicago, USA and also supported by the Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Center.Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Laboratory, Hadassah Medical Center Slavin was founder and director of this research center in 1994‚Äì2007. Slavin with his team using a vector provided by the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan pioneered the first successful use of gene therapy for treatment of bubble baby born with adenosine deaminase deficiency in 2002 and the treated infant has since then been off any treatment with no evidence of disease for more than 16 years. The same procedure was used by the team in Milan for successful treatment of many additional patients and all were cured by successful gene therapy. More recently, Slavin introduced the use of personalized anti-cancer immunotherapy focusing on the use of activated donor lymphocytes targeted against cancer with monoclonal and bispecific antibodies for efficient elimination of cancer in parallel with induction of long-lasting anti-cancer immunity for prevention of recurrent disease. The use of innovative cell-mediated immunotherapy is now applied in other centers for treatment of otherwise resistant cancer, such as in patients with triple negative breast cancer.Triple Negative Breast Cancer: a Highly Significant Finding, MossReports In parallel with the growing activities of Slavin's center and his international impact in cell therapy, new approaches were developed for induction of transplantation tolerance of host-vs-graft and graft-vs-host towards developing improved methods for allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation as well as transplantation of cellular and perfused organ allografts. Initially, Slavin pioneered the use of monoclonal antibodies anti-CD52 (Alemtuzumab, now approved by FDA as Lemtrada) for prevention of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), the most serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and later on for treatment of CLL and multiple sclerosis.FDA Approves Lemtrada‚Ñ¢ (alemtuzumab) for Relapsing MS - UPDATE, National Multiple Sclerosis Society Later, Slavin introduced the concept of post-transplant depletion of host-vs-graft and graft-vs-host reactive lymphocytes with induction of bilateral transplantation tolerance. These discoveries made it possible to extend the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation using haploidentical donors instead of fully matched donors for safer allogeneic stem cell transplantation for every patient in need with hematological malignancies and solid tumors as well as for induction of transplantation tolerance to organ allografts. In parallel, Slavin introduced new approaches for treatment of life-threatening autoimmune diseases based on either autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or more recently using multi-potent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for regulation of the inflammatory anti-self reactivity in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders focusing on multiple sclerosis. Based on the cumulative experience using cell therapy, in recent years Slavin and his team focused also on using multi-potential bone marrow, adipose tissue or placenta & cord tissue derived MSCs for regenerative medicine, pioneering the use of MSCs for treatment of orthopedic indications including cartilage repair and new bone formation as well as for repair of renal function in addition to continuous treatment of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic neurological disorders.  Current work  In 2007, Slavin established a new center of excellence in Tel Aviv, the International Center for Cell Therapy & Cancer immunotherapy (CTCI). This center was devoted to develop and apply innovative approaches for treatment of cancer and life-threatening non-malignant disorders, including the use of stem cells for regenerative medicine focusing on the use of proprietary technologies for using bone marrow, cord/placenta and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for treatment of neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, treatment of renal failure and diabetes mellitus, repair of cartilage and regeneration of bone. At present, Slavin operates his new clinic, Biotherapy International, The Center for Innovative Cancer Biotherapy & Regenerative Medicine in Tel Aviv. Slavin's current activities focuses on improving the therapeutic effects of cell- mediated strategies based on the use of activated effector cells of the immune system, both T cells and especially NK cells for immunotherapy of cancer aiming for cure by elimination of all existing cancer cells at an early stage of minimal residual disease, in parallel with induction of long-lasting anti- cancer immunity against residual or re-emerging malignant cells. In parallel, using multi-potent stem cells focusing also on their secretory products, exosomes and extracellular vesicles, enriched with microRNA and other essential components for regenerative and anti-aging medicine.  Scientific contributions  Slavin's basic research and clinically applied discoveries were represented in over 600 published articles and more than 900 national and international scientific presentations resulted in international impact in several different disciplines mostly related to cellular therapy for treatment of malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Immunotherapy of cancer by donor lymphocytes made it possible to treat otherwise resistant hematological malignancies and certain metastatic solid tumors in patients with multidrug resistant cancer. The unique efficacy of intentionally mismatched donor lymphocytes using killer cells activated prior to and following cell infusion was translated into a new paradigm for cellular therapy of cancer based on the use of transient circulation of non-engrafting donor lymphocytes targeted against minimal residual disease as a new approach for potential cure of cancer at an early stage of the disease. Introducing NST and RIC made it possible to provide curative stem cell transplantation for a large number of patients in need with no lower or upper age group including patient's in poor performance status but would not be otherwise candidates for conventional myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Using NST and RIC provided a safe approach for transplantation of patient's particularly sensitive to conventional cytoreductive conditioning including older patients, patients with Fanconi's anemia and chronic granulomatous disease. Later on, introducing the concept of post-transplant deletion of alloreactive lymphocytes by cyclophosphamide by Slavin's team made it possible to provide a relatively safe and non-expensive transplant procedure for patients with no matched donor available using haploidentical family member. The same principle was applied by Slavin for successful induction of transplantation tolerance to organ allografts pioneered successfully for the first recipient of kidney allograft alive and well >10 years out. Observations by Slavin's team indicating that re-induction of self-tolerance could be induced by lymphoablative treatment followed by autologous stem cell transplantation provided the rationale for use of a similar approach for successful treatment of patients with life- threatening autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In 1977 Slavin discovered the first animal model of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL1) which provided an opportunity to better understand the biology of B cells and to develop new therapeutic strategies based on the preclinical animal model. Together with Dr. Herman Waldmann, Slavin was the first to introduce the use of an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (CAMPATH-1; Alemtuzumab and currently Lemtrada) that was initially used by Slavin for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and subsequently by others for prevention and treatment of allograft rejection and subsequently approved by FDA for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Slavin's initial success applying bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for treatment of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders together with Professor Karussis provided the rationale for using in vitro differentiated MSCs and possibly for future application of secretory products of MSCs, extracellular vesicles and exosomes.

The yard was opened in 1963 and replaced several smaller yards in the area. It was part of the British Transport Commission's Modernisation plan, and so was equipped with a hump to enable the efficient shunting and re-ordering of goods wagons. The yard lost its main reason for existing through the 1970s and 1980s when more trains on the British Rail system became block trains where their wagons required less, or more commonly, no shunting. Facilities at the site were progressively run down until it closed completely in 2012. History Construction on the yard started in 1959 and was completed four years later. Permission was sought from the National Coal Board to build the yard as it was built upon a profitable coal seam. The last coal was worked out in 1961 and stabilisation works were undertaken to enable the yard to be constructed. It was officially opened to traffic on 23 July 1963 by Lord Robens, who was chairman of the National Coal Board at the time. The yard had been conceived in the mid-1950s as part of the British Transport Commission's Modernisation Plan, which sought to rejuvenate the railways. Healey Mills was one of many hump yards being built, for whose traffic was planned in the 1950s, but by the time they were commissioned, lorries and fast motorways were eating into their ability to operate cost- effectively. Well into the 1970s, the traffic at Healey Mills was in excess of the 4,000 wagons per week that it was designed for; in one study week in 1966, over 16,500 wagons were sorted in the yard. Its location on an east/west axis meant that it was ideally positioned for the coal trains destined for either Lancashire, or the east coast ports of Hull, Immingham and Goole. The new yard cost ¬£3.75 million in 1963 (equivalent to ¬£55 million in 2013), covered over and stretched for alongside the railway and the River Calder. During construction, the site was flooded by the River Calder. In case of a re- occurrence of flooding, the control tower was built at above rail level. The yard was placed in the Healey Mills area near Ossett, and was located between the running lines of the existing Calder Valley railway. This involved the engineers having to widen the running lines in a bow formation and diverting the course of the River Calder. Four new bridges were built across the Calder and the relocation of the Osset Sewage Works was necessary before the main construction could start. The hump was installed at the west end of the yard so that traffic from the Yorkshire pits could be marshalled via a reversal over it, and then staged for delivery to either the east coast ports or Lancashire. It contained 120 sidings (covering of track), fourteen reception sidings over a semi-automated hump that led to 50 sorting sidings, and then a secondary yard with 25 sidings. The yard also had thirteen departure roads as well as fifteen staging sidings for block (trainload freight) trains. Healey Mills, which was situated between and replaced several smaller yards in the Dewsbury/Wakefield area (namely Brighouse, Crofton Laden, Horbury Junction Sidings, Low Moor, Mirfield, Mytholmroyd, New Withams, Turners Lane and Wakefield Exchange). Three other yards, Copley Hill, Crofton Empty and Hillhouse, worked in a smaller capacity than before as some of their traffic was transferred to Healey Mills. When British Rail launched Speedlink (their air-braked wagonload network) in 1975, Healey Mills was one of twelve yards across the network where traffic could be swapped and interchanged. However, Speedlink was withdrawn from Healey Mills just ten years later in 1985. Whilst a disused chord at Horbury to the east was used to stable the Royal Train on several occasions, in 1977, the Queen slept in the yard when the Royal Train was berthed overnight in the sidings. In March 1982, a slow speed incident caused the derailment of some wagons on a freight train, one of which was a nuclear flask wagon. Questions were put to the Secretary of State for Transport, but as the derailment was at very low speed and no injuries occurred, there was no official post-accident investigation. The hump was closed in 1984 when average loads over it were 100 wagons per day, well below the 4,000 it was designed for. Much of the coal traffic that went through, or passed by the yard, was marshalled into merry-go-round (MGR) trains and so did not need shunting or marshalling. Coupled with this, the closure of Yorkshire coal mines in the 1980s meant that the traffic through the yard had dwindled. By 1985, the yard could not be accessed directly from the west; the hump and reception sidings were closed and lifted. Traffic arriving from the Calder Valley or Standedge lines, would need to reverse in the departure sidings on the east end side of the yard. The sidings on the southern side of the yard were still important for re-staffing of locomotives, though by this time, the throughput at Healey Mills was as low as 18 trains per week due to a drastic cutback in coal operations. Wagonload traffic still called, and was marshalled at Healey Mills, throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, with it finally ceasing in 1985. However, it saw a small resurgence when the pre-privatised freight companies launched a wagonload service in the early 1990s. It lost its marshalling responsibilities again in May 1998, when Doncaster Belmont yard superseded Healey Mills as the gathering point and hub for Yorkshire. Doncaster Belmont's position on the East Coast Main Line meant that it was geographically and strategically better placed to handle the wagonload traffic (now branded as Enterprise under EWS ownership). The signing on point for traincrew was closed in February 2012 when it was transferred to some portacabins near to Wakefield Kirkgate railway station. The depot buildings were demolished in 2016 and most of the track has been removed. In February 2017, redundant carriages and track were used in a crash exercise using railway staff and the emergency services. The site at Healey Mills was under consideration as a Rolling Stock Depot (RSD) for HS2 trains in the Yorkshire area; the proposed depot has been outlined at Gateway 45 in Leeds, however. Depot A depot was not built at the yard to accommodate steam trains, but in June 1966, one was built for diesel locomotives. It was the first built by the Eastern Region of British Rail that was not associated with, or had replaced, an existing steam shed, although it was coded 56B under Wakefield Shed. Steam trains had previously been supplied by Wakefield Shed (56A), which then closed in 1967. The last steam trains on British Rail were operating from Rose Grove depot in Lancashire in August 1968. This brought a daily steam locomotive hauled train from Rose Grove to Healey Mills. Diesel shunters operating in the yard before the diesel depot was built, had to run to Hammerton Street depot in Bradford for servicing. Allocation of locomotives at Healey Mills numbered around 70 throughout the 1970s, but had risen slightly to 77 by 1982. This was composed of classes 03, 08, 37, 40, 47 and class 56, though the class 56 locomotives were only allocated to the depot for two years. Under TOPS, the depot code was HM. Due to the loss of traffic and the closure of the hump yard, the depot was downgraded from a Traction Maintenance Depot (TMD) into a traction servicing depot. It lost its allocation of mainline locomotives, which were shared between Gateshead, Immingham, March, Stratford, Tinsley and Thornaby, and its shunters were sent to Leeds Holbeck. In 1993, Trainload Petroleum reopened the depot at Healey Mills, though this was short-lived, and was only used for fuelling and minor maintenance of locomotives.

He was a leading figure in ichthyology in Texas, teaching many students who went on to be renowned in the field, was actively involved in many ichthyological societies and was an editor of scientific journals. Hubbs was also an environmental activist, fighting to conserve freshwater ecosystems. Early life Clark Hubbs was born on March 15, 1921 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His father was the ichthyologist Carl L. Hubbs and his mother was Laura C. Hubbs. The Hubbs family undertook trips to Arkansas, Florida, and the Great Basin where they collected zoological specimens. He had a brother and two sisters. His brother, Earl, became a biology teacher and his sister, Frances, married the ichthyologist Robert Rush Miller. His other sister, Margaret, died in childhood. Their father set up a system of \\"allowances\\" for each of the children based on their success at collecting specimens; 5 cents for each species with an additional $1 if it was thought to be a taxon new to science, and $5 if it proved to be a new genus, with the last new genera being found in Nevada in 1934 and 1938. Education and the army Hubbs gained a post as a field technician with the Michigan Institute for Fisheries Research in 1939 before attending the University of Michigan where he obtained a degree in Zoology in 1942. He remained in Ann Arbor during this time. In the summer after he graduated he worked in Massachusetts surveying streams before he was conscripted into the United States Army. In the Army he served with the 96th Infantry Division in the Intelligence Section of its headquarters. The 96th was in action at Leyte and at Okinawa. Hubbs was honorably discharged from the Army in January 1946. Although he escaped being injured in combat he was, however, severely injured by being nipped in the thigh by a blue crab, the resulting injury prevented him from working for six months although he was denied any financial aid by the Workers' Compensation officials. Following his discharge he enrolled at the University of California Los Angeles, the Hopkins Marine Station, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Leland Stanford Jr. University. He received his Ph.D. from the latter institution in 1952 and he worked as an acting instructor at the Hopkins Marine Station in the summer of 1948. He joined the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists as life member in 1940. University of Texas Hubbs was appointed as an instructor in zoology at the University of Texas in 1949, he was promoted to assistant professor in 1952, associate professor in 1957, he became the Chairman of the Division of Biological Sciences in 1974 and the Chairman of Zoology in 1978. In 1988 he was appointed the Clark Hubbs Regents Professor in Zoology and in 1991 gained emeritus status. In all, he spent 59 years working at the University of Texas and the university awarded him its Lifetime Service award. He was also a visiting professor of zoology at the University of Oklahoma and at Texas A&M; University. During his career he published over 300 papers and articles and he continued working in the field up to a month before his death. His published literature is mainly in fishes, but he published some work on amphibians and even an article on the fruit fly, Drosophila, albeit as fish food. He also trained over forty masters and doctorate students in his time at the University of Texas, including Victor G. Springer and Kirk Winemiller. Hubbs deposited the material he collected throughout his life at the Ichthyology Division of the Texas Natural History Collections of the Texas Memorial Museum at The University of Texas at Austin. Other activities He served as the president of the following organizations, Southwestern Association of Naturalists from 1966 to 1967, the Texas Academy of Sciences from 1972 to 1973, the Texas Organization for Endangered Species from 1978 to 1979, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists in 1987 and the American Institute of Fisheries Research Biologists from 1995-1997. He also spent four years as editor for the Texas Journal of Science. He went on to edit the Southwestern Naturalist and the Transactions of the American Fisheries Society. He was the editor of America's primary ichthyological and herpetological journal Copeia for fourteen years. Hubbs had at least three species of fish named in his honor: Lepidonectes clarkhubbsi, Menidia clarkhubbsi, and Gambusia clarkhubbsi. He was an active environmentalist and fought to protect freshwater ecosystems, appearing as a witness in many court cases affecting water supply, canals and dams, for example he was an expert witness in the lawsuit over the Edwards Aquifer which saw the establishment of the Edwards Aquifer Authority to ensure that the spring flows were enough to conserve the habitat of the endangered fishes, the San Marcos gambusia and the fountain darter. His activities as an environmental activist saw him receive a number of awards and he served on the board of the Nature Conservancy, among other organizations. He also worked on the Texas Utilities Environmental Steering Committee, Rio Grande Fishes Recovery Team, Hubbs Sea World Research Institute, the University of Texas Marine Sciences Institute, and the southwestern division of the Environmental Defense Fund. Hubbs started to publish a checklist, The Fishes of Texas, during the 1960s and in the 1980s colleagues and students associated with Hubbs began to add additional information about each fish species. Hubbs wanted to turn this into a book and he labored on this project, collaborating with others until his death. However, they realized that an electronic format would reach more people and so The Fishes of Texas Online project began. Personal life Hubbs met Catherine V. Symons on a field trip with the Stanford University Natural History Club and married her in 1949. His parents had met in a similar fashion. They had three children: Laura (born 1950), John (born 1952) and Anne (born 1955). Hubbs was known for his collection of clothing depicting fish. Hubbs died from cancer in Austin on February 3, 2008.

The annual rings are oriented incorrectly, which gives the wood a fiery appearance. The variant originally comes from Karelia in Finland and Russia. The curliness is passed on in up to 70 % of all trees in the next generation. Common spring birch is also sometimes referred to as masonry birch, but one should only use that term for trees that have the real curliness.  The wood  The annual rings are wavelike and irregular, with brown curly-grained wood tissue cells often exhibit a V pattern in the cross- sectional view. If this pattern continues evenly across the entire surface, the result is a starlike pattern (a.k.a. curly-grain blossom). The longitudinal section of the stem exhibits lenslike patterns. The wood of curly birch is dense and very heavy, when freshly felled it can rise to 930 kg/m¬≥, and at 12% moisture approx. 700-730 kg/m¬≥. Curly birch exhibits some exceptional leaf forms, but these cannot be used as certain identifiers. The irregular bud formation connected to curly-grainedness results in abundant branching and bushy habit among curly birches. Curly birch wood is used for furniture, knife shafts, and in woodturning for bowls and pens.  Distribution  The curly birch is found naturally only in Europe and only in small separate areas. In Finland, it occurs naturally in Southern Finland up to the latitude of Jyv√§skyl√§, and especially in former swidden areas. In the other Nordic countries, curly birch occurs in parts of southern Sweden and in the most south-easterly parts of Norway. In addition to the above, curly birch is to be found in the Russia (Karelia, Ingria, and some other western areas), in the Baltic countries, and in Belarus. There also are scattered stands of curly birch in Central Europe. However, curly birch is most abundant in Finland and in the Karelia region of Russia.  References   External links  *Visaseura r.y.

He was a vice presidential candidate in the 1999 presidential vote and the 2004 presidential election. Early life Siswono was born in Long Iram in West Kutai Regency on 4 July 1943, during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. He was of Javanese ancestry. The third child of ten, his father was a doctor who was assigned in Kalimantan. As a child, he followed his father's change of assignment, moving to Tenggarong and later Palu, where he attended kindergarten. By 1949, his family moved to Kendal where he attended elementary school. On 1958, he moved to Jakarta to attend high school, and by 1961 he enrolled at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). During his time studying at ITB, Siswono was part of GMNI (Gerakan Mahasiswa Nasional Indonesia, Indonesian National Students' Movement) and Barisan Soekarno - an organization that supported Sukarno, which was censured when Suharto took power. As a result, he was suspended from his studies for four years. During this time, he engaged in trading produce, namely selling garlic from East Java to Jakarta and Palembang. He was allowed to return to his studies in 1968. Career After graduating, Siswono started a construction firm PT Bangun Cipta Sarana along with his friends from ITB in 1969. The firm benefited from a construction boom during the Suharto period, and was given the contracts to build the graves of Sukarno and Hatta. Siswono eventually accepted an offer to become the Minister of Public Housing under Suharto's cabinet in 1988, and was reappointed as the Minister of Transmigration and Manpower in 1993. Following the fall of Suharto, Siswono was the Chairman of the Indonesian Farmers Association, and he represented the \\"Business Group\\" in the People's Consultative Assembly between 1999 and 2004. He was considered as a likely Vice Presidential candidate in the 1999 vote, but won the fewest votes out of the five candidates (31 out of 613) and was dropped in the first round of voting. During this time, he was a member of Golkar. For the 2004 presidential election, Siswono became the running mate to Amien Rais. Six political parties supported them, but the pair was eliminated in the first round of voting after only winning 14.66 percent of votes, placing them fourth. Later in the 2009 legislative election, Siswono was elected to the People's Representative Council representing Central Java's 1st electoral district still as a Golkar candidate. He was part of the body's fourth commission and was deputy chairman of its honor council. He did not run for reelection in 2014, citing his age. By 2017, he had joined the Nasdem Party and became the chairman of its advisory council. He had also been the chairman of Pancasila University's foundation.

Bramston was the eldest surviving son of Antony Bramston of Skreens and his wife Catherine Nutt, daughter. of Sir Thomas Nutt of Mays, Sussex. and the grandson of Sir John Bramston, former MP for Essex and Maldon. He was admitted at Middle Temple in 1707 and at Pembroke College, Cambridge on 11 October 1707. In 1714 he was called to the bar. On succeeding his father to Skreens in 1722, he also became High steward of Maldon.. He married Diana Ferne widow of Robert Ferne of Locke, Derbyshire and daughter of Edward Turner of Stoke, Lincolnshire. Diana died on 10 January 1726 and he married as his second wife Elizabeth Berney, daughter of Richard Berney, recorder of Norwich, in January 1733 At the 1727 British general election, Bramston was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Maldon replacing Thomas Bramston of Writtle with whom his political career has sometimes been conflated. Bramston made his first recorded speech opposing the Address on 7 May 1728 and again opposed the Address on 21 January 1729. On 26 January 1730, he seconded a motion calling for information as to any engagements entered into for the hire of foreign troops. On 11 March 1730, he moved for ‚Äòan address to the King for a particular account of the ¬£60,000 granted last year for to make good the engagements with foreign princes‚Äô, but Walpole avoided the question through parliamentary procedure. Also in 1730 he carried a bill which resulted in the release of about 10,000 insolvent debtors. He supported a place bill on 17 February 1731. In 1732 Bramston was responsible for an Act requiring a land qualification for Justices of the Peace, after complaints that several JPs had no fortunes, and some were not able to write or read.

Early life and education  Holly earned her BS in Civil Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in 1998 and her Ph.D. in Hydrology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005. Michael performed her graduate research at MIT on seasonal groundwater exchange in coastal zones in Massachusetts with her Ph.D. advisor Charles F. Harvey.  Career and research  Holly Michael is an Associate Professor of geology at the University of Delaware. Her research focuses on coastal hydrogeology, groundwater-surface water interactions, and water resource management, and is often aimed at better understanding how groundwater flows and solute levels affect ecosystem and human health. Prior to serving as an associate professor at the University of Delaware in 2008, Michael performed research at Stanford University and with the US Geologic Survey. Michael's academic work has had a significant impact on the discipline of hydrogeology. Her research on groundwater contamination by arsenic in the Bengal Basin has implications for the 70 million people who rely on the Bengal Basin for drinking water. Additionally, her work investigating the impacts of climate change on coastal aquifers in Bangladesh is relevant to the 40 million people who rely on those coastal ecosystems to live and work. Michael has also performed research on strategies to effectively manage and store monsoonal flow in the Ganges Basin, which has implications for flood management and water security. Her work has been published by a number of notable publications including Nature and Science. She currently leads the hydrogeology group in the department of Geologic Sciences at the University of Delaware. In 2012, Holly Michael received the highly prestigious National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Award.

Early life and career  She was born Frances Lee Wismer in Pana, Illinois, to George Wismer, a German immigrant, and his wife Emma. In 1908, after her father won 80 acres of homestead land in a lottery, the Wismer family moved to Spokane, Washington, and opened a lunchroom. Her father died in a car accident in 1915, when Frances was nine years old. Her mother later remarried and moved the family to Mabton, Washington. Frances graduated from high school in 1924. She worked her way through the University of Washington, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1935. During her more than ten years as a part-time student, she taught private art classes, worked as a substitute art teacher at the university, sold handmade jewelry, illustrated children's books, and designed graphic art for area businesses. In 1929 she exhibited a set of linoleum block prints at the first annual exhibition of the Northwest Printmakers and won the Purchase Prize for her print, High Water at Moore's Point, Chelan. The following year she collaborated with Seattle artist Grace Perry to publish Twelve Block Prints of Lake Chelan. Illustration from a propaganda leaflet designed by Frances Blakemore, 1940s. While her fellow art students dreamed of living in Paris, she was fascinated with Japan. Soon after graduating from college, she married Glenn Frederic Baker, a graduate student, and moved with him to Tokyo, where they taught art and English at Hosei University, Keio University, and Waseda High School. She also earned money by drawing weekly sketches for Japan News Week and painting murals. She continued making block prints and exhibiting with the Northwest Printmakers. In 1940 she left Japan to avoid being arrested and interned, and spent World War II living in Honolulu, where she worked for the Office of War Information designing airborne leaflet propaganda for distribution in Japan.  Life in Japan  She returned to Tokyo in 1946 and went to work for the Civil Information and Education (CI&E;) Division of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) during the occupation of Japan, designing brochures and posters to promote the reconstruction project. In 1949, she wrote and illustrated Jeeper's Japan, a book of humorous rhyming couplets about life in occupied Japan. After the occupation she worked as director of exhibits for the American embassy in Tokyo. In 1952, she collaborated with Oliver Statler on an exhibition called Modern Prints, which toured the United States and introduced many Americans to the Japanese s≈çsaku-hanga (creative print) movement. Around this time she switched from block printing to screen printing and the occasional collagraph or etching. In 1954 she married Thomas Blakemore, an American-born corporate lawyer. She and her husband founded the Franell Gallery (1965-1984), located in the Hotel Okura Tokyo. The gallery focused on the work of modern Japanese printmakers including Yoshitoshi Mori and Tadashi Nakayama. She continued to make her own screen prints and abstract paintings, and made her first solo exhibition at the International House of Japan in 1960. She also collected Japanese textiles and stencils, which were exhibited throughout the United States and Australia. In the 1970s, she published two books on Japanese design, both of which were reprinted four times. In the Japan Times, Donald Richie wrote in 2008, \\"Blakemore's style was modernist in that it derived from Cezanne...and the mild cubism seen in another influence, Diego Rivera. This was much molded, however, by what she had seen and studied in Japan, and the Mingei (folk crafts) theories of her friends Soetsu Yanagi and Shoji Hamada. In particular, the early and decorative cubist interest was transformed by Blakemore's enthusiasm for katagami, Japanese hand-cut stencils.\\"  Later years and death  In the 1980s, the Blakemores retired to Seattle, where they spent the rest of their lives. In 1990, they co-founded the Blakemore Foundation, which grants scholarships for the study of East and Southeast Asian languages to American citizens and permanent residents. Following her husband's death in 1994, Blakemore donated her art collection, which included her own art as well as hundreds of Japanese prints and textiles, to the Seattle Art Museum, the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, and the Henry Art Gallery. Frances Blakemore died on August 1, 1997, aged 91. A biography of Blakemore was published in 2007 by the Blakemore Foundation and the University of Washington. In 2011, Blakemore and her war propaganda leaflets were featured in an episode of the PBS series, History Detectives.

It is owned by MindGeek. History In August 2018, the MindGeek subsidiary Men.com released its first scene featuring MMF bisexual porn titled \\"The Challenge\\", which created controversy over whether bisexual porn belonged on a gay porn website. Men.com stated that they decided to feature bisexual content because \\"After asking our users what they would like to see, a surprisingly large number asked for a fully bisexual scene.\\" Following a backlash over the scene, Men.com decided to no longer feature more bisexual content. Because the release of the bisexual scene \\"left many angry gay porn fans in complete shock\\", the MindGeek conglomerate decided to create a separate studio for bisexual porn called \\"WhyNotBi.com\\" and feature bisexual content on the WhyNotBi.com website instead of the Men.com website. WhyNotBi is MindGeek's first bisexual porn site. The website aims to be \\"uninhibited\\" and feature \\"taboo fantasies\\", with a representative claiming that \\"It doesn‚Äôt matter if you like studs with big dicks, blondes with big tits, young hunks, cute teens or all of the above ‚Äî WhyNotBi has something for everyone\\", including bisexual threesomes and orgies, spouse swapping, boyfriend sharing, and cuckoldry. WhyNotBi features exclusively bisexual content and is geared towards bisexual men. The scenes place the ‚Äúfocus on the men‚Äù and many scenes have featured the bisexual debuts of prominent pornographic actors generally known for acting in gay porn. Gay porn actors including Wesley Woods, Jackson Trainor, Thyle Knoxx, and Justin Matthews have made their first bisexual scenes on WhyNotBi. Reactions have been mixed, with the website receiving both praise and criticism. Bisexual men have expressed support for a studio geared towards them, while some gay men have objected by claiming that gay porn actors having sex with women is heteronormative. The website has been praised for its diversity for featuring gay, bisexual, heterosexual, and transgender content in its scenes. Awards WhyNotBi's film Free For All won \\"Best Bi Sex Scene\\" at the 2020 GayVN Awards.

In 1994 she became the first woman dean of the at the University of Buenos Aires. In 2004, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fondo Nacional de las Artes. Biography Carmen C√≥rdova belonged to an ideologically progressive family, the daughter of writer and Carmen de la Serna, sister of Che Guevara's mother, . She grew up surrounded by an intellectual and cultural world, which led her to love the arts and study several of them. She dedicated 14 years of her life to dance, studying at the National Conservatory. She wrote prose, painted, and dabbled in acting. While studying painting at Emilio Pettoruti's studio, she met her future OAM colleague, partner, and husband, the architect , with whom she had three daughters. She died in Buenos Aires in 2011. Career The (OAM) The (OAM) was founded at the behest of Tom√°s Maldonado and , and also included C√≥rdova and Baliero, Jorge Bullrich, Juan Manuel Borthagaray, Alicia Cazzaniga, Gerardo Clusellas, , Jorge Grisetti, and Eduardo Polledo. Besides being interested in architecture, members of the group were lovers of all the arts and their joint expression. They had their headquarters in a building on Cerrito Street in Buenos Aires, which was a cradle of the city's architectural modernity. Their work in the studio of Maldonado, Hlito and Carlos M√©ndez Mosquera would give rise to the publishing house Nueva Visi√≥n, fundamental in the translation of modern texts into Castilian. The sculptor Enio Iommi worked on another floor, and the young students , Ernesto Katzenstein, and Eduardo Bell worked in the attic. Together with Solsona and Katzenstein, C√≥rdova began teaching under professor . From this experience she learned to recognize the value of modern architecture and criticism of the movement itself, with Acosta's ideas regarding climate being fundamental. Belonging to OAM transformed Carmen C√≥rdova's way of understanding architecture, especially the texts of Le Corbusier and the aesthetic and architectural reference of Max Bill. This coincided with her work, together with Solsona and Katzenstein, drafting the Plan for the South District of the city of Buenos Aires, directed by Antoni Bonet. In those years she traveled to Brazil to present the Revista Nueva Visi√≥n, in the company of Horacio Baliero. They spent six months there, getting to know the most influential architecture of the day, especially that of Oscar Niemeyer, for whom she felt a great admiration. These influences are reflected in the contest the couple won in 1961 for the Mar del Plata cemetery. This included a wing for an Israeli cemetery, which was transformed into a chapel following the military coup in 1966. Like many OAM members, C√≥rdova was a university professor, a post she left after the bloody action against students by the dictatorship in 1966, known as \\"La Noche de los Bastones Largos\\" (The Night of the Long Batons). C√≥rdova and Baliero won the competition to design the Colegio Mayor Universitario Hispano Argentino Nuestra Se√±ora de Luj√°n in Madrid, which led them to move there with their three daughters in 1966. They partnered with to complete the work, which was modified in its materiality according to the climate and local technological capabilities. In 2004 the Government of Spain declared it to be a heritage building. In 1986 she was elected academic secretary to dean Juan Manuel Borthagaray at the of the University of Buenos Aires (FADU-UBA) for two terms, after which she herself was elected dean. During her term the organization of the house of studies was completely changed. Graphic Design and Industrial Design programs were created, based on electives that were dictated in architecture. In 1989 the programs Clothing and Textile Design, Landscape Design, and were added to the Faculty's offerings, the latter as a result of work shared with the architect Graciela Raponi and C√≥rdova's passion for cinema. After almost 30 years, despite the resistance of more conservative and elitist academics and professionals, the creation of these programs proved to be a success that reflected the variety of students' interests. In 1994 she was elected dean of the FADU unanimously, but despite that support she was unable to achieve her dream of an academic program that was closer to the ideals of the Bauhaus that she admired so much. It was a disappointing experience in political terms, causing her to resign along with her vice-dean in 1996, and led her not to want to be involved in any project or public activity in the last years of her life. In 2001 Carmen C√≥rdova wrote the book Memorias de modernidad (Memoirs of Modernity) as a rebellious response to an unjust world that did not satisfy her and with which she totally disagreed.

The game was a computer moderated, closed-end game with the goal to retrieve treasures from castles in a medieval setting. The game received generally positive reviews in periodicals of the period, with specific mentions of its combat, maps, and low error rates on turn sheets. Gameplay LandLords was a computer moderated play-by-mail game in which players in a barbaric land compete to find the three treasures among the 30 castles located in the land. The goal of the game was to be the first player to return three treasures to your fortress. In 1985, the game had six maps available for players to choose from: Africa, Appalaccia, England, Europe, the Holy Land, and North America. Maps were updated every turn to aid players in planning their gameplay. At the outset of the game, players had two computer-generated \\"tactical maps\\" with villages, castles, towers, and country locations to help plan the fortunes of the single country at their disposal. Players needed to manage a number of possessions and variables such as caravans, fortresses, and peasants to affect outputs such as gold income and food available. Advancing further into the game introduced additional elements, such as combat involving caravans and villages, as well as dragons which had \\"artifacts\\" that could aid players.

One of the impacts of such technology is that hyper-realistic videos and photos makes it difficult for the human eye to distinguish what is real and what is fake. Furthermore, with various companies making such technologies available to the public, they can bring various benefits as well as potential legal and ethical concerns. Digital cloning first became popular in the entertainment industry. The idea of digital clones originated from movie companies creating virtual actors of actors who have died. When actors pass away during a movie production, a digital clone of the actor can be synthesized using past footage, photos, and voice recordings to mimic the real person in order to continue the movie production. Modern artificial intelligence, has allowed for the creation of deepfakes. This involves manipulation of a video to the point where the person depicted in the video is saying or performing actions he or she may not have consented to. In April 2018, BuzzFeed released a deepfake video of Jordan Peele, which was manipulated to depict former President, Barack Obama, making statements he has previously not made in public to warn the public against the potential dangers of deepfakes. In addition to deepfakes, companies such as Intellitar now allows one to easily create a digital clone of themselves by feeding a series of images and voice recordings. This essentially creates digital immortality, allowing loved ones to interact with those who died. Digital cloning not only allows one to digitally memorialize their loved ones, but they can also be used to create avatars of historical figures and be used in an educational setting. With the development of various technology, as mentioned above, there are numerous concerns that arises, including identity theft, data breaches, and other ethical concerns. One of the issues with digital cloning is that there are little to no legislations to protect potential victims against these possible problems.  Technology  = Intelligent Avatar Platforms (IAP) = Intelligent Avatar Platform (IAP) can be defined as an online platform supported by artificial intelligence that allows one to create a clone of themselves. The individual must train his or her clone to act and speak like themselves by feeding the algorithm numerous voice recordings and videos of themselves. Essentially, this platform becomes a place where one lives eternally, as they are able to interact with other avatars on the same platform. IAP is becoming a platform for one to attain digital immortality, along with maintaining a family tree and legacy for generations following to see. Some examples of IAP include Intellitar and Eterni.me. Although most of these companies are still in its developing stages, they all are trying to achieve the same goal of allowing the user to create an exact duplicate of themselves to store every memory they have in their mind into the cyberspace. Some include a free version, which only allows the user to choose their avatar from a given set of images and audio. However, with the premium setting, these companies will ask the user to upload photos, videos, and audio recordings of one to form a realistic version of themselves. Additionally, to ensure that the clone is as close to the original person, companies also encourage interacting with their own clone by chatting and answering questions for them. This allows the algorithm to learn the cognition of the original person and apply that to the clone. Intellitar closed down in 2012 because of intellectual property battles over the technology it usedhttp://fusion.net/story/116999/this-start-up-promised-10000-people- eternal-digital-life-then-it-died/ Potential concerns with IAP includes the potential data breaches and not getting consent of the deceased. IAP must have a strong foundation and responsibility against data breaches and hacking in order to protect personal information of the dead, which can include voice recording, photos, and messages. In addition to the risk of personal privacy being compromised, there is also the risk of violating the privacy of the deceased. Although one can give consent to creating a digital clone of themselves before his or her physical death, they are unable to give consent to the actions the digital clone may take. = Deepfakes = As described earlier, deepfakes is a form of video manipulation where one can change the people present by feeding various images of a specific person they want. Furthermore, one can also change the voice and words the person in the video says by simply submitting series of voice recordings of the new person lasting about one or two minutes long. In 2018, a new app called FakeApp was released, allowing the public to easily access this technology to create videos. This app was also used to create the Buzzfeed video of former President Barack Obama. With deepfakes, industries can cut the cost of hiring actors or models for films and advertisements by creating videos and film efficiently at a low cost just by collecting a series of photos and audio recordings with the consent of the individual. Potential concerns with deepfakes is that access is given to virtually anyone who downloads the different apps that offer the same service. With anyone being able to access this tool, some may maliciously use the app to create revenge porn and manipulative videos of public officials making statements they will never say in real life. This not only invades the privacy of the individual in the video but also brings up various ethical concerns. = Voice cloning = Voice cloning is a deep-learning algorithm that takes in voice recordings of an individual and is able to synthesize such a voice into one that is very similar to the original voice. Similar to deepfakes, there are numerous apps, such as LyreBird, iSpeech, and CereVoice Me, that gives the public access to such technology. The algorithm simply needs at most a couple of minutes of audio recordings in order to produce a voice that is similar and it will also take in any text and will read it out loud. Although this application is still in the developmental stage, it is rapidly developing as big technology corporations, such as Google and Amazon are investing huge amounts of money for the development. Some of the positive uses of voice cloning include the ability to synthesize millions of audiobooks without the use of human labor. Another include those who may have lost their voice can gain back a sense of individuality by creating their own voice clone by inputting recordings of them speaking before they lost their voices. On the other hand, voice cloning is also susceptible to misuse. An example of this is voices of celebrities and public officials being cloned and the voice may say something to provoke conflict despite the actual person has no association to what their voice said. In recognition of the threat that voice cloning poses to privacy, civility, and democratic processes, the Institutions including FTC, U.S. Department of Justice and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have weighed in on various deepfake audio use cases and methods that might be used to combat them.https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/29/ftc-voice- cloning-seminar-crime-use-cases-safeguards-ai-machine-learning/  Constructive uses  = Education = Digital cloning can be useful in an educational setting to create a more immersive experience for students. Some students may learn better through a more interactive experience and creating deepfakes can enhance the learning ability of students. One example of this includes creating a digital clone of historical figures, such as Abraham Lincoln, to show what problems he faced during his life and how he was able to overcome them. Another example of using digital clones in an educational setting is having speakers create a digital clone of themselves. Various advocacy groups may have trouble with schedules as they are touring various schools during the year. However, by creating digital clones of themselves, their clones can present the topic at places where the group could not physically make it. These educational benefits can bring students a new way of learning as well as giving access to those who previously were not able to access resources due to environmental conditions. = Arts = Although digital cloning has already been in the entertainment and arts industry for a while, artificial intelligence can greatly expand the uses of these technology in the industry. The movie-industry can create even more hyper-realistic actors and actresses who have passed away. Additionally, movie-industry can also create digital clones in movie scenes that may require extras, which can help cut the cost of production immensely. However, digital cloning and other technology can be beneficial for non-commercial purposes. For example, artists can be more expressive if they are looking to synthesize avatars to be part of their video production. They can also create digital avatars to draft up their work and help formulate their ideas before moving on working on the final work. = Digital immortality = Although digital immortality has existed for a while as social media accounts of the deceased continue to remain in cyberspace, creating a virtual clone that is immortal takes on a new meaning. With the creation of a digital clone, one can not only capture the visual presence of themselves but also their mannerism, including personality and cognition. With digital immortality, one can continue to interact with their loved ones after they pass away, which can possibly end the barrier of physical death. Furthermore, families can connect with multiple generations, forming a family tree, in a sense, to pass on the family legacy to future generations, providing a way for history to be passed down.  Concerns  = Fake news = With a lack of regulations for deepfakes, there are several concerns that arises. Some concerning deepfake videos that can bring potential harm includes depiction of political officials displaying inappropriate behavior, police officers shown as shooting unarmed black men, and soldiers murdering innocent civilians may begin to appear although it may have never occurred in real life. With such hyper-realistic videos being released on the Internet, it becomes very easy for the public to be misinformed, which could lead people to take actions, thus contributing to this vicious cycle of unnecessary harm. Additionally, with the rise in fake news in recent news, there is also the possibility of combining deepfakes and fake news. This will bring further difficulty to distinguishing what is real and what is fake. Visual information can be very convincing to the human eyes, therefore, the combination of deepfakes and fake news can have a detrimental effect on society. Strict regulations should be made by social media companies and other platforms for news. = Personal use = Another reason deepfakes can be used maliciously is for one to sabotage another on a personal level. With the increased accessibility of technologies to create deepfakes, blackmailers and thieves are able to easily extract personal information for financial gains and other reasons by creating videos of loved ones of the victim asking for help. Furthermore, voice cloning can be used maliciously for criminals to make fake phone calls to victims. The phone calls will have the exact voice and mannerism as the individual, which can trick the victim into giving private information to the criminal without knowing. Creating deepfakes and voice clones for personal use can be extremely difficult under the law because there is no commercial harm. Rather, they often come in the form of psychological and emotional damage, making it difficult for the court to provide a remedy for. = Ethical implications = Although there are numerous legal problems that arises with the development of such technology, there are also ethical problems that may not be protected under the current legislations. One of the biggest problems that comes with the use of deepfakes and voice cloning is the potential of identity theft. However, identity theft in terms of deepfakes are difficult to prosecute because there are currently no laws that are specific to deepfakes. Furthermore, the damages that malicious use of deepfakes can bring is more of a psychological and emotional one rather than a financial one, which makes it more difficult to provide a remedy for. Allen argues that the way one‚Äôs privacy should be treated is similar to Kant‚Äôs categorical imperative. Another ethical implication is the use of private and personal information one must give up to use the technology. Because digital cloning, deepfakes, and voice cloning all use a deep-learning algorithm, the more information the algorithm receives, the better the results are. However, every platform has a risk of data breach, which could potentially lead to very personal information being accessed by groups that users never consented to. Furthermore, post-mortem privacy comes into question when family members of a loved one tries to gather as much information as possible to create a digital clone of the deceased without the permission of how much information they are willing to give up.  Existing laws in the United States  = Copyright laws = In the United States, copyright laws require some type of originality and creativity in order to protect the author‚Äôs individuality. However, creating a digital clone simply means taking personal data, such as photos, voice recordings, and other information in order to create a virtual person that is as close to the actual person. In the decision of Supreme Court case Feist Publications Inc. v. Rural Television Services Company, Inc., Justice O‚ÄôConnor emphasized the importance of originality and some degree of creativity. However, the extent of originality and creativity is not clearly defined, creating a gray area for copyright laws. Creating digital clones require not only the data of the person but also the creator‚Äôs input of how the digital clone should act or move. In Meshwerks v. Toyota, this question was raised and the court stated that the same copyright laws created for photography should be applied to digital clones. = Right of publicity = With the current lack of legislations to protect individuals against potential malicious use of digital cloning, the right of publicity may be the best way to protect one in a legal setting. The right of publicity, also referred to as personality rights, gives autonomy to the individual when it comes to controlling their own voice, appearance, and other aspects that essentially makes up their personality in a commercial setting. If a deepfake video or digital clone of one arises without their consent, depicting the individual taking actions or making statements that are out of their personality, they can take legal actions by claiming that it is violating their right to publicity. Although the right to publicity specifically states that it is meant to protect the image of an individual in a commercial setting, which requires some type of profit, some state that the legislation may be updated to protect virtually anyone's image and personality. Another important note is that the right of publicity is only implemented in specific states, so some states may have different interpretations of the right compared to other states.  Preventative measures  = Technology = One way to prevent being a victim to any of the technology mentioned above is to develop artificial intelligence against these algorithms. There are already several companies that have developed artificial intelligence that can detect manipulated images by looking at the patterns in each pixel. By applying a similar logic, they are trying to create a software that takes each frame of a given video and analyze it pixel by pixel in order to find the pattern of the original video and determine whether or not it has been manipulated. In addition to developing new technology that can detect any video manipulations, many researchers are raising the importance for private corporations creating stricter guidelines to protect individual privacy. With the development of artificial intelligence, it is necessary to ask how this impacts society today as it begins to appear in virtually every aspect of society, including medicine, education, politics, and the economy. Furthermore, artificial intelligence will begin to appear in various aspects of society, which makes it important to have laws that protect humans rights as technology takes over. As the private sector gains more digital power over the public, it is important to set strict regulations and laws to prevent private corporations from using personal data maliciously. Additionally, the past history of various data breaches and violations of privacy policy should also be a warning for how personal information can be accessed and used without the person‚Äôs consent. = Digital literacy = Another way to prevent being harmed by these technology is by educating people on the pros and cons of digital cloning. By doing so, it empowers each individual to make a rational decision based on their own circumstances. Furthermore, it is also important to educate people on how to protect the information they put out on the Internet. By increasing the digital literacy of the public, people have a greater chance of determining whether a given video has been manipulated as they can be more skeptical of the information they find online.

Robert Plant's Priory of Brion Edwards first came to prominence as the drummer in Robert Plant's Priory of Brion. Formed in 1999, the band performed over one hundred concerts across Europe. With the dissolution of this band in late 2000, Edwards became the UK's master drum clinician for Tama drums, performing at many of the major drum festivals and contributing to articles for a variety of drums magazines including Rhythm Magazine, Modern Drummer and Ragazzi. In 2001 readers of Rhythm Magazine voted Edwards as one of the top ten drum clinicians in the UK. In 2002 Edwards joined The Ian Parker Band and toured extensively across Europe and played on the albums Lost and Found (2003) and Inside (2003). IQ, Frost* and progressive rock In 2005 Edwards joined the neo-progressive IQ and toured Europe, US and Canada and performed on the DVD Stage (2006) and on the album Frequency (2009). He then formed the progressive rock supergroup Neo with members of IQ, Pendragon and Pallas and released the CD/DVD Broadcast (2006). in 2006 Edwards joined Frost* - a progressive band formed by the keyboardist Jem Godfrey (best known for his pop songwriting and production for Atomic Kitten, Shane Ward and Holly Vallance) - along with IQ bassist John Jowitt, and guitarist John Mitchell. Their debut album Milliontown (2006) was very well received among progressive rock fans and Edwards was voted in the top five progressive rock drummers in the world in the DPRP Poll two years in a row. In 2008 Frost released Experiments in Mass Appeal (2008). Edwards departed IQ and Frost in 2009 and moved into music education and session work. Edwards also contributed to sessions for Clive Nolan and Martin Orford. In 2010 he briefly rejoined his ex-bandmates in Frost* to contribute to the track ‚ÄúThe Dividing Line‚Äù which was released as a bonus track on the live Philadelphia Experiment album later that year. In 2013 Edwards was the guest drummer on The Twenty Seven Club by the progressive rock band Magenta and this session led to the formation of Kiama, with Magenta keyboardist Rob Reed. In 2010 Edwards became the course leader for music at Kidderminster College and recorded a number of experimental improvisatory albums with bassist Steve Lawson and performed on a number of recordings with the virtuoso guitarist Phi Yaan-Zek. Edwards has also been featured and contributed to a number of books about Robert Plant. In 2016 Edwards joined forces with former ELO and Move drummer Bev Bevan to form the double drummer rhythm section for the Birmingham folk rock band Quill and performed a number of concerts across the UK including a well received performance at Cropready Folk Festival in 2017.

Some subsects have women's rights issues, others enjoy a relatively progressive environment within their sects which is also dependent on the laws in the countries practicing this sect.  History  = Context of Ismailism = Ismailism is a sect within Islam that reveres a living Imam, who is a direct descendant of Ali and Fatima, the son-in-law and daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, respectively. His hereditary connection to the Prophet offers him the authority to serve as the spiritual (and non-spiritual) guide of the community. The Imam is the head of the Ismaili community and plays a role in interpreting the Quran with a special ability to understand the batin, the esoteric meanings of the religion. = Reforms accepted by Nizari Ismaili Imams = The Nizari Ismaili Imams (known as the Aga Khans since the 18th century have used their power to institute reforms in the status and treatment of women in the community. Aga Khan III, the 48th Nizari Ismaili Imam, was passionate in this movement. He came into his role at an early age, due to his father‚Äôs early death, so his mother, Lady Ali Shah, played an influential role during his early years. The influence of women during his rule continued in his later years with his wife Umm Habiba. Imam Aga Khan III ruled from 1885 to 1957 and the current 49th Imam, his grandson, Imam Aga Khan IV commenced his rule in 1957. A majority of Aga Khan III‚Äôs efforts sought to reform Islamic marriage contract laws which have significantly contributed to improving the status of women within the Nizari Ismaili community.  Reforms (on marriage, divorce, segregation and education)  The focus of Imam Aga Khan III‚Äôs message was to promote the idea that women were free and independent. In a message to his followers in 1926, he proclaimed that: > I do not want Ismaili women dependent on anyone‚Äîtheir parents, husbands, or > anyone except God‚Ä¶I have no doubt that the whole spirit and teaching of my > ancestor the Holy Prophet encouraged the evolution of all legitimate freedom > and legitimate equality before men and women. He encouraged women to participate in social and political affairs and criticized veiling as well as gender segregation, including the acts of pardah (masking of oneself from the public) and zenana (restraint on women from leaving the home). Aga Khan III believed economic independence was key to achieving this equality and freedom. By becoming educated and earning their own livelihood, women would no longer be a burden on their parents or spouses. He proclaimed: > I am trying to guide our young women‚Äôs lives into entirely new channels. I > want to see them able to earn their livings in trades and professions, so > that they are not economically dependent on marriage, nor a burden on their > fathers and brother[s]. In effect, marriage would no longer be imposed on women due to economic necessity. With this independence, Ismaili women possess greater choice and will when it comes to marriage. The Aga Khan III realized that education was at the forefront of this reform and encouraged parents who only had enough money to send one child to school to send their daughters. And this advocacy for education was not limited to elementary literacy. To ensure girls had access to education, there was a minimum marriageable age instituted (for both boys and girls) and child marriage was banned. Moreover, marriage against the will of the bride was outlawed as brides were to sign their marriage contracts according to their choice. Other reforms in marriage laws included decisions on polygamy and divorce. In 1905, polygamy was permitted with the condition of the \\"maintenance of the first wife\\" and later that was changed to only be allowed for specific reasons. In 1962, polygamy was outlawed within the Nizari Ismaili community. Women were allowed to divorce their husbands and for a husband to divorce his wife, he was required to stand before a council which ultimately decided whether the divorce was granted or denied. Additionally, Aga Khan III took efforts to eliminate and mitigate the stigma around divorces and divorced women. In prayer spaces, Ismaili men and women stand side by side (in other Muslim prayer settings, the men stand in front of the women) and are not separated by any physical barrier, as is the case in most Muslim mosques. Ismaili women are also permitted to lead the congregations (consisting of both men and women) in prayer.  Contemporary Efforts  The current Imam, Aga Khan IV, has taken a different approach to addressing the issue of women‚Äôs rights than his grandfather. While Imam Aga Khan III instituted direct legal and religious laws, the current Imam has focused on communal development in educational and social affairs. His style addresses his followers and pushes them to take initiative in achieving the desired results. His daughter, Princess Zahra Aga Khan, is also very engaged with working on policies relating to the development of women. In 1997, she hosted the first ever International Conference of Ismaili Women in Toronto.  Barriers to Realization of Reforms  A discrepancy exists between the rights offered to women through these reforms and the actual realization of the practice of those rights. Cultural norms and views continue to guide many members of the community who criticize the reforms as being influenced from western values. The Aga Khan responded to this critique by claiming that: > While the words of the Koran remain the same, every generation, every > century, every period must have a new and different interpretation of the > past, otherwise Islam will die and will not survive the competition of some > healthy less rigid competitors. Additional barriers to practice of reforms include the fact that the councils implementing the forms are often majority male who may still adhere to patriarchal norms. The laws of the countries in which Ismaili women reside also impact the implementation of reforms. Sharia law, common in most Sunni majority countries, is often in contrast to the Ismaili reforms and so residents of these countries must adhere to the country‚Äôs rules and regulations. The situation of Ismaili women depends on factors including their government and its laws, economic ability, resource availability, and global conditions.

She announced the publication of the book by surprise on April 23, 2019 on her Twitter account. Fern√°ndez de Kirchner stated that the book \\"is not autobiographical nor is it an enumeration of personal or political achievements, it is a look and a retrospective reflection to unravel some facts and chapters of recent history and how they have impacted the lives of Argentines and mine as well.\\" Released months before the general election, the release of Sinceramente was considered by some political analysts as the first sign of the launch of Fern√°ndez de Kirchner's presidential candidacy. However, Fern√°ndez de Kirchner announced on May 18 that she will be running for Vice President, accompanying her former Chief of the Cabinet Alberto Fern√°ndez as a candidate for the presidency. Although it was set to be released on April 26, the book began to be sold in Buenos Aires libraries the day before and sold out almost immediately. Sinceramente has been considered \\"the editorial phenomenon of the year\\", with the sixty thousand copies of the first edition selling out in one hour. As such, the \\"sales phenomenon\\" of they day of its publication has been compared to that of Argentine bestsellers Malvinas, la trama secreta (1983) and Nunca M√°s (1984). During the first two weeks after its release and before its official presentation, Sinceramente sold 300,000 copies and collected 120 million pesos. Reception Journalist Luis Majul considered that the book was not up to the standards of books written by former presidents, as it would not serve as a legacy or an ordered explanation of her ideas. Instead, it would be a disorganized selection of trivial anecdotes. He also pointed that most of the events are explained with a conspiracy theory of some sort.Sinceramente me decepcion√≥ Tour The book was first presented at the Buenos Aires International Book Fair. It was followed by events in La Matanza, La Plata, Mar del Plata and Malvinas Argentinas (Buenos Aires Province), Mendoza, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Misiones, Calafate and Rio Gallegos (Santa Cruz Province) and Rosario (Santa Fe province).

Shelley M. Richmond Joseph and Wesley MacGregor (2019) is the federal criminal prosecution of a Massachusetts state court judge (Joseph) and court officer (MacGregor) for helping a state court defendant evade federal immigration authorities by allowing him to leave a court hearing through a courthouse back door. Both Joseph and MacGregor are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice, aiding and abetting obstruction of justice, and aiding and abetting obstruction of a federal proceeding. MacGregor is also charged with perjury for giving false testimony in grand jury proceedings. Joseph faces 20 years in prison; MacGregor, 30. Both could be fined $250,000. On April 2, 2018, an agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrived at the Newton District Court in Newton, Massachusetts in order to detain a suspected undocumented immigrant who was appearing as a defendant that day on state court charges. According to federal prosecutors, Joseph and MacGregor helped the defendant evade detention by allowing him to leave the courthouse through a rear exit while the ICE agent waited in the front lobby. A grand jury investigation began within weeks and on April 25, 2019, Joseph and MacGregor were indicted. Joseph surrendered to authorities and MacGregor was arrested at home. Both pled not guilty and were released without bail. MacGregor retired and Joseph is on administrative leave with pay pending trial. A motion to dismiss filed by Joseph was denied, and as of July 2020, no trial date has been set. Federal prosecutions of state judges in the United States are extremely rare. This is the first prosecution of a sitting Massachusetts judge since 1787, when a judge was prosecuted for helping rebels in Shays' Rebellion. The case comes amid escalating tensions between the Trump administration and so-called \\"sanctuary cities\\" such as Newton, where local officials have openly refused to enforce the administration's immigration policies. Reactions to the prosecution are divided, and the case has resulted in legislation and additional lawsuits brought by both supporters and opponents, seeking to either loosen or strengthen enforcement of federal immigration laws in local courtrooms.  Background  Since taking office in 2017, the Republican Trump administration has prioritized reducing illegal and legal immigration, increased deportations, and revoked protections for immigrants allowed to stay in the United States. Democrats, immigration advocates, and others, have resisted these policies, believing they are unfair and antithetical to American values. Trump has regularly criticized \\"sanctuary cities\\" and states that have refused to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. In 2018, Trump publicly urged then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to bring charges for obstruction of justice against Oakland, California mayor Libby Schaaf for warning Oakland residents about an impending raid by the federal federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. By April 2019, the Trump administration was in a \\"standoff\\" with sanctuary cities over local enforcement of Trump immigration policies. That month, Trump suggested busing migrants from the US border to sanctuary cities, which critics called callous and allies called impractical. Though not the first or only state where local officials have refused to enforce Trump's immigration policies, Massachusetts has been a leading state in the sanctuary city movement. The legal fight over ICE detentions has strained the state court system. Massachusetts state courts passed legal rulings limiting the ability of ICE agents to detain immigrants at state courthouses. According to a retired state court judge, federal immigration authorities were \\"furious\\" at the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), the state's highest court, for a 2017 ruling that state courts could not hold people solely because of ICE detainers.Lunn v. Commonwealth, Mass. 2017 The SJC ruled that state law enforcement officials lacked the authority under state law to detain a person based on an ICE detainer. Massachusetts courts have also issued rules requiring judges and their staff to neither assist nor obstruct federal immigration authorities. In response to the 2017 SJC ruling, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican, filed legislation that would have given state officers authority to honor ICE detainer requests for criminal suspects and convicts. Republicans in the Massachusetts House of Representatives have also introduced similar bills and budget amendments. As of April 2019, none have passed. Thomas Homan In 2018, ICE's then-acting director Thomas Homan issued a policy directive allowing agents to enter state courthouses to arrest unauthorized immigrants. Judges, lawyers, and other advocates criticized the Trump administration for increasing courthouse arrests of immigrants, arguing it disrupts the criminal justice system, \\"scaring people away from halls of justice\\". The Trump administration resisted calls to designate courthouses, like schools and places of worship, as \\"sensitive locations\\" that are free from immigration enforcement, arguing that courthouse arrests are safer for agents because visitors are screened by metal detectors before entering a courthouse.  People involved  = Shelley Joseph = Massachusetts state district court judge Shelley Richmond Joseph graduated from Boston College in 1989 with a degree in political science and romance languages. She attended New England School of Law, graduating in 1992. Prior to becoming a judge, Joseph worked for 25 years as both a prosecutor and defense attorney. In the 1990s, Joseph served a term on the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee. She worked on Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. After the campaign, she briefly worked for Marc Pacheco as legislative counsel. In 1993, she joined the Massachusetts Attorney General's office, where she worked as an assistant attorney general until 2000, under former Massachusetts Attorney Generals Scott Harshbarger and Thomas Reilly. After the Attorney General's office, Joseph worked for Boston law firm Swartz & Swartz for a short time, before she and her husband founded a law firm, Joseph & Joseph, in 2003. Joseph's practice focused on criminal defense. In the fall of 2017, Joseph was nominated for a judgeship by Republican governor Charlie Baker. Nobody spoke in opposition at her nomination hearing on October 11, 2017. She was approved unanimously by the Massachusetts Governor's Council in October, and was sworn in five months prior to the incident. Joseph worked as an associate justice of the district court in Framingham, where she presided over cases involving misdemeanors and minor felonies. She occasionally worked at the district court in Newton as a visiting judge. Joseph was 51 at the time she was indicted. While the case proceeded, Joseph trained for her fourth marathon. = Wesley MacGregor = Wesley MacGregor, a former court officer, was 56 when he was indicted. MacGregor retired as a court officer in March 2019. = Jose Medina- Perez = Jose Medina-Perez, a 38-year-old undocumented immigrant from the Dominican Republic, had been arrested in Newton, a sanctuary city since 2017, on March 30, 2018 on narcotics possession charges and for being a fugitive from Pennsylvania. Medina-Perez, who also used the name Oscar Manuel Peguero, was linked to an eight-year-old drunk driving warrant from Pennsylvania. However, both the state prosecutor and the defense attorney agreed that Medina-Perez was not the same person who was wanted in Pennsylvania. Medina- Perez was held at a jail in Billerica. His fingerprints matched with someone who was deported from the US twice, in 2003 and 2007, and barred from re- entering the US until 2027. ICE issued a detainer for Medina-Perez after learning of his detention when his fingerprints were submitted to a national law enforcement database by local police.  Alleged release of state court defendant  On April 2, 2018, Medina-Perez was brought to the Newton District Court, described by The New York Times as \\"a sleepy, two-room courthouse in a wealthy, liberal suburb.\\" According to the indictment, at 9:30 a.m., a plainclothed ICE officer arrived to observe the hearing and detain Medina- Perez if he were released. The hearing began at 2:48 p.m. While Medina-Perez was sitting in a glass prisoner's dock next to the judge's bench, Joseph told the court clerk to ask the ICE officer to exit the courtroom and wait outside in the lobby. According to Joseph, she was complying with Newton District Court's established policy at the time. According to the indictment, the ICE officer was told that if Medina-Perez were released, he would leave through the lobby. Joseph held a sidebar conference with the state prosecutor and Medina-Perez's defense attorney. Medina-Perez denied being wanted by ICE. Medina-Perez was eligible to be released on bail bond, and during the sidebar conference, Medina-Perez's attorney told Joseph that Medina-Perez had an ICE detainer, and that if he were returned to the Billerica jail and released from there, ICE would apprehend him. Joseph instructed the court clerk to deactivate the audio recorder in the courtroom, allegedly in violation of Massachusetts courtroom rules. The recording remained off for 52 seconds. According to the indictment, the recorder was reactivated at 2:41 p.m. The state prosecutor asked Joseph to dismiss the fugitive warrant because Medina- Perez did not resemble the mugshot of the Pennsylvania fugitive. Joseph granted the request and the fugitive charge was dismissed. The drug possession charge did not require Medina-Perez to be held in custody, and would be the subject of a pre-trial conference held at a later date. Joseph ordered Medina- Perez to be released. Medina-Perez's attorney told Joseph that Medina-Perez had some property \\"downstairs\\", and asked for permission to speak with Medina- Perez \\"downstairs with the interpreter\\". According to the indictment, Joseph ordered Medina-Perez to exit through the basement lockup facility. MacGregor escorted Medina-Perez, his attorney, and an interpreter to the court's basement lockup facility, where at 3:01 p.m. he used his security access card to open a rear exit to a public parking lot and allow Medina-Perez to leave the courthouse. The ICE officer was not informed and remained in the lobby until the court closed at 4:30 p.m. The New York Times reported that Medina- Perez \\"climbed over a fence at the back of the courthouse parking lot.\\" He was arrested by police again later the same month, and again faced deportation.  Pre-trial proceedings  US v. Joseph is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, housed in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston News of Medina-Perez's release from custody reached ICE headquarters in Washington, D.C. within hours. ICE's then-director of enforcement and removal operations Matthew Albence informed acting ICE director Thomas Homan later that day. Homan believed it was clearly obstruction of justice, but ICE did not have the legal authority to prosecute; only a US Attorney could seek an indictment. According to The New York Times, \\"The idea of such a prosecution was popular in Washington.\\" A grand jury was convened within weeks and proceedings continued for a year. MacGregor testified before the grand jury on July 12, 2018. On December 1, 2018, The Boston Globe reported that a grand jury was investigating Joseph for obstruction of justice. = Indictment and plea = On April 25, 2019, Joseph and MacGregor were indicted and charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice (Count I), aiding and abetting obstruction of justice (Count II), and aiding and abetting obstruction of a federal proceeding (Count III). MacGregor was also charged with perjury (Count IV) for lying to the grand jury, by allegedly telling them he was unaware of Medina-Perez's ICE detainer. Prosecutors also allege that MacGregor made \\"false statements\\" to state judges investigating the matter about the reason for the courtroom recorder being disabled. MacGregor allegedly said the reason was \\"unfamiliarity\\" with the equipment. Joseph faces 20 years in prison; MacGregor, 30. Both could be fined $250,000. Joseph surrendered herself to authorities. MacGregor was arrested at his home. Prosecutors said they were unable to reach him before officers arrived to arrest him. Joseph and MacGregor pleaded not guilty. Both Joseph and MacGregor were released without bail. MacGregor was required to surrender his licensed firearm, and both he and Joseph were required to surrender their passports and were restricted from traveling outside the US. In July 2019, federal prosecutors offered Joseph and MacGregor a plea deal. The offer to Joseph would have required her to admit to violating federal law, but allowed her to avoid prosecution. Joseph rejected the offer; as of July 25, 2019, MacGregor had not yet responded the offer. = Suspension and legal fees = The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), the state's highest court, suspended Joseph without pay on the day she was indicted. She asked the SJC to restore her pay and allow her to work on administrative tasks for the courts while the case against her proceeded. Lawyers' and retired judges' groups supported Joseph's request. The SJC held a hearing on June 26, 2019. On August 13, 2019, in a 43-page, 5‚Äì1 decision, the SJC ordered the restoration of Joseph's $181,328 salary, with benefits and $51,000 in backpay retroactive to April 25, 2019. Chief Justice Ralph Gants wrote for the court, \\"In turbulent times, the risk of being stripped of a paycheck may have a chilling effect on a judge‚Äôs willingness to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor and thereby diminish the overall independence of the judiciary.\\" The sole dissenting justice, Frank Gaziano, wrote that the court's decision \\"smacks of preferential treatment, and thereby erodes public confidence in the judiciary\\". Although Joseph's salary was restored, the SJC unanimously voted against her request to be assigned to administrative duties during her suspension. Judge Joseph was suspended without pay after her indictment and the State of Massachusetts paid legals fees, amounting to $127,000 prior to the indictment being handed down. Joseph was suspended without her $184,600 annual salary and a GoFundMe campaign was created to help the judge pay legal fees. Wesley MacGregor has also received $2,500 for legal fees from the state. = Motion to dismiss = In September 2019, Joseph filed a motion to dismiss the charges against her, which she called \\"unprecedented\\", asserting that \\"no state judge has ever been prosecuted for not facilitating the immigration policies of the federal government\\". A group of 61 retired Massachusetts judges, together with US law professors and others, filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the motion to dismiss, arguing that \\"Occasionally frustrating the expectations of the executive branch is a core function of an independent judiciary.\\" The brief contended that Joseph wasn't obstructing justice but ensuring it, and that \\"if Judge Joseph is prosecuted, every Massachusetts judge in every Massachusetts courthouse will feel a constant external pressure to refrain from actions that might antagonize federal officials\\". The court denied the motion on July 27, 2020. Impact and reactions Nationwide, federal prosecutions of state judges are exceedingly rare. Joseph's indictment was the first time a sitting judge was indicted for criminal behavior in Massachusetts since 1787, when a judge was found guilty of libel and removed from the bench for defending farmers involved in Shays' Rebellion. The \\"closely-watched case\\" drew national attention and sparked a debate about states refraining from carrying out the \\"increasingly tough\\" immigration policies of the Trump administration. An article in USA Today described it as \\"an unusual escalation in the federal government's strict immigration enforcement policy, and its battles with states and local governments that shelter migrants\\". Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham described the case as an example of \\"activist judges undermining Trump's immigration policies\\". US Attorney Andrew Lelling led the prosecution The New York Times reported that some members of Massachusetts's legal and immigration rights community have \\"kept a distance\\" from Joseph, \\"in part because the evidence against her was damning\\", but that \\"legal heavyweights have rallied in her defense,\\" arguing that United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling, who oversaw the prosecution, \\"crossed a line by indicting a state judge, inviting the use of federal power to intimidate state officials into compliance.\\" Boston newspapers have reported regularly on the case. One letter-writer to The Boston Globe compared Joseph with Henry David Thoreau and Martin Luther King Jr. Writing in The Boston Herald, right-wing radio host Howie Carr called Joseph \\"a lawless, privileged moonbat judge ... hoping for an O. J. Simpson-like jury nullification from 12 Democrats afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome.\\" Supporters of Joseph warned that the federal case will lead to the prosecution of more judges, undermining judicial independence. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey criticized the indictment as \\"a radical and politically motivated attack on our state and the independence of our courts\\" and \\"misuse of prosecutorial resources\\". Lelling denied that the indictment was meant to send a political message, saying, \\"We did not bring this case in response to the public debate over immigration enforcement\\". The Massachusetts chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) described the case as \\"preposterous, ironic, and deeply damaging to the rule of law,\\" saying the decision \\"seems to have little to do with the actual facts, and everything to do with enforcing the president's anti-immigrant agenda\\". Massachusetts ACLU director Carol Rose called the case \\"outrageous\\", saying that Joseph must prioritize ensuring fair access to justice, and that ICE agents posted in courthouses could deter immigrants from going to court or reporting crimes, depriving them of their right to justice. After the indictment, Rose called on the Massachusetts state legislature to pass the Safe Communities Act (H.3724), also known as the \\"Access to Justice Bill\\", which would reduce state law enforcement's ability to coordinate with ICE. During grand jury investigations in December 2018, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker called for Joseph to be temporarily removed from office. Baker supported Joseph's suspension following her indictment, issuing a statement saying that \\"no one should obstruct federal law enforcement officials trying to do their jobs\\" and noting that his administration \\"has filed legislation to allow court officials as well as law-enforcement to work with federal immigration officials to detain dangerous individuals.\\" In April 2019, two Massachusetts district attorneys filed a lawsuit against ICE to stop its practice of apprehending people at Massachusetts courthouses. The lawsuit said the arrests deter victims and witnesses from seeking relief from and cooperating with the courts. According to the suit, ICE's courthouse arrests violate defendants constitutional rights and have prevented some immigrants from receiving court-ordered drug and mental health services, and caused others to violate their probation or otherwise default on court orders. On June 20, 2019, federal judge Indira Talwani granted a preliminary injunction in the case temporarily prohibiting ICE agents from making arrests at Massachusetts courthouses. By July 2019, the lawsuit was being pursed by a coalition of district attorneys, public defenders, and other advocates.

In 1958, Hoogerbrug was responsible for executing the Firth Concrete offices in Karamu Street North, Hastings, designed by Maurice K. Smith, but with some modifications by Hoogerbrug. The spatial atmosphere, geometry and glazed gable ends of the Firth building anticipate Hoogerbrug's design for St James's Anglican Church in Duke Street, Hastings (1963), as well as John Scott's celebrated 1961 Futuna Chapel. In the early 1960s, Hoogerbrug made an extended overseas tour through Australia, Asia, and Europe, and in 1963 he completed St James's Church in Hastings, which received a New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) merit award in 1964. About the same time, Hoogerbrug entered into partnership with John Scott, which continued until 1972. During this period, Hoogerbrug designed the Ahuriri Tavern (1965) on West Quay, Ahuriri, which gained a NZIA merit award in 1969. In 1975, Hoogerbrug joined Paris Magdalinos in partnership, and they were later joined by engineer Bruce Williams to form Hoogerbrug, Magdalinos and Williams. Hoogerbrug's St Andrew's Presbyterian Church (1979) in Market Street, Hastings, and Seventh Day Adventist Church (1986) in Ada Street, Hastings, were both awarded NZIA branch awards, in 1980 and 1989, respectively. =Works= Works by Hoogerbrug include: * Van Bohemen house, Havelock North (1957) * Firth Concrete offices, Hastings (1958) * Te Mata shops, Havelock North (1959) * St James' Church, Hastings (1963) * Ahuriri Tavern, Napier (1965) * Peterfield Properties offices, Waipukurau (1966) * Crippled Children's Society headquarters, Napier (1967) * Havelock Ski Club, Whakapapa skifield (1967) * Leopard Inn, Napier (1970) * Tamatea Tavern, Napier (1977) * St Andrew's Church, Hastings (1979) * Havelock North public library, Havelock North (1980) * Hawke's Bay Power Board building, Hastings (1983) * Seventh Day Adventist Church, Parkvale, Hastings (1986) * Napier Boys' High School dormitory, Napier (1990) * Flaxmere Policing Centre, Flaxmere (1991) * Kerry Stone General Motors, Hastings (1991) Death Hoogerbrug died in Hastings on 16 April 2019.

He held numerous patents related to the production and use of rare earths and the production of glass, enamels, and synthetic resins. In addition to founding the chemical company Vereinigte Chemischen Fabriken (VCF), he became a major shareholder in , a leading glass manufacturer. In the 1930s Kreidl became a target of the National Socialists. During the Anschluss his wife Eva died, and his possessions were confiscated. Kreidl and his three sons were able to leave Austria and emigrate to the United States. After the end of World War II they were able to reclaim some of his business assets. Early life Ignaz Kreidl was born on December 11, 1869 in Gratzen, Austria-Hungary (now Nov√© Hrady (ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice District), South Bohemian Region, Czech Republic). Education Kreidl became a student at the University of Vienna, and worked as an assistant to Adolf Lieben. He obtained his degree in 1892. In 1891, while still a student, Kreidl began working with Carl Auer von Welsbach to produce a newer design for the gas mantle which was used for street lights. They formed a company which specialized in the use of rare earths in glassmaking. Rare earths such as cerium, neodymium and praseodymium are used for polishing glass, for the creation of specific colors and visual effects, and for optical properties which they can impart to glass. Kreidl rose from the position of research chemist to research manager and co-manager of production at the Welsbach company. By 1906, Kreidl was unhappy in the position and sought new opportunities. Life in Vienna =A family in business= The Kreidl and Heller families were closely connected. Ignaz' sister Mathilde (1868-1926) was married to industrialist Gustav Heller (1857-1937). In 1908, Ignaz Kreidl and Gustav Heller formed the Kreidl and Heller company. On October 1, 1910, \\"Dr. Kreidl und Heller\\" (shareholders: Gustav Heller and Ignaz Kreidl) merged with another producer of chemical products, \\"Landau & Co\\" (shareholders: Horace Landau and Karl Rosenzweig) to form \\"Vereinigte Chemischen Fabriken, Kreidl, Heller & Co.\\" (VCF). As of 1912, the company's address was XXI Sebastian-Kohlgasse 5-9, Vienna, Austria, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. VCF was involved in the production of rare earths, which were used to create glass, enamels, and synthetic resins. Kreidl led a strong research program that resulted in the registration of a number of patents relating to the production of resins, glass, and enamels. These included processes such as the manufacturing of opaquing agents for white enamel, which could be used in dentistry. The company was also active in other areas. It made agricultural products such as sulfur-based weed sprays to combat pests in orchards, vineyards and gardens. It produced salts for pickling and canning. It also produced saccharin, under the brand name \\"Kandisin\\". Among Kreidl's many patents are a number relating to the use of saccharin by diabetics. The company even published a cookbook of saccharine recipes, Mein 's√º√ües' Kochbuch. Die Verwendung von S√º√üstoff, Tabletten-, und Kristalls√º√üstoff und Kandiset f√ºr Speisen und Getr√§nke jeder Art (My \\"sweet\\" cookbook. The use of sweetener, tablet, and crystal sweetener and candy for food and drinks of any kind). Ignaz Kreidl was a highly respected scientist and industrialist. He held over two hundred patents, in multiple countries, in the areas of glass, resins, plastics, photochemical processing, enamel ware and porcelain enamels. He funded scholarships at the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna, supporting students such as Elizabeth Rona. =A family of scientists= Ignaz Kreidl had three sons by his first wife, Hilda (d. 1921): Norbert J. Kreidl (1904-1994), Werner H. Kreidl (1906-1989), and Ekkehard L. Kreidl (1910-1977). Werner studied chemistry; Norbert majored in physics with a minor in chemistry; and Ekkehard became a physicist. Werner worked with Ignaz at the Vereinigten Chemischen Fabriken, Kreidl, Heller & Co., in Vienna, and was trained to become his successor. Norbert J. Kreidl entered the University of Vienna as a chemistry student, but soon joined physicist Otto Pettersson at the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna. Norbert Kreidl completed his doctorate in physics with a minor in chemistry, receiving degrees in 1925 and 1927. He then spent a post-doctoral year at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin with Woldemar Weyl. Ignaz Kreidl had acquired a major interest in one of the most prestigious Czechoslovakian glass manufacturers in Europe, J. Schreiber & Neffen. Schreiber's had factories in Reitendorf, Moravia and in Lednicke Rovne, Slovakia. Its central office was in Vienna until 1919. After World War I ended, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved, the head office was moved to Reitendorf to satisfy the government of Czechoslovakia. The company employed over 1,100 skilled workers, many from traditional glassmaking families. Norbert Kreidl was sent to manage the Schreiber Glassworks and started a research laboratory, the Glass Research Institute, in Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Czechoslovakia. There he met and married a granddaughter of the glassworks' founding family, Melanie Schreiber. Austria and National Socialism =Between the wars= The inter-war period was a time of considerable economic instability. Creditanstalt-Weiner Bankverein (CA), the major bank in Austria, managed to survive World War I, the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a world-wide financial crisis during the Great Depression, and two rounds of government-related reorganization in 1931 and 1933. In 1913 CA was effectively a multi-national, with interests in 102 companies that included banking, insurance, natural resources, manufacturing, and industry. By 1934, it had become \\"Austrified\\". It was primarily owned by the Austrian state, to service the Austrian economy and business interests. There had been significant turnover among its leadership. The Chancellor of Austria, among others, made Jews a convenient scapegoat for the economic crash, and institutions were being \\"Aryanized\\" by firing Jewish personnel. =The Anschluss= Conditions in Austria worsened significantly after the Anschluss on March 12, 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. As a result of the Anschluss, CA again faced shifting political boundaries and their social, economic, and industrial impacts. Social and legal pressures for Aryanization increased. Being declared Jewish meant that your possessions could be confiscated and you could be arrested. For companies, being classed as German rather than Austrian meant that companies faced potential losses in international markets due to anti-German boycotts. At the same time, as Germany took over other countries, companies had the potential to expand within Germany's enlarged political boundaries. As the Nazis took over Austrian banking and government, there was intense internal rivalry between Nazi factions and informal groups who sought to control the distribution of assets that were being confiscated from Viennese Jews. =Impact on the Kreidls= Kreidl and his family belonged to a complex network of people connected by personal as well scientific and business ties. Like many others in Austria and Germany, the Kreidls were of Jewish descent, but were largely assimilated: they were not observant. Ignaz Kreidl himself was far from the racist stereotypes promoted by the National Socialists: he had blue eyes, fair hair and a commanding presence. Regardless, he and his family were considered by the Nazis to be Jewish. The Kreidls were targeted almost immediately. On the evening of March 18, 1938, less than a week after Austria was annexed, the records of the Federal Police Directorate of Vienna show that Ignaz Kreidl's home was searched by police officers. Ignaz Kreidl, his second wife Eva, his sister-in-law Dr. Marianne Kreidl and Dr. Hilde Math√© were all present. Police officers took items including money, jewelry, and business letters. Ignaz Kreidl was arrested and imprisoned without charge for two days. He was released on Sunday, March 20, 1938, to learn that his wife Eva had fallen from the fourth floor of their building and was dead. =Aryanization of J. Schreiber & Neffen= Ignaz Kreidl was a major stockholder in J. Schreiber & Neffen, one of the leading glass manufacturers in Austria-Hungary. Kreidl owned 8,512 shares in Schreiber, almost half of the company's total of 20,000 shares. An additional 4,430 shares belonged to Frederike Selahettin, who was also considered Jewish by the National Socialists. The remainder were still held by the Schreiber family, who had been considered Aryan. Effective June 15, 1938, the Schreiber company was \\"Aryanized\\". The possessions of Kreidl and Selahettin were confiscated by the Gestapo and declared to be the property of \\"the Land of Austria\\". Selling the shares \\"at the best possible price\\" proved particularly difficult because some of the company's assets were outside German jurisdiction: There were Schreiber factories in Czechoslovakia, which were not at the time under German control. One of Creditanstalt-Weiner Bankverein's holdings was a glass company, St√∂lzle Glasindustrie AG. CA and St√∂lzle were both interested parties in the acquisition of Schreiber, but their interests did not always align with those of authorities in Reichenberg and Troppau. In spite of concerns that the Schreiber factories would be unable to pay their bills and would lose their skilled workforce, negotiations took more than a year. Special arrangements had to be made to deal with assets that were now in different countries. Finally, the sale of the Schreiber shares to St√∂lzle was approved. =Aryanization of Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken Kreidl, Heller & Co.= Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken Kreidl, Heller & Co. (VCF) was also Aryanized. At the time, Ignaz Kreidl owned 75% of the shares of the company he had founded. The remainder was held by Karl Theodor Rutter, whose wife Margarete Grethe Rutter was the daughter of Gustav Heller and Mathilde (Kreidl) Heller. Margarete Rutter was therefore both the daughter of Ignaz Kreidl's original partner in the firm, and Kreidl's niece. Karl Rutter was arrested in May 1938 as part of the Aryanization process and detained for three months. VCF's appropriation by the Nazis has been described as \\"a prime example of systemic corruption in National Socialism\\" (\\"Ein Paradebeispiel f√ºr die systemimmanente Korruption im Nationalsozialismus\\"). Acting superintendent SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Fridolin Glass was the person in charge of selling the company after its appropriation. Glass himself had neither financial assets nor business experience. He was, however, in a position to arrange for the arrest of Karl Rutter in May 1938, and the forcible removal of money, securities and documents from the VCF factory. Through a series of dubious assessments he ensured that the company was vastly undervalued. After a series of highly questionable actions involving multiple parties, the renamed \\"Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken Wien-Floridsdorf\\" became the property of Fridolin Glass. Fridolin Glass was sent to Russia where he was killed in action on February 21, 1943. His will of February 4, 1943 left his assets to other Viennese SS members with substantial bequests to his wife Ilse Glass and his parents. Emigration to America Between 1937 and 1940, Ignaz, his three sons, and various other family members were able to leave Austria and emigrate to the United States. Ekkehard left in 1937, eventually settling in Wayland, Massachusetts. Norbert and Melanie used the opportunity of attending a meeting in New York to escape in 1938. Werner was able to leave Austria in 1939. Ignaz travelled to Great Britain in 1938, and then to the United States in 1939, where he became an American citizen. All four men are included in the membership roster of the American Ceramic Society for 1945. Ignaz and Werner are listed at 155 Waverly Place, New York; Norbert at 475 Gardham Rd., Rochester, NY; and M. Sgt. E. L. Kreidl at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. After moving to the United States, Ignaz and Werner established the Kreidl Chemico-Physical Corporation, New York, N. Y. Ekkehard L. Kreidl became a research physicist for the Radiation Branch of the Engineering Board of the United States Army, and later worked on air quality control for Arthur D. Little, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. and Kaiser Steel. Norbert Kreidl became an internationally respected glass scientist. Initially he joined his former professor, Woldemar Weyl, at Pennsylvania State College. He later became head of materials and development at Bausch and Lomb Optical Company and taught at the University of Missouri-Rolla. In addition he was a consultant to NASA, president of the International Commission on Glass, and active in organizing a series of international glass conferences. Following the second world war, Norbert established a fund to support students of his former teacher, Adolf Smekal, in Graz. He named it the Ignaz Kreidl Fund. Ignaz' sister-in-law, Marianne Kreidl (n√©e von Bronneck), one of the earliest women chemists to attend Vienna University, also emigrated to the United States and found work in 1938. Her husband, Ignaz' brother Alexandre, had died December 29, 1937. Candy-maker John Heller (originally \\"Hans\\"), a son of Gustav Heller and Mathilde Kreidl, emigrated from Vienna to New York in 1940. There he founded Heller Candy Inc. Reparations Following the war, Ignaz Kreidl was able to regain some company assets, in particular some of those stolen by Fridolin Glass, by appealing to the Property Control Branch of the U.S. Allied Commission for Austria (USACA), 1945-1950. Following Ignaz' death in 1947, his son Werner took on responsibility for the European holdings. The original company site had been significantly damaged by bombers near the end of World War II. Kreidl was able to obtain funds to rebuild because of the Marshall Plan. The company \\"Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken Kreidl, Rutter & Co.\\" was formed in 1949, and gradually resumed production. By 1961, with 400 employees, the company was able to supply 80-90% of Austria's market for plastics, resins, and other products it produced. External links The J.

A native of Wichita, Kansas, Hull had an isolated childhood marked by a deep interest in reading, particularly works by absurdist writers and leftist thinkers. While studying at Washington University in St. Louis in the early 1970s, he pursued courses of a similar political vein before a friend introduced him to rock criticism, a flourishing field at the time. Hull began writing criticism for The Village Voice in the mid 1970s under the mentorship of its music editor Robert Christgau, but left the field to pursue a career in software design and engineering during the 1980s and 1990s. His work for different software companies developing operating systems such as Unix would earn him the majority of his life's income. In the 2000s, he returned to music reviewing and wrote a jazz column for The Village Voice in the manner of Christgau's \\"Consumer Guide\\", alongside contributions to Seattle Weekly, The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, NPR Music, and the webzine Static Multimedia. Hull's jazz-focused database and blog, Tom Hull ‚Äì on the Web, hosts his reviews and information on albums he has surveyed, as well as writings on books, politics, and movies. It shares a functional, low-graphic design with Christgau's website, which Hull also created and maintains as its webmaster.  Early life and education  Hull was born in 1950 and raised in Wichita, Kansas.; . His mother Bessie (nicknamed Bea) was a homemaker, and his father Carl worked for Boeing, and he grew up with two younger siblings, Steve and Kathy.; . Hull describes his childhood as being \\"very isolated\\" and \\"miserable\\". He particularly disliked high school, beginning in the 8th grade, and recalls losing enthusiasm for his \\"first love\\" of science in the 9th grade because of a \\"brutish\\" teacher. About two years later, in January 1966, he dropped out of high school and entered \\"a very anti-intellectual phase\\", interested mainly with race cars. Soon after, he began to read books, frequenting the library and bookstores. Having disliked much of his high school's literature curriculum, Hull gravitated toward Dada and beat writers. He recalls his first book purchase to be The Theatre of the Absurd (1962) by Martin Esslin, which led him to related works by the writers Samuel Beckett, Eug√®ne Ionesco, and Jean Genet, as well as the publisher Grove Press and the literary magazine Evergreen Review. The New Radicals, a 1966 collection of documents from radical groups, edited by Saul Landau and Paul Jacobs, impacted Hull profoundly. It offered him a \\"New Left\\" political mindset to help rationalize his anti-Vietnam War stance, while leading him to similarly-minded magazines such as Ramparts, The Realist, Liberation, and The New York Review of Books. After reading Staughton Lynd's 1968 book Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism, which Hull says suited his idealistic and na√Øve ideas about U.S. history, he was shocked to read the Marxist historian Eugene Genovese's severally critical appraisal of the book in The New York Review of Books. Hull wrote a letter to Genovese protesting the review, prompting Genovese to send back a response. At Genovese's suggestion, Hull read his other published works and consequently took an interest in Marxist schools of thought such as the Frankfurt School. Brookings Hall on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, where Hull attended college Hull spent five years reading in his room, occasionally writing, and keeping to himself, before considering college. He attended Wichita State University for one year, before transferring to Washington University in St. Louis. There, he contributed to Paul Piccone's philosophical journal Telos, edited the \\"quasi-student paper\\" Notes on Everyday Life, and attended classes taught by leftist thinkers, with Steven Schwarzschild impressing Hull the most. One day, fellow student and friend Don Malcolm shared an essay on the Beach Boys with Hull, who had not been familiar with the band's music since the mid 1960s. Hull was highly skeptical of Malcolm's ideas, specifically his connecting the music to \\"high art\\", but their argument sparked Hull's interest in rock criticism, which was a burgeoning field at the time.; . As Hull recounts:  Career  = 1970s: Beginnings as a rock critic = Hull's first foray into music criticism began around 1974, after Malcolm had encouraged him to write. Hull read rock-centric magazines like Crawdaddy and Creem, finding encouragement to listen studiously to music and recover from the exhaustion of studying Marxism. \\"As I rebounded, I found pleasure in rock and a subject for my critical proclivites\\", he later explained. At the time, Hull worked in a typesetting shop in St. Louis, one of whose clients was St. Louis Today, an alternative weekly newspaper that did not have a regular music columnist. Hull offered himself in the role to the newspaper, who agreed but went out of business before they could publish any of his writing. One of Hull's earliest writings was a review of The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau's 1973 essay collection Any Old Way You Choose It. In it, Hull asserted that anyone can write rock criticism, leading him to write \\"The Rekord Report\\", which imitated Christgau's popular \\"Consumer Guide\\" album-review column. Hull's reviews were published as a four-page insert in Don Malcolm's Overdose, a collection of Malcolm's columns for Washington University's student paper. Hull performed the collection's layout and typesetting in exchange. After Hull's friends encouraged him to send Christgau the Overdose insert, Christgau sent him back a letter offering a job to write at The Village Voice in New York under his editorship.; . His first assignment was to review the 1975 Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive album Four Wheel Drive. \\"Unfortunately, the [album] was their worst to date, but Christgau and I had sort of a working class bond over the band\\", he recalls. While he says Christgau had \\"welcomed me to New York, and further extended my ears ‚Ä¶ by 1979 or so my desire to write rock crit was flagging, and everyday life was moving on\\", citing in part the limited workload afforded to him by the Voice. He left the newspaper around 1980, but would later serve as a resource for Christgau's decade-encompassing \\"Consumer Guide\\" collection, Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990).; . = 1980s‚Äì1990s: Career in software = A Z80 processor board, similar to Hull's for his early software designs Beginning in 1980, Hull worked in software engineering and design, which would earn him most of his life's income. He started by designing software that would execute operating systems for typesetting, first working on an Apple II computer, which he quickly traded for a S-100 bus with Zilog Z80 processor. In his first five years, Hull worked software jobs in New Jersey and Massachusetts, and eventually became the resident Unix systems specialist at a startup company that built a 3D modeling computer-aided design system intended for prepress and packaging design. His job there at various points entailed staff management and leadership of special projects. Hull also worked on free and open source software, such as Linux. After more than 10 years at the startup company, he left to pursue his own business involving a free software program he had designed. However, the venture failed, and Hull returned to New Jersey to work at a Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) facility. There, he developed kernels for the UnixWare system. In 2000, after the dot-com bubble hurt SCO's value and marked the company's imminent end, Hull was laid off and moved back to Wichita to find a scarcity of good jobs. He considered website design, consulting, and starting a home automation business as potential pursuits, but ultimately wanted to write again. = 2000s: Return to writing and web design = After his dismissal from SCO, Hull created an online database ‚Äì tomhull.com. It features his past and contemporaneous writings and a catalog of primarily jazz-based records and reviews, which adopt the grading schema from Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s (2000).; . The jazz focus originates from Hull's personal collection, gradually built from reading jazz critics Gary Giddins and Francis Davis in the 1970s and 1980s, and from more thorough research of the jazz canon when Hull lost interest in rock during the 1990s, citing the period's domination by grunge and gangsta rap. In 2001, Hull also created Christgau's website ‚Äì robertchristgau.com ‚Äì at the latter's apartment in New York, where Hull's trip from Wichita had been prolonged by the September 11 attacks and the death of his nephew's wife in the World Trade Center.; . The website made the majority of Christgau's published writings and reviews freely available for public viewing. The idea for the site was conceived by Hull and went into development after Christgau embraced it in mid 2001. Hull's background in software lent him the expertise to create the website, adhering to a minimalist aesthetic favoring text over graphics, similar to his own site. After robertchristgau.com went online, Christgau called Hull \\"a computer genius as well as an excellent and very knowledgeable music critic\\", and said that \\"the design of the website, especially its high searchability and small interest in graphics, are his idea of what a useful music site should be.\\" Hull remained involved with the site as webmaster, a role which author and Oxford Brookes University music lecturer Dai Griffiths later applauded. \\"Anyone who studies Christgau is indebted to Tom Hull for his magisterial work on Christgau's website\\", Griffiths wrote in 2019 in the academic journal Rock Music Studies. Robert Christgau (pictured in 2010) ‚Äì Hull's original mentor, longtime friend, and colleague In 2003, Hull was enlisted by Rolling Stone editor Christian Hoard to contribute entries for The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004). In February of that year, Hull also began writing \\"Recycled Goods\\" ‚Äì a \\"Consumer Guide\\"-style column on archival music releases and reissues ‚Äì for the Chicago-based webzine Static Multimedia at the behest of its editor Michael Tatum. In 2005, Christgau asked Hull to replace Giddins, The Village Voices longtime jazz columnist, who had quit. Although Christgau was dismissed from the Voice by new ownership the following year, Hull's \\"Jazz Consumer Guide\\" continued to be published in the paper for the next several years. During this period, he also contributed to Seattle Weekly. Hull's \\"Consumer Guide\\" reviews encouraged him to survey more jazz records for his own website, which was later expanded as Tom Hull ‚Äì on the Web to include blog writings on movies, politics, and books. As he explains in 2014, \\"I've written several million words since 2003, expanded the ratings database from about 10,000 records to 23,000. I've tried to write a bit about everything I've listened to since 2006, so I have at least 10,000 notes on records ‚Äì some can be called reviews, and some don't quite rise to that level.\\" Christgau, who finds it personally difficult to review jazz in his own writing aesthetic, has since recommended Hull's website for readers seeking advice on jazz albums. In a commentary of Hull's jazz album reviews, Patrick Jarenwattananon of NPR writes: Hull has written for NPR Music and worked with Francis Davis in compiling ballots for the project's annual jazz critics poll. He has also voted in DownBeats annual international critics poll. Information and data from these polls are hosted on his website.  Personal life  Hull has lived in Wichita most of his life, although he has relocated to New Jersey, and then Massachusetts, during his software career. He and Christgau have remained friends since the end of their first professional relationship at The Village Voice, seeing each other often in the ensuing decades. Hull told RockCritics.com in 2014, \\"After my first wife died, I visited my sister-in-law in New York pretty often, and usually I dropped in on Bob and Carola [Dibbell].\\" Christgau introduced Hull to his second wife Laura Tillem, who had been a friend of Christgau's in Boston and worked as an editor. They have been together since 1989.; .

Water is drawn from behind a dam above the Aniwhenua Falls and diverted through a canal and a headpond to the power station before being discharged back into the river. The power station is named after the falls which are adjacent to the power station.  History  = Development = In the late 19th century and early 20th century, numerous small local power generation stations were built by both private and local authorities. From the 1920s onward as the state electricity system expanded and the national grid was developed, development of small local power stations declined as the centralisation of electricity supply under state control increased. The 1973‚Äì74 oil shock, nation-wide electricity shortages during the winters of 1973 and 1974, a renewed policy emphasis on regional development by central government, and increased uncertainty as to future wholesale electricity price trends lead to the New Zealand government to re-evaluate its policy regarding local hydro development. As a result, in 1977 the government announced that they would subsidize local power station schemes of less than 50 MW by providing grants to cover the investigation and design work, cheap loans to finance construction as well as loans from the NZED to cover operating losses in the early years of approved schemes. The government established the Committee on Local Authority Hydro Development (CLAHD) to evaluate applications for grants or loans from supply authorities. Taking up this opportunity the Bay of Plenty Electric Power Board which had begun operations in 1928 and engaged consultants to investigate a local hydro scheme in mid-1973. Preparation of a feasibility report was authorised in December 1973, with the report being completed in September 1974. The study determined that a power station on the Rangitaiki River at its confluence with the Pokairoa Stream, midway between Murupara and Whakatane. The scheme was technically feasible and financially viable. The main identified environmental impacts were significantly reduced flows over the Aniwhenua Falls, inundation of productive farm land and the displacement of one family, as well as the long term accumulation of sediment in the lake that the project would create. The issue of the reduced flow was managed by the imposing of a minimum residual flow over the falls. The estimated cost was NZ$12.5 million. = Construction = Following the obtaining of water rights, government consent and other necessary approval, construction and equipment supply contracts were let in the second half of 1977. The civil works which commenced by the end of 1977 constructed by Downer and Company which involved the excavation of one million tons of material and the placing of 270,000 cubic metres of fill, 20,000 cubic metres of concrete and 884 tonnes of reinforcing steel. = Commissioning = Aniwhenua began generating on 3 October 1980. The 1982 annual report for the board showed that the total cost of the station to 31 March 1982 was $27,767,203 of which $24,628,809 was financed by government loan. The book value of the scheme as at 31 March 1992 was $21,109,000. By the 1985/86 financial year, the scheme was breaking even financially and was able to trade its way into long-run profit without any write-offs of debt. Over the period from 1989 to 1992 as its trading activities were making a loss the profits from Aniwhenua kept the power board in the black. = Service = The Energy Companies Act was enacted in 1992, and amended later that year. This act required the corporatisation of the electricity and gas undertakings of electric power boards and municipalities with the aim of ensuring a commercial and efficient approach to electricity distribution and supply. As a result, the power board was forced in August 1994 to vest all of its assets including Aniwhenua and associated water rights to the Bay of Plenty Electricity Limited. Bay of Plenty Electricity subsequently became the first electricity company to be listed on the New Zealand stock exchange.  Purchase by Nova Energy  In July 1998 the New Zealand Government passed the Electricity Industry Reform Act which was intended to change the structure of the electricity industry to encourage competition. This Act required the operational separation of distribution and generation business activities by 1 July 1999 and separation of the ownership by 1 January 2004. As a result, in 1998 Bay of Plenty Electricity sold its retail and generation business, together with its name to Nova Energy, which was owned by the Todd Corporation. On 1 April 1999, the remaining distribution assets were transferred to a new company, Horizon Energy Distribution Limited (which operates these assets under the name of Horizon Networks).  Leak  After a serious leak developed in the dam during Nova's ownership. Following investigations and development of a solution by consultants Tonkin + Taylor, the contracting firm of Waiotahi Contractors commenced in February 2006 the 58 day repair of the leak which took 58 day at a cost NZ$2.78 million.  Purchase by Southern Generation Partnership  Looking to raise capital to invest in other energy projects in the North Island Nova agreed to sell Aniwhenua in November 2015 to Southern Generation Partnership (a partnership between Pioneer Generation Investments and Roaring Forties) for approximately NZ$100 million with ownership transferring in April 2016. The Roaring Forties is a partnership between The Power Company and Electricity Invercargill. At the beginning of December 2018 Pioneer Energy took over the services agreement with the Southern Generation Partnership to operate and maintain the power station.  Design  Lake Aniwhenua, the lake created by the dam. A 200-metre-long, 10-metre-high dam located upstream of the eight-metre-high Aniwhenua Falls impounds the Rangitaiki River and Pokairoa Stream at their confluence at Black Road, Galatea, approximately 65 km upstream from the river mouth to create Lake Aniwhenua. Smaller dams also divert water from the Pokairoa into Lake Aniwhenua. The lake is 4.5 km long by approximately 500 m wide and is 255 ha in area. The maximum depth of the lake is 10 metres at the dam but it is typically less than three metres deep in other locations. The dam contains two wheeled penstock intake closure gates, two radial spillway gates which can discharge 1,270 cumecs of water. As well there are three additional flap type flood gates designed to handle higher flood conditions. From the dam a 2.2 km long concrete-lined canal conveys water to the Pahekeheke Headpond, which was created by damming the Pahekeheke Stream. From the headpond two penstocks transport the water down to a powerhouse containing two Escher Wyss vertical Francis turbines which are each directly coupled to an ASEA 11 kV 12.5 MW synchronous generator. The station produces on average 127 GWh per annum. The output from the generating units is discharged back to the river just below the falls. The generator size was based on the desire to meet the power board's load factor of 65%. The power station has a head of 38 metres. Compensation water of a 2.5 cumecs is also released from the dam to preserve the original river channel and maintain flow over the falls. A small turbine coupled to a 100 kW generator is driven by the compensation flow and supplies power to the local distribution network via Horizon Energy's Galatea feeder. Compensation water is also released from the headpond through a draw off pipe into the original course of the Pahekeheke Stream. Via two 11/33 kV step-up transformers Aniwhenua is the primary supplier of electricity to Horizon Network's distribution network in the Galatea and Kaingaroa regions via a single 33 kV feeder that runs to Snake Hill and then splits into two feeders to supply Galatea with a further single feeder from Galatea to Kaingaroa. Any surplus above this local demand is exported via a 110 kV circuit to the Matahina Power Station where the two power stations combine to export electricity to the national grid via two 110 kV circuits to Transpower's Edgecumbe Substation.  Operation  For transmission pricing purposes a Prudent Discount Agreement exists for Aniwhenua that makes it part of the Edgecumbe GXP. Aniwhenua is operated to maximise injection into the Horizon network. If there is any generation in excess of local load, this is exported to the national grid. As a result, the power station is effectively embedded. Operation of the power station is covered by the requirements of five resource consents, with the principal consent expiring in September 2026. The lake level operates between a normal operating range of 146.1 to 146.8 metre RL (relative to the Moturiki datum) with the emergency spillway having a level of 148.6 metre RL. The power station operates as a run of river scheme as the lake is small in terms of river flow. Low overnight demand allows refilling of the lake and drawdown to provide increased generation over the daytime peaks. and The power station typically generates at least 8 MW, as below this value it will be necessary to spill water which will impact on the river downstream. There is an ongoing programme to transfer migrating elvers and eels both upstream and downstream from the lake, to maintain eel stocks. = Sedimentation = The headwaters of the Rangitaki River collect lightweight pumice sands and partly greywacke gravels which are deposited in the lake. During its first 15 years of operation the lake accumulated approximately 1.5 million m3 of sediment. Loss of storage has been managed by constructing training banks to encourage the sediment to settle in the deeper areas of the lake as well as lowering of the lake and flushing during floods. In addition, it has been necessary to undertake limited dredging operations to remove sedimentation with 30,000 m3 removed in 2002.

Restoration of Chiang Mai  Kawila was the ruler of Lampang and Chiang Mai, in the northwest portion of Thailand Among the cities under Kawila's rulership was Chiang Mai, which had been largely abandoned during the long-running wars between the Burmese and Siamese armies; nearly twenty years of being on the front lines of the conflict had taken a toll on both the city's population and infrastructure.\\"Monuments, Sites and Cultural Landscape of Chiang Mai, Capital of Lanna\\", UNESCO Kawila entered the city in 1796 with an elaborate ritual, involving entering the city through the Chang Phuek Gate after first sending through a Lau person leading a dog and carrying a rattan pack, then spending the night in front of Wat Chiang Man before entering the palace the next morning. This ritual was a replication of the one followed by King Mangrai, the city's founder, five centuries earlier in 1296. Kawila's rebuilding policy is sometimes translated as \\"Put vegetables into baskets, put people into towns.\\" He sought out the former inhabitants of the city, who had fled to the nearby hills and mountains, and brought them back to the city.Schliesinger, Joachim, \\"Thai Groups of Thailand, Vol. 1\\", pg. 70 When the surviving original inhabitants proved insufficient to repopulate the city, Kawila launched numerous campaigns into neighboring Shan states, capturing their people and resettling them in Chiang Mai.Grabowsky, Volker, \\"Forced Resettlement Campaigns in Northern Thailand During the Early Bangkok Period\\", Journal of the Siam Society 87.1 & 2 (1999) The war captives brought to Chiang Mai included people from the Tai Yai, Tai Yong, Tai Khoen, and Lue ethnicities. He also rebuilt many of the city's fortifications, in case of further war with Burma. As a trusted ally of the new Siamese monarchy, Kawila was largely left to govern his territories as he pleased. He promoted the revival of many traditional Lan Na cultural practices, including music, dance, literature and craftsmanship, as well as distinctive regional Buddhist ceremonies.  Death and succession  Kawila died in 1816 and was succeeded as king of Chiang Mai by his brother Thammalangka. One of Kawila's children, Kawilorot Suriyawong would later reign as king of Chiang Mai.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. Beginning at a knob overlooking New Castle, Virginia, the ridge of Johns Creek Mountain continues southwest for twelve miles undulating between 2900 and 3,000 feet in elevation. Several trails give access to the area. The area is part of the Sinking Creek Valley Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 2 miles southwest of New Castle, Virginia. Cumberland Gap Road, Va 42, is on the southeast side of the area, and Johns Creek Road, Va 658, is on the northwest. Tub Run Road, Forest Road 257, follows along the northwestern border. There are no official trails in the area. The Caldwell Trail is no longer listed in the Forest Service database, however there are many unmaintained trails leading to the ridgeline. Boundary of the Johns Creek Mountain wildarea as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Roads in the area can be found on National Geographic Map 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Johns Creek Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Looney, Potts Creek and Craig Springs. Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. The ridgeline contains white oak, northern red oak, chestnut oak, basswood and hickory with a quality similar to an old-growth forest.. Topography The area is dominated by Johns Creek Mountain, a long ridge, about 2900 feet high, forming the southeastern border of the area. The area drains into Johns Creek which flows north to join Craig Creek near New Castle. Johns Creek is a calm, smooth running stream until it nears New Castle where it plunges through a gorge with class 4-5 rapids, presenting a difficult challenge for paddlers. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provides some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Johns Creek Mountain was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Much of the ridgeline has been assigned ‚ÄúOld Growth with Disturbance‚Äù, the eastern side has an area designated ‚ÄúRuffed Grouse Habitat‚Äù, the western side has a ‚ÄùMix of Successional Habitats‚Äù, there is a ‚ÄúScenic Corridor‚Äù next to Rt 311 and a small tract near New Castle, which may be traded for other lands, is designated ‚ÄúSmall Tract-Custodial‚Äù. A large section of the area has been logged recently, and there is a possibility of future timber sales in the ‚ÄúRuffed Grouse Habitat‚Äù and ‚ÄúMix of Successional Habitats‚Äù areas. There is a network of 5.66 miles of Forest Service logging road not open for public motor use.

Considered the founder of radio electronics in China, he was pivotal in the development of telemetry, tracking and command (TT&C;) systems that control China's satellites and missiles, and in the early development of the BeiDou satellite navigation system. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the International Academy of Astronautics, and was awarded the Two Bombs, One Satellite Meritorious Medal in 1999. The asteroid 10929 Chenfangyun is named after him.  Early life and education  Chen was born on 3 April 1916 in Huangyan, Taizhou, Zhejiang, Republic of China. He graduated from Huangyan County Middle School in 1931 and Shanghai Pudong High School in 1934. He entered Tsinghua University in 1934 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1938. While a student at Tsinghua, he participated in the December 9th Movement of 1935 against Japanese aggression in North China.  Career  During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chen taught and conducted research at Tsinghua University's Radio Research Institute and later worked at the Chengdu Radio Factory. After the end of the war, he went to Britain in 1945 and worked for three years as a researcher at the A.C. Cossor radio factory. Chen returned to China in 1948. He was one of the scientists who established the Institute of Electronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the institute, he developed the world's first measuring device for ultrashort pulse, used to ascertain the level of radiation in nuclear explosions. In 1964, he developed China's first anti-jamming radar for aircraft. In the early 1970s, Chen began researching and developing telemetry, tracking and command (TT&C;) systems that control satellites tens of thousands of kilometers away from earth. The TT&C; system he proposed was crucial in the successful launch of China's first geosynchronous communications satellite in April 1984, and he was conferred the Special Prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award the next year. Based on Chen's pioneering work, a network of TT&C; systems has since been deployed to control China's satellites and missiles. He also put forward theories and proposals leading to the creation and early development of BeiDou, the Chinese satellite navigation system built as an alternative to the American Global Positioning System, and is considered a founder of BeiDou. In March 1986, Chen and three other prominent scientists‚ÄîWang Daheng, Wang Ganchang, and Yang Jiachi‚Äîwrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping advocating the development of strategic technologies. Deng accepted their proposal, which gave birth to the influential 863 Program, named after the date of their letter. Chen died on 29 April 2000, at the age of 84. Honours and recognition Chen was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980. He was also an academician of the International Academy of Astronautics and served as Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation. Chen was awarded the Two Bombs, One Satellite Meritorious Medal in 1999. The asteroid 10929 Chenfangyun, discovered by the Beijing Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program in 1998, is named after him.

History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 340 mod√®le 1893 √† glissement started life as two Canon de 340/35 mod√®le 1893 naval guns as used on the Terrible class of coastal defense ships. The guns converted were made available when the Terrible class were deactivated and scrapped. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period with steel construction consisting of a rifled steel liner with several layers of reinforcing hoops and an interrupted screw breech. To load the gun barrel was lowered and a shell was brought forward by an elevated hoist on the rear of the carriage. The guns consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on two six-axle articulated rail bogies manufactured by Schneider. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. The carriage was similar to that used by the contemporary Canon de 370 mod√®le 75/79 Glissement produced by Schneider. Since the carriage did not have a traversing mechanism it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Six steel beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take the weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. There may have been another two beams located between the triple bogies on each end of the carriage. When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system. World War I From the picture in the infobox at least one of the guns assigned to ALGP.34 (artillerie lourde √† grande puissance) saw action during the German Spring Offensive of 1918 at the Third Battle of the Aisne near Cond√©-sur-Aisne. World War II At the outbreak of the Second World War, the two guns were mobilized and assigned to the 6th battery of Heavy Artillery Regiment 372¬∞ of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e). The two guns of the 6th battery were stationed at an assembly point at Pagny-sur-Moselle when the Battle of France began. The French were only able to evacuate one of the guns to Besan√ßon due to the railroad tracks in the region being destroyed by German bombers. This gun eventually managed to make it to Bayonne via Lyon and Toulouse.

The focal point of the Caballera vs. Caballera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. For the August 2016 Caballera vs. Caballera event IWRG main stay Black Terry and independent circuit wrestler Judas el Traidor both \\"bet\\" their hair on the outcome of the match. Black Terry won the match, two falls to one. forcing Judas el Traidor to have all his hair shaved off in the middle of the ring. In the semi-main event Drag√≥n Fly defeated Hip Hop Man and then challenged him to defend the Catch Argentino International Championship at a later date. The show included three additional matches. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event In the opening match the team of Brazo De Oro Jr. and Fly Tiger defeated Shadow Boy and √öltimo Caballero in a best two-out-of-three falls tag team match.

Sullivan (November 3, 1848 ‚Äì January 31, 1938) was the first chief justice of the Idaho Supreme Court, serving alternately as associate justice from 1891 until 1917. Early life and education Sullivan was born in 1848 in Delaware County, Iowa, to parents Aaron and Jane (Lippincott) Sullivan. He was the fifth child in a family of nine children. He attended public school in Delaware County and later attended Adrian College in Michigan. From age 17 Sullivan taught school in Delaware County, and he was a school principal in Coffeyville, Kansas, 1872‚Äì1873. Family Sullivan married Christine Josephine Moore in 1870, and the marriage produced two sons, Willis Eugene Sullivan and Laverne Latimer Sullivan. Both of the Sullivan brothers graduated from Columbian University and became attorneys, later in practice with their father in the law firm of Sullivan and Sullivan. Career Sullivan read law with Judge J.M. Brayton in Delhi, Iowa, and he was admitted to practice law in Iowa in 1879. He moved to Idaho Territory in 1881, settling in Hailey, a community in the Wood River mining district, opening the firm of Angel & Sullivan. Along with Joseph W. Huston and John T. Morgan, Sullivan won election to the Idaho Supreme Court in 1890, when Idaho became the 43rd state and held its first state election. Sullivan drew a two- year term, and he was appointed the first chief justice of the court. He later won reelection in 1892, 1898, 1904, and 1910. Sullivan retired from the court in 1917, replaced by John Campbell Rice. He later joined his family law practice, Sullivan & Sullivan.

Its type and only known species is R. robustus. Repelinosaurus was originally described as the earliest known kannemeyeriiform dicynodont, supporting the idea of a more rapid radiation of the Triassic kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts during the Early Triassic following the Permian mass extinction. However, it may alternatively be more closely related to the Permian Dicynodon. The discovery of a potential early kannemeyeriiform in an understudied locality like Laos highlights the importance of such places in dicynodont research, which has been largely focused on historically important localities such as the Karoo Basin of South Africa. Description Repelinosaurus was a medium-sized dicynodont (largest skull length of ) currently known only from skulls missing lower jaws and the rest of the skeleton. However, it likely resembled other kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts, and so was probably a heavily built, stocky-limbed quadruped with a short tail and a large head with nearly toothless jaws and a tortoise-like beak, sporting a pair of prominent tusks. =Skull= The skull of Repelinosaurus is relatively narrow for a dicynodont, and the snout in front of the eyes is especially short‚Äîamong the shortest of any dicynodont‚Äîbut proportionately wide, tapering slightly to a flat, squared-off beak. The bony nostrils are large, and occupy half of the length of the short snout. The upper surfaces of the snout are strongly rugose, particularly on the premaxilla, and this textured surface ends abruptly at the contact of the nasal and frontal bones. Like other Kannemeyeriiformes, the nasals sport bony bosses, however uniquely they form as a single central swelling on the snout while most other Kannemeyeriiformes have a distinct pair. This boss stops just above the edge of the nostrils, separated from the frontals by a notch, although the prefrontal bones also sport their own smaller, weakly developed boss. The rough texture of the snout implies it was covered with a layer of horny keratin, like the beak. The maxilla is robust, more so in one specimen than the other, in which the caniniform process housing the tusk is also more strongly developed. The caniniform process is vertical, and so the prominent tusks point directly downwards. The palatine bones are wide at the front and form rough, rugose pads on the roof of the mouth, also likely covered in keratinous horn. The frontals are wide, and so the eyes sit down on the side of the head and face outwards. The postorbital bars closing off the back of the orbits are short, and so the skull (and the temporal fenestra) appear relatively narrow from above for a dicynodont. The pineal foramen (the opening for the \\"third eye\\"), bordered by the preparietal in front and the elongated parietal bones behind, is oval and sits flat on the skull, and noticeably varies in size between the two known specimens (0.96 cm and 1.33 cm in length). The two skulls differ in other ways, some of which appear to be related ontogeny, such as the larger skull being more robust, having a more prominent caniniform process and better developed ornamentation with nasal bosses that extend further out to the sides of the snout. These differences appear to be due to changes in ontogeny or sexual dimorphism, as has been observed in some other dicynodonts, but this cannot be confirmed for Repelinosaurus. History of discovery Both specimens of Repelinosaurus were discovered in the Purple Claystone Formation of the Luang Prabang Basin in northern Laos. This sedimentary unit mostly consists of purple silty-claystones mixed with layers of conglomerates and sandstone, as well as volcaniclastic sediments. Estimated dates for the age of the formation have ranged from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic or even the earliest Jurassic period. More recently, radiometric dating using U‚ÄîPb geochronology from detrital zircon has yielded a maximum age for deposition of 251.0 ¬± 1.4 Ma. However, the mixing and reworking of the sediments implies that the actual depositional age of the formation is probably younger than this, likely placing it in the Early Triassic. However, the reliability of this date was contested by Jun Liu in 2020, who argued that based on biostratigraphy the Purple Claystone Formation should instead be regarded as Late Permian in age, comparing Counillonia to dicynodonts found in the 255-253 million year old Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone of South Africa. Furthermore, Liu argued that the conditions of the Permian mass extinction in equatorial regions between the palaeolatitudes where Laos was situated (such as high temperatures over 40¬∞C) would have been inhospitable for dicynodonts, and concluded that Counillonia instead likely pre-dates the extinction event for these reasons. The first dicynodont remains to be discovered in the Purple Claystone Formation was a single, poorly preserved partial skull discussed by French geologist Jean-Baptiste-Henri Counillon in 1896. This skull was described in 1923 by another French geologist, Joseph R√©pelin, who named it as a new species of Dicynodon, \\"Dicynodon incisivum\\". The incomplete and damaged nature of the skull made identification difficult, and it has been variously attributed to Dicynodon and Lystrosaurus due to a supposed resemblance to the latter. The specimen has since been lost, and the poor quality of the remaining illustrations of the skull are unsuitable for supporting the validity of the species, and \\"D. incisivum\\" has since been considered a nomen dubium. As such, its relationships to other Purple Claystone dicynodonts like Repelinosaurus remain unknown. More dicynodont remains were recovered by a Franco-Laotian expedition between 1993 and 2003 lead by palaeontologist Philippe Taquet. Three skulls in particular were studied and briefly described in 2009 and were assigned to Dicynodon, tentatively as a new species, although this relationship was not tested and remained uncertain. In 2019, the three skulls were more described in full detail and were recognised as representing two distinct new taxa. Two of these skulls, specimens LPB 1993-2 and LPB 1993-9, were assigned to the new genus Repelinosaurus. The third skull was assigned to another new genus, Counillonia. The specimens were temporarily stored, prepared and studied at the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and is permanently housed at the Savannakhet Dinosaur Museum in Laos. The larger of the two specimens, LPB 1993-2, was made the holotype of Repelinosaurus. It is a partial skull missing portions from the left back side including the postorbital bar, the zygomatic arch, the quadratojugals, quadrate bones and part of the squamosal, as well as the external portion of the tusks and the stapes. The palate is also somewhat weathered in this specimen. The referred specimen LPB 1993-9 is smaller than the holotype ( long) and also more complete, however it has been subjected to taphonomic distortion during fossilisation that distorts some features. The skull has been laterally compressed, particularly distorting the shape of the zygomatic arches, obscuring details of the palate, twisting the tusks so that they curl inward, and altering the symmetry of the skull in general (although the left orbit appears to have maintained its shape). LBP 1993-9 is also missing the left quadratojugal and stapes, and the quadrates, while the right stapes and epipterygoids are poorly preserved. The genus was named in honour of the geologist Joseph R√©pelin who described the first remains of Laotian dicynodonts from the Purple Clay Formation (\\"D. incisivum\\"), with the latinised Greek suffix saurus (\\"lizard\\"). The species name is from the Latin robustus, referring to the robust construction of the skull in this species. Classification Preliminary studies of both LPB 1993-2 and LPB 1993-9 found them to be closely comparable to Dicynodon based on comparative anatomy. A phylogenetic analysis was later performed when Repelinosaurus was officially described, utilising the dataset of Angielcyzk & Kammerer (2017), where Repelinosaurus was found to be the basal-most member of Kannemeyeriiformes. Both specimens were included individually to test and re-affirm that they belonged to the same taxon. Repelinosaurus shares three autapomorphies (derived traits) with other Kannemeyeriiformes: the absence of a postfrontal bone, the ventral keels on the anterior pterygoid rami do not converge, and there is no intertuberal ridge on the basioccipital of the braincase. Compared to all other Kannemeyeriiformes, Repelinosaurus can be distinguished by its strongly reduced, short snout, as well as by only having a single median boss and not a pair as with other Kannemeyeriiformes. It also differs in lacking the characteristic temporal crest of many Kannemeyeriiformes, due to its dorsal-facing postorbital bars. A simplified cladogram, an excerpt from the full analysis by Olivier and colleagues focused on the relationships of Kannemeyeriiformes, is shown below: However, an analysis performed in 2020 by Jun Liu found Repelinosaurus to not be a kannemeyeriiform at all, but instead as the sister taxon to the contemporary Laotian dicynodont Counillonia within the \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade of dicynodontoids. This sister relationship is identified by three synapomorphies; a relatively wide median pterygoid plate, distinct contributions of the exoccipital and basioccipital to the occipital condyle at the back of the skull, and the lateral edge of paroccipital process drawn into sharp, posteriorly directed process that is distinctly offset from the surface of the occipital plate. Furthermore, Liu identified a 'core- Dicynodon' clade containing the two Laotian taxa, the Chinese Taoheodon, the Russian genera Delectosaurus and Vivaxosaurus, and Dicynodon itself. A simplified excerpt of the cladogram produced by Liu (2020) is shown below: Palaeoecology In the Purple Clay Formation, Repelinosaurus is currently only known to have co-existed with the \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade dicynodont Counillonia and the semi-aquatic chroniosuchian tetrapod Laosuchus. The only direct evidence of plants in the formation are preserved root traces in palaeosols, but a locality underlying the Purple Claystone Formation and above late Changhsingian (Late Permian) deposits preserves a rich and diverse palaeoflora. The sediments preserved indicate that the Purple Clay Formation was deposited in a braided river environment that gradually transitioned to an alluvial plain with ponds. The region was volcanically active, as evidenced by the volcaniclastic rocks mixed in with the sediments of the formation. This appears to be associated with a volcanic arc that was formed as the then isolated Indochina Block where Laos was located approached the rest of the supercontinent Pangaea. Life restoration of the contemporary chroniosuchian Laosuchus. =Palaeobiogeography= The presence of typical Permian fauna, including dicynodonts like Repelinosaurus, at a time close to the Permian mass extinction may suggest that the Indochina Block, including the Laos region, may have acted as a refugium for Permian life across the Permo-Triassic boundary (similarly, plant diversities in nearby South China appear to have been relatively stable across the Permo-Triassic boundary). Alternatively, if Repelinosaurus is Late Permian in age, its presence in Laos would indicate that the Indochina Block was connected to the Southern and Northern China Blocks by this time. This is in contrast with previously inferred dates suggesting that these landmasses did not collide and connect with each other until the Triassic period. Repelinosaurus may represent one of the oldest known kannemeyeriiforms and would extend their range almost to the Permo- Triassic boundary itself. Kannemeyeriiforms were previously thought have to have only diversified by the Middle Triassic, however the discovery of Sungeodon from the Early Triassic of China suggested they were already radiating before then. The discovery of Repelinosaurus may support this, and could indicate that Kannemeyeriformes experienced a rapid post-extinction recovery almost immediately after the Permo-Triassic extinction. Furthermore, the presence of both Repelinosaurus and Sungeodon in Southeast Asia in the Early Triassic would strengthen suggestions that key parts of dicynodont evolution, namely the early evolution of the Kannemeyeriiformes, has been hindered by geographic sampling biases. Such biases have focused on well- studied historical sites, such as the Karoo Basin in South Africa, which despite heavily sampling have not recovered similar fossils. Events such as these may have taken place outside of such localities, as perhaps evidenced by the discovery of Repelinosaurus, a basal kannemeyeriiform, in Early Triassic Southeast Asia.

It is situated north of Marblemount, within North Cascades National Park. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Blum, to the north, with Bacon Peak to the south. Precipitation runoff and glacier meltwater from the large Hagan Glacier and smaller Hidden Creek Glacier on the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Hagan Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Northern Pickets, Mount Blum, and Hagan (right) from the upper meadow below Park Butte The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

One day, when the Austrian artist, Peter Fendi, was travelling through the area, he discovered young Albrecht's drawing talents and persuaded his family to allow him to take the boy to Vienna with him. Fendi was unable to have children of his own, due to a childhood injury, and lived with his mother. In addition to private lessons from Fendi, in 1827 he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. He effectively became a member of the Fendi family, joining two adopted nieces in their small apartment.

He was one of the first French punchcutters to produce Roman type, at a time where other French printers were mostly using blackletter. He worked for Robert Estienne, who was one of the earliest Parisian printers to print Roman type, in the style of Aldus Manutius. He was a contemporary of other eminent French printers, such as Simon de Colines and Geoffroy Tory, while Claude Garamond, whose roman type became the most influential in Europe, apprenticed with him around the year 1510.  Biography  His print-shop located on Rue Saint-Jacques, was only in businesses for three years, between 1532 and 1534. In 1533 he published anonymously Marguerite de Navarre's Miroir de l'√¢me p√©cheresse (The Mirror of the Sinful Soul), a mystic poem that was condemned by the Sorbonne's Faculty of Theology and forwarded to the Parliament for censorship. Under pressure from King Francis I, Marguerite's brother, the Sorbonne retracted their condemnation of Miroir, claiming their scrutiny was only due to the anonymous nature of the printing. This emboldened Augereau, who published two more editions of the poem that same year, with the identity of the author clearly stated. Each successive edition contained more and more evangelical content, with the third edition also containing a verse translation of Psalm 6 by Calvinist poet Cl√©ment Marot, at a time when ecclesiastic authorities opposed any translation of the Bible in French. Already arrested and released in 1533 on suspicion of heresy because of his pro-evangelical publications, Augereau was among the first to be arrested in December 1534 as part of the anti-Protestant backlash that followed the Affair of the Placards. On 24 December 1534 he was executed for heresy and printing anti-Catholic material.

Greek authorities indicted Soulakiotis in February 1951 on charges including homicide, fraud, forgery of wills, blackmail and torture. Sentenced to life in 1952, Soulakiotis died in in 1954. Soulakiotis was alleged to have committed her crimes in the Peukovounogiatrissas Monastery () near Keratea, Greece. As of 2008, the monastery remains open and still has members who believe she was innocent and venerate her as a saint. Religious life Soulakiotis was an avid Old Calendarist and a follower of the Matthewite sect, which the mainstream Greek Orthodox Church considers to be in schism. She, together with Archbishop and hieromonk Matthew (Karpathakis) of Besthena, founded the monastery in 1927. After the death of Abp. Matthew, Soulakiotis succeeded him as abbot. Crime Soulakiotis' alleged modus operandi was to encourage wealthy women to join the convent, and then torture them until they donated their fortunes to the monastery; once the money was donated, Soulakiotis would embezzle it and in some cases kill the donor. Reuters reported that at the time of her arrest she had amassed three hundred properties across Greece this way along with \\"gold and jewels worth thousands of pounds.\\" Soulakiotis also demanded strict adherence to ascetic practices among those in the convent, which police alleged led to the unnecessary deaths of 150 children from tuberculosis. Victims of Soulakiotis' administration of the monastery also variously accuse her of torturing them, starving them, falsely imprisoning them, and beating them. Soulakiotis denied all the charges against her until she died, terming them (\\"Satanic fictions\\"). The number of Soulakiotis' victims is a matter of some debate; the most commonly cited figure of 27 murders and 150 negligent homicides comes from medical testimony during her trial.

His style is related to that of Jaume Huguet and his works have sometimes been confused with that painter's youthful efforts.  Life and work  He appears to have begun his artistic education in the workshop of his uncle, Blasco de Gra√±√©n, who also worked as his agent. In 1457, he and Juan Rius (fl.1455-1482) were commissioned to create an altarpiece for the town of Aguil√≥n, with his uncle as guarantor. In 1459, following his uncle's death, he completed altarpieces at √âpila and Ejea de los Caballeros that his uncle had left unfinished. At the latter, in the Iglesia de San Salvador, which was not completed until 1476, a cleaning that was performed in 1986 uncovered evidence that the work may be entirely Soria's. Also in 1459, he contracted with the merchant, Miguel de Baltue√±a, to create an altarpiece for his personal chapel at the Iglesia de San Pablo in Zaragoza. Some of the panels, damaged by old, inexpert restorations are at the Zaragoza Museum. Between 1469 and 1471 he produced a \\"Virgen del Campo\\" in As√≠n which was once attributed to Huguet. It is not until 1485 that another work can be named as his with certainty. This is the main altarpiece of the church in , Huesca, which was signed and dated. Most of the panels were destroyed in 1936, during the Spanish Civil War. The surviving ones may be seen at the local . The others are known only through photographs.

Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Tupolev Tu-104B, registration CCCP-42492. Synopsis The plane took off from Beijing around 2:49am Moscow time en route to Irkutsk at 9,000 meters. With low cloud cover over the Irkutsk airport, the crew received contradictory weather data about the low height of the cloud tops. The plane ended up descending too early. Upon exiting the cloud cover less than 60 meters from the ground, the pilots attempted to take evasive action but could not and the plane impacted terrain two miles short of the runway around 10am local time. Casualties 33 of the 35 people on board died in the crash, including all eight crew members and 25 passengers. Two passengers survived. Among the dead were seven Albanians including the Albanian ambassador to China and poet Drago Siliqi, as well as three Chinese.

Diagram showing working principle of CSS It is a type of physical vapor deposition where the substrate to be coated and the source material are held close to one another. They are both placed in a vacuum chamber, which is pumped down. The source and substrate are then heated. The source is heated to some fraction of its melting temperature, and the substrate some lower temperature e.g. 750 ¬∞C and 550 ¬∞C, respectively. This causes sublimation of the source, allowing vapors to travel a short distance to the substrate, where they condense, producing a thin film. This short-path diffusion is similar in principle to short-path distillation. Compared to other techniques, it is a relevantly insensitive process, and takes as little as 10 min for an entire cycle.

By ruling that the guideline interfered with the status of a superintendent as a persona designata, the Court provided an important finding in establishing the limits of discretionary powers under the Irish constitution and the legal standing of guidelines issued under the auspices of a national body.  Background  The possession and use of firearms is regulated by a number of statutes, namely the Firearms Acts of 1925 and 1964. The 1925 Act prohibits the possession or use of firearms except where a certificate granted under the provisions of the Act by the Superintendent of An Garda Siochana of the district in which that person resides. This case regards a directive entitled \\"Security Arrangements for Licensed Firearms\\" (Directive 53/00) issued by the second named respondent, an assistant commissioner of An Garda Siochana. This directive required certain security requirements to be in place before certificates were issued; in particular, when the firearm is not in use, it must be kept in a properly constructed firearms cabinet, for which the key must be separately stored.  Facts of the case  The applicants were involved in a voluntary organization involved in, inter alia, game shooting. The applicants challenged the legal validity of the requirements, as established in Directive 53/00, following the first respondent being refused a firearms certificate.  Lower courts  The applicants were granted leave by the High Court to institute proceedings by way of judicial review. O Caoimh J held that the applicants were entitled to orders of certiorari and therefore, quashing Directive 53/00 and the refusal to grant a firearm certification to the first applicant. The High Court granted the reliefs sought based on two grounds: > \\"1. The directive was void.. as it had the effect of fettering the > discretion of a superintendent in the exercise of the relevant functions > under the 1925 Act; 2\\\\. That a superintendent was no empowered to impose a > fixed precondition requiring every applicant for a firearm certificate to > keep the firearms in a locked firearms cabinet constructed in accordance > with the requirements of the directive.\\" The respondents appealed the Supreme Court.  Appellant's arguments  The appellants submitted that the control of firearms was a policing matter and due to the fact that statute regulated such power, did not make their control any less. The appellants also argued that because a licensing function had been conferred on Garda Superintendents, as persona designata, that power could be exercised at absolute discretion. It was also submitted that the Firearms Acts had the intention of local level senior officers granting firearm certificates. Finally, it was submitted that; it was not logical that the Oireachtas would remove, from the Commissioner, any power to ensure minimum acceptable standards of public safety; such a structure would be inconsistent with the purpose of the police force.  Opinion of the Supreme Court  Ultimately, the court held that Directive 53/00 interfered with the persona designata status of the Garda Superintendent, which couldn't be inferred on another. Furthermore, it was held that the Superintendent, in imposing such a condition was acting ultra vires, as there was no requirement for secure storage in the legislation. Keane CJ, in his judgement, held that the High Court was correct in holding that Superintendent's power, as conferred on them by section 2 of the 1925 Act, was, in fact, granted to the Superintendent as a persona designata, and therefore, such power could not be abdicated to anyone else. Furthermore, he may not be required to exercise it by another body or authority. This decision was supported by the cases of McLoughlinMcLoughlin v Minister for Social Welfare [1955] IR 1 and Rajan.State (Rajan) v The Minister for Industry and Commerce and Others [1988] ILRM 231 Since the Supreme Court was satisfied that the High Court judge had not erred in law in the first ground, it was not necessary to investigate the second. Nevertheless, the court stated that such an act, as set out as the second ground, would constitute the Garda Superintendent, acting ultra vires of the provisions of the 1925 and 1964 Firearm Acts. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the order of the High Court.  Subsequent developments  In McCarron v Superintendent Kearney, [2008] IEHC 195, Charleton J., commented that Dunne made the task of \\"reasonable administration\\" more difficult for the Garda Siochana.

He is known for his historical illustrations and drawings of early Texas, specifically of horsemen including charro, vaquero, Texas rangers, and Texas cowboys. He illustrated over 300 books.  Early life and education  Cisneros was born on 18 April 1910 in Villa Ocampo, Durango, Mexico to parents Fernando Cisneros and Juanita (n√©e Barrag√°n) Cisneros. His father was a carpenter by trade, but worked various other jobs to support the family. The Cisneros family had to run away from Mexico by late 1917 due to the dangers of the Mexican Revolution, their village and family home were destroyed. The family eventually migrated to Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, Mexico, and Cisneros was allowed to study English in nearby El Paso, Texas at the Lydia Patterson Institute. In 1927 at the age of 17, he dropped out of school in order to help support the family with various odd jobs and it was during this time he creating artwork from discarded commercial signs. By 1930, his art and writing was published in magazines from Mexico including Revista de Revistas, Vida Mexicana, Todo, El Le√≥n Juarense, and others. In Juarez, he joined an artists and writers club, El Ateneo Fronterizo (The Border Athenaeum).  Career  Cisneros saw an established artist, Tom Lea painting a mural on the El Paso Federal Courthouse, Cisneros introduced himself and shared his drawings. It was through his relationship with Lea, Cisneros was able to connect with J. Carl Hertzog (1902-1984), a printer and publisher that hired Cisneros for illustration work. Through his collaborations with Hertzog included illustration of books, book plates, greeting cards, calendars, programs and newspapers and more. And many of the book illustrations were for various 1940s history books, which required researching for the accuracy of the image. Cisneros designed the coat of arms for the city of Juarez. He also designed the seal for Texas Western College, and this seal was used and updated when educational organization became University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In 2018, Cisneros's work was included in the El Paso Museum of Art group exhibition, Early West Texas: Waypoint and Home, alongside artists Manuel Gregorio Acosta and Tom Lea.  Personal life  Cisneros married Vicenta Madera of Juarez in 1939, and together they had five daughters. In 1948, he became a US citizen through naturalization. He was a devout Catholic and would often go to services daily at St. Joseph‚Äôs Catholic Church in El Paso, up until his death.

In 1958, Poynter was a key player in founding the Faculty of the History of Medicine and Pharmacy of the Society of Apothecaries and subsequently in 1965, he was one of the founding committee members who established the British Society for the History of Medicine (BSHM). He became its president in 1972 and also became secretary- general of the Soci√©t√© Internationale d‚ÄôHistoire de la M√©decine, later becoming its president too. He published a number of works related to the history of medicine and also edited Medical History, the first British journal devoted exclusively to the history of medicine. During his directorship of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, his advice was readily sought on matters pertaining to the history of medicine and on organisations. His influence was particularly felt with the Bibliographical Society and he was invited to give a number of eponymous lectures. The biennial Poynter lecture is named in his honour. Early life and career Frederick Poynter, commonly known as No√´l, was born in London on 24 December 1908, to Herbert William Poynter, who worked in the London docks, and his wife, Margaret (n√©e Gurry). The family were Roman Catholic and he was the seventh of nine children. He was educated at West Ham secondary school, before studying history at King's College London. In 1930, following a brief time teaching in a preparatory school, he became a junior library assistant and was involved in the last stages of Sir Henry Wellcome's collections, at a time when the library was situated in the cramped conditions of the former wireless factory near Willesden Junction, north west London. At the time, the librarian was Samuel Arthur Joseph Moorat. Poynter completed his diploma in librarianship in 1936 at the University of London and his bachelor's degree in 1938, when he was promoted to sub-librarian. Second World War Poynter was influenced by the historian Max Neuburger, who joined the Wellcome staff after fleeing Nazi occupied Europe. When library space was allocated at the Wellcome building in Euston Road in 1941, it was Poynter that was appointed to organise the transfer of the books. This was interrupted when he was posted to the Royal Air Force educational branch, but by becoming a fellow of the Library Association, he was able to complete his professional qualifications in 1942. He was demobilised in 1946. The Wellcome Library Pages from Poynter's A Catalogue of Incunabula (1954) Poynter, Gaskell and Walkins in library reading room On his return to the library, he was promoted to deputy librarian and formed a successful partnership with W. J. Bishop, who succeeded Moorat. The Wellcome Library officially opened in 1949 and with Bishop he encouraged the development of its services and raised its profile via the medical section of the Library Association. Together, they worked on research and bibliography, and in 1953, they also led the organisation of the first International Congress on Medical Librarianship. Its proceedings, edited by Poynter, were published in 1954. When Bishop resigned in 1953, due to frustrations with the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and its director, Edgar Ashworth Underwood, Poynter took over as librarian and began in this role with the publication of the quarterly Current Work in the History of Medicine, followed by a catalogue of the library's incunabula. In 1956, Poynter gained a PhD from Westfield College for his work on Gervase Markham. This bibliography was published in 1963. Medical societies In 1958, Poynter was a key player in founding the Faculty of the History of Medicine and Pharmacy of the Society of Apothecaries, serving first as its secretary and editor of its proceedings, and then as its chairman in 1970. Its success led to the foundation of the BSHM in 1965, when he was one of its founding committee members along with William Copeman, Haldane Philp Tait, K. D. Keele, D. Geraint James, Douglas Guthrie, E. S. Clarke and Charles Newman. Between 1965 and 1967, he was president of the Osler Club of London. He became president of the BSHM in 1972. Poynter was also active in the reorganisation of the Soci√©t√© Internationale d‚ÄôHistoire de la M√©decine, becoming its Secretary-General. He subsequently became the president of the International Academy of the History of Medicine. Journals Following Bishop's death in 1961, Poynter succeeded him as editor of the first exclusive British journal to the history of medicine, Medical History, a journal he founded and then edited between 1957 and 1973. He was appointed to the editorial board of the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, with the assistance of his American colleagues. Director of the Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine  Edwin Clarke and Noel Poynter. Wellcome In 1964, Poynter was appointed Director of the Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine, a position he held until 1973, after which he was succeeded by E. S. Clarke. During his directorship, he became influential, particularly with the Bibliographical Society. His writing activities earned him a Doctorate of Literature. His advice was frequently sought on a variety of topics including organisational and academic themes. He gave a number of lectures, including the Gideon De laune Lecture to the Society of Apothecaries (1964) and the Vicary Lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons (1973). Personal life In 1939, Poynter married sculptor Ruth Marder. They had no children. She died in 1966 and he remarried two years later, to Dodie. He retired to France in 1973. Death and legacy Poynter died on 11 March 1979 at Brive in France, following a short illness. The BSHM biennial Poynter lecture is named in his honour.

In American Fix, Hampton writes with candor about his experiences with what he calls a broken treatment system and outlines a political agenda for combatting the nation's addiction crisis. Hampton is a frequent contributor to The Huffington Post. Political activism Hampton has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump's border wall, arguing that Trump's immigration agenda is shifting focus backwards to a \\"War on Drugs\\" approach. He has advocated for safer recovery housing for addicts and for standards to end rogue sober homes in America. In August 2018, Hampton led a 500-person protest against drugmaker Purdue Pharma for their role in the American opioid crisis. He has been at the forefront in calling for accountability from drug makers. In January 2019, Hampton was the guest of U.S. House Democrats to President Trump's State of the Union speech, representing the addiction recovery advocacy movement.

It is dated to about 11,500 BP. It is believed that there was human presence at the site at that time. Discovery The specimen was discovered on 12 December 1989 by a Flower Excavating Company drag line operator who was digging a new pond on the Burning Tree Golf Course grounds. The drag line‚Äôs shovel caught and damaged the skull. In the following three days, the fossil was excavated during relatively bitter winter cold and blowing winds. Excavation was conducted by the Ohio Historical Society and the Licking County Archaeology & Landmarks Society and volunteers from several organizations. =Locality= The locality was the grounds of the Burning Tree Golf Course, southern side of Ridgley Tract Road, just west of Lake Drive, south side of Heath, southern Licking County, central Ohio, USA. The American mastodon The American mastodon is an extinct species of proboscidean mammal, Mammut americanum (Kerr, 1792) (Animalia, Chordata, Vertebrata, Mammalia, Proboscidea, Mammutidae). The only living proboscideans are the African elephants (Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Mammut americanum had a widespread distribution during the Pleistocene. Its fossil remains are found from Alaska to Florida, but are most commonly encountered in eastern America. Average statistics reported for the American mastodon are: ~15 feet long, 9-10 feet tall at the shoulder, ~8,000-10,000 pounds. During life, mastodons were covered with coarse, brownish hair, unlike modern elephants. Thick body hair on Pleistocene proboscideans was an evolutionary adaptation to harsh wintery climates. Remains of >150 mastodons have been reported in Ohio, but only about a dozen or so are semi-complete. The Burning Tree Mastodon is a ~30 year old male and is 90-95% complete, missing only the right rear leg, a few tail bones, two ribs, and all the toe bones. The lower spine and right rib cage have healed injuries which have been interpreted as the result of battles with other mastodons. Preserved stomach contents and intestinal contents were also recovered. Human presence Burning Tree Mastodon Exhibit at the Akron Fossils & Science Center Cut marks on some of the ribs indicate that this individual was butchered by early humans. Nevertheless, stone tools were not discovered in the area. Dating Isotopic dating of wood closely associated with the skeleton gives dates of 11,450 to 11,660 years. Isotopic dating of actual bone material gives an 11,390 year date (during the Wisconsinan Glacial Interval of the near-latest Pleistocene). Diet In addition to being near- complete, the Burning Tree Mastodon is remarkable in other ways. Preserved gut contents indicated a diet of moss, seeds, leaves, water lilies, and swamp grass. Before this discovery, American mastodons were interpreted as having diets consisting principally of twigs & cones from evergreen trees. =Bacteria= Additionally, 38 species of still-living gut bacteria were isolated from preserved intestinal contents.Bacteria from Burning Tree mastodon survived 13,000 years. Columbus Dispatch, Apr 28, 2016 These ancient bacteria were, for a while, considered the oldest known living organisms anywhere on Earth. However, still-living gut bacteria have been isolated from insects in early Cenozoic amber and viable halobacteria have been recovered from Paleozoic and even late Precambrian rock salt. The original Burning Tree Mastodon skeleton was sold in 1993 for over US$600,000 and now resides in a museum in Japan. Notes Literature Primary: *Fisher, D.C., B.T. Lepper & P.E. Hooge. 1991.

Commissioned to promote the General Post Office, it is Lye's first direct animation to receive a public release. Production In mid 1935, Lye struck a deal with John Grierson to make a direct animation for the GPO Film Unit. Lye was paid ¬£30, with his materials paid for by the GPO. Lye and sound editor Jack Ellitt went through hundreds of records looking for music to use as the soundtrack. They selected a beguine called \\"The Belle Creole\\" by Don Barreto and his Cuban Orchestra. After the music was transferred to film, Lye made cue marks on the sound track, which he used as a guide as he painted on the image track. Lye painted long, continuous patterns on the 35 mm film stock, without frame lines to separate individual film frames and with few splices used. He used combs or sticks to create linear patterns on the film stock. It took him five days to finish most of the film. Before settling on the title A Colour Box, Lye used the titles Cheaper Parcel Post and La Belle Creole. Release A Colour Box was first shown to critics and journalists on 6 September 1935. Cinema owners were hesitant to screen the work because of its experimental approach and promotional nature. The Granada Theatre and the Tatler Cinema were among the first to screen it. The film had its international premiere in October 1935 at the International Cinema Festival in Brussels. The jury created a special \\"fantasy film\\" category so that they could award A Colour Box with a Medal of Honour. The film was later screened at the 1936 Venice Film Festival, where Nazi viewers labeled it degenerate art and protested the film. They stomped their feet loudly, leading to the three-minute film being stopped before its completion. Reception Contemporary reactions to A Colour Box were polarised. Many critics recognised its originality but viewed it as little more than a novelty. Robert Herring called it \\"the first ballet in film\\". One review in Sight & Sound said that Lye had \\"stirred the abstract film to a new vitality.\\" Canadian animator Norman McLaren carefully studied the film, inspired by Lye's \\"technical inventiveness\\". It became a major influence on his own direct filmmaking practice.

TOC Life Rook was born in Faversham, Kent, as the son of bookseller and postmaster Henry John Rook. Rook studied at Oriel College, Oxford, from 1881 to 1886. He was in Bristol as a civil service examination tutor in 1891. He married Clara Wright in September 1893. The marriage certificate gives his profession as journalist. He became a fairly successful London journalist in the 1890s, writing for The Globe with E. V. Lucas, contributing to the \\"By the Way\\" column, The Daily Chronicle with Henry Nevinson, where he founded the \\"Office Window\\" column, The Illustrated London News, The Idler, The Ludgate Monthly, The Art Journal. He became known in London's literary circles and was strongly praised by George Bernard Shaw.Introduction to The Stir Outside The Caf√© Royal by Otto Penzler, The Big Book of Female Detectives (2018). He was befriended by Louis Frederic Austin, and was a member of the Argonaut's Club, a literary society whose other members included Rudolph Lehman, Florence Marryat, Bernard Partridge, John Alfred Spender, George Paston and William Henry Wilkins.Oxford Sociology, 28 October 2013. He rose to fame with his novel on working-class life in the East End of London, The Night of the Hooligan, published in 1899. The book purports to be a factual report on the London underworld, but contemporary reviewers were skeptical. Rook claims that the protagonist, named Alf, was introduced to him by publisher Grant Richards. Richards's autobiographical notes seem to confirm this, but it is possible that Richards was writing to perpetuate the literary fiction of Rook. Green (1979) in the introduction to the OUP edition, in any case, points out some possible fictional sources for episodes in the book. Rook also placed some of the characters of The Hooligan Nights in a clearly fictional story called \\"The Stakes\\" published in Paul Mall Magazine in 1900. Rook also wrote a detective- story, The Stir Outside The Caf√© Royal, published in the September 1898 edition of The Harmsworth Magazine. He visited St Louis in 1904, a trip he wrote about in a piece with the title \\"American Manners\\" in 1906. He visited Gran Canaria in 1909. His 1907 book on Switzerland is a serious study of the Swiss national character and republican institutions.Chatto & Windus, Notes and Queries, 2 February 1907. Rook retired from writing early and unexpectedly. Green (1915) suggests that he had disappeared suddenly and without leaving a trace,\\"Few authors of the period can have vanished as effectively as Rook\\" Green (1979) and indeed Rook's early retirement and death and his comparatively small body of work has left him far more obscure than his contemporaries of the literary establishment of Edwardian London such as George Gissing, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Morrison or Walter Besant. Rook died after prolongued illness in December 1915. His death certificate suggests that he had suffered from locomotor ataxia, a symptom of advanced stage syphilis, for the last 26 years.Green (1979) He left his wife the sum of GBP 1300 (about GBP 130,000 in 2019 moneyUK Inflation Calculator).

Career  Born in Kleve, Thiele was the daughter of Otto Thiele and his wife Maria, who had six daughters and a son. The family moved to D√ºsseldorf-Oberkassel shortly after her birth. When she was aged 15, her father sent her to the Hochschule f√ºr B√ºhnenkunst of the D√ºsseldorfer Schauspielhaus, run by Louise Dumont and . She appeared on stage the same year, for example with Gustaf Gr√ºndgens, another student, at the garden restaurant Vossen Links in Oberkassel and on the D√ºsseldorf stage as a fairy in Shakespeare's Ein Sommernachtstraum. She made her official debut on 8 June 1920 as Wendla Bergmann in Wedekind's Fr√ºhlings Erwachen. Melchior Lengyel in the Raimundtheater (1925) When the D√ºsseldorfer Schauspielhaus was closed in 1922, Thiele accepted a contract with the Deutsches Volkstheater in Vienna, together with her colleague Eugen Dumont who was 27 years older. Her parents opposed it, and the couple therefore got married. During her time in Vienna, Thiele pursued dancing at the school of Rudolf von Laban. She was particularly successful as Anitra in Ibsens's Peer Gynt, also dancing. She held dance performances. Max Brod wrote in a review that scenes of gymnastics and dance were added for her, and noted that her well-trained body appeared ingenious and never boring even without dialogue (\\"Dieser durchtrainierte K√∂rper wirkt auch ohne Dialog geistreich und nie langweilig.\\") In 1926, Thiele divorced Dumont and moved to the Theater des Westens in Berlin, where she appeared alongside Willy Fritsch and Willi Forst. In 1929, she played for six months in Prague, where she was a celebrated favourite with the audience (\\"gefeierter Liebling des Prager Publikums\\"). A year later, she married Karl Levinger, an entrepreneur from Ulm. She returned to the D√ºsseldorfer Schauspielhaus three years later. Under the Nazi regime, Thiele and her husband moved to Alcal√° de Henares near Madrid in 1935 where they ran a chicken farm. During the Spanish Civil War, the farm was confiscated and her husband arrested. Thiele escaped to Marseille and further to Vienna, where she was housed by Fritz Wotruba. Her daughter Lydia was born there in 1937. Her husband was free after five months and followed her. When the Gestapo searched for him in 1938, they moved back to Spain. Levinger was traumatised and planned to emigrate to Chile or the United States. When Thiele objected, she was sent to an asylum (Irrenanstalt). She escaped after four weeks. With the help of friends, she managed a new existence as a teacher of dance and gymnastics. She was a choreographer for the Teatro Mar√≠a Guerrero. Karl Levinger took his life in 1946. Thiele formed her own successful dance company. She had to give up dancing because of a knee injury and appeared as an actress again. Thiele moved back to D√ºsseldorf but accepted no acting contracts, although Gr√ºndgens, now Intendant of the D√ºsseldorfer Schauspielhaus, asked her to become a member of the ensemble. She began writing and became a member of the in 1985. She published her memoirs, Und mir wuchsen Fl√ºgel, in 1994. She died in D√ºsseldorf.

The stems are erect, dull green, (1.5‚Äì2‚Äì5 m tall and 4‚Äì10 mm in diameter, cataphylls are to 40 cm or more long. The inflorescence is large and drooping, with many flowers scattered along fine branchlets. Flowers occur mostly October-January, seeds are shed mostly December-April. Juncus ingens was first described by Norman Wakefield in 1957. Juncus ingens is native to the floodplains of southeastern Australia, occurring mainly in Victoria, forming dense stands on the margins of seasonal wetlands. Giant rush is rarely grazed by introduced herbivores such as cattle or horses, or by native herbivores such as kangaroos, and is also resistant to fire. Although native to Australia, Juncus ingens is considered an invasive species in some areas such as Barmah National Park. The spread of J. ingens into areas where it historically did not occur is a result of changes to flooding regimes in the now highly regulated Murray-Darling Basin. Specifically, reduced winter flooding levels and extended flooding into summer months promotes the spread of J. ingens. Conversely, increasing winter and spring flood depth and duration, and reduction of unseasonal flooding limits the growth and spread of J. ingens, allowing recolonisation of displaced species such as Moira grass (Pseudoraphis spinescens). > :Water regime for vigorous growth ::Maintenance: :::Frequency of flooding: > Annual to nearly annual. :::Depth of flooding: Shallow, 5 to 50 cm; can > tolerate up to 1 m. :::Duration of flooding: Eight to 10 months :::Timing of > flooding: At least spring to early autumn. ::Regeneration: Germination > occurs on moist soil, bare of plants, such as on flood recession or wetland > drawdown, in late autumn and winter. :::Seedling establishment: > Establishment is increased by shallow flooding, to 20 cm, in spring‚Äìearly > summer; and by avoiding stresses such as overtopping or droughting in the > first two years. ::Critical flood interval: Not certain.

Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy title was Nagato-no-kami (later Kura-no-kami), and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. Biography Hori Naotora was born in Edo as the 6th son of Hori Naotada, the 11th daimy≈ç of Suzaka Domain. In 1868, on the suicide of his elder brother Hori Naotora, he became daimy≈ç of Suzaka. Immediately on assuming office, he completely reversed the politics of his brother and declared the domain for the Meiji government and dispatched troops to fight against the pro-Tokugawa forces in the Boshin War. Samurai from the domain were active at the Battle of Utsunomiya, Battle of Hokuetsu and Battle of Aizu. Many of the undecided minor daimy≈ç of Shinano were thus convinced to join the new government, which then awarded Suzaka Domain with a bonus of 5000 koku. In June 1869 he was proclaimed imperial governor of Suzaka and in July 1871, with the abolition of the han system, he surrendered his offices and relocated to Tokyo. On February 13, 1877, he officially changed his surname to \\"Okuda\\". In 1884, he was elevated to the title of viscount (shishaku) under the new kazoku peerage system.

They were running an East- West caravan trade, exchanging cloths from the Swahili coast for ivory and slaves. They introduced the Muslim faith and culture in the Nkhotakota area and were the first to grow rice and coconuts in the region.  History  The founder of the dynasty, Salim bin Abdallah, arrived at Nkhotakota around 1840. He was an Arab from Zanzibar and had previously been involved in slave and ivory trade at Ujiji and Tabora in nowadays Tanzania. He asked the local Chewa chiefs for some land to establish a trading post. He was able to build his power by building dhows that enabled merchants to trade goods across the lake and because he possessed firearms with which he could protect the lake populations against the Ngoni invasions. The Jumbes brought some 20000 slaves yearly to the port of Kilwa in nowadays Tanzania. The captives were kept in Nkhotakota until there was 1000 of them. They were then shipped across Lake Malawi and forced to walk for three to four month till they arrived to the Kilwa slave market where they were sold. The Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone witnessed this slave trade when he visited Nkhotakota in 1861. In 1864, he established a treaty with the Jumbe and the Chew chiefs to put an end to the slave trade. However, it was to no avail and the trade continued. The Jumbes also engaged in ivory trade. They employed local hunters to collect ivory from the hills west of Nkhotakota. By 1889, the slave trade had faded and the Jumbe derived most of his revenue from the ivory trade. His hunters radiated in every direction from central Malawi. As the Jumbe chiefdom was on the same ivory trade route than the Mwase chiefdom, there was significant infighting between both. He won a large personal following that he established in villages ruled by his headmen. He insisted that his followers, mainly Yao traders and Chewa refugees, convert to Islam. Ultimately, Salim bin Abdallah set himself as Sultan of Marimba expressing his allegiance for the Sultan of Zanzibar. The Jumbes (meaning \\"Prince\\") established their power though indirect rule, relying on the authority of local Chewa chiefs. They did not attempt to convert theirs subjects. However, to promote the chiefs loyalty, they encouraged them to send their male offspring to the Sultanate of Zanzibar so that they would receive an Islamic education. At the end of the 19th century, Nkhotakota had become a thriving trade center of 6000 inhabitants. It was the main Islamic outpost in Nyassaland, rice cultivation had been extended along the lake shore. The power of the Jumbes remained unchallenged until Henry Hamilton Johnston asserted the authority of the British Central Africa Protectorate in this area. He undertook significant efforts to put an end to the slave trade. He attacked the last Jumbe with a Sikh force in 1894 was tried and exiled to Zanzibar.  Landmarks  Some heritage sites of the Jumbes of Nkhotakota can bee seen in Malawi. They include the first mosque built in the country, the graves of the three first Jumbes as well as their lieutenants' graves. The fig trees under which the Jumbe and Livingstone met and agreed to discontinue the slave trade can still be seen.

One of the oldest breweries in the country, it was founded in 1497 and since then has produced beer with a production process that includes manufacturing its own malt. As of 2017, the brewery produces 17 beers and is the only company in Ukraine with a license for whiskey production. Mikulinetsky Brovar has affiliation with Konig Ludwig in Germany, for whom it brews and bottles Kaltenberg Spezial, a German Pilsner. All of Mikulinetsky Brovar's beer is unpasteurized. History The first Austrian archives of a brewery in Mykulyntsi date to 1698. Polish records suggest that the brewery was founded in 1497, which is the date used in the company's official history. Beer started when Tieran, a German ally of the King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, stopped in Mykulyntsi and sent some beer to his leadership during the military campaign. This first production accounts for the brewery's slogan: \\"Beer Brewed for the King\\". In the early 20th Century, the brewery produced three lines of draught and bottled beer. The brewery was purchased by Averman, Tsikhovski & Co., who in 1928 installed an extra cellar, dry house and malt house. In 1939, the company and its facilities were nationalized during the Communist takeover. The company privatized in 1993 as a publicly owned plant. In 1995 the company transformed into an open joint stock company and the company took its current name, Brovar, or brewer. Production Mikulinetsky Brovar produces its own malt using locally grown raw materials. None of the brewery's production line is pasteurized, which is believed by many Ukrainian consumers to be healthier. Production has expanded rapidly. In 2001, a thorough modernization of the brewery started. By 2004, the brewery produced four times more beer than 1993. Today, the brewery operates with state of the art German equipment. The brewery's most popular beer is the \\"Mikulin\\", which accounts for approximately half of its total volume of sales. Its second and third best sellers are the \\"Mikulinetske medove\\" and \\"Mikulin-900\\" Most of its beer is consumed locally - as of 2018, the Ternopil region accounts for 67% of its volume. Recently, several new varieties have been developed using more modern technology. In 2008, the brewery started production of whiskey, in a single-malt variety. The malt is taken directly from its own production. As of 2019, the company offers tours of its facilities. A nearby restaurant of the company also serves its products.

She appeared in the Danish West Indies as Vigilant from 1824. She carried the mail and passenger traffic between St. Croix and St. Thomas in the 19th and the first decade of the 20th century. A storm sank Vigilant on 12 September 1928.  Career  = American service = In her early career she carried flour and cotton down to the West Indies and returned to Baltimore with coffee and sugar. Captain Thomas Boyle commanded her in 1803‚Äì1804 under the American flag. = The Danish West Indies = Circa 1824 Nonsuch was sold to Danish West Indies' authorities, who renamed her Vigilant and used her for coast guard duties. Most famously, while under the command of Danish Captain Irmminger, with thirty soldiers on board, she captured a Spanish pirate ship, cruising and harassing merchant vessels in the narrow passage between St. Thomas and Porto Rico. After her coast guard service, Vigilant became a mail and passenger ship. In the late 1800s she would depart St. Thomas twice a week for a five-to-six hour passage to St. Croix. She had many private owners, until the Government of the Danish West Indies purchased her. In 1865, as steam ships between the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix became well established the steamer Clara Rothe, 266 tons, replaced Vigilant in her mail packet role. Still Vigilant continued to sail well after the beginning of the next century.  Loss  In the night of 13 September 1876, while at anchor at Christiansted, St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, Vigilant sank during a hurricane.

The film stars Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Harry Melling, Van Veronica Ngo and Chiwetel Ejiofor, and follows a team of immortal mercenaries on a revenge mission. The Old Guard was released on July 10, 2020, on Netflix. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and Theron's performance. Plot Andromache \\"Andy\\" of Scythia, Booker, Joe, and Nicky are centuries-old warriors with regenerative healing abilities who use their vast experience to help people. Breaking their rule of working for the same people twice, they're hired by former CIA operative Copley to rescue a group of kidnapped children in South Sudan. During the mission, however, they are ambushed and killed. After healing their wounds and killing their attackers, they realize that Copley set them up and filmed their regeneration. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Nile Freeman has her throat slit while taking down a military target, only to recover without a scratch. Upon waking, she shares a disturbing dream with the other immortals, who are then alerted to her existence. Andy tracks down and takes Nile before military personnel can move her to Germany, where she is due to undergo further testing. Copley shows the video of the ambush to pharmaceutical executive Steven Merrick, who sends operatives to capture the team. Andy brings Nile to France, where Nile meets the rest of their team. She is told about the female immortal Quynh, the first of Andy's comrades, who was cast into the sea in an iron maiden, and has been continually drowning ever since. The group also reveals that they are not truly immortal: their ability to heal eventually stops, without warning, which happened to a previous immortal, Lykon. The group is ambushed by Merrick's forces; Joe and Nicky are captured while a deceased Booker is left behind. After Booker regenerates, Andy kills their assailants but discovers that she has lost her immortality as her injuries do not heal. Booker locates Copley, while Nile separates from the group to reunite with her family. Andy and Booker confront Copley, only for Booker to betray Andy by wounding her, arguing that Merrick might find a way to end the immortality they've both grown weary of. As they are captured, however, Booker realizes that Andy is not healing. Copley has a change of heart when he sees that Merrick is willing to torture the immortals indefinitely to study them. Nile, having realized Booker sold out the group, arrives too late to intervene, but she convinces Copley to assist her in a rescue mission. She storms Merrick's London office and after she frees the rest of the immortals, they fight their way out through the rest of Merrick's security, while Andy and Nile kills Merrick by pushing him out of the window. As punishment for his betrayal, the group forbids Booker from contacting the rest of them for 100 years. The rest of the group meet with Copley, who reveals how their past missions had a greater effect than they ever knew, with the descendants of people they had rescued going on to help the world. With renewed faith in their mission, the group tasks Copley with keeping their existence a secret. Six months later in Paris, a drunken Booker is astonished to meet Quynh in his apartment.  Cast  * Charlize Theron as Andy / Andromache of Scythia * KiKi Layne as Nile Freeman, a former US Marine who served in Afghanistan * Matthias Schoenaerts as Booker / Sebastian Le Livre, once a French soldier who fought under Napoleon * Marwan Kenzari as Joe / Yusuf Al-Kaysani, a Muslim warrior who had participated in the Crusades, as well as Nicky's lover * Luca Marinelli as Nicky / Nicol√≤ di Genova, a former Italian Crusader. He and Joe started off as enemies, but became lovers after discovering their immortality * Chiwetel Ejiofor as James Copley, a former CIA agent grieving the loss of his wife from ALS * Harry Melling as Steven Merrick, the wealthy CEO of a pharmaceutical empire * Van Veronica Ngo as Quynh, an immortal ally from Andy's past * Anamaria Marinca as Dr. Meta Kozak * Joey Ansah as Keane * Micheal Ward as Lykon  Production  In March 2017, Skydance Media picked up the rights to adapt the comic The Old Guard, written by Greg Rucka and illustrated by Leandro Fernandez, into a film. Rucka's contract stipulated that a major scene highlighting the romance between the characters Joe and Nicky from the comic book must also be in the film adaptation. In July 2018, they hired Gina Prince-Bythewood to direct with Rucka adapting his comic book to screenplay and Skydance's David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Don Granger producing. With a budget of about $70 million, Prince-Bythewood became the first black woman to direct a big-budget comic book film. In March 2019, Netflix picked up worldwide rights to the film and agreed to finance it with Skydance. Charlize Theron joined the film and also produced with Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Marc Evans and Skydance's David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger. KiKi Layne was confirmed to star in the film after Netflix picked up the rights. In May 2019, Marwan Kenzari, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Luca Marinelli joined the cast of the film. In June 2019, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Harry Melling, and Veronica Ngo joined the cast of the film. At Ngo's request, details of her character were changed from the comic book. In an interview, Rucka said \\"When Veronica was cast, she said I‚Äôm not Japanese, I‚Äôm Vietnamese. [Director Gina Prince-Bythewood] reached out to me and said ‚ÄòCan we accommodate that?‚Äô and I was like, ‚ÄòAbsolutely.‚Äô [...] Noriko becomes Quynh, Quynh is now Vietnamese. It really was as simple as wanting to honor that, and be respectful of that\\". The other change to the character was the character's death. \\"In the comic, Quynh/Noriko is washed overboard during a storm rather than deliberately drowned. According to Rucka, that was partially a logistical change to save money. [...] But Quynh‚Äôs new 'death,' solidified by Prince-Bythewood‚Äôs suggestion of the iron maiden imagery, served an important narrative and tonal role as well\\". Filming at Bourne Wood in Surrey during August 2019 Principal photography for the film began in Europe in mid-May 2019. Filming took place in Morocco and the United Kingdom, including at Shepperton Studios in England. Sandwich in Kent was used as a double for the French town Goussainville. Sandwich's Discovery Park doubled as Merrick Pharmaceutical headquarters throughout the film. Filming in the famous pub The Prospect of Whitby took place on July 10, 2019. Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka composed the film score. Lakeshore Records released the soundtrack on July 10, 2020, coinciding with the film streaming release. Release The Old Guard was released on July 10, 2020 on Netflix. It was the top-streamed item on the site over its first weekend. It ranked second and fourth the following two weekends. On July 17, Netflix reported the film was on pace to be viewed by 72 million households over its first four weeks, among the top 10 most- successful original launches in the platform's history. That October, Netflix reported the actual figure to have been 78 million. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81% based on 246 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"The Old Guard is occasionally restricted by genre conventions, but director Gina Prince-Bythewood brings a sophisticated vision to the superhero genre - and some knockout action sequences led by Charlize Theron.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B+\\" and said: \\"Steeped in hand-to-hand action... but with enough ballistic firepower to kit out a small civil war, every action sequence is more than awe-inspiring; they're necessary to the film itself. Superhero battles that are eye popping and narratively motivated? Oh, yeah.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film a \\"watchable franchise wannabe\\" and wrote: \\"Chunks of the picture are logy and formulaic (it dawdles on for two hours), but the director, Gina Prince-Bythewood (making a major lane change after Love & Basketball and The Secret Life of Bees), stages the fight scenes with ripe executionary finesse, and she teases out a certain soulful quality in her cast.\\" Bob Chipman of Escapist gave the film 7 out of 10 and said: \\"This is a clever, slick, progressive minded, yet also brutally violent, frequently kick ass action film\\" and that \\"they clearly want it to be a franchise, I'd certainly watch another one.\\" The film's portrayal of LGBT characters within the superhero genre was praised. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast said that The Old Guard \\"is the first movie with out gay superheroes, or the extremely (extremely) rare action film to feature queer characters and acknowledge their romance. [...] The sexuality of the characters is matter-of- fact and inconsequential to their ability to kick total-and-complete ass, yet also given the dignity of expressing and showing their love\\". Benjamin Lee, for The Guardian, wrote that \\"in 2020, it really shouldn't be such a big deal, but watching a form of unfettered queer love exist within the confines of a fantastical comic book adaptation, aimed at a wide audience, felt major to me.\\" Anna Menta of Decider wrote \\"I hadn't read The Old Guard comic, and I didn't know that writer Greg Rucka had stipulated in his contract that, whenever or however the film got made, it had to include that scene. So when it happened, well, it felt‚Äîand still does feel‚Äîlike a huge freakin' deal. [...] It's just as passionate, just as charged, and just as sensual as Han and Leia, Peter and MJ, Peeta and Katniss, or any other heterosexual couple who's had a big kiss moment in an action movie over the years\\".  Possible sequel On the coda at the beginning of The Old Guards credits, Rucka said \\"In case of sequel, break glass. It‚Äôs very straightforward. You want another one? Here‚Äôs a way to get into it\\". A sequel to the original graphic novel, The Old Guard: Force Multiplied, was published in 2019. Theron has expressed her interest in a second film, saying: \\"Let's have a little resting period, but just given the fact that all of us really want to do it, I'm sure when it's the right time, we'll start the conversation.\\" References  External links  * 2020 films 2020 action thriller films 2020 LGBT- related films 2020s superhero films American action thriller films American films American LGBT-related films American superhero films English-language Netflix original films Fiction about immortality Films based on Image Comics Films directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood Films produced by Charlize Theron Films scored by Dustin O'Halloran Films set in France Films set in London Films set in Morocco Films set in South Sudan Films shot in Morocco Films shot at Shepperton Studios Gay-related films Girls with guns films LGBT-related thriller films Live-action films based on comics Skydance Media films Superhero thriller films War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) films ","title":"The Old Guard (2020 film)"},{"id":"60599050","title":"Soundtrack (Wizards of Oz album)"},{"id":"60599051","text":"The Urtatagai conflict was a conflict between the Soviet Union and the Emirate of Afghanistan in the mid-1920s over the control of the island of Urtatagai, which is an island on the Amu Darya river that had been claimed by Afghanistan since 1900, although it was under Russian control until 1920, when remnants of the Imperial Russian Army evacuated the island to aid the White Movement in the Russian Civil War. The Afghan Army had earlier unsuccessfully tried to enforce its claim on Urtatagai in a border conflict in 1913, and in 1920 Afghan forces were finally able to capture the island unopposed. On 27 November 1925, due to repeated incursions into Soviet territory by Basmachi rebels using the island as a base, as well as the Soviet claim to the Island, 340 Soviet troops landed on the island of Urtatagai, and a clash with the island's garrison saw 12 people killed, and 5 Afghans were taken prisoner. On 18 December, the Prime Minister of Afghanistan issued a letter of protest, making 4 key demands: * That the soviets abandon the Island * That prisoners of war be returned * That Afghan losses be recovered * That official apologies be rendered. On 19 December, after the Soviets failed to answer the letter, the Afghan Government began to deploy troops towards the North. To the surprise of the Soviet leadership, Western press took interest in the conflict, and supported the Afghan government. With potential war looming, the Soviet leadership decided to let a joint commission decide Urtatagai's fate, which ruled in favour of Afghanistan. On 28 February 1926, the Soviets transferred the island to Afghanistan in a ceremony. Negotiations regarding official Soviet recognition ensued for the following months, and after the Afghan government agreed to restrain Basmachi border raids, the Soviet government officially recognized Urtatagai as part of the Afghan state on 15 August 1926.

T√ºger, D√∂ƒüer, Dogar or Deogers (, , ) was one of the 24 Oghuz tribes from the Bozok wing, the tribe of Ay Khan. According to Mahmud Kashgari, it was the eighteenth biggest tribe among the Oghuz tribes. The Turkoman dynasty of Artuqids, which ruled the Beylik of same name, originated from the tribe of D√∂ger.  History  In the pre-Islamic era, Dogers occupied an important place. Also, they played a significant role as warriors in the Seljuk army during the latter's conquest of Iran and Anatolia. The dynasty of Turkoman origin, the Artukids, derived from the Doger tribe as well. Dogers had tremendous influence among the Turkomans for centuries and were considered a noble tribe. They lived under the leadership of Salim Beg Doger in the territory of the present-day Syria, and their beylik (principality) was constantly attacked by the Kara Koyunlu and Mamluks. The Doger tribe, who mostly lived in Northwestern Syria and was associated with both Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkomans, never joined any of the confederations.Woods, John E. The Aqquyunlu: Clan, Confederation, Empire; University of Utah Press; 1999. pp. 188‚Äî189 At the beginning of the 15th century, Dogers were among the most important Turkoman allies of the Mamluk army on the northern border; and in the rivalry between Kara Usman and Kara Yusuf, they appeared first on one side, then on the other. However, by 1415 they had lost control over many of their former centers at Diyar Mudar, over the Arab tribes of Syria, and over Ak Koyunlu in Diyarbakir. After the death of Kara Usman in 1435, the Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Barsbay ordered the Dogers to attack Ak-Koyunlu near Amid; their victory over the Turkoman Confederation, however, marked their last emergence as a real political force in the region.Woods, John E. The Aqquyunlu: Clan, Confederation, Empire; University of Utah Press; 1999. pp. 188‚Äî189 During the Ottoman conquest, Syria was again inhabited by the Dogers who had their aimaks there. Their aimaks dwelled mostly in Aleppo, Dimashq, Urfa, Boz Ulus, Kirkuk and Kozan.

Publications  To the published books of Ernst Homburg belong: (dissertation) In his dissertation, Homburg described the important transformations during the first half of the nineteenth century in the character and the organization of the chemical industries in Europe. The leading positions in the management of the factories were then for the first time taken by industrial chemists. This process, together with the formation of an occupational group of high social prestige, was especially visible in Germany. There was an important relation with the development of polytechnic education. Homburg considers the transformation of polytechnic and university chemical education more as a cause than as a consequence of the emergence of the occupation of the chemist. Many scholars, that wrote about the development of the chemist's occupation in the context of the development of university education, like Joseph Ben-David, Bernard Henry Gustin, Erica Hickel,See for instance Ingunn Possehl, and R. Steven TurnerSee for example and Ulrike K√∂ster, had created the impression that the emergence of the chemical occupation was the exclusive result of the work of Justus von Liebig (1803-1873). The broader social perspective was lacking. No reference was made to the interplay between events in this particular domain of work and knowledge and the development of the social division of labour as a whole. Homburg tries to fill this gap in the main body of his dissertation. Especially the short period between 1830 and 1850 marked a radical change in the organisation of education. Apart from the changes in the German educational system, a \\"veritable revolution of the laboratory\\" occurred. Especially the emergence of analytical chemistry caused the development of new laboratories, with smaller apparatuses, and the possibility to give laboratory instruction a more prominent place in chemical education. The last part of the dissertation summarizes the new functions in which the chemically trained found their occupation. * (The history of chemistry in the Netherlands; published in 3 vols. 1993, 1997, 2004)  (Growth by Fertilizer : DSM Agro 1929-2004)  Ernst Homburg was one of the chemistry editors of: * See for instance: Editorial Board of vol. 7 and of vol. 8.
