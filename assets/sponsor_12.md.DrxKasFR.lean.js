While Kasai went into practice at a time when pediatric surgery was not an established subspecialty, much of his clinical and research work was related to the surgical care of children. He is best known for devising a surgical procedure, the hepatoportoenterostomy, to address a life-threatening birth defect known as biliary atresia. The modern form of the operation is still known as the Kasai procedure. A graduate of the medical school at Tohoku University, Kasai remained there for most of his medical career, chairing the university's 2nd Department of Surgery and serving on the school's Board of Councilors. Though best known for the procedure that came to bear his name, Kasai also studied peritonitis in infants and children, and he made contributions to the understanding of esophageal cancer, pediatric liver cancer and a colon abnormality known as Hirschsprung's disease. Kasai practiced from the 1940s until 1993, spending the last few years of his career leading a hospital in Tohoku. He suffered a debilitating stroke in 1999 and died in 2008. Early life Kasai was born in Aomori Prefecture, located in the northernmost portion of the Japanese mainland. By junior high school, he lived in Hokkaido. He graduated from high school in Sendai and attended medical school there at Tohoku University. After training as a general surgeon, Kasai joined the Tohoku University faculty in the early 1950s. Kasai's early career interests included postoperative fluid and electrolyte management as well as the care of infants and children with peritonitis. In 1959‚Äì60, Kasai spent nine months in the United States completing a pediatric surgical fellowship under C. Everett Koop at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). By 1960, Kasai had attained the rank of Associate Professor at Tohoku. Three years later, he had become a full professor and department chair. The Kasai procedure Kasai and a colleague, Sozo Suzuki, worked together in the 1950s to devise a surgery to treat babies born with biliary atresia. While American surgeon William E. Ladd had first described surgery for the condition in the 1920s, the widely held belief was that only a small percentage of cases were amenable to any type of surgical interventions, and most affected children died before reaching one year of age. Surgeons had tried to explore the biliary tract to identify any viable ductules that could help to restore bile flow in these patients. Kasai felt that surgeons had not been performing such dissection aggressively enough. He found that sometimes a biliary tract appeared solid but that if he removed the entire biliary tract outside of the liver, it often contained enough ductules to promote bile flow. Kasai devised an important component of the procedure essentially by accident. One day, he encountered significant bleeding near the portion of the liver known as the porta hepatis while trying to dissect an infant's ductules. To try to stop the bleeding, he attached a loop of the child's duodenum over the porta hepatis. The bleeding stopped, and the team was surprised to find bile in the feces after the surgery. Kasai published his work on the procedure in the Japanese journal Shujutsu in 1959, and his work was not widely known outside of Japan until he published some results in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery in 1968. The surgery became known as the Kasai procedure, though Kasai himself was uncomfortable having the intervention named after him. Surgeons in the western world remained skeptical about the procedure well into the 1970s, so most of the case series of long-term survivors were published in Japan. As of 2012, a survivor of biliary atresia in his fifties was known to be alive in Japan. While the procedure is not a definitive cure for biliary atresia and about half of patients require liver transplantation by the age of two, a 2015 article in The Journal of Pediatrics said that the international adoption of the procedure had \\"dramatically changed the outcome of biliary atresia.\\" Later career Kasai and his colleagues at the university formulated a classification system for hepatoblastoma, a type of liver cancer seen in children. He also devised a surgery to correct Hirschsprung's disease (rectal myotomy with colectomy); he noted that it involved less surgical exploration in the pelvic area and he felt that it would reduce the loss of sensation in the rectum in comparison to the common procedure at that time. Kasai also attempted the aggressive surgical treatment of esophageal cancer at a time when palliative treatment was standard. In the 1970s, Kasai came to the United States again to work with Koop and his colleague Louise Schnaufer at CHOP, where they established a specialized surgical program for biliary atresia. Koop became Surgeon General of the United States in 1981, and Schnaufer remained at CHOP, where she performed the Kasai procedure more than 150 times and trained a number of pediatric surgical fellows to perform the procedure. In 1986, a 63-year-old Kasai faced mandatory retirement from Tohoku University, as is common in academic centers in Japan. He became the director of the NTT Tohoku Hospital for a few years, retiring from that job in 1993. Later life Kasai, who enjoyed skiing and mountain climbing, was well into his sixties when he led a team from Tohoku University as they became the first group to climb the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains in Tibet. Recognized several times for his contributions to medicine and to society, Kasai received honors and awards including the William E. Ladd Medal from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Denis Browne Gold Medal from the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons and the Asahi Prize from the national newspaper known as the Asahi Shimbun. Kasai suffered a stroke in 1999 and he spent several years in physical rehabilitation before he died in 2008.

Funny Face was a brand of drink mix originally made and publicly sold by the Pillsbury Company, from 1964 to 1994. and in limited productions (mainly in the Midwestern and New England regions of the U.S.A.) from 1994 to 2001. The brand was introduced as competition to the similar (and more familiar and better-selling) Kool-Aid made by Kraft Foods. The product came in assorted flavors and was intended to be mixed with water to make an enjoyable-tasting beverage. The product name \\"Funny Face\\" was based on the packaging and advertising created by Hal Silverman of the Campbell Mithun advertising agency. Each flavor was designated by a cartoon character with an amusingly- distorted face. The original flavors, and their names, were Goofy Grape, Rootin' Tootin' Raspberry, Freckle-Face Strawberry, Loud-Mouth Lime, Injun Orange, and Chinese Cherry. These last two, being offensive ethnic stereotypes, were soon renamed to Jolly-Olly Orange and Choo Choo Cherry. Additional flavors were added later, including Captain Black Cherry, Chilly Cherry Cola, Lefty Lemonade (and Lefty Lemon-Lime), Loud Mouth Punch, Pistol Pink Lemonade, Rah-Rah Root beer, Rudi Tutti-Frutti, Tart Lil' Imitation Lemonade, Tart 'N' Tangy Lemon, With-It Watermelon, Top Banana, and Chug-a- Lug-a Chocolate, the latter intended to be mixed with milk rather than water. The mix was sweetened with calcium cyclamate. Cyclamates and its salts (including calcium cyclamate and sodium cyclamate) were banned in the United States in 1970; it was briefly replaced by saccharin, which proved unpopular, after which the product was offered unsweetened. Various promotional tchotchkes were offered as premiums in support of the brand, such as mugs and pitchers bearing the likeness of the various cartoon faces associated with each flavor. A series of children's books such as \\"How Freckle Face Strawberry Got His Name\\" and similar titles were published. The brand's tagline was \\"Funny Face is Fun To Drink!\\" The Funny Face brand was purchased by Brady Enterprises in 1980, and continued to sell nationwide until 1994. A limited production relaunch (albeit with some modifications for the 21st century) was briefly sold in selected areas from 1994 to 2001. On November 28, 2012, Decas Cranberry Products out of Carver, Massachusetts re-relaunched the Funny Face drink mix product and currently has resurrected a total of four of the original characters; this includes Rootin' Tootin' Raspberry, Freckle Face Strawberry, Choo Choo Cherry, and Goofy Grape. Once again, they received updated packaging designs for more modern times. A line of flavored dried cranberry and fruit snacks was also introduced using the four reprised characters.

The Diamniadio Lake City is a LEED certified project. On completion, the new city will be connected to Dakar through a 32 km express highway, which will reduce the travel time from 90 minutes to an average of 30 minutes. The first regional electric express train, the Train Express Regional (TER), is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2019. The time frame for building the new city is 10 years, as per the memorandum of understanding with the Senegalese government. The city will have several financial, transport, and educational hubs.

The FNWA is parented by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and was launched under the union movements' renewed focus on indigenous working rights.  Current campaigns  The FNWA is currently campaigning on behalf of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander CDP workers, which the ACTU and the FNWA claim is racially discriminatory. The ACTU (head of the Alliance) has resolved to use all means available to the union to explore \\"legal and legislative challenges to the program, as well as the mobilization of campaign resources.\\" = Community Development Program (CDP) = The CDP is a work-for-the-dole scheme used in remote communities for job seekers. Replacing the Remote Jobs and Communities Program in 2015, the program currently operates in \\"60 regions and more than 1,000 communities across Australia.\\" As the program specifically targets remote areas, the main reasons for unemployment can be attributed to weak labour markets and difficulty gaining experience. The CDP requires job seekers to complete 25 hours of work per week for all weeks of the year, (currently due to be reduced to 20 hours per week in early 2019. These job services are provided in a range of activities for $11.60 an hour. These activities are aimed at improving the community and providing new skills for the job seekers. As of 30 June 2018 the government states that the CDP \\"has supported remote job seekers into more than 25,584 Jobs\\" since the implementation of the program in 2015. The program currently has approximately 32,000 people registered, with more than 80% of workers being indigenous people in remote areas.  Criticism of the CDP  The CDP was referred to the Finance and public administration references committee for a Senate inquiry and report on 22 March 2017. The findings of the inquiry were handed down on 14 December 2017. The Senate inquiry handed down 22 recommendations, ranging from financial penalties to government support for remote communities. The report also concluded that \\"The committee is of the view that CDP cannot and should not continue in its current form. A new program needs to be developed which moves away from a centralised, top-down administration in which communities are told what to do and move towards a model where the local communities are empowered to make decisions that are best for them.\\" Financial penalties for workers on CDP are one of the biggest areas of concern for the FNWA. Those currently under the care of the CDP receive different penalties for missing or refusing suitable work than those on Newstart in major cities. As the vast majority of recipients of CDP are indigenous, the differing requirement for financial penalties are regarded by the FNWA as \\"racially discriminatory\\". Since the program was rolled out in 2015, \\"more than 340,000 fines have been issued to people enrolled in the Community Development Program\\". The financial penalties currently being handed out under the CDP are more frequent, as the CDP has seen a \\"740% increase in financial penalties since it replaced the previous remote job and communities program in 2015.\\" Pro Bono News Australia reported that \\"CDP participants currently have to work up to 500 hours more per year than those covered by metropolitan work-for-the-dole programs, and were 25 times more likely to be fined than other work-for-the-dole participant\\". The Senate committee responsible for the inquiry into the CDP reported in the recommendations: > \\"That the Australian Government immediately replace the current CDP > compliance and penalty regime with obligations that are no more onerous than > those of other income support recipients.

Pre-1569, in the 1390 Melibeus by Geoffrey Chaucer, the author uses the term \\"mortal woundes\\" in the quote \\"Thre of his olde foos..betten his wif wounded his doghter with fyue mortal woundes\\", this is where Melibeus's daughter received five mortal wounds, when three of his foes found Melibeus's wife and daughter alone in his house. = 1500s = In 1569, mortally wounded was used in the text Certaine Secrete Wonders Nature by Edward Fenton in \\"aboue 400 dead bodies, beside 140 mortally wounded and almost torne in peces\\", the quote explains that due to the extreme heat of a fire 140 men are wounded, the account said that they looked like they had been torn to pieces. In 1578, mortal wound was used in the poetic text Courtlie Controuersie of Cupids Caulels by Jacques Yver translated by Henry Wotton in \\"His mortal wound, that no long before was almost cured y a fomentation of the oyle of time, and neare skinned with hope of the recouerie of his welbeloued Iewel,\\" the author describes how the personas old mortal wound was not yet recovered and as it was a serious wound, yet he hoped he would recover completely. In 1581, mortal wound was used in the historical non-fiction History of the Reformation of the Church of England by Gilbert Burnet and Nicholas Sander in \\"He went to Rome; and giving the Assault, in which received his mortal wound\\" whereVaudemont went to subdue the battle but was prevented by the Duke of Boubon receiving a mortal wound, the Duke of Boubon then proceeded with the battle in Rome causing many deaths as well as leading The Pope with a few Cardinals to flee for safety. In 1593, mortal wound was used in the sonnet Fidessa, More Chaste than Kind: Sonnet XXVII in \\"Yet every foot gives thee thy mortal wound\\" the quote comes from the Sonnet that describes a man stumbling in the street at night as he metaphorically compares his existence to that of a worm and due to the habitat of worms every step a person takes could be a mortal wound inflicted on worm ultimately leading to its death. In the Sonnet, the man believes that his existence is worse than that of a worm. = 1600s = In 1661 mortal wound is used in the religious text The Unsearchable Riches of Christ where \\"The Lord Jesus hath given such a mortal wound by his death and Spirit\\" the text explains that because Jesus sacrificed himself and received his mortal wound in the New Testament because he did not die straight away but died \\"little by little\\" allowed him to rid the whole world of sin. In 1667 mortal wound is used in John Milton's Paradise Lost VI. In his epic biblical poem based on the retelling of Genesis he uses the term mortal wound in the passage \\"cannot but by annihilating die; Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound Receive, no more than can the fluid air,\\" Milton explains spirits cannot receive mortal wounds due to the nature of their intangible form. In 1672 the term mortal wound is used in the medical text The Chirurgical and Anatomical Works of Paul Barbette, the text defines mortal wound as \\"A mortal Wound is that, which in the Space of few hours, or dayes, of necessity causes Death, and cannot by any Artt be Cured.\\" The text further goes on to explain that if a wound is curable but has been neglected by the patient and results in death that it is not considered a mortal wound even though it resulted in the patients death. This also applies to wounds that are incurable and allow the patient to live for weeks to years. Therefore, the author explains that if the wound does not result in a \\"sudden\\" death it is not considered a \\"mortal wound.\\" =1700s= The London Gazette is one of the British governments official journals. In the 1714 The London Gazette: Issue 5228, under the Advertisements section, mortal wound is used to describe an injury a man named Edward Hurley received from a Two-Bill from the quote \\"Whereas one Henry Bray, Weaver, now or late of Culmstock, in the County of Devon, did on Tuesday the 18th Instant, give one Edward Hurley ‚Ä¶ a mortal Wound on the Head with a Two- Bill, that he dy‚Äôd.\\" the journal goes on to describe Henry Bray's appearance, mannerisms and the clothes he usually wears as well as stating that anyone that helps bring him to justice will receive a monetary reward. The first dictionary that had an entry for mortal wound is Edward Phillips's The New World of Words: or, Universal English Dictionary, 16th edition, published in 1720. The entry says \\"Mortal Wound. See Wound\\" at the entry for wound the definition for mortal wound states \\"Mortal Wound, is that which must unavoidably be follow'd by Death, when it is situate deep in a principal Part, necessary for the Preservation of Life: Such are wounds in the Heart, Lungs, Midriff, Liver, Spleen Etc. and generally in all the great Vessels\\". Poet Allan Ramsay, during 1724, in Health: a poem 1st edition described \\"When th‚Äô uvula has got its mortal wound, and tongue and lips form words without a sound;\\" where he states that the uvula had received a mortal wound, using the term metaphorically to describe an uvula infection possibly due to Influenza which often lead to death in the 1700s. In 1760 mortal wound is used in the Trial of Lawrence Earl Ferrers, for the Murder of John Johnson. John Johnson received \\"One mortal Wound of the ‚ÄòBreadth of One Inch and Depth of Four Inches; of which said moral Wound the said John Johnson did ... live, until the Nineteenth Day of the same Month of January, ... on which Day, ... he the said John Johnson, of the mortal Wound aforesaid, died.\\" During the trial the Juror's found Lawrence Earl Ferrers guilty for murder as he purposefully and without remorse injured John Johnson which lead to his death. Other examples of \\"mortal wound\\" are found inside: *The 1725 written account of The Last confession and Dying Words of John Gow, *The 1767 non-fiction text A Practical Treatise on Wounds and Other Chirurgical Subjects by Benjamin Gooch, = 1800s = In the 1817 love poem Laon and Cythna by Percy Bysshe Shelley used mortal wound to describe \\"Upon his enemies heart a mortal wound to wreck,\\" where a metaphorical eagle wished to give his enemy: a serpent, a mortal wound. The 1838 romance novel Leila II. ii. by Edward Bulwer-Lytton uses mortal wound to depict the scene \\"while the blood oozes slow and gurgling from a mortal wound,\\" this line occurs when a soldier wearing armour did not appear to have been wounded but blood was leaking from a serious wound he had sustained. The 1865 text Camps and Prisons. Twenty Months in the Department of the Gulf by Augustine Joseph Hickey Duganne is a collection of personal accounts of the civil war. Mortal wound is used by the author when he exclaims \\"And the wide land with mortal wound outbleeds!\\" the author is describing the mass of men that are found with seriously injured throughout the land he stands on. = 1900s = In the 1982 non-fiction Tortious Liability for Unintentional Harm in the Common Law and the Civil Law, the author discusses problems associated with liability in European Law. He uses the term mortal wound to discuss the issue of accountability regarding mortally wounding a slave. The author states \\"In the first, Celsus, Marcellus and Ulpian agree that if one man gives a slave a moral wound and another afterwards kills him, only the latter is liable under the first chapter for killing the former only under the third for wounding,\\" while contrastingly he also explains \\"Julian‚Ä¶ says... if one man gives a slave a mortal wound and after an interval another strikes him in a way as to hasten his death, both are liable for killing.\\" The author explains that the juxtaposition is due to Julian focusing on the original wound being intentionally mortal, leading to the slaves death, while Celsus contradicts Julian and mainly focuses on the importance of the resulting death of the slave. The religious text The Apocalypse: A Reading of the Revelation of John published in 1994 uses the term moral wound in reference to Revelation 13:3, the text describes a beast where \\"one of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its wound was healed,\\" The author explains that this section of Revelation 13 refers to the legend of Nero, Roman Emperor, ‚Äòcoming back to life‚Äô or still being alive after receiving a mortal wound and his vengeful goal of leading the Parthian army to the destroy Rome. In the 1997 text Virgil's Aeneid: Semantic Relations and Proper Names the author reflects on Virgil's epic poem using mortal wound in \\"The mortal wound that Turnus inflicted on the youth made this wound an unhealable one.\\" this is where Turnus and Aeneas are battling in Italy, even though Aeneas is injured he returns to battle and \\"Aeneas inflicts the mortal wound on Turnus in the name of ‚ÄòPallas‚Äô.\\" where Aeneas takes vengeance for Turnus killing his friend Pallas. Other examples of \\"mortal wound\\" are found inside: * The 1964 novel The Mortal Wound by Raffaele La Capria about a man's connection with Naples during his travels to Rome, * The 1968 novel King, Queen, Knave by Vladimir Nabokov \\"he threatened her with a priapus that had already once inflicted upon her an almost mortal wound,\\"  Modern usage  The number of Google search hits on 12 August 2006 for \\"mortally wounded\\" was 989,000 The number of Google hits on 12 October 2018 for \\"mortal wound\\" had 346,000 results and \\"mortally wounded\\" had 1,660,000 results. More modern usage of the term mortal wound is often more figurative than literal: seen in the 1998 article Paternal Style Leaves Mortal Wounds by Deutsch Stephen. The article talks about the demise of a hospital without a director present and a proper mission statement which would lead to its implied 'eventual' death. = Usage in law = The Law Dictionary (2013) defines the term mortal wound as \\"the term that is applied to a wound that is fatal\\" In the 2007 Republic of Philippines Supreme Court Petition for Review of Lazaro (petitioner) versus Crisaldo Alberto (prosecutor) the decision report uses the term \\"mortal wound\\", it discusses the importance of being able to discern whether the petitioner had inflicted a mortal or non-mortal wound on the prosecutor Crisaldo in determining the sentence for Lazaro. If the Jury believed that Crisaldo had been inflicted with a mortal wound, which would have led to death if untreated, then Lazaro would be accused of attempted murder, rather than frustrated murder. According to Causation in Criminal Law from the Pennsylvania Law Review the term \\"mortal wound\\" is used to denote that an injury is serious. In Causation in the Law from Oxford University Press, the term \\"mortal wound\\" is given three meanings: (i) an injury that is likely to cause death to an average person under normal circumstances (ii) an injury that has a high likelihood of causing the victim death if left untreated medically; (iii) an injury that is likely to cause death even though it does not apply to the first two circumstances (e.g. a minor injury neglected by the victim). = Usage in the media = The 2018 Australian news article Dutton delivers mortal wound to Turnbull uses \\"mortal wound\\" metaphorically as the death of Prime minister Turnbull's party's support. Member of parliament Petter Dutton challenged Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull for leadership of the Australian Liberal Party. The article describes it as, when fewer than 60% of a prime minister's colleagues support him he is a \\"dead leader walking.\\" Being Frightened is not a Mortal Wound is a 2017 article written by the Times Columnist as a response to a letter on 2 November, Let‚Äôs rethink Halloween Fireworks. The letter describes its dissatisfaction that people believe that taking offence is synonymous with being mortally wounded. They use this stance to argue that people are being overly cautious by trying to alter the halloween fireworks due to the possibility of frightening animals and children.

The practice is considered unsportsmanlike and unethical, with punishments for such offences ranging from official warnings to career bans, depending on the severity of the offence. Widespread illegal substance abuse in tennis developed during the 1980s and 1990s as performance-enhancing substances became increasingly available in professional sport. The detection and punishment for the use of drugs in this period was aided by the takeover of policing drug cheating by the International Tennis Federation in 1993.  History  Anti-doping policy within tennis primarily developed from the 1980s with the increased prevalence of recreational drugs and steroid use among athletes across various sporting professions. According to the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the Men's Tennis Council began drug testing in the late 1980s. The drug testing program that was administered by the Men's Tennis Council targeted recreational drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, before the creation of the ATP Tour in 1990 marked an official transition towards performance-enhancing drug regulation. From 1993, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA World Tour), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) and International Tennis Federation (ITF) led a combined anti-doping initiative in professional tennis. Following the joint initiative between the ATP and WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) became the sole governing body for professional tennis anti- doping initiatives in 2007, as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA World Tour) moved towards a player-focused organisation and administrative role. Other bodies that regulate doping within tennis on a national level include the United States Anti-Doping Agency.  Doping in men's tennis  = Andre Agassi (1997) = Andre Agassi (2006) In 1997, Andre Agassi returned a positive drug test for the use of methamphetamine. A joint investigation carried out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) handed down a three-month suspension from professional tennis for the incident. However, the punishment was not formally handed down after Agassi blamed the positive result on a spiked drink. Agassi's case was revisited in 2009 following the publication of Agassi's autobiography, Open: An Autobiography, where Agassi admitted to lying about the cause of his positive drug test result. Agassi admitted that he became addicted to methamphetamine during 1997 after his assistant introduced him to the drug and he faced both personal and professional problems. Following the admission, no formal case has been opened against Agassi as the offence was committed prior to the establishment of the World-Anti Doping Agency in 1999 and the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) formal takeover of the ATP World Tour's anti-doping program since 2007. = Richard Gasquet (2009) = In 2009, Richard Gasquet returned a positive drug result for cocaine use. Gasquet denied intentional use of the drug, citing that he may have been exposed to the substance after kissing a female at a Miami nightclub (known in the media as \\"The Cocaine Kiss Controversy\\"). Richard Gasquet (2015)The International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the World Anti-Doping Agency were initially seeking a two-year ban because of the substance used in the incident. Due to Gasquet's denial, and the small amount of cocaine detected, Gasquet initially received a one-year ban. However, this was overturned following an independent review that found the case was unintentional. The ITF and WADA challenged the ruling in the Court of Arbitration for Sport but were unsuccessful. Consequently, Gasquet received a formal six-week ban that came into effect in May 2009 to July 2009, which prevented him from competing in the French Open or Wimbledon. During this period his professional ranking fell nine places. This was the only punishment enforced by governing authorities, with no prize money fine or forfeiture of ranking being imposed. An independent tribunal ruled that Gasquet had not intentionally consumed the substance, that it was not performance-enhancing, and that he would have consumed the bare minimum amount to be detected. In January 2010, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found Gasquet not guilty of a doping offence and he returned to professional tennis following the ban at the Australian Open in 2010. = Marin Cilic (2013) = In 2013, Marin Cilic returned a positive drug test for the substance nikethamide. The drug is a widely used stimulant that effects respiratory function through the increase in blood flow and oxygen intake within the body. Marin Cilic (2015)Cilic denied having deliberately taken the drug, stating that the substance was contained in glucose tablets that were purchased from a pharmacy while he was competing in France. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) recognised Cilic's claim and did not hand down the regular two-year professional ban for instances of illegal doping. Instead, he received a nine-month ban due to the low level of the drug that was detected and the contextual circumstances. The initial ban would have prevented Cilic from competing in the 2013 US Open and the 2014 Australian Open with the suspension period extending from May 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014. However, following a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Cilic's nine-month ban was reduced to four months, with a retrospective provisioning period recognising time already spent away from the game. The ruling also resulted in the return of Cilic's prize money and ATP World Tour points from the 2013 French Open, 2013 Wimbledon and 2013 BMW Open where he tested positive to nikethamide. Cilic returned to the professional tennis on 25 October 2013. = Viktor Troicki (2013) = Victor Troicki (2011) In 2013, Viktor Troicki refused to partake in a mandatory blood test carried out by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). As part of the 2013 anti-doping program administered by the governing body, it is compulsory that when requested by ITF staff, that players provide in and/or out-of- competition blood and urine testing. While it is possible for players to ask to be excused from such test, it is at the discretion of the ITF to postpone such tests. Troicki stated he did not agree to the blood test as he was sick when the test was ordered by the ITF, however, he did provide the mandatory urine sample. In conjunction with his illness, Troicki also suffers from a phobia of needles that makes such tests difficult to administer. Having refused Troicki's claim, the ITF handed down an 18-month ban due to the failure to comply with the organisations anti-doping regulations. The initial ban prevented Troicki from competing professionally on the ITF Challenger or ATP World Tour from 26 July 2013 until 24 January 2015, missing the 2013 US Open, all the 2014 Grand Slams and 2015 Australian Open. The punishment also enforced the forfeiture of all ATP World Tour points and prize money received at the 2013 Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament where he refused to participate in the blood test. Troicki appealed the sentence to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2013 and was successful in having his ban reduced by 6 months from 18 to a total 12-month ban. The new sentence prevented Troicki from competing professionally from 26 July 2013 to 26 July 2014 with the sentence recognising time already spent suspended from the game. Troicki returned to professional tennis in July 2014 at a world ranking of 847 that prevented him from returning to the ATP World Tour. He returned to tournaments on the International Tennis Federation's Challenger circuit.  Doping in women's tennis  = Martina Hingis (2007)= Martina Hingis (2014) In 2007, Martina Hingis tested positive to the drug Benzoylecgonine, a substance that has traces to cocaine. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) gave Hingis a two-year suspension from professional tennis that began on 1 October 2007 in conjunction with a forfeiture of her world ranking and a fine exceeding $120,000. Hingis challenged the ruling, however, this was refused by the ITF as she had already announced a retirement from the sport. Hingis maintained her innocence stating she had never used cocaine and subsequently carried out a private drug test which returned a negative result. Despite the disparity in results, Hingis retired from professional tennis for the second time and did not formally challenge the ruling. Hingis later returned to tennis in 2013, and attained the world number one ranking on the WTA women's doubles circuit. = Barbora Zahlavova Strycova (2013) = Babora Zhalavova Strycova (2010) In 2013, Barbora Zahlavova Strycova tested positive to the banned stimulant, sibutramine while competing at the 2013 Luxembourg Open. The drug is primarily used for weight loss with its effects on human metabolic function. The substance is widely prescribed to sufferers of obesity and diabetes with the main effect of the drug being an appetite suppressant. The drug was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substance list in 2012. Zahlavova Strycova stated she did not deliberately ingest the drug to lose weight or cheat in competition, but did admit to using a weight-loss supplement Acai Berry Thin which has the substance as one of the ingredients. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) recognised that Zhalavova Strycova did not intentionally take the drug for the benefit of her professional game and thus did not hand down the maximum two-year ban for illegal doping, however, she did receive a six-month ban from professional tennis. In conjunction with the suspension of play, Zhalavova Strycova was also forced to forfeit all WTA Tour points and prize money from the 2012 Luxembourg Open and 2012 Buschl Open when the substance was in her body. The ban prevented Zahlavova Strycova competing from 16 October 2012 until 16 April 2013, ruling her out of the 2013 Australian Open. = Maria Sharapova (2016) = Maria Sharapova (2015) In 2016, Maria Sharapova confessed to failing a WADA drug test while playing at the Australian Open in 2016. The substance used was a drug named meldonium that is used to treat heart disease with its effects on blood circulation through the transfer of fatty acids into the human body. Sharapova maintained there was no wrongdoing on her behalf, having admitted to using the prescription based drug for over ten years due to her susceptibility to influenza, treatment for symptoms of diabetes and magnesium deficiency. On 1 January 2016, the drug was placed on the International Tennis Federation's banned substance list as it was ruled to have performance-enhancing effects. Such effects include increased blood circulation through the greater intake of oxygen that enables increased exercise ability and a reduced recovery period. A report handed down by the International Tennis Federation and World Anti- Doping Agency found that while Sharapova may not have been consciously using the substance to increase performance, it is the responsibility of the player and team to be aware of new additions to the banned substance list. As a result, Sharapova was initially issued a two-year ban by the ITF that prevented her from competing professionally on the WTA World Tour until 25 January 2018. Following an investigation by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2016, Sharapova's ban was reduced from two years to 15 months after it was found there was no intention to cheat and no significant fault on her behalf. The ruling enabled Sharapova to return to competitive tennis on April 26, 2017. During her ban Sharapova published her memoir, Unstoppable: My Life So Far, that was published in June 2018. Sharapova returned to grand slam tennis at the 2018 US Open through a wildcard entry. She made it to the fourth round before losing to Anastasija Sevastova.  List of banned substances  Banned anabolic steroid canisters.The list of banned substances in tennis as it stands in 2018 has been published by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The prohibited substance list is categorised into the following: * Anabolic agents: include the use of anabolic steroids that increase testosterone levels in players. The drug is prohibited as it hastens the process of muscle growth in athletes and allows for limited recovery time post matches. A full list of itemised anabolic agents is listed on the ITF website. *Peptide hormones: include the use of drugs with amino acid chains that accelerate human growth in protein based hormones. The use of such substances can accelerate the development of muscle tissue and testosterone levels within the body. *Beta-2 agonists: include substances that effect the adrenergic receptor in humans, increase insulin levels and stabilise breathing function. *Hormone and metabolic modulators: include drugs that effect the levels of oestrogen in both males and females. Such substances can prevent the conversion of testosterone into oestrogen and effect the levels of growth of these hormones in the human body. Due to the change on hormones, the use of these agents can also effect athletes metabolism. *Diuretics and masking agents: include drugs that have a diuretic effect on athletes allowing increased consumption of fluids that can aid the stimulation of red blood cells to prevent fatigue and mediate the effects of high blood pressure.  List of banned doping methods  Example of blood samples stored and later re- injected into players bodies to increase red blood cell levels. In addition to the publication of an official list of banned substances, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has published a list of banned practices that are considered acts of illegal doping within tennis. * Blood doping: includes the use of substances to increase red blood cell levels to regulate oxygen levels within the body, increasing athlete performance and recovery. Examples of blood doping include direct manipulation of the red blood cell count by injecting athletes with additional red blood cells and the retrieving and storing method that involves blood samples being collected, stored and then re-entered into the body once the cell count has returned to normal levels. * Chemical doping: involves the manipulation of blood and drug samples provided by athletes and intravenous injections except for acceptable hospital treatments. * Gene doping: is similar to blood doping in that additional genes are injected to an athletes body to increase performance. This can include the additional supply of the human growth hormone, insulin or cortisol regulators. While it is not recognised as a doping method, the un/intentional avoidance or missed drug test carried out by the ITF or other anti-doping body is also recognised as a type of doping offence. While the player may not have banned substances within their system, a missed test can result in a ban from professional competition of up to two years.  Controversies surrounding anti-doping policy  Anti-doping policy remains controversial due to the large amount of substances, ingredients and chemicals that athletes are prohibited from being exposed to. Controversy surrounds inadvertent cases of doping, such as those by Richard Gasquet (The Cocaine Kiss Controversy) and Maria Sharapova (long used drug added to the prohibited list without knowledge). While in both cases these players were ruled not to be at fault, the strict measures led to legal battle and damage to players reputation. Another controversy surrounding doping policy is the strict times at which testing can be carried out that players must hold themselves to or face potential repercussions, as seen with Viktor Troicki in 2013. The issue was raised by Serena Williams in 2018 when she was absent from an out-of- competition test that was conducted by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) outside the hours that were previously agreed upon by Williams and the organisation. Another issue raised by Williams is the inconsistency of testing. While the ITF, WADA and USADA use randomised testing with the consent of players, there is overlap with certain tests with Williams being tested five times before playing at Wimbledon in 2018 whereas other players had not been subject to the random, out-of-competition test.

Khalil's attention to intricate detail presented him with an opportunity to design Red Carpet gowns, which are now well known to be worn among celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Emily Ratajowski, and the Kardashian/Jenner family. While increasing his expertise, skills and understanding the bridal market over the course of his career, Khalil has gradually released bridal and red carpet collections since the beginning of his own business, including showing at 2019 Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week. Khalil's designs have expanded to an international scale, launching international stockists such as The Wedding Club, a luxury bridal wear store based in London, and is hoping to expand to Europe and Dubai. Due to his popularity in the US, Khalil opened a showroom in LA for celebrity stylists to access his gowns. A large part of Khalil's career centralises around fashion shows, domestically and internationally, which gives the ability for designers to showcase their work, increase clientele and generate a well branded name. Although Khalil is well regarded for his bridal and red carpet designs, in late 2017, he launched his own perfume for women, 'Steven Khalil Eau De Parfum'. Khalil created the perfume around the idea that the woman would have a special connection to the scent in conjunction to a special event, in particular, their wedding day.  Bridal, couture and red carpet launches  = 2014 Collection = Khalil created several bridal and red carpet pieces for the Fashion Palette Show 2014. This launch consisted of a range of couture gowns in neutral tones such as nude, white and gold, with statements of navy and aubergine. Khalil's inspiration for this collection was derived from the idea of all things 'Luxe' and metallic statements. Moreover, this collection utilised imported fabrics, such as Italian wool, silk and French lace. Khalil's favourite piece from this collection was known as the 'Warrior Gown', to which he described as a piece for an 'ultimate goddess gown for a strong women.' = 2015 Mercedes Benz Fashion Week = Steven Khalil's works have been appreciated and celebrated over the many years at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week, an international fashion week that recognises notable designers. Khalil's 2015 collection consisted of feminine silhouettes, fitted suits and elegant embellishments, emanating a fairytale charm. The show opened with navy and metallic tones presented in fitted suits and luxurious sleek gowns. This was followed by bold yellows and corals, which complimented each other. Thereafter, Khalil's models closed the show with his signature white gowns, each consisting of intricate detail and design. His attention to colour palette, fabric, length and trail was indeed prominent in 2015's MBFW. = 2015/16 Ready to Wear Spring/Summer = The 2015/16 Ready to Wear Collection maintained simplicity, consisting of black pant suits, plunging neck lines, feathering, sequences and neutral tones, that similar to the 2014 collection. Hints of neon were also visible among the detailing of skirts. = 2017 Mercedes Benz Fashion Week = 2017 was a memorable year for Khalil, as he closed his fashion show with a $100,000 bridal couture piece. With eight months of planning and over 300 hours of handwork, the dress featured a mesh bodice and floor length veil, covering the entire width of the catwalks surface. Indeed, it received much attention from the press and buyers, specifically from Middle Eastern countries, however, Khalil stated that he would like to save it in his archiv = 2018/2019 Bridal Collection = Khalil's most recent collection exudes a romantic aura, hence its title, 'Romance Ultime'. The collection consists of French lace, custom beading, tulle and intricate embroidery. Khalil wanted to return the 'classic feminine bride' in this collection. 2019 Couture Collection Khalil showcased at the prestigious Haute Couture Paris Fashion Week in 2019.  Celebrities and royalty  227x227px Steven Khalil's bridal and red carpet designs have been worn by many high profile identities since the beginning of his business. His increase in clientele can be due to his international showrooms in the United States that have showcased his works, which have been caught by the eye of celebrities such as Kylie Jenner. Guliana Rancic, E News host, has also worn Khalil's gowns regularly at Red Carpet events such as the Oscars and the Grammys. Likewise, Australian celebrities such as Samantha Jade and Sonia Kruger have been seen frequently wearing Khalil's designs to red carpet events. Khalil's designs are also worn by several Australian celebrity brides. The list of brides includes Nicole Trunfio, Bianca Chetah, Zoe Stenmark, Nikki Phillips, Zoe Marshall, Rachael Finch, Erin McNaught, Storm Keating, Anna Heinrich and Tessa James. Anna Heinrich particularly received attention from media outlets due to great public interest about her wedding dress. She wore Khalil's new 'Romance Ultime' Collection, which featured intricate beading, detailing and floral designs. Khalil's designs have also gained the attention from royalty. Following the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week show in 2017, Khalil received an email from the Princess Olympia of Greece, who requested to wear a piece from THE MBFW show to her 21st birthday.  Bridal Wear Trends  Fashion shows, whether they're domestic or international, play a large role in exhibiting and categorising trends of the year. While bridal trends do not fluctuate too much, shows such as the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia is an integral part to the bridal wear industry, providing an avenue for Australian fashion designers to progress and demonstrate their range. = 2018 = Bridal wear trends and styles are continually evolving and adapting with time. 2018 consisted of a range of trends, especially after The Royal Wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. Named the 'Meghan Markle Effect', many bridal designers, including Steven Khalil were influenced by Markle's dress, which was simple, clean and minimalist. During some time before the Royal Wedding, a few Australian news articles and blogs, including the Sydney Morning Herald and 'Who' questioned and speculated if Khalil was going to be designing Markle's wedding dress. Additional bridal wear trends that have taken over the fashion landscape this year include 'Femme Florals'. This trend centralises around beading, lace detailing and soft colours, all of which Khalil has executed in his 2018/2019 Bridal Collection, 'Romance Ultime'. = 2017 = The trends and styles exhibited during Spring of 2017 certainly contrast from 2018 trends. 2017 consisted of plunging necklines, capes and off the shoulder designs. Certainly the most prominent trend was the 'Non-Wedding, Wedding Look', which is designed with the means to be compatible with any wedding style event, including the reception and the after party. Khalil is synonymous with this trend, especially in his Red Carpet designs which are seen to be worn by many celebrities during red carpet, wedding and like events. = 2016 = 2016's bridal fashion consisted of a range of styles, however, maintained a traditional aura. Designs such as feminine tuxedos, feathering, floral and deep necklines were most popular. Likewise, Khalil exhibited these trends in his 2015/2016 Ready to Wear Spring/Summer Collection. However, Khalil did step outside the trends slightly by including sequence and details of bright neon.  Other contributions  Alongside creating Bridal and Red Carpet pieces, in 2017, Khalil collaborated with PROJECT FUTURES, a project that aims to help women and young children who are in danger to human trafficking, slavery and sex exploitation in Australia and Cambodia. The partnership raised awareness of the heinous crimes against women and children by designing a t-shirt, and providing all of its profits to the Australian charity Project Futures. Such profits contribute access to shelter, food education, and to services such as medical and psychological treatment for those women and children who are exploited to such circumstances.

The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book The Tacit Dimension in 1966, but it was economist David Autor that named it as Polanyi's paradox in his 2014 research paper on ‚ÄúPolanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth‚Äù. Summarised in the slogan \\"We can know more than we can tell\\", Polanyi's paradox is mainly to explain the cognitive phenomenon that there exist many tasks which we, human beings, understand intuitively how to perform but cannot verbalize the rules or procedures behind it. This \\"self-ignorance\\" is common to many human activities, from driving a car in traffic to face recognition. As Polanyi argues, humans are relying on their tacit knowledge, which is difficult to adequately express by verbal means, when engaging these tasks. Polanyi's paradox has been widely considered a major obstacle in the fields of AI and automation, since the absence of consciously accessible knowledge creates tremendous difficulty in programming.  Origins  British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi regularly studied the causes behind human ability to acquire knowledge that they cannot explain through logical deduction. In his work The Tacit Dimension (1966), Polanyi explored the 'tacit' dimension to human knowledge and developed the concept of \\"tacit knowledge\\", as opposed to the term \\"explicit knowledge\\". Tacit knowledge can be defined as knowledge people learn from experiences and internalize unconsciously, which is therefore difficult to articulate and codify it in a tangible form. Explicit knowledge, the opposite of tacit knowledge, is knowledge that can be readily verbalized and formalized. Tacit knowledge is largely acquired through implicit learning, the process by which information is learned independently of the subjects' awareness. For example, native speakers tacitly acquire their language in early childhood without consciously studying specific grammar rules (explicit knowledge), but with extensive exposure to day-to-day communication. Besides, people can only limitedly transfer their tacit knowledge through close interactions (sharing experiences with one another or observing others' behaviors). A certain level of trust needs to be established between individuals to capture tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge comprises a range of conceptual and sensory information that is featured with strong personal subjectivity. It is implicitly reflected in human actions; as argued by Polanyi, \\"tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness\\". People's skills, experiences, insight, creativity and judgement all fall into this dimension. Tacit knowledge can also be described as know-how, distinguishing from know- that or facts. Before Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle published a paper in 1945 drawing the distinction between knowing-that (knowledge of proposition) and knowing- how. According to Ryle, this know-how knowledge is the instinctive and intrinsic knowledge ingrained in the individual's human capability. Since tacit knowledge cannot be stated in propositional or formal form, Polanyi concludes such inability in articulation in the slogan ‚ÄòWe can know more than we can tell‚Äô. Daily activities based on tacit knowledge include recognizing a face, driving a car, riding a bike, writing a persuasive paragraph, developing a hypothesis to explain a poorly understood phenomenon. Take facial recognition as an illustration: we can recognize our acquaintance's face out of a million others while we are not conscious about the knowledge of his face. It would be difficult for us to describe the precise arrangement of his eyes, nose and mouth, since we memorize the face unconsciously. As a prelude to The Tacit Dimension, in his book Personal Knowledge (1958), Polanyi claims that all knowing is personal, emphasizing the profound effects of personal feelings and commitments on the practice of science and knowledge. Arguing against the then dominant Empiricists view that minds and experiences are reducible to sense data and collections of rules, he advocates a post- positivist approach that recognizes human knowledge is often beyond their explicit expression. Any attempt to specify tacit knowing only leads to self- evident axioms that cannot tell us why we should accept them.  Implications  Polanyi's observation has deep implications in the AI field since the paradox he identified that \\"our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding\\" accounts for many of the challenges for computerization and automation over the past five decades. Automation requires high levels of exactness to inform the computer what is supposed to be done while tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed in a propositional form. Therefore, machines cannot provide successful outcomes in many cases: they have explicit knowledge (raw data) but nevertheless, do not know how to use such knowledge to understand the task as whole. This discrepancy between human reasoning and AI learning algorithms makes it difficult to automate tasks that demand common sense, flexibility, adaptability and judgment ‚Äî human intuitive knowledge. MIT economist David Autor is one of the leading sceptics who doubt the prospects for machine intelligence. Despite the exponential growth in computational resources and the relentless pace of automation since the 1990s, Autor argues, Polanyi's paradox impedes modern algorithms to replace human labor in a range of skilled jobs. The extent of machine substitution of human labor, therefore, has been overestimated by journalists and expert commentators. Although contemporary computer science strives for prevailing over Polanyi's paradox, the ever-changing, unstructured nature of some activities currently presents intimidating challenges for automation. Despite years of time and billions of investment spent on the development of self-driving cars and cleaning robots, these machine learning systems continue to struggle with their low adaptability and interpretability, from self-driving cars' inability to make an unexpected detour to cleaning robots' vulnerability to unmonitored pets or kids. Instead, to let self-driving cars function optimally, we have to change current road infrastructure significantly, minimizing the need for human capabilities in the whole driving process. The increasing occupational polarisation in the past few decades ‚Äîthe growth of both high-paid, high-skill abstract jobs and lower-paid, low-skill manual jobs ‚Äî has been a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox. According to Autor, there are two types of tasks proven stubbornly challenging for artificial intelligence (AI): abstract tasks that require problem-solving capabilities, intuition, creativity and persuasion on the one hand, and manual tasks demanding situational adaptability, visual recognition, language understanding, and in-person interactions on the other. Abstract tasks are characteristic of professional, managerial, and technical occupations, while service and laborer occupations involve many manual tasks (e.g. cleaning, lifting and throwing). These jobs tend to be complemented by machines rather than substituted. By contrast, as the price of computing power declines, computers extensively substitute for routine tasks that can be codified into clear sets of instructions, resulting in a dramatical decline in employment of routine task-¬≠intensive jobs. This polarization has resulted in a shrinking middle class across industrialized economies since many middle- income occupations in sales, office and administrative work and repetitive production work are task-¬≠intensive. Moreover, the subsequent growth in income inequality and wealth disparity has recently emerged as a major socio-economic issue in developed countries.  Criticism  Some technological optimists argue that recent advances in machine learning have overcome Polanyi's paradox. Instead of relying on programmer‚Äôs algorithms to instruct them in human knowledge, computer systems are now able to learn tacit rules from context, abundant data, and applied statistics on their own. Since machines can infer the tacit knowledge that human beings draw upon from examples without human assistance, they are no longer limited by those rules tacitly applied but not explicitly understood by humans. Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1 AlphaGo program built by the Google subsidiary DeepMind is a great example of how advances in AI have allowed mindless machines to perform tasks based on tacit knowledge outstandingly. In the 2016 tournament of the strategy game Go, DeepMind's AlphaGo program successfully defeated one of the world's top GO players, Lee Se-dol, four games to one. DeepMind team employed an approach known as deep learning to build human-type judgment into AI systems; therefore, they can figure out complex winning strategies by seeing vast examples of Go matches. On the other hand, as Carr argues, the assumption that computers need to be able to reproduce tacit knowledge applied by humans to perform complicated tasks is essentially doubtable. When performing demanding tasks, it is not necessary for systems and machines to reflect the rules that human beings follow at all. The requirement is to replicate our outcomes for practical purposes, rather than our means. Jerry Kaplan, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert, also illustrates this point in his book Humans Need Not Apply by discussing four resources and capabilities required to accomplish any given task: awareness, energy, reasoning and means. Humans' biological system (the brain-body complex) naturally integrates all these four properties, while in the electronic domain machines nowadays are given these abilities by accelerating developments in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems. For example, sensory data provided by a wide network of sensors enable AI to perceive various aspects of the environment and respond instantly in chaotic and complex real-world situations (awareness); orders and signals for actuating devices can be centralised and managed in server clusters or on the 'cloud' (reasoning). Kaplan's argument directly supports the proposition that Polanyi's paradox can no longer impede further levels of automation, whether in performing routine jobs or manual jobs. As Kaplan puts it, \\"Automation is blind to the colour of your collar.\\" One example confirms Kaplan's argument is the introduction of Cloud AutoML, an automated system that could help every business design AI software, by Google Brain AI research group in 2017. The learning algorithms of AutoML automates the process of building machine-learning models that can take on a particular task, aiming to democratize AI to the largest possible community of developers and businesses. According to Google‚Äôs CEO, Cloud AutoML has taken over some of the work of programmers (which is, in the words of Autor, \\"abstract task\\") and thereby offered one solution to the shortage in machine-learning experts.  Related theories  = Moravec's paradox = Moravec‚Äôs paradox is very closed related to Polanyi's paradox, which claims that compared with sophisticated tasks demanding high-level reasoning, it is harder for computers to master low-level physical and cognitive skills that are natural and easy for humans to perform. Examples include natural language processing and dextrous physical movements (e.g. running over rough terrain). Robotics experts have, accordingly, found it difficult to automate the skills of even the least- trained manual worker, since these jobs require perception and mobility (tacit knowledge). In the words of the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker from his book The Language Instinct, \\"The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.\\" Corresponding to David Autor's discussion on jobs polarization, Pinker maintains that the appearance of the new generation's intelligent machines would place stock analysts, petrochemical engineers and parole board members in danger of being replaced. Gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are, by contrast, currently secure. = Plato's Problem = Plato's Problem is the term given by Noam Chomsky to \\"the problem of explaining how we can know so much\\" given our limited experience. = Poverty of the stimulus (POS) = Poverty of the stimulus (POS) is the argument from linguistics that children are not exposed to rich enough data within their linguistic environments to acquire every feature of their language. = Meno‚Äôs Paradox = Meno‚Äôs Paradox can be formulated as follows: # If you know what you‚Äôre looking for, inquiry is unnecessary. # If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for, inquiry is impossible. # Therefore, inquiry is either unnecessary or impossible. There is within these arguments an implicit premise that either you know what you‚Äôre looking for or you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for. = The Learning Paradox = The Learning Paradox (Fodor 1980) holds that knowledge can either not be new, or not be learned. If new knowledge can be expressed in terms of old knowledge, it is not new. If it cannot be expressed in terms of old knowledge, it cannot be understood. Therefore, learning something genuinely novel is impossible and all essential structures must be present at birth.

The symptoms of post-adoption depression are common to symptoms of depression, and include changes in sleeping pattern and appetite, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, problems with concentration and restlessness, as well as suicidal thoughts. These symptoms are also similar to those of postpartum depression, which is a related syndrome. Postpartum depression, however, involves hormonal changes in pregnant woman, which are not present in women suffering from post-adoption depression. Despite this difference, there are still significant changes that new parents go through, even when the child is not biologically their own. These changes can have significant impacts on mental health. Post-adoption depression can also negatively impact the child. There is not an extensive amount of research available concerning post-adoption depression, however since the early 2000s practitioners have begun to take an interest in the syndrome and its effects on new parents. [ref] Given that many of the symptoms of post-adoption depression, as well as prescribed treatments, are similar to those of postpartum depression, much of the research on postpartum depression are applicable to post adoption depression.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of post-adoption depression often come out around one month post adoption. * Anxiety * Changes in appetite * Fatigue * Feeling hopeless * Concentration problems * Suicidal thoughts Post-adoption depression can affect mothers and fathers, with them feeling inadequate or the adoption not meeting their expectations.  Causes  The cause of post-adoption depression has not been indefinitely specified, however, research has shown the development of depression in adoptive parents often is not due to personal or family mental health history, but linked to stresses in the environment and adjustments in parents lifestyle in relation to adoption. It was found rates of depression in parents post-adoption correlated highly with the change in sleeping pattern and lack of sleep, the restlessness of the child and any health problems present, for example colic. Causes of post-adoption depression include the lifestyle changes that come with adopting a baby, like lack of sleep, mental and physical exhaustion, as well as medical or psychological problems which is common in adoptive children. Other factors that can stress adoptive parents include potential financial strain for the family and evaluation for parental fitness, both of which can contribute to the likelihood of developing post- adoption depression. A correlation was found between a decline in mental and physical health post-adoption and the weakening in the parents relationship. Conversely, women with mental and physical support from their partner and have intimate relations are found to be more stable in their mental health. = Stress related to adoption = Adoptive parents face many changes in their lives and daily routines after adoption, which can affect the parents state of mental health. These would include the parental evaluation first time adoptive parents face, possible financial strain as well as the reminder of infertility and therefore possible feelings of guilt or inadequacy. New parents also encounter other stresses that are not due to the adoption process specifically, like lack of sleep or the physical exhaustion suffered from caring for a young child. = Relationship with partner = The relationship between the adoptive parents may be under some sort of strain during the adoption period, which can contribute to developing post-adoption depression syndrome. Both the maintenance of the relationship physically and mentally, as well as the support from the partner and their enthusiasm for being an adoptive parent have effects on mental health. = Demographics of adoptive parents = Data shows 81% of adoptive parents are 35-44 years old, and that women who have attempted to become pregnant with medical assistance are ten times more likely to adopt. As well as this, profiles made about cases of adoption have shown adoptive parents generally have a higher level of education and have more financial resources available to them. Therefore, their personal expectations of the adoption process are often not met, and the very lengthy procedure can make the parents feel as though they have no control over the situation. This can change the focus of the adoption to the process itself, and not the parenting and therefore not able to fully prepare for raising the child.  Diagnosis  Although there are no tests specific to identifying post adoption depression disorder, there are ways of identifying depression as well as postpartum depression which can be applied to situations in which post adoption depression may be present. = Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms = A method of diagnosing depression in which the patient rates their symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, appetite changes, suicidal thoughts and other symptoms on a scale of 1-5. This scale can assist the diagnosis of post adoption depression through the prevalence of the symptoms and the relation to the current life status. = Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) = A questionnaire was designed for adoptive parents to evaluate and report how they have been feeling in the past seven days in response to ten questions in relation to emotions, anxiety, sleeping behaviours, and general happiness. A study that modified this scale and had one hundred and twelve mothers fill out this modified questionnaire. From this, it was concluded sixty eight mothers were suffering from post adoption depression. It was also found this was not due to family history or personal medical history, but majority of the cases were associated with stress and other changes in day-to-day life of adoptive mothers.  Pre-adoption services  Having post-adoption services available to adoptive parents, like family counseling and information sessions is vital in developing parents understanding of issues relating to the adoption process and ultimately attempt to form a close bond between families. If parents adopt and do not gain the appropriate knowledge to sustain a successful adoption, they could miss vital signs of previous mental or physical abuse which may be thought of as behavioural issues. Cases of adoption where the adoptee has gone though mental or physical trauma can lessen the likelihood of a successful adoption if the parents are not adequately qualified to identify signs and follow through with any help the child may need. These issues could lead to frustration and stress for the parents and therefore not meet their expectations of adoption.  Post-adoption services  Although there are many services available to adults before they adopt, there are very few services for parents after they have adopted. Many the services provided for families post adoption are dedicated to special cases of adoption for example for children with special needs. Adoption involving people linked to the family, a relative or step-parent tend to cause fewer problems as being close to the family and children can set-up expectations accordingly. For children adopted into families that are unrelated, and do not have children, there is potential for more problems to come about as there is a more drastic change in the parents and adoptees' lives, and therefore being more difficult to adapt to these changes. In terms of older children, there is a greater level of disruption in the adoption, thought to be due to the greater difficulty they face when adapting to their new situation. As well as this, there is a greater possibility older children were subjected to forms of abuse and neglect and therefore potentially feel less open to the idea of embracing a new home environment.  Effects of post-adoption depression on the adoptee  Post- adoption depression effects often has a significant impact on mother or fathers parenting. This can lead to behavioural problems in the child, significantly due to the lack of attention the infant received, especially when compared to a child to the attentiveness of a mother with more stable mental health. = Cognitive development = Due to interactions with parents being insensitive and insufficient attention have been shown to leave to poorer cognitive function. This leads to lower performance on learning tasks, which is added to buy the likelihood of a depressed mother being significantly less likely to provide stimulants to their children. = Behavioural development = A significant amount of an infants day is traditionally spent with the mother or father, and the lack of mood control displayed by the parents can lead to problems for the child in terms of internalising and externalising problems. These issues lead to children feeling more depressed and expressing destructive and aggressive behaviours. It has been proven these children are more inclined to develop psychopathology. = Academic development = A correlation has been found between parents with mental health issues and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There are also links with these children requiring special education as well as experiencing difficulties in mathematics as well as problems with attention.

It is located at 456 Kent Street, Sydney NSW 2000, at the back of Sydney Town Hall. It is also an official building of City of Sydney Council and the service centre of Town Hall. Town Hall House is famous for its Brutalist architectural style. The building is an important example of Brutalism, which refers to the Modern Movement design. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Town Hall House is expected to be protected by the local council despite ongoing urban development. History Sydney Council approves the identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who are the traditional keepers of Australian land. Sydney is in the area which belonged to the Gadigal people, part of the Eora Nation. Their territory ranged from present-day Sydney Harbour to Petersham, including the land area of Town Hall House. The Gadigal people were dispossessed when Europeans arrived on Australian shores in 1788, and the area of New South Wales, particularly modern-day Sydney, and the rest of the continent became a colony of Britain. The land on which Town Hall House was built originally belonged to Francis Lascelles Wallace, according to 1833 survey plans map of Sydney. It was still a private building at the back of Old Burial Grounds (the area of Sydney Town Hall today), as shown of the map of 1855 Sydney. On the 1880 planning map of Sydney, this area (454 - 456 Kent Street) had changed to Goulburn Hotel and the old burial grounds lay next to Sydney Town Hall. The location was chosen to be a power station to supply electricity by Major Cardew, a famous trade expert, on March 22, 1900. From 1949, the land was used for the Simmonds Building and Council offices. At that time, council staffs were distributed in various offices across the city, which led to inconvenience with the increasing demand of council services. The new building was completed in 1973 and allowed all council staff to work together. Town Hall House is a reconstructed building based on the original architecture, and replaced an old building housing Sydney County Council's Electricity Department and a sales showroom on Druitt Street (the side entrance of Town Hall House). Side entrance at Druitt Street Architecture Town Hall House was designed by Ken Woolley of the firm Ancher, Mortlock and Woolley, rebuilt and opened and on 28 June 1977 for City of Sydney Council. It is constructed using concrete with little decoration, which matches to its Brutalist style, and is an example of early 70s' Brutalism. The Heritage Council of New South Wales said that Town Hall House is an example of the most important architecture from the modernist architectural movement in the 20th century. The angular geometry of Town Hall House is an element of this style of architecture. In terms of structure, Town Hall House is connected to the Sydney Town Hall by a passage. The two buildings form a contrast between the architectural styles of the 19th and 20th centuries. In addition, the buildings were constructed using different materials‚Äîconcrete for Town Hall House and sandstone for the town hall.) There are some people who feel that Brutalist-style buildings are ugly. Town Hall House is tall, with 25 levels. The building has developed into a combination of official area and leisure space. It provides a cafe and display area in the public space. There is a library express on the first level. Cameron Logan, who is director of heritage conservation in the Faculty of Architecture, Design, and Planning at the University of Sydney, feels although some people view modernist architecture as \\"an attack on the civic decorum of the city\\" or \\"just plain ugly\\", it has gained greater acceptance. \\"I think what is fundamentally important, and has often been missed, is that many buildings of this period had a strong civic intent and presence, and Town Hall House is an excellent example.\\" He added: \\"We need to reimagine or redefine our past in terms of city-making, it can't be a dead letter, fixed idea.\\" The main special characters of the original architecture were kept. An example is a curved stairway between the first two floors restored to its original Brutalist sculptural form, with the detailed brass and stone. =Interior= The interior of the public areas of Town Hall House was refurbished by Smart Design Studio in 2015 with recommendations from Tom Woolley, the building's architect. Another company, Built, also completed the refurbishment of Town Hall House in 2015, including Levels 1, 2, 3, and the roof. The interior fit out of the building meets NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating System) and Green Star ratings level. The building is a combination of historic elements and modern design. The exterior of the building kept the Brutalist style, but modern design is used within the building. Briefly, there are lifts straight after accessing the main gate. On the left side, there is a cafe, library and a side entrance. There are also tender boxes and a concierge on the ground floor to assist people in booking tours and providing several basic services for the building occupants. In addition, City Council is on the second floor. There are several other functional areas including the Town Hall Customer Service Centre (Level 2) and City Model Room and Meeting Rooms (Level 4). Sydney Town Hall customer service is located on the 2nd level of the building. The City Model Room is a model- sized display of the city of Sydney on the 2nd level of Town Hall House. The city model was arranged according to the buildings' actual positions. The model was built initially in the 1980s but is upgraded continuously to reflect the changes with developments in the city. The model gives people a direct view of what the city looks like and shows its development over the past three decades. It assists with planning and designing for the future, which is one of the roles of City of Sydney Council. There are two meeting rooms on Level 4, the Marconi Room and the southern Function Room. The rooms are connected to Sydney Town Hall by a glass passage to Marconi Terrace. It is the link between Sydney Town Hall and Town Hall House. In the terrace, there is a large stainless steel and glass sculpture designed by Mike Kitching installed in 1976. It shows the development of the radio industry and is a commemoration of the centenary of Guglielmo Marconi's birth. The sculpture connects the radio transmitter, mast, and wave to a Morse Code transmitter and receiver. Occupants =City of Sydney= Town Hall House, Sydney is the main administrative center for the City of Sydney.

It studies the social interactions between a person and society as well as the social patterns between societies, groups, nations, institutions, etc. Sociologists research the relationships between social structures and human lives. They also aim to solve the corresponding social issues revealed from the researches. Sociology in Japan emerged during the Meiji Revolution (1868) and developed with the establishment of the first chair of Sociology at Tokyo University in 1893. It has been integrated into the educational system of Japan as a result of modernisation and has been largely influenced by Western sociology.  Origin  Takebe Tongo, Chair of Sociology at Tokyo University The general recognition of sociology in Japan can be dated to the Meiji Revolution of 1868. At that time, the revolution influenced the modernisation progress of Japan and created changes to both the social and political structures of the nation. The sociology of Herbert Spencer was first introduced to Japan with the arrival of Ernest Fenollosa, a visiting professor of philosophy and political economy at Tokyo University. This and the subsequent creation of the first Chair of Sociology lead by Toyama Sh≈çichi are milestones in establishing Japanese Sociology. Takebe Tongo was the first Chair of Sociology at Tokyo University, which was then called the Tokyo Imperial University. His work of General Principles of Sociology (1905‚Äì1908) was the first systematic work on sociology in Japan and imposed great influence on the study's future development.  Development  The development of sociology in Japan can be generally categorised into four stages based on the various social, cultural structures and national policies at different stages of time. = Stage 1: Pre-World War II (1878‚Äì1945) = Japanese sociology at its initial stage focused primarily on philosophical orientations and was largely influenced by sociological theories from Europe. Sociology was first taught at Tokyo University in 1878 by Fenollosa, who was at that time a visiting professor of philosophy and political economy. Three years later, he was accompanied by Masakazu Toyama, who afterwards became the first official sociology professor in Japan and was awarded the title of \\"The Founder of Japanese Sociology\\". Both Fenollosa and Masakazu were promoters of Herbert Spencer's sociological theory which made Spencer's works significantly important to Japanese Sociology in the early years. Other Western sociological theories were introduced to Japan during the late 1900s and early 1910s, including those by Ryukichi Endo, Emile Durkheim and Franklin Giddings. The Japan Institute of Sociology was established in 1913 by Tongo Takebe and was replaced by the Japan Sociological Society in 1924. Until World War II, sociology study in Japan was largely influenced by Western theories and in particular the German School. = Stage 2: Post-World War II (1946‚Äì1960s) = The second stage of the development of Japanese sociology was symbolised by a transition of emphasis from philosophical orientations to empirical orientations. The American School of sociology studies cast great influence upon the development of Japanese Sociology during this stage of time. Social and political reform took place with the US occupation of Japan at the end of WWII. The traditional Japanese value system collapsed and the new idea of democratisation emerged. Sociology came into the public vision with the revision of values. During the 1950s, as part of educational system reform, sociology formally became a required subject of general studies in tertiary education in Japan. An increasing number of sociologists were needed with more sociology departments and progress established. American sociological theories started to gain attention during this fast-developing period of Japanese sociology. The US occupation helped the spread of American sociological theories in Japan. At that point of time, the American sociologists were particularly emphasizing empirical studies and this ultimately led to the same transition towards empirical research methods in Japanese sociology. Two of the leading Japanese sociologist at that time were Tadashi Fukutake and Kunio Odaka. While they researched in different fields, Fukutake studying in rural sociology and Odaka studying in industrial sociology, they were both leading empirical sociologists conducting a large number of researched-based surveys. = Stage 3: Diversification (1960s‚Äì1990s) = The third stage of development of Japanese Sociology started during the 1960s. This stage of development is characterised by its various emphasis of studies. Both empirical orientation as well as philosophical and theoretical orientation were popular among the Japanese sociologists. Changes in social structures were witnessed by the senior sociologists during the post-war stage. Yet these senior sociologists mainly belonged to a pre-war academic circle. Younger Japanese sociologists during this period tend to focus more on theoretical micro-sociological analysis than the macro analysis. Multi-dimensional paradigms started to grain attention within Japanese sociology, including those of Alfred Schutz, Anthony Giddens, J√ºrgen Habermas, and Pierre Bourdieu. The American influence and empirical approach continued to develop in Japanese sociology which consequently contributed to the rising of many new and diverse topics of study. This stage saw the emergence of leading scholars including Eiichi Isomura in urban sociology, Kiyomi Morioka in the religion and family sociology, Akira Takahashi in social movements, Joji Watanuki in political sociology, and Tamito Yoshida in social communication. The diversification was later accelerated by other social factors such as industrialisation in the 1970s and environmental and feminist movements in the 1980s. From this point onwards, sociology in Japan continued to grow at a remarkable rate. By the 1980s, the number of sociologists teaching at colleges reached about 1,000 and the number of members of the Japan Sociological Society increased up to 3,034 in 1999. = Stage 4: Globalisation (1990s‚Äìpresent) = The fourth stage of development of Japanese sociology began from the 1990s. From then until the present times, there has been a movement toward theoretical and empirical orientations, with increasing international and foreign studies as well as cooperation with global communities. Research conducted in 1998 by the Japan Sociologist Society examined the preferred field of research of its members. The top 10 preferred fields were: *15.6% chose general sociological theories *15.2% chose sociology of the family *15.1% chose communications and information *14.7% chose social thought and the history of sociology *14.3% chose social welfare, social security, and medical sociology *13.6% chose culture, religion, and morality *13.1% chose social psychology and social attitudes *12.2% chose rural sociology and community studies *11.3% chose cross-national and foreign area studies The same study was conducted ten years earlier in 1988. The difference in the results obtained showed that industry, labour, and educational problems had lost popularity ‚Äì whereas communications, information, psychology and foreign studies gained attention during the 1990s. The general trend of globalisation of the nation is responsible for such transition of popular study fields. While the language barrier and a lack of coordination with foreign research institutions have made the Japanese Sociologists Society lack a reputation in other parts of the world, globalisation has created an increasing number of opportunities for Japanese sociologists to study abroad and welcomed foreign corporations and coordination. Sociology in Japan became more internationalised during this stage of development  Social problems in Japan  In a perfectly harmonious society, sociologists research the patterns and rules of social interactions and relations. However, such studies are not enough in contemporary societies as social problems exists. Research findings are necessarily used to further aid the investigations of existing and emerging social problems. In 1985, the Japanese Association for The Study of Social Problems was established, and brought increasing attention to the topic. Several major social problems are introduced and explained below. = Juvenile crime = More concerns have been placed on criminal news reports in recent times in Japan, especially on juvenile crime. In 1997, an incident involving a severed head being hanged on the gate of a junior high school was widely reported in media, attracting attention from the community. It was found to be committed by a 15-year-old boy and the crime shocked Japanese society. Youth bullying has come to the attention of sociologists and juvenile crime has been a social problem. = Discrimination = The caste system has a significant influence on Japanese history. During the 260 years of Tokugawa period, the caste system ranked the Japanese population according to their occupation with warrior being the highest, followed by peasants, craftsman, and merchants. Outcasts, people with occupation beneath merchants, were deemed to be not respectable in the community. In 1868, the Meiji Revolution established the rule of equality as a social discipline and laws have been created since then. However, although the influence of the caste system has been diminished, discrimination remains and has become a social problem. = Suicide = From research statistics obtained during 1975‚Äì1988, on average about twice the number of deaths in car accidents results from suicide in Japan with the peak number reaching 23,832 deaths in 1987. At that time, however, suicide was not recognised as significant as the car accident deaths. As the social problem of suicide gained increasing attention, sociologists emphasised that suicide cannot be considered alone and apart from law, morality and other social factors. Problems such as depopulation is largely influenced by the issue of suicide. = Ageing population = Japanese population chart The population of Japan is expected to decrease by one-third during the next fifty years with about 40% of the remaining population being over 64 years old, a trend of the aging of Japan. Financial burden and caring responsibilities are increasing for the future working generations. At the same time, a crisis is faced by Japanese universities as the young population shrinks. The number of 18-year-old people was expected to decrease from 2,050,000 in 1992 to 1,200,000 in 2007 and continue downwards. In 2000, sixty percent of the colleges were already unable to recruit enough students. The ageing population situation has created various social problems.  Further reading  * W., H.

It first aired on Cartoon Network on January 5, 2018 as the second half of a two-part special, immediately following the preceding episode, \\"Lars of the Stars\\". It was directed by Joe Johnston and Liz Artinian and written and storyboarded by Miki Brewster and Jeff Liu. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Short- Form Animation. In this episode, Stevonnie, the fusion of protagonist Steven and his best friend Connie, is stranded on the moon of an alien planet. While there, they have a dream involving a memory of the Diamonds, the leaders of the tyrannical Gem Homeworld. The dream gives the viewer their first look at Pink Diamond, who Steven has been told was assassinated by his mother Rose Quartz millennia ago. Plot As the episode begins, Stevonnie (AJ Michalka) has just won a battle to defend the starship commanded by Steven's friend Lars (Matthew Moy), disabling the enemy's ship; but Stevonnie's spacecraft is damaged. Out of control, it crash-lands on the alien moon below and explodes. Stevonnie is unharmed, protected by Steven's magic bubble, and begins to explore their surroundings. In the sky above hangs the planet that the moon orbits; its surface is riddled with huge cavities, as if the planet's mass has been eaten away. They find their spacecraft's radio, but it is too damaged to contact Lars. As they begin to panic, they are attacked by an insect-like alien creature; they fight it off and resolve to survive until Lars can find them. They forage for food and encounter strange plant and animal life. They camp in a cave, cook their food over a campfire, and shave with the blade of their sword. As they contemplate killing a small bird-like creature for food, the creature's parent attacks them. They escape it by fleeing into an ancient, abandoned tower. That night, they make their camp in the tower and go to sleep. Stevonnie dreams of being in Connie's home, where Connie's mother (Mary Elizabeth McGlynn) towers over them, scolding someone on the telephone. As Stevonnie attempts to get her attention, it gradually becomes clear that Connie's mother is reenacting the role of Yellow Diamond in an ancient conversation, directing the Gem colonization of a planet. Stevonnie begins playing the role of Pink Diamond, petulantly interfering with Yellow's work and demanding an army and a planet to colonize of her own. When Pink insists, \\"I'm just as important as you!\\", Yellow retorts, \\"Then why don't you act like it, Pink?\\" Pink storms off and breaks a window in frustration; her reflection in the glass is the viewer's (and Stevonnie's) first look at Pink Diamond's face. Stevonnie awakens and, exploring the tower further, realizes that it was the site of the conversation in their dream and, like the similar tower on Earth's moon, the headquarters of Gem colonization of the broken planet above. They find the window that Pink Diamond punched, still broken. Stevonnie is able to activate the tower's computer, remembering the activation code from having seen it in the dream, and uses it to contact Lars. Just as the large bird-like creature tries to break into the tower, Lars arrives in his starship and frightens the creature off. As Stevonnie prepares to return to Lars so he can send them home, they contemplate the broken window. Production This episode was written and storyboarded by Miki Brewster and Jeff Liu; it was Brewster's first turn as a storyboard artist for the show. The episode was directed by Liz Artinian (art director) and Joe Johnston (supervising director). According to Johnston, the idea of setting an episode on a planet covered with strange vegetation was inspired by a visit to the Huntington Desert Garden near Los Angeles. Since Steven and Connie spend the entire episode fused, this is the only episode of the series not to feature Zach Callison as the voice of Steven. Broadcast and reception \\"Jungle Moon\\" was broadcast on Cartoon Network on January 5, 2018, as the second half of a two- episode special. It and the preceding episode, \\"Lars of the Stars\\", were promoted under the joint title \\"Stranded\\". The \\"Stranded\\" broadcast received a Nielsen rating of 0.34, and was seen by approximately 1.1 million viewers. The episode was favorably received by critics. The Mary Sue's Vrai Kaiser praised both AJ Michalka's performance of Stevonnie, and the execution and implications of the dream sequence. The A.V. Club's Eric Thurm agreed, giving the episode a rating of A‚Äì; he especially singled out Michalka's ability to portray both Steven's and Connie's elements of Stevonnie's personality. Several critics, including Kaiser and Thurm, drew attention to the scene in which Stevonnie grows stubble and shaves, noting its effectiveness in communicating Stevonnie's complex, non-binary gender. Mey Rude at Autostraddle noted that Stevonnie in this episode provided positive representation for non- binary viewers, as a non-binary character with a positive attitude about their body. The episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Form Animated Program in 2018. Although it did not win that award, background painter Patrick Bryson won a juried Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation for his work on this episode.https://www.emmys.com/shows/steven-universe References Steven Universe episodes 2018 American television episodes ","title":"Jungle Moon"},{"id":"58397658","text":"Lebetimonas natsushimae is a moderately thermophilic, strictly anaerobic and chemoautotrophic bacterium from the genus of Lebetimonas which has been isolated from a hydrothermal vent from the Mid-Okinawa Trough.

Although Aesthetics did not exist as a field of study during the Middle Ages, influential thinkers active during the period did discuss the nature of beauty and thus an understanding of medieval aesthetics can be obtained from their writings. Medieval aesthetics is characterized by its synthesis of Classical and Christian conceptions of beauty. The thought of Aristotle and Plato, framed by that of the Neoplatonist Plotinus, placed an emphasis on concepts such as harmony, light, and symbolism. By contrast, readings of the Bible inspired an interrogation of the relationship between nature and the divine. The writings of St Augustine and Pseudo-Dionysius integrated Plato and Plotinus with early Church Doctrine, while St Thomas Aquinas incorporated Aristotelian philosophy into his discussion of beauty in nature. The theological concerns of these writers meant that their aesthetic theories were relatively neglected post-Enlightenment, but their influence had been extensive, especially during the Renaissance. In recent times, the works of Spanish director Luis Bu√±uel have been inspired by medieval theories of beauty.  Historiography  Aesthetics as a distinct philosophical branch did not exist during the Middle Ages. Medieval aesthetics as a subject comprises studies of key medieval thinkers by modern writers such as Umberto Eco and Edgar de Bruyne. That medieval philosophies of beauty are implicit rather than explicit is in part due to the fact that the broader philosophical mentality of the period was highly traditional and that 'innovation came without fanfare'. For Eco, his historical approach is evident in his belief that aesthetics must be viewed as 'the ways in which a given epoch solved for itself aesthetic problems as they presented themselves at the time to the sensibilities and culture of its people'.  Origins  Medieval aesthetics largely derive from the writings of Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus, when viewed through the lens of medieval Biblical exegesis. = The Bible = Aesthetic consideration of the material world comes mainly from the Old Testament. According to Tatarkiewicz, the importation of the Greek concept of kalos into Christian thought during the translation of the Hebrew into the Greek meant that the passage in Genesis, 'And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very beautiful,' emphasised the aesthetic qualities of creation. This sentiment was similarly translated into the Book of Wisdom which advances the mathematical nature of aesthetics and aligns the work of both God and humanity through their common manipulation of these mathematical qualities in order to create beauty. = Plato = In the Symposium the notion of the beautiful soul is introduced as more valuable than material beauty. Beauty is therefore aligned with the Good and this definition makes it compatible with Christian spirituality. Plato's theory of the forms underlies much of the writings of St Augustine and Pseudo-Dionysius. The theory refers to the way in which material objects are merely the reflection or attempt at representation of a perfect, abstract reality. Within Plato's framework, these pure forms of reality are determined by a demiurge, but the Christian interpretation of Plato by Augustine and Dionysius holds that the forms mirror the perfection of God's own mind. This notion underlies the more significant notion of mimesis, whereby art and material beauty are considered the mere reflection of the beauty of that realm. = Aristotle = Aristotle followed Plato's approach in the Hippias Major and the Gorgias, positing the inferiority of smell, taste and touch by connecting aesthetic experience with the higher sensations of sight and sound. In Poetics he established some grounds for the medieval argument that the beautiful can be equated with the good as 'he believed a tragedy could cleanse negative emotions such as fear and pity'. = Plotinus = Plotinus is notable for his writings about beauty, which form a substantial part of what has come to be known as Neoplatonism. Plotinus particularly influenced medieval aesthetics by expanding the notion of beauty so that it was not exclusively conceived in terms of symmetry.  Key thinkers  = St Augustine = St Augustine, c. 1645-1650, by Philippe de Champaigne. The aesthetics of St Augustine are less theological than that of subsequent thinkers due in part to his earlier life as a pagan. His conversion to Christianity allowed Augustine to implant Christianity with Classical ideals, whilst innovating Platonic and Ciceronian ideas with Christian belief. Augustine's notion of beauty's objective existence is one of his most fundamental ideas. He writes that beauty is objective and that this objectivity is external to humans, who can contemplate beauty without having created it. Augustine wrote that something 'pleases because it is beautiful'. He highlighted that beauty is, in and of itself, an indispensable aspect of creation; it is inherently harmonious and its existence aligns with humanity's deepest, but 'proper' desires because measure, form and order make something good. In his work, On Music, Augustine asserts that beauty is the unity of disparate parts, such as lines, colours and sounds. Augustine also expanded the Roman notion of number in rhythm to beauty more generally by regarding rhythm as the sole source of beauty. According to Augustine, every experience of beauty originates in and is determined by rhythm. Even though he placed heavy emphasis on the beauty of number and therefore equality or balance, he also realised the purpose of contrast or the inequality of parts. For example, he attributed the beauty of the world to the contrast between things and therefore he believed the correct and natural placement of things results in beauty. = Pseudo-Dionysius = St Thomas Aquinas, 1476, by Carlo Crivelli. Pseudo-Dionysius developed the Classical notion that the beautiful is aligned with the good by writing that beauty is the manifestation of goodness. He justified this assumption through his idea that God is the Cause of everything, meaning that beauty and the beautiful are the same because they have the same cause. He asserted that all things have beauty because everything originates in the Cause and that this means nothing can lose its beauty. For Pseudo-Dionysius there exists an Absolute Beauty from which all material beauty is derived through 'emanation'. This results in the earthly encounter with beauty that is divine, even though it may appear imperfect. Such a conception, according to Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, is important because medieval aesthetics were thereafter 'fundamentally based on [his] brief treatment of the Beautiful' in On the Divine Names. This treatment also involved the important step of using 'Beauty' as a divine name. According to Brendan Thomas Sammon, this approach influenced how St Thomas Aquinas came to treat beauty. = St Thomas Aquinas = St Thomas Aquinas gave two individualised definitions of beauty in the Summa Theologica. The first asserts that the beautiful is experienced through visual pleasure, while the second states that the beautiful is a pleasurable perception. These amount to a single definition of beauty that accounts for both subjective and objective experiences of beauty where the emphasis on sight and perception creates a holistic groundwork for understanding beauty. His most historically important idea regarding aesthetics was that the beautiful is pleasurable, while not all pleasures are beautiful. Unlike his predecessor Pseudo-Dionysius, who started his aesthetics from the assumption of an absolute and divine beauty, Aquinas took material beauty subject to empiricism as his starting point. In departing from the Platonic transcendent, Aquinas moved towards Aristotelianism which enabled the exploration of the beautiful and the good as independent of each other. This move thus enabled Aquinas to develop an implicit criteria for beauty: actuality, proportion, radiance and wholeness.  Proportion  Due to the enduring legacy of the Pythagoreans and Boethius' De Musica, musical principles of proportion were applied to the arts more generally, but with prominence in music and architecture. This gave rise to the re-appropriation of the Pythagorean notion musica mundana whereby the beauty of the world was viewed as a harmonious interaction of contrasts, namely that between macrocosm and microcosm. Proportion was considered an aspect of reality because it was 'not a product of the human mind, nor an invention of the musician'. The work of bishop and philosopher, Robert Grosseteste, embodied these assumptions as it used mathematics to explore harmony as a condition of beauty, such as in his belief that the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 were the source of musical principles. According to Umberto Eco, Medieval conceptions of beauty were based on the earlier Classical attempt to link mathematics with beauty: '[This conception of beauty's] many variations are reducible to the one fundamental principle of unity in variety.' These aesthetics also had a moral dimension borrowed from Pythagoras, for whom, for instance, certain musical proportions were believed to lead to sins. Musical principles were often enacted into architecture so that buildings would be built according to an 'order reminiscent of a musical melody'. For this reason, architects were frequently called 'composers' who created beautiful buildings according to a 'divine arrangement' whereby correct proportions of latitude, longitude and altitude harmonised. Cathedrals exemplify construction according to these principles, and theology also informed the sense of proportion so that 'from an aerial viewpoint [they] were in the shape of a cross,' which created a sense of 'balance when viewed from within the cathedral'. As pointed out by both Charles Rufus Morey and Charles S. Baldwin, cathedrals embody the elision of theology and aesthetics. Robert Grosseteste whose work influenced Medieval thought on proportion and light.  Light  A systematic aesthetics of light began to appear in the thirteenth century. Light was believed to endow physical objects with nobility and beauty because it 'constitut[ed] the essence of colour and at the same [was] the external condition of its visibility,' according to Edgar De Bruyne. The medieval concern with light was constant throughout aesthetics because it extended the Neoplatonist notion that light was emanation by placing it within an Aristotelian cosmology and asserting that it was the emanation of God. This idea is to be found particularly in the work of Pseudo-Dionysius where the sun symbolises the eternity of light and therefore the constancy of beauty. Robert Grosseteste's On Light is an example of the movement during the Middle Ages of trying to understand light in terms of beauty. One of the thirteenth century scholastics, Grosseteste helped to develop a 'metaphysics of light', whereby it was believed that the world was formed by the presence of light, with the straight rays of the sun impressing orderliness on its surface. Light was considered to be intrinsically connected to heat, which was reflected in the belief that male beauty comprised a 'fresh and rosy, halfway between pale and flushed' complexion, which was influenced by the soul's warming of the blood because the soul had properties of light. De Bruyne also points to the contemporary focus on rare stones and metals as evincing the aesthetics of light, because the Latin etymologies of the French for bronze, gold and silver reflect a belief that they were made of illuminated air and that this was the source of the beauty.  Symbolism  J. Huizinga points to the importance of symbolism during the Middle Ages as a way of comprehending the purpose of existence and therefore, it is key to understanding the medieval paradigm. Aesthetics were underlaid by theological and philosophical principles because the base assumption of the era was that God created everything in His likeness, meaning that aspects of His being could be perceived through a symbolic view of the world. For this reason, art did not explicitly depict the transcendentals of truth and beauty because symbolism was instead considered the closest way to apprehending 'traces' of the transcendentals in creation. Representational art was imbued with symbolism because this was a solution to balancing the notion that truth was grounded in natural observation against the attempt to depict the spiritual world, which was considered inherently different to reality and thus required idealisation without distorting truth. As outlined by Tatartkiewicz, architecture was heavily founded upon notions of symbolism based on numbers with 'five doors symboli[sing] the five wise virgins, and twelve columns the twelve apostles. Pulpits were supported by eleven columns, symbolising the eleven apostles who were present at the Descent of the Holy Ghost, and the ciborium on ten columns symbolises the apostles who were not present at the Crucifixion'. Churches evinced considerable symbolism, which is particularly noticeable in Eastern churches where the writing of Pseudo-Dionysius enjoyed considerable attention, with his notion of emanation allowing churches to be viewed as extension of God. Edessa Cathedral, for instance, was built so that light entered it through three windows with three facades in order to symbolise the Holy Trinity, whilst the roof represented the sky.

Education and Early Career Matias del Campo graduated from the University of Applied Arts Vienna in 2003, receiving a Master of Architecture with distinction. His ideology is a reflexion of the explorations he manifests towards contemporary tendencies, representing an alloy between ‚Äúmaterialization protocols in nature, cutting- edge technologies and philosophical inquiry which together form a comprehensive design ecology‚Äù. During his tenure within the Hans Hollein studio at University of Applied Arts Vienna, he was first introduced to Computational Design, being one of the students chosen by Hollein to learn programming in UNIX and test 3D modeling packages. SPAN In 2003, alongside architect Sandra Manninger, he started the architectural practice SPAN, a bureau with offices in Vienna and Shanghai, and one of the first offices to focus on computational design in Vienna. The practice is currently developing projects in Jakarta, Malaysia, Wuhan, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shanghai, China. Initially, the practice started gaining a reputation in Vienna for its radically advanced projects, becoming supported by the Architecture Centre Vienna, which showcased their work and commissioned the bureau with exhibition designs and for the remodeling of the center's headquarters, and won an award from the Austrian Experimental Architecture awards. The studio thinks of architecture as a process. SPAN started gaining international recognition in 2010, when the architects won the competition for the Austrian Pavilion within the Shanghai World Expo, as well as the newest Brancusi Museum in Paris, France. In 2011, Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna invited SPAN to conduct a solo show in their gallery, other architecture practices invited to the exhibition series include Greg Lynn, Asymptote, FOA, and Lebbeus Woods. Now a widely, internationally recognized practice, SPAN's work was featured at the 2012 Venice Architecture Biennale, at ArchiLab 2013 at the FRAC Centre, Orl√©ans, France, the 2008 and 2010 Architecture Biennale in Beijing, and in the 2011 solo show ‚ÄòFormations‚Äô at the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna. Most recently, SPAN's work was highlighted in a solo exhibit at the Fab Union Gallery in Shanghai China. The practice is known for actively practicing in building design and at the same time elaborating the theoretical and discoursive base for novel developments. All projects are conceptualized as vehicles of exploration. Teaching Matias del Campo currently teaches as an Associate Professor of Architecture within the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan. He has also been a Lecturer within the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Design Philadelphia, and a Guest Professor at the Dessau Institute of Architecture, Germany. Research, writing and lectures In 2015, Matias del Campo received the Accelerate@CERN fellowship Award Research award, courtesy of the Swiss CERN Institute, a one-month artist residency within CERN, aimed to artists which are spending for the first time within a science laboratory. Together with Sandra Manninger, the two architects spent the month of May 2016 within the Institute, their research being true to that of SPAN philosophy, aiming to ‚Äúgo beyond beautiful data to discover something that could be defined voluptuous data. This coagulation of numbers, algorithms, procedures and programs uses the forces of thriving nature and, passing through the calculation of a multi-core processor, knits them with human desire.‚Äù Matias del Campo has been a guest editor for Next Generation Building, by TU Delft, in March 2016, and in November 2016 for the AD Magazine in London, UK. His newest book premiered on the 22nd of March 2017, entitled Sublime Bodies, Architectural Problems in the Postdigital Age, published by Tokyo University Press, Shanghai, and is featured both in Chinese and English. He has contributed to many publications in the field of Computational Design, such as Marjan Colletti's Digital Poetics (Ashgate 2013) or Mark Burry's Scripting Culture: Architectural Design and Programming (Wiley 2011). In 2016, del Campo was Technical Chair of the ACADIA conference Material Frontiers 2 - Synthetic Biologies, curating and moderating the discussion.

It was developed as an indigenous alternative to the imported Daimler-Benz DB 605 that was being built under licence as the Fiat RA.1050 R.C.58 Tifone. The engine was essentially two Gamma V12 engines on a single crankshaft, but proved troublesome to develop and never entered production. Background During the 1930s, Isotta Fraschini had developed a line of air cooled inverted V12 aircraft engines including the Gamma. These proved moderately successful at a time when most Italian aircraft engines were radials, including Isotta Fraschini‚Äôs own K.14.Gunston, 2006, p.107 In 1939, the Italian air ministry, looking for an appropriate power plant for their next generation of fighter aircraft, approached Germany to license the Daimler-Benz DB 605. An inverted V12 like the Isotta Fraschini designs, it differed in its liquid cooling but also in its capability, being over twice as powerful as the Italian engines. To compete with this, and other foreign designs like the Rolls-Royce Merlin, Isotta Fraschini developed the Zeta.Ceruschi, 2003, p.41 Design and development =Design= The Zeta was, in essence, two Gamma R.C.15 V-12 engines coupled to a single crankshaft. The engine consisted of an aluminium crankcase with four cylinder banks, each mounted at 90 degrees, with six cylinders. Each cylinder had a single intake and exhaust valve, driven by dual camshafts, and two spark plugs.Pearce, 2017 The whole engine was designed to be fitted as a replaceable power pack. =Development= Isotta Fraschini was owned by Caproni, who also produced aircraft, including the Caproni Vizzola F.4 which was originally planned to have an Isotta Fraschini V-12 engine but flew with a Daimler-Benz DB 601. The company also developed the Caproni Vizzola F.6 derived from this design, powered by the more powerful Daimler- Benz DB 605. On 7 October 1941, the design of a version of the F.6, named F.6Z, to be powered by the new Zeta was instigated, the first aircraft being ordered on 16 June 1942.Brotzu, Caso, Cosolo 1971, p. 29 In October 1942, Reggiane, also owned by Caproni, was also tasked by the Air Ministry to develop a version of their Reggiane Re.2005 with the new engine. Seven examples of the proposed Reggiane Re.2004 were ordered.Brotzu, Caso, Cosolo 1972, p. 30 However, engine development was proving difficult; the first Zeta R.C.45 was run on 28 February 1941,rated at , but would only develop , as well as having many other issues. Resolving these took time and when the more powerful Zeta RC24/60 was run in May 1943, it still failed its type test. Reggiane tested a mock-up in a wind tunnel and mounted it in the nose of a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 but cooling problems continued to hold development back.Alegi, 2001, p.35 It was not until 14 August 1943 that the first engine took to the air in a Caproni Vizzola F.6Z, nearly two years after the Daimler- Benz-powered F.6M.Brotzu, Caso, Cosolo 1971, p. 30 Further development ceased following the armistice on 8 September 1943.

Jebi formed from a tropical disturbance south-southwest of Wake Island on August 26 and became the twenty-first named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season on August 27. Amid favorable environmental conditions, Jebi quickly strengthened into a typhoon on August 29 as it headed west and later rapidly intensified as it passed the Northern Mariana Islands on August 30. Subsequently, Jebi reached its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent typhoon on August 31, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), and a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). Afterwards, Jebi began a slow weakening trend as it turned northwest, briefly passing through the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September 2. Jebi accelerated north-northeast on September 3 as it interacted with the westerlies, before making landfalls over Shikoku and then the Kansai region of Japan early on September 4. Jebi quickly weakened over land and became an extratropical cyclone later that day over the Sea of Japan. The remnants of Jebi moved over the Russian Far East before dissipating on September 7. Jebi passed north of the Northern Mariana Islands as an intensifying typhoon on August 31, bringing minor flooding. Heavy swells produced by Jebi caused large waves along the coast of Taiwan that resulted in at least six fatalities from September 2 to 3. In Japan, significant impacts occurred across the Kansai region. The typhoon's powerful winds, which broke wind records at 100 Japanese weather stations, damaged nearly 98,000 houses and left nearly 3 million customers without electricity after blowing down power lines. Heavy rains combined with the winds to damage buildings and infrastructure, including several shrines and historical buildings. Agricultural damage from the adverse weather conditions were also significant, with losses from the agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries valued at almost JP¬•47 billion (US$430 million). Fruits were blown off trees, crops were lodged, and power outages affected the storage of livestock and produce. Storm surge flooded over 700 houses and inundated part of Kansai International Airport, which, combined with wind and rain damage to the terminals, forced the airport to close from September 4 to 13. The typhoon also cut off access to the airport by blowing a tanker into the bridge connecting the airport to the mainland; repairs to the bridge were completed seven months later. In total, 14 people were killed in Japan, mostly from falls and flying debris, and 980 were injured. Insured losses reached JP¬•1.6 trillion (US$13‚Äì14 billion). Meteorological history A tropical disturbance was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on August 26 about 1,020 km (635 mi) south-southwest of Wake Island. The disturbance increased in organization over the next few hours, with rainbands wrapping into a developing low-level circulation center. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 26, with the JTWC following suit at 06:00 UTC the next day. Further development was expected as the depression tracked northwest around a subtropical ridge, with high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear ahead in the system's anticipated path. The JMA deemed the cyclone to have attained tropical storm status at 18:00 UTC on August 27 and assigned it the name Jebi; the JTWC similarly upgraded the system six hours later. With favorable winds aloft aiding the development of thunderstorm activity, Jebi continued to strengthen as it turned more westward under the influence of the subtropical ridge. The JMA upgraded Jebi to a severe tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on August 28 as its maximum sustained winds increased to 95 km/h (60 mph). Amid the favorable environment, Jebi began to intensify more quickly on August 29, reaching typhoon status at 06:00 UTC as it developed an eye feature visible on microwave satellite imagery. Rapid intensification commenced later that day, as a central dense overcast blossomed over the system's center. From August 29 to 30, Jebi's satellite presentation swiftly improved as its eye cleared out and contracted to a diameter of 19 km (12 mi), while convection surrounding the eye deepened. The JTWC analyzed that Jebi intensified into a super typhoon by 18:00 UTC on August 30 with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), representing an increase of 95 km/h (60 mph) in the past 24 hours. The JMA reported that Jebi reached its peak intensity at 00:00 UTC on August 31 with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a central pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg); the JTWC estimated that Jebi's winds continued to increase and peaked at 285 km/h (180 mph) at 06:00 UTC. Jebi on September 3, a day before landfall in Japan Jebi's intensity leveled off thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle began, with the original eyewall encircled by a larger second eyewall. The cycle completed by 21:00 UTC on August 31 while Jebi began to curve northward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge. However, drier air then began to impinge on the southern portion on the circulation, resulting in continued weakening. At the same time, upper-level winds pushed subsiding air over the western part of Jebi's circulation, causing its convection to warm. As a result, the JTWC assessed that Jebi had weakened below super typhoon status by 18:00 UTC on September 1. Travelling northwestwards, Jebi entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 06:00 UTC on September 2 and received the local name Maymay; Jebi exited the PAR roughly 12 hours later. Slow weakening continued through September 3 as dry air and subsidence continued to affect Jebi's circulation. Despite this, Jebi managed to maintain a ragged yet well-defined eye. Later on September 3, an extratropical cyclone approaching from the northwest began to accelerate Jebi north-northeast, while interaction with the midlatitude westerlies caused Jebi to begin extratropical transition. Racing poleward, Jebi made landfall over southern Tokushima Prefecture at around 03:00 UTC on September 4, possessing winds of around 155 km/h (100 mph). In the next two hours, Jebi crossed Osaka Bay and made another landfall around 05:00 UTC near Kobe, Hy≈çgo Prefecture. Land interaction and increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the system as it crossed Japan, with the JTWC declaring that Jebi was no longer a tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC on September 4, just hours after it entered the Sea of Japan. The JMA downgraded Jebi to a severe tropical storm at 18:00 UTC, before later declaring it post-tropical at 00:00 UTC on September 5 just offshore Terneysky District, Russia. Over the next two days, the remnants of Jebi headed generally north over the Russian Far East while gradually weakening, crossing the 60th parallel north before the JMA ceased tracking the system at 06:00 UTC on September 7. Effects =Northern Mariana Islands= As Jebi passed just north of the Northern Mariana Islands as an intensifying typhoon on August 31, a typhoon warning was issued for the islands of Agrihan, Alamagan, and Pagan. A high surf advisory and small craft advisory were issued for Saipan and Tinian as heavy swells affected the islands. The small size of the typhoon's inner core, however, meant that damage in Agrihan, Alamagan, and Pagan was limited to minor flooding. =Taiwan= Typhoon Jebi brought large waves to the east coast of Taiwan on September 2 and 3 when it recurved northward east of the Ryukyu Islands. On September 2, at Mystery Beach in Nan'ao Township, Yilan County, five people riding all-terrain vehicles were swept out to sea. Four were confirmed to have drowned when their bodies were recovered and the fifth person was listed as missing. Another death also occurred at Neipi Beach in Su'ao Township when a passerby rescued an eight-year-old girl but drowned himself. One more death occurred at Neipi Beach on September 3 when a woman was swept out to sea, however this was suspected to be a suicide. Following the incidents, Mystery Beach was closed to the public from September 5 to 14. =Japan= The torii of the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, damaged by fallen trees Typhoon Jebi was the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall on Japan since Typhoon Yancy in 1993, causing significant damage in the Kansai region. Fourteen people were killed across the country and 46 others were seriously injured, while another 934 people received minor injuries. The typhoon's strong winds damaged 97,910 houses, of which 68 collapsed and 833 suffered major damage, while heavy rains and storm surge flooded another 707 houses. Another 6,527 buildings were damaged. Insured losses were estimated at over JP¬•1.6 trillion (US$13‚Äì14 billion), placing Jebi as the costliest typhoon to hit Japan. Ahead of the storm, emergency evacuation orders were issued for parts of Osaka, Hy≈çgo, Nara, Wakayama, and Kagawa prefectures. Evacuation advisories were also issued for Ishikawa, Fukui, Yamanashi, Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Kyoto, Okayama, Tokushima, and Kochi prefectures. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that in total, about 8,000 residents evacuated to 1,667 shelters in 24 prefectures. In Osaka, department stores and other commercial facilities were closed. Public schools were closed in the cities of Kobe, Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka, as well as in Wakayama Prefecture. Several tourist attractions were closed to visitors, including Universal Studios Japan, the Kyoto City Zoo, the Kyoto Aquarium, Nij≈ç Castle, and the Kyoto Imperial Palace. JR-West suspended operations in the Keihanshin region on September 4. Services along the T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen, as well as the San'y≈ç Shinkansen between Shin-≈åsaka and Hiroshima stations, were also halted on September 4. At least 912 flights in and out of Osaka were cancelled. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a trip to Kyushu to oversee state response efforts. Jebi set new records for 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 53 weather stations and broke records for wind gusts at 100 weather stations in Japan, mostly on September 4. The highest sustained winds from Jebi were recorded at Cape Muroto, at . At Kansai International Airport, a gust of was recorded, which was significantly higher than the previous record set by Typhoon Cimaron just 12 days earlier. Significant winds occurred even in urban areas, with downtown Wakayama experiencing maximum sustained winds of up to and gusts reaching . Similarly, the financial center of Osaka, Ch≈´≈ç-ku, recorded a maximum gust of . Jebi also produced a maximum storm surge of in Osaka, surpassing the previous record of from the 2nd Muroto Typhoon (Typhoon Nancy) in 1961. Collapsed scaffolding in Osaka near Higobashi Station Across the Kansai Region, massive blackouts occurred as the typhoon blew down transmission lines, with over 2.2 million customers of Kansai Electric Power Company losing power. Restoration works were fully completed only on September 20, having been hampered by fallen trees, collapsed houses, and landslides. Other significant power outages were reported in the Ch≈´bu region, with Chubu Electric Power reporting 695,320 blackouts. Elsewhere, 16,040 households in the Hokuriku region lost power, and another 14,000 households in the T≈çhoku region were left without power. Numerous incidents resulted from Jebi's high winds and heavy rain. In Shiga Prefecture, a man died after the warehouse he was working in collapsed. A man in Osaka was blown off the second floor of a house and fell to his death; at least five more people in the eponymous prefecture were killed by falls or flying debris. Another man died after he fell from a roof in Mie Prefecture. Part of the glass ceiling at Ky≈çto Station collapsed, injuring multiple people. Fallen trees trapped 160 elementary school students on a school trip in Kyoto. At the Nintendo headquarters in Kyoto, the logo on the exterior of the building was damaged by strong winds. The LED lighting on the Ts≈´tenkaku tower in Osaka was damaged by flying debris and made inoperable. An oil refinery in Sakai operated by JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy was forced to partially shut after a cooling tower sustained damage. In Nishinomiya, 187 cars caught fire at an auctioneer's lot after their electrical systems were short-circuited by storm surge. Several shrines across Japan were damaged: the Kasuga Grand Shrine in Nara had its arrival hall damaged by fallen trees, the torii at the entrance of Oji Shrine in Tokyo collapsed, while the torii on the east side of the in Matsumoto, Nagano was destroyed. One of the three honden of in Shiojiri, Nagano, which were built in 1672, was severely damaged by a fallen tree. The hall of worship at Hirano Shrine in Kyoto, which was constructed in 794, was destroyed by the typhoon. Part of the cliff on the south side of Ueda Castle collapsed, while an iron roof tile was blown off at the Katakurakan building in Suwa, Nagano. The trunk of a 400-year-old beech tree in the Shirakami-Sanchi was snapped by Jebi's strong winds. Damage to the Kansai International Airport Access Bridge, viewed from the bridge on September 9 Kansai International Airport was forced to close on September 4, as waves reaching in height overtopped coastal defenses and left a runway and cargo facilities inundated. Access to the island was cut off on September 4 when a 2,591-tonne tanker was unmoored by Jebi's strong winds and collided with the only bridge connecting the airport to the mainland. As a result, 8,000 passengers and staff were stranded in the airport and were evacuated by ferries and speedboats on September 5. The 11 crewmembers on board the tanker were uninjured and were rescued by the coast guard. The terminals experienced power outages, leaving passengers to wait without air conditioning. A passenger sustained minor injuries from a window broken by the storm. Partial operation of the airport resumed on September 6, with flights allowed to operate out of the undamaged Terminal 2. Other flights were redirected to nearby Itami and Kobe Airports. Terminal 1 began to resume operations on September 13 and the previously flooded runway reopened on September 14. The airport reopened fully on September 21, following repairs to an electric power facility and a baggage claim area at Terminal 1. Repairs to the access bridge continued and were completed in April 2019. The agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries suffered significantly, with damage amounting to JP¬•46.81 billion (US$427.4 million) across 33 prefectures. A total of of cropland was damaged by the typhoon's strong winds, which blew down fruit trees and caused lodging of vegetable and feed crops. About JP¬•11.88 billion (US$108.5 million) worth of crops were lost. Across 31 prefectures, 42,918 incidents of damage to agricultural infrastructure were reported, resulting in JP¬•20.10 billion (US$183.5 million) of damage. Around 131 fishing boats and 406 aquaculture facilities were also damaged. In the T≈çkai region, some pigs suffocated after power outages stopped ventilation of the stalls they were kept in. In T≈çhoku and Hokkaido, many apple farms suffered from apple scab after the typhoon, exacerbating losses. Production of persimmons in Wakayama Prefecture‚ÄîJapan's leading persimmon exporter‚Äîdeclined by at least 10 percent. At an aquaculture facility off Kushimoto, Wakayama, run by Kindai University, 600 bluefin tuna were lost after the cage containing them broke, resulting in losses of JP¬•100 million (US$913,000). Extended power outages prevented farmers from shipping raw milk in at least five prefectures. Jebi served to worsen damage inflicted by Typhoon Cimaron, which passed over roughly the same areas two weeks earlier.

The plant could degrade the land to the extent where it could no longer be used for pastoral farming and could have a detrimental effect on stock.Beinart and Wotshela, 2003. 'Prickly pear in the Eastern Cape since the 1950s', pp.190 In addition, the plant was seen to have a negative effect on availability of labour as it ‚Äúallowed blacks and poor whites to elude wage labour for half the year by harvesting and selling the fruit crop‚Äù, and the alcohol made from it was seen to make people ‚Äúunfit for labour‚Äù.Van Sittert, 2002. ‚ÄòOur irrepressible fellow-colonist‚Äô, p.404 In addition, it was believed that thieves and vagrants could hide in the plants and live on their fruit.Ibid Eradication The above factors led some farmers to put pressure on the colonial administration to fund and make compulsory the eradication of the plant.Ibid The administration did not, however, because of objections from other farmers and the economic cost of such a project.Ibid, p.407 They did decided to subsidise or fund farmers with arsenic to get rid of prickly pear on farmland.

'Biological control of prickly pear',p.29 It is largely due to this that, in 2002, there was a tenth of the number of prickly pear left when compared with the 1930s.Ibid, p.31 Opinions on the prickly pear today H.G. Zimmerman and V. C. Moran argue that, today, permission for such control would not have been given.Ibid, p.33 This is because, with the plant largely under control, public perception of it has, by-and-large been positive.

He graduated from the L'√âcole d'Administration des Affaires in Lille in 1959 and attended the Managerial Economics Seminar at the University of California, Berkeley in 1961. In 1967, he received a PhD in engineering from the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.  IESE Business School  Fernando Pereira was a key figure in the founding of IESE Business School, alongside Antonio Valero Vicente. In 1958, he moved to Barcelona and formed part of the founding team, which also included F√©lix Huerta Herrero, Anton Wurster, Rafael Termes, Juan Ferr√°n Nadal and Carlos Cavall√©.Pampliega Nogu√©s, Javier (2012). ‚ÄúLa historia del IESE: Una gran Business School en Pedralbes.

With Valero, he travelled to numerous educational institutions around Europe to get a firsthand perspective of the best practices in business education. During their visit to the L'√âcole d'Administration des Affaires in Lille, it was decided that Pereira would stay there to finish his teacher training.Valero Vicente, Antonio (2001). ‚ÄúLos comienzos del IESE: el impulso del Beato Josemar√≠a.‚Äù Anuario de Historia de la Iglesia X: 759-771.

Madrid: LID. p. 118. . In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Pereira actively promoted and developed research at IESE, serving as the university's research director (1959-1964) as well as its director of executive education programs. After serving on the board of directors, he was named the school's dean (1970-1978), succeeding Juan Ginebra Torra.La Vanguardia Espa√±ola (September 17, 1970) ‚ÄúRelevo acad√©mico en el IESE.

His tenure saw the flourishing of the Harvard-IESE Committee and the launch of the IAE Business School in Buenos Aires, which would later become part of the Universidad Austral. He also contributed to the creation of the Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci√≥n de Empresa (IPADE), which eventually formed part of the Universidad Panamericana de M√©xico. Another milestone in his leadership was the opening of the IESE campus in Madrid in 1974, in order to promote training for business leaders and executives in the Spanish capital. Under his direction, the alumni association grew into a vibrant source of support and advice, and a means of continued contact between current and former students, faculty and academic leadership.Actualidad Econ√≥mica (September 30, 1978) ‚ÄúLos empresarios estudian. Veinte a√±os del IESE‚Äù, pp.64-66. In 1978, for health reasons, he was replaced as IESE's dean by Juan Antonio P√©rez L√≥pez, but remained on the board of directors (1978-1981). Later, he served as associate dean under Pedro Nueno (1981-1992). An avid reader, he was a great connoisseur of English authors such as G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, R. Knox and H. Newman.  Professor of Accounting  Pereira was a professor of accounting and financial management at IESE for decades, both in the MBA and the executive education programs. In 2001, he was named professor emeritus. As a professor, he had a gift for making complex accounting principles accessible and engaging, able to captivate a full classroom with his rhetorical questions and sense of humor. His book \\"Accounting for Management\\" is a classic among accounting textbooks. In the prologue, he gives some basic advice for solving complicated problems: > ¬´Complex problems are solved with the help of a pencil, an eraser and a > sheet of paper‚Äù The book is aimed at anyone who is not a professional accountant but who requires a knowledge of accounting. While highly practical, it is also academically rigorous, thanks to the author's experience in the private sector and as a professor.La Vanguardia (March 25, 1971) ‚ÄúContabilidad para Direcci√≥n‚Äù p. 12  Publications  = Books = * Pereira, F.

It is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean around eastern Australian and northern New Zealand. Description Girella elevata has a moderately deep, compressed oval shaped body with a narrow caudal peduncle and a small head which has a slightly bulging forehead. It has a small mouth which does not extend as far as the eye. Each jaw is equipped with a two rows of teeth, an outer row of flattened three-crowned teeth which do not overlap and an inner row of similar but much smaller teeth. It has ctenoid scales which cover much of the body and it has a continuous lateral line which is arched in parallel with the body's dorsal profile. The dorsal fin is continuous and there is almost no difference in form between the spiny and rayed parts of the dorsal fin. The spiny part is about a third longer than the rayed portion. The spines become longer towards the trail and the soft rays are noticeably longer than the spines. The soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin is rounded. The anal fin is similar in shape to and lies opposite to the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin. It has a very large and deeply forked caudal fin It has small pectoral fins in which the upper rays are the longest and small pelvic fins, located below, and just to the rear of the base of the pectoral fins. The dorsal fin has 14-16 spines and 11-12 soft rays while the anal fin has three spines and 11-12 soft rays. It can reach a length of standard length and average weight of standard weight to standard weight, but can exceed . This species is uniformly blackish-brown to grey on their body with a black margin along the posterior edge of the operculum. The juveniles are less uniformly coloured, being more mottled, as the dark colour is broken by bands on the back. It can be confused with the silver drummer (Kyphosus sydneyanus). Distribution Girella elevata is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean in coastal eastern Australia and northern New Zealand. In Australia it occurs from Noosa Heads, Queensland south to Apollo Bay in Victoria and northern Tasmania, although it is rare west of Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. It is also found around Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea. Habitat and biology Girella elevata show a preference as adults for areas of rocky reef in exposed situations where they can be found from the surf zone down to around . They are frequently observed by divers in caves or below ledges. The juveniles occur in rockpools, estuaries and areas of rocky reef in shallow waters. This species may live as long as 45 years. It is omnivorous and feeds on a range of invertebrates and algae. Fisheries Girella elevata is a highly sought after target of recreational fishermen due to its reputation as a brutally tough fighter when hooked, said by some to have given rise to the angler's colloquial name of pig, although it has also been suggested that this stems from the sounds it makes when landed and its fine eating qualities. Because its preferred habitat is in the white-wash around rocky outcrops immediately along the coastal shoreline, most anglers targeting rock blackfish are land- based. Rock blackfish can also be caught from water craft, but this is considered a high-risk activity due to the dangers of fishing very close to shore. Because drummer inhabit the white-water in the washes and rocky outcrops on the coastal fringe, they are a relatively powerful fish for their size with a large tail fin that allows them to maneuver in that turbulent zone. The best times of day to fish for drummer are usually in the period approaching a high tide, and/or during low light periods such as dawn or dusk. Drummer also seem to be more active during rougher ocean conditions, although anglers must be especially vigilant for their safety when fishing during higher seas. To catch drummer, anglers firstly need to identify a location that is relatively safe to fish and appears likely to hold drummer, generally deeper water adjacent to a bombora. Fish are then attracted through the use of a bread-based berley stream. = Bait, tackle and rigs = Because rock blackfish are omnivorous, they will take a range of baits including cunjevoi, peeled prawn, bread and sea cabbage. Bait should be lightly weighted so it washes around in the white-water as realistically as possible. Anglers need to maintain contact with the bait or else risk it sinking too deep and likely becoming snagged on the rocks and kelp below. However if the bait is not allowed to sink far enough down it will not reach the drummer who often station themselves in overhangs and caves several meters/feet from the surface. This can be a frustrating method of fishing and takes practice. Rigs for drummer fishing are generally very simple, using a monofilament line around , and either using a running ball sinker rig (where a pea sized sinker is threaded on the line and sits freely directly above the hook), or suspending bait below a bobby cork. Strong hooks are required for this style of fishing.

It is the former spoil tip of the Judkins Quarry, which extracted granite in the area. Mount Judd is a famous local landmark and in 2018 was voted the United Kingdom's \\"best landmark\\" in a Daily Mirror poll. At 158 metres (518 feet) altitude it is the 3,306th highest hill in England.  History  There is some evidence of paleolithic inhabitation in the surrounding area, with some worked stones being found nearby dating from 60,000 years ago. There is some evidence that the area may have been used industrially by the Romans as some potential kiln sites have been identified. From the medieval period the site was largely used for agriculture. Quarrying of granite and the extraction of clay began on the site in the mid-18th century. The site was served by the Coventry Canal and the railways which later became the Trent Valley and Birmingham‚ÄìPeterborough lines. By the late 19th century brick, textiles and clothing factories occupied the site. The quarrying operation, known as Judkins Quarry, had expanded by the mid-20th century with large filter beds and a stone crushing plant in operation. Mount Judd was formed during this era as a conical-shaped spoil tip of unusable stone arising from the quarrying operation. Mount Judd is a local landmark, visible from miles around, and is also known as the \\"Nuneaton Nipple\\". This reflects the shape of the mount and may be a derogatory term applied by residents of nearby Bedworth. After the quarry closed the heap has become grassed over and became the 16,403rd highest peak in the British Isles and the 3,306th highest in England. Warwickshire County Council purchased the former quarry for use as a landfill and it became the largest such site in Nuneaton. This use came to an end in the summer of 2009 and the site was capped off. Part of the site remains in use as a council recycling centre. In May 2018 plans were submitted to construct 400 homes on land adjacent to the site.  Significance  Mount Judd is renowned locally and it was usual for youths to climb to the top, being described as a \\"rite of passage\\". The hill is privately owned and is fenced off, with access discouraged for health and safety reasons. In autumn 2017, half of a Mini car was placed on top of the hill as a prank. It was quickly removed but was noticed by many of the morning commuters on the nearby Tuttle Hill Road. In August 2018 the public were warned to stay away from the site and adjacent quarry as children as young as five had been spotted playing there near to 200-foot drops. Mount Judd was voted the United Kingdom's best landmark in a May 2018 poll by the Daily Mirror, beating competition from the Angel of the North and Stonehenge. A few weeks afterwards the Daily Mirror reopened the poll. The poll remains live as of 2020 with Mount Judd as the top landmark.

The current main building was built in 1833-35 for major-general Harald Rothe (1781-1848). It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1944. History Aggersvold traces its history back to the Middle Ages when its name was Navnet and it was located in the village of Marke. In 1581, Frederik Lange and his wife Dorthe Christoffersdatter Lindenov moved the manor to its current location, renaming it Aggersvold after a village, Agerup, which had formerly been located at the site. Their son, Gunde Lange, sold the estate to admiral Henrik Vind in 1630. Vind, who had served in the Kalmar War (1611‚Äì13) and Kejserkrigen (1625-29), died just 39 years old in 1733. His widow, Margrethe Pedersdatter Laxmand, who inherited the estate, married Joachim von Bredow 1641. Their daughter, Marie Margrethe von Bredow, sold Aggersvold in 1691. The new owner was Niels Benzon, a major landowner and president of work for the Danish Chancellery, who had been ennobled in 1780. After his death in 1708, Aggersvold was passed on to his son Jacob Benzon. Oeder Benzon, one of his brothers, acquired it in 1820 and a third brother, Lars Benzon, was the owner from 1733. Lars Benzon sold Aggersvold to Herman Leopoldus in 1737. He was later ennobled under the name L√∏venskiold. L√∏venskjold's son, Severin Leopoldus L√∏venskiold, sold it to Christian Lautrup in 1750. In 1753, Aggersvold was acquired by Peder Juel. He expanded the estate with land that had until then belonged to four farms in the village of H√∏ed. In 1760, he sold the estate to Laurits Switzer. Aggersvold in c. 1870 Christian Albrecht Lerche purchased Aggersvold in 1865. He did not live on the estate and the building gradually fell into disrepair while most of the tenant farms were sold to the tenant farmers. Lerche's widow sold it to Villars Knudsen Lunn . He expanded the forests significantly in around 1900. In 1915, Aggersvold was sold to a consortium. The intention was to sell the land off in lots but these plans were not realized. Thor Timm purchased Aggersvold in 1916. Some of the land was used for the creation of new smallholdings in the period between 1923 and 1942. He also established the farms Skyttehaven (1926) and Fruensfold (1930). Architecture The two-storey main building is built to a restrained Neoclassical design. The median risalit is decorated with pilasters and tipped by a triangular pediment. Monumental, Bornholmian sandstone staircases lead up to the main entrances on both sides of the building. The farm buildings, a three-winged complex surrounding a central courtyard, is located to the north of the main building.

The embassy serves large amounts of Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia. Other Indonesian diplomatic establishments in Malaysia include four consulate-generals in Johor Bahru, Kota Kinabalu (Sabah), Kuching (Serawak), and Penang, and a consulate in Tawau.  History  Before Malaysia became an independent state, Indonesia had already established a diplomatic mission in the form of a consulate in 1953. The head of the mission was Consul Mohammad Rasyid Manan (1953‚Äì1956). He became consul general when the mission became a consulate general as Malaysia neared its independence (1956‚Äì1957). After the establishment of Malaysia as a sovereign state, the Indonesian diplomatic mission became an embassy with Muhamad Razif (1957‚Äì1963) as the first Indonesian Ambassador to Malaysia. Diplomatic relations ceased on 17 September 1963 due to the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. The process of normalization of relations started with the signing of the Bangkok Accord between the foreign ministers of both countries on 1 June 1966 in Bangkok. The next meeting took place in Jakarta, which produced the Jakarta Accord on 11 August 1966. A further meeting took place in Kuala Lumpur on 14 September 1966. As a consequence, on September 1967 the Indonesian government established a liaison office in Kuala Lumpur that was headed by Benny Moerdani. Initially, the embassy was located in U-Thant Road, but it was relocated to an 8-story building at Tun Razak road, its present location, in 1977. The embassy has been a site for demonstrations, including ones related to haze and arrests of Malaysian fishermen.  Services  Aside from routine services, the embassy also has dedicated shelters for Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia who encountered difficulties. It also works with the Malaysian government to register otherwise illegal migrant workers. In 2017, under ambassador Rusdi Kirana, the embassy began offering 24-hour services.

They are best known for their YouTube channel which has over 12 million subscribers.  Early careers  Wingrove and Lynch have been described as \\"teenage rejects\\", having been rejected by the academies of professional football clubs in their youths before finding success as influencers and YouTube freestyle footballers. Wingrove comes from a footballing family, with his father Alan briefly playing in the youth set-ups of Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, and his cousin, Greg Lincoln, being part of the first team squad at Arsenal‚Äîthough Lincoln never actually played for the club. Wingrove had a trial for Tottenham Hotspur aged 11, but was told he was too small and therefore not physically strong enough to make it at professional level. He began performing freestyle football to earn money while continuing to pursue a footballing career, playing at youth level for Enfield Town and then semi- professionally for Ware from 2004 until 2009. Wingrove was the first professional freestyle footballer to sign for a Premier League club, signing for Tottenham Hotspur‚Äîwho had previously rejected him as a youngster‚Äîin 2003, for whom he would perform at half-time breaks and corporate events and occasionally fill in for first-team players in advertisements. As a teenager, Lynch played in Arsenal's Academy, but was later released by the club. Lynch claims to have been told \\"on the ball, you're the best at the whole club ... but off the ball, you're one of the worst\\", though some have expressed doubts over the veracity of this claim given the presence of players such as Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp in the Arsenal squad at the time. Lynch began learning freestyle skills and tricks in 2000 after watching a Nike commercial featuring Edgar Davids and Denilson Pereira Neves. After being rejected from the Arsenal academy, Lynch began performing freestyle football at a variety of events. He featured in the 2007 documentary film In the Hands of the Gods, and reached the semi-finals of Britain's Got Talent in 2008.  F2Freestylers  The F2 warming up at an event prior to the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final Eventually, Wingrove and Lynch decided to commit to making a career in freestyle football as a duo, realising they would have more success as a marketable pairing than attempting to pursuing careers as professional footballers. Together, the duo have been invited to perform at a number of high-profile footballing events, including the Ballon d'Or awards ceremony. They have featured in several charity football events, including Soccer Aid in 2018, where Lynch scored for the England side, and in 2019 in which Lynch scored twice, again for England. In 2017, the pair led a team of YouTubers and ex-professional footballers competing under the name Tekkers Town in the Wembley Cup against Hashtag United, and in 2018, they entered the competition as F2 FC, winning in the final against Rebel FC. = YouTube = Real Madrid's Rodrygo, filming a promotional video for FIFA 20 On 8 April 2011, the duo registered their YouTube channel, F2Freestylers, on which they publish freestyle videos and tutorials to showcase football skills and tricks, often featuring celebrities and professional footballers, as well as videos relating to the FIFA video game series. As of 18 May 2020, their YouTube channel has 12 million subscribers and 2.5 billion views. As well as earning money from YouTube's ad-revenue monetisation, Wingrove and Lynch's videos feature brand endorsements; previous sponsorship deals include Adidas and Carlsberg. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as ambassadors for Santander UK, Wingrove and Lynch produced a series of videos designed to improve numeracy and increase physical activity in line with UK curriculums for students unable to attend school during lockdown. In 2018, Wingrove and Lynch produced a YouTube original series, titled F2 Finding Football, which was streamed on YouTube Premium. The series, which features a number of celebrity guests, was well received and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for an Outstanding Travel and Adventure Program as well as two Streamy Awards. = Talent agencies = In 2018, Wingrove and Lynch established a football management agency, F2 Talent, despite neither being a licensed intermediary with the FA. The agency courted controversy over the use of a photo publicising a newly- signed young player, violating the FA's policy to not promote players under the age of 15. Also in 2018, the duo founded F2 Revolution, an agency aimed at recruiting 'social talent'.  Other ventures  Lynch signed a short-term semi-professional contract with Billericay Town in 2017, playing in the Isthmian Premier League. He registered his first goal for the club on 3 October 2017, scoring Billericay's fifth goal in a 6‚Äì1 win against Hungerford Town in the FA Cup. After being absent from the team for several matches in late 2017, the club revealed on Twitter that it had been agreed with Lynch that his work as part of the F2Freestylers would take priority over playing for Billericay. Lynch also posts short videos to his TikTok account, on which he has a following of over 3.9 million subscribers.

She then moved to Australia for ten years, where she was a Tutor in French at the University of Queensland while studying for her M.A. and Ph.D., both on French Surrealism. In 1971 she returned to the UK, and settled in Helston, Cornwall, in 1974, where she undertook tutoring in Twentieth-Century Poetry for the Open University and for the University of Exeter Extra-Mural programme, while writing and publishing her major works of poetry. She was appointed as Cornwall's first Writer in the Community in 1986, and was regularly invited to give Poetry Workshops and courses at the Arvon Foundation.

Her second major book, The Tenth Muse (1983) explores the relationship of women to writing, and \\"through its title, evokes a whole tradition of women's poetry\\". Shortly after its publication, she was involved in a lively feminist debate in the Letters pages of The Times Literary Supplement concerning a fictional \\"Hysterical Women's Movement\\" that many contemporary reviewers of women's writing appeared to believe in.Times Literary Supplement, 19 August 1983, p. 882. Her next collection, The Sea at the Door (1985) is described by one reviewer as \\"a haunted book ‚Äì haunted by past and present selves, none of them quite real\\", noting particularly the way in which she often engages intense erotic themes through the filter of imagination and dreams. Some of her work focuses on fraught relationships between men and women, together with an exploration of gender politics, notably News from the Front (1983), co-authored with the poet and novelist D. M. Thomas, in which each poet explores the conflictive relationship between a young Portuguese radical and a right-wing British businessman, with each sometimes adopting the feminine and sometimes the masculine persona.

A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Professor Telles has reoriented the field of Sociology beyond the U.S. black- white paradigm through his research and writings on color, race and ethnicity globally, particularly in Latin America and for Latinos in the United States.  About  Formerly a professor in the sociology departments at Princeton and the University of California at Los Angeles, Telles is a Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Telles is a leading figure in the study of race and ethnicity in the Americas and on immigrant integration, intergenerational change and mobility among Mexican Americans. His book Race in Another America and his work at the Ford Foundation in Rio de Janeiro were instrumental to changing discourse on race in Brazil and for producing major policy changes in Brazil, including instituting affirmative action in public universities. In the United States, Telles' research reveals how Mexican Americans have been incorporated in a largely distinct way from European Americans regarding education, socioeconomic status, language, culture, segregation and politics. By spanning the social sciences and the Americas in his research, Edward Telles has helped increase understanding of how race and inequality interact.\\"RACE IN ANOTHER AMERICA: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SKIN COLOR IN BRAZIL Princeton University Press, 2004 (Also available in Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese)  Research and publications  Focusing on race and ethnicity in Latin America, Telles' major books include Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil, published in 2004 by Princeton University Press, winner of several awards, including the Distinguished Publication Award from the American Sociological Association, and the Otis Dudley Duncan Award for the best book in social demography (2005), as well as the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for the Best Book from the Race and Ethnic Minorities section of the American Sociological Association (2006), the Best Book Award from the Brazil Section of the Latin American Studies Association (2006) and the Hubert Herring Award for the Best Book in Latin American Studies from the Pacific Council for Latin American Studies (2005). Telles is also the author of Pigmentocracies: Ethnicity, Race and Skin Color in Latin America (with the Project on Ethnicity and Race in Latin America (PERLA), an interdisciplinary, multinational team of scholars), published by the University of North Carolina Press in 2014. Both books are published in Spanish and Portuguese and the former is available in Japanese. Pigmentocracies was based on random-sample surveys of race and ethnicity in several Latin American countries and conducted in conjunction with an international team of social scientists (PERLA), which Telles led. He has also published in this area in leading social science journals including the American Journal of Sociology, the American Sociological Review, Social Forces, and Demography.nRegarding his work on Latinos in the United States, he is best known for the following. In 2008 Telles coauthored Generations of Exclusion, Mexican Americans, Assimilation and Race with UCLA sociologist Vilma Ortiz, which won the Otis Dudley Duncan Award (2009) and the Best Book Award from the Pacific Sociological Association (2009). That book is based on a longitudinal and intergenerational study of more than 1000 Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio, who were interviewed in 1965-66 and who were mostly reinterviewed in 2000 (as well as interviewing a sample of the children of the original respondents). His forthcoming book is Durable Ethnicity: Mexican Americans and the Ethnic Core from Oxford University Press, which he co-authored with Christina Sue  Reception  About Race in Another America, writing in the Journal of Social History, George Reid Andrews noted: \\"This is a blockbuster of a book. To a topic ‚Äî Brazilian race relations ‚Äî historically fraught with ambiguity, uncertainty, and disagreement, it brings clarity, logic, and lucidity, not to mention several truckloads of data. The result is the most important work on race in Brazil since Gilberto Freyre's seminal The Masters and the Slaves (1933)‚Ä¶The clarity and lucidity of Telles‚Äôs findings, and the wealth of data on which they are based, make this book a genuine tour de force, and the most illuminating examination of Brazilian race relations that I have ever read.\\" Reviewing the book for the American Journal of Sociology, Melissa Nobles noted, \\"Edward Telles's rich and important book is the latest, and most systematic, sociological study of Brazilian race relations. As its title implies, the book is also comparative, as the significance of race in Brazil is explicitly compared with its significance in the United States and in South Africa, to a lesser extent. American race relations have, and arguably continue, to serve as the paradigmatic case against which other countries are compared and from which sociological theories are derived.\\"  Books  *RACE IN ANOTHER AMERICA: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SKIN COLOR IN BRAZIL Princeton University Press, 2004 (Also available in Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese) *GENERATIONS OF EXCLUSION: MEXICAN- AMERICANS, ASSIMILATION, AND RACE, Russel Sage Foundation, 2008 (Also available in Spanish) * JUST NEIGHBORS?: RESEARCH ON AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO RELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, Russel Sage Foundation, 2011 * PIGMENTOCRACIES: ETHNICITY, RACE, AND COLOR IN LATIN AMERICA, The University of North Carolina Press, 2014 * DURABLE ETHNICITY-- MEXICAN AMERICANS AND THE ETHNIC CORE, Oxford University Press, 2019 * PIGMENTOCRACIAS.

HICAP was part of a major effort by the U.S. Army ‚Äì called the Composite Artillery Projectile Program ‚Äì to develop lightweight ammunition for 155-mm M199 gun tubes. The program sought to replace 155-mm steel shells with a two-piece design permitting the weight savings to be allocated to increased payload or longer range. The project was collaborative effort between the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Aberdeen, MD and the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) in Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. Five HICAP projectiles were successfully tested at the Yuma Proving Ground, AZ in June 1996.  Background  The Army‚Äôs early 155-mm artillery had steel bodies and weighed 100 lbs. 65% percent of the weight of the shell was in the steel body. This original design, while durable enough to withstand inertial loads during firing, was limited in the amount of munitions that could be carried within the shell. During the Composite Artillery Projectile Program, the Army sought to enhance the payload of 155mm shells while reducing the ammunition‚Äôs bulk. A mass-efficient projectile, also called High-Capacity Artillery Projectile, was developed through the use of composite materials, which offered both weight reduction and material strength to withstand severe firing conditions. While HICAP shell was a lighter ammunition than its predecessor, it lacked the outer shell mass for adequate stability during flight. A deployable fin assembly was designed from 1992-1994 at ARL, which included six-blade fins at the base of the shell, allowing the projectile to maintain forward center of gravity after firing.  Description  The HICAP was a two- piece projectile using a six-blade fin configuration. The fins were designed to be stowed in the barrel and deployed from the shell at muzzle exit. The round consisted of two parts, each carrying a full single load of cargo. A quick-connect joint was designed at the center of the round to allow transport of the two pieces. When assembled, HICAP was 72-in long with ¬Ω-in wall thickness and weighed 74 lbs.

That ruling led to a split among district courts that has yet to be definitively resolved.Faryniarz v. Ramirez, No. 3:13-CV-01064 (CSH), 2015 WL 6872439 (D. Conn. Nov. 9, 2015). Background Anthony Czarnik was a chemist and one of the founders of Illumina, serving as its Chief Scientific Officer from 1998 to 2000.Czarnik v. Illumina, Inc., No. D041034, 2004 WL 2757571 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2014). He had a falling out with his co-founders, which eventually led to his termination.Czarnik successfully sued Illumina for wrongful termination. Czarnik v. Illumina, Inc., No. D041034, 2004 WL 2757571 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2014). Chemical & Engineering News 2005, 83(7), 22. At the time of his departure, several patent applications had been filed by Illumina listing Czarnik as an inventor or co-inventor. Almost a year after Czarnik left Illumina, a patent attorney for the company sent Czarnik a letter informing him that Illumina had continued to file patent applications on which the company believed Czarnik was a co-inventor, based in part on invention disclosure forms listing Czarnik as such. Illumina sought for Czarnik to assign all rights to the patents to the company, as he had done while he was employed. While reviewing Illumina's patents and applications pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Czarnik discovered that Illumina had filed and prosecuted numerous patents that contained his inventions, without identifying him as an inventor. Czarnik sent letters to the USPTO, requesting a correction of inventorship on the patents and pending applications, but the USPTO did not respond. In June 2005 Czarnik sued Illumina, seeking corrections of inventorship under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 256, seeking declaratory judgments of patent unenforceability, and alleging a state law claim of fraud. Section 256 of the Patent Act states, \\"Whenever . . . through error an inventor is not named in an issued patent, the [USPTO] Director may . . . issue a certificate correcting such error.\\" If the patent owner will not voluntarily request the change, an omitted inventor may bring a claim in federal court. Czarnik alleged in his complaint that he \\"suffered damage to his reputation and standing within the scientific community\\" and did not receive the reputational benefits of being named as an inventor. He also alleged that he was unable to join a start-up company, resulting in a loss of approximately $1 million. District Court After Czarnik filed an amended complaint, Illumina filed a motion to dismiss. Illumina argued that Czarnik lacked standing to bring his claim under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 256; in the alternative, Defendant argued that 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 256 is inapplicable to pending patent applications. Illumina also argued that there was no case or controversy on which a declaratory judgment action could be based and that Czarnik had failed to state a claim for fraud under Delaware law. The district court first explained that a plaintiff must meet the standing requirements of Article III of the U.S. Constitution in order to bring a claim in federal court. Therefore, Czarnik had the burden of demonstrating (1) an injury in fact, (2) a causal connection between the injury and conduct complained of, and (3) that the injury was redressable. In omitted inventor cases, a plaintiff must show that he has suffered some sort of pecuniary consequence in order to have standing; mere reputational harm is generally insufficient to establish standing. Illumina argued that Czarnik merely suffered reputational harm and therefore lacked standing. The district court noted that the Federal Circuit, in Chou v. University of Chicago, had suggested in dicta that it \\"is not implausible\\" that reputational injury could satisfy the standing requirements of 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 256. In Chou the appellate court noted that \\"being considered an inventor of important subject matter is a mark of success in one's field‚Ä¶ Pecuniary consequences may well flow from being designated as inventor.\\" The district court held that dismissal of Czarnik's ¬ß256 claim for lack of standing was not appropriate, noting, \\"Plaintiff has alleged that he has suffered harm to his reputation and standing in the scientific community. As a result, Plaintiff alleges that he has been unable to secure a position at a start-up company and earn a salary comparable to his salary at Illumina.\\" As to Illumina's alternate argument, the district court noted that with respect to the pending applications, Czarnik had requested the Court to issue an order directing the USPTO to correct inventorship on the pending applications, relying on 35 U.S.C. 116. The court distinguished Section 116 from Section 256 and agreed with Illumina that the court had no statutory authority to order corrections to pending applications. The court also found there to be no case or controversy relating to the claims for a declaratory judgment and dismissed those claims but found that Czarnik had alleged elements of a state law fraud claim. Therefore, the court granted Illumina's motion in part and denied it in part.Mann, Philip P. \\"The Invisible Man\\" Intellectual Property Today 2007, 12 (Dec.), 39. Significance The holding in Czarnik v. Illumina Inc. was the first time a court held that reputational harm was sufficient to satisfy the standing requirement to bring a correction of inventorship claim. The Czarnik ruling has since been relied on by multiple courts for the proposition that reputational harm can confer standing on a plaintiff pursuing a claim under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 256.Shukh v. Seagate Tech. LLC, No. 10‚Äì404 (JRT/JJK), 2013 WL 1197403 (D. Minn. Mar. 25, 2013) For example, in Hoang v. Abbott Laboratories, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois stated that \\"one court determined that a plaintiff had standing to assert a claim under section 256 for alleged harm to his reputation\\", referencing Czarnik.Hoang v. Abbott Labs., No. 08-c-189, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49468 (N.D. Ill. June 12, 2009); see also, GE v. Wilkins 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22005 *4 fn. 2 (E.D. Ca. Jun. 13, 2011). Courts and legal scholars have characterized this idea as a \\"moral right to credit\\". However, other courts have rejected the theory, leading to a split among district courts that has yet to be definitively resolved;Faryniarz, 2015 WL 6872439 at *7; see also, Pedersen v. Geschwind, 141 F. Supp. 3d 405, 417 (D. Md. 2015). however, the Federal Circuit in Shukh v.

It was designed by the Colonial Architect‚Äôs Office under the direction of James Barnet, and built from 1885 to 1889 by James Reynolds. The property is owned by Australia Post, an agency of the Australian Government. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  = Background = The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first postmaster in the colony of New South Wales. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived; however, this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout New South Wales. In 1863, the postmaster general, W. H. Christie, noted that accommodation facilities for postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The first telegraph line was opened in Victoria in March 1854 and in New South Wales in 1858. The New South Wales colonial government constructed two lines from the GPO, one to the South Head Signal Station, the other to Liverpool. Development was slow in New South Wales compared to the other states, with the Government concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban ones. As the line spread, however, telegraph offices were built to accommodate the operators. Unlike the post office, the telegraph office needed specialised equipment and could not be easily accommodated in a local store or private residence. Post and telegraph offices operated separately until January 1870 when the departments were amalgamated, after which time new offices were built to include both postal and telegraph services. In 1881 the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney, three years after the first tests in Adelaide. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in country New South Wales from the late 1880s onwards. Again the post office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, further emphasising its place in the community as a provider of communications services. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in New South Wales. The post offices constructed during this period featured in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975, the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Post and Telecommunications Department. This was the creation of Telecom and Australia Post. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings towards smaller shop front style post offices. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = North Sydney Post Office = The first post office in North Sydney was opened on 1 May 1854, trading under the name of St Leonards, the official name for the area until 1890. Mr G. H. Stevens was appointed first postmaster in 1854 with an annual salary of ¬£12, retiring in 1870 due to deteriorating health. The St Leonards post office serviced a large area of the lower North Shore, and by 1874 it was recommended that a \\"Branch\\" post and telegraph office be established at North Shore, upgrading the current office to an official post office with telegraph facilities. In that year both the Superintendent of Telegraphs and the Postal Inspector were requested to investigate appropriate sites for a new post and telegraph office, as well as an estimated cost for the laying of telegraph cable across the harbour. This initial investigation for a post office site began a ten-year saga for the Postmaster General in North Sydney. The Postal Inspector first advised of suggestions from both the Mayor of East St Leonards, and the Mayor of St Leonards that the site of the Police Station would be the most suitable site for a Post and Telegraph Office. This proposal was firmly rejected by the Inspector General of Police and so the PMG decided to advertise for other premises. Advertisements were then placed in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Empire on 11 November 1874. Postal Inspector Moyse recommended that an official office be located close to the existing office in Mount Street, as this would make it central to the three municipalities of East St Leonards, St Leonards and Victoria. In response to the advertisements, many people in and around North Sydney made offers to sell or rent property to the Department. During the search for a permanent site (from June 1876) it was decided to rent the property of Mrs Jane Glover, for ¬£2 per week. Her premises was situated at the junction of Blue's Point and Lane Cove Roads, and Mount and Miller Streets opposite the police station, and consisted of a newly erected store and dwelling house of seven rooms. A joint report on North Sydney Post Office was submitted by four postal inspectors in June 1876, recommending that the Government should erect a suitable building for a post office. The Department agreed to put money on the Parliamentary estimates committee for a new office, but was advised by the Council Clerk that the only portion of land available within the Municipality dedicated for public use was the wharf at Blues Point. The Clerk further advised that the most suitable piece of land available was owned by Hon. F. Lord, being centrally located with a frontage to both Miller and Walker Streets of , and a frontage of to Blue Street. The Department advised that it did not consider the purchase of such a large site to be necessary. Between 1876 and November 1877, the Department was offered thirteen separate sites for purchase around North Sydney for the erection of a new Post Office ranging in both size and price. In November 1877, two senior officers recommended the purchase of a parcel of land owned by W. G. Matthews with frontage to Lane Cove Road be purchased. The land cost ¬£375, with plans being drawn and ¬£4,000 provided by the estimates committee for construction of the post office. However, before any work could begin, complaints were received by residents that the site was too isolated and so the project was put on hold. In April 1880 a conference was held between the four interested municipalities to discuss the location for the post office. It was decided that the site of the local Watch House was the most appropriate plus a portion of Government land adjoining it, which had been promised to the St Leonards Council as a site for the town hall. It was also recommended that the watch house be moved to the post office site. When it became known that a new site was being looked for, more offers of land came to the department. A further five land offers were put to the department between 1880 and 1884 before a final decision was made. Finally, in February 1884, the Postmaster General told Parliament that steps were being taken to appropriate the Government land upon which the School of the Arts stood. A few months later it was announced that the land that had been bought from Matthews had been given to the School of the Arts in exchange for the site that had been taken over. In February 1885 a tender was accepted from A. & F. Heinan for the erection of a combined Post Office, Court House and Police Station for ¬£12,670. However following a dispute with Heinan, another builder, James Reynolds took over the contract at a reduced cost of ¬£11,500. Twelve months after the start of work an inquiry into the condition of the Department of Public Works reported that, while the contract for the building was ¬£11,500, the likely cost of the completed development would be closer to ¬£17,000, which was an illustration of the \\"impropriety of erecting buildings on ill-adapted sites\\". The three buildings were completed between 1886, which is the date for the courthouse, and 1889 when construction of the post office was finished. The office was ready for occupation on 31 January 1889, with the cost of the post office section being ¬£4500. A clock was installed over the front entrance to the office, later being transferred into a new tower. The clock tower was built over the entrance in 1895 at a cost of ¬£965, with the clock being installed in July 1900. Circular stairs were also installed to the front of the office during this time. The delay in installing the clock had been caused by the postmaster general recommending that if the residents wished for a clock in the tower, then they should contribute a third of the cost. Little information is held in relation to work on the building between the early 1900s to the 1970s. During 1974‚Äì1975 the post office underwent a major renovation costing $233,870. During this process the entire interior was renovated with wood panelling and the counter extended to allow for more serving positions. A two-storey addition was to be built in place of the existing courtyard affording more working space on the ground and mezzanine levels. Within the new addition a parcel contractor's room, drive-in mail pick-up and delivery facilities and improved staff amenities were also added. The work was completed by November 1975. In 1977 the exterior stonework was restored and repainted at a total cost of $80,000.  Description  North Sydney Post Office is situated in a prominent position within the busy CBD of North Sydney. As part of a complex of buildings containing the Court House and Police Station, the building is a landmark feature within the surrounding streetscape. This complex is an important civic conservation group of late Victorian buildings which define the centre of North Sydney. The post office is a two-storey Victorian Free Classical rendered brick building, with a four- and-a-half-storey corner clock tower. It has a complex hipped, skillion slate and corrugated steel roof, and the clock tower has a domed zinc roof with small dormers and a finial at the apex over an open sided bell room. Four rendered and moulded chimneys can be seen to punctuate the roof line behind the moulded parapet that extends along both street facades. North Sydney Post Office is a rendered brick building painted cream and tan, with classically styled detailing and reddish brown trim. Detailing comprises moulded string courses, imitation blockwork, central pediment, arched windows, columns to the bell room and arched bays to the adjacent building. Additions to the building appear to have mainly occurred to the rear of the two-storey building towards William Street, comprising single-storey brick buildings currently used for storage of the higher rear dock area. This opens to the small rear yard accessed off William Street. There is a small balcony off the first-floor corner facade below a pediment with a rendered balustrade. It has an asphalt lined floor, masonite or fibre cement sheet soffit, and a flagpole projecting from the centre. Ground-floor verandahs are to the post box areas and have grey masonite or fibre cement sheet soffits, grey tiled floor, brown tiled lower walls, fixed windows over the post boxes and attached fluorescent lights. Adjacent to the balcony is a small room accessing the clock tower via a series of four steel ladders. The various levels of the tower have timber boarded floors, painted English Bond brick walls and copper clad bell room floor. The disused clock mechanism is now powered by an electric motor and remains intact within the tower. The clock features four large black on white faces to each side. Fenestration is uniform; window openings are symmetrical about the corner tower with regularly spaced openings beyond to each facade, especially considering the arched bays of the adjacent Court House. There are narrow single upper and lower pane sash windows to the entry foyer, two pane upper and lower sash windows to the retail area with arched top sashes and modern windows to later rear additions. The ground-floor of North Sydney Post Office consists of four main areas. These include the carpeted large front retail area, central mail room and offices and post box areas. Ceilings to this floor are plasterboard to the post boxes areas and retail area with a coved cornice. There is board and batten to the rear section of the retail area and plaster to the front entry with a wide moulded cornice. Extensive air conditioning ducting on the ground-floor and first-floor is suspended, with modern pendant and fluoro lights. Architraves and skirting partitions appear to have been installed at a later stage, while there are retained original openings and wall fabric. There is a cut render dado to the front entry foyer. The ground-floor has automatic front doors, glazed internal doors to the retail area and predominantly modern flush and security internal doors. There are plasterboard partitions to the retail area and post boxes area and paired columns to the front of the retail area. No fireplaces were evident to this floor. The main stair accessing the complex of levels that make up North Sydney Post Office comprises polished turned timber posts and balusters and sheet vinyl floor with black edge strips. The early skirting is polished and there are carved brackets to the upper flight. The first-floor comprises four main areas. They include the front corner carpeted offices, tiled and vinyl floored staff facilities at the centre, carpeted mailroom with dock and post boxes area at the rear. There is an operational conveyor belt servicing the ground-floor in the mailroom. Ceilings to the first-floor are varied. They include plasterboard to the hall and suspended ceiling to the centre- partitioned office, cleaner's room, mailroom and dock. There are plaster ceilings to the other offices with coved cornices and a ceiling rose in the eastern front office. Lighting is both suspended and attached fluorescent tubing. Architraves partitions are later, with some original architraves on original openings. Skirting is later, plain, brown and narrow. The first-floor windows are generally two pane double hung sash windows, with some single upper and lower pane windows and two internal windows to the partitions of the centre office. There are modern fixed windows to the mailroom high in the wall and a skylight to the store room of the mail room. Doors on the first-floor are a combination of predominantly modern flush doors and early French doors on the balcony and tower entry. Walls on the first-floor include partitions to the centre office, lunch room, locker rooms and cleaners room. The remaining walls are early rendered and painted brick with some timber veneer partitions at the stair landing to the mailroom. Walls on the bathrooms have a modern tiled fitout. Fireplaces on this floor are bricked in and the surrounds removed. North Sydney Post Office signage is limited to Post Office lettering on each facade at first-floor level and some standard Australia Post signs on the Mount Street facade. North Sydney Post Office is located within the North Sydney CBD which is largely comprises multi storey predominantly modern buildings. Landscaping is limited to uniformly positioned plane trees within the concreted perimeter pavement. = Condition = As at 12 July 2001, The condition of North Sydney Post Office is generally good. However, there is some evidence of moisture damage and cracking to some ceilings of the upper floor and to the cornice of the ground-floor front entry. North Sydney Post Office has undergone a series of changes to the interior with little remaining original fabric. The exterior appears largely intact, with sympathetic additions. North Sydney Post Office retains the features which make it culturally significant, such as the elegant clock tower, arcaded porches, and pedimented portico, along with its overall style, scale and form.  Heritage listing  As at 12 July 2001, North Sydney Post Office is significant at a State level for its historical associations, strong aesthetic qualities and social value. North Sydney Post Office is associated with the development of postal services in the North Sydney area from 1854. As such, the current Post Office is associated with the growth of the area during the mid-nineteenth century. North Sydney Post Office is historically significant because it is also associated with the development of communications services in the North Sydney (originally called St Leonards) area during the late nineteenth century, as the growing population required improved services. North Sydney Post Office is also historically significant because it is associated with the New South Wales Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, which designed and maintained a number of post offices across New South Wales between 1865 and 1890. North Sydney Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a distinctive example of the Victorian Free Classical style, with strong visual appeal. It is located on a prominent corner site and makes a significant contribution to the streetscape of the North Sydney civic precinct, and, along with the adjoining Court House and Police Station, provides an insight in the earlier built form of the North Sydney CDB. This complex of civic buildings forms an important civic conservation group in North Sydney. The North Sydney Post Office is also considered to be significant to the community of North Sydney's sense of place. The North Sydney Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The North Sydney Post Office is associated with the development of postal services in the North Sydney area from 1854. As such, the current Post Office is associated with the growth of the area during the mid-nineteenth century. The North Sydney Post Office is also associated with the development of communications services in the North Sydney area (then known as St Leonards) during the late nineteenth century, as the growing population required an improved standard of service and facilities. The historical background to the choice of location of the post office provides an insight into the bureaucracy of the late nineteenth-century New South Wales Government Departments and their relationship with the local community. North Sydney Post Office is associated with the New South Wales Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, which designed and maintained a number of post offices across New South Wales between 1865 and 1890. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. North Sydney Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a strong example of the Victorian Free Classical style, with strong visual appeal. The elegant clock tower features an enriched belfry in the Baroque manner, which forms a large part of the building's character. It is located on a prominent corner site, and makes a significant contribution to the streetscape of the North Sydney civic precinct. Along with the adjoining courthouse and police station, the post office provides an insight in the earlier built form of the North Sydney CDB. This complex of buildings forms an important civic conservation group in the area, and defines the centre of the North Sydney CBD. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As an important local landmark and the centre of communications for over a century, North Sydney Post Office is considered to be significant to the local community. North Sydney Post Office, as part of the Court House and Police Station complex, also defines a sense of place for residents of North Sydney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has some potential to contain archaeological information which may provide data relating to the previous use of the site by the School of Arts and the evolution of the building and out-buildings associated with the use by the post office. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The design of North Sydney Post Office is considered unusual as part of the grouping of the post office, courthouse and police station as a late Victorian period civic complex is rare. The importance of this group in defining the \\"centre\\" of North Sydney also has rarity value. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The North Sydney Post Office is a good example of the Victorian Free Classical style of architecture. It is part of the group of nineteenth- century post offices in New South Wales designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet.

Where physical evidence survives, renewed detailing should follow, as closely as practical, the original. New services should be discretely inserted. External works shall respect the character of the original landscaping, in particular the curving front entry and palm trees. Car parking shall be located at the side of the house, in a way which minimises the visual impact. The front fence and entry gates shall be retained or reused to suit new entry requirements. The most appropriate and compatible use for Kailoa would be one which retains the essential external formand intenral arrangement of spaces. Such uses could include residential, cultural or community uses, an art gallery or small scale commercial functions. The overall impact of such uses should minimise changes to the fabric and setting.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 13 December 2004, Kailoa forms an integral and important part of an area with a rich and varied collection of residential architecture, the adjacent streets being a rare survival of intact 19th century townscape in North Sydney. It is a good example of its type and has retained its garden setting, being a single storey free standing Victorian Italianate villa, () set well back from the street on a prominent hill to the rear in landscaped grounds with a fair number of mature trees and well maintained garden setting. It is of state historic and social significance for its associational values and representative aesthetic values of this type of place. It is of regional historic, social and associative aesthetic significance as a representative example of its period and type.

Their language is called Sepulana and is considered dialect of the Northern Sotho language group. The area where the Pulana live is called Mapulaneng, it stretches from Crocodile River in the south to Olifants River in the north, Lebombo Mountains in the east and also includes the whole town of Hazyview, Lepunama (Nelspruit), Sabie, Graskop, Hoedspruit, Barberton, Lydenburg and Dullstroom in the west. In the Pulana language or Sepulana, Mapulaneng means \\"Place of the Mapulana people\\"; the tribe derive their name from their founding leader, Lepulana who later changed his name to Chiloane. Mapulana are descendants of Morolong and their origin can be traced back to the Kgalagadi before they settled in Thaba Chueu, in what is today eastern Lesotho and Shakwaneng (Carolina) in the 1500s. Mapulana of Matshwe I got their name from their leader Pulane and they are offshoots of Amazizi and they are of Nguni origin. History The origin of the MaPulana and the history of how long they have been living in the greater Mapulaneng area is a topic of hot debate. Research shows that there are three groups of Mapulana, Mapulana of Mohlomi who are Bakwena and the first Mapulana to settle at Thaba Chueu, Mapulana of Matshwe I, of Pulane who are Amazizi and used to live along the Tugela River and later joined the other Mapulana at Thaba Chueu. The Mapulana of Chiloane who are Barolong by origin and left the main Barolong tribe during the reign of Tau. The Mapulana King Malele had two prominent sons, the eldest was Morale aka Chiloane jnr and Mashego. The two were better warriors and well respected by their followers. A bitter quarrel erupted between the two brothers over a young woman who happen to their cousin and the conflict was concealed by the royal family and told the people that the brothers fought over a grain barn(seshego sa mabele) After realising that the people were supporting the elder brother, Mashego left with his followers and settled along some Bakwena in what is present day Swaziland and detached himself from the main Mapulana tribe. Chiloane and Mashego were both recognized as Mapulana kings with Chiloane being the senior. The Mapulana of Chiloane used to live in Phageng (Empakeni) south east of Nelspruit and along the Lepunama River (Nelspruit) while Mapulana of Mashego lived at Motsheteng(Emjindini, Barberton where Masoyi II grandson of Mashego was buried) MaPulana historian Moses Mashego tells us \\"They had two kings, Mashego and Chilwane, the rest were subjects and chiefs.\\" In December 1864, the MaPulana defeated the Swazi\`s at the battle of Moholoholo under the leadership of four chiefs,Marangrang (Kgwedi) Maripe Mashile, Chiloane and Mohlala, with Sekakole Maatjie who was a brave warrior and a magician. The BaPedi under King Sekhukhune refused to help and the Mapulana defended their stronghold of Moholoholo mountains against a Swazi invasion sent by King Mswati II.The Swazi\`s were annihilated and the first to meet their death at the top of the mountain was the Swazi king\`s younger brother Zimase. Boulders were rolled down to ward off the enemy, and numerous attacks on their stronghold were repelled. Skeletons of the Swazi casualties littered the mountain for a long time afterwards. The river below the Mountain was named Motlasedi (Klaserie) There are legendary tales among the MaPulana about the bravery and cleverness of Sekakole (who was already and old man) at the Battle of Moholoholo. It is said that he wielded guns that he had traded for, and performed many magic spells to best the Swazi soldiers with one notable tale telling of how he turned himself into an anthill to confuse his enemy and escape. Culture and Traditions =Religion= Like most Sotho- Tswana groups, MaPulana believe in Badimo (ancestors). When they perform their ancestral worship (go phasa badimo) they face the direction of Shakwaneng, which is towards the east. There is no single god but all the ancestors or spirits are venerated. To appease the spirits you occasionally need to make sacrifices. During the sacrifices traditional beer is made and an animal (goat/chicken/cow) has to be a slaughtered. Some blood of the slaughtered animal together with some beer is poured on the legandelo (sacrificial platform) as offering to the spirits. The senior most member of the clan present at the sacrifice calls out the names of the ancestors according to hierarchy accompanied by the clapping of hands of the other members of the clan. The Mmalo (Coral) tree is usually planted on the sacrificial platform. =Medicine= Traditional medicine has been and still is a specialty of Mapulana. This could be attributed to the rich sub tropical climate of Mapulaneng making herbs to grow in abundance. Traditional medicine is dispensed by Dingaka (traditional doctors). To become a traditional doctor one has to undergo rigorous and lengthy training under a Gobela (Guru). A traditional doctor-in-training is called a letwasane (Sangoma).Rainmaking was also Mapulana's specialty =Initiation= Mapulana initiate their youth into womanhood and manhood. The initiation school (koma) is held in winter. The practices of initiation schools are marked by secrecy. Boys who have undergone initiation together will belong to the same mphato/moroto (regiment). An elaborate system is in place to distinguish a regiment from another based on when the regiment was initiated. The uninitiated cannot \\"visit\\" an initiation school when it is in session. The names of Mephato ya badika are Matuba, Mangana, Magakwa, Madingwane, Mankwe, Maakwa, .Madisha, Makgola, Madikwa, Manala, Magolopo. As can be expected women do not have regiments. =Clan system= Mapulana have a class system, known as Dikgoro (Clans lit. \\"kraals\\"). There are those who come from Kgorong e kgolo (higher clan) or Kgorong ea nyana (lower clan). Those from Kgorong e kgolo are of royal blood or are born from the senior wife and are expected to be dikata-pele (leaders) during initiation ceremonies. This system is also used in the go loma maraka (festival of first harvest) and during the planting season. The primary Clanships of the MaPulana are bagaMashego, bagaMalele, bagaMogane, bagaChilwane, bagaNonyane, . Both Mashego and Malele are chiefs in the Bushbuckridge area, Chilwane is the chief in the Acornhoek and Pilgrem's Rest area and Mogane and Nonyane in the Graskop and Sabie area.Legendary King of Bapedi ba Mapulana of is buried in Mmadiokane (Manaledi )Village Botswana after relocating from Mmalebogo with his clan of Ba ga Mogoma of his uncle Kgosi Disikalala. =Marriage= A boy's family used to identify a family from which a boy was supposed to marry. The boy then wooed the girl who meets his fancy in that chosen family. In some cases the boy identified his own girl. For all purposes, the marriage was arranged as the families gave their blessings behind the scenes. The boy's family negotiated on dikgomo tsa bogadi which had to be paid to the girl's family. Polygamy was practiced. The first wife and her offspring held a higher status. The inheritance passed through the first wife before being passed to the junior wife and her offspring. =Naming= When children are born ba ya relela (they get the name of their ancestor). When somebody's name is Thadishe, for instance, he may well be Thadishe the 6th. The paternal grandmothers and aunts know which name to grant a child. This was usually done after consulting with the Ngaka who will tell them who is being reincarnated by the child's birth. When a baby is sleepless or sickly, he/she is pointed to the moon by his grandmother or aunt. The grandmother will chant out: mogwera wa go ke yela, gola o reme diphate,o tshware lerumo or lwe dintwa! (There is your friend/ Your friend is the moon, grow and cut trees (for wood), grow, pick up the spears and fight wars!) In essence, grow and be strong. =Livestock= Leruo (livestock) and mashemo (land under cultivation) used to distinguish a rich man from a poor man. Land belonged to all the residents of an area and the Chief allocated the cultivation space. Grazing land was communal. The land tenure system of Mapulana was that land could not be bought or sold. Dipholwane (game) was hunted for food, medicinal or ceremonial purposes. =Calendar= The calendar of Mapulana works in lunar months, with the dawning of the full moon being the first day of the month. In SePulane the word kgwedi (moon) also means month. The shape and brightness of the moon can be read to determine when rains are going to fall. The year starts when the first rains start in September or when plants start to bloom. Therefore, September is the New Year. The New Year heralds the start of planting season for crops that yield the staple foods of Mapulana. Planting used to be done according to the family's seniority, dikgoro tse kgolo starting first and others junior clans follow. Mabele (maize and millet) get planted first, dintlu (jugobeans) last. Other crops like Mjumbula(cassava), mathape(colocasia), matlapala etc. being planted at any time of the year. When plants are ready for harvesting, the elder of a clan will pick a small selection of the harvest. He or she will call out the names of the ancestors and dedicate the harvest to them. Every member of that clan will be made to nibble from the small pickings. This will be the festival of the first harvest. It is strongly forbidden to eat any picking unless these processes called go loma(to nibble) was done. Etymology and symbolism The name MaPulana refers to a common ancestor named Lepulana, his name referring to legendary accounts of his rainmaking abilities. Lepulana was also known as Chiloane. The totem symbol of the MaPulana is the lion. The tribal praise poem goes as follows: Northern Sotho (MaPulana Dialect) \\"Re batau a phaga a Malala a moenyane. Batho ba ba boyang Phageng, ba ba boyang Shakwaneng. Shakwana la kgomo le motho go phalang? Go phala motho gobane kgomo re lla re djia.\\" English translation \\"We are the people of the lion, of the wild cat of Malala of moenyane. We are people from Phageng, we are people from Shakwaneng. Which is more important, the reeds of a cow and a human? A human is better since with a cow we cry while we eat the meat.\\" Territory Most MaPulana live in the area from Hoedspruit to Hazyview and their surrounds. This greater area is often referred to as \\"Mapulaneng\\" which means \\"Place of the people of Pulana (Lepulana)\\". Their ancestral lands historically, however stretched from Klaserie (north of Hoedspruit in the north to as far south as Mbombela (Nelspruit) including present day Graskop, Sabie and Ohrigstad. There are also a significant number of MaPulana living in Mabopane, Winterveld and Klipgat north west of Pretoria as well as in Daveyton east of Johannesburg where there is a street named after the MaPulana. Other Villages of Mapulana include Chochocho Notable people of MaPulana descent *David Nyathi ‚Äì Soccer player. * Penny Lebyane - Media personality References   Ethnic groups in South Africa ","title":"MaPulana"},{"id":"58399541","text":"Aspergillus homomorphus is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus.

Varallo was born Mary Frascone in South Philadelphia in 1897, the daughter of Italian immigrants Agostino and Caterina Frascone. She graduated from West Philadelphia High School and later took classes at Peirce School of Business, the Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and Journalism, Temple University, the Pennsylvania School of Criminology, and the Leefson-Hille Conservatory. After marrying in 1921 to Alfred Varallo, she worked as a church organist. She and Alfred were married until her death in 1979, but never had any children. In addition to local Italian-American organizations, Varallo became involved in local Democratic Party politics in Philadelphia in the 1940s. She became the Democratic leader of the 36th ward in 1942 and was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1944, representing the multi- member 5th district along with Frank Lopez and former representative Anna M. Brancato. She sponsored a Woman's Equal Rights Bill that became law in 1945. The following election, in 1946, saw Republicans take back the three seats, but Varallo returned to the legislature in 1949 along with fellow Democrats Thomas Peta and Louis Amarando. Varallo won re-election for the next five terms. She served as chair of the House Welfare committee and, in 1959, became Minority Whip, the first woman to hold the position. Later that year, the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee endorsed Varallo for an open at-large seat on the Philadelphia City Council and she won nomination easily in the May primary. In the general election that November, Varallo placed fourth among the five Democrats elected to the at-large seats. In an editorial, the Philadelphia Inquirer praised Varallo's election, calling her \\"capable,\\" and noting that \\"unlike most of her fellow Philadelphia Democrats in the House, she is a worker.\\" Council President James H.J. Tate assigned her to lead the Public Health Committee. Later that year, she was a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention and was a presidential elector for John F. Kennedy. In 1963, Varallo was reelected, as were all of the other at-large members of City Council. The election in 1967 saw a divide in the Philadelphia Democratic Party as Mayor Tate ran for nomination to a second term against the organization choice, Alexander Hemphill. The tumult from Tate's victory spilled over into council races, as Varallo lost the primary for a third term, as did fellow Democratic at-large incumbent Leon Kolankiewicz. In 1968, Varallo ran for Congress but lost a four-way primary to the incumbent Democrat, James A. Byrne. That same year she was considered among possible nominees to the post of Treasurer of the United States, but was not selected. With that, she retired from politics. Varallo died at Shore Memorial Hospital in Somers Point, New Jersey on November 27, 1979, at the age of 82, and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.

She is best known for the Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge, which was co-authored with Frances Harriet Whipple Green McDougall. McDougall's publication, Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge (16mo., Providence, 1838), was a work of charity. Another edition was published in 1840, and still another in 1842. This volume of a 128 pages was published for the purpose of enabling the subject of it to repurchase some property of which she had been perhaps legally, but at all events unfairly, deprived. Early years Elleanor Eldridge was born in Warwick, Rhode Island, March 1784. Her maternal grandmother, Mary Fuller, was a Native American, belonging to the small tribe or clan, called the Fuller family; which was probably a portion of the Narragansett people. Certain it is, that this tribe or family once held great possessions in large tracts of land; with a portion of which Mary Fuller purchased her husband Thomas Prophet; who, until his marriage, had been a slave. Her grandfather had been kidnapped at the mouth of the Congo River, on board a ship upon which he had been enticed for the purposes of trade. He was brought to Rhode Island, where he was sold as a slave. Mary Fuller, having witnessed the departing glories of her tribes, died in extreme old age, at the house of her son, Caleb Prophet; being 102 years old. She was buried at the Thomas Greene burying place in Warwick, in the year 1780. Her daughter Hannah married Robin Eldridge, the father of Elleanor. Career Frontispiece and title page of the original memoirs. By dint of hard work and prudence, she was enabled to purchase a lot of land on Spring Street, in Providence, upon which she built a house, which she at several times enlarged until it became, to her, a valuable property, and was nearly paid for. It had cost about ; on it there was a loan of . On this loan, she paid an annual interest of ten per cent. Having an opportunity to purchase another estate adjoining her own, which materially improved her means of access to her house, she bought it for , upon which she paid cash and gave a mortgage of on her entire estate. Being taken sick, she rented her property and went away to recover her strength. While gone, the gentleman from whom she borrowed the died, leaving his estate to his brother. This brother attached Elleanor's property, sold it by the sheriff, and he himself bought it for exactly the amount of the mortgage.

She was not a woman who would submit quietly to such proceedings, and immediately set herself to work to obtain justice. General Ray Greene, Attorney General, assisted her, as did many of the best citizens of Providence, to whom she was well known.

He was also a writer and, for nearly twenty years after 1933, artistic director of the anti-Nazi Cabaret Cornichon.  Life  Bernhard Walter Lesch was born into a protestant family in Z√ºrich. Bernhard Robert Lesch, his father, was a painter. He attended a commercially oriented secondary school and then moved on to the University of Zurich where he studied Germanistics, history and philosophy. His time as a student also took him to Bern, Geneva and Berlin, but in 1922 it was back at the University of Zurich where he received his doctorate. His dissertation concerned \\"the problem of Tragedy [in the work of] Gerhart Hauptmann\\" (\\"Das Problem der Tragik bei Gerhart Hauptmann\\"). There followed several \\"Journeyman years\\" which took him to Paris, Berlin, Rome and Paris, working variously as a salesman, a journalist and a private tutor. He worked between 1926 and 1928 as a dramaturge and producer at the \\"Theater in der Klosterstra√üe\\" on the edge of Berlin and then settled for a further year in Vienna where he supported himself through writing. Returning to Switzerland, he premiered several of his own light dramas and comedies, such as \\"Du kannst mich nicht verlassen\\" (\\"You can't leave me\\"), at the Zurich Playhouse (\\"Schauspielhaus\\"), where he also staged \\"Bei Kerzenlicht\\" (\\"By candlelight\\") by Siegfried Geyer and \\"Reiner Tisch\\" (\\"Spring Cleaning\\") by Frederick Lonsdale. He then moved back to Berlin where he worked as a screenwriter. He returned again to Switzerland - this time permanently - in 1932. The focus of his film work between 1932 and 1935 was on advertising films and as a movie producer with Praesens-Film AG in Z√ºrich. In 1933 he teamed up with Richard Schweizer: together they co-wrote and co-produced \\"Wie d‚ÄôWahrheit w√ºrkt\\" (loosely \\"How the truth operates\\"), the first sound film produced in Switzerland to be scripted not in German but in a version of Swiss German. Another joint production for Praesens-Film, this time created in collaboration with Leopold Lindtberg, was the so-called \\"dialect comedy\\", Ja sooo! (1935). In 1933 Lesch was a co-founder with Otto Weissert of the Cabaret Cornichon. He became director of the new cabaret, which was inspired by and to some extent modelled on the Pfefferm√ºhle (\\"Pepper mill\\") cabaret opened a few months earlier, in Munich. At a time when politics were becoming increasingly polarised, and many of the political trends seemed to be pointing in a wrong direction, Lesch was clear that he could not opt out of public debate: \\"The humorist who does not remain a moralist will be left trading only in sensation and farce\\" (Der Humorist, der nicht ein Moralist bleibt, wird zum Possenreisser und Gesch√§ftemacher\\"). As the Cornichon's artistic director he did not hesitate to include material critical of the fascist states by which Switzerland was surrounded on almost three sides, to the north, east and south. But programmes also incorporated a social-critical tone directed at political targets even closer to home. During the Cornichon years Lesch wrote more than 400 \\"Chanson-style\\" songs for the cabaret. Some of the verses were published in two volumes which appeared in 1937 (\\"Cornichons. Verse aus dem Cabaret Cornichon\\") and 1945 (\\"Das Cornichon-Buch\\"). Even now, the Cabaret Cornichon did not absorb all his energy. On 14 November 1935 his stage play, \\"C√§sar in R√ºblikon\\", had its premier at the Zurich Playhouse (\\"Schauspielhaus\\") in a production directed by Leopold Lindtberg. Like his film \\"Ja sooo!\\", the stage piece was a \\"dialect comedy\\", which connected its diverse elements with a consistent antifascist theme: the inhabitants of R√ºblikon get rid of their Minister-president who has become a despot after the German model. In 1938 Lesch was placed in charge of theatrical presentations for the 1939 Swiss Federal Exhibition (\\"Landesaustellung\\"). He tried - with little success - to promote politically critical pieces such as Werner Johannes Guggenheim's anti-Nazi \\"Erziehung zum Menschen\\" (loosely \\"Educating people\\"). Nor was his own submission, entitled \\"Die kleine grosse Schweiz\\" (loosely \\"Little big Switzerland\\"), accepted for performance. By the later 1940s many of the old political targets of the Cabaret Cornichon were gone. The continent - Switzerland included - was exhausted and appetite for political satire diminished. Those who had invested in the cabaret had moved on, and Lesch was left to shoulder the entire burden of its growing indebtedness. In 1951 the Cabaret Cornichon closed down. During the 1950s Walter Lesch worked as an advertising copywriter, while continuing to write for the theatre. Probably his most notable theatrical contribution from this period was the text (in Swiss German) for Paul Burkhard's die Kleine Niederdorfoper which had its premier on 31 December 1951 at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich..  Personal  Around 1930 Walter Lesch teamed up with and married the Austrian born actress Mathilde Danegger. A staunch antifascist, after 1933 she was for practical purposes confined, as a German-language stage performer, to Switzerland. She took part in political cabaret, between 1934 and 1938, appearing regularly with the Cornichon. The couple's daughter, the actress Karin Lesch, was born in 1935. The marriage broke down progressively during the early 1940s, and Mathilde, who had met Herbert Cr√ºger in 1939 and at some stage had married him as her third husband, moved to Germany in 1947, taking Karin with her, after which Lesch was cut-off from his daughter.

Office of Policy Research, California Department of Insurance. 1994.  Most Expensive Election in Modern U.S. History, Other Than Presidential  With $207 million spent, the most expensive election campaign in U.S. modern history was the 1988 California insurance initiatives election battle. Only Prop. 103 won voter approval. The $207 million spent, in 2020 dollars adjusted for inflation, which was $95 million in 1988, was reported by the Los Angeles Times.See \\"$23 a Vote, Insurers Spent $55.87 on Prop. 104,\\" by Leo C. Wolinsky, Los Angeles Times, Mar. 31, 1989, p. 3 and p. 23. Prop. 103, the people's choice, won against the combined $200 million spent against it or trying to pass competing initiatives. Prop. 103 raised $6.4 million in small donations of about $30 from a statewide door-to-door canvass. These small donations from the canvass paid for the modest offices and canvasser salaries, which going into the election reached one million households. TV ads for Prop. 103 were run at no cost by TV stations only due to the fairness doctrine in place at the time, with some equal-time ads. These ads were in response to the tens of millions of dollars being spent by the insurance industry, which also used large direct-mail campaigns, coordinated by consultant Clint Reilly, who acknowledged the efforts against Prop. 103 by insurance companies lacked a lot of public support. With $200 million spent among the other initiatives, both pro and con, however, it came down to the wire, with Prop. 103 winning by only 1%, with a 51% yes vote. The campaign, and its results, received extensive national attention. Court challenges were turned down, and the California Supreme Court upheld every provision of 103. \\"Three other insurance measures-- Proposition 104, the industry's no-fault proposal, Proposition 100, backed by the state's trial lawyers, and Proposition 101, ... sponsored by dissident insurer Harry Miller,--all were overwhelmingly defeated,\\" reported Kenneth Reich, the L.A. Times staff writer who covered the insurance industry and this election. Reich wrote \\"But Proposition 103 campaign chairman Harvey Rosenfield suggested that if the insurance industry was in trouble with the public, it had only itself to blame.\\" Proposition 103 was written by Campaign Chairman Harvey Rosenfield, and endorsed by nationally-trusted consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who campaigned repeatedly with Rosenfield for Prop. 103. Staff on the campaign included Bill Zimmerman, noted by PBS for his earlier leading role in opposing the Vietnam War, Carmen Gonzales as Press Spokesperson, Angelo Paparella who directed the massive statewide canvass, Eric Hacopian who continued as a successful California political consultant, and Troy Deckert, who came from the national staff of a presidential campaign, and from years of political experience in Chicago. Deckert added a statewide voter palmcard, which was distributed by the canvassers, and statewide street-level postering, both standard Chicago methods. Patrick Overton (Now Patrick Kadzik), who also worked on a presidential campaign, was the first organizer who proved that the door-to-door canvass could raise small donations in sufficient amounts (about $150 per evening per canvasser) in order to support field modest offices and canvassers. When an election is won by 1%, every effort can accurately have been said to have been critical to victory, from Harvey Rosenfield's legal provisions, to Ralph Nader's endorsement, to the enormous, well-organized door-to-door effort.

Described posthumously by the Raleigh News and Observer as \\"one of its most gifted daughters\\", Clarke set out to demonstrate the literary talent of her state while also learning from other cultures and styles of writing. Born and raised in Raleigh, Clarke began her work by compiling an anthology of North Carolina poetry, Wood Notes, before writing her own poetry which appeared in numerous magazines, newspapers, and journals in the United States and abroad.  Early Life and Family  Clarke was born on May 13, 1827 in Raleigh, North Carolina to Thomas Pollock Devereux and Catherine Anne Johnson Devereux. Clarke came from a prominent, wealthy family. Her paternal great-grandfather was Jonathon Edwards, theologian and president of Princeton University. Her grandfather, Thomas Polk served as governor and acquired large sums of land on which he built plantations. On her mother's side, she was descended from Samuel Johnson, another early American clergyman and educator who was the first president of King's College (today Columbia University). Clarke's mother died when she was nine years old, leaving her to be raised by her father. Being a Yale graduate and lawyer, her father ensured each of his children received an education. Clarke was paired with a governess who followed the course of study offered at Princeton and Yale. She was particularly interested in learning other languages, notably German, French, Spanish, and Italian, and practiced translating their literature into English. Clarke traveled extensively in her early years. Before turning 20, she had lived in the West Indies and Texas. When visiting her uncle, Bishop Leonidas Polk, in Louisiana, Clarke became reacquainted with a childhood friend, Major William John Clarke. He was veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and made his living on a sugar plantation in Louisiana. The two were married on April 6, 1848 by her uncle. The couple lived in Louisiana for a few more years before returning to North Carolina and setting in Raleigh.  Writing Career  Mary Bayard Devereux Clarke was a writer from a young age. In fact, her sister saved some of her letters from the 1830s because she was appreciative of her writing. Her family valued her education and encouraged her to continue writing as she grew up. Clarke first gained prominence for her work as an editor. She wrote book reviews for publishers and compiled tomes of other writers' poetry. Clarke's career was varied, as she contributed to a number of magazines, books, collections of poetry, and other pieces of literature. She was an editor of Southern Field and Fireside in 1865, a writer for Peterson's Magazine, and a contributor for The Old Guard and Demorest's Monthly. Another of her notable works was her translation of French poet Victor Hugo‚Äôs works into English. Using pseudonyms, Clarke began her own career as a poet. One of her first works Woods-Note, also known as Carolina Carols: A Collection of North Carolina Poetry, was published in 1854 and gained significant recognition. This was a compilation of the works of many people, however most of the poems were her own. Her newfound recognition resulted in her being published in both newspapers and magazines. Clarke refused to allow her career to be confined by the typical restraints women experienced in this time period, and her husband was very supportive in this process.  Later Life  Between 1849 and 1858, Clarke had four children while developing her career. By 1853, she had established herself as a prominent writer in North Carolina, and composed her famous Wood Notes in the following years. She continued her writing career while traveling to Texas, Florida, Cuba, and the West Indies. The American Civil War had harsh effects on the Clarke family. William Clarke joined the Confederate Army and was captured and held prisoner in Fort Delaware. He never completely recovered from the injuries and illnesses he sustained during the war, and brought back heavy burdens to the Clarke household. He later developed a drinking problem that remained with him for the rest of his life. He managed to set up his law firm in New Bern and eventually became a judge, but was consistently unable to earn a sizable income due to his drinking. Clarke would continue to support her husband's dwindling income through her writing career for the rest of their lives. Her health began to deteriorate in the 1880s. Clarke suffered a stroke in 1883, which resulted in permanent paralysis of part of her body. Her husband died in January 1886. Clarke began to rapidly fade after his death, and suffered a second stroke on March 3. On March 30, 1886, she quietly ceased to breathe and was buried in New Bern.  Legacy  Mary Bayard Clarke did not conform to the typical expectations of a southern wife and mother in her era. She wrote poetry and appeared in news articles while raising her kids- an feat practically unheard of among her peers. She persevered through the discrimination of the times and showed that women were capable of more than motherhood. Clarke gained recognition for many of her smaller texts, but her most well-known work is Wood Notes, also known as Carolina Carols: A Collection of North Carolina Poetry. Although the collection was mostly of her own writing, some of the poems were other members of North Carolina society, and this work came to represent the society as a whole, for it included the voices of men, women, chief justices, congressmen, lawyers, and teachers. Furthermore, she gained recognition for her satirical political stories during the time of radical reconstruction. Ultimately, Clark was a trailblazer for professional women in the field of publishing, writing, and editing, particularly in the southern United States.

The strike started at the Farah plant in San Antonio in 1972 when the Hispanic women, called Chicanas, led by Sylvia M. Trevino, at the company demanded a labour union formation to fight for better working conditions. The two-year long strike included 4000 individuals, of which the majority were women.Farah Strike Ends After 21 Months The New York Times Retrieved 25 February 1974 William Farah was the CEO of the company. The company's workforce consisted of mostly Mexican women. In 1967, the company went public and employed around 7,000 people. In 1972, it had expanded globally employing 9500 people, making it the second largest employer in Texas. The company expected high production rates from its employees despite low wages and poor working conditions. This led to the beginning of the strike. Workers supporting the strike were penalized and risked their jobs. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) was the mediator of the strike and within a month after the strike begun, they launched a national boycott of the products of Farah Manufacturing Company.Farah: Unfinished Story NACLA Retrieved 25 September 2007 The strike was culminated in 1974 in the favor of the women workers.Farah Strike Has Become War of Attrition The New York Times Retrieved 16 June 1973Women Workers Defy Their Boss and Win a Union American Postal Workers Union Retrieved March 2016 The women employees benefitted from the strike as some women were then actively involved in political organizations fighting for women's rights and fair and safe labor environments.  Farah Manufacturing Company  The Farah Manufacturing Company, owned by Willie Farah, was the \\"largest manufacturer of men's and boy's pants in the United States.\\" The company had a total of eleven plants all based in San Antonio, El Paso, Victoria, and New Mexico with a total of 10,400 employees pre-strike. Five of the plants were located in El Paso, making it the largest employer in the city. The El Paso-based plants were also the largest private employer and was almost entirely unorganized. The El Paso plant, central part of the strike, was seven-tenths of a mile long with a capacity to hold up to 5,000 employees.  Reasons for the Farah strike  Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) is the union that represented the Farah strikers. A majority of the strikers were Chicanas, or Mexican American women. Although ACWA has been known to portray images of men as the face-of-the-movement, \\"majority of the workers at Farah and on striker were women... many of them were single female parents with children.\\" Many of the mothers on strike had to bring their children to the picket lines. At first, ACWA kept the women strikers \\"limited to picketing and clerking tasks, while men made public statements.\\" The Chicanas challenged ACWA's lack of gender neutrality and formed their own group to display their solidarity and talents, Unidad Para Siempre (Unity Forever), where they were able to utilize their techniques when they \\"organized speaking and television engagements, facilitated resources to supporters, and developed a strike fund directed from a local church.\\" This was a way for Chicanas to create a voice and claim space for women during the strike. =Job security= One of the reasons for the Chicana-led strike was lack of job security and Farah Manufacturing Co.'s lack of union support. Other factors that contributed to the strike were: no benefits for workers, gender prejudices, low wages, raises based on favoritism, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Alice Saenz, a Farah picketer, voiced her experience with Farah's effortless employment termination when she stated, \\"the main reason we need a union is for job security.\\" Another striker that was fighting against lack of job security was Armando, and he joined the picket line because he had eight children and was uncomfortable with not knowing if he would be fired for minor reasons. He stated, \\"For me it was job security, I saw a lot of people fired for no reason. Every day you have to think maybe this day I'll be fired because something else happens.\\" =Lack of benefits= Lack of benefits was another element for the strike. Although Farah Manufacturing Co. provided their workers with a clinic inside the plant and retirement plan, several of the striker's experiences with Farah's benefits were unacceptable and discriminatory. According to a pamphlet by The San Francisco Bay Area Farah Strike Support Committee, which provided a platform for the narrative of the strikers, \\"the clinic at Farah is supplied with birth control pills for the women employees, who are indirectly asked to take them. Farah's attitude is why should they be delivering babies when they can be delivering pants at this factory.\\" If an employee is ill, the company did not allow the employees to go home, instead, they were instructed to \\"take a number and go back to work and listen for your number to be called to see the company doctor...you don't get paid for the time you are in the clinic. He [the company doctor] gives you some pills and you are back to work again, so the company doesn't lose any production.\\" Many illnesses went misdiagnosed by the company doctor. As far as the retirement plan provided by Farah, several of the employees witnessed workers being terminated or forced to quit as they reached retirement age. In its 53 years of operation, pre-strike, no Farah workers were granted retirement. According to a striker, \\"With one older woman, Farah's speed-up wasn't driving her out fast enough so he had a supervisor standing over her every day until she couldn't take it anymore. She was forced to sign a form saying she quit on her own,\\" even though the uncomfortable working conditions forced her out. Another factor was the lack of maternity benefits. If the pregnant employee were to take time off after giving birth, she was not guaranteed her job upon arrival, she lost all seniority, and her pay would start back at new-hire wages. Due to these factors, \\"many of the women have to wait until the last week or two to take leave... several women have even had their babies at the plant!\\" These conditions were unacceptable and discriminatory for the female workers, and that was motivation for them to join the strike. =Discriminatory treatment= Gender prejudices were prevalent in the Farah Manufacturing Co. plants, and women were particularly discriminated against. Many of the women at Farah were either exclusive supporters of their household, or their family depended on their income to make ends meet. The North American Congress on Latin America stated, \\"women with several years on the job were still being paid minimum wage... women who were willing to date their Anglo supervisors were given preferential treatment, while others were subjected to constant harassment. 'The supervisors would snap their fingers at you, bang the machine and push you'.\\" Due to the gender-biased environment in the workplace, Chicanas decided to join the strike and fight for better working conditions. Wages for Farah employees were below the 1970s national average income, \\"most Farah employees (sewing-machine operators, etc.) are paid just above the federal minimum wage limit of $1.60 an hour compared to the $2.50 national average.\\" The average take-home pay for the Farah employees was $69 per week ($3,588 per year) which forced whole families to work at the Farah plant in order to survive. The wages given to Farah employees were substantially below the 1970s national poverty line. According to the National Census, the poverty line, around the time of the strike, for an average family of four was $3,968 per year, and Farah employees were, on average, bringing home $3,588 per year. =Health and safety= Safety and health hazards around the plant was another element in striking for better working conditions. \\"Health problems in the plant were numerous. Some workers contracted bronchitis from working directly under huge air conditioners, while others suffered from lack of ventilation.\\" The pressure of production played a factor in the amount of illnesses on the plant floor, \\"many women became ill, because they were reluctant to take time to go to the restroom or to get a drink of water.\\" =Unrealistic standards= Unattainable, difficult-to-meet quotas were the norm at Farah. One Chicana striker, Miss Munoz, shared her experiences pertaining to the quota system, \\"She had to ask for a raise having been at the same pay level for three years. She was told that unless she could raise her daily production quota and keep it there, she couldn't have a raise. She started working at Farah as a belt setter at $1.30 an hour with a quota of 18 bundles a day- a dozen pairs of pants to a bundle. When she went on strike she was being asked to do 125 bundles a day, 125 dozen pairs of pants.\\" Farah's supervisors would set unattainable quotas for his employees, and if they were not met, he would threaten their employment or reject pay raises.  The strike  The Farah strike was a major garment dispute that was originated and led by majority Chicanas. The strike lasted twenty-two months and took place between 1972 and 1974, predominately in El Paso, Texas. In May 1972, four thousand garment workers walked out of the Farah Manufacturing Company facility, with over 85% of the strikers being Chicanas and Mexicanas. They walked out of the Farah plant as a result of their demands to be represented by Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Worker's Union (ACWA) and have some measure of control over their daily working conditions. As strikers were outside the plant picketing, Farah supervisors were present at the rally to take pictures and names of the workers they were able to identify, and the following day the workers were fired due to their participation in the strike. Willie Farah, \\"paid low wages, pressured his employees to work faster and faster, consistently ignored health and safety conditions, and swiftly fired all those who complained.\\" This placed an immense amount of pressure on the factory workers, because they had a daily fear of being fired without cause or mediation. To the union organization, ACWA, if they were to represent the employees and force the mogul of factory owners, Willie Farah, into union contracts, they would be able to tackle several more factories around the nation. The president of ACWA, Anthony Sanchez, assured reporters that, \\"if they can crack Farah, they can organize anywhere in the country. He's the big one. The tough one. And that's what they're after.\\" So, Sanchez and ACWA were willing to use their union's resources to help the Farah protesters succeed in this battle. According to an article published in Corpus Christi Caller-Times newspaper, the reporter explained how Chicana strikers not only had support from ACWA, but they were staining national backing, including Senator Edward Kennedy, The United Farm Workers' Union, New York's Governor John O. Rockefeller, Los Angeles Mayor, Tom Bradley, and several other national figures. The National Organization for Women (N.O.W), an organization that has been widely criticized for its lack of inclusion of intersectional feminism, also supported the Farah strikers. El Chicano newspaper interviewed N.O.W's coordinator, Ms. Arlie Scott, and asked her why her organization supported this powerful movement, and her response was, \\"because it represents that positive action and personal courage required in the struggle to improve economic status of women and minorities.\\" Scott also stated that the Farah Strike is a \\"fight for all women,\\" to bring women out of the shadows, out of poverty, and out of oppression. Once the strike took off, ACWA created The Farah Distress Fund, which allowed the community to contribute directly to the 4,000 strikers and their families. The strikers began obtaining support from other unions, La Raza groups, students, clergy, and people from around the nation. A national boycott of Farah pants launched which was critical for their cause, because it would eventually force pressure on Willie Farah to adopt ACWA's union and better the working conditions of all his employees. = Willie Farah's reaction to the strike = Willie Farah was shocked at the strikes being held at multiple Farah factories, mainly El Paso- his hometown. He used several tactics to stop the strike, such as, outdated Texas laws, denial of loans to strikers, and Fortress Farah. A couple of weeks after the Farah Strike broke out, Willie Farah obtained a court injunction that stated, \\"people picketing had to be 50 feet apart.\\" This injunction was based on the 1880 Texas law. Picketers were being arrested for protesting Farah's company and being fined $4, which was a substantial amount of money to be forced to pay while not receiving wages. 800-1,000 strikers, mostly women, were arrested, some during midnight raids of their homes. The 1880 Texas law did not hold-up in court, and was later ruled as unconstitutional due to the United States's first amendment's protection of peaceful assembly. Willie Farah was on the board of directors at the First National Bank of El Paso and utilized his power to \\"cut off all loans to strikers,\\" which was another strategy to stop protesters. Fortress Farah was the name given to another Farah-scheme to end the strike, \\"The plants were surrounded with barbed wire and telescopic cameras. Plant guards were issued guns and unmuzzled attack dogs.\\" = Reaction of the local El Paso community = The reaction from local El Paso residents was favored towards Willie Farah. El Paso newspapers provided Farah with a positive platform, and completely silenced and villainized the striker's voices. El Chicano focused on Willie Farah's reaction, who referred to the women as \\"filth\\" and \\"unreasonable.\\" In that same article, the coordinator of N.O.W responded by saying, \\"when 'unreasonable' is the word used by one class, they use it when they want to subjugate another.\\" In Vicki Ruiz's book, From Out of the Shadows: Mexican American Women in Twentieth-Century America, she wrote that one of the Farah strikers stated, \\"We thought when we went out on strike that our only enemy was Farah... but we fount out it was also the press, the police, the businessmen...\\" Not only were the strikers facing repercussions from The Farah Manufacturing Co., Willie Farah, and Farah supervisors, but they were also facing backlash from the members of their local community of El Paso. It wasn't until the Farah Strike began obtaining national backing, support, and recognition that the El Paso natives began siding with the strikers.  Aftermath  The strike ended in January 1974 in-favor of the strikers. Mr. Farah adopted a union contract including: job security, arbitrable quotas, a grievance system, a company-paid health plan, recognition of the ACWA union, and rehire of the strikers. With the negative press surrounding Farah Manufacturing Company, and the period of economic stagnation in the United States, Farah's company began to declining. As a result of the national boycott of Farah pants, their sales declined from $150 million in 1972 to $126 million in 1974; retailers began taking Farah slacks off their racks to help support the cause and show their disapproval of Farah's business methods. Texas State Historical Association stated, \\"a national recession and company mistakes in production and marketing left Farah in a serious financial predicament. Layoffs, plant closures, and high turnover of the work force followed, thus inhibiting the growth of a strong union.\\" Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \\"strike of the century.\\" The reporter wrote, \\"By the time the work stoppage ended, March 1974, both sides suffered; The union had spent $8 million, and the company's image was irreparably damaged.\\" Farah Manufacturing Co.'s stock market value in 1972 was $39.50, and by 1974 it plunged to $8.00. This was primarily due to the negative media-attention caused by the Farah Strike. Today, Farah Manufacturing Co. has taken-on several different names, including Cliff Mark, Beau Mark, Golden Scroll, Passport, Club 20, Par Excellent, Su Par Jeans, Daire, Kinrod, Classic Twenties, and K-Mart.

The bridge collapsed at around 4:45 PM (IST), resulting in the death of 3 people while injuring at least 25 others. Majerhat Bridge Majerhat Bridge is located at Majerhat, Alipore, a neighbourhood of South Kolkata. It was a major arterial road (Diamond Harbour Road) in the area connecting the southern suburbs to other parts of the city via Behala. It is also part of National Highway 12. Majerhat railway station is located beside the bridge. There is also nearby construction for Kolkata Metro Line 3; a planned station for Majerhat. The bridge crosses the Indian Railways Sealdah South local rail network from Sealdah to Budge Budge as well as the Kolkata Circular Railway lines. Background There has been concern around the time of the accident that in Kolkata, and in wider India, proper road maintenance was not being undertaken. This incident was the third bridge collapse in Kolkata in 6 years. On 4 March 2013, part of a flyover in Ultadanga had also collapsed. On 31 March 2016, part of an under-construction flyover had collapsed in central Kolkata's busy Girish Park area. 27 people had died in the tragedy, leaving 80 people gravely injured. There had been reported concerns about Majerhat Bridge itself. At the time of the collapse the bridge was apparently over 50 years old. In 2010, the Majerhat Bridge had undergone repairs for subsidence. An audit in 2016 flagged the bridge as unsafe. Concerns had been raised in 2018 by police, commuters and nearby residents stemming from visible cracks appearing in the structure. Incident The bridge caved in around 4.45 PM. Videos from the locality showed a portion of the bridge resting on the street below including at least nine vehicles, including a minibus, stuck on it. =Deaths= * Prabir Kumar Dey, a resident of Murshidabad, and a worker on the Kolkata Metro Line 3 project. * Soumen Bag, a resident of Behala's Silpara. * Gautam Mondal, a cook employed in the nearby metro construction project. Rescue efforts The rescue effort was started by the Kolkata Police, an Indian Army unit from Fort William and five special disaster management teams of the NDRF after the mishap. Injured people were sent to nearby SSKM, CMRI and Vidyasagar hospitals for treatment. Aftermath After the collapse, Eastern Railways suspended train services via Majerhat railway station on the Kolkata Circular Railway and Sealdah-Budge Budge lines. Widespread road traffic disruption ensued as the bridge was a major route for vehicles moving between north and south Kolkata. The Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee asked Chief Secretary Moloy Kumar De to hold an investigation committee into the collapse. She had noted that 20 bridges in the city were at risk of collapse. A Times of India article on 7 September 2018 noted that the Public Works Department has admitted that urgent repairs had not been carried out properly, it was noted that patchwork repairs were carried out on the bridge, adding layers of bitumen, and therefore weight, rather than a thorough repair. The collapse led to a rising distrust among the public regarding the safety of bridges in India. The safety of bridges in West Bengal has further come under scrutiny, as there have been 3 bridge collapses in September 2018 alone. Preliminary results of investigations suggest that pollution and poor maintenance contributed to the bridge collapse. Accusations that Metro construction had led to bridge collapse were felt to be unfounded. There have been reports that repairs were hastily completed with claims that \\"a month's work was done in one night\\". The state public works department (PWD) has undertaken a complete tear down of the old bridge and reconstruction of a new bridge at the same location and is aiming to commission the new bridge in July 2020 Reactions * Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal ‚Äì said after the accident that the priorities are relief and rescue with the investigation commencing later. She also announced a compensation of to the family of each deceased, and each to the injured. * Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India ‚Äì tweeted that the loss of lives in the collapse is deeply unfortunate. * Rajnath Singh, Union Home Minister ‚Äì stated that the bridge collapse incident in Kolkata is extremely tragic. * The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited project manager for the nearby Kolkata Metro Line 3 construction works, has denied the metro construction led to the bridge collapse.

Among the proteins encoded by genes that are apparently regulated by sul1 RNAs, the most common protein domains (whose gene is named sul1) is believed to function as a sulfate transporter. Other common protein domains function as Serine O-acetyltransferase, Cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase or glycosyltransferase. It was observed that many of these genes are related to sulfur metabolism or to methionine metabolism, and therefore sul1 RNAs' function might relate to these pathways.

At the time of her 1916 admission to the Hawaii bar, she was the only woman attorney in Hawaii. Almeda Eliza Hitchcock had previously practiced law in the islands while Hawaii was still a kingdom, but had ceased her practice before the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The third woman attorney in Hawaii was Carrick Hume Buck who was admitted to the Hawaii bar in 1924, making Ashford and Buck the only two practicing women attorneys in the territory as of that date.  Family background  She was born December 9, 1891, the youngest child of Jean (Jennie) Eleanor Robertson Ashford (1858‚Äì1926) and Clarence Wilder Ashford (1857‚Äì1921). Her mother was the first woman regent of the University of Hawaii and credited as securing funding for the original Cooke Field at the University of Hawaii.*; Her father was an immigrant from Canada, who had replaced Antone Rosa as KalƒÅkaua's Attorney General after the signing of the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. For his alliance with Lili ªuokalani during the overthrow, he spent seven years in exile in San Francisco, returning to Hawaii after its annexation by the United States.; President Woodrow Wilson appointed him First Judge of First Circuit Court, District of Hawaii in 1914, a position he held until his retirement. Her brothers Stanley Haze Healani Ashford (1888‚Äì1968) and Huron Kanoelani Ashford (1890‚Äì1928) also entered the legal profession.  Education and career  After graduating from Punahou School in Honolulu, Ashford matriculated at the University of California, where she earned her LL,B in 1914. She then spent several weeks in Hawaii accompanying her father in his judicial duties, before enrolling at the University of Michigan, receiving her JD degree in 1915. Territorial Chief Justice Alexander George Morison Robertson administered the oath to her on January 27, 1916, and authorized her to practice in all courts in the territory. At the time of her admission to the bar, she was the only woman attorney in Hawaii, and the first in the territory to practice. Almeda Eliza Hitchcock (1863‚Äì1895) had previously practiced law in the islands while Hawaii was still a kingdom, but had ceased her practice before the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. In February 1916, while still living in her parents' house and being financially supported by them, Ashford acted as the defense in a case in which her father presided over as the judge, raising conflict of interest concerns. By the following month, she had joined the law firm of Castle & Withington. The third woman attorney in Hawaii, Carrick Hume Buck (1900‚Äì1959), was admitted to the Hawaii bar in 1924. At that time, Ashford and Buck were the only practicing women attorneys in the territory. Ashford was appointed First Deputy Attorney General in the territory in 1925, holding the position until 1927. For nearly two decades, she served as legal council for the territorial legislature. In 1934, she was appointed Deputy Attorney General for the whole legislature, holding that position until 1953. She was appointed attorney for the Territorial House of Representatives in 1935, for the purpose of drafting legislation. When she worked as counsel for the Territorial Senate, the newspaper stated that during the period she served in that position, she earned a higher salary than any other public servant.  Public lands  The Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the United States on July 4, 1898. On June 14, 1900, the Hawaiian Organic Act officially created the territory and provided the constitutional framework under which it was governed. With the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921, the federal government set aside approximately in the territory as a land trust for homesteading by Native Hawaiians. Ashford held the opinion that the act discriminated against non- native Hawaiians, and, therefore, violated the United States Constitution. When Ashford was chosen as a delegate from Molokai to the 1950 Hawai ªi State Constitutional Convention, she opposed inclusion of the 1921 Hawaiian Homes Commission Act into Hawaii's new constitution. When the convention failed to eliminate the act from the proposed constitution, she refused to sign it. Governor Samuel Wilder King appointed Ashford to his cabinet as Commissioner of Public Lands in 1953, stirring up public controversy. King never wavered in his support of her, but she eventually resigned from the position.  Retirement  She retired from active law practice, and moved to Molokai in 1946, where she built a home in the Kainalu area. A tidal wave generated by the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake damaged much of the island, and dislodged her new house off its foundation, moving it and her car across the road. In August of that year, she was un-retired by Chief Justice Samuel B. Kemp, who appointed her to fill a District Magistrate vacancy on the island. Ashford maintained close ties with King, but was able to fully retire as his final term ran out. She moved to the Halekou area of Kaneohe to be near her remaining family, and died March 3, 1970.

She earned her diploma from the Salem Academy and served as president of the Southern Women's Interstate Association for the Betterment of Public Schools.  Early life  Lucy Bramlette Patterson was born on August 22, 1865. She was born in her mother‚Äôs family home in Tazewell, Tennessee. Patterson had one older sister.  Education  In 1992, Patterson graduated from Salem Academy, which her mother had also attended. She was the first woman in her family to receive a diploma. She began writing literary articles, which was a family tradition. She used her writing talent to make a career for herself. In 1902 she was president of the academy's alumnae association.  Career  She began her career working for The Progressive Farmer. She also wrote for the Charlotte Observer when she filled in for a columnist during his vacation; as a result, there is an article about her in The Journal of American History. Patterson's column in the Journal Sentinel, \\"Just One and Another\\", contains her common themes of women's rights in business, politics, and the arts and sciences. She may be best remembered for her annual award for literary achievement in the state of North Carolina, called the Memorial Cup. During World War I, Patterson went into the Balkans and wrote about her experiences. Her writings show that she was close with Queen Maria and her family in Romania. Later she was recognized by King Alexander of Yugoslavia for her accomplishments in Serbia. She was also honored as part of Kola Sestera, a group that helped with wartime relief and orphans. She was the president of the Southern Women's Interstate Association of the Betterment of Public Schools in 1907, and spoke at the Pinehurst about these concerns. She also became a chairman for the Interstate Boone Trail Association, when helped finish the Daniel Boone trail that ran through Tennessee to Kentucky. She volunteered for Forsyth Moonlight, which helped train adults for education as teachers, and offered adult education itself. She served on the Jamestown historical commissions.  Personal life  Lucy Patterson was the daughter of Colonel William Houston and Cornelia Humes Graham Patterson. Her grandfather was Major General Robert Patterson, who served in the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and the Civil War. While attending school in Salem she met a lawyer with the same last name, who was not related to her: Jesse Linsday Patterson. He had just finished first in his class at Davidson College. They were married on September 6, 1888. The two had no children, but adopted their two orphaned nieces. Aside from writing, Patterson's hobbies included traveling. She traveled to Egypt as a young girl, and later visited Egypt and Moscow.  Legacy  Patterson left behind many awards in her name, including an award for female writers, the Patterson Memorial Cup. 13 writers received this award from 1905 to 1933, and the award is still given today. Its name was changed to the Mayflower Society Cup, it is still given in her honor.

Element supports end-to-end encryption, groups and sharing of files between users. It is available as a web application, as desktop apps for all major operating systems and as a mobile app for Android and iOS.  History  Element was originally known as Vector when it was released out of beta in 2016. The app was renamed to Riot in September of the same year. Logo of Riot from 2019 to 2020. In 2016 the first implementation of the Matrix end-to-end encryption was implemented and rolled out as a beta to users. In May 2020, the developers announced enabling end-to-end encryption by default in Riot for new non-public conversations. In April 2019, a new application was released on the Google Play Store in response to cryptographic keys used to sign the Riot Android app being compromised. In July 2020, Riot was renamed to Element.  Technology  Element is built with the Matrix React SDK, which is a React-based software development kit to ease the development of Matrix clients. Element is mostly built around web technologies and also uses Electron, a software framework to create desktop applications from web applications, to distribute their desktop clients for Windows, MacOS and Linux. The Android and iOS clients are developed and distributed with their respective platform tools. On Android the app is available both in the Google Play Store and the free-software only F-Droid Archives, with minor modifications. For instance the F-Droid version doesn't come with the proprietary Google Cloud Messaging plug-in.  Features  Element is able to bridge other communications into the app via Matrix, such as IRC, Slack, Telegram, Jitsi Meet and others. Also it integrates voice and video peer-to-peer and group chats via WebRTC. Element supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) of both one-to-one and group chats.  Reception  Element being the Matrix client with the most development has been recommended as a starting point for new Matrix users, even by Matrix itself. In the media, Riot was sometimes perceived as an alternative to Slack, WhatsApp or other instant messaging clients. In 2017, German computer magazine Golem.de called Riot (and Matrix server) as \\"mature\\" and \\"feature-rich\\", while criticizing its key authentication at the time to be \\"anything but user-friendly\\" for many communicatees with multiple devices each. A co-founder of the project, Matthew Hodgson, assured the key verification process was a \\"placeholder\\" solution to work on. In 2020, a cross-signing feature was added to the apps to make the verification process simpler.

He also had set up a war orphans refuge at the old Fossoli di Carpi concentration camp in the Emilia- Romagna region but this was closed in 1952 after ecclesial authorities ordered his departure and the camp's closure. The movement moved to Grosseto after a countess donated land to them to use and Saltini's communal group flourished and grew in numbers despite the Church's severe reservations regarding Saltini's work. This friction led in 1953 to him leaving the priesthood though he was later restored in 1962. Future outlooks on Nomadelfia mellowed over time and even earned papal support from Pope John Paul II towards the end of Saltini's life. His beatification process opened in 2009 after the Tuscan Episcopal Conference issued their assent to the cause's launch; a formal edict issued within the next fortnight launched the cause in Grosseto. Life =Childhood to education= The Saltini's in a photograph dated 18 January 1916. Zeno Saltini was born in Fossoli in 1900 as the ninth of twelve children to the rich landowners Cesare Saltini and Filomena Rigi. His older sister (the third-born) was Maria Anna Saltini Testi (28.8.1889-3.12.1957) who founded a religious order and later was proclaimed as Venerable on the path to sainthood. Three of his brothers would later enter the religious life. In 1914 he decided to cease his studies and refused to return to school because he believed that he had learnt subjects of little relevance to life. He therefore started to work on his parents' land and soon became acquainted with the miseries and the aspirations of fellow farmworkers and landowners. This proved to later be the basis for his life going forward. He later was conscripted into the national service in 1917 during World War I and was posted in Florence. In 1920 he had a profound encounter with an anarchist (also a fellow soldier whom he knew) who in the presence of other soldiers sustained that Jesus Christ and the Church were little more than obstacles to human progress moving forward. Saltini attempted to sustain the complete opposite but realized his educated opponent had the support of most of the gathered soldiers so decided to retreat from the debate before it worsened. This incident humiliated Saltini who locked himself in a room and wept. He reflected upon this encounter and declared: \\"I want to be neither a servant nor a master\\" in the aim that he would change civilization beginning with himself. From that point on he decided to resume his studies and entered into a law course at the college in Milan where he also continued to participate in apostolic activities such as working alongside Azione Cattolica. Saltini also ended up in Verona at some stage alongside the priest Saint Giovanni Calabria whom he befriended while he also got to know the Bishop of Carpi Giovanni Pranzini. He completed his degree in 1929 and set himself on new work in which he aimed to aid those people who were unable to afford adequate legal services. But this too challenged Saltini who soon began to realize his true mission in life was to prevent people from falling into misfortune. He therefore decided to become a priest in 1930. Saltini returned to his alma mater where he underwent theological studies; both Calabria and Pranzini encouraged Saltini in his vocation and aspirations. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 4 January 1931 in the Carpi Cathedral from Bishop Pranzini. He celebrated his first Mass on 6 January at the Carpi Cathedral and at that Mass took Danilo (aged seventeen) as his spiritual son (Danilo had just been released from prison and had nowhere to go). That child served Saltini at the Mass as his altar server. =Priesthood= Saltini's first pastoral assignment was as a vice-parish priest in San Giacomo Roncole near Mirandola. It was there that he started to understand the importance of the cinema as a medium for promoting the Christian message and so opened a cinema there for the people. In 1941 he started to welcome abandoned children as his own and to that end founded the \\"Little Apostles\\" movement in order to care for poor and abandoned children. He also swore that he would never open a college. In 1941 a teenage girl named Irene Bertoni (aged eighteen) ran from home and asked Saltini if she could become the 'mother' of the Little Apostles. He conferred with and received approval from his bishop which allowed for Saltini to entrust the children to her care. It was not long before other women (the first being Maria Luisa Amadei) joined Irene and became known as the \\"mothers of vocation\\". In addition other priests joined Saltini and lived together as communitarian priests. He was a staunch anti- Fascist who opposed their racial laws in the lead up to and during World War II. Saltini found a kindred spirit in the new Bishop of Carpi (and Capuchin friar) Vigilio Federico Dalla Zuanna who was supportive of Saltini's work. Upon Benito Mussolini's dismissal the Carabinieri arrested Saltino for spreading religious leaflets though released him after a few hours in fear of a popular uprising. It was following the armistice in 1943 that he travelled south with some of his children following him in order to escape arrest or potential deportation. He travelled first through Fossacesia in Chieti and then through Rome (where he spent a great deal of time) and then through to Campania. But back in San Giacomo Roncole were those who disliked Saltini and his work and attempted to ensure its dissolution. Some of Saltini's children joined partisan organizations and some of the communitarian priests collaborated with the Italian Resistance to help Jews flee to neutral Switzerland with false identification papers. But the cost proved high to Saltini who learned that seven of the Little Apostles had died. Upon the conflict's end he occupied in May 1947 the ex-concentration camp of Fossoli di Carpi (near Saltini's birthplace) and tore down its walls and fences in order to make a new town. Their constitution was adopted on 14 February 1948 and the group was renamed as Nomadelfia which in Greek meant \\"the law of brotherhood\\". =Nomadelfia= In 1950 Nomadelfia proposed a political movement called \\"movement for brotherhood\\" in order to abolish democratic abuses and maintain ideals central to the democratic concept but political and some ecclesial forces blocked this initiative. In addition the worsening economic condition in the region became more difficult to manage with homeless and abandoned people increasing and with some capitalizing upon this as an excuse to dissolve Nomadelfia. Friction between Saltini and the Church grew in August 1951 when seven friars from the Servites (including Giovanni Vannucci) were commanded to return to their convents after it was found the friars were living among the Nomadelfians. On 5 February 1952 the Holy Office under the leadership of Cardinal Giuseppe Pizzardo - through the apostolic nuncio Francesco Borgongini Duca - ordered Saltini to leave Fossoli di Carpi and he did so in obedience with the camp being dissolved. Due to being forced out of the camp the movement sought shelter in Grosseto on 400 hectares of land that the Countess Maria Giovanna Albertoni Pirelli had donated to them since she was supportive to Saltini's vision. In 1951 he issued a book scathing in its nature: he proposed urgent Church reform and the unmasking of Marxism and Liberalism exploiting the poor which ran counter to the mission of the Church. In May 1952 the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster published a notification that declared his disapproval for Saltini and his Nomadelfia movement. It was soon after this that accusations of fraud were levelled against Nomadelfia but in November 1952 a court in Bologna absolved the movement of the accusations proven to be false and unsubstantiated. =Exit and return to the priesthood= In November 1953 he requested papal permission to leave the priesthood in order to return to the group that he had been forbidden to go back to which then led to Pope Pius XII granting him the secularization \\"pro gratia\\" that 30 November. It was at this stage in 1953 that Nomadelfia had around 400 members. In 1961 Nomadelfia became a civil association and to that end drew up a new constitution. Pope John XXIII restored Saltini to the priesthood on 6 January 1962 (upon a personal request from the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Giovanni Battista Montini) and he celebrated his \\"second\\" first Mass on 22 January. In addition Nomadelfia soon became a local parish in which Saltini was appointed as its parish priest. In 1965 he proposed a new form of apostolate known as the Nomadelfian Entertainment Evenings which consisted of a dance. Further to this was the publication in 1968 of the \\"Nomadelfia is a Proposal\\" magazine issued once a month. The Nomadelfians - on 12 August 1980 - performed for Pope John Paul II in Castel Gandolfo and the pope later remarked: \\"If we are called to be the sons of God and brothers, then Nomadelfia is a presage of the world to come\\". =Death= Saltini died in 1981 in Grosseto due to a heart attack and his remains are buried at the Chiesa Comunitaria di Nomadelfia. Beatification process Saltini in 1974. On 30‚Äì31 March 2009 the Tuscan Episcopal Conference met and provided their assent to launching the beatification cause for the late Saltini; the cause opened a month after on 9 April 2009 after the then- Bishop of Grosseto Franco Agostinelli issued an edict assenting to the cause being launched in Grosseto.

The dogs are born on GDB's campus to one of their breeder dogs and at two months old they are placed with volunteer puppy raisers to continue basic training. The puppy raisers have the dogs between 14-16 months, although puppies can be \\"career changed\\" at any point. Throughout this period of time, GDB's community representatives conduct frequent visits to check in on the puppies' progress. Patriot: Placed with puppy raiser Nick (his 1st GDB dog). Patriot was not behaving well accompanying Nick to high school, so GDB transferred Patriot to puppy raiser Adam (an Iraq veteran). Adam and Patriot form a special bond, as Patriot helps Adam with his PTSD. Patriot is transferred to more experienced puppy raiser Maureen to help him make progress faster. Upon returning to GDB's campus, Patriot trains with Melanie and passes his preliminary guide work test 1. During the next phase of training Patriot struggles a lot, especially controlling how he responds to other dogs, so he is career changed. GDB contacts Adam again to gift him Patriot, for him to serve as his unofficial PTSD dog. Phil: Placed with puppy raiser Patti (her 1st GDB dog). Phil is transferred to more experienced puppy raiser Kristin (her 10th GDB dog) to help him make progress faster. Upon returning to GDB's campus, Phil trains with Adam (no relation to Adam the puppy raiser) but doesn't pass his preliminary guide work test 1. Some weeks later, Phil is retested and passes. Weeks later, Phil takes his final 5 tests, passing all of them. Phil graduates the program and he is matched with Ronald who was waiting for his 1st guide dog. Phil and Ronald bonded well, they go to school together every day and enjoy going on hikes. Poppet: Placed with puppy raiser Cathy (her 8th GDB dog). Upon returning to GDB's campus, Poppet trains with Adam (no relation to Adam the puppy raiser) and passes her preliminary guide work test 1. Weeks later, Poppet takes her final 5 tests, but fails two of them. When retested, Poppet passes all final tests. Poppet graduates the program and she is matched with Janet who was waiting for her 4th guide dog. Poppet and Janet love each other, they go to work every day and Janet says Poppet is the best guide dog she has ever had. Potomac: Placed with puppy raiser Linda (her 2nd GDB dog). At 12 months old Potomac is career changed, as he was struggling with basic training skills, such as ignoring distractions on the floor as he walks guiding a person. Potomac went on to become a pet dog with a family in Oregon. Primrose: Placed with puppy raiser Rebecca (her 7th GDB dog). Having done excellent in the training program, GDB decides to make Primrose a breeder.

They specify the name of the ship, the conditions of employment (including the size and ratings of the intended complement), seamen's compensation (shares or payments), the nature of the voyage(s) and duration,In interpreting the Act, the words \\"nature of the voyage\\" must have such a rational construction as to answer the main and leading purpose for which they were framed, namely, to give the mariner a fair intimation of the nature of the service in which he was about to engage himself, when he signed the ship's articles. and the regulations to be observed aboard ship and in port, including punishable offenses and punishments. Traditionally, each seaman is required to sign the articles, and the articles include for each seaman, his rating, the place and the day of signing on and the place and the date of signing off of the ship. History Ships' articles developed as part of the Law Merchant (Lex mercatoria). Early trading vessels were often cooperative efforts where the crew, or some members, contributed to the initial costs of ship, cargo and operations; and payment was in shares at the end of the voyage. Thus all members of a crew were considered participants in the enterprise, even if they only contributed labour. This became widely recognized under the legal concept of a \\"community of joint hands\\" (Gesamthand in German, comunidad in mano in Spanish). Early ship's articles were not written, as few were literate. But by the eighteenth century most sailors expected the articles to be written, even if they themselves could not read. Finally in the 1800s legislation in many countries required that ships' articles be written down, and freely available to any ensigned sailor. =Privateers and pirates= In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the ship's articles of privateers and pirates evolved into an authority independent of the laws of any nation. Although there was no uniformity among such articles, there were common themes that came to be known as \\"the pirates' code\\" or \\"Jamaica discipline\\". Compensation In addition to monetary payments, seamen on ships traditionally received housing (berth), board (food and provisions), medical care (ship's doctor),Further, the issue of failure to treat is one peculiar to the crew members, bound by ship's articles and their dangerous work at sea to seek from their superiors prompt relief from duty and proper medical attention, hospitalization and nursing care. and sometimes things like laundry services or an alcohol allowance. This as often expressed in the ship's articles as so much \\"a month and found\\". A sailor comes aft to take mate's place, cabin-boy goes for'ard to take sailor's place, and you take the cabin-boy's place, sign the articles for the cruise, twenty dollars per month and found. available at The Sea Wolf, Chapter 3 Usage Ship‚Äôs articles are considered part of a \\"ship's papers\\", which constitute the legal environment aboard ship. They are required in resolving disputes between seamen and their captains, as well as between seamen and the ship's and cargo's owners. They are presented to port authorities and foreign consular officials to establish the bona fides of a ship.

It was previously listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange but chose to be delisted in 2009 while its shares can be traded over the Counter. Founded in 1932, it is the oldest Italian construction company in Nigeria and it paved the way for other Italian construction companies to be established in Nigeria. History Cappa & D'Alberto was established by Pietro Cappa and Viginio D'Alberto in 1932, immigrants from Italy who settled in Nigeria. D'Alberto was born in Roasio and Cappa was born in Gifflenga. Both businessmen had similar path to Africa, Cappa emigrated to British West Africa in 1924 and originally worked in Ghana before settling in Nigeria. While D'Alberto came to Ghana in 1929 before arriving in Nigeria in 1931. Both individuals met in Kaduna in 1931 and a year later founded Cappa and D'Alberto with office in Oil Mill St, Lagos. Grato Cappa, brother of Pietro later founded G Cappa in 1935. Early in its history, the firm was sustained with works for the Catholic mission within Lagos and Abeokuta. It later took jobs far from its Lagos base such as the construction of a government housing project in Yola which was completed on time, and later Yola hospital. The company then followed up with contracts in Sokoto and the construction of a camp in Jos. This jobs sustained the company through the great depression. During World War II, the firm's asset was briefly under the control of British authorities through the custodian of enemy properties, both D'Alberto and Cappa returned to Italy and the remaining Italian employees were interned in Jamaica until the end of the war. The partners returned in 1945 and re-established the firm, after taking control of their remaining assets. In 1950, it secured a lease from Candido Da Rocha to erect a new office in Campbell St, Lagos. The company's pre-independence projects in Lagos included Holy Cross Cathedral and Humoani Mosque which were built in the 1930s and later Kingsway Stores, Maternity Hospital, Lagos Island, Bristol Hotel and Western House. In Ibadan, it built Cocoa House. In the 1950s, the firm delved into the property development sector with the establishment of Igbobi Development Company. In the post-independence period, the firm built supporting housing facilities for construction workers at Kainji dam, NEPA office, Marina, Tafawa Balewa Square and was involved in the construction of the National Stadium at Surulere. The company also built factories including Dunlop in Ikeja and Arewa Textile, Kaduna. The firm's work at Kainji also included New Bussa township and resettlement of residents affected by the dam.

Career  The Mars InSight lander Alibay is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and is a Payload Systems Engineer on the InSight mission, a robotic lander spacecraft designed to study the interior of the planet Mars which lifted off to Mars in May 2018. Before the launch, Alibay was responsible for the proper integration and testing of all the instruments on the spacecraft. While the mission waited for the spacecraft to land on the surface of Mars, Alibay helped the teams prepare for operations and tested the detector equipment. To celebrate the landing on Mars in November 2018, she had her hair dyed red to match Mars and the InSight logo. From 2014-2016 Alibay was the systems engineer on the Mars Cube One CubeSats mission, a companion mission to InSight. After her Master's degree, Alibay participated in the NASA Academy internship at Goddard Space Flight Center, through which she was introduced to the many NASA centers and activities. It was here she discovered her passion for robotic planetary exploration. Alibay has spoken to the value of good mentors when she was an intern, and mentors women interns herself as a result of this positive experience. Her favourite moon is Saturn's Enceladus.

Whiting became at age 52, after which she was in active practice. She also conducted a real estate, brokerage, and insurance business. She was one of the most successful women insurance agents in the United States. She is also remembered for her wide philanthropy. Early years and education Mary Collins was born in York Township, Michigan, March 4, 1835. Her parents were George and Phebe Collins, the former a native of Wilbraham, Massachusetts, and the latter of Enfield, Connecticut. They were New Englanders, who settled in Michigan in 1832. Her ancestry can be traced back to the Pilgrim Fathers. In the paternal line, the ancestry can be traced back to Deacon Edward Collins, whose name appeared upon the records of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1654. Whiting acquired her early education in the district schools of York township and the Normal School of Ypsilanti. Career =Teacher= After completing Normal School, she taught school until she was 19, when, in 1854, she married Ralph C. Whiting, a native of Hartford, Connecticut, who came to Washtenaw County, Michigan with his parents at age 12, the family home being established in Pittsfield. Mr. Whiting was three years his wife's senior. His father, Charles Whiting, was a wholesale leather and shoe dealer at Hartford, and came to Michigan for his health. He purchased a farm of east of Ann Arbor, Michigan, which Mrs. Whiting, eventually owned. At the time of their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Whiting received congratulations from Dr. Henry Philip Tappan, chancellor of the Michigan University, who gave a large party in her honor, the families being warm friends, visiting each other frequently until the removal of Dr. Tappan and his son-in-law, Dr. Franz Friedrich Ernst Br√ºnnow, the astronomer, to Europe. Subsequent to her marriage, Whiting engaged in teaching a private school, having charge of English branches and vocal and instrumental music. She also kept up her literary work, writing for local papers. =Lawyer= In 1885, she began to study law, mainly for the purpose of handling her large estate, of which she took entire control. She entered the University of Michigan Law School, giving it fifteen hours daily to study, and was graduated in 1887, at the age of 52. She entered the practice of law and pled many cases in the courts in the state, including the Michigan Supreme Court. She also handled various real estate matters. She served as executrix of several estates involving large interests, and never had a will broken. For several years, she served as notary public and was widely recognized as one of the most capable lawyers at the bar of this state. She became one of the most successful women insurance agents in the United States. In 1885, she was elected clerk of the Michigan Club Court. =Philanthropist= Whiting established the Mary Collins Whiting Free Dispensary in Busan, Korea, which she termed ‚ÄúA work of love.‚Äù Dispensary work was not only carried on there, but the institution was also a Presbyterian mission. Up to September 1899, 8,500 cases had been treated and had been collected. The institution had become almost self-supporting, but remained a free dispensary for all unable to pay. Among the Koreans, she was styled ‚ÄúThe Princess Whitinski,\\" which name came about in the following manner: Whiting had a picture of herself taken in a full length sealskin coat and chinchilla fur cap and sent to the conservatory by request. The Koreans, from their familiarity with Russian names and titles, and believing that all Caucasian women were princesses with names ending in ski, at once called her the Princess Whitinski, a title of which also indicated the veneration which the native population felt for the founder of the dispensary. Personal life Mary Collins Whiting Whiting remained a lifelong student and reader, with broad knowledge of the history of the world and its literature. Her leisure hours were largely given to research along lines adding to her knowledge of social and economic conditions, literature and history, and of the world's philanthropic movements, continually enriching her understanding of the great movements of the world and the thoughts of its best writers. She had in her home a large number of interesting relics, many of which descended from previous generations, including an embellished powder horn bearing the date 1764, and also the first revolver manufactured by Colt. She also had a work basket that once belonged to Martha Washington; it was a wicker work in the form of a swan and came to her through Lord and Lady Hare's family, to whom Martha Washington had presented it. She celebrated her golden wedding anniversary by taking a trip with her husband to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904. She was just recovering from a broken hip, occasioned by a fall from a carriage, and was still on crutches, but she made the journey, spending many hours on the fair grounds. On January 10, 1906, Ralph C. Whiting died after an illness of several weeks. She died February 17, 1912, Whitmore Lake, Michigan, and was buried in Ann Arbor.

Life and career Hurst was born in 1911 in Newton St Cyres, Devon, where his father was the stationmaster, and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Crediton. He played works and village football and was working as a porter at Tipton St Johns railway station when he joined Exeter City in 1932, initially as an amateur. He made his Third Division South debut in October 1932 and turned professional later that season. He became a regular in the side, was their top scorer in 1933‚Äì34, and scored the winning goal as Exeter beat Torquay United 2‚Äì1 to win the inaugural edition of the Football League Third Division South Cup. He scored 25 goals from 107 league appearances before moving on to another Southern Section club, Watford, in 1936 for an undisclosed fee. Hurst spent only one season with Watford; he scored 14 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions and was sold for ¬£125 to Brighton & Hove Albion, also of the Third Division South. He played little in his first season and appeared in more than half the matches in his second, scoring 11 goals from 34 appearances in all competitions. He joined Aldershot ahead of the 1939‚Äì40 Football League season but played only once, scoring a late equaliser away to Swindon Town, before competitive football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War. He appeared as a guest for Reading in the wartime competitions and played for Aldershot in the 1945‚Äì46 season before returning to Devon where he played for Crediton United. He became chairman of the club but took the blame when a cup match in the 1950s turned into a riot, and Crediton United was banned from football sine die.

Today it is occupied by the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. It was built in the second half of the sixteenth century; the church ‚Äì which no longer exists ‚Äì may have been designed by Jacopo Sansovino.  History  The Ospedale degli Incurabili dates from the early sixteenth century; the first documented mention of it is from 1522. It was established by Gaetano da Thiene with money donated by two noblewomen, Maria Grimani and Maria Malipiero. It was at first intended to accommodate those with incurable diseases such as syphilis, but later ‚Äì like several other Venetian institutions ‚Äì became an orphanage. The first structure was probably of wood. From about 1565 ‚Äì when a request for funds was made to the Senate ‚Äì until his death in 1597, Antonio da Ponte was responsible for the construction of a substantial building with a large porticoed courtyard, in which stood a church dedicated to San Salvatore, probably built to a design by Jacopo Sansovino. It has been suggested that he was also responsible for the layout of the hospital building, which others attribute to Antonio Zentani. In 1807, after the suppression of religious orders which followed the fall of the Republic of Venice and its subsequent fall under the dominion of Napoleon, the structure of the Incurabili became first a civil hospital and then, in 1819, a military barracks. The church of San Salvatore was stripped of its contents ‚Äì which included the altars, marble statuary, and paintings by L'Aliense, Giorgione, Sante Peranda, Tintoretto and Paolo Veronese ‚Äì and was closed; in 1831 it was demolished. Among those associated with the work of the Incurabili in its early years are Ignazio da Loyola, Gerolamo Miani and Francesco Saverio.  Music  As in the other three Ospedali Grandi ‚Äì the Derelitti or Ospedaletto, the Mendicanti, and the Piet√† ‚Äì the young women of the Incurabili received extensive musical education, and gave musical performances which by the eighteenth century had acquired international renown; among those who gave accounts of such performances were Charles Burney, Goethe, Johann Joachim Quantz and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The first documented oratorio performance at the Incurabili was in 1677, of the San Francesco Xaverio of Carlo Pallavicino, who was maestro di coro there from 1674 until 1685. From 1696 until at least 1718 ‚Äì and perhaps until 1722 ‚Äì the musical director was Carlo Francesco Pollarolo. The Hamburg composer Johann Adolph Hasse had associations with the Incurabili for some fifty years, and was maestro di cappella there from no later than 1736. After his departure for Dresden, he recommended that the post be given to Niccol√≤ Jommelli, who was appointed in 1743. Vincenzo Legrenzio Ciampi worked at the Ospedale from 1747 until his death in 1762, initially as assistant maestro di coro under Giovanni Battista Runcher, and then as maestro. He was able to obtain permission to spend long periods abroad, and was in London for much of this time; Gioacchino Cocchi took his place during his absences.

In China, as well as other parts of the world, the disorder is considered a problem. In June 2018, the World Health Organization listed \\"gaming disorder\\" in the 11th Revision of its International Classification of Diseases. According to its definition, it is characterized by impaired control, prioritizing gaming by giving excessive time to games rather than other activities, lack of other interests in daily activities, and the continuation of gaming despite the negative consequences. Possible addictive elements in video games Many video games have no pre-defined endgame. The inclusion of downloadable content (DLC) means the game continues to expand over time. DLC enables developers to expand their games and attract others for a player to play against. There is always another game. Video games satisfy the need of social connections and activities. Today's games encourage players to interact with each other, supporting the societal demand for interpersonal connections. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games are an example of this. Level reward systems are addictive, and provide incentives to the player to level up. In the introductory period of a game, players begin with basic characteristics with regards to attributes and skills. At low levels, it takes little effort to level up and progress. Each new level requires progressively more work to reach. Multiplayer games do not end; this kind of game often encourages players to connect and collaborate with gamers around the world. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games let players connect with each other. Examples include League of Legends and PUBG. Video games often have digital currencies. The more time players spend in a game, the more \\"wealth\\" they acquire. Players use this virtual wealth to \\"purchase\\" new aspects of the game. Rewards are set on different time schedules in video games. Players may be rewarded for finishing tasks within a certain time frame, or might be given bonuses for playing during a pre-determined period. The virtual gaming world continues to evolve, even when players are not online. Even when players are not playing, the game's world may continue to develop. This creates an incentive to keep playing the game due to the fear of falling behind. Top players or teams can receive rewards in real life, as some tournaments offer cash prizes. Video games do not reward short and unscheduled periods of player time. Achieving competency in games requires a large time investment. Casual players will often be unable to catch up to more dedicated players due to their lack of skills or in-game items. Video games can generate strong emotions in players. Addictive games offer unique methods to create emotional connections with players. It is an unconscious decision for people addicted to computer games to spend more time playing when they are emotionally invested in a game. Modern video games are enormous and dense. Many modern games focus on delivering large amounts of content through open-world levels or compulsion loops, allowing the player to delve deeply into a world for long periods of time. Consequences Game addiction can lead to mental and physical problems. In March 2005, a gamer named Zhu was stabbed by a fellow player, Qiu, in Shanghai. Qui had bought a dragon saber sword from the game The Legend of Mir 3 from Zhu on eBay. In 2007, a person died from a heart attack in Jinzhou after playing Internet games persistently during the Spring Festival. In the same year, it was reported that a 30-year-old man in Guangzhou died after playing video games continuously for three days. A 21-year-old woman lost sight in her right eye after overexposure to a mobile video game. In 2015, a thirty-two-year-old man died after playing computer games for three days in a Taiwanese Internet bar. A gamer became paralyzed after he played computer games non-stop for 20 hours at an Internet cafe. In 2019, China set up a curfew, banning minors from playing at certain hours.  Treatment  Treatments may include in-patient intervention programs with a team of mental health professionals are specialized in combating computer game addiction. Wilderness therapy, which is similar to in-patient treatment, provides treatment in an outdoor setting devoid of any technology or electronic devices. One-on-one counselling with a psychologist or mental health professional, experienced in working with computer game addictions, may be useful. Family therapy entails a therapist looking at the family system and how it interacts with family activities. Computer game addiction books are available that allow an individual to self-treat their issues.  Restrictions  The Chinese government, in 2005, introduced an online gaming restriction. This restriction would limit the playing time for players whose age is under 18 to three hours (18 years old is the Chinese legal definition of an adult). If the a player under 18 years of age exceeds three hours of gameplay in a single day, they will no longer be able to receive bonuses for that day. For example, their characters may no longer receive experience points or virtual currency. The Chinese government's Department of Culture required that all the online games published in China to have a \\"Healthy Gaming Advisory\\" on its main loading page. In 2017 Tencent Games restricted young players to one or two hours of playing online games due to concerns about children's development. The New gaming restriction policy set up by Tencent was first applied to the mobile phone online game Strike of Kings Teenagers who are under 12 years old are restricted to playing the game one hour per day, with no online access after 9:00 pm. Teenagers who are between 12 and 18 are restricted to two hours playing a day.

El curandero de su honra by Ram√≥n P√©rez de Ayala. It is awarded to the best narrative work in Spanish published in the preceding year. It has had different sponsors: the founders, the Cervantes Bookstore, the Asturian Center, the City Council of Oviedo (1986‚Äì2009) and the Tribuna Ciudadana cultural association. History The award was conceived with the aim of rewarding the best unpublished novella ‚Äì regardless of whether the author was established or unknown ‚Äì with input from Oviedo cultural figures such as , Juan Benito Arg√ºelles, , , Belarmino √Ålvarez Otero, Jaime Herrero, and Pepe Grossi (who all joined the Tribuna Ciudadana cultural association which was instituted three years later). It was presented for the first time at the Tigre Juan pub, located at Calle Mon No. 16, a meeting place for artists in the old area of Oviedo that was owned by √Ålvarez Otero, the award's first sponsor. In 1986, the Municipal Culture Foundation of the City Council took over the award, expanding its monetary prize and providing it with an organizational infrastructure in order to achieve a greater national presence. Four years later the bases of the contest were modified in order to reward the best first published narrative work, and made the award into the first one that supported, in addition to the author, the publisher who was taking a risk on a writer's first work. Its winners were generally young (although the 26th edition was won by 74-year-old filmmaker and novelist Jos√© Luis Borau). This second stage, in which the award achieved its greatest prominence, lasted until 2003. A new change in the bases led to awards from 2004 to 2007 for unpublished novels by established or well-known authors, but in 2008 it resumed the modality of awarding the best first narrative work in Spanish. The first endowment of this award was 100,000 pesetas; the 2009 award was ‚Ç¨54,000 (‚Ç¨40,000 for the author and the rest for the publisher). The award was canceled in January and was delivered in May of the following year during the Oviedo Book Fair. In November 2009, citing the economic crisis as a reason, the city council announced that it was suspending its financing. Now the prize ‚Äì a statuette inspired by an engraving by the Asturian artist Jaime Herrero and representing the character Tigre Juan ‚Äì is given in the autumn and has no financial endowment. The award was given in 2010 and 2011 at the , and in 2012 at the Traslaburra restaurant in Oviedo.

It was a 1.8 meter long, free-flying, hypersonic scramjet. A scramjet is fundamentally an air-breathing engine that travels at hypersonic velocities. Built in Brisbane at an estimated cost of $14 million, it took approximately 3 years to complete. SCRAMSPACE was supposed to fire at a hypersonic velocity of Mach 8 or 8600 km/hour (5343 mph) but the flight-test turned out to be a failure and the rocket engine and the payload plummeted in the North Sea off the coast of Norway.  Background  SCRAMSPACE was designed and built at Brisbane, Australia. It took 3 years to build and was estimated to cost around $14 million. It was approximated to fly at around Mach 8. It was the first and the largest research project funded by the Australian Space Research Program. A number of ground-based research tests and Mach 8 flight experiments were involved to establish the research project. A number of engineers and PhD scholars were involved in the making of this project. Ground tests up to Mach 14 were performed to assess the scientific and technical parameters of the project. This was followed by flight tests up to Mach 8. The project involved five countries in partnership: Australia, Japan, Germany, Italy, and the United States. It was led by the University of Queensland's Center for Hypersonics.  Aftermath  In August 2013, the scramjet was airlifted to Norway for a final flight test at Mach 8. The engine was fabricated to reach an altitude of about 340 km( 211.266 miles) with the help of a two- stage rocket engine. According to the experiment, on leaving the atmosphere, the scramjet had to separate from the rocket engine and re-orient itself for reentry. The flight -sensor data had to be collected in a three-second window before the scramjet disintegrated on reentry. However, because of some unknown issue in the first stage rocket motor, the scramjet payload could not be delivered to the correct altitude and speed in the flight test conducted on September 18, 2013. The unmanned spacecraft with the payload and the rocket plummeted in the North Sea off the cost of Norway.  Results  The final stage of the project did not yield any hypersonic flight data. However, the ground testing, modelling and analysis were able to provide reference results for future projects. The project provided valuable insight and results pertaining to hypersonic physics, hypersonic combustion, and the performance of materials and components. It set an example for future hypersonic aircraft research.

It is Grade II listed with Historic England. History The earliest record of the park dates to the will of Sir James Belasses in 1636, he left Poor Howdens Farm to the town of Darlington for charitable purposes. In 1850 the trustees of the charity suggested it \\"be used as a park or promenade and a recreation ground for the public at large\\". This was confirmed in 1851 and two years later the park was opened, it was called Belasses Park after its benefactor, then later it was known as People's Park. The South West corner of the park was formerly the grounds of Polam Hall which is now a school. The park is Grade II listed with Historic England and was the first Victorian park in North East England. The park has an aviary whose most famous resident was a parrot called Max who shocked visitors with his swearing. Landmarks The park contains three landmarks; the bandstand is Grade II listed, and so is the fountain. Polam Lane Bridge over the River Skerne gives access to the park and is also Grade II listed. Facilities The facilities are a bandstand, play park, multi-use games area, skate park, bowling green, green gym, aviary and cafe.https://www.darlington.gov.uk/environment-and-planning/parks-and-green- spaces/south-park/ The pavilion has a clock tower, there is a refreshment kiosk dating to 1908 and flower beds with a terracotta jardiniere. To the North there is a lake with three islands, the perimeter of which was planted with poplars. The park has held a Green Flag Award since 2006. Darlington South Park Bowls Club The park is home to a historic and prestigious Bowls Club that was formed in March 1896 (originally as Darlington Park Bowls Club). Although the facility is owned by Darlington Borough Council, the green and changing rooms that are within Clocktower Lodge are run by the bowls club.

The first broadcast was in 1937. The story portrays the visit of Garmon (known as Germanus of Auxerre in the English language) to Britain in 429. In his preface to the drama, the dramatist describes it as an experiment in a vers libre natural speaking drama (\\"arbraw mewn vers libre i ddrama siarad naturiol.\\"). Background Saunders Lewis wrote the drama after the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict in his first trial for burning the Penyberth bombing school, while waiting for the second trial in London. By the time the drama had been broadcast, the author was already in jail on 2 March 1937. Summary The drama begins with Illtud and Paulinus arriving at Auxerre. They ask Garmon to travel to Britain to oppose the heresy of Pelagianism, which is spreading under the influence of the preacher Agricola. Garmon and Lupus, bishops of Troyes, agree to travel to Britain. Garmon overcomes the Pelagians in a public debate and performs a miracle by giving sight to a blind child. King Emrys Wledig (Ambrosius Aurelianus in English) meets Garmon and asks for his help on defending against an army of Picts and Saxons. Under the leadership of Garmon, the Britons shout \\"Hallelujah\\", frightens them, and wins the battle. Quotation The most quoted and recognised part of the drama is the passage with the request for help from Garmon, spoken by Emrys Wledig: : Gwinllan a roddwyd i'm gofal yw Cymru fy ngwlad, :i'w thraddodi i'm plant, ac i blant fy mhlant, :yn dreftadaeth dragwyddol. : Ac wele'r moch yn rhuthro arni, i'w maeddu. : Minnau yn awr, galwaf ar fy nghyfeillion, :cyffredin ac ysgolhaig, : Deuwch ataf i'r adwy, : Sefwch gyda mi yn y bwlch, :fel y cadwer i'r oesoedd a ddel y glendid a fu. =Translation= : My country of Wales is a vineyard, given into my keeping, : to be handed down to my children and my children's children, : as an inheritance for all time. : And look, the pigs are rushing in to despoil it.Mears, Robert.

He had disappeared after going to the park to play a game of chess with Shubin. At the interrogation, Shubin immediately confessed to the murder and showed where he buried the body. During the investigation, he began to talk about another murder committed by him. Every week, he reported on his previous killings, and showed the locations where the bodies were buried. Shubin always disoriented his victims with a strong blow to the head, then bound their hands and feet with wire, and finally strangling them a striker, which he always carried with him.

It later became a cyclist battalion of the Royal Scots, which served in Home Defence and saw action in the North Russia Intervention force during World War I. Between the wars it was reduced to company strength, but just before World War II it was converted into an anti-aircraft (AA) regiment of the Royal Artillery (RA). This served in Anti-Aircraft Command during the Blitz and later distinguished itself in the Siege of Tobruk. It fought through the Italian Campaign and its successors continued in the postwar Territorial Army (TA) until 1967. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. One such unit was the 1st Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteers, a company formed at Linlithgow, the county town of West Lothian (or Linlithgowshire), on 19 March 1860 under the command of Captain Robert Stewart. It was soon followed by companies formed in other towns of West Lothian, and they were combined as the 1st Administrative Battalion of Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteers with Stewart promoted to Major in command on 21 October 1862:Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 301.Grierson, pp. 196‚Äì8.Westlake, pp. 159‚Äì60.Story of the Royal Scots Chapter 18 at ElectricScotland.Army List, various dates. * 1st Linlithgowshire RVC, formed at Linlithgow 19 March 1860 * 2nd Linlithgowshire RVC, formed at Bo'ness 19 March 1860 * 3rd Linlithgowshire RVC, formed at Bathgate 25 April 1860, moving to Torphichen in 1864 * 4th Linlithgowshire RVC, formed at Bathgate 9 August 1862 from employees of Young's Chemical Works under the command of James Young * 5th Linlithgowshire RVC, formed at Uphall 28 January 1870 * 6th Linlithgowshire RVC, formed at West Calder as one company and a subdivision 17 April 1878 When the RVCs were consolidated in 1880 the 1st Admin Bn became the 1st Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteers on 16 March and the individual RVCs became lettered companies, the subdivision of the 6th becoming F Company at Addiewell, the rest of the 6th becoming G Company at West Calder. C Company moved to Armadale the following year. =Localisation= Under the 'Localisation of Forces' scheme introduced in 1872 by the Cardwell Reforms, the 1st Linlithgowshire was grouped with the 1st Regiment of Foot (the Royal Scots), the Edinburgh Light Infantry Militia and a number of RVCs from neighbouring counties into Brigade No 62, which was a purely administrative formation. Under the Childers Reforms of 1881, the 1st Linlithgowshire became a Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Scots on 1 July, and was formally redesignated as the 8th Volunteer Battalion, Royal Scots in April 1888. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1; Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. Under this scheme the 8th VB was included in the Forth Brigade. In 1902 the Forth Brigade was split into the 1st and 2nd Lothian Brigades, with the 8th VB in the 2nd Brigade. =2nd Boer War= Thirty-six volunteers from the battalion served in the Second Boer War, principally with the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Service Companies of the Royal Scots, earning the battalion its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. In 1900 the battalion raised three additional companies: H at South Queensferry, I at Kirkliston, and a Cyclist Company, while F Company moved to Fauldhouse. H Company was disbanded in 1906 and I Company was redesignated H. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the battalion was reorganised to form the 10th (Cyclist) Battalion, Royal Scots of 8 companies with headquarters at Linlithgow.TA at Royal Scots website.London Gazette 20 March 1908. Cyclist battalions did not form part of the TF's divisions but were 'Army Troops' held at Command level; 10th (Cyclist) Bn Royal Scots was under Scottish Command.Conrad, 1914. World War I =Mobilisation= On the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, the battalion mobilised and was assigned to coastal defence at Berwick-upon-Tweed.Royal Scots at Long, Long Trail. Almost immediately, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 31 August, the War Office authorised the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit for each TF unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. They were filled with the volunteers who were coming forward in large numbers ‚Äì 2/10th Royal Scots was recruited in under a week in September ‚Äì and 3rd Line training units were formed in 1915.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Brander, pp. 75‚Äì8. =Coast Defence= From 7 November 1914 the cyclist battalions formed part of the newly-formed Army Cyclist Corps. The 1/10th (Cyclist) Bn Royal Scots was joined at Berwick by the 2/10th in January 1915, and both battalions remained there until April and June 1918, when they were transferred to Ireland. The battalion was finally disembodied at The Curragh on 26 February 1920. A 3/10th Bn was formed in 1915 and then disbanded in March 1916, when its personnel were distributed to the 1/10th, 2/10th and the newly-formed Machine Gun Corps.ACC at Long, Long Trail. =North Russia= By 1918, 2/10th Bn had sent many drafts overseas and was now composed mainly of men of B1 medical category. However, the War Office needed troops for a North Russia Intervention force, and after reorganising as an infantry battalion and being brought up to strength with drafts from other units in Ireland, the 2/10th returned to England in July 1918. It was then shipped to Arkhangelsk as part of the force, arriving in late August 1918. Leaving one company in Arkhangelsk, the battalion operated along a stretch of the Northern Dvina River, south of its junction with the Vaga River. Movement and observation were hampered by marshes and forests, but supported by the Royal Navy monitor HMS M33 the Royal Scots cleared the triangle between the Dvina and Vaga and took a number of villages and prisoners. The strongly fortified village of Pless could not be attacked frontally, so A Company, less one platoon, attempted a flanking movement through the marshes. The following morning the company reached Kargonin, behind Pless, and the defenders ‚Äì thinking themselves cut off by a large force ‚Äì evacuated both villages. The regimental historian describes this as 'a quite remarkable march by predominantly B1 troops'. By late September, with a body of US Army troops, the battalion had reached Nijne-Toimski, which proved too strong for the lightly-equipped Allied force, who established a defensive line. The monitor then had to withdraw before the Dvina froze, and the force was shelled by Bolsehvik gunboats. It withdrew to a second defensive line for the winter. With the help of a Canadian Field Artillery battery it drove off a number of attacks, culminating in a very heavy assault on 11 November. 2/10th Royal Scots was then reinforced by the company from Archangelsk, which had been engaged at Obozerskaya on the Vologda railway line. The force then settled into billets in villages and log blockhouses, while training and raids were carried out on snowshoes, skis and sledges. The Bolsheviks resumed the offensive early in 1919, and A Company had to be sent to reinforce a heavily pressed force on the Vaga, marching with sledges over in temperatures 40‚Äì60 degrees below freezing. The Bolsheviks now had artillery superiority, there was no anti-Bolshevik rising among the local population, the White Russian troops mutinied in April, and the US troops were withdrawn in May. Nevertheless, the force remained in position; 2/10th Royal Scots was relieved by other British troops. The battalion returned by barge to Archangelsk and sailed for home on 10 June. It arrived at Leith where it was immediately demobilised on 25 June. Interwar When the TF was reformed as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1920, the 10th (Cyclist) Bn first formed the 1st (Linlithgow) Light Bridging Company of the Royal Engineers, then in 1921 it became A Company of the 4/5th (Queen's Edinburgh Rifles) Bn, Royal Scots at Edinburgh, with Company HQ remaining at Linlithgow. The 4/5th Bn formed part of 155th (East Scottish) Bde of 52nd (Lowland) Division.Titles and designations, 1927. =14th (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt= During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. The 4th/5th Royal Scots was one of the battalions selected, becoming a searchlight (S/L) regiment in 1938. At the same time, the TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis, so two regiments were formed, with A Company providing the basis for a new 14th (West Lothian, Royal Scots) Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery (RA). The Linlithgow company formed Regimental HQ (RHQ), 39 (Linlithgow) and 40 (Bathgate) LAA Batteries; 57 LAA Battery was raised at South Queensferry on 17 January 1939 and 58 LAA Bty at Edinburgh on 15 May 1939.Frederick, pp. 800, 821.Litchfield, pp. 298‚Äì300. 3 AA Divisional sign. World War II =Mobilisation= The regiment formed part of 3 AA Division covering Scotland. In February 1939 the TA's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 14th (West Lothian) LAA Rgt became part of 51st Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which was formed in August 1939 with responsibility for all of 3 AA Division's LAA provision.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. =Phoney War and Battle of Britain= 3 AA Division was frequently in action during the so-called Phoney War that lasted from September 1939 to April 1940. The first action occurred unexpectedly on 16 October 1939, when enemy aircraft suddenly appeared out of cloud and dived on warships off Rosyth Dockyard, close to the Forth Bridge. Other attacks on bases followed, and 3 AA Division was given priority for new Heavy AA (HAA) guns in January 1940, but only 10 Bofors 40 mm guns and some Naval 2-pounders were available for LAA defence; otherwise LAA defence of Vulnerable Points (VPs) relied on AA Light machine guns (AALMGs). From April 1940 the Luftwaffe turned its attention to the campaigns in Norway and France and the Low CountriesRoutledge, pp. 375‚Äì6. Bofors LAA gun in the UK, June 1940. By 11 July 1940, at the start of the Battle of Britain, 3 AA Division had some 119 LAA guns (mainly Bofors) defending VPs.Farndale, pp. 105‚Äì6. Scotland largely escaped air attack during the Battle of Britain, but in September 1940 the Luftwaffe shifted to night attacks on Britain's cities (The Blitz).Routledge, p. 387. However, even while the Blitz was getting under way there was also an urgent need to reinforce the AA defences of the British bases in Egypt following the entry of Italy into the war. 14th (West Lothian) LAA Rgt, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Gerald Eastwood, arrived in Egypt with 39, 40 and 57 LAA Btys on 3 March 1941 and was sent straight to Libya where it joined 4 AA Bde at Tobruk behind the advancing Western Desert Force.Farndale, pp. 130, 168.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 213‚Äì4.Routledge, pp. 127‚Äì8.14 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. (58 LAA Battery had been transferred on 10 July 1940 to 50th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery which remained in AA Command.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79.) =Siege of Tobruk= German intervention in the shape of General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps quickly turned the tide in Libya. A swift breakthrough pushed British forces backwards. The German columns, heading for the Egyptian frontier, bypassed Tobruk, whose garrison prepared to defend the port. This was invested from 11 April, beginning the epic Siege of Tobruk lasting 240 days.Farndale, pp. 162‚Äì6.Routledge, pp. 130‚Äì3. Brigadier J.N. Slater of 4 AA Bde acted as AA Defence Commander (AADC) for the whole Tobruk area, with RHQ 14th LAA Rgt controlling the AA defences round the perimeter and RHQ 13th LAA Rgt commanding the harbour area. 13th LAA Regiment had previously sent a battery to Greece, so the numbers were balanced by transferring 39 LAA Bty to its command, though in fact batteries were split between the two LAA Rgt HQs for operational convenience rather than strict regimental integrity:Farndale, pp. 165‚Äì7.Farndale, p. 188.Joslen, p. 482.Routledge, Table XX, p. 141.

McEwan Younger) was in the harbour area under 13th LAA Rgt. In April the two LAA regiments and attached independent LAA batteries between them had 18 Bofors 40 mm guns (6 mobile, 12 static) and 42 captured Italian 20mm Breda guns, and all batteries manned a mixture of these weapons. German bombs explode during one of the heaviest air raids on Tobruk. The photograph was taken from a trench adjoining an AA gun. Rommel made his first attack on the perimeter before dawn on 14 April but was driven out by a counter-attack. Thereafter there were a number of attacks on the perimeter, but almost constant air attacks, particularly by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas. The LAA gunners had problems against the divebombing Stukas and the low-flying Messerschmitt Bf 109s, against which the guns' predictors were useless. With the gunsites themselves being targeted, the battery drivers, cooks and clerks manned LMGs for local protection. The Official History records that the AA artillery in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive- bombers'.Playfair, Vol II, p. 158. Luftwaffe casualties were heavy: 53 aircraft shot down and 43 damaged in April, 45 and 56 in May. After that the Luftwaffe switched to high-level attacks. Whereas there were 21 raids by a total of 386 aircraft in April, by July this had fallen to just four raids by 79 aircraft. 4 AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. Despite hits on the gun positions and numerous casualties among the gunners, the RAOC workshops kept the guns serviceable and no gun was out of action for more than a few hours.Routledge, Table XXI, p. 142. During September and October 1941 most of the Tobruk garrison and some of the AA units were relieved, but RHQ and the three batteries of 14th LAA Rgt saw the whole siege through.Farndale, pp. 204‚Äì5. In November 1941 the British Eighth Army began a new offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Crusader), which succeeded in ending the Siege of Tobruk. The first phase of 'Crusader' lasted until January 1942, when Rommel counter-attacked and Eighth Army fell back and dug in along the Gazala Line. There was then a lull in the fighting while both sides reorganised.Farndale, pp. 214‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 78, 140, 151, 197‚Äì205.Routledge, pp. 135‚Äì7. =Gazala to Tunisia= During the Battle of Gazala, beginning on 26 May, Rommel's Axis forces quickly broke into the British position and began attacking the defensive 'boxes'. After bitter fighting in the Gazala Line and the 'Cauldron', Eighth Army was forced to retreat. The British hoped to defend Tobruk as in the previous siege, but this time the Axis forces reached it before the defences were ready, and 4 AA Bde was among the 33,000 Allied troops who were captured in the fall of Tobruk. However, 14th LAA Rgt was not among them, having been outside the perimeter at the time. It was collected by 12 AA Bde, which had been defending fighter landing grounds for the Desert Air Force (DAF) and now fought a series of rearguard actions as the Eighth Army retreated in confusion beyond the Egyptian frontier. The Axis advance was finally halted at El AlameinRoutledge, pp. 139‚Äì40.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 223‚Äì74, 281, 288‚Äì97, 331‚Äì5. After a period out of the line,The regiment disappears from the orders of battle during this period, eg Joslen, p. 484; Eighth Army Order of Battle May‚ÄìAugust 1942, TNA file WO 209/692. 14th LAA Rgt (39, 40, 57 LAA Btys with 48 Bofors guns) was back in 12 AA Bde for the Second Battle of El Alamein. 12 AA Brigade's role once again was to move up behind Eighth Army's advance and defend the DAF's landing grounds as they came into use. The brigade developed a very efficient system of providing rolling support for the DAF's tactical wings as they made long shifts forwards to maintain contact with the advancing army. This involved the Royal Air Force, Royal Engineers' airfield construction teams, and local ground defence units as well as the AA units; all were represented in the joint reconnaissance parties that followed closely behind the leading battalions. They selected new sites for landing strips or renovated old ones, maintaining radio contact through RAF or RA channels with the main body so that movement orders could be passed to the following AA batteries. Movement was usually by 'leap frogging' from previously occupied landing grounds, though sometimes an AA battery was waiting in a hidden concentration area ready to move forward. RAF transport aircraft flew ground staff, equipment and battery staffs to the new locations. Within a few hours the fighter squadrons would arrive and the AA positions were manned. 12 AA Brigade had 20‚Äì30 separate convoys moving on any given day, and by November it was providing cover for six RAF wings and one US Army Air Force Group. As the advance progressed the retreating Germans took greater pains to make abandoned landing grounds unusable; at one field near 'Marble Arch', 2000 mines had to be lifted by the RA/RE/RAF teams.Joslen, p. 566.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 237.Routledge, pp. 155‚Äì7; Table XXIII, p. 161. 12 AA Brigade followed Eighth Army all the way to Tripoli, which fell on 23 January 1943. By now, 14th LAA Rgt (39, 40, 57 LAA Btys, 36 x Bofors) was at Buerat.Routledge, pp. 157‚Äì8; Table XXIV, p. 162. The last phase of Eighth Army's operations in North Africa was the advance from Tripoli into Tunisia. 12 AA Brigade continued to conduct airfield defence, against increasing opposition. The typical mobile group allocated to an airfield contained one HAA and two LAA batteries. To avoid detection, the groups moved by night, being allotted special priority for routes. For the Battle of the Mareth Line in late March 1943 12 AA Bde covered nine forward landing grounds for five RAF wings, all within of enemy positions. The standard procedure was for both HAA and LAA guns to be sited to engage potential attacks by tanks as well as aircraft, and to be tightly integrated with the ground defence units. Air raid engagements could be complicated by the presence of friendly aircraft using the airfield. After Mareth the units of 12 AA Brigade also began to take on responsibility for ports on the Tunisian coast. The advance ended at Enfidaville after seven months and of continuous movement, and the AA gunners began a programme of rest and refitting, while contributing to the AA defence of the ports from which the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) was to be launched.Joslen, p. 485.Routledge, pp. 159‚Äì60; Table XXV, p. 164. =Operation Avalanche= 14th LAA Regiment was not involved in Sicily, but instead sailed with 12 AA Bde direct from Tunisia to the landings on mainland Italy at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) starting on 9 September. The regiment's task was to defend Montecorvino Airfield, but although this was rushed before the Luftwaffe aircraft could fly off, the airfield remained under heavy and accurate enemy bombardment until 13 September and the LAA guns could not be effectively deployed until this ceased. The bridgehead was dangerously congested and so the intended AA reinforcements could not be brought in safely; the units already ashore had to meet all demands against multiple air raids delivered simultaneously with little warning. The Germans were finally forced to retire on 16 September. 12 AA Brigade was keen to follow up quickly with a column of mobile AA troops to Naples, but this bold plan was vetoed. The brigade's units began to arrive in Naples by road and sea (having re- embarked in landing craft) on 1 October. This deployment only lasted three weeks before they moved on again to the River Volturno, where they were required to provide cover for routes, bridges, landing-grounds and field gun positions for X Corps' assault crossing of the river. The Luftwaffe was very active in trying to prevent the crossings, particularly using Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s as fighter-bombers.Molony, Vol V, pp. 276‚Äì84, 289‚Äì92, 298, 322, 446.Routledge, pp. 270‚Äì4.Routledge, p. 283. During 1943 Lt-Col Eastwood was promoted to command 12 AA Bde.Farndale, Annex J.Eastwood at Generals of WWII. Once across the Volturno, operations slowed down as the Allies faced the German Winter Line. 12 AA Brigade's units were deployed around Capua, Cancello and Grazzanise from October to December. Then in January 1944, they moved forward to cover the assembly areas and ferry sites for the crossing of the Garigliano, after which the brigade passed to XIII Corps for the Rapido river crossings and the advance up the Liri Valley (Operation Diadem). Its LAA regiments were committed to bridges, defiles, assembly areas and artillery positions, and enemy aircraft were active in low-level strafing and bombing. There were severe problems in getting the AA guns forward along the heavily congested routes. As XIII Corps advanced on a narrow front, 12 AA Bde found itself stretched along of roads protecting the long 'tail'. After the breakout from the Anzio beachhead and the capture of Rome in early June, 12 AA Bde was deployed in the Tiber plain protecting airfields, river crossings etc.Molony, Vol V, pp. 447, 609‚Äì12.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp, 76‚Äì84, 115‚Äì26.Routledge, Table XLIV, p. 293.Routledge, Table XLVII, pp. 296‚Äì7. In August, 12 AA Bde and its units were transferred to Eighth Army on the Adriatic front. Over the next six months the army advanced only , finally reaching the Gothic Line. During this period the brigade mainly supported I Polish Corps. AA units were hampered by lack of early warning radar, while enemy aircraft were initially very active. However, Luftwaffe activity declined towards the end of the year, and the Allied forces in Italy were suffering an acute manpower shortage, so surplus AA gunners were transferred to other roles and several units disbanded. Although 14th LAA Rgt remained in the order of battle, in common with other units that had been overseas for a long time it returned from Italy to the UK.Routledge, pp. 283‚Äì4.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 371‚Äì2. In the spring of 1945 14th LAA Rgt joined 5 AA Bde in East Anglia.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. After VE-day, AA Command was rapidly run down. In the autumn of 1945, 14th LAA Rgt transferred to 40 AA Bde in Scotland. In April 1946, the regiment was placed in suspended animation.Order of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the TA regiment and its three batteries was placed in suspended animation at Pilton Camp, Edinburgh, where the personnel continued in 14th LAA Rgt as a war-formed unit of the Regular Army, while the TA unit reformed at Linlithgow as 514 (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 1019. =46 Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment= The war-formed unit was redesignated 46 LAA Regiment on 1 April 1947, with the following changes:Frederick, p. 951.46 Rgt RA at British Army 1945 on. * 39 LAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 28 Bty of 27/28 Med Bty as 117 LAA Bty * 40 LAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 253 Med Bty as 124 LAA Bty * 57 LAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 3 Bty of 1/3 Med Bty as 126 LAA Bty The regiment was reduced to cadre on 26 July 1948 and placed in suspended animation on 16 August. However, RHQ and the three batteries were resuscitated on 15 September that year as 46 (Mixed) Heavy AA Regiment at Carter Barracks, Bulford Camp, Wiltshire. 'Mixed' indicated that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit. It was armed with 3.7-inch HAA guns/ This regiment in turn was reduced to cadre on 15 May 1955 at Hobbs Barracks, Lingfield, Surrey, only to be reformed in name on 16 June that year when 75 HAA Rgt (37, 150, 182 HAA Btys) at Milton Barracks, Gravesend, Kent, was redesignated as 46 HAA Rgt (117, 124, 126 HAA Btys). From July 1957 to August 1958 the regiment served at Paphos in Cyprus, with RHQ, 124 and 126 Btys at Pinefields Camp, and 117 Bty split between St Barbara's Camp and Coral Bay. That regiment finally entered suspended animation on 31 October 1958 (117 Bty being formally disbanded on 1 January 1962). =514 (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Regiment= 514 (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt formed part of 62 AA Bde (the prewar 36 (Scottish) AA Bde).Farndale, Annex M.414‚Äì433 Rgts RA at British Army 1945.Litchfield, Appendix 5.30‚Äì66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945. When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 there was a major reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 514th LAA Regiment amalgamated with R Bty of 471 (Forth) HAA Rgt, 519th (Dunedin) LAA Rgt and 587 (Queen's Edinburgh Royal Scots) LAA Rgt to form a new 432 LAA Rgt with the following organisation:Litchfield, pp. 283‚Äì4.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945. * P (Queens Edinburgh, Royal Scots) Bty ‚Äì from 587 LAA * Q (West Lothian, Royal Scots) Bty ‚Äì from 514 LAA * R (City of Edinburgh) Bty ‚Äì from 471 HAA * S (Dunedin) Bty ‚Äì from 519 LAA A further reduction in 1961 saw 432 LAA Rgt converted to the Royal Engineers as part of 432 (City of Edinburgh) Corps Engineer Regiment, except Q (West Lothian, Royal Scots) Bty, which instead joined 445 (Cameronians) LAA Rgt on 1 May 1961 to form R (West Lothian) Bty in a new 445 (Lowland) LAA Rgt. In 1967 this regiment was disbanded and became concurrently part of 207 (Scottish) Bty in 102 (Ulster and Scottish) Light Air Defence Rgt, and T (Glasgow) Bty in the Lowland Rgt, RA (Territorials).444‚Äì473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945.Federick, p. 1014.RA Volunteer Regiments. Uniform and Insignia The original uniform worn by the Linlithgowshire RVCs was dark Volunteer grey, a dark grey cap with ball tuft, and brown belts. The 1st RVC had scarlet piping, the other three had scarlet facings. In 1863 the combined battalion adopted Rifle green uniforms with red facings; the headgear was a shako, replaced by a rifle busby with a black-and-red plume and bugle badge in 1872. In 1876 the lower part of the plume was changed to light green, and the tunic cuffs were changed to rifle green with a light green Austrian knot. About 1890 the brown belts were replaced by black Slade-Wallace equipment, the facings were changed to red piping on the collar and a red crow's foot on the cuff, and the lower part of the busby plume was changed from green to red. This uniform was replaced in 1903 by a drab service dress with red piping and a Glengarry bonnet with Royal Scots badge, buff belts, and black leggings. In 1908 the battalion adopted the scarlet full dress with blue facings of the Royal Scots. Honorary Colonel Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery (the future Prime Minister) held the position of Honorary Colonel of the battalion from 18 April 1874 until 1920.

The objective of the program was to ‚Äúconduct research and development leading to the demonstration of fundamental translational principles of the application of neuroscience-based research and theory to complex operational settings. These principles will guide the development of technologies that work in harmony with the capabilities and limitations of the human nervous system.‚Äù Collaboration Technology and Research Alliances describe cooperative research and technology efforts between private industry, academia, and Army laboratories and centers. This collaboration allows Army researchers and engineers to join academic research developments and industry‚Äôs production abilities and translate them into improving Army capabilities.  History  Major programs of interdisciplinary collaborations between the academic, private, and governmental sectors began at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in the 1990s. In 2010, the Cognition and Neuroergonomics (CaN) Collaborative Technology Alliance was launched and became one of four functioning ARL Collaboration Technology and Research Alliances at the time.  Objectives  The CaN identified limitations in the field of cognitive neuroscience that needed attention. The limited conditions in a laboratory setting could not integrate the spans of physical and socio- cultural factors found in real world environments. Systems that monitor brain and body dynamics that are portable, robust, minimally invasive, and affordable have been underdeveloped. There were not enough software or mathematical models devoted to reporting variations in environment, behavior, and function in real time. The program sought to remedy these problems and leverage the solutions for the benefit of the soldier. CaN established the need for a new experimental environment where multisensory analysis can occur and wearable sensors that monitor brain and body dynamics. Additionally, it called for data sets and development of methods to allow for more in-depth characterization of behavior and variation in cognitive ability, performance, and personality.  Research Thrusts  Three primary research focuses were identified and pursued within the CaN program: Advanced Computational Approaches (ACA) ACA was to develop methods to decode, monitor, and infer state from both neural and non-neural information. As research progressed, it focused on data from Large Scale Integrative experiments as well experimental data sets from the other two thrusts of the CaN CTA. Real World Neuroimaging (RWN) RWN was to assist in studying the brain outside of the laboratory setting. Citation This branch has prioritized engineering and experimental studies with wireless dry electrodes EEG system. This emphasis was made to improve dry EEG systems‚Äô reliability and performance, determine standards of validity for them, and better understand their applications in real world neuroimaging. Another one of RWN‚Äôs research concentrations was studying how stress and fatigue affect behavior in the real world. Brain Computer Interactions (BCI) BCI was established to improve BCI technologies and improve human-robot communication. The poor robustness witnessed in many BCI technologies has been attributed to the ability of neural responses to change over time and that individuals may have different neural outputs to the same stimuli. BCI concentrated on using machine learning and developing an algorithm that would maintain a strong performance BCI technology‚Äôs despite changes in an individual‚Äôs mental state. Other example areas of interest were combining intelligent tutoring with BCI technologies, and improving human- robot communication via rapid series visual presentations with EEG.  Participants  CaN was made possible by the collaboration of the following groups with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory: * DCS Corp (Industrial Lead, Integration Principal Member) * University of California San Diego * National Chiao Tung University (Taiwan) * University of Michigan * University of Texas San Antonio * Carnegie Mellon University * Columbia University * University of Pennsylvania * Johns Hopkins University * University of Maryland Baltimore County * Pompeu Fabra University (Spain) * Qusp * Data Nova  Results  Examples of research results developed by the CaN program include the following: * The identification of a multifocal theta band indicating a loss of balance during a balance beam walking exercise. The knowledge of electrocortical indications for balance loss could allow for a better clinical assessment. Preventative measures could be made for those predisposed to falls who exhibit this neural behavior. * A novel dry EEG electrode providing reliable results when applied to the scalp without any skin preparation. Researchers engineered this electrode to include a sensor-buffer effect, so that the application of force to the electrode against the scalp does not cause pain. * Using fMRI and a novel network analysis algorithm, researchers witnessed autonomy in the sensorimotor cortex throughout the motor learning process. The rate of one‚Äôs learning was due to personalized differences in the frontal and cingulate cortices. * An SSVEP BCI computer spelling program was developed. The spelling program operated at 40 words per minute and at a relatively high information transfer rate. * Electrocortical dynamics were studied in relation to isotonic and isometric lower limb muscle contractions. EEG in combination with an independent component analysis were used as a method of functional neuroimaging to better understand the relationship between muscle activity and electrocortical signals. This EEG/ICA system was reported to predict knee to ankle movements with 80% accuracy. * Results concerning neural network control and brain structure reported the following. Densely connected areas, especially in the default mode system, have a large influence on the transition between cognitive states. Meanwhile, weakly connected areas, particularly in the executive function system, assist in transitioning to difficult-to-reach cognitive states. The integration of various cognitive systems is accomplished by areas of the brain at the boundaries of neural networks, particularly the attentive control systems. * A filter bank CCA-based frequency detection analysis was used to improve the detection of SSVEPs. This CCA assisted in improving the speed of SSVEP-based BCI technology.

The strike was performed by medium and small independent farmers who demanded that the government declare the agricultural sector in state of emergency due to serious deficiencies in production and trade, especially in the potato sector. On January 30, 2018 the demonstrations turned violent and expanded to departments that at first did not comply with the strike, until now the clashes between the National Police of Peru and the demonstrators left two people dead and serious material damage in the entire area. Background Since the rise to power of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2016, Peru was involved in various protests from different areas, such as the education and health sector, the reactions to the pardon to former President Alberto Fujimori at the beginning of January 2018 and, at the same time, the resurgence of the political crisis that plagues the country. The protests germinated when the national potato price collapsed tremendously due to the low prices of the same tuber exported from abroad by free trade agreements (FTAs) signed by Peru. Farmers called for the renegotiation of the FTAs and economic reparations that are caused by the loss of sales. Strike On January 9, the National Commission of Potato Producers announced the start of the strike with quiet protests in several cities of the Peruvian central highlands. After an agreement between farmers and the government, the demonstrations were halted. On January 25, the strikers expected the arrival of government representatives such as the President of the Council of Ministers, Mercedes Ar√°oz Fern√°ndez and the Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation, Jos√© Arista. On the agreed day, however, they did not arrive, and representatives of each state organization were sent in their place, and the strikers announced that, as a result, the strike would restart on January 30 but in a violent manner. On January 30, demonstrators were blocking motorways and burning state installations in all departments, and in this case two deaths and numerous injuries were reported. On February 2 the main stage of the National Commission of Potato Producers reached an agreement with the government to lift the strike. This measure was only made official in the department of Ayacucho and some districts of other departments, this because the other Departmental proceedings are shown to be in disagreement with the ruling. Later in the same month, Ayacucho and other de facto districts would restart unemployment by a strikers majority that did not know what was agreed with the government. On February 11 the Peruvian government managed to reach an agreement to buy the products exceeded the strikers, both the dissidents and the National Commission of Potato Producers lifted the strike.

Garrison was a McDowell County teacher and community mediator, famous for organizing West Virginia's third chapter of the Gary Branch of the NAACP in 1921. Additionally, from 1931-1946, Garrison was the community mediator for U.S. Steel Gary Mines. Some of Garrison's other notable achievements range from establishing the Gary Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to organizing Girl Scout troops for African American girls, to creating a breakfast program from impoverished students during the Great Depression and finally to creating the \\"Negro Artist Series.\\"  Early life and education  Memphis Tennessee Carter was born in Hollins, Virginia on March 3, 1890, to Cassie Thomas Carter and Wesley Carter. Both her parents were former slaves, and later her father became a coal miner. Memphis was the youngest of two children and due to her father's profession, her family spent her childhood in the Southern West Virginia coalfields. Memphis spent most of her days receiving an elementary education from the segregated West Virginia public schools. Later in life, Memphis went on to marry William \\"Melvin\\" Garrison, an electrician and coal company foreman from Gary, McDowell County of West Virginia, on October 5, 1918. Memphis and Melvin never had any children, though if she had it is likely her career would have been shortened due to open discouragement of married teachers with children in West Virginia schools during this time. She eventually received a B.A. with honors from Bluefield State College in 1939, and proceeded to advanced studies at The Ohio State University.  Career  Garrison began her career as a teacher at a public school in McDowell County in 1908 and remained there until the early 1950s when she retired. Although she dreamed of becoming a lawyer, she could not handle the economic cost of the required training, so she was forced to abandon that. While she was a teacher, she also acted as a community mediator for U.S. Gary Steel Mines. She was instrumental in this as she resolved conflicts and complaints for the steel workers. She was also a big influence of the political world of her area. Being the secretary of the Gary Branch of the NAACP, she carried out many big projects and campaigns against racism towards colored people. One of her most famous campaigns was the Christmas seal campaign during the late 1920s and early 1930s. This project emphasized ‚ÄúJustice for All‚Äù and collected big amounts of money for the main office of NAACP, as well as produced widespread support for the organization. Her work in the NAACP also helped to pass an anti-lynching bill in West Virginia. She eventually became vice president of the organization's Gary Branch from 1963 to 1966. She dedicated her later life in her nation and took leading roles in many different organizations for the improvement of her state and nation. She was later rewarded with multiple honors for her dedication and service in the Civil Rights area and her constant battles for alleviation of class and gender racism.  Legacy  While Garrison contributed greatly toward the bettering of race relations during a time of immense segregation, she did not always succeed without repercussions. She received backlash for supporting Joe Parsons, a black man running for Sheriff, and ultimately was suspended from teaching for a year. Garrison notes that she gathered the strength to achieve all that she did and dealt with controversies through her Christian faith. Memphis Tennessee Garrison took the initiative to advocate for her beliefs and lead her community to racial and gender equality during a time when women were given limited rights. It is important to know that Memphis Tennessee Garrison was a successful activist, despite the fact that she had very limited economic resources. Garrison's house in Huntington, West Virginia was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Her house is a potential community house museum for civil rights. According to Owens Brown, the current President of the West Virginia State NAACP, Garrison's house serves as an institution that validates Huntington's black community, as well as a remembrance of Garrison's work and activism.

Career =2000-2002: EE Jump= In 1999, when he was in 6th grade, Goto was scouted by Harmony Promotion while he was at one of Maki Goto's events. He was assigned to a group with Sonim and Ken under the name EE Jump as their lead rapper. Together, they made their first televised appearance on the variety show Warau Inu no B≈çken. Though Ken left the group before their CD debut, EE Jump released their first single on October 18, 2000 with the song \\"Love is Energy!\\" and achieved mainstream success with their summer hit on May 16, 2001. Despite EE Jump's success, Goto disliked performing in the group and was constantly told by staff that he lacked skill in singing and keeping in rhythm. During promotions for EE Jump's fourth single, , Goto had an argument with the group's female manager over their crowded schedules, which led him to physically assault her and check out of his hotel room without permission, fleeing to Tochigi Prefecture. The chief manager of Harmony Promotion, Kaoru Wada, suspended his activities for three months while Sonim continued promoting without him. After issuing an apology, Goto rejoined EE Jump in February 2002; however, shortly after graduating middle school, tabloid magazine Friday published photographs of him drinking alcohol while underage at a cabaret club in a VIP room with a member of Johnny's Jr. Wada warned Goto to keep his personal life private, but when Goto refused, he and EE Jump's music producer, Tsunku, agreed to terminate his contract, which led to EE Jump disbanding on April 13, 2002. =2013-present: Sange and comeback= After serving five years in prison, in 2013, Goto released a memoir titled Sange: Gomaki no Ot≈çto to Yobarete, which discussed his parents' deaths, his relationship with his sister Maki, and his struggles with fame. In 2016, Goto appeared as a hair model, representing the salon Gossip Hair. In 2017, Goto appeared as a guest on the web talk show Imada- Higashi no Curricular, making his first televised appearance in 15 years. In 2018, he appeared again on the show's second season.  Personal life  Goto's older sister is singer Maki Goto, a former member of Morning Musume. In 1996, while Goto was on a hiking trip in the mountains with his father and a family friend, his father died from a fall. Goto himself had noticed it first, as he had stated, \\"Hey, didn't you hear a loud thump just now?\\" Goto dropped out of high school in the middle of his first year. In 2005, he married a non- celebrity woman whose name was not disclosed. Goto has several tattoos, receiving his first one, a carp on his neck, when he was 20 years old. On October 20, 2007, Goto was arrested and plead guilty for breaking into a construction site in Edogawa, Tokyo on July 15, 2007 and stealing 80 reels of electric cable worth approximately ¬•1 million. His accomplices included two of his friends, who were 18 and 19 years old respectively. He was identified by the police by his tattoos. He was sentenced to five and a half years in jail by the Tokyo District Court in May 2008. On January 23, 2010, Goto's mother, Tokiko Goto, fell from the third story of their house in Edogawa, Tokyo at 11 PM.

O'Berry was a native to North Carolina, growing up in Edgecombe County on a farm with her family. She was involved in women's clubs and an open member of the Democratic party. More specifically, O‚ÄôBerry's endeavors in the North Carolina Emergency Relief Association, North Carolina Democratic Party, League of Women Voters, and the Women's Missionary Society at her local Presbyterian Church demonstrated her dedication to serving her community. As an academic, O'Berry was named the first honor graduate from Peace University.  Early life and education  Annie Land O‚ÄôBerry was born on May 28, 1885, in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, to V.W. and Mary Dawson Mayo Land. O‚ÄôBerry grew up on her family plantation and enjoyed playing outdoor sports until the age of 13, when her parents died and she moved to live with her older sister in Littleton. From a young age, O‚ÄôBerry was interested in and excelled at school. In grammar school O‚ÄôBerry attained high marks and continued on to study at Littleton College. She then attended the William Peace University, graduating as the first honor graduate. After graduation, O‚ÄôBerry moved in with her brother, Edward Land, in Kinston. There, O‚ÄôBerry was an active member of the Presbyterian Church where she organized Sunday School and was chairman of the Women's Missionary Society. On December 14, 1909, Annie Land married Thomas O‚ÄôBerry and soon after they moved to Goldsboro, North Carolina. Throughout her career, O‚ÄôBerry advocated for education and aspired to end adult illiteracy. In addition, as O‚ÄôBerry focused on relief in her own community, she took a course on social work at Columbia University.  Philanthropy  While living with her brother in Kinston, Annie Land O‚ÄôBerry was very active in the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs. She became the first chairman of the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of Wayne County where she was the president for two years. O‚ÄôBerry gave her time and effort to what was then called the Charity Organization of Goldsboro. She later went to Columbia University in order to learn more about this type of work. O‚ÄôBerry also helped her father-in-law, Captain Nathan O‚ÄôBerry of Goldsboro, raise over $5,000.00 to help white collar people during the depression. As a result, Governor Angus McLean appointed her to the Commission to Study County Government and the North Carolina Historical Commission. O‚ÄôBerry also worked in the Goldsboro Club in Women's Club Work. She was elected vice-president of the State Federation in 1923 and, in 1927, was elected president. O‚ÄôBerry's literacy committee sponsored an Educational Pilgrimage to Washington. It was recognized as one of the most outstanding projects of adult education in the United States. She was later named the vice-chair of the state executive committee of the Democratic Party in 1930. Three years later, in 1933, O‚ÄôBerry became one of the few women to administer a state emergency relief agency as she became the administrator of the Civil Works Commission. The Civil Works Commission later became the North Carolina Emergency Relief Administration (NCERA). O‚ÄôBerry continued to remain in-charge of an offshoot of NCERA, called the Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, until her death. This offshoot provided loans to farmers. Through her diplomacy, O‚ÄôBerry provided both direct and indirect relief to many citizens.  Legacy  Annie Land O‚ÄôBerry worked to help clubwomen overcome indifference to civic responsibility. She inspired them to be civic-minded and to work for the advancement of adult education. She was viewed as ‚Äòthe little soldier,‚Äô ‚Äòrelief lady,‚Äô and a symbol of ‚Äòfood for the hungry, homes for the weary and a new chance for the discouraged.‚Äô Although she had no children of her own, O‚ÄôBerry raised her grand-nephew and grand-niece as her own.

G. Adams (February 17, 1885 ‚Äì August 29, 1940) was a dean at Howard University College of Medicine from 1929 until his death, in 1940. He was the first African American to hold the position of dean of the College of Medicine at Howard University.  Early life  Adams was born in Delaplane, Virginia. He received his early education at a country school run by his uncle, Robert Adams. His grandmother, Amanda Adams, was a midwife who assisted a Dr. Green in delivering babies. She shared with Dr. Green her knowledge of herbal medicine and inspired his scientific interest and collection of herbs. When Adams was thirteen, his family moved to Steelton, Pennsylvania, where he bought a second-hand cornet with he learned to play with the help of a storekeeper. His musical skill allowed hime to play in orchestras, such as the Lyric Orchestra and Louis Brown's Orchestra, to help pay for tuition in high school, college, and medical school. Adams married Osceola Macarthy Adams, one of the founders of Delta Sigma Theta. Adams was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.  Education  Adams attended public school in Steelton, Pennsylvania, and graduated from high school in 1905. In 1907, he left the state to enroll in Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1911, he received a B.A. degree magna cum laude from Howard. A year later, he received a M.A. degree in chemistry from Columbia University, and in 1924, received his M.D. from the Rush Medical School of the University of Chicago.  Career  Adams' teaching career began after he graduated high school. He spent a year substitute-teaching in Steelton, Pennsylvania, then taught seventh grade for a year in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. After earning his master's degree in chemistry the following year, he sat on the faculty board of the chemistry department at Howard. By 1918, he had progressed from assistant to associate professor. In 1919, Adams decided an education in chemistry was not sufficient for his career and resigned as chair of the chemistry department to pursue a medical degree. After graduating from medical school, he interned in a St. Louis, Missouri hospital. He also taught neurology and psychiatry to nursing students at Provident Hospital. He served as assistant medical director of the Victory Life Insurance Company from 1927 to 1929. In 1929, he was made a dean of Howard University, the first African American dean at the Howard University School of Medicine. As dean, Adams significantly changed the curriculum at Howard University. He hired highly trained professors by offering generous starting salaries. He increased the acceptance standards for students to the university. He received criticism for this decision, but ultimately, his claim of educating students to their highest potential was proven true; of the last four classes that Adams admitted, no student failed annual board examinations, while in the past, at least one student failed each year. In his final years as dean, he proposed the integration of Howard University and Freedman's Hospital. In 1937, the secretary of the department performed an analysis that supported the prospective merger. The department thus decided Howard Medical School should take control of Freedman's Hospital. After some initial protest, primarily from the city's Medico-Chirurgical Society, the transfer of Freedmen's Hospital to Howard Medical School was completed in 1940.  Legacy  Aside from his positions as dean at Howard University School of Medicine the Provident Hospital School of Nursing, he served as a member of the National Medical Association, the board of directors of the Tuberculosis Association of the District of Columbia, the Advisory Health Council of Washington, the Council on Social Agencies, and the Cook County Physicians Association in Illinois. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences.

It is used to determine which global states can be reached by a distributed system which consists of a certain number of local entities that communicated by the exchange of messages.  Overview  Reachability analysis was introduced in a paper of 1978 for the analysis and verification of communication protocols.. This paper was inspired by a paper by Bartlett et al. of 1968 K.A. Bartlett, R.A. Scantlebury and P.T. Wilkinson, A note on reliable full-duplex transmission over half- duplex links, C.ACM 12, 260 (1969). which presented the alternating bit protocol using finite-state modeling of the protocol entities, and also pointed out that a similar protocol described earlier had a design flaw. This protocol belongs to the Link layer and, under certain assumptions, provides as service the correct data delivery without loss nor duplication, despite the occasional presence of message corruption or loss. For reachability analysis, the local entities are modeled by their states and transitions. An entity changes state when it sends a message, consumes a received message, or performs an interaction at its local service interface. The global state s = (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, medium) of a system with n entities Note: In the case of protocol analysis, there are normally only two entities. is determined by the states s_i (i=1, ... n) of the entities and the state of the communication medium. In the simplest case, the medium between two entities is modeled by two FIFO queues in opposite directions, which contain the messages in transit (that are sent, but not yet consumed). Reachability analysis considers the possible behavior of the distributed system by analyzing all possible sequences of state transitions of the entities, and the corresponding global states reached Note: The corruption or loss of a message is modeled as a state transition of the medium. . The result of reachability analysis is a global state transition graph (also called reachability graph) which shows all global states of the distributed system that are reachable from the initial global state, and all possible sequences of send, consume and service interactions performed by the local entities. However, in many cases this transition graph is unbounded and can not be explored completely. The transition graph can be used for checking general design flaws of the protocol (see below), but also for verifying that the sequences of service interactions by the entities correspond to the requirements given by the global service specification of the system .  Protocol properties  Boundedness: The global state transition graph is bounded if the number of messages that may be in transit is bounded and the number states of all entities is bounded. The question whether the number of messages remains bounded in the case of finite state entities is in general not decidable M.G.Gouda, E.G.Manning, Y.T.Yu: On the progress of communication between two finite state machines, doi . One usually truncates the exploration of the transition graph when the number of messages in transit reaches a given threshold. The following are design flaws: * Global deadlock: The system is in a global deadlock if all entities wait for the consumption of a message and no message is in transit. Absence of global deadlocks can be verified by checking that no state in the reachability graph is a global deadlock. * Partial deadlocks: An entity is in a deadlocked state if it waits for the consumption of a message and the system is in a global state where such a message is not in transit and will never be sent in any global state that can be reached in the future. Such a non-local property can be verified by performing model checking on the reachability graph. * Unspecified reception: An entity has an unspecified reception if the next message to be consumed is not expected by the behavior specification of the entity in its current state. The absence of this condition can be verified by checking all states in the reachability graph.  An example  The diagram shows two protocol entities and the messages exchanged between them. The diagram shows two finite state machines that define the dynamic behavior of the respective protocol entities. This diagram shows a state machine model of the global system consisting of the two protocol entities and two FIFO channels used for the exchange of messages between them. As an example, we consider the system of two protocol entities that exchange the messages ma, mb, mc and md with one another, as shown in the first diagram. The protocol is defined by the behavior of the two entities, which is given in the second diagram in the form of two state machines. Here the symbol \\"!\\" means sending a message, and \\"?\\" means consuming a received message. The initial states are the states \\"1\\". The third diagram shows the result of the reachability analysis for this protocol in the form of a global state machine. Each global state has four components: the state of protocol entity A (left), the state of the entity B (right) and the messages in transit in the middle (upper part: from A to B; lower part: from B to A). Each transition of this global state machine corresponds to one transition of protocol entity A or entity B. The initial state is [1, - - , 1] (no messages in transit). One sees that this example has a bounded global state space - the maximum number of messages that may be in transit at the same time is two. This protocol has a global deadlock, which is the state [2, - - , 3]. If one removes the transition of A in state 2 for consuming message mb, there will be an unspecified reception in the global states [2, ma mb ,3] and [2, - mb ,3].  Message transmission  The design of a protocol has to be adapted to the properties of the underlying communication medium, to the possibility that the communication partner fails, and to the mechanism used by an entity to select the next message for consumption. The communication medium for protocols at the Link level is normally not reliable and allows for erroneous reception and message loss (modeled as a state transition of the medium). Protocols using the Internet IP service should also deal with the possibility of out-of-order delivery. Higher-level protocols normally use a session-oriented Transport service which means that the medium provides reliable FIFO transmission of messages between any pair of entities. However, in the analysis of distributed algorithms, one often takes into account the possibility that some entity fails completely, which is normally detected (like a loss of message in the medium) by a timeout mechanism when an expected message does not arrive. Different assumptions have been made about whether an entity can select a particular message for consumption when several messages have arrived and are ready for consumption. The basic models are the following: * Single input queue: Each entity has a single FIFO queue where incoming messages are stored until they are consumed. Here the entity has no selection power and has to consume the first message in the queue. * Multiple queues: Each entity has multiple FIFO queues, one for each communicating partner. Here the entity has the possibility to decide, depending on its state, from which queue (or queues) the next input message should be consumed. * Reception pool: Each entity has a single pool where received messages are stored until they are consumed. Here the entity has the power to decide, depending on its state, which type of message should be consumed next (and wait for a message if none has been received yet), or possibly consume one from a set of message types (in order to deal with alternatives). The original paper identifying the problem of unspecified receptions P. Zafiropulo, C. West, H. Rudin, D. Cowan, D. Brand : Towards analyzing and synthesizing protocols, IEEE Transactions on Communications ( Volume: 28, Issue: 4, Apr 1980 ) , and much of the subsequent work, assumed a single input queue Note: The SAVE construct of SDL can be used to indicate that certain types of messages should not be consumed in the current state, but saved for future processing. . Sometimes, unspecified receptions are introduced by a race condition, which means that two messages are received and their order is not defined (which is often the case if they come from different partners). Many of these design flaws disappear when multiple queues or reception pools are used M.F. Al-hammouri and G.v. Bochmann : Realizability of service specifications, Proc. System Analysis and Modelling (SAM) conference 2018, Copenhagen, LNCS, Springer . With the systematic use of reception pools, reachability analysis should check for partial deadlocks and messages remaining forever in the pool (without being consumed by the entity) C. Fournet, T. Hoare, S. K. Rajamani, and J. Rehof : Stuck-free Conformance, Proc. 16th Intl. Conf. on Computer Aided Verification (CAV‚Äô04), LNCS, vol. 3114, Springer, 2004  Practical issues  Most of the work on protocol modeling use finite-state machines (FSM) to model the behavior of the distributed entities (see also Communicating finite-state machines). However, this model is not powerful enough to model message parameters and local variables. Therefore often so-called extended FSM models are used, such as supported by languages like SDL or UML state machines. Unfortunately, reachability analysis becomes much more complex for such models. A practical issue of reachability analysis is the so-called ‚Ä≥state space explosion‚Ä≥. If the two entities of a protocol have 100 states each, and the medium may include 10 types of messages, up to two in each direction, then the number of global states in the reachability graph is bound by the number 100 x 100 x (10 x 10) x (10 x 10) which is 100 million. Therefore a number of tools have been developed to automatically perform reachability analysis and model checking on the reachability graph. We mention only two examples: The SPIN model checker and a toolbox for the construction and analysis of distributed processes.

He was largely unknown to the general public during his lifetime, due to the unconventional style and subject matter, which diverged from official expectations. Gudzenko was rediscovered in the 2000s.  Biography  Gudzenko was born in Cherkasy, Ukraine in 1938. During his lifetime, Gudzenko's attempts to exhibit his work were criticized, both by official authorities and by colleagues in the shop. Later, the artist was accused of Jewish cosmopolitanism, in particular, for the work \\"Self-Portrait in a Yarmulke\\", exhibited in the Cherkasy Gallery in 1980. Gudzenko had only one personal exhibition, in 1987. His art is really his work only after his death. In many respects, it is the merit of his faithful and persistent admirers who managed to organize his first personal exhibition in 2007 (a year after his death), which took place in his hometown, at the Cherkasy Art Museum. In 2008, his works were shown in Kyiv. In 2014-2015, Russian connoisseurs of fine arts were able to get acquainted with the works of the Ukrainian artist for the first time. This became possible thanks to the exhibition of his works, which were presented to the general public in the Marble Hall of the Russian Museum, in St. Petersburg. In 2017, a solo exhibition was held in the halls of the art gallery of Zurab Tsereteli, the department of the Russian Academy of Arts, in Moscow. The retrospective exposition presented more than 70 works. The exhibition consisted of several thematic blocks and covered the artist's work from early sketches of the late 1950s, graphic sketches, to his latest canvases of the early 2000s. On meter canvases landscapes and still lifes, portraits, genre scenes and decorative fantasies. Art historians note that for the works of this provincial artist such features are inherent, such as - a broad brush, a pasty brushstroke, an open color. His works are fundamentally different from ethnographic painting and from the official art of that period.  Reception  > Alexander Yakimovich ( Doctor of Arts, Art historian, and full member of the > Russian Academy of Arts ) : \\"Looking at his paintings and drawings, one would be hard put to guess that the person who created them had such a hard life. In his works Gudzenko appears to be a free artist in the very same sense as was posited by the Renaissance artists. The artist, inexorably greedy for visual impressions, was passionately emotional and ready to splash onto a canvas his impressions and experiences. The artist‚Äôs eye was designed in such a way that he saw drama and comedy and tragedy in combinations of color hues; he saw irony and sarcasm in the texture of a brushstroke, in combinations of forms. His soul and mind were directly connected to his eye, and his eye to his hand. The free and creative nature, as described in Goethe‚Äôs Faust, is a curious and mistrustful personality that looks intently at real life and reveals its hidden aspects to people. It has no fear, and refuses to consider standards, prohibitions, and canons of official ideologies as something binding.\\"  Exhibitions  = Personal exhibitions = * 2007 - \\"Eduard Gudzenko. 1938-2006 ¬ª, Cherkassy, Museum of Fine Arts, September 19 - September 29 * 2008 - \\"Eduard Gudzenko. 1938-2006 ¬ª, Kyiv, National Union of Artists of Ukraine, March 13 - March 24 * 2014-2015 - \\"Eduard Gudzenko. 1938-2006 ¬ª, St. Petersburg, Russian Museum, December 18 - February 16 * 2017 - \\"Eduard Gudzenko. 1938-2006 \\", Moscow, Russian Academy of Arts, February 28 - March 26 = Collective exhibitions = * 1966 - Republican exhibition of works by young artists of the Ukrainian SSR, Kyiv * 1987 - Exhibition of works by young artists Yevgeny Nayden, Eduard Gudzenko, Sergei Sosulin in the Cherkasy organization of the Union of Artists of Ukraine of the Ukrainian SSR, Cherkassy.

Now, Forager, billed as \\"A film about love and fungi\\", presents the story of a couple, Regina (Tiffany Esteb) and Lucien (Jason Cortlund, who also wrote and co-directed), who forage for wild mushrooms in forests and sell them door to door to Manhattan restaurants. As well as being mycologicists (experts on fungi), both are also expert chefs and slow food aficionados. As their relationship develops, Regina takes a better-paying job at a restaurant, which strains the couple's relationship. A cross-country road trip planned by Lucien ends poorly in New Jersey, and Lucien ‚Äì from financial desperation ‚Äì takes a catering job, where his dilettante client's interferences drive him to inner rage. Roger Ebert described Now, Forager as \\"An uncompromising film about two people who don't deserve each other ‚Äî but maybe nobody deserves either one of them\\", enthusing that \\"The images of wild mushrooms... and the shots of food prep by cinematographer Jonathan Nastasi, approach art\\". The original screenplay was also by Cortlund, himself an amateur mycologist and member of the New York Mycological Society. The title directly references Walt Whitman's American transcendentalist poem \\"The Untold Want\\" from Leaves of Grass‚Äîand less directly the 1942 Bette Davis and Paul Henreid vehicle, Now, Voyager..

She was given the honor of \\"heroine\\", and is known as a \\"warrior\\" and a \\"martyr\\". Early life Ana Mar√≠a was the daughter of Domingo Jos√© de Campos y Perozo de Cervantes, and Mar√≠a Ana Cubill√°n de Fuentes y Vera. From a young age she was a supporter of the expulsion of the Spanish government. She came from one of the most aristocratic families in the region, and received the limited education that was traditional for women in such families, which was primarily restricted to the study of Catholicism. Despite this, she became learned in the arts of society and even in the chivalric code, becoming \\"known as an accomplished Amazona\\". Within high society, Ana Mar√≠a was indirectly exposed to the writings and liberal thoughts of the Age of Enlightenment, and from a young age was reported as having \\"a thirst for liberty, equality and fraternity\\", a thirst which would give her reason to resist the Royalist counter-coup of 1821-23. Resistance campaigns and arrest Sympathetic to, and then active in, independence causes from childhood, Ana Mar√≠a opened up the rooms of her large family home for the organisation of these forces, and plotted with them. She is perhaps best known for her actions during the Royalist occupation of Lake Maracaibo, headed up by Field Marshal Francisco Tom√°s Morales. After hearing of Ana Mar√≠a's attempts to aid the revolution, in September 1822, Morales accused her of organising clandestine meetings to overthrow the crown and had her arrested. One of the pieces of evidence given was something she said in one of the secret meetings: \\"Si Morales no capitula, monda!\\" ‚Äî in the vernacular of the time, \\"If Morales does not surrender, he dies\\". She was personally questioned by Morales and confessed to saying the phrase, which had already become a popular chant in Maracaibo. She refused to apologise to Spain, and was convicted and sentenced to a \\"public flagellation\\". This entailed riding through the streets topless, specifically on a donkey instead of on horseback, turning the symbol into one of disgrace. She was lashed at the same time by the public executioner, Valent√≠n Aguirre. It is reported that after every lash he asked her if she wanted to repent, and every time she answered, \\"Si no capitula, monda\\". After enduring the torture, she was released. However, the injuries sustained would eventually be the cause of her death. Battle of Lake Maracaibo Though beaten, Ana Mar√≠a lived several years longer. The year after her arrest and torture, the battle that she had sought for happened, the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, on July 24, 1823. Still weak from the torture, she took a supporting role in the battle. The revolutionaries won the battle, securing independence for Maracaibo, and forcing Morales to surrender. Death Ana Mar√≠a died at age 32, five years after the victory at Lake Maracaibo, from an epileptic seizure that came about from her torture injuries, on the shores of Lake Maracaibo on October 17, 1828. Legacy Numerous sites in Maracaibo are named for Ana Mar√≠a, including a street, a public square, a training center for women inmates, and a petrochemical complex. A monument in the public square bearing her name depicts Ana Mar√≠a riding topless on a donkey as a man wields a whip behind her. In areas of Zulia, the state of Ana Mar√≠a's birth, the bicentennial of her birth was celebrated with a large festival. There was also a push to create more biographies of her at this time, and the Ana Mar√≠a Campos Orchestra was formed. A popular tune in Venezuela was composed and dedicated to Ana Mar√≠a, and is used to commemorate her. It is called the \\"Canci√≥n de primavera\\", which translates as \\"Spring Song\\". In 2016, the Legislative Council of Zulia established the Order Ana Mar√≠a Campos, which is bestowed annually on local women \\"who actively fight for gender equality and women's empowerment in the different social branches of the country\\".

Between June 2002 and November 2004, he killed 9 men and 5 women in Krasnoyarsk and its suburbs on the basis of personal hostility, also raping two girls aged between 12 and 16.  Biography  Zamanov was born in Tajikistan, but since 1993 he has lived in Krasnoyarsk. He killed his victims in suburban areas, in public gardens, near cafes and roads, with the first murder committed at a cemetery. \\"At the same time he used knives and household items\\", the press release said. The bloodiest of the attacks occurred in November 2004, when he murdered five women in a village in the Mansky District. Zamanov killed them with the help of improvised weaponry. In all cases, the criminal fled the scene, taking all valuables and gold jewelry from the victims. In addition, the investigation found that Zamanov, who was living in the Beryozovsky District, had been in sexual relations with two sisters who were minors. Zamanov was characterized by his unpredictability and extreme cruelty - 6 of the 14 murders he committed all in one day. As a murder weapon, he used improvised items - stones, knives, victims' clothing. He never planned the murders and attacked at random, laughing at his victims while abusing them (especially the women). Zamanov's motive is quite rare - resentment, anger and a strong and sudden irrational hatred for the victims. Rape was only an additional motive and did not always take place. Zamanov's last killing spree was the 6 murders in one day, which occurred in a summer cottage. Witnesses were able to described a man of Asian appearance, and the militsiya had the opportunity to make a facial composite, indicating important features. Meanwhile, the killer's talkativeness caught up to him - he told about the murders to his female partner, who filed a complaint to the authorities. He resisted during his arrest. He did not admit guilt even at the trial, continuing to claim that he was provoked in each case. In 2006, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

He worked under Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the alleged top leader of the CJNG. Arzola Ortega began his criminal career in 1998 as a cargo truck thief and eventually joined the Milenio Cartel, the predecessor group of the CJNG. After several of his bosses were arrested and/or killed, he founded the CJNG with other defectors in the 2010s. Arzola Ortega was responsible for leading a squad of assassins in multiple municipalities across Jalisco to fight off La Resistencia, a rival group of the CJNG. He used a network of police officers to grant protection to his operations and facilitate his drug- related activities. In 2011, he was arrested by the Mexican Federal Police and charged with drug trafficking, organized crime involvement, and possession of military-exclusive firearms. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2015, and was serving his sentence at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico. He was released in late 2018 and killed in Jalisco in 2019. Early life and career Mart√≠n Arzola Ortega, commonly referred to by his alias El 53, was a born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, on . He had other aliases like El Gordo (English: Fatty), El Se√±or (English: The Guy), and El Negro (English: The Black One). Arzola Ortega started his criminal career in 1998 by stealing cargo trucks. He was arrested and sentenced to eight months for this crime. Upon his release from prison, he continued his criminal activity and joined the Milenio Cartel, a criminal group based in Michoac√°n. While he was in the Milenio Cartel, the criminal group worked closely with the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal group based in Sinaloa, and specifically with one of their suspected leaders, Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Coronel Villarreal. The Milenio Cartel was headed by √ìscar Orlando Nava Valencia (alias \\"El Lobo\\"), who had close ties with Coronel Villarreal. In the late 2000s, several members of the Milenio Cartel were arrested and/or killed by security forces, which prompted an organizational rupture in the criminal group. On 28 October 2009, El Lobo was arrested by the Army in Guadalajara. Several months later on 9 May 2010, security forces arrested Juan Carlos Nava Valencia (alias \\"El Tigre\\") and his sister Jacqueline Patricia Nava Valencia in Guadalajara. Later that year, Coronel Villarreal was killed in a clash with the Mexican Army. The power vacuum left by Coronel Villarreal's death prompted an internal war within the Milenio Cartel; on one front, Arzola Ortega, √ârick Valencia Salazar (alias \\"El 85\\"), and Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\") wanted to command the Milenio Cartel. The other front, which sided against Arzola Ortega and his accomplices, was headed by Elpidio Mojarro Ram√≠rez (alias \\"El Pilo\\") and V√≠ctor Manuel Torres Garc√≠a (alias \\"El Papirr√≠n\\"). Arzola Ortega and his faction eventually founded in the 2010s a new criminal group, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), while the other group of Milenio defectors founded another group, La Resistencia. According to Mexico's Secretariat of Public Security (SSP), Arzola Ortega was the CJNG's assassins' chief in the Jalisco municipalities of Guadalajara, Zapopan, Tonal√°, Tlaquepaque, and Tlajomulco de Z√∫√±iga. His role was to lead CJNG assassins against La Resistencia. Authorities believed he was involved in multiple murders across the Guadalajara metropolitan area; these murder investigations accused him of being both perpetrator and mastermind. In addition, he had a network of contacts within Jalisco's police forces that kept him informed of drug sales in local stores. The SSP accused him of being responsible for managing the CJNG's drug distribution in Guadalajara and its extended area. He also used the police force to grant protection to the operations of the CJNG. The SSP stated that he reported directly to El Mencho, the suspected top leader of the CJNG. To operate without being detected by his rivals, he used the alias Ram√≥n Franco Zavala. Arrest and imprisonment On 13 July 2011, the Mexican Federal Police (PF) arrested Arzola Ortega in Tlajomulco de Z√∫√±iga following a large operative conducted by the PF in the Guadalajara metropolitan area that was launched to apprehend him. At the crime scene, authorities found a .38 Super handgun, an Uzi 9 mm, radio communication equipment, and several unspecified documents. Arzola Ortega was arrested alongside an accomplice, Erick Jos√© Alc√°zar Lim√≥n (alias \\"El Ni√±o\\"), who was responsible for transporting money derived from illegal activities, and identifying members and safe houses owned by La Resistencia to Arzola Ortega. Once in custody, Arzola Ortega was handed over to the Subprocuradur√≠a de Investigaci√≥n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's former organized crime investigatory agency, to determine his legal status. The SIEDO confirmed that Arzola Ortega and Alc√°zar Lim√≥n had active arrest warrants that were issued on 25 August 2011. On 19 July 2011, a federal judge granted Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) a 40-day preventative arrest against Arzola Ortega for organized crime and illegal possession of firearm charges. He was kept under the PGR's custody during that time. This measure also extended to his collaborator Alc√°zar Lim√≥n. Once the preventative arrest concluded, a federal judge ordered both men to be transferred to prison on 5 September 2011. The judge confirmed that a trial against them would begin after the transfer concluded. Arzola Ortega was sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico. Alc√°zar Lim√≥n was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 5 (also known as \\"Oriente\\"), a maximum-security prison in Villa Aldama, Veracruz. On 28 March 2018, several inmates at Altiplano, including Arzola Ortega, protested to the Office of the Federal Prosecutor for the Consumer (PROFECO) for the price increase of potato chips, hygiene products, and paper in the prison's store. In the complaint, the inmates stated that since October 2017, a Cheetos bag of used to cost MXN$42 (US$2.2) and increased to MXN$60.50 (US$3.2); the price of a Doritos bag went from MXN$48 (US$2.55) to MXN$62 (US$3.3). The inmates and their families also complained that prisoners had no other option but to buy the junk food offered at the prison's store because of food shortage and poor diet options offered by the prison. They said it was unfair that the prison was \\"monopolizing\\" the prices and selling them goods at whatever price they wanted.  Conviction and release  On 9 December 2015, Arzola Ortega was sentenced to 24 years in prison by a federal court based in Toluca, State of Mexico. His charges were organized crime involvement, drug trafficking, and for being in possession of military-exclusive weapons. The accomplice who was arrested with him, Alc√°zar Lim√≥n, had the same charges and received a 13-year conviction. In addition, Arzola Ortega received a minimum wage sentence of 600 days, meaning that he would have to pay MXN$34,878 (US$2,055) in fines. Alc√°zar Lim√≥n received a 300-day minimum wage sentence, which equaled to MXN$17,439.00 (US$1,028) in fines. The court confirmed that when Arzola Ortega was arrested, his defense team issued multiple case revision requests and writs of amparo. Several courts received the requests made by his defense, but none of them were granted in his favor. With this result, the court in Toluca decided to render a solution and issued the sentence. In 2017, the PGR began a legal process to seize properties owned by Arzola Ortega, Alc√°zar Lim√≥n, and other suspected CJNG members and strawpersons. According to court files, Arzola Ortega and Alc√°zar Lim√≥n owned two properties in Guadalajara that authorities suspected were acquired from drug proceeds. The first one was in Cruz del Sur neighborhood, and was valued at MXN$1.78 million property; the second property was in Vicente Guerrero neighborhood and was valued at MXN$876,250. The other suspected CJNG members that the PGR tried to seize properties from were Jos√© Serna Padilla (alias \\"El Zopilote\\"), Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez L√≥pez (alias \\"El Antiguo\\"), Jos√© Bernab√© Brizuela Meraz (alias \\"La Vaca\\"), Lorena S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez, C√©sar Cazar√≠n Molina (alias \\"El Comandante Tornado\\"), and Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez (alias \\"El Menchito\\"). In September 2018, Arzola Ortega was released from prison. The reasons for his release were not publicly known at the time, but federal authorities confirmed after his death that Arzola Ortega's defense team appealed the sentence when it was officiated. In 2016, a court ordered the case to be revisited. An appeals court magistrate rejected the judge's verdict in 2018 after considering that the PGR did not have sufficient evidence against Arzola Ortega, thus reverting the 24-year sentence. The only criminal charge Arzola Ortega kept was illegal possession of firearms, which was a four-year conviction. Since he had already been in prison for more than four years, he was released.  Death  At 16:20 hours on 31 July 2019, Arzola Ortega was killed by gunmen inside a Carl's Jr. restaurant in the Plaza Galer√≠as mall in Zapopan. According to police reports, two assailants went inside the restaurant to kill Arzola Ortega, who was eating with his aunt and nephew. After killing him, one of the gunmen began shooting at the rest of the people inside the restaurant. The customers took cover under the tables while the gunmen shot at them. Several people were wounded in the attack. Mar√≠a Luisa Aguirre Sol√≠s, the wife of Governor of Nayarit Antonio Echevarr√≠a Garc√≠a, was coincidentally eating with her two children in the same restaurant. When the shootout began, her bodyguards responded to the attack and killed one of the assailants. Jalisco authorities stated that the bodyguards killed the assailants to protect the lives of the people inside the restaurant. The following morning, a lady who identified as Arzola Ortega's wife reclaimed the body at the Forensic Medical Services (SEMEFO). She confirmed that Arzola Ortega was 42 years old. The other person who was killed at the scene remained unidentified; he was not carrying any identification and no family members came forward to claim his corpse. Jalisco's security coordinator Macedonio Salom√≥n T√°mez Guajardo told the press that law enforcement officers were on alert for any possible violent reactions from organized crime groups.

Michell in his frequently referenced 1904 paper.Michell, A. G. M. (1904) The limits of economy of material in frame-structures, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 8(47), p. 589-597. Michell states that ‚Äúa frame (today called truss) (is optimal) attains the limit of economy of material possible in any frame-structure under the same applied forces, if the space occupied by it can be subjected to an appropriate small deformation, such that the strains in all the bars of the frame are increased by equal fractions of their lengths, not less than the fractional change of length of any element of the space.‚Äù The above conclusion is based on the Maxwell load-path theorem: sum_{} l_p f_p - sum_{} l_q f_q = C Where f_p is the tension value in any tension element of length l_p, f_q is the compression value in any compression element of length l_q and C is a constant value which is based on external loads applied to the structure. Based on the Maxwell load-path theorem, reducing load path of tension members textstyle sum_{} l_p f_p will reduce by the same value the load path of compression elementstextstyle sum_{} l_q f_q for a given set of external loads. Structure with minimum load path is one having minimum compliance (having minimum weighted deflection in the points of applied loads weighted by the values of these loads). In consequence Michell structures are minimum compliance trusses. Special cases 1. All bars of a truss are subject to a load of the same sign (tension or compression). Required volume of material is the same for all possible cases for a given set of loads. Michell defines minimum required volume of material to be: V_m=frac{sum_{} l f}{P} Where P is the allowable stress in the material. 2. Mixed tension and compression bars More general case are frames which consist of bars that both before and after the appropriate deformation, form curves of orthogonal systems. A two-dimensional orthogonal system remains orthogonal after stretching one series of curves and compressing the other with equal strain if and only if the inclination between any two adjacent curves of the same series is constant throughout their length. This requirement results with the perpendicular series of cures to be either: a) systems of tangents and involutes or b) systems of intersecting logarithmic spirals. Note that straight line or a circle are special cases of a logarithmic spiral. Examples Michell provided several examples of optimum frames: { style=\\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" ! style=\\"width: 120px;\\"  a ! style=\\"width: 120px;\\"  b ! style=\\"width: 120px;\\"  c ! style=\\"width: 120px;\\"  d ! style=\\"width: 120px;\\"  e - style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  A single force F applied at A, and acting at right angle to the line AB  A single force F applied at C centered between supports at points A and B (full space solution)  A single force F applied at C centered between supports at points A and B (half space solution)  Centrally-loaded beam with force away from the straight line between supports AB.

Nearly optimal design of trusses, Computers & Structures, , Vol: 8, Issue: 3, Page: 451-454, 1978 In spite of Michell trusses being defined for continuum (infinite number of members) these are sometimes called Michell trusses as well. Significant contribution to the topic of discrete optimum trusses had William Prager who used the method of the circle of relative displacements to arrive with optimal topology of such trusses (typically cantilevers). To recognize Prager's contribution discrete Michell trusses are sometimes called Prager trusses. Later geometry of cantilevered Prager trusses has been formalized by Mazurek, Baker and Tort Mazurek, A., Baker W.F. & Tort, C., Geometrical aspects of optimum truss like structures, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2011) 43: 231. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-010-0559-xMazurek, A., Geometrical aspects of optimum truss like structures for three-force problem, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2012) 45: 21. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-011-0679-y who noticed certain geometrical relationships between members of optimal discrete trusses for 3 point or 3 force problems.

It is one of the six cities (along with Lepreum, Macistus, Pyrgus, Epium, and Nudium) founded by the Minyans in the territory of the Paroreatae and Caucones. Its name was derived from Phaestus. Phrixa is rarely mentioned in history; but it shared the fate of the other Triphylian cities. It is cited by Xenophon in the war between Elis and Sparta and its allies led by Agis II about the year 400 BCE. After the end of the hostilities, Elis was forced to lose control of, among others, the city of Phrixa. It is also mentioned by Polybius; in the year 218 BCE, Philip V of Macedon took several cities of Elis among which was Phrixa. Its position is determined by Pausanias, who says that it was situated upon a pointed hill, opposite the Leucanias, a tributary of the Alpheius, and at a ford of the latter river. This pointed hill is now called Paleof√°naro, and is a conspicuous object from both sides of the river, whence the city received the name of Phaestus or Phaistos (Œ¶Œ±ŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ) in later times.

He committed 6 murders on sexual grounds between 2002 and 2003. The Chelyabinsk Regional Court found Yaikov guilty and sentenced him to compulsory treatment.  Biography  Yaikov was born in Kyrgyzstan, and was diagnosed with an intellectual disability in his childhood. In 2002, he got involved in drug smuggling, but, as he was mentally ill, he was released from criminal liability with a referral to compulsory treatment. After his discharge, he settled himself as a laborer. In October 2002, near a gas station, he committed his first murder; he killed a woman by strangulation. On May 1, 2003, in a garage cooperative, he killed another girl, with another murder following only three weeks later. Forensic examination revealed that all three victims at the time had been in a state of intoxication. Later it turned out that one of the victims had agreed to drink alcohol with the killer. Yaikov knocked out his victims with blows to the face, then dragged the women into the bushes where he raped and strangled them to death. (Supposedly, he raped them after the murder.) On the night of May 25, on the territory of a kindergarten, he raped and killed two graduate schoolgirls. Subsequently, the killer said that he had wanted to get acquainted with the girls, but when they refused, he attacked them. Later it turned out that the locals heard screams at night, but did not call the police, assuming that the schoolchildren were just celebrating their graduation. After the murder of the schoolgirls in the city, people started worrying about the murders in their vicinity. On September 18, Yaikov killed another girl. Local residents, hearing the victim's cries, called the police. The same day, the killer was detained. He was hiding in a tree near the crime scene, where he was found by operatives. Yaikov immediately confessed to all the murders, detailing every crime. In addition, his involvement in past crimes was proven by examination results. However, his defence party demanded to exclude Yaikov's testimony from the case, insisting that they give him the insanity defence. = Trial = In July 2004, an expert opinion was given, according to which Yaikov \\"presents a special danger to society, and therefore requires compulsory treatment in a psychiatric hospital of a specialized type with intensive supervision.\\" In February 2005, the Chelyabinsk Regional Court decided to send Yaikov to compulsory treatment, followed by a psychiatric examination, which would determine if the defendant was sane at the time of the crimes. However, the Supreme Court's cassation instance overturned this decision. In the beginning of 2007, because of the prolonged investigation, the time expired for the criminal procedure legislation to keep the defendant in custody. Yaikov was released under a written undertaking not to leave the place. In the same year, as part of investigative measures, with the permission of the prosecutor's office, he was sent to the Serbsky Center in Moscow. The experts found that Yaikov \\"poses a special danger to society and needs compulsory treatment\\", but did not answer - was Yaikov insane at the time of the crimes or did his psychiatric disorder come later? In another year, Yaikov was undergoing treatment, before passing a second examination at the Serbsky Center. Experts came to the conclusion that at the time of the crimes, Yaikov was insane. On September 11, 2008, the Chelyabinsk Regional Court found Yaikov insane and sent him to compulsory treatment in a psychiatric hospital with intensive supervision.

Early life and high school career Upshaw is the son of Sabrina and Reggie Upshaw Sr., who played football at Middle Tennessee State University. The younger Reggie Upshaw attended the Baylor School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he was a multi- sport athlete, winning a state high jump championship and earning all-state honors in football and basketball as a junior. Playing wide receiver and tight end in football, Upshaw had scholarship offers from Vanderbilt, Middle Tennessee and Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette. However, he suffered a broken right foot at the end of his season and another fracture at the beginning of his basketball season, prompting him to focus on basketball in the future. As a senior, Upshaw averaged 22 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks per game on the basketball court. He was considered to be a three-star recruit and received attention from several Division I programs before committing to Middle Tennessee and coach Kermit Davis.

In the next round, the Blue Raiders fell to Butler 74‚Äì65. Upshaw was selected to play in the 2017 Reese's College All-Star Game. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2017 NBA draft, Upshaw signed a free agent deal with the Milwaukee Bucks and played for the team in the NBA Summer League. Instead of joining their training camp in the hopes of making the regular-season roster, he agreed to a ten-month deal with Tigers T√ºbingen of the German Basketball Bundesliga in mid-July. Regarding the Bucks, Upshaw said, \\"I didn't feel like the contract that I had with them would have been the best one for me my first year.\\" Upshaw averaged 14.4 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game as a rookie. ‚ÄúThe amount of work I‚Äôve put in during my first season and this summer have prepared me to take the next step in my career,‚Äù he said.

She was the first woman farmworker hired to be a union representative.  Early life  Moreno was born Maria Torres Martinez in Karnes City, Texas to migrant workers. Her father Vicente Martinez was an orphan of the Mexican Revolution. Her mother Leonarda Torres was Mescalero Apache. Maria married Luis Moreno at 15. They joined the Dustbowl Migration to California in 1940. Maria and Luis eventually had 12 children: Lillian, Abel, Elida, Elvira, Martha, Joe, Elizabeth, Tito, Yolanda, Eva, Olivia and Alex .  Career  Moreno's activism began in 1958, after a flood destroyed crops and stopped farm work. Farmworkers were denied food assistance and her family nearly starved. In 1959 she was hired as an organizer for the AWOC, becoming the first female farmworker in the U.S. to be hired as a union organizer. In December 1961, funding for the AWOC was suspended by the AFL-CIO. Moreno was elected to plead AWOC's case at the national AFL-CIO convention in Miami Beach, Florida. AWOC was such a small union that it granted only one official delegate, Maria Moreno. Her alternate delegate was Neil Scott, an Okie farmworker. Accompanied by fellow AWOC members Otto Johnson and Violet Rotan, they drove across country to attend the conference, where Maria's impassioned speech convinced the organization to restore the funding. This was an important moment in California Labor history, as the movement remained at least minimally active, with the Filipino chapters of AWOC led by Larry Itliong being the most militant. Although the 1965 grape strike is usually credited to Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta's NFWA (National Farm Workers Association), it was started by the Filipino AWOC members, who were later joined by the NFWA. The two groups merged in 1966, affiliating with the national AFL-CIO. > There would not have been the Chavez movement, at least in the form that it > eventually assumed, if it hadn't been for the survival of AWOC. Those of us > in the volunteer period kept it going. I think it would have disappeared > entirely from view if we hadn't been there and if we hadn't had that > Strathmore Conference, and if we hadn't sent back the 4 workers to Miami > Beach and all the rest of it. We made a difference. In spite of this success, Moreno's position was terminated by the new management of the AWOC and the family moved to the Arizona desert, where Maria began her work as a Pentecostal preacher. In 1965, the League of Mexican Women presented Maria Moreno with an Achievement Award at their annual awards banquet. Maria later moved to the Arizona-Mexico border and built a mission that ministered to the poor. She died of breast cancer in 1989.

He has produced nearly 2,000 hours of television programming, feature films and documentaries, and has been recognized with several Gemini Awards and an international Emmy Award nomination. Falzon is credited as a producer on thirty titles, including Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000), Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs (2005), Ghost Trackers (2005-2006), Artzooka (2010), Extreme Babysitting (2013-2014), Foreign Affairs (1992) and The Naked Entrepreneur (2016). He has presided over or co-chaired several international entertainment companies.  Biography  Falzon studied television in what was then known as the Radio and Television Arts program at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now known as the RTA School of Media). Following graduation, Falzon moved into the marketing department of CBC TV, which was \\"then a very small division in the corporation, selling about $500,000 a year of CBC programming.\\" Falzon \\"travelled the world selling CBC programs to other broadcasters,\\" and within five years annual sales topped $5 million. After leaving the CBC, Falzon founded Producers Group International in 1987 with fellow Ryerson graduate Gary Howsam.\\" PGI and Falzon's \\"salesmanship\\" were credited in a 1989 Toronto Star article for helping \\"many of Canada's film makers, from mega-buck productions at the CBC to small independents\\" get their \\"programs screened around the world\\" -- including a CTV drama series named Mount Royal and a \\"popular music program from CITY-TV\\" titled The New Music. With Falzon at the helm, Catalyst Entertainment produced Foreign Affairs, Canada's \\"first daily, afternoon soap opera\\", which was set and shot in Argentina and was created, produced, written and performed \\"mainly by Canadians.\\" The series was pre-sold to Germany, Spain, Italy, Britain, South America and the United States The commercial success of the show was premised on the idea that \\"an internationally based soap opera would bypass the usual handicaps of Canadian TV\\". In 2000, Falzon teamed Catalyst Entertainment up with Britain's Britt Allcroft to make the first feature film involving Thomas the Tank Engine, titled Thomas and the Magic Railroad. Featuring Alec Baldwin, Peter Fonda and Mara Wilson, the film was animated and produced by Catalyst Entertainment, which at the time also produced Shining Time Station, \\"the half-hour program that introduced Thomas to U.S. audiences.\\" The movie, which cost US$20 million to produce, combined live action and animation. On the success of the Thomas brand, Falzon remarked that \\"the simplicity and the safeness of Thomas is what makes him so successful,\\" adding that it's \\"not about being high-tech\\"; rather, it's \\"really still about storytelling and characters that [children] can trust and feel good with.\\" By 2001, Falzon was serving as President of Gullane Entertainment (formerly the Britt Alcroft Company), with operations in London, New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and Tokyo. That year, Falzon announced two significant acquisitions of entertainment properties by Gullane: Fireman Sam , and Guinness World Records for a reported $65 million. Falzon became co-chairman of CCI in 2002, which grew out of the merger in 2002 of Arnie Zipursky's Cambium Entertainment and Catalyst Entertainment, which was led by Falzon. A \\"Canadian cartoon producer\\", CCI was \\"best known for properties like Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs, Erky Perky, and Shining Time Station.\\" = Academic Life = In 2010, Falzon was appointed an associate professor and assumed the role of chair of the RTA School of Media. As chair of the RTA School of Media, Falzon was \\"one of the architects\\" of a new BA in Sport Media, housed in the old Maple Leaf Gardens, known today as the Mattamy Athletic Centre. Focusing on sports entertainment, business, marketing and media, the program was noted as the first of its kind in Canada. In 2015, Falzon was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Communication and Design at Ryerson University for a five-year term effective July 1. In the appointment notice, Falzon was credited with renewing the reputation of the RTA School of Media, refreshing the curriculum across its three undergraduate programs, establishing the Transmedia Zone and RTA Productions, launching a collaborative summer program called \\"RTA in LA\\", and teaching for more than 20 years. Falzon was promoted to full Professor of Media Production in 2018. Falzon holds a master's in theology from the University of Toronto and a master's in spirituality from Regis College.

Life Cauchie was born in Haulchin, Hainaut, on 26 October 1860, and was educated at the minor seminary of Bonne-Esp√©rance in Estinnes. In 1882 he entered the major seminary, receiving priestly ordination from Isidore-Joseph du Rousseaux, bishop of Tournai, on 25 October 1885. After ordination he was sent to the Catholic University of Leuven to pursue studies in History, graduating licentiate in 1888. His bishop then sent him to Rome in 1888-1889, where he worked in the Vatican Secret Archives, which had been opened to researchers by Pope Leo XIII in 1879. He took a particular interest in documents relating to Belgian history.Jacques Lavalleye, \\"Cauchie, Alfred\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 38 (Brussels, 1973), 67‚Äî78. In 1890 Cauchie submitted a doctoral thesis on La querelle des investitures dans les dioc√®ses de Li√®ge et de Cambrai (the investiture controversy in the dioceses of Li√®ge and Cambrai), which was printed in two volumes by Peeters. Charles Moeller then took him on as his teaching assistant for the seminars in historical method at the Faculty of Arts, and in 1892 D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier invited him to teach a course on heuristics and historical criticism at the recently founded Institute of Philosophy. The following year he was appointed to lecture on medieval institutions in the Faculty of Arts, and in 1895 he replaced the deceased Canon Bernard Jungmann, teaching Church History in the Faculties of Theology and Canon Law. In 1900 he founded the Revue d'Histoire Eccl√©siastique, a leading journal in the field of ecclesiastical history. In 1892 he published a report to the Ministry of Education calling for systematic searches of Italian archives for documents relating to Belgian history.\\"Mission aux Archives vaticanes.

This was the first step towards the founding of the Belgian Historical Institute in Rome a decade later. To Cauchie's chagrin, the first director to be appointed was Ursmer Berli√®re rather than himself. It was only in 1919 that Cauchie fulfilled his ambition of being appointed director, the same year that he was elected to the Acad√©mie royale de Belgique. He took up the post the following year, and died in Rome on 10 February 1922. Works Due to a heavy load of teaching and administration, Cauchie published relatively little beyond short articles about archival finds and teaching methods. His work was also impeded by the destruction of Leuven University Library in the German invasion of 1914 (during which he was himself briefly a displaced person). Together with Ren√© Maere he edited Recueil des instructions g√©n√©rales aux nonces de Flandre (1596-1635) (Brussels, 1904); he also contributed entries to the Biographie Nationale de Belgique on Poppo of Stavelot (in volume 18), Richard of Saint-Vanne (vol. 19) and Rupert of Deutz (vol. 20).

It addresses the questions of how socially constructed variation in the sound system is used and learned. The term was first used by Denise Deshaies-Lafontaine in their 1974 dissertation on Quebecois French, with early work in the field focusing on answering questions, chiefly sociolinguistic, using phonetic methods and data. The field began to expand rapidly in the 1990s: interest in the field increased and the boundaries of the field expanded to include a wider diversity of topics. Currently, sociophonetic studies often employ methods and insight from a wide range of fields including psycholinguistics, clinical linguistics, and computational linguistics.  Development  At the intersection between phonetics and sociolinguistics, sociophonetics shares its history with both fields starting with PƒÅ·πáini's phonetic analysis of Sanskrit circa 600 BCE. PƒÅnini's grammar investigated differences between standard (Vedic) usage and the regional varieties of Sanskrit spoken outside of ritual contexts, with some grammatical rules taking into account sociolinguistic context. After PƒÅnini few phonetic studies were conducted until the 1800s when technological advances especially in audio recording became available. As modern linguistics developed, the types of information investigated tended to be split into an abstract linguistic system and the context in which it is used. The context of use introduces a wide range of variability due to individual variation such as physiological and anatomical differences, but has also been shown to include social and indexical information about the speaker and context. The field of sociophonetics, and sociolinguistics generally, began in the 1960s and 70s with the work of William Labov who found statistical correlations between the use of certain pronunciations and membership in social categories. These early investigations tended to focus on variation and change in vowels, and they were conducted almost exclusively in the United States on American English.  Topics investigated  Sociophonetics covers a broad range of topics between the quintessential fields phonetics and sociolinguistics. Studies have focused on differences in speech production, the social meaning of particular pronunciations, perception and perceivability of sociophonetic patterns, and the role of sociocultural factors in phonetic models of production among other topics. Of particular interest to sociophoneticians is the sources and causes of variation in speech, with many studies focusing on differences in pronunciation between regions, social classes, races and ethnicities, genders, sexes, sexual orientations, ages, and within speakers. A common thread between these investigations is the role of biology as an influential but not deterministic force in phonetic variation. For example, young boys will often lower their voices before any pubescent, physical changes occur in their vocal tract in order to distinguish themselves from girls and establish themselves as \\"masculine\\".

Graham's record attempt is being covered by Dotwatcher.cc.DotWatcher.cc After 23 days, Graham crossed into Russia, and had covered 5,126 miles when crossing into Khongor in Mongolia. At the halfway stage, Graham was in Australia. In late August or early September 2018, Graham reached the Yukon Territory from Alaska, having cycled 12,000 miles of the total journey. A local shopkeeper advised Graham to acquire a firearm to protect herself from hungry bears who were down from the hills for the salmon in the river. Graham's custom-built bike was donated by the manufacturer Shand Cycles in Livingston, West Lothian. It has a steel frame to absorb shock on the variety of road surfaces along the route. Steven Shand has previously worked with Olympic medalist Sir Chris Hoy to design a keirin bike. Graham's record attempt is also supported by London-based bikepacking bag manufacturer, Apidura, many local people and businesses in the Inverness community, and by the leading US cloud solutions company, Unitas Global Inc.

Design The mle 1887/1893 guns were typical built-up guns of the period with several layers of steel reinforcing hoops. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The two designs were similar in construction and performance, the main difference between the two models being their weight 37.6 tonnes for the 1887 and 35.4 tonnes for the 1893. The later Canon de 274 mod√®le 1893/1896, despite being shorter, used a larger propellant charge which gave them higher muzzle velocity and range. Naval Use Mle 1887/1893 guns armed pre-dreadnought battleships and ironclads of the French Navy built or refit between 1887-1902. Pre-dreadnought Battleships * Charles Martel - The secondary armament of this ship consisted of two mle 1887s mounted in single gun turrets on lateral sponsons amidships. * Carnot - The secondary armament of this ship consisted of two mle 1887s mounted in single gun turrets on lateral sponsons amidships. * Jaur√©guiberry - The secondary armament of this ship consisted of two mle 1887s mounted in single gun turrets on lateral sponsons amidships. * Mass√©na - The secondary armament of this ship consisted of two mle 1893s mounted in single gun turrets on lateral sponsons amidships. * Bouvet - The secondary armament of this ship consisted of two mle 1893s mounted in single gun turrets on lateral sponsons amidships.

She was the first woman professor from the old Sokoto caliphate states (comprising present-day Sokoto State, Zamfara State and Kebbi State), an Islamic dominated region in Northern Nigeria. In 1999, she was made commissioner for women affairs and social development by Attahiru Bafarawa-led administration. Madawaki is also an advocate for the representation of Nigerian women in politics.  Early life and education  Born in Gusau, Madawaki had her primary education in Sarkin Kudu Primary School. She proceeded to Government Girls Secondary School, Kotarkoshi for her secondary school. She obtained her NCE from College of Education, Sokoto (renamed Shehu Shagari College of Education). After her program in the school, she began lecturing educational psychology at the institution. She got her master's degree from Usmanu Danfodio University, then her doctorate from Bayero University. Madawaki is the first female professor in old Sokoto State, comprising three states in present-day Nigeria.  Political career  Madawaki was made commissioner for women affairs and social development to the government of Attahiru Bafarawa between 1999‚Äì03. Other roles she played in statewide capacities includes - chairperson, Teachers Service board (2004‚Äì07). In federal capacity, she was appointed member, Presidential Technical Committee on Housing and Urban Development between 2002 and 2004; member, Presidential Technical Board Federal Mortgage Bank, Abuja (2004‚Äì07), and member, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, Abuja (2008-2012). In 2014, she was selected as a delegate representing Sokoto State in the sovereign national conference, an initiative of President Goodluck Jonathan on finding lasting solutions to issues that arises in the co-habitation of Nigerians. In 2017, she organized a peaceful protest in Sokoto State that called for a woman president in Nigeria and pushed for more representation of women within the state. This caused government officials in the state to reiterate their commitment towards gender equity in the state. In January 2018, she was made commissioner for basic and secondary education for Sokoto State by Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. In April 2018, along with the 24 other commissioners in the state, she was sacked by the government in what was termed by her employers as \\"restructuring and re-strategising the cabinet for optimum efficiency and service delivery to the people of State\\". Speaking on underage marriage among Northern women, Madawaki explained that she is more concerned about the orientation of the family of the girls as she was also married quite early but her parents knew the value of education and it didn't deter her from furthering it. In an interview with Blueprint.ng, Madawaki commented that marginalization of women in any form should be eradicated from the human space. She furthered that even though the dictates of ones religion supersedes gender unification, women should not be situated as being below men, as if given equal opportunities in certain aspects of life, they may even perform better than the male counterparts. She decried tribalism and favoritism in the Nigerian political and societal space as also being responsible for gender segmentation in Nigeria. Madawaki is a recipient of national honours, MFR and Order of the Federal Republic.

Writing in the 18th century, the English statesman Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield reported that he knew \\"a gentleman who was so good a manager of his time that he would not even lose that small portion of it which the call of nature obliged him to pass in the necessary-house; but gradually went through all the Latin poets, in those moments. The advent of the mobile phone is believed to have significantly increased bathroom reading. A 2009 study conducted in Israel found that a majority of adults read from their cell phones on the toilet, and a 2015 study conducted by Verizon found that 90% of cell phone users admitted to reading from their phones while on the toilet. Bathroom reading and literature The term \\"bathroom reading\\" refers to any literary material deemed suitable for casual or light reading. In 2011, the Canadian author Margaret Atwood wrote: Pulp magazines were associated with bathroom reading, which the film Pulp Fiction references in repeated scenes of John Travolta's character Vincent Vega reading the pulpy spy novel Modesty Blaise while sat on a toilet. Bathroom reading also refers to a genre of books containing humor and trivia, such as the Uncle John's Bathroom Reader series. In James Joyce's novel Ulysses, the protagonist Leopold Bloom reads a magazine on the toilet and then wipes himself with it. Sanitation, hygiene and health According to a professor at the Columbia University Medical Center, reading in the bathroom can potentially facilitate the spread of disease if airborne bacteria land on reading material and are transmitted to the reader; however, the activity is not a significant health concern as long as the reading environment is sanitary, the reader does not have a compromised immune system, and the reader practices ordinary hygiene. A University of Arizona microbiologist who researched the topic in 2002 found that bathroom reading at the workplace was not a significant hygiene risk, noting that paper is a relatively unattractive environment for bacteria and that desk areas often have more bacteria than bathrooms because they are cleaned less frequently. Although time spent on the toilet can increase the incidence of hemorrhoids, a 2009 study found that bathroom readers were not more likely than non-bathroom readers to have hemorrhoids. Bathroom reading and psychology Even when people read for extended periods of time during defecation, it is rare for bathroom readers to feel disgusted by the smell of their own feces, or even to consciously notice the smell. Sigmund Freud also noted this phenomenon in Civilization and Its Discontents, though he described lack of awareness of fecal smell in general, not just while reading: \\"in spite of all man's developmental advances, he scarcely finds the smell of his own excreta repulsive, but only that of other people's.\\" The psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel believed bathroom reading was an indication of early childhood trauma. He wrote that the activity is \\"an attempt to preserve the equilibrium of the ego; part of one's bodily substance is being lost and so fresh matter must be absorbed through the eyes.\\" James Strachey, who translated Freud's works into English, similarly noted that the activity of casual reading while defecating was essentially \\"infantile\\" behavior. DiMassimo Brand Advertising once tested political advertising in bathrooms by placing various messages about George W. Bush and Al Gore in New York City public restrooms. The company's study found that 62 percent of people \\"remembered the exact message\\" of bathroom ads, compared to 16 percent for billboard advertisements.

Biography  Carey Clarke was born in Donegal in 1936 as the only child of Protestant, middle- class parents. He was educated at St Andrew's College in Dublin, and from 1954 to 1959 attended The National College of Art there, with further studies at the Salzburg Summer school of Fine Art under Emilio Vedova (1969), with Annigoni in Florence (1976‚Äì77) and at Slade School in London (1991). He taught at the National College of Art and Design from 1959 to 1995, where his emphasis on painterly craft and observation had a profound influence on several generations of younger painters. Clarke was appointed to a full-time teaching position in 1968, and to the college's first Academic Council in 1969, in the midst of a student rebellion demanding more freedom for self- expression and a relaxation of academic discipline. Perceived as a conservative, he became a target for hostility by avant-garde elements within the college, who (according to Clarke) made it difficult for him to teach there. Artist Robert Armstrong (who came to NCAD as a student in 1969 and subsequently taught at the college) has described how students \\"were almost forced\\" to take sides: > \\"There were certain staff members, like Alice Hanratty and Charlie Cullen > who represented the avant garde, and there were the John Kellys and Carey > [Clarke] and Brett McEntagart, who were associated with the RHA, who were > regarded as the enemy ... it became very bitter, very unpleasant. There were > a lot of casualties along the way.\\" Despite these difficulties, Clarke continued to teach at NCAD, upholding a traditional approach to observational drawing and painting where possible, and remained long enough to influence younger artists (among them Mick O'Dea, Joe Dunne, Maeve McCarthy, James Hanley, Geraldine O'Neill and Conor Walton) less hostile to academic tradition. According to Shirley Armstrong Duffy \\"Clarke has been a vital link between academic tradition and its current exploitation and reinterpretation\\" by younger artists. An associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy from 1967, Clarke was elected full member in 1981 and served as President of that institution from 1992 - 1996. He is also a member of the Watercolour Society of Ireland and the Cork Arts Society Principally a painter of landscapes, interiors and still lifes, Carey Clarke is also regarded as one of Ireland's finest portraitists and has painted many leading politicians, academics, artists and other well-known Irish figures, among them former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, former Lord Mayor of Dublin Michael Mulcahy, playwright Tom Murphy and artist Mick O'Dea. Clarke remains active as a painter, with an exhibition of recent portraits at the RHA in 2017 marking his eightieth year.  Technique and aesthetic  Whether working in oil paint, tempera, watercolour or graphite, Carey Clarke's work is always slowly and patiently constructed, his technique highly controlled and meticulous, aiming at realism and classical balance. According to James Hanley \\"His work is all about the perception and analysis of reality, and the ability to then translate that experience into the exquisite language of paint.\\" Aidan Dunne has written that \\"even when he is depicting southern locations bathed in warm Mediterranean light, Clarke‚Äôs yen for absolute control and endlessly refined detail lends a certain chilly quality to the genuine appeal of his work.\\" According to Clarke himself, \\"My work is clearly realistic. Nevertheless I sometimes transcend this obsessiveness with realism and create the occasional image that is imbued with lyrical feeling.\\"  Critical appreciation  Irish Times critic Aidan Dunne has describes Clarke as \\"one of the most popular and respected of Ireland's established academic artists, and deservedly so.\\" Brian Sewell described him as \\"among [the] keepers of the academic faith.\\" Bruce Arnold declared him \\"a master of his craft and art, revered as a teacher, admired as a painter and loved as a friend.\\" According to Crist√≠n Leach Hughes, > \\"Contemporary reaction to Clarke‚Äôs work may hinge on questions of taste and > fashion, but realism is enjoying a revival among younger, more conceptual > painters than Clarke. The fact that he is still painting and passing his > skills on to the next generation means the Irish art world continues to be > that bit richer.\\" James Hanley has written of Clarke's \\"remarkable body of work that is of the best of the European classical tradition, in portraiture, still life, landscape and interiors, and Irish in his commitment to the landscape of his native place ‚Äì making him the continuum, of Osborne, Orpen and Keating, Hennessy and McGonigal\\", and also of his \\"enormous contribution\\" as a teacher: \\" ... using a timeless language, relevant to any painter, of any time, he taught students to understand design, tone, pictorial harmonies, composition, structure, planes, figure to ground, taste and refinements of aesthetics in the execution of a style.\\" Mick O'Dea, former President of the Royal Hibernian Academy, offers this evaluation of Carey Clarke's work and his position in the history of Irish art: > \\"Carey Clarke follows his vision, and he will have a corpus of work that > will transcend any decade, particularly as part of the continuity of that > Orpen tradition, which was so derided even when I was at college ... I think > there is a line going back to Ingres, from Orpen to Keating to Clarke, and > on to the present generation such as myself. So there is a continuous line. > I think he was holding that line when it was being most assaulted, and it > was looking a hopeless cause.\\" Shirley Armstrong Duffy argues that \\"Carey Clarke has largely been ignored by art historians and critics alike, because of his reputation as an academic and a conservative at a time when traditions were being subverted\\" and that his achievement is ripe for reappraisal.

She was described as \\"outspoken advocate of women's rights.\\" Early life Gertrude Gaffney was born in Middletown, County Armagh, and attended the St Louis convent, Carrickmacross. Using the pen name \\"Conor Galway\\", she published a number of stories and one novel, Workers towards the dawn (1919). By 1920, Gaffney was living in London and was occasionally having articles published in the Irish Independent on political Irish demonstrations there. At the same time she was writing other Catholic publications, and was the Dublin correspondent of The Universe. From the late 1920s to the early 1930s, she was living in Dublin and working as the Independent's social correspondent. She left this position to return to London to become the editor of the London women's magazine Queen. Career in the Irish Independent Her close friend, Frank Geary, recruited her back to the Irish Independent in 1935 when he appointed her women's columnist. The regular column, I sketch your world, was a combination of social and fashion gossip with political analysis. Before the outbreak of World War I, she travelled widely in Europe reporting news stories. At this time it was unusual for Irish newspapers to have such roving foreign correspondents in favour of using agency staff. After visiting Eoin O'Duffy's training camp in Spain, her coverage on the Irish Brigade fighting for Franco in 1936 was uncritical. After the war she wrote about and publicised the problems many of the fighters had in returning Ireland, as well as the controversy over the funds raised on the behalf of the Brigade between O'Duffy and Patrick Belton. She covered wide ranged parts of Europe, and was in Danzig just before the outbreak of World War II, narrowly escaping before the fighting began. In 1933, she conducted lengthy interviews with fellow journalist, Francis McCullagh. Gaffney was a strong and outspoken opponent of the 1937 Irish constitution, as she believed the articles relating to the role of women was inspired by Hitler, claiming that √âamon de Valera held similar dictatorial ambitions and stating that he \\"has always been a reactionary where women are concerned. He dislikes and distrusts us as a sex.\\" She laid out at the constitution did not acknowledge the economic need for women to work, would lead to women being forced out of the workforce, and could even question female suffrage. Her coverage in the Irish Independent on the topic is seen to have rallied female voters against the constitution. In 1937, Gaffney wrote a series of articles on the Irish female experience of emigration to Britain which was so popular they were reprinted as a pamphlet: Emigration to England: what you should know about it: advice to Irish girls (1937). In particular the columns denounced the practice of Irish parents and priests sending unmarried pregnant women to Britain, deeming it \\"unchristian\\", and highlighted to issues girls and women from rural backgrounds faced in Britain. She suggested that this emigration was due to the damage agriculture was suffering in Ireland due to de Valera's economic war, as well as Irish women's naive inability to appreciate rural Ireland. However, Gaffney was also an admirer of Father Peter Conefrey, who advocated a pastoral and simple rural lifestyle that would reject foreign culture for Irish forms. When discussing the issues that Irish servants in Jewish households in the East End of London, an antisemitic undertone emerged. Gaffney was ardently anti-Zionist, and in several articles from the 1930s she made direct comparisons between Palestinian Arabs and those Irish who fought the British in the Irish War of Independence, drawing a parallel between Amin al-Husseini and Michael Collins. After World War II, Gaffney was confined to Ireland, and as a consequence didn't recover her former prominence as a journalist. She had hoped to write a history of Fine Gael, that would be a foil to The Irish Republic by Dorothy Macardle. The University College Dublin Fine Gael archives hold correspondence from Gaffney on this unfulfilled project. Later life Her regular Irish Independent column ceased in 1946, possibly due to ill health. However, the occasional article from Gaffney appeared as late as 1957. She died on the 8 or 9 December 1959 in a Dublin nursing home, and was buried in the family plot in Middletown, County Armagh. While Gaffney never married, there has been much speculation about her relationship with her editor, Frank Geary.

The new regiment formed part of 45 AA Brigade in 5 AA Division. In November 1940, however, 5 AA Division was split, and a new 9 AA Division took over South Wales. 45 AA Brigade was also split, and in February 1941 the regiment came under the newly-formed 61 AA Bde in Swansea.Farndale, Annexes D & H.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. At this period searchlights were deployed in clusters of three lights in an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Royal Air Force (RAF) night-fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 393. There was enemy air activity over the Bristol Channel and South Wales coast on most nights during the winter of 1940‚Äì41, but usually these were reconnaissances or nuisance raids.

It was created as part of research by the pair into computer science and machine learning. Turochamp is capable of playing an entire chess game against a human player at a low level of play by calculating all potential moves and all of the potential player moves in response, assigning point values to each game state, and selecting the move with the highest average possible point value. Turochamp is the earliest known computer game to enter development, but was never completed by Turing and Champernowne, as its algorithm was too complex to be run by the early computers of the time such as the Automatic Computing Engine. Turing attempted to convert the program into executable code for the 1951 Ferranti Mark 1 computer in Manchester, but was unable to do so. Turing played a match against computer scientist Alick Glennie using the program in the summer of 1952, executing it manually step by step, but by his death in 1954 had still been unable to run the program on an actual computer. Champernowne did not continue the project, and the original program design was not preserved. Despite never being run on a computer, the program is a candidate for the first chess program; several other chess programs were designed or proposed around the same time, including another one which Turing unsuccessfully tried to run on the Ferranti Mark 1. The first successful program in 1951, also developed for the Mark 1, was directly inspired by Turochamp, and was capable only of solving \\"mate-in-two\\" problems. A recreation of Turochamp was constructed in 2012 for the Alan Turing Centenary Conference. This version was used in a match with chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, who gave a keynote at the conference. Gameplay Turochamp simulates a game of chess against the player by accepting the player's moves as input and outputting its move in response. The program's algorithm uses a two-move heuristic to determine the best move to make: it calculates all of the potential moves that it can make, then all of the potential player responses that could be made in turn, assigns a point value to each resulting state, then makes the move with the highest average resulting points. Points are determined based on several criteria, such as the mobility of each piece, the safety of each piece, the threat of checkmate, the value of the player's piece if taken, and several other factors. Different moves are given different point values; for example taking the queen is given 10 points but a pawn only one point, and placing the king in check is given a point or half of a point based on the layout of the board. According to Champernowne, the algorithm is primarily designed around the decision to take a piece or not; according to Turing, the resulting gameplay produces a low level game of chess, which he considered commensurate with his self-described average skill level at the game. History Alan Turing at age 16 Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Beginning in 1941, while working in wartime cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park, Turing began to discuss with his colleagues the possibility of a machine being able to play chess or perform other \\"intelligent\\" tasks, as well as the idea of a computer solving a problem by searching through all possible solutions using a heuristic or algorithm. Some of Turing's cryptanalysis work, such as on the Bombe, was done through this model of a computing machine searching through possibilities for a solution. He continued to discuss the idea with his colleagues throughout the war, such as with economic statistician D. G. Champernowne in 1944, and by 1945 he was convinced that a machine capable of performing general computations would be theoretically capable of replicating anything a human brain could do, including playing chess. After World War II, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1946, Turing wrote a report for the NPL entitled \\"Proposed Electronic Calculator\\" that described several projects that he planned to use the ACE for; one of these was a program to play chess. He gave a reading at the London Mathematical Society the following year in which he presented the idea that a machine programmed to play chess could learn on its own and acquire its own experience. Subsequently, in 1948, he wrote a new report for the NPL, entitled \\"Intelligent Machinery\\", which suggested a form of imitation chess. In the late summer of 1948 Turing and Champernowne, then his colleague at King's College, Cambridge, devised a system of theoretical rules to determine the next strokes of a chess game. They designed a program that would enact an algorithm that would follow these rules, though the program was too complex to able to be run on the ACE or any other computer of the time. The program was named Turochamp, a combination of their surnames. It is sometimes misreported as \\"Turbochamp\\". According to Champernowne, his wife played a simulated game against the program, nicknamed the \\"paper machine\\", and lost. Turing attempted to convert the program into executable code for the 1951 Ferranti Mark 1 computer in Manchester, but was unable to do so due to the complexity of the code. According to Jack Copeland, author of several books on Turing, he was not concerned that the program could not be run, as he was convinced that the speed and sophistication of computers would soon rise to make it possible. In the summer of 1952, Turing played a match against computer scientist Alick Glennie using the program, executing it manually step by step. The match, which was recorded, had the Turochamp program losing to Glennie in 29 moves, with each of the program's moves taking up to 30 minutes to evaluate. Although the match demonstrated that the program could viably play against a human in a full game, it was not run on an actual computer before Turing's death in 1954. Legacy Garry Kasparov speaking at the Alan Turing Centenary Conference in Manchester on 25 June 2012. Turochamp is a candidate for the first chess program, though the original program was never run on a computer. Several other chess programs were designed and attempted around the same time, such as in Claude Shannon's 1950 article Programming a Computer for Playing Chess, Konrad Zuse's chess routines developed from 1941 to 1945 for his proposed programming language Plankalk√ºl, and Donald Michie and Shaun Wylie's chess program Machiavelli, which Turing unsuccessfully tried to run on the Ferranti Mark I at the same time as Turochamp. In November 1951 Dietrich Prinz, who worked at Ferranti and was inspired by Turing's work on Turochamp, developed the first runnable computer-based chess program for the Ferranti Mark I, which could solve \\"mate-in-two\\" problems. The original code and algorithm written by Turing and Champernowne has not been preserved. In 1980, Champernowne described the way Turochamp worked, but he was not able to recall all of the details of the game's rules. A version of Turochamp was developed in 2012 from descriptions of the game's algorithm as a symbolic recreation. After the initial recreation was unable to recreate Turing's simulated match against Glennie, several computer chess experts and contemporaries of Turing were consulted in interpreting Turing and Champernowne's descriptions of the program, including Ken Thompson, creator of the 1983 Belle chess machine and the Unix operating system. They were unable to find the explanation for the deviation until they consulted with Donald Michie, who suggested that Turing had not been concerned with meticulously working out exactly which move Turochamp would recommend. With this in mind they were able to prove that from the very first move of the game Turing had incorrectly deviated from moves that appeared suboptimal without working out their point value.

Multilingualism is considered the use of more than one language by an individual or community of speakers. Globalization is commonly defined as the international movement toward economic, trade, technological, and communications integration and concerns itself with interdependence and interconnectedness. As a result of the interconnectedness brought on by globalization, languages are being transferred between communities, cultures, and economies at an increasingly fast pace. Therefore, though globalization is widely seen as an economic process, it has resulted in linguistic shifts on a global scale, including the recategorization of privileged languages, the commodification of multilingualism, the Englishization of the globalized workplace, and varied experiences of multilingualism along gendered lines. Language Contact, Categories, and Powers Multilingualism is considered a form of language contact. This contact occurs when language communities, through obligation or choice, come in contact with one another. Multilingualism is therefore considered both a tool and a symptom of forces that necessitate or encourage contact between communities. Globalization is one of those forces. Researchers accept that there are multiple categories of language, even as they often disagree on the explicit number of those categories. De Swaan's analysis of the world language system, which is arguably the most common analysis, distinguishes between five different types of languages, one of which is \\"English as global lingua franca.\\" English is ‚Äúhypercentral‚Äù to globalization as a result of both its common international use and its ‚Äúhighly prized‚Äù nature. Because English serves as lingua franca in so many international contexts (tourism, business, academia, science, etc.), most linguists place it outside the categories of majority language or minority language even if, functionally, it could be either one. These language categories create hierarchies of power in a globalized system in which minority language speakers who also speak a majority language are afforded more access and privilege than those who only speak only a minority language. Outside of contexts in which English is a national (and thus majority) language, those who are multilingual in English and another language are offered even more access and privilege in global society. For that reason, South Korea and China have been made a tremendous investments on their English language education. It is reported by Statistics Korea and the Korean Ministry of Education that South Korea has invested more than 30% of the $15 billion private education cost in the English language training. Moreover, based on the Ambient Insight's report, there are more than 50,000 privately-operated English language institutes established in China. Furthermore, economically, being a bilingual who are able to use English and another language is worth generating no less than $128,000 during a 40-year period of economic activity. Multilingualism as Global Capital French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu views language, and more specifically multilingual skills, as a form of social and symbolic capital that follows speakers as they search for work and power both locally and transnationally. Bourdieu's views have been highly influential in study of language and power. He posits that by transforming social and symbolic capital into economic capital, the multilingual is at an advantage. In short, language is commodified for use in globalized society. As a result, multilinguals may have labor market advantages over monolinguals in their ability to work with global customers. Studies demonstrate that multilingualism is positively correlated with higher salaries and gross domestic production (GDP). One study out of Switzerland suggests that Switzerland's GDP is augmented by multilingualism by 10%. According to the study by Wharton and LECG Europe, acquiring another language has the effect of increasing one's annual salary by approximately 2%. In addition, American military personnel could potentially make up to $1,000 per month if they have a good command of foreign languages, according to Money magazine. Furthermore, recent researches have demonstrated that the brains of people who can speak a variety of languages are superior than those of people who speak only one language and have a significantly lower risk of developing Alzheimer's and other types of dementia diseases. This health benefits would contribute to a long term economic gain in the global market as it enables them to perform better and work longer at their workplace. This is not, however, the only way that multilingualism is commodified; multilingualism, especially that which is inclusive of English, is also commodified in elementary and secondary education, adult education, government, the military, and elsewhere in society. This bears out in the higher salaries offered to multilingual workers as well as in the global push for language education. Englishization and English Imperialism Englishization is the use of English as global lingua franca whereby English replaces the local language as a means of communication, especially in organizations, in an attempt to compete economically in a globalized society. Englishization is treated largely as a necessity in business, testament by the rise in English multilingualism as a work requirement in an increasing number of industries, regions, and organizations and by the rise in English as a Foreign Language programs beginning in the 1990s. In Qatar, for example, there is an English-language nursing program aimed at foreign workers who wish to enter the medical field in Qatar . In addition, when applying for a job in South Korea, most local conglomerates like Samsung, LG, CJ, SK, and Doosan require the scores of the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), an English language exam that measures fluency in English of those who use English as their second language and need to use English in their workplace. While programs offering English language skills have broadened access to English internationally, they have been criticized for promoting linguistic imperialism, a phenomenon that entails the transfer of a dominant language to minority language speakers as a result of hegemonic and economic power structures. Robert Phillipson popularized the term linguistic imperialism in 1992 and situated the concept of English spread inside economic and political terrain. Typically, linguistic imperialism first increases multilingualism as speakers add the majority language to their knowledge base. Later, as the majority language demonstrates its ongoing use as capital, many speakers cease using their minority language. The consequences of linguistic imperialism include linguicide, bilingual subtraction, and linguistic devaluation. The spread of English multilingualism is not isolated to the somewhat recent confines of globalization, but has a long colonial history as well. Suhanthie Motha argues that centuries of widespread colonial domination, exploitation, and deliberate English spread have led to modern-day epistemologies about empire and language value. While globalization has furthered these, they were not absent before. Technology and English Multilingualism Shifts in technology associated with globalization have also had an impact on multilingualism and on majority language use generally. Since the 1990s, the widespread use of the internet, and later of smart devices, has expanded the necessity of both receptive language skills like reading and listening and English multilingualism. As evidence to support this, English was the very first language that was used on the internet and more than two-thirds of the information on the internet consisted of English by the mid-90s. Gender Gender and multilingualism were first researched together in the early 1970s with the emergence of language and gender studies. Early studies in the field of language and gender examined how gender affected access to the types of jobs that encouraged multilingualism. Those studies found men more likely to hold agricultural and production-based positions that valued and offered opportunities for multilingualism. As a result, higher percentages of men developed multilingual proficiencies, isolating women from access to certain jobs as a result of their monolingualism. The manner in which multilingualism is transferred to economic capital through globalization is also gendered. Studies demonstrate that women are less successful in transforming linguistic capital to economic capital than their male counterparts. In a study of Swiss multilinguals, for example, researchers demonstrated that women see little difference in income based on proficiency levels above ‚Äúbasic,‚Äù whereas men continue to gain economic benefit from incremental gains between ‚Äúbasic‚Äù and ‚Äúfluent.‚Äù As the field of language and gender expanded in the 1990s, scholars began rejecting essentialist notions of language and gender in favor of exploring them as aspects of social identity. Around this time, researchers also began exploring the cultural underpinnings of language and gender in the workplace, identifying links between the ways in which minority women in particular related their undesirable social location to their use of a minority language. Studies of minority-speaking women in both Austria and France suggest that women are more likely to shift toward the use of majority languages in the hopes of improving their economic and social prospects. Bourdieu calls this a ‚Äúmisrecognition‚Äù of language as the cause of oppression by which women associate a shift in language as a means of liberation when language was not their oppressor to begin with.  Education  As globalization has progressed rapidly, the dissemination of education on multilingualism has also gradually expanded. Japan is one of the states that realized the importance of the education. Japan's renowned Universities, with the government's active support, are increasingly accepting more international students and professors, publicizing foreign language education programs, and sending more students abroad through their study abroad programs. For instance, Waseda University, one of the most prestigious private institution in Japan, is ranked as a top university in Japan for study abroad as it accepted 7,476 international students and sent 4,439 Japanese students abroad in 2017-2018Waseda University International Affairs Division (2018). FACTS 2018 Waseda University [PDF File]. Retrieved from https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/assets/uploads/2018/08/FACTS2018.pdf. The university also teaches 28 foreign languages offering 1,541 language courses. In addition, South Korea is known as one of the countries that sends a large number of domestic students abroad, being ranked fourth in the world. It was estimated by UNESCO's research in 2014 that in the country of 50 million people, there were 116,942 students pursued studying abroad. It is known that the countries where Korean students prefer to study abroad are the United States, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Moreover, based on the 2019 Open Doors' research, as of 2019, the total number of international students currently studying in the United States was reported to be 1,095,299. It was also reported that 341,751 American students participated in the Education Abroad Program in 2018. Among many destinations, Europe was the most popular among American students and more than half of the Education Abroad Program students were sent to European countries in 2018. USA Study Abroad, a federal agency promoting the country's study abroad, has been encouraging 550 domestic students every year to go abroad and acquire foreign languages that would benefit the country's economy and security through their program called the Critical Language Scholarship (CLS).  Growing demand of Multilingualism  The past and current world state is continuously becoming less and less homogeneous on a number of scales. Some of those could be broken down to the amount of information, international trade, capital and immigration different nation states participate in. This can also be measured by the Global Connectedness Index. This mass measurement scale is used to calculate the activities that countries participate in, more specifically the globalization actives listed above that contribute to their economy's wealth. It was found by the Harvard Business Review in 2017 that the DHL had recorded their largest peak recording on the Global Connectedness Index scale to date. As it is shown that our social and economic worlds are becoming more globalized, with it there is strong natural growing demand and need for multilingualism in both the economic and social spheres. The noticeable increase in globalization in the past has resulted in the UNICEF's support for multilingual programs in school systems. At the 2019 UNICEF Bangkok conference, Andrew Glass the Director of British Council Thailand stated on behalf of the UNICEF, \\"Multilingual education prepares learners for the challenges of the 21st century, language sustains cultural diversity, connects people with cultures, aids in understanding, and builds trust,\\". This statement made of behalf of the UNICEF has appropriately portrayed the rising levels of bi or multilingualism. Countries in different parts of the world, United States included are becoming more populated with persons living in a country separate from which they were born in. As of 2011 there are over 20 million people living in the United States who do not dominantly speak English, calling for more a linguistically equip workforce in the future. The growing need for a more multilingual workforce is apparent in the U.S. according to survey and analysis completed in 2014. Multiple scholars from George town, Harvard, and Michigan University collected sample data from employers on their knowledge of a second language requirements for the hiring process. Its shown that across different business sizes a large proportion of employers actively seek out graduates who have ties with language nonnative to the area of employment.  Korean Wave  The relationship between listening to music and furthering the ability to retain a new language are found to be positively correlated. People partake in listening to music to learn another language and some partake in learning a different language to be able to understand music. According to the Modern Language Association it was reported that in 2016 there was a noticeable steady increase of enrollment in Korean language university courses within the United States, correlated with the rise of the Korean wave or \\"Hallyu.\\" For example, from the late 1990s it has been recognized that a rise in the dissemination of Korean culture worldwide through music and media exists. Becoming multilingual for the sake of participating in Korean culture is one way the Korean wave has engaged in process of globalization, nonetheless there are also more notable instances as well. According to the University of Hawaii Press populations outside of Korea in Israel and Palestine have been effected by this type of globalization. In places such as these locations that are now consuming Korean culture there are growing numbers in social science and anthropological academic writings written about countries whom are not their own, Korea being just one of them. This process of widening the spectrum of information on world cultures readily available in different parts of the world is reversing the effects of homogenization of information in power states.

Much of this music has been recorded and preserved. Each song of the Ute tribe has a meaning or is based on an experience. These experiences may be social, religious or emotional. Many Ute songs are social songs. They include war songs, social dance songs, parade songs, medicine songs, love songs, game songs and story songs.Densmore, Frances. ‚ÄúMusic of the Indians in Our Western States.‚Äù The Journal of American Folklore, vol. 70, no. 276, 1957, pp. 176‚Äì178. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/537302Hanson, William F. The Lure of Tam-Man Nacup, Springtime Festival of the Utes. Master's thesis, Brigham Young University, 1937.  Background  Similar to other Indigenous American music, much of Ute music is about or inspired by nature. These people even referred to nature as \\"mother,\\" indicating how sacred they held it. Many Ute songwriters, particularly from Northern Ute tribes, have also claimed to have received their music through dreams. Like most indigenous people, the Ute Native Americans in the Great Basin struggled with people traveling into their land and trying to take over, such as the Spanish and the Mormons. Their music continued to be a light for their people through these times.  General characteristics  Most songs are chants. There are few lyrics. The expression of the histories and meanings of the songs rely more heavily on the emotions of the singer than the words sung. The singing is done with a guttural tight tone, and the tone is never clear or even. One Ute singer described proper singing tone to resemble singing while riding a galloping horse. Ranges are usually more narrow and often remain within an octave. Most songs tend to start on higher notes and descend down to lower registers as the song progresses. Tones may sound flat or sharp to some because natural modes are used rather than pursuing accuracy of pitch. The majority of these tones remain consistent. Like most Native American music, Ute music does not have rhythmic groups such as measures.  Instrumentation  The Utes use common Native American musical instruments for their war and dance songs. These include the morache, hand drum, large drum, and the flageolet. = Morache = The morache has been a common instrument among indigenous American tribes. Mr. E. H. Hawley, curator of musical instruments at the United States National Museum in Washington D.C., described it simply as a \\"notched stick rattle with resonator.\\"Densmore, Frances. Northern Ute Music. Washington Government Printing Office: Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology, 1922. It is played by rubbing a short stick or bone across a longer stick with notches cut into its side. Originally, the sound was resonated by placing one end of the longer stick on a shallow basket. However, many have now come to use a piece of zinc instead of the basket.Indigenous American hand drum = Hand drum = The hand drum is a small drum, about 12 inches in diameter. It is fashioned with a piece of wood bent into a circle. A wet skin head is stretched across the head, with holes in the skin corresponding to holes in the wood to secure the skin to the wood. A handle is made from two strips of cotton cloth, with a strip of cloth tying them together in the middle of the drum to form a cross. The drum is played by hitting the skin with a drumstick formed out of a round stick with a head of white cloth wrapped around one of the ends. = Large drum = For some dances, such as the Turkey dance and Women's dance, a much larger drum was formed. Anywhere from 8 to 10 singers will sit around this drum, singing as they drum. There have been known to be as many as 14 seated around the drum. = Flageolet = Examples of Native American woodwind instruments The flageolet is a form of wind instrument. It is similar to flageolets used by other indigenous American tribes, and somewhat resembles a common flageolet. It is made from a straight piece of wood. The piece is hollowed by splitting it in half, removing the pith, and gluing the pieces back together. It is approximately 11 inches long, and just over an inch wide in diameter. The instrument is played through a whistle mouthpiece, and covering a number of the 6 sound holes with the fingers. It is known to have good tone, and was sometimes moistened to improve quality of the tone. The Ute flageolet was said to have an extended range but was specific to Indian music. A creator and player of the flageolet in a Ute tribe once said \\"American song tunes cannot be played on it but Indian music can be played on it.\\" = Vocal = A major aspect of Ute music is the singing. Native American singing is in many ways unique and the vocal method, according to American anthropologist Frances Densmore, can be difficult to describe. Common features include an exaggerated tremolo and a certain approach where the tone is sung sharp then quickly slides down to the sustained tone. A Native American singer will use a contraction of the glottis to separate tones, which allows for distinct short note values for eighth and sixteenth notes without having to use words or syllables.  Dancing  The music of the Utes is also accompanied by dance. The dancing is filled with symbolism.McPherson, Robert S. ‚ÄúCircles, Trees, and Bears: Symbols of Power of the Weenuche Ute.‚Äù American Indian Culture & Research Journal 36, no. 2 (June 2012): 103‚Äì29. Ute People participating in the Bear Dance = Ute Bear Dance = An iconic ceremonial dance of the Ute tribe is the Bear Dance. There are many different Bear dance songs with complex rhythms and melodies. They are often sung and danced at festivals lasting multiple days, up to a week, such as the Tam-Nam Nacup Springtime Festival. Some claim the dance was originally used as a courting dance, but today it is mostly a dance of sociability and general good feeling.  Origin  The Ute Bear Dance comes from a common story told by the leaders of the tribe. The dance is said to be as old as the culture itself. There are many different versions of the story. One common recounting is about a Ute man who goes out to hunt at the end of winter. As he was traveling, he sees a bear emerge from a cave that it had been sleeping in all winter. As it walks outside it starts to dance, moving forward and backward. As the man is watching from afar he is afraid to move closer because the bear might attack him. He studies the movement of the bear from afar. He likes what he sees and goes back to tell the people about what he had learned.  Music  The music involves singing as well as drums and a morache. The morache is used to produce a growling cry meant to imitate the howl of a bear. Glissandos on downward progressions are also used to imitate bear sounds. There is a steady drum beat played as the morache is grated up and down. The rhythm is more monotonous and the rhythmic sense is stronger than the melodic sense. The Bear dance is typically sung only by the men.  Dance  The dance itself comes from the story to which previously referred. It is named Mamaqui Mawats, meaning \\"to move forward and back.\\" This relates to the way the bear moved as he came out of the cave. It begins with a member of the band approaching the band leader, requesting to give the dance. This request could be accepted or declined. It is more of a social dance, but has some religious aspects as well. The dance is led by the Bear Dance leader, who was the man who initiated the dance with the band. The dance involves men and women, who face different directions. The women face toward the band and the men face toward the east, the opposite direction that women are facing.  Religious beliefs about the dance  Ute belief holds that they descended from bears. The bear is considered the wisest of all the animals. Long ago it was believed that the Ute people would turn into bears before they died. While they believe transfiguration ended long ago and doesn't occur to those living today, they still maintain special connection with the bears, as they still believe they are distantly related. The dance itself created a bridge between the people and their ancestors. It became sacred to those participating. All things considered, it is commonly known as a social dance, and those involved have a lot of fun.  Documentation and ethnology  Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief with phonograph Ute folklore songs have been handed down for generations. They were never written down. Rather, they were always learned by rote. However, since the beginning of the twentieth century, many anthropologists and ethnologists have worked to preserve and archive this music. = Frances Densmore = Frances Densmore was one of the primary contributors to the thorough documentation of the music of over 30 different Indian tribes in the United States and Canada, including the Ute tribe. Her primary tools were a phonograph cylinder recorder and a box camera.Boggs, Johnny D. ‚ÄúFrances Densmore‚Äôs Fight to Preserve Indian Music.‚Äù Wild West 28, no. 5 (February 2016): 26‚Äì27. https://www-lib-byu-edu.erl.lib.byu.edu/cgi- bin/remoteauth.pl?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=asn&AN;=110907353&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site. Most of her studies were done under the support of the Bureau of American Ethnology, for which she was hired between 1907 and 1933, and again after 1939.Archabal, Nina Marchetti, Barbara Stuhler, and Gretchen Kreuter. ‚ÄúFrances Densmore: Pioneer in the Study of American Indian Music.‚Äù In Women of Minnesota: Selected Biographical Essays, 94‚Äì115, 1977. Over the years of study, she came to develop a theory of Indian music, recognizing and appreciating the distinction between the interpretation of its melodies and harmonies and that of Western music. As part of her years of research for the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, she recorded 3,591 cylinders of indigenous music and analysis thereof. These were later transferred to the National Archives and then to the Library of Congress. There they were duplicated onto 16 inch acetate discs. By 1915 about 900 songs had been phonographically recorded, and over the cumulative course of her work for the Smithsonian over 2,400 songs were transcribed. This is considered one of the \\"great recorded treasures of the American people.\\" Densmore, Frances, writer. Songs of the Pawnee: Songs of the Northern Ute. Library of Congress, Division of Music, Recording Laboratory, 1951, CDDensmore, Frances. \\"The Study of Indian Music.\\" The Musical Quarterly 1, no. 2 (1915): 187-97. https://www.jstor.org/stable/737845. Her ethnological contributions to the preservation of Ute music are extensive. = Opposition to documentation = There are some who oppose the documentation of indigenous music, specifically the work of Frances Densmore. A woman by the name of Marcie Rendon wrote a play titled: \\"Song Catcher: A Native Interpretation of the Story of Frances Densmore\\". Rendon is an American indigenous woman herself and has rejected Frances Densmore's work, primarily because Densmore did not belong to the same culture.Peters, Gretchen. ‚ÄúUnlocking the Songs: Marcie Rendon‚Äôs Indigenous Critique of Frances Densmore‚Äôs Native Music Collecting.‚Äù American Indian Culture & Research Journal, vol. 39, no. 4, Oct. 2015, pp. 79‚Äì92. EBSCOhost, doi:10.17953/aicrj.39.4.peters. The play goes into detail about how Densmore's work could be considered an invasion of privacy. Set in modern day, from the perspective of indigenous people, it considers how such a study could be harmful to those being studied. Along with Rendon, some Native American people argue that the indigenous music should remain within their society.

He is one of the most popular League of Legends online personalities with more than 3.4 million followers on Twitch. Steinkamp was banned from playing League of Legends from April 2016 to January 2018 for disruptive behavior towards other players, earning him the nickname of \\"The Most Toxic Player in North America\\". His first League of Legends stream after reinstatement peaked at over 386,000 viewers on Twitch, a figure that was noted as the website's largest non-tournament concurrent viewership at the time.  Career  = Initial popularity and ban = Steinkamp ranked 14th on the North American League of Legends ladder in 2014, but his stream had a modest following until 2016. Steinkamp originally became known in the League of Legends community for toxic behavior shown on his stream, which included personally attacking others, encouraging players to commit suicide, and intentionally losing the game to the detriment of his teammates. This behavior eventually led to permanent bans on 22 unique accounts over several years. Steinkamp's stream rapidly grew in popularity in April 2016, when he publicly announced that he had \\"reformed.\\" His Twitch channel reportedly increased from around 5,700 followers before the announcement to over 92,000 followers by the end of the month. His improved behavior quickly lapsed but his following continued to grow, prompting several high profile and professional players to condemn his behavior. Those opposed to Steinkamp's behavior believed his popularity would encourage and normalize player toxicity, and criticized developer Riot Games for not taking action to prevent this behavior. On April 30, 2016, Riot Games employee \\"Riot Socrates\\" announced that due to \\"a well-documented history of account bans for verbal abuse\\" and player harassment, Steinkamp would no longer be allowed to own a League of Legends account, saying \\"we want you to know when the rare player comes along who's a genuine jerk, we've still got your back.\\" Under a Riot Games practice known as ID Banning, accounts Steinkamp played publicly on stream would be immediately banned, even if rules had yet to be broken on the account. To date, this type of ban has only happened a few times in League of Legends history. After becoming banned, Steinkamp was forced to branch out from playing League of Legends, continuing to grow his fan base as his stream became more eccentric. His stream gained media attention when he acted out a 45-minute action parody of his life in front of a green screen for April Fools' Day in 2018 called \\"A Day in the Life of Tyler1\\". He also continued to stream other games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. In October 2017, Riot Games employee Aaron \\"Sanjuro\\" Rutledge made insulting remarks about Steinkamp in the official r/LeagueOfLegends Subreddit's Discord server, saying he looked like a \\"homunculus\\" and that he would die \\"from a coke overdose or testicular cancer from all the steroids.\\" The company responded saying \\"what was said is NOT okay, and we take it extremely seriously\\", apologizing to Steinkamp and to the League of Legends community. Steinkamp responded to the incident saying, \\"It really sucks that some people still hold a grudge... and refuse to acknowledge I've changed.\\" A few days later, investigative esports journalist Richard Lewis reported that Rutledge no longer worked at Riot Games. = Return = In late 2017, Steinkamp announced on stream that he received an email from Riot Games that his ban would be lifted at the end of the year if the accounts he played in the last month were \\"clean\\" of abusive behavior. In January 2018, Steinkamp announced that he had been unbanned, which was later confirmed with Riot Games by Kotaku. Tyler's first stream after he became unbanned in January 2018 peaked at over 382,000 viewers, breaking the record for the most concurrent viewers for an individual streamer on Twitch set by Faker in 2017. This record was broken a month later by Dr DisRespect's first stream after returning from a 2-month hiatus, although due to conflicting media reporting and technical issues with Twitch, sources disagree whether the record was actually broken. During an angry rant about recent changes to the game, Steinkamp admitted he was addicted to League of Legends, prompting other members of the community to share their addiction stories and share advice from Riot Games employees. Steinkamp is a popular League of Legends online personality. In February 2018, he surpassed 30,000 paid subscribers on his Twitch channel. As of July 2020, Steinkamp's Twitch channel has over 3 million followers and 170 million views, and his YouTube channel has over 2 million subscribers and 300 million views. = Tyler1 Championship Series = In November 2017, Steinkamp hosted an online League of Legends tournament called the Tyler1 Championship Series (TCS). A parody of the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), Steinkamp streamed in front of a green screen to images of LCS stadiums and a commentators' desk. The tournament peaked at over 200,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch and was viewed by professional players and LCS casters. The winning team was awarded $10,000, funded from Steinkamp directly and without any sponsors. In November 2018, the Tyler1 Championship Series made its return, this time with an increased prize pool of $50,000, funded again by Steinkamp directly. Rift Herald particularly praised its improvement in quality compared to the previous tournament, stating \\"What started out as a meme... has morphed into something resembling a real online third-party tournament. There are impressive graphics, sleek and seamless replays and a parade of community talent that's been brought in to help host and cast the event.\\" Personal life Steinkamp was born on March 7, 1995, in Missouri. He is of partial African American descent.https://www.dexerto.com/league-of- legends/tyler1-explains-why-hell-never-get-banned-from-league-of- legends-1336460 He studied computer science at Central Methodist University before withdrawing to focus on his streaming career.

It is home to the longest running play in Off-Off Broadway history, Israel Horovitz's Line which began its run at the 65-seat venue in 1974. The theater is presently under the leadership of Artistic Director Joe John Battista, who mounts premiere productions, experimental plays, and revivals. 13th Street Rep ran its first contracted Off Broadway show in July 2018, the acclaimed BAHR production of Jerry Small's Before We're Gone, directed by Battista. Other recent productions include a revival of Tom Eyen's Women Behind Bars directed by Joe John Battista and featuring in the ensemble Amy Stiller as Gloria. History The theatre is in the basement level of a townhouse located at 50 West 13th Street, parts of which date back to the late 1700s. There exists a trap door in what was formerly a carriage house, now the theater's backstage dressing room, that leads down to a cellar dating back to the Pre-Civil War Era. That cellar was a Greenwich Village way station on the Underground Railroad. In the 1940s, 50 West 13th Street was a popular ceramics studio and hub for artists. From the early 1960s, the building's basement level became a performance space called The 13th Street Theatre, one of many small Off-Off Broadway venues that were springing up in the early years of the Off-Off Broadway Movement. The Drunkard, the first musical by then 19-year old composer Barry Manilow, performed at the space on weekends from 1964-1970, promising its audiences \\"free beer or root beer\\" during its two shows a night. In 1972, Edith O'Hara, a theater maker, former newspaper reporter, and schoolteacher from Idaho, founded the 13th Street Repertory Theatre at 50 West 13th Street as a place for actors, directors, playwrights, and designers to develop and create theater arts in a supportive environment. Her earliest production in New York was Kenn Long and Jim Crozier's musical Touch, whose score went on to earn a Grammy nomination. She championed one of the first productions on the subject of same sex marriage, Bill Solly and Donald Ward's Boy Meets Boy, which afterwards became a hit and moved to a commercial run. In 1974, she presented Israel Horovitz's expressionistic comedy Line, which famously went on to become the longest running play in Off-Off Broadway history. Performer and TV personality Brother Theodore performed his \\"stand up tragedy\\" act there on and off for over twenty years. In addition to the presentation of new theater works, O'Hara has stressed the importance of entertaining young audiences and educating young artists. She spearheaded a program for young people called Mama Hare's Tree, which continues today as the Kid City Theater after school musical program, presently run by Wendy Tonken. For Edith O'Hara's leadership and artistic contribution she has received citations from President Barack Obama, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. O‚ÄôHara, who in 2016 celebrated her one hundredth birthday, has two daughters, Jill O‚ÄôHara and Jenny O'Hara who are Broadway and film actors. Her son is singer/songwriter Jack O'Hara, a founding member of the country rock band Eggs Over Easy. Tennessee Williams, while giving a talkback after a revival performance of his play Outcry at 13th Street Rep, sat on the edge of its platform and proclaimed that the future of New York Theater is to be found on the small stage.

He was appointed by the infant king Louis XIV of France during the regency of Anne of Austria at a time when the colonies were owned by the French West India Company. His predecessor refused to recognise his appointment, forcefully prevented him from taking office on Saint Christopher Island, and eventually had him arrested and returned to France. In the aftermath the discredited company sold the islands to their local governors and was dissolved. Predecessor Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy was named captain general by the French West India Company on 5 January 1638 and was appointed the king's lieutenant general in the American islands on 25 February 1638. He was received in Martinique on 11 February 1639 and in Saint Christopher Island three days later. His commission was confirmed in 1640, 1641 and in January 1642. When the company would not give him the resources he needed to develop the islands he decided to do so in Saint Christopher at his own expense, while favouring his personal business interests over those of the company. He went deeply into debt. His efforts to develop production of cotton and indigo failed. He wrote to the company asking for reimbursement of the huge sums he had spent on developing Saint Christopher. The governor of the English part of the island, Thomas Warner, worked with Poincy to suppress resistance to their authority from the independent-minded settlers, who were suffering from growing competition in the tobacco trade from the Americas. Poincy was a quarrelsome man and a harsh authoritarian and earned many enemies. The company therefore decided to terminate his commission and look for a replacement. Appointment No√´l Patrocle de Thoisy, a Burgundian, was chosen as the governor general to replace Poincy. His father was in favour with the regent, Anne of Austria, and she would have suggested his name. The company appointed Thoisy governor general on 26 December 1644. No√´l Patrocles, chevalier, seigneur de Thoisy, a king's councillor, was named the King's lieutenant general of the American Islands on 20 February 1645. His commission gave him \\"the power to preside over the courts of justice of Saint Christopher.\\" On 16 February 1645 the company arranged for a lettre de cachet from the king that ordered Poincy to return to France. Poincy's nephew, Robert de Longvilliers, who was ready to embark at La Rochelle, was handed the order to be delivered personally to Poincy. On 25 February 1645 the lords of the French West India Company made Thoisy the Seneschal of Saint Christopher Island. Poincy received the order to return on 13 March 1645. In July 1645 he expelled the intendant general, Clerselier de Leumont, who retired to Guadeloupe, and sent his most troublesome opponents back to France. Another lettre de cachet from the king dated 18 August 1645 formally demanded that Poincy leave the Antilles. On 22 August Longvilliers was confirmed as governor of Saint Christopher. On 1 September 1645 the company's Assembly of Lords in Paris commanded Robert de Longvilliers, governor of Saint Christopher, to receive Thoisy as the king's lieutenant general for the American islands. Disputed governor general Thoisy left Le Havre on 2 September 1645. He was accompanied by Jean-Fran√ßois de Boisfey, lieutenant de pr√©v√¥t√©, Claude Meline and three archers, Fredon, Dufey and Saint-Ange. He landed in Martinique on 14 November 1645. Thoisy arrived at Guadeloupe on 19 November 1645. He reached Saint Christophe on 25 November 1645. His captain of the guard went ashore to deliver the orders for his reception, and was met by a body of armed men whose leader said on behalf of Poincy that the people of the island would accept no other leader than Poincy, and would not obey the king. Thoisy then went to the English base at Sandy Point, where Sir Thomas Warner told him that only Poincy's servant could land. On 28 November 1645 he returned to Guadeloupe. Thoisy and Governor Charles Hou√´l du Petit Pr√© of Guadeloupe made a plan to overcome Poincy by force. They dropped their plan when Governor Jacques Dyel du Parquet of Martinique arrived and proposed to kidnap Poincy's two nephews and use them as pawns to force submission. In January 1646 Thoisy, with the support of du Parquet, led an expedition against Poincy and captured Poincy's two nephews. Poincy's forces, supported by militia provided by Warner, then defeated the company from Martinique at the cost of 60 deaths. Thoisy escaped to Guadeloupe. Parquet took refuge first with the Capuchins and then with the English governor Warner, who promptly gave him up to Poincy. Three cousins of Jacques Dyel, captains Jacques Maupas Saint-Aubin and Pierre and Jean Lecomte fled to Martinique where they took an oath that recognised Thoisy as the king's lieutenant general. Hou√´l arrived from Guadeloupe on 28 January with a new expedition but was not able to disembark and returned to Guadeloupe on 3 February. Poincy expelled the Capuchins from Saint Christopher for having preached obedience to the king's orders, and ordered or allowed reprisals, sometimes death, for those who supported Thoisy. By June there was rioting throughout the islands. On 16 and 28 October 1646 the king ordered Poincy and Thoisy to exchange prisoners, thus implicitly giving Poincy an amnesty for his revolt since he was opposed to the company and its abuses rather than opposed to the king. In November 1646 Hou√´l started a revolt against Thoisy, claiming that his presence on Gaudeloupe deprived him of his rights as governor. Thoisy managed to end the revolt on 22 November with a display of friendship for Hou√´l. Thoisy heard that he was to be assassinated, and on 31 December 1646 embarked for Martinique, which he reached on 3 January 1647. Capture and return to France On 31 December 1646 the officers of Martinique arranged with Poincy to exchange Thoisy for du Parquet. In January Poincy sent La Vernade to Martinique with five ships and 800 men to seize Thoisy. On 17 January 1647 Thoisy was arrested by the people of Martinique and delivered to Poincy in exchange for Du Parquet. Thoisy was taken to Saint Christophe, where he arrived on 24 January 1846. While passing Guadeloupe La Vernade embarked one of Poincy's nephews, Longvilliers, against the promise that Du Parquet would be released. The other nephew, Tr√©val, remained as a hostage. Thoisy was held prisoner in Saint Christopher, but due to expressions of sympathy for him by the population Poincy embarked him for France at night at the end of April, where he arrived on 17 May 1646. He said Poincy let him have just \\"two shirts and a greatcoat\\". Aftermath Du Parquet was released on 6 February. He returned to Martinique on 9 February 1677. On 25 February the king, unaware of the events in the West Indies, named Poincy as lieutenant general in Saint Christophe for a year, and Thoisy as lieutenant general of Martinique and Guadeloupe, with his residence in Guadeloupe. After Poincy's term ended, Thoisy would become lieutenant general of all the islands. The lords of the company confirmed this on 26 March 1647. After Thoisy's return to France a trial was launched in which Poincy was condemned to pay Thoisy 90,000 livres. The trial dragged out and did much damage to the company's reputation. The result of the chaotic events on the islands was that the West India Company was dissolved. The du Parquet family became owners of Guadeloupe and Martinique. A lawsuit between Poincy and Thoisy continued in 1649 and 1650, complicating settlement of the company's affairs, but finally on 24 May 1651 the Order of Malta bought Saint Christopher to be held for life by Poincy, when Saint Christopher, Saint-Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy would revert to the Order. The sale was ratified in March 1653 and the company ceased to exist.

Early life Moreno explains that she is named Conchita because she was born on the day of the Immaculate Conception, the second of seven, to Norberto Moreno Mayora (a builder from Ocumare del Tuy, who constructed the famous Las Palomas area of Macuto) and Juana D'Amico del Castillo (a textile worker who may have been the first woman to use an electric loom). Her maternal grandparents were Italian, and emigrated to Venezuela before her mother's birth. Moreno said that she was raised in a very Christian household, and had little means, also living with other older female family members. As a child, she had wanted to be a lawyer, and says that her eldest granddaughter did become one. When Moreno first sought out bullfighting it was during the Second World War, after having snuck out of school to watch the bullfights in El Valle, Caracas, where she spent most of her childhood. She says that she went in secret with her mother, and that when she expressed her desire to bullfight to her father he wasn't impressed, accusing her mother of \\"coddling\\". She says that her father said his objections were because of how masculine the sport is, but she suspects that he wanted her to go to university because she was good in school. Career =Career beginnings= After dabbling in bullfighting in school and expressing an interest to her parents, Moreno says that her desire became more founded when the cuadrilla of female bullfighters came to show in Caracas. Despite still being in high school, she spoke to the crew and managed to get a \\"casting\\" to join the team, in which she was successful. However, it was only after the war ended and normalcy resumed that she fully decided to take up bullfighting, in 1947. However, the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat maintained a level of disruption in her country, and so she says that she \\"wanted to quickly learn as much as I could about bullfighting, and leave\\". Moreno says that she made a deal with her parents, including going to university, to be allowed to train; her father also became one of her harshest critics, telling her before her first presentation that if she was going to fight, she would have to do it well. It was only the Sunday after her first fight that Moreno had her alternativa. She notes that since Juanita Cruz, a bullfighter from Madrid, had visited Caracas, the sport had grown more popular in the city, and there was a lot of hype around this fight. She faced off in the alternativa with Esther √Ålvarez, a relative of famous banderillero Cipriano √Ålvarez. Moreno says that she still remembers this fight with warmth, because it is when she cut her first ear. In her early years of fighting, Moreno was working in a law firm in Venezuela, having got her degree, taking English classes and fighting at weekends. After some time, her commitments to her cuadrilla meant that she would have to travel abroad for fights, and she says that even though she was an adult by this time and had met all of her father's requirements, he still wouldn't sign the travel documents to let her leave the country ‚Äî she says that her family were worried she could be hurt and they'd never find out ‚Äî so her mother signed the papers behind his back, and loaned her some money to make up the cost of the plane ticket. =Tours of Latin America= Moreno's first travels were to Mexico, where she fought in Guadalajara, Tampico, Veracruz, Xochimilco, Tijuana and Acapulco. In Mexico City, Moreno met the bullfighter Mar√≠a Cobi√°n, \\"La Serranita\\", who told Moreno of her desire to travel to Spain to fight, but that she would not do so, because in Spain the women were only allowed to fight bulls on horseback. It was during the Mexico fights that they were hired to present in Colombia, successfully travelling through Cartagena, Barranquilla, Cali, Manizales and Bogot√°. The cuadrilla then continued travelling south, and performed in Peru; here in Lima is where Moreno suffered a serious injury to her right leg. Whilst traveling Latin America, Moreno received news that her father had taken sick. She quit the cuadrilla and returned home, finding her father gravely ill. She says that she felt guilty for spending so much time away, and promised her father that she wouldn't travel again. However, she added that she \\"took advantage of the time in Caracas to build contacts in Portugal\\". She found representation as a freelance bullfighter, and began training on horseback, because since speaking to Cobi√°n \\"Spain, the birthplace of bullfighting, hadn't left [her] thoughts\\". She said that at this point she decided that if she were to return to bullfighting, it would be as a rejoneadora. After her father died, Moreno took up the sport full-time again, travelling the interior of Venezuela in exhibition performances with her brother Benjam√≠n. They came up with a business of traveling bullrings, to bring the show to smaller communities, and combined circus acts with the fights, building a collapsible tent for their show that could also be transported with attached wheels when erected. =Move to Europe= Whilst in Venezuela, her agent called and requested she return to Caracas, because she had received an offer in Portugal. With this news, Benjam√≠n chose to join the Navy, and their sister Victoria joined Conchita's team helping with administration. She took a boat to Vigo, and stayed with the D'a Silva family in Lisbon. In only a few months, she had debuted at the Campo Pequeno bullring. She says that she enjoyed it more here, because the bulls were not killed and even the banderillas were designed to not harm them. After some time, the agent had made contacts and got her a contract in Spain. Moreno took the train to Madrid and was greeted by Manuel C√≥rdoba, who would become her representation for the Iberian peninsula. However, when news got around that she was in Spain, the bullfighting community published dissents, assuming that she had gone to fight on foot. Despite her assurances, and other peoples' defences, the main players of the Madrid bullfighting community but a black mark on her name. Moreno continued training, and C√≥rdoba got her some fights in France. In Marseille she presented in a series called the \\"Bolivariana\\" where other Venezuelan bullfighters were presenting ‚Äî C√≥rdoba had already informed her that many had followed her move to Europe, and she had met with some in Spain. Here, she performed a complex bullfight (also feigned to not harm the bull) on horseback. Moreno says that she, like other female and foreign bullfighters, continued to perform in France and Portugal, suggesting that even after she had shown she was not continuing to fight on foot the Spaniards did not want \\"invaders\\" joining their industry. However, they did lift the mark on her name and allowed her to take Spanish contracts after some time, and she eventually got to \\"fulfil [her] biggest wish\\": to perform at Las Ventas. She continued to travel, and in the Northern winter she took work in the Americas, instead, spending time in Latin America again, as well as in Texas, New Mexico, and Baja California in the United States, but spent a lot of the rest of her career in Europe. =Benavente injury and retirement= Moreno suffered a traumatic head injury at the Plaza de Benavente in Benavente, Zamora, Spain, in a fight between Hispanic nations in 1958. She was on her Arabian horse named \\"Moreno\\" and got into the last moments of the bullfight, when \\"Moreno\\" could not back away and was hit by the bull's charge, causing both Moreno and \\"Moreno\\" to crash into the side of the ring, with \\"Moreno\\" landing on her. She was rushed to La Milagrosa hospital. The injury fractured her skull, and she was comatose for 25 days. After coming round, she was advised by doctors to stop fighting, which she chose to do, wanting to recover. She has mentioned that it reminded her of her first injury in Peru, which made her lose fear in the bullring. She has suggested that her agent at the time shouldn't have taken the contract, because the bullring was so small, but once it had been accepted they couldn't cancel. After Moreno's death, her daughter Mar√≠a Esperanza began collecting documents of her legacy, and received a letter from Pilar Huerga Mielgo in Benavente, who said that \\"many of those who attended that bullfight thought, and ran into the square convinced, that that young girl \\"of the big, beautiful eyes\\" had fatefully died, due to the seriousness of the accident.\\" Moreno's recovery took several months, which was mostly spent in a specialist center for toreros in Madrid, before she returned to Venezuela. She still suffered symptoms for many years after the injury, including partial memory loss and occasional paralysis on her right side. Initially, she could not even walk and struggled with simple things, and she thanks God for her safety. She suffered the injury after living in Spain for six years, and returned to Venezuela to start a family. Personal life Moreno says that after leaving, whenever she was in Venezuela, she tried to see her family. She has also said that her career made it impossible to have a relationship, though she dated a little. She says that she dated a famous singer in Mexico who became very obsessive and possessive, causing her to flee first to her mother's house, and then back to Europe. When she returned to Venezuela, she had a large family. She has publicly criticised the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona. Sources suggest she also co-starred in the 1957 Brazilian Western film .

He is surrounded by dead soldiers as well as a living caged smilodon in the background. He gives water to Bernard Delacroix, a wounded scientist for Soteira brought into their service to work on their de-extinction project. He is shocked to see Wolverine alive and begs to be released from the will of Soteira by having Wolverine kill him with his claws. Suddenly, a grenade rolls into the laboratory killing Bernard and freeing the Smilodon who attacks Wolverine, triggering a brief memory of Kitty Pryde. The smilodon is then gored by a woolly mammoth that was also released in the explosion as Wolverine sees a variety of past memories of himself advising him to go after Soteira before they harm everyone else. Hearing machine gun fire that has killed the woolly mammoth at the cost of its attackers at the outside entrance, Wolverine rides a motorcycle down to a work camp on the shore that is soon engulfed in flames as evacuations orders are announced over the PA system. He witnesses a sniper shooting a fleeing scientist. Upon returning fire on the sniper, the masked soldier is revealed to be White Sky's Omega Red clone who shoots out the front tire of Wolverine's motorcycle. Thrown from the wreck and hitting his head on a rock, he eventually loses consciousness and dreams about Soteira's leader Persephone who guides him through a prison block of incarcerated past memories of himself, enemies, and comrades. She denies his allegations of being evil and claims to have brought him back to life as she kisses him. Wolverine is wakened by a worker from the camp's canteen named Ana who recognizes him as a famous superhero and pleads for his help to rescue her son Perren who has been ordered into custody by one of the soldiers. While realizing that his healing factor has reactivated, there is one wound on his right side that hasn't healed. Ana states that the location he's in is Soteira's research facility where they have collected scientists from all over to help with their work. As Ana staples his wound, Wolverine voices a theory that Ana's son might be used as an incubator of sorts, as she tells him that he was injected with something from their labs before it was destroyed. As Wolverine still has fragmented memories even unable to recognize his own name, Ana recalls a story she heard about him where a man in machine gun armor attacked a hospital as Wolverine selflessly fought to stop him, without regard to his own safety. As Wolverine remembers his name upon unlocking this memory, he hears Ana's claim that Persephone is \\"the devil\\" and Soteira's architect. Now suited in one of Soteira's black uniforms, Wolverine decides that it's time to meet Persephone.Return of Wolverine #1. Marvel Comics. Somewhere on the ocean, Wolverine and Ana are on a speedboat pursuing a boat filled with Soteira operatives. He asks Ana what she means about Persephone having a city to which she says that they are testing something there. Wolverine states that Perren may be confined below, as they don't see him on the deck of the boat. Omega Red and another operative are ordered overboard and jump into the water to ambush them. Ana comments that a famous singer once came to the Soteira facility where Wolverine met her while other scientists remained with their equipment. Most of the scientists left in big trucks while the support staff remained to wait for the Killteam. As their speedboat is boarded by Omega Red and the other operative, Ana fires a harpoon gun through Omega Red's head, hurling him off the boat. Wolverine takes on an opponent who has the same claws as Daken until the fight causes rips in his outfit enough to expose his tattoos. As they fight, Wolverine has a vision of a tattooed Daken in a cell and sees a scarred Wolverine ordering to be let out, smashing his head against the bars of his cell door. As his ranting \\"out\\" becomes more intense, Wolverine's claws begin to glow red hot and he uses them to ignite the fuel from the outboard motor's fuel line and immolate Daken, throwing him off the boat. Wolverine in his rage nearly slashes Ana, who pleads for him to stop. He has a vision of holding the key to the scarred Wolverine's cell, but regains his composure and refuses to unlock the door. Grinning sadistically, the scarred Wolverine assures him \\"Soon bub, soon.\\" Exhausted, Wolverine apologizes to Ana and she tells him that the stories she's heard of him did not mention red hot claws. Wolverine tells her that when his claws got hot, he loses control to them and they seem to consume all of his stamina. With an engine lost in the fight, Soteira's boat has sped out of range, but Wolverine still has their scent. Ana thanks Logan for his selflessness with a kiss before they soon arrive at Soteira's island-city. Meanwhile at the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Jean Grey is using Cerebro and she tells Kitty Pride that she just found Logan.Return of Wolverine #2. Marvel Comics. At the X-Mansion, Kitty informs Storm that Jean Grey used Cerebro to find Wolverine. Kitty Pryde suggests that they take extreme caution over recent events that had Soteira using Wolverine for as they should take the X-Men members that he knows well. Meanwhile at Soteira's island-city, Wolverine recalls Ana's statement that Soteira is running an experiment here. Kitty Pryde, Storm, Jean Grey, Iceman, and Nightcrawler arrive to look for Wolverine when they are attacked by the local police officers and some civilians. Jean states that she can't get anything from the people as she claims that they are hollow. Wolverine picks up the scent of the conflict. Elsewhere on the island-city, a Soteira operative called Zagreus informs Persephone of the fight in the park and asks if they should take action. Persephone states that this could be good for them to observe as she recalls how Wolverine's claws were glowing when he defeated Daken on the boat. As Zagreus states that the X-Men violated Persephone's warnings, he asks how many X-Gene carriers should be killed at the hands of a killteam. She states that Kitty Pryde will be distracted worrying about the pre-mutants as Soteira will focus on their larger plan. In the meantime, she is looking forward to a fight between Wolverine vs. the X-Men. Wolverine finds an injured civilian who claims that the X-Men must be associated with Soteira. Wolverine has a vision of his X-Force persona telling him that he can help out due to his knowledge of their powers and weaknesses. Wolverine then recalls that under duress, Nightcrawler resorts to predictable patterns. Anticipating his next reappearance, Wolverine retracts his claws and punches Nightcrawler in the face. Attempting to attack Jean, he is suddenly encased in ice by Iceman who pleads with get Logan to calm down and listen to reason. Facing defeat, Wolverine's Patch alias tells him in a vision that the scarred Wolverine is his berserker mode and warns him that he is unpredictable and dangerously unrestrained. As Wolverine does not want to die again, he unlocks the cell to his berserker mode. Once free, the scarred Wolverine then promptly stabs Logan in the gut. His red hot claws are used to break free of Iceman, cutting him in half at the waist.Return of Wolverine #3. Marvel Comics. Following his battle with the X-Men, Wolverine wakes up strapped in a hospital bed to learn from Ana that Kitty called a retreat due to Iceman's injuries and Soteira's threat to release the berserker Wolverine upon the city's population. She releases his bonds and tells him that during the intense fighting, his claws were glowing white hot and that even after the X-Men, who are in fact his friends, fled from the battle, he still slaughtered about a third of the city's populace until he collapsed from exhaustion. Zagreus enters from the shadows and fires a restraining device through Wolverine's chest that pins him to the wall while Persephone explains her entire world view, her disappointment with human society, and reveals that Ana and Perron are in fact mind-controlled undead entities under her will as is everyone in the island-city, which she is using as a testbed for her ultimate goal. She states that she is a mutant with the ability to resurrect the dead while imbuing them with her own personality and can create mindless zombies as well as drones that are fully articulate enough to even fool the senses of Wolverine, depending upon her level of concentration. Ana collapses when Persephone releases her control and has Zagreus escort Wolverine to a launch pad where she invites him to her lair so that he may decide for himself to kill her or allow her to carry out her plans for world domination.Return of Wolverine #4. Marvel Comics. Arriving at Persephone's space station, Wolverine is met by her holographic projection. She gives him a guided tour of the facility, once again inviting him to join her in her plans to replace all dead end jobs with zombies. In a flashback, she is shown raising Wolverine out of his grave and taking control of his psyche. She claims however that at some point, his reactivated healing-factor nullified her mind control, thus setting the events seen in the de-extinction labs in motion. He refuses to participate in her schemes and she responds by flooding the room with gas, causing his skin to blister painfully. He uses his claws to break the glass observation window, ejecting him into the vacuum of space. He climbs the outer hull and reenters by cutting open an airlock. Back inside, he introduces himself to staff member Phil, who explains Persephone's entire plan to use orbiting satellites to attack the earth with her zombie rays. Wolverine then runs amok throughout the station, cutting down all of Persephone's guards that stand in his way. He has visions of several memories of himself, each offering tactical advice for the fight at hand, including the berserker who orders him to release him from his cell lest he die in his losing battle with Zagreus. Bloodied and nearly defeated, Wolverine reaches up to unlock all of the cell doors at once, leaving only the berserker still incarcerated. With the bulk of his memories returned to him, he then easily slays Zagreus. Reaching the power core of the station, Persephone pleads with Wolverine to cease his destruction, threatening to haunt him forever. Unimpressed with the notion of yet one more ghost in his life, Wolverine uses his claws to destroy the nuclear reactor with Persephone being apparently killed in the process. He then rides the burning remains of the space station as it enters the earth's atmosphere, crashing in the pacific ocean. He emerges from the water horribly burned and is rescued by a fishing trawler. Sometime later in New York City, Wolverine arrives at the X-Mansion to resume his role with the X-Men.Return of Wolverine #5. Marvel Comics.

He rejected the leadership of Duke Robert Guiscard and rebelled, perhaps as early as 1064, certainly by 1067. Defeated, he went over the Byzantines in 1068. There is some evidence Joscelin was given a command in Greece. In 1071, he led a fleet to relive the Norman siege of Bari but was intercepted and captured. He ended his life in captivity. Through his daughter, name unknown, his descendants continued to rule Molfetta into the next century. Early career The Old French translator of Amatus of Montecassino calls him Gazoline de la Blace. Geoffrey Malaterra calls him Gocelinus de Orencho, which may mean that he belonged to the Hareng family. He has even been identified with a certain Joscelin de Hareng, who prevented a young Robert Guiscard from physically attacking his elder brother, Count Humphrey of Apulia, during a heated argument in the early 1050s. On 26 June 1066 in Molfetta, Joscelin and his son-in-law, Amicus, made a donation to the monastery of the Santissima Trinit√† in Venosa. The charter refers to Joscelin as a count. Besides the port city of Molfetta, he also received from Duke Robert the lordship of Barletta, which had belonged to Count Peter I of Trani until the latter's death (before 1064). Revolt The Anonymous Chronicle of Bari records that in 1064 Leo Perenos, the Byzantine governor of Dyrrhachium across the Adriatic, began luring Norman nobles into Byzantine allegiance with \\"rewards\\". The most prominent among them was Joscelin. According to the Chronicle, he then led a fleet in an engagement with a Norman fleet sent from Calabria (where Duke Robert was at the time), setting fire to a chelandion. This has traditionally been regarded as the beginning of the first revolt against Robert Guiscard's rule, but it has more recently been argued that the Chronicle mis-dates the events of 1067 to 1064. An alternative interpretation sees the events of 1064 as not directly related to the rebellion that broke out three years later. Joscelin was certainly involved in the revolt of 1067‚Äì68, in which his son-in-law joined, as well as Count Geoffrey of Conversano and Abelard, Count Humphre's son and thus Duke Robert's nephew. Joscelin is reported to have given two of his sons to Perenos as hostages for his loyalty in exchange for money to finance the revolt. By early 1068 Duke Robert had defeated the rebels and Joscelin, along with another leader, Roger Toutebove, fled to Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine empire. His son- in-law, however, was pardoned and apparently able to maintain control of Molfetta. In Byzantine service According to Malaterra, Joscelin was a favourite of the Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes \\"because he was resolute in arms and versed in strategy\\". When narrating the events of 1071, Malaterra calls him Joscelin \\"of Corinth\\", suggesting perhaps that he had been given a command in Hellas by the emperor. Later Italian chronicles give him the title duke. In February 1071, Joscelin led a last-ditch effort to relieve the Siege of Bari, which Robert Guiscard had begun in August 1068 after crushing the Apulian rebellion. According to Amatus, Joscelin was carrying lots of gold and other valuables with which to bribe the besiegers. His fleet of twenty ships embarked from Dyrrhachium intending to run the Norman blockade of Bari. Spotted at night by the two lanterns on Joscelin's flagship, it was intercepted by the fleet of Count Roger I of Sicily and defeated in the rare case of a battle at sea fought at night. Joscelin's flagship was captured in the action and another ship was sunk. Amatus records nine vessels captured in total. What was not sunk or captured limped into Bari's harbour. This was the first Norman naval victory in the Mediterranean. According to William of Apulia, \\"the Norman race had up to this point known nothing of naval warfare. But by thus returning victorious they very much enhanced their leader's confidence...\\" Following the defeat of the relief squadron, Bari surrendered in April 1071. According to Geoffrey Malaterra, Joscelin was \\"attired wonderfully in the Greek style\\" at the time of his capture and thus was he paraded before the besieging troops. According to William of Apulia, following his capture \\"Joscelin led an unhappy life shut up in prison for a long time; he went through many travails and his sufferings continued until the end of his life.\\" Notes Sources   * Italo-Normans Norman warriors Byzantine generals People of the Byzantine‚ÄìNorman wars 11th-century Normans 11th-century Byzantine people Byzantine prisoners of war Counts ","title":"Joscelin of Molfetta"},{"id":"58405077","text":"The Late Elongated Hypocotyl gene (LHY), is an oscillating gene found in plants that functions as part of their circadian clock. LHY encodes components of mutually regulatory negative feedback loops with Circadian Clock Associated 1 (CCA1) in which overexpression of either results in dampening of both of their expression. This negative feedback loop affects the rhythmicity of multiple outputs creating a daytime protein complex. LHY was one of the first genes identified in the plant clock, along with TOC1 and CCA1. LHY and CCA1 have similar patterns of expression, which is capable of being induced by light.Lu, S. X. , and S. M., Andronis. \\"CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL Function Synergistically in the Circadian Clock of Arabidopsis\\" Plant Physiology Vol. 150. (2009): 834‚Äì843. Single loss-of- function mutants in both genes result in seemingly identical phenotypes, but LHY cannot fully rescue the rhythm when CCA1 is absent, indicating that they may only be partially functionally redundant. Under constant light conditions, CCA1 and LHY double loss-of-function mutants fail to maintain rhythms in clock-controlled RNAs.Green, RM. \\"Loss of the circadian clock-associated protein 1 in Arabidopsis results in altered clock-regulated gene expression.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Vol. 96. (1999) The circadian clock in plants has completely different components to those in the animal, fungus or bacterial clocks. The plant clock does have a conceptual similarity to the animal clock in that it consists of a series of interlocking transcriptional feedback loops. The genes involved in the clock show their peak expression at a fixed time of day. The peak expression of the CCA1 and LHY genes occurs at dawn, and the peak expression of the TOC1 gene occurs roughly at dusk. CCA1/LHY and TOC1 proteins repress the expression of each others genes. The result is that as CCA1/LHY protein levels start to reduce after dawn, it releases the repression on the TOC1 gene, allowing TOC1 expression and TOC1 protein levels to increase. As TOC1 protein levels increase, it further suppresses the expression of the CCA1 and LHY genes. The opposite of this sequence occurs overnight to re-establish the peak expression of CCA1 and LHY genes at dawn. CCA1 is generally a more significant component of this oscillator. Light induces its transcription, and mRNA levels peak at dawn along with LHY.Kangisser, Shlomit, Esther Yakir, and Rachel M. Green. \\"Proteasomal regulation of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) stability is part of the complex control of CCA1\\" Plant Signaling & Behavior Vol. Volume 8, Issue 3. (2013) CCA1 and LHY associate to inhibit transcription of the Evening Complex (EC) proteins: ELF4, ELF3 and LUX, which suppresses their accumulation until dusk when LHY and CCA1 protein levels are at their lowest. Four primary pseudo-response regulator proteins (PRR9, PRR7, PRR5 and TOC1/PRR1) perform the majority of interactions with other proteins within the circadian oscillator, and another (PRR3) that has limited function. These genes are all paralogs of each other, and all repress the transcription of CCA1 and LHY at various times throughout the day. Plants that have lost function of LHY and CCA1 lose the ability to stably maintain circadian rhythm and other output phenomena. In one study, such plants showed photoperiod- insensitive early flowering under long- day (16 hours of light/ 8 hours of dark) conditions and short day (8 hours of light, 16 hours of dark conditions), and arrhythmicity under constant light conditions.Aihara, Kohei, and Satoshi Naramoto. \\"Increase in vascular pattern complexity caused by mutations in LHY and CCA1 in Arabidopsis thaliana under continuous light\\" Plant Biotechnology Vol. 31. (2014): 43-47 However they retain some circadian function in light/dark cycles, showing that Arabidopsis circadian clock is not completely dependent on CCA1 and LHY activity.Alabadi, David, and Marcelo J. Yanovsky. \\"Critical Role for CCA1 and LHY in Maintaining Circadian Rhythmicity in Arabidopsis\\" Current Biology Vol. 12(9). (2002): 757‚Äì761 Plants with non-functioning LHY and CCA1 show a wavy leaf phenotype in constant light conditions. Mutants also have increased vascular pattern complexity in their leaves, with more areoles, branch points and free ends than wild-type Arabidopsis. The function of LHY was initially demonstrated by a group in the Steve Kay lab, including Andrew Millar.C.

After the family textile business in which he worked suffered in the late 1920s during the Great Depression, he earned his first income with photographs of the frozen Rhine at St. Goar. In 1936 he obtained a Meisterpr√ºfung im Photographenhandwerk (Master Certificate in Photographic Craft), and worked as a portrait and advertising photographer, and after the 1930s started to photograph in colour. In 1942 he married the Cologne-based photographer Ria Dietz. Tr√ºmmerfotografie Hermann Claasen (1946-7) Ruins of St Martin at Cologne old market After the Second World War professional and amateur photographers, German and foreign, took many thousand photographs that together became a genre known as Tr√ºmmerfotografie (English: 'rubble photography' or 'the photography of ruins').BLOKKER, J. M. (2016). Remembering and Experiencing German Cities in Photographic Books after World War II. Paper Cities: Urban Portraits in Photographic Books, 191. Robert Capa and Margaret Bourke-White documented the damage and destruction of Berlin on assignment for American magazines in August 1945 as did and Capa‚Äôs European colleagues Werner Bischof, David ‚ÄòChim‚Äô Seymour and Ernst Haas. Among these, Claasen‚Äôs ‚Äòrubble photographs‚Äô of bombed Cologne are therefore a valuable historical record because, after his studio and his photo archive were destroyed in an attack on May 31, 1942, he started photographing during the conflict despite strict prohibitions against it. His work from 1945/46 was legitimised by the D√ºren chief administrator's documentation of the destruction of D√ºren, J√ºlich and H√ºrtgenwald, which was later published in 1949 in the booklet Verbrannte Erde ('Burnt Earth').

What is distinctive about Claasen‚Äôs photographs of the devastation is his application of the principles of picturesque German photography of before the First World War, inherited from paintings of ruins in the Romantic tradition, and his emphasis on religious monuments and their remaining sculptural ornamentation.

Claasen's 1948 photograph K√∂ln, Kinder an der Barbara- Kaserne (Cologne, children at the Barbara barracks) varied from his typical Tr√ºmmerfotografie in that it featured so many human subjects and placed less emphasis on the ruins, and shows a roundelay of children in front of military barracks that after the war housed homeless families in the parts left standing. It was exhibited with seventeen others of children joining hands for a ‚ÄòRing-a-ring-a-rosie‚Äô, all mounted on a stand that, in form, imitated the circular dance motion of the children in each photograph and forced the audience into the same step. Late career After the war and his documentation of the devastated Rhineland, Claasen returned to commercial work and his portrait of Adenauer was used in election campaigns. An ongoing contributor to Photokina, he kept up with current trends in post-war photography, and also with the developments of modern art that had advanced abroad, participating in many exhibitions.Koenig, T.

In the 1950s and 60s, he produced industrial and portrait photography for the museums of Cologne and for private companies, but by 1970 had to give up his photographic studio due to failing sight.  Legacy  Through the 1980s Claasen held exhibitions of his work in Cologne, D√ºren, Bonn and Brussels. After his death an annual award for Rhineland photographers, the Hermann-Claasen-Preis f√ºr Kreative Fotografie und Medienkunst (Hermann Claasen Award for Creative Photography and Media Arts) was inaugurated in his name in 1987. As a freelance photographer, he worked for many clients, and good examples of mid-century portraits and advertising are part of his estate.

Twitty. It was published in 2017 and is a food memoir. The author combines intensive genealogical and historical research as well as personal accounts to support the argument that the origin of southern cuisine is heavily based in the continent of Africa.The book was the recipient of the 2018 James Beard Foundation Book Award for Writing and Book of the Year. Background Michael W. Twitty is a Jew by choice and notes within The Cooking Gene that the documentation and history found within Jewish cuisine inspired him to write it. The book takes a look at the social ecology surrounding the cuisine traditionally done by African Americans in the southern US. In the book, topics such as genealogy, chattel slavery, sexuality, gender, and spirituality are discussed in addition to foodways. Twitty adds discussions surrounding Soul Food, African American foodways, and Southern Cuisine. Summary The Cooking Gene is about the influence that the enslavement of Africans by European settlers has had on foodways and history of the Old South. The Cooking Gene includes personal narratives, history, recipes, and folk songs. The recipes have African, Native American, and European roots as the author integrates his Jewish faith into African-American cooking. Twitty emphasizes the African flair that has been added to European and Native American ingredients by African American cooks. Additionally, he discusses plants used in cooking that are native to Africa such as sesame, okra, and sorghum. The author discusses how he did not enjoy traditional soul food recipes during his youth but began to accept his African American heritage as he learned to cook. Twitty's experiences growing up led to him to develop an interest in culinary arts. In The Cooking Gene, the author describes the methods that African Americans used to cook on plantations and travels to the south on what the author called the \\"Southern Discomfort Tour\\" to learn more about his family's history and to authentically reproduce meal preparation experiences that former enslaved Africans may have had. Twitty argues that techniques used in African American cooking food have an innate nature and this can be attributed to the supplies Africans and their descendants had available to them during meal preparation. This exploration of the culinary history seeks to raise awareness of diversity of ingredients that African Americans traditionally ate in the South. The Cooking Gene also compares and contrasts Jewish and Black foodways, and discusses followers of Judaism in the south. Jewish and Black culinary traditions and items have mingled with each other both in the south and in northern cities. Twitty talks about his conversion to Judaism and expresses his fondness for Jewish cuisine. Reception The Cooking Gene has received positive reception as it has received praise for both its prose as well as what reviewers saw as unique elements that Twitty ties into the book. The Chicago Tribune commented on the work, calling it \\"honest\\" and \\"lyrical.\\" It has been named as one of NPR‚Äôs Best Books of 2017 and one of Smithsonian Magazine's Ten Best Books About Food in 2017.

The dye is a registered trademark of ibidi GmbH. There are several types and combinations of the dye that can be utilized depending on the cell type, protocol, and purpose of the analysis.  Types  * LifeAct Plasmid * LifeAct mRNA * LifeAct Adenovirus * LifeAct Lentivirus * LifeAct Protein  Chemistry  LifeAct-TagGFP2 being the most widely used dye compared to other LifeAct constructs is composed of the first 17 amino acid from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abp140, an actin-binding protein. The Abp140 is highly conserved among Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other closely related organisms. It is introduced as a dye but is actually a localisation marker for actin. The 17 amino acid fragment of Abp140 was genetically fused to GFP and fluoresces green when it binds the F-actin structures of living and fixed cells, allowing for visualization of cell mechanics under microscopes. Previous experiments involving the analysis of cell mechanics had depended on fluorescently labeled phalloidin and actin GFP fusion proteins obtained from utrophin in Xenopus laevis and ABP120 in Dictyostelium discoideum. However, due to their large protein size, markers such as phalloidin and GFP fusion proteins are limited to cells that can be transfected and tend to compete with their orthologous protein. These localization markers, often referred to as dyes, affect cellular mechanical properties and F-actin structures, thus making these markers unreliable. An alternative to these markers is Life Act- TagGFP2, which is a much smaller protein and does not affect cell mechanics. Cells synthesize LifeAct-TagGFP2 in a short period of time at a cost-effective making it suitable as an in vivo marker.  Applications in biomedical research  LifeAct dyes have been used as a universal marker for F-actin visualization in biomedical research. An experiment conducted by Sawant et al. utilized LifeAct GFP to visualize the migration of control border cells in the ovaries of Drosophila flies, in order to determine how cells move in terms of small and large collectives during development and cancer. The dye that labels F-actin in border cells and adjacent follicle cells allowed for the detailed examination of border cell membranes and protrusions. Studies regarding the degradation of actin cytoskeleton due to aging relied on LifeAct dyes for the analysis of cytoskeletal organization as a function of age. Transgenic lines that expressed the LifeAct dye in various tissues of C. elegans were primarily used for imaging.

In baseball, an opening pitcher, more frequently referred to as an opener, is a pitcher who specializes in getting the first outs in a game, before being replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher. Pitchers employed in the role of opener have usually been relief pitchers by trade. The strategy was frequently employed in Major League Baseball (MLB) by the Tampa Bay Rays during the 2018 season, when it was adopted by other teams as well. Concept and early use By the 1980s, MLB teams had adopted starting rotations consisting of five starting pitchers, with all other pitchers on the active roster serving as relief pitchers. Traditionally, a starter was expected to throw the most innings of any pitcher in a game. Starters typically pitched until they got into trouble or reached a pitch count threshold. Curly Ogden pitched for the Washington Senators in the 1924 World Series. In Game 7 of the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators had their starting pitcher, Curly Ogden, pitch to only two batters and then brought in a left-handed pitcher, with the intent of locking the opposing team into their left-handed lineup. Similarly, in the 1990 National League Championship Series, the Pittsburgh Pirates decided to open the game with right-handed relief pitcher Ted Power before installing the announced starting pitcher, left-hander Zane Smith, in an attempt to get the Cincinnati Reds to change their batting lineup. In 1993, the Oakland Athletics had a poor starting rotation, and manager Tony La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan split their pitchers into platoons, with a core of dedicated relief pitchers. Though the experiment lasted for only six games before the Athletics returned to a traditional starting rotation, Ron Darling, a member of the 1993 Athletics, called it \\"a precursor to all the things that you see today\\". In the 21st century, baseball writers advanced the idea that starting pitchers are less effective against the opposing team's hitters the more times in a game they face them. Dave Fleming, a writer for Bill James Online, wrote in 2009 about a proposed \\"3-3-3 rotation\\" where pitchers would be limited to throwing three innings in a game. Bryan Grosnick, writing for SB Nation's Beyond the Box Score, suggested using an opening pitcher for an inning or two before giving way to a more traditional starting pitcher in a 2013 article. In his 2016 book, Ahead of the Curve, Brian Kenny suggested the possible use of an opening pitcher, noting that the highest scoring inning is typically the first inning, so a team should use a relief pitcher to shut down the top of the opposing team's batting order. 2018 MLB season The Tampa Bay Rays began experimenting with an opener during the 2018 season, first utilizing the strategy on May 19. The first pitcher they chose to deploy as the opener was Sergio Romo, a veteran who has served as a closer. Romo pitched in the role again on May 22 and 23. The Rays returned Romo to their closer role in June, and they continued to use an opener, primarily turning to Ryne Stanek, Diego Castillo and Hunter Wood for the role. The Rays saw their team earned run average (ERA) decrease after beginning to use the strategy. The Rays' openers recorded a 3.97 ERA in a combined 93 innings pitched, which bested the league average ERA of 4.15. During the summer, the Rays also experimented with an opener in their Double-A and Triple-A affiliates. Scott Alexander with the Los Angeles Dodgers In June, the Los Angeles Dodgers used Scott Alexander as an opener due to injuries in their starting rotation. The Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, and Texas Rangers also employed openers in the last month of the 2018 season. In the nine games in which the Athletics used the opener strategy in September (with Liam Hendriks serving as opener in eight of those games), they posted a win-loss record of 4‚Äì5 and a 1.86 ERA. The Athletics also chose to use Hendriks as the opener, unsuccessfully, in the 2018 American League Wild Card Game. In the 2018 National League Championship Series, the Milwaukee Brewers used starter Wade Miley as an opener in Game 5. He pitched to only one batter before being replaced, becoming just the second pitcher in MLB playoff history to start a game and face only one batter. When Farhan Zaidi became general manager of the San Francisco Giants after the 2018 season, he spoke about using an opener to protect Dereck Rodriguez and Andrew Suarez from being overworked. 2019 MLB season Chad Green with the New York Yankees The Tampa Bay Rays continued to use an opener in many of their games, with Ryne Stanek often filling the role. The New York Yankees coped with having three of their starting pitchers on the injured list by using reliever Chad Green as an opener. Green would pitch the first inning or two and then hand over the game to a long reliever. During the 2019 regular season, Green opened 15 games for the Yankees; the Yankees won 11 of the games that he started. The Los Angeles Angels pitched a no-hitter using an opener, with Taylor Cole working the first two innings and F√©lix Pe√±a the last seven in their 13‚Äì0 no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners on July 12. Advantages One advantage of the strategy is that the opener, who is often a hard-throwing specialist, can be called in to face the most dangerous hitters, who are usually near the top of the batting order, the first time they come to bat. If the opener is successful, the job of the next pitcher is easier since they will start with less-dangerous hitters. The strategy also throws off the timing of the top-of-the-order hitters, who are not used to seeing different pitchers each time they come to bat, and allows the usual starting pitcher to face the top of the lineup two times rather than three. From a financial perspective, the strategy allows teams to make more use of relief pitchers who are still under low-paying contracts, potentially reducing the salaries paid to starting pitchers because the latter are used less.
