H. Kress & Co. was the trading name of a chain of \\"five and dime\\" retail department stores in the United States of America, established by Samuel Henry Kress, which operated from 1896 to 1981. In the first half of the 20th century, there were Kress stores with ornamented architecture on \\"Main Street\\" in hundreds of cities and towns.

The Kress Foundation In the 1920s and 1930s, Kress sold a house label of phonograph records under the Romeo trademark. He died in 1955. The company's exclusion of African Americans from its lunch counters made Kress a target for civil rights protests during the 1960 lunch counter sit-ins, along with Woolworth's, Rexall and other national chains.Nashville Student Movement (1960-1964).

The series was created by Junichi Sato, who also directed the first season, and written by Reiko Yoshida. Kaleido Star: New Wings was directed by Yoshimasa Hiraike. Kaleido Star follows Sora Naegino, a young Japanese girl, who travels to the United States to fulfill her dream of performing at the world-famous Kaleido Stage. Three original video animations have been produced, as well as a manga series and a novel.  Plot  = First Season = Sora Naegino is a young Japanese girl with great acrobatic talent who travels to Los Angeles, California in hopes of auditioning for the Kaleido Stage, a world-famous circus which has mesmerized her since childhood. However, she runs into difficulties as soon as she arrives. She gets lost on her way to the Stage, is leered at by a mysterious stranger, and has her bag stolen by a thief. Employing her acrobatic skills, Sora chases down the criminal. A kind police officer gives her a ride to Kaleido Stage only to discover she had missed her audition, an event upon which her idol, Layla Hamilton, advises her to return to Japan. However, after a performer is injured, the owner of the circus, Kalos offers her a chance to perform. Sora, humiliated by her failed efforts decides to return to Japan. Kalos, having seen her earlier chase, reconsiders and informs Layla that Sora's performance will eventually be the main act at the circus, earning her reluctant respect. The other members of Kaleido Stage, particularly Layla, are dissatisfied with Sora. With the help of stage manager Ken Robbins, the performers Mia Guillem and Anna Heart, young Marion Begnini, as well as a lot of hard work and determination, Sora begins to earn the respect of those around her. Her personality eventually earns the respect of the performers as well as several increasingly major roles in the productions. She also befriends Layla over time. However, Layla's father pressures her to leave and insiders plan to take over and shut down Kaleido Stage. Sora relies on her winning personality, hard work and close friendships to keep the stage afloat. = New Wings = In the second season, Sora returns to the stage after attempting the Legendary Great Maneuver with Layla. This leaves Layla's shoulder injured and unable to perform. The absence of her co-star, having retired to further a career in Broadway productions, prompts a slight decline of the Kaleido Stage. Because of this Kalos brings in a new recruit, Leon Oswald (a lofty trapeze artist). It seems at first that Leon is reminded very much of someone due to Sora's presence, and at times this causes him to either be really rude or really sweet to Sora. Despite this, however, Leon disapproves Sora as worthy of being on the stage with him. This leads to the most talented of the new Kaleido Stage recruits, the Chinese-American May Wong (who is also an ex-figure skater) to question and challenge Sora's position as Leon's partner and star of the show. After a very ugly incident, however, May begins to question herself and her goals. Sora's first goal in the season is to attend the circus festival in Paris, but the competitors will do anything to attain the title of 'festival winner': betray, deceive, or even attack their opposers. The atmosphere and attitude this creates does not bode kindly to Sora's carefree, optimistic, ultra-idealistic outlook. It, in turn, causes her to withdraw from the competition in the middle of her act (or the Angel Act) with the redeemed Yuri Killian, leaving her friends, family and Layla confused and otherwise disappointed with Sora. Most of the season concentrates on Sora finding, questioning, and pursuing new dreams. After many trials and rejections, Sora eventually aims to become a \\"True Kaleido Star\\" while creating a fun, conflict-free stage, the complete opposite of what she experiences at the festival in Paris. = The Amazing Princess Without a Smile = The first OVA looks at a new production in the works that follows the Kaleido Stage's success with Swan Lake, about a female princess that is unable to smile and a jester of hers that is hoping to bring her smile back. The idea for the production came to Mia from a painting that featured a character that looked very similar to Rosetta and a jester in the background that looked surprisingly like Fool (the stage spirit that can be seen only by very talented students). Rosetta is assigned the lead role as the princess. Unfortunately, despite the likeliness of her being able to comprehend the role fully as she herself never carried a smile when she first came to Kaleido Stage, she has difficulties acting out the part and leaves the rehearsals mid- way frustrated. Will Rosetta be able to play the role right? What ties does Fool have with the painting of the princess and the jester? = Legend of Phoenix ~Layla Hamilton Monogatari~ = Layla and Sora are about to launch different interpretations of the same show \\"Legend of Phoenix\\" on opposite coasts. Layla is preparing at the Broadway but is dissatisfied with her performance. She feels that she cannot perform the role properly if she is not truly reborn as a new Layla Hamilton. In a desperate attempt to be reborn, Layla runs off on a solo bicycle trip to upstate New York in hopes of rediscovering herself. Meanwhile, Sora is also attempting to find her own Phoenix, but when she learns of Layla's disappearance she, Ken and May run off to New York to find the former Kaleido Star who at that instant was on a bike journey with no set destination. Layla meets various strangers and reminisces memories of her childhood along the way as she thinks of how she can change herself. But while she tries to find a new self, she spends her entire time alone thinking about Sora until she comes to realize just how much Sora has been a muse to her. Once she realizes that, she is reborn. The nature of this revelation, though speculated in different ways by various fans, is up to interpretation. During the end credits, we are shown two different Phoenixes. = Good da yo! Goood!! = Good da yo! Goood!! is a 22 minutes OVA that is rendered by computer graphics. All of the characters are presented super deformed. The OVA is split up into three parts. The first part is a lesson in Chinese cooking presented by May Wong; the dish that is presented is mapo doufu. The second part is a lesson on how to use the diabolo by Rosetta Passel. The final part is a lesson in seal lingo presented by Marion and Jonathan to Sora.

Reception  Kaleido Star was generally well received by critics, with the majority of acclaim paid to the first season. = Season 1 = In a review of the first Volume, Anime News Network called the series \\"heartwarming fluff without too many sugar calories\\" and praised the Japanese voice cast for stellar performances, with particular emphasis on Ryo Hirohashi and Takehito Koyasu. Anime On DVD also noted Koyasu's performance, the quality of the animation in the performance scenes, and the fulfilling climax of the final episode. Mike Lewis of Underland Online noted Kaleido Star as being \\"...an extraordinary series is in a class all its own.\\" = Season 2 = Despite being put off by the recap episodes, Anime News Network positively reviewed the first Volume of Kaleido Star: New Wings. While critiquing the story as \\"straight from the shōjo drama playbook,\\" the review held praise for the visuals, stating that \\"the best thing about Kaleido Star is, far and away, the amazing animation and production values. The circus scenes are wildly original and sometimes breathtaking; the animation quality hasn't dipped at all in the second season.\\" Cynthia Martinez also won notice for developing her performance as Sora. Anime Advanced also looked at the first volume and praised it highly, noting that \\"Kaleido Star gets my highest possible recommendation. This is a show that dreams are made of.\\" Summing up the series, Chris Beveridge of Anime On DVD said that \\"Kaleido Star has been a great series overall with a somewhat weak second season that really took its time to find its own voice,\\" but that \\"it's still a series that's very easy to recommend on a whole and one that is very much worth showing to a younger audience.\\" ActiveAnime's Holly Ellingwood commented that \\"The finale is climatic and fulfilling.\\" and summarized the series as being \\"An anime that is a pure joy to watch. Exhilarating, Kaleido Star is a stirring series that is both inspirational and remarkable.\\" = Extra Stage = Anime On DVD proclaimed the OVA to be \\"a beautiful piece of work and the best way to close out things for a while as it is much more oriented on the comedy and the lighter side of the characters... It's a great little self-contained story that plays strong in a similar fashion to the last episode of the series but without quite so much angst and hardship associated with it.

Taidō has its roots in traditional Okinawan karate. Feeling that the martial arts, particularly karate, were not adapting to meet the needs of a changing world, Shukumine first developed a style of karate called Genseiryū around 1950. Founding Seiken Shukumine, the founder of Taidō, sought to overcome limitations of karate by developing the more flexible Taidō. Eventually, Seiken Shukumine became convinced that the limitations of karate lay in its linear mode of training. He considered how to make the defense more flexible and universal and introduced the new art as \\"Taidō\\". Taidō's techniques offered many innovations: the inclusion of spinning and twisting movements, gymnastic maneuvers, speedy and effective footwork, and a changing body angle. Taidō's purpose was, and continues to be, the application of scientific methodology and traditional values to the evolution of the martial arts. According to its creator, Taidō's ultimate aim is to equip its practitioners to function at a high level in society.Shukumine 1988 Five principles of Taidō *Keep your mind as clear and calm as the polished surface of a mirror. This way you will see to the heart of things. Having the right state of mind will help you avoid confusion. *Be composed. Body and mind should be as one. Bear yourself correctly and you need never fear insult. *Invigorate your spirit from the source of energy deep in your abdomen. With the right spirit you will never fear combat. *In every action, follow the correct precepts you have been taught. By doing so you cannot act wrongly. *Be adaptable in your techniques and maintain freedom of physical movement. The right technique will prevent you from being dominated. Five types of body movements Taidō classifies attack and defense techniques into five categories of body movement:Shukumine 1988 *Sen - Vertical spinning movement *Un - Ascending and descending wave-like movement *Hen - Falling movement characterized by changing the body's axis *Nen - Horizontal spinning movement *Ten - Rolling and tumbling movement These movements are combined with punches, kicks, and other techniques. The last category, Ten, includes acrobatic movements, for instance back-flips, which makes Taidō spectacular to watch. Taidō has a special kind of foot-work, which is called unsoku, as well as non-stepping (acrobatic) locomotion, called unshin. Competition Competitions in Taidō include Jissen (sparring), Hokei (which is similar to kata), and Tenkai, which is a made-up fight, where one \\"hero\\" defeats five opponents during the last part of a 30-second bout. In Tenkai the judges give points to the competing teams in a similar manner as is done in for instance figure skating. = Jissen (Sparring) = Taido is a semi contact sport. A taido match is won the competitor, who is either the first to score a full point (ippon), or has more points when the time ends. A good hit must have proper and legal technique, timing, target, contact and kiai (a shout accompanying the strike). The head is not a valid target. Also, hits must not knock out the other person, but simply indicate the weak point in the opponent's defence. A kick or a punch is worthy of ippon when it is performed from proper taido movement, has control, lands on the opponent ’s torso and is finally followed by and immediate retraction ad return to one's original position. Failing these, an imperfect hit can however merit a half point (wazari) or a quarter point (yuko). Warnings are given for improper and bad movement, poor basic stance, wrong target area for strikes or physical damage to the opponent. Typical of a taido match is the constant movement, used for maintaining good distance to the opponent and gaining a feasible offensive position. Turning and twisting moves, acrobatics and shifts in body axes are an integral part of a taido match. There are no weight classes in taido, because a taidoka must be able to fight against all and any kinds of opponents = Hokei = Movements sets are an inherent part of training in martial arts, and are made up of various basic techniques. They function as a powerful form of basic training, developing both technique, strength, speed and body control. The name for taido's movement sets is hokei. There are 10 basic hokeis in taido. All of these sets have a basic, prearranged shape and form, but a competitor may change the rhythm and breathing of the hokei as long as the essence of the hokei remains unchanged. A competitor may also receive extra points from the referees, if the difficulty of the hokei is heightened via addition of e.g. somersaults or other moves, not found in the basic version. The movement sets do not exist only for basic techniques, however, but also for practising combinations and training fighting against imaginary foes. Thus a good form will contain, in addition to good technique, changes in rhythm and features of offence and defence, such as focusing one's eyes on the imagined enemy, movement and production of power. Hokei is an official competition in taido, all the way up to European and World Championship level. Those who have trained taido for a longer time will also practise hokeis for special techniques and breathing. In all hokeis the result of the match will be determined by three judges, all of whom announce via a raised flag which of the participants won. = Dantai jissen = Dantai jissen, or team sparring, is fought between two teams of five competitors each. Women may have 3-person teams. Matches are played out individually, and the team to accumulate more victories wins. In dantai jissen the rules and scoring is similar to individual jissen, so a full point (ippon), half point (wazari) and quarter point (yuko) are available, but in addition a single match can also end in a draw, hikiwake. A kick or a punch is worthy of ippon when it is performed from proper Taido movement, has control, lands on the opponent ’s torso and is finally followed by and immediate retraction ad return to one’s original fighting position. A perfect technique should also include a shout (kiai). Each team has a team leader. The task of this leader is to draw up the team’s tactics, and based on this to choose the appropriate fighter for each round. Team training adds variety to one’s regular training. Competing together truly is a part of the art’s appeal. The team to win more individual bouts wins the game. = Dantai hokei = Not many may consider Taido a team sport, although training together is a key part of the art’s appeal. Team hokei is a movement set performed by five competitors at the same time, in as unison as possible. The intensive training will forge the team a strong and united one. Competitors attempt to maintain their formation from the very beginning as coherently as possible. The movement set must remain within the limits of the area. The ultimate aim of the team is a performance in perfect unison. The rhythm and breathing in the set can be altered. Also, additional points can be awarded for more difficult techniques not found in the original basic set, such as somersaults. Grading in team hokei involves, amongst other things, the maintaining of the formation, simultaneousness of the techniques and creativity. Also important are the general impression and the harmony of the set. All of the referees will score the whole hokei, and individual performances within will not be scored separately. The team with the highest score wins. In a tie situation, the head judge’s points will determine the winner. Team training adds variety to one’s regular training. It also develops team spirit amongst the various trainers. = Tenkai = Tenkai is a prearranged and choreographed, from 25 to 30 seconds long “fight”, in which five persons (wakiyaku) will attack a single central “hero” fighter (shuyaku). In tenkai both creativity and three-dimensionality are best brought to the stage. The group will design the fight together, which only adds to the team spirit. The timing of the techniques is crucial for the entire fight, and thus merit careful design and much practice. Tenkai thus gives one the opportunity to fully employ the large technique and movement repertoire in taido and also to utilize moves rarely seen in a normal match. The developer of taido created these team sports to supplement the single ones, since he wanted to emphasize interactivity and sociability amongst the practitioners. The criteria for points in tenkai include i.a. moving, usage of distance and space, three- dimensionality in both offence and defence, the difficulty of the techniques and the realism and feasibility of the attacks. The central “hero’s” (shuyaku) performance will also be graded with regards to the moves used to finish the tenkai and five attackers. Altogether five judges will be evaluating the activities of the contestants. Furthermore, the main judge will observe the central man and the performance as a whole. The central man must win all the five attackers each at a time. Should the total time either exceed or fall short of the parameters, points will be deducted. Miscellaneous information Taidō is practiced in Japan, Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and the United States. Taidō is unrelated to Shintaido. Taidō is unrelated to Taido (read by some as 'futoudo').

The underlying concept is that one has a legal duty to use reasonable care to avoid causing emotional distress to another individual. If one fails in this duty and unreasonably causes emotional distress to another person, that actor will be liable for monetary damages to the injured individual. The tort is to be contrasted with intentional infliction of emotional distress in that there is no need to prove intent to inflict distress. That is, an accidental infliction, if negligent, is sufficient to support a cause of action. History NIED began to develop in the late nineteenth century, but only in a very limited form, in the sense that plaintiffs could recover for consequential emotional distress as a component of damages when a defendant negligently inflicted physical harm upon them. By 1908, most industrial U.S. states had adopted the \\"physical impact\\" form of NIED. However, NIED started developing into its more mature and more controversial form in the mid-20th century, as the new machines of the Second Industrial Revolution flooded the legal system with all kinds of previously unimaginable complex factual scenarios. Courts began to allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress resulting from negligent physical injuries to not only themselves, but other persons with whom they had a special relationship, like a relative. The first step, then, was to remove the requirement of physical injury to the actual plaintiff while keeping the requirement of physical injury to someone. In the 1968 landmark decision of Dillon v. Legg, the Supreme Court of California was the first court to allow recovery for emotional distress aloneeven in the absence of any physical injury to the plaintiffin the particular situation where the plaintiff simply witnessed the death of a close relative at a distance, and was not within the \\"zone of danger\\" where the relative was killed.See Dillon v. Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968). A 2007 statistical study commissioned by the Court found that Dillon was the most persuasive decision published by the Court between 1940 and 2005; Dillon has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision.Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, \\" Followed Rates\\" and Leading State Cases, 1940-2005, 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 683, 694(2007). The next step after Dillon was to make optional the element of another person (so that the injury could be to anything where it would be reasonably foreseeable that such injury would cause some person emotional distress). The first such case was Rodrigues v. State,52 Haw. 156, 472 P.2d 509 (1970). in which the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that plaintiffs could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of negligently caused flood damage to their home. This is generally considered to be the true birth of NIED as a separate tort. Twelve years after Dillon, California expanded NIED again, by holding that a relative could recover even where the underlying physical injury was de minimis (unnecessary medications and medical tests) if the outcome was foreseeable (the breakup of the plaintiffs' marriage as a result of the defendants' negligent and incorrect diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease).See Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, 27 Cal. 3d 916 (1980). In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time recognized NIED as part of federal common law, by holding that railroad workers could pursue NIED claims against their employers under the Federal Employers Liability Act.Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, . The Court recognized only the pre-Dillon form of NIED, though, in that the plaintiff had to be within a zone of danger to recover in the absence of physical injury. In 1999, Hawaii took NIED even further by expressly holding that \\"damages may be based solely upon serious emotional distress, even absent proof of a predicate physical injury.\\"Roes v. FHP, Inc., 91 Haw. 470, 985 P.2d 661 (1999). Criticism It is generally disfavored by most states because it appears to have no definable parameters and because so many potential claims can be made under it. The situations that would give rise to such a claim are difficult to define. Because of this substantial uncertainty, most legal theorists find the theory to be unworkable in practice. A corollary of this critique is that the tort runs the risk (in the bystander NIED context) of overcompensating plaintiffs for distress which would have occurred anyway regardless of the cause of death of the decedent. In a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of California, which severely limited the availability of bystander NIED, Associate Justice David Eagleson wrote in Thing v. La Chusa, 48 Cal. 3d 644 (1989): An additional criticism of the tort is that it leads to abuse of liability insurance coverage. Most liability insurance policies provide for coverage of negligently inflicted injuries but exclude coverage of intentionally inflicted injuries. If a victim is intentionally injured by a person, many theorists perceive that the victim will tend to recast the claim as being one for negligence in order to fall within the coverage of the insurance policy. The Texas case of Boyles v. Kerr, 855 S.W.2d 593 (Tex. 1993) is illustrative. In this case, the defendant secretly videotaped himself engaging in sexual activities with the plaintiff. The defendant then showed this videotape to numerous individuals and caused severe distress to the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant, asserting a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Texas observed that the facts did not support a claim of negligence. Rather, the Court noted, the facts clearly supported a claim of an intentional injury by the defendant and it was evident that the claim had been cast as \\"negligence\\" solely to obtain insurance coverage. The Court then went on to hold that Texas did not recognize a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Jurisdictions that have rejected the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress do not forbid the recovery of damages for mental injuries. Instead, these jurisdictions usually allow recovery for emotional distress where such distress: # is inflicted intentionally (i.e., intentional infliction of emotional distress) # is directly associated with a physical injury negligently inflicted upon a victim (e.g., emotional distress resulting from a loss of limb or disfigurement of the face) # is caused by defamation and libel; # stems from witnessing a gruesome accident as a bystander # is the product of some misconduct universally recognized as causing emotional distress such as mishandling a loved one’s corpse or failing to deliver a death notice in a timely manner.

It consists of two Sun-like yellow dwarf stars, 16 Cygni A and 16 Cygni B, together with a red dwarf, 16 Cygni C. In 1996 an extrasolar planet was discovered in an eccentric orbit around 16 Cygni B. Distance The parallax of the two brightest stars were measured as part of the Hipparcos astrometry mission. This yielded a parallax of 47.44 milliarcseconds for 16 Cygni A and 47.14 milliarcseconds for 16 Cygni B. Since the two components are associated, it is reasonable to assume they lie at the same distance, so the different parallaxes are a result of experimental error (indeed, when the associated parallax errors are taken into account, the ranges of the parallaxes overlap). Using the parallax of the A component, the distance is 21.1 parsecs. The parallax of the B component corresponds to a distance of 21.2 parsecs. Stellar components 16 Cygni in optical light 16 Cygni is a hierarchical triple system. Stars A and C form a close binary with a projected separation of 73 AU. The orbital elements of the A–C binary are currently unknown. At a distance of 860 AU from A is a third component designated 16 Cygni B. The orbit of B relative to the A–C pair was determined in 1999 and not updated since (as of June 2007): plausible orbits range in period from 18,200 to 1.3 million years, with a semimajor axis ranging from 877 to 15,180 AU. In addition B orbits between 100 and 160 degrees inclination, that is against the A–C pole such that 90 degrees would be ecliptical. Both 16 Cygni A and 16 Cygni B are yellow dwarf stars similar to the Sun. Their spectral types have been given as G1.5V and G3V, with A being a little hotter than the Sun, and B somewhat cooler. The system was within the field of view of the original mission of the Kepler spacecraft, which collected extremely precise photometric data of the stars. From these measurements, asteroseismology models have calculated precise masses of 1.08 and 1.04 times the solar mass for 16 Cygni A and 16 Cygni B respectively, and independent ages of around 7 billion years for each star. The system has also been observed through interferometry, which allowed the determination of the angular diameter of each star. The angular diameters together with the asteroseismology models were used to calculate radii of 1.229 and 1.116 times the solar radius for components A and B respectively. =Abundances= Despite having the same age and presumably the same primordial composition, observations show a small difference in the metallicity of the two 16 Cygni stars. The primary star has an iron abundance of 1.26 times the solar value, compared to 1.13 for the secondary star. A similar trend has been found for all other metals, with the primary component having an average of 10% more metals than B. One possibility is that this difference is linked to the planet 16 Cygni Bb, since its formation may have removed metals from the protoplanetary disk around 16 Cygni B. However, another study found no difference in heavy element abundances between 16 Cygni A and B. Another chemical peculiarity between the stars is in their lithium abundance. Measurements of the lithium abundance in the system show a 4 times higher abundance in component A than in 16 Cygni B. Compared to the Sun, 16 Cygni A has 1.66 as much lithium, while 16 Cygni B has only 0.35. It has been hypothesized that the accretion of about 1 Earth mass of metals by 16 Cygni B soon after the system's formation may have destroyed the lithium in the star's atmosphere. Another proposed scenario is the engulfment of a Jupiter-mass planet by 16 Cygni A, which increased the amount of lithium in the star's outer atmosphere. Planetary system In 1996 an extrasolar planet in an eccentric orbit was announced around the star 16 Cygni B. The discovery by the radial velocity method was made from independent observations from the McDonald Observatory and Lick Observatory. The planet's orbit takes 799.5 days to complete, with a semimajor axis of 1.69 AU. It has a very high eccentricity of 0.69, which might be the result of gravitational perturbations from 16 Cygni A. In particular, simulations show the planet's eccentricity oscillates between low and high values in timescales of tens of millions of years. Like the majority of extrasolar planets detectable from Earth, 16 Cygni Bb was deduced from the radial velocity of its parent star. At the time that only gave a lower limit on the mass: in this case, about 1.68 times that of Jupiter. In 2012, two astronomers, E. Plavalova and N.A. Solovaya, showed that the stable orbit would demand about 2.38 Jupiter masses, such that its orbit was inclined at either 45° or 135°. The eccentric orbit and mass of 16 Cygni Bb makes it extremely unlikely that a terrestrial sized planet will be found orbiting within the star's habitable zone. For the 16 Cyg B system, only particles inside approximately 0.3 AU remained stable within a million years of formation, leaving open the possibility of short-period planets. For them, observation rules out any such planet of over a Neptune mass. There was a METI message sent to the 16 Cygni system. It was transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar—the 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 1; it was sent on May 24, 1999, and it will reach 16 Cygni in November 2069. http://www.cplire.ru/rus/ra&sr;/VAK-2004.html See also * 61 Cygni * 30 Arietis * 83 Leonis * 54 Piscium * HD 20782 * HD 80606 * HD 89744 * HD 222582 References External links  * Triple star systems BD+50 2847 and BD+50 2848 Cygnus (constellation) Cygni, 16 G-type main-sequence stars 0765.1 186408 and 186427 096895 and 096901 7503 and 7504 3 Planetary systems with one confirmed planet ","title":"16 Cygni"},{"id":"1215630","text":"Capitol Technology University (formerly Capitol College) is a private university in South Laurel, Maryland near Washington, DC.

This facility remained at the corner of 16th Street NW and Park Road in Washington, D.C. for 30 years. In 1946, following World War II, the Institute was accredited by the Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD), which is now ABET, Inc. In 1964, it sold its correspondence school division (which comprised 20% of its business) and the Capitol Radio Engineering Institute name, to McGraw-Hill Continuing Education Center. The residential school took the name Capitol Institute of Technology. =Capitol Institute of Technology= In 1964, the Institute changed its name to the Capitol Institute of Technology to reflect its expansion during the 1950s. That same year, it sold its correspondence school division, which comprised 20% of its business, to McGraw-Hill Education. Shortly thereafter, in 1966, the District of Columbia licensed the Institute to award Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering technology. Anticipating the need for more space, the Institute decided to move to a leased facility in Kensington, Maryland, in 1969, which opened in January 1970. Six years later, in 1976, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) awarded full accreditation to the Institute.Middle States Commission on Higher Education: Institution Directory After receiving regional accreditation, the Institute started to receive Federal and State grants for the purchase and construction of a new campus at the site of the former Beltsville Speedway (a.k.a.

In 1986, Telecommunications Hall and the 340-seat Avrum Gudelsky Memorial Auditorium were completed. =Capitol College= A year later, in 1987, the Board of Trustees approved an extensive Five-Point Plan. This plan involved changing the school's name to Capitol College, developing new curricula in electrical engineering and telecommunications, creating student housing on campus, and moving from a quarter system to a semester system. In January 1989, six apartment-style residence halls were completed, named after various inventors: Bell, De Forest, Edison, Franklin, Morse, and Steinmetz. In August 1990, the Graduate School was created to offer the College's first Master's degrees in systems management, similar to a degree offered at the time by the U.S.C. Institute of Safety and Systems Management.. Over the following seven years, the College expanded its graduate degree offerings, partnered with NASA to offer preparatory summer courses in engineering for minority students, developed a Distance Learning Center, and opened the renovated Puente Library, also housing the McGowan Center for Innovative Teaching. In 1997, the College offered its first courses online over the Internet. Since then, new undergraduate and graduate programs have been introduced, the Space Operations Institute was established and expanded, the McGowan Academic Center was constructed, and enrollment has increased.

The community includes Bronaber. General information During the Second World War, the War Office used a site near Trawsfynydd for training exercises. Its continued use for training exercises following the war was the subject of protest by Plaid Cymru, which also challenged the UK government's continued military conscription in peace time. Trawsfynydd used to be served by a section of the Great Western Railway branch line, which ran from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog. To the north of the station, the army built its own station to serve the large camp nearby.(camp detail) Today Trawsfynydd railway station is a private home. (pictures). The line closed to all traffic in 1961, and the trackbed at the Bala end was subsequently severed by the Llyn Celyn reservoir, but the section between Blaenau and Trawsfynydd Power Station reopened in 1964 for nuclear flask traffic. Access from the Bala end being no longer possible, a new section of track – the so-called \\"Trawsfynydd Link\\" – was constructed to link the previously separate ex-GWR and ex-LNWR stations in Blaenau Ffestiniog. It finally closed in 1998, although the track remains in situ.

Llyn Trawsfynydd, and power stations The village is close to Llyn Trawsfynydd, a large man-made reservoir, which was originally built between 1924 and 1928 to supply water for Maentwrog hydro- electric power station. The original flooding of the area in the 1920s to create the lake involved the drowning of some two dozen properties, some of historical significance, but there was little objection at the time. The new power station was regarded as a good thing, and indeed on its completion was capable of supplying the whole of North Wales' electricity needs. Llyn Trawsfynydd footbridge However, there was certain objection to the loss of rights of way across the former land, necessitating long detours round the new lake. In response to this, a small road was built along its western shore, and a footbridge (still standing) across the narrowest part of the lake. The lake was subsequently also used to supply cooling water to the twin reactor Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, which was used for the commercial generation of electricity for the UK national grid. Four dams were built to create the lake, one of these being subsequently rebuilt after construction of the nuclear power plant. Whereas previously the Maentwrog power station had access to all of the water in the lake, the needs of the nuclear plant dictated that from then on, the hydro plant should only use the top five feet of water.  Hedd Wyn  Trawsfynydd was the home of the Welsh bard Hedd Wyn who died during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, six weeks before his poem won the Bard's Chair at that year's National Eisteddfod. It was sent to his parents in the village draped in a black cloth. Y Gadair Ddu (The Black Chair) is now on display at his home farm Yr Ysgwrn. A statue of him by L. S.

The original Titanium Man first appeared in Tales of Suspense #68 (Sept 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. Fictional character biography =Boris Bullski= Boris Bullski was born in Makiivka, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. According to the Black Widow, he was a KGB-member when he was a young man, and she was his combat instructor for a time. An ambitious official of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Bullski was demoted after displeasing his superiors. While working as an administrator of a Siberian labor camp, he commissioned the imprisoned scientists at the camp to build a suit of armor using the lab of Anton Vanko, the creator of the original Crimson Dynamo armor. Seeking to win back the Party's favor, Bullski conceived the idea of winning a propaganda victory against the West by defeating the American superhero Iron Man. He assigned the scientists to create a powerful suit of titanium armor based on Iron Man's technology, though the inferior resources available to the scientists meant that the armor was twice the size of Iron Man's. Bullski received permission to issue his challenge and Iron Man accepted, defeating Titanium Man in a battle before a worldwide television audience. Undaunted, Bullski prepared for a rematch by having the suit redesigned and undergoing medical treatments that increased both his size and strength. Traveling to the United States, Bullski fought Iron Man in the skies above Washington, D.C. but was defeated. Withdrawing for retrieval by a Soviet submarine, he discovered that he had been abandoned on orders from Moscow. After working for the Vietnamese Communist scientist Half-Face (who increased his power yet again) for a while, he returned to the service of the Government of the Soviet Union, and was dispatched to the United States to retrieve the third Crimson Dynamo. Finding the Dynamo at Cord Industries, a three-way battle between Titanium Man, Crimson Dynamo, and Iron Man began, during which Titanium Man killed Janice Cord with an electronic beam. Enraged, Iron Man soundly defeated Titanium Man, and left him in the murky depths of the Hudson River. After the defeat, the two disgraced Soviet agents fled to Communist- controlled Vietnam, where they joined with Radioactive Man to form the Titanic Three. Though Bullski enjoyed working as a sanctioned agent once again, he longed to return to the Soviet Union, and devised a new plan to win his superiors' favor. Adopting the alias of \\"The Other\\", he dispatched another former Soviet agent, the Unicorn, to destroy Iron Man. When the Unicorn failed, the Titanium Man went to destroy Iron Man himself, only to fail once more. Despite his failures, Bullski was in favor with the Soviet government once more, and returned to the United States on a mission for the KGB. By threatening the parents of a Soviet defector named Sergei, he forced the man to design technologically advanced armored suits that could be transformed into small card-like objects. Posing as \\"the Commander\\", Bullski used the suits to equip members of the Green Liberation Front (G.L.F.), an organization of disaffected Vietnam War veterans who felt ignored by their country. With the suits, the G.L.F. robbed a New York City bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York;Thor vol. 1 #357 (July 1985) though the members believed that they were simply acting as thieves, Bullski used the robberies as a cover for implanting a computer virus that would destroy American financial records, causing chaos in the economy of the United States. Beta Ray Bill and Sif opposed the G.L.F. and the Commander, but when Sergei discovered that his parents were dead he exposed Bullski's true identity and the angry members of the G.L.F. turned on the Titanium Man. Teleporting away, he rematerialized in card form, which Sergei then simply tore and threw away.Thor vol. 1 #358 (August 1985) Sometime later, the new Crimson Dynamo was sent to the United States by the Soviet government to retrieve the remnants for reintegration.Soviet Super Soldiers #1 (Nov. 1992) The G.L.F. discovered the Crimson Dynamo's mission and attacked him, forcing him to seek assistance by reactivating the Titanium Man, who due to the incomplete nature of his reassembly was still missing body parts. Enraged, Bullski slaughtered the members of the G.L.F., and was only stopped when the Dynamo lured him over the Atlantic Ocean and returned him to card form. Bullski was later restored and continued to serve as Titanium Man, as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers and later Remont-4, but felt increasingly despondent as the Soviet Union declined. After an attack on a Stark Enterprises factory in Russia he was believed killed while battling Tony Stark, who was wearing Crimson Dynamo armor that was being controlled by Colonel General Valentin Shatalov, a former friend of Bullski. Sometime later, during a space mission to destroy an enormous asteroid that threatened to impact on Earth, a Titanium Man, stated his name was Andy Stockwell (revealed to be an alias to Bullski), and had never had a connection with the USSR. However, moments later it was revealed he was actually a member of \\"The Hammer\\", an international network of communist sleeper cells who wanted to destroy the United States. He was lost in space, but being relatively close to Earth, may have returned under his own power. Now a mercenary, Bullski was hired by Tony Stark to fake an attack on Congress trying to show reasons to stop the superhuman registration act. He battled Spider-Man there and made a withdrawal after Spidey damaged his helmet with his cybernetic claws, but not without saying to a camera in Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit a planned talk which Stark used in the Congress in rejection of the SRA. The Titanium Man reappeared, this time in Russia, as a member of the rogue Soviet super-rebel group called Remont Six. He was knocked out by Darkstar, but was apparently not captured.Hulk: Winter Guard Some time later Titanium Man was seen being beaten down by the Protector. The identity of this Titanium Man or the circumstances of the battle remain undisclosed, but he is presumably Bullski, because he was wearing that version of the armor.The Avengers vol. 4 #2 During Doctor Octopus's latest scheme, Octavius contacted the Titanium Man as one of several villains to assist in his plans after two of the Sinister Six were defeated, but this backfired when the Titanium Man contacted the Black Widow to warn her about the villain's current schemes, defining himself as a Russian patriot rather than an American villain, and obeying Spider-Man's call to rally other heroes against his foe.Amazing Spider-Man #685 When Titanium Man entered one of Doctor Octopus' facilities, he was defeated by Scorpion despite his best efforts.Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1 =Kondrati Topolov= The second version was Kondrati Topolov, the mutant formerly known as Gremlin,Iron Man Manual Mark 3 and served with the Soviet-era superhero group, the Soviet Super-Soldiers. He was killed in combat with Iron Man during the first \\"Armor Wars\\" when the titanium in the suit exceeded its combustible temperature. =Third version= The third version's identity is the subject of some controversy. The first time this figure manifested itself, he attacked Stark Enterprises and Iron Man directly, apparently under orders of Stark-Fujikawa (possibly as a mercenary). While he was shown to cherish Soviet paraphernalia and newspaper clippings featuring Boris Bullski, his identity was not firmly established. Sometime later, during a space mission to destroy an enormous asteroid that threatened to impact on Earth, a Titanium Man, claiming to be this same person, stated his name was Andy Stockwell, and had never had a connection with the USSR. However, moments later it was revealed he was actually a member of \\"The Hammer\\", an international network of communist sleeper cells who wanted to destroy the United States. He was lost in space, but being relatively close to Earth, may have returned under his own power. =Gennedy Ovinnik= Another version was introduced under the name Gennedy Ovinnik. Ovinnik, a Corporal in the Russian Military, 58th Army, North Caucasus District, was sent as an agent of the Russian Government along with Crimson Dynamo to defend Russian interest in Transia. The two were quickly overwhelmed by an army of Iron Man Armors controlled by the Zmaj only to be saved by Iron Man and Radioactive Man. Iron Man: Legacy Vol 1 4 =Other Titanium Men= A Titanium Man was contacted and hired, ostensibly through the Hammer again, to do a mercenary job for Tony Stark in his effort to stop the superhuman registration bill. Recently, the Titanium Man reappeared, this time in Russia, as a member of the rogue Soviet super-rebel group called Remont Six. He was knocked out by Darkstar, but was apparently not captured.Hulk: Winter Guard In the same period, another Titanium Man was seen being beaten down by Noh-Varr. The identity of this Titanium Man or the circumstances of the battle remain undisclosed.Avengers Vol. 4 2 A Titanium Man was among Iron Man's villains recruited by Mandarin and Zeke Stane to assist in a plot to take down Iron Man.Invincible Iron Man #513 During the Infinity storyline, a Titanium Man is among the villains recruited by Spymaster to help him attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower.Infinity: Heist #1 Titanium Man attacks Blizzard and Whirlwind when they try to abandon the mission.Infinity: Heist #2 During the fight, it is revealed that Titanium Man is the Kree Captain At-Lass who was sent by the Kree to steal Iron Man's armor.Infinity: Heist #3 Powers and abilities The Titanium Men used green armor similar to that used by Iron Man and to that used by the Crimson Dynamo (their sometime compatriot). Neither suit of armor was as sophisticated as that used by Tony Stark as Iron Man, but some of its weapons were deceptively powerful, and the first Titanium Man's physical strength seems to have been greater than that of Iron Man. He also boasted that his armor was made to last, not, like American technology, \\"with planned obsolescence\\" (although he had actually received several significant upgrades himself). The suit of armor increases the wearer's physical strength to superhuman levels, and is in fact stronger than Iron Man. It was also able to fly at supersonic speeds (it can even reach escape velocity), shoot concussive force blasts from the hands, project constrictive force \\"rings\\", fire an electromagnetically paralytic beam from the helmet, and was resistant to conventional artillery. Boris Bullski, the original Titanium Man, also possessed enhanced strength due to treatments given to him by the Soviet government to augment his physiology, making him grow into an 11-foot-tall giant. The Gremlin, being a dwarf who seldom exercised, was weaker than most people, but he possessed super-human intelligence, was capable of creating advanced devices and weapons, and was an accomplished genetic engineer. Other versions =Heroes Reborn — Iron Man= A Soviet Titanium Man, developed for the Russians by Victor von Doom, proved the better of the Iron Man prototype. Later, the same individual was shown, together with the Crimson Dynamo, as a free agent working for HYDRA. This Titanium Man was physically similar to the original mainstream version.Iron Man Vol. 2 #9 He is later killed by Doombots along with Crimson Dynamo and Black Knight. =Civil War: House of M= In the House of M reality, the second Titanium Man was seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.Civil War: House of M #2 In other media =Television= * Titanium Man appears in the Iron Man portion of The Marvel Super Heroes voiced by Ed McNamara.The Marvel Super Heroes on TV!

H. Kress & Co. five and ten cent store chain. With his fortune, Kress amassed one of the most significant collections of Italian Renaissance and European artwork assembled in the 20th century. In the 1950s and 1960s, a foundation established by Kress would donate 776 works of art from the Kress collection to 18 regional art museums in the United States. Biography Kress was born in the village of Cherryville, near Allentown, Pennsylvania, the second of seven children born to John Franklin Kress and Margaret Dodson (née Conner) Kress. His father was a retail merchant. His siblings were Mary Conner Kress, Jennie Weston Kress, Palmer John Kress, Claude Washington Kress, and Rush Harrison Kress. Another sibling, Elmer Kress, died ten days after birth. Kress never married or had children. He was a Mason. Young Kress worked in the stone quarries. Intelligent, energetic and precocious, he earned his teaching credentials by the age of 17 and began work as a schoolteacher. His first position was instructor for a class of 80 students, and he was paid $25 per month. He walked 3 miles each way to the schoolhouse. In 1887, Kress opened a stationery and notions store in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. As the business prospered he used his profits to open additional stores, naming his chain \\"S. H. Kress & Co.\\" These eventually would become popularly known as the \\"Kress Five and Dime\\" stores. Unlike many businessmen of his day who only opened their stores in large urban areas, Kress wisely located his stores in smaller cities in 29 states he felt had growth potential. These stores became the jewel of many of these cities, which only had a dry goods or general store until then. By the mid-1920s, he was living in a penthouse at 1020 Fifth Avenue in New York City, across the street from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which he visited and contributed to regularly. He was a major art collector and created the Samuel H. Kress Foundation to hold and dispose of his vast art collection. Kress died in 1955 and is interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. S. H. Kress & Co. A Kress store building, showing the characteristic design S. H. Kress & Co., a chain of \\"five and dime\\" retail department stores, was started in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, by Samuel H. Kress in 1896. Eventually expanding to over 200 locations nationwide, Kress stores were long a familiar sight in many cities and towns of the United States. The Kress chain was known for the fine architecture of the stores, with a number of locations being hailed by architects for their design. A number of former Kress stores, now put to other uses, are ranked as landmarks. Some of the most well-known Kress locations included New York City's Fifth Avenue; Canal Street, New Orleans; and Hollywood's Hollywood Boulevard. In 1964 ownership of Kress was acquired by Genesco, Inc. The company abandoned its center-city stores and moved to the shopping malls. Genesco began liquidating Kress and closing down the Kress stores in 1980. Samuel H. Kress Foundation Kress was founder and president of the eponymous Samuel H. Kress Foundation. An avid art lover, he acquired, through art dealer Joseph Duveen and with the advice of art historian William SuidaMorassi, Antonio, \\"Obituary: William Suida,\\" The Burlington Magazine, Vol.120, No. 689 (Aug., 1960) p. 371. , a collection of paintings and sculpture, primarily of the Italian Baroque school. Luckily for Kress, these paintings were thought to be \\"out of date\\" and \\"old fashioned\\" during the Victorian and Edwardian age, so he was able to purchase them at relatively low prices. In 1929 he gave the Italian government a large sum for the restoration of a number of architectural treasures in Italy. Beginning in the 1930s Kress decided to give much of his art collection to museums across the country while he was still alive. Many paintings were donated to the same smaller cities that had brought him his fortune with their stores. In several cases, his gifts became the founding basis for museums in those areas which otherwise could never have afforded artworks of such importance and quality. On March 17, 1941, Kress and Paul Mellon gave a large gift of art to the people of the United States, thereby establishing the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted the gift personally. Today, the masterpieces Kress donated are considered priceless and the Kress Foundation has dispensed millions of dollars to worthy organizations and institutions in the years since. =Museums with significant donations from the Kress Foundation= *Allentown Art Museum, Allentown, Pennsylvania (Paintings 50, Sculptures 3) *Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, Alabama (Paintings 34, Sculpture 2, Furniture 13, Decorative Arts 4) *Columbia Museum of Art, Columbia, South Carolina (Paintings 46, Sculptures 2, Bronzes 11, Furniture 9, Tapestries 10) *Denver Art Museum, Denver, Colorado (Paintings 46, Sculptures 4) *El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso, Texas (Paintings 56, Sculpture 2) *Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco, California (Paintings 37, Sculpture 1) *High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia (Paintings 29, Sculptures 3, Furniture 13) *Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu, Hawaii (Paintings 14) *Lowe Art Museum, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida (Paintings 44, Sculptures 3) *Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Memphis, Tennessee (Paintings 27, Sculptures 2) *Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Houston, Texas (Paintings 30) *National Building Museum, Washington, D.C. *National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

Visual memory describes the relationship between perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location.Berryhill, M. (2008, May 09). Visual memory and the brain. Retrieved from http://www.visionsciences.org/symposia2008_4.html Visual memory is a form of memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory.Magnussen, S. (2009). Cognition and Neurosciences: Implicit visual working memory, 50, 532-542 Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.  Neuroanatomy  In humans, areas specialized for visual object recognition in the ventral stream have a more inferior location in the temporal cortex, whereas areas specialized for the visual-spatial location of objects in the dorsal stream have a more superior location in the parietal cortex. However, these two streams hypothesis, although useful, are a simplification of the visual system because the two streams maintain intercommunication along their entire rostral course. = Posterior parietal cortex = Posterior parietal cortex (light green) is shown at the posterior area of the parietal lobe The posterior parietal cortex is a portion of the parietal lobe, which manipulates mental images, and integrates sensory and motor portions of the brain. A majority of experiments highlights a role of human posterior parietal cortex in visual working memory and attention. We therefore have to establish a clear separation of visual memory and attention from processes related to the planning of goal-directed motor behaviors. We can only hold in mind a minute fraction of the visual scene. These mental representations are stored in visual short-term memory.Todd, J, & Marois, R. (2004). Capacity limit of visual short term memory in human posterior parietal cortex. Retrieved from http://www.ioi.knaw.nl/viscog/temp/Todd%20(2004)%20Nature.pdf Activity in the posterior parietal cortex is tightly correlated with the limited amount of scene information that can be stored in visual short-term memory. These results suggest that the posterior parietal cortex is a key neural locus of our impoverished mental representation of the visual world. The posterior cortex might act as a capacity-limited store for the representation of the visual scene, the frontal/prefrontal cortex might be necessary for the consolidation and/or maintenance of this store, especially during extended retention intervals. = Visual cortex = The dorsal stream (green) and ventral stream (purple) are both actively involved in visual memory. Both pathways originate in the visual cortex There is a visual cortex in each hemisphere of the brain, much of which is located in the Occipital lobe. The left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals mainly from the right visual field and the right visual cortex mainly from the left visual field, although each cortex receives a considerable amount of information from the ipsilateral visual field as well. The visual cortex also receives information from subcortical regions, such as the lateral geniculate body, located in the thalamus. However, ample evidence indicates that object identity and location are preferentially processed in ventral (occipito-temporal) and dorsal (occipito-parietal) cortical visual streams, respectively. Comparison of rCBF during performance of the two tasks again revealed differences between the ventral and dorsal pathways.  Dorsal stream pathway  The dorsal stream pathway is mainly involved in the visual-spatial location of objects in the external world, and it is also known colloquially as the 'where' pathway. The dorsal stream pathway is also involved in the guidance of movements (e.g., reaching for an object in space), and is therefore implicated in the analysis of the movement of objects in addition to their spatial locations. The dorsal stream pathway begins with purely visual information in the occipital lobe, and then this information is transferred to the parietal lobe for spatial awareness functions. Specifically, the posterior parietal cortex is essential for \\"the perception and interpretation of spatial relationships, accurate body image, and the learning of tasks involving coordination of the body in space.\\"  Ventral stream pathway  The ventral stream pathway is mainly involved in object recognition, and is known colloquially as the 'what' pathway. It has connections to the medial temporal lobe (which is involved in the storage of long-term memories), the limbic system (which regulates emotions), and the dorsal stream pathway (which is involved in the visual-spatial locations and motions of objects). Therefore, the ventral stream pathway not only deals with the recognition of objects in the external world, but also the emotional judgement and analysis of these objects. The ventral stream pathway begins with purely visual information in the primary visual cortex (occipital lobe), and then this information is transferred to the temporal lobe. = Occipital lobes = Located at the back of the brain, the occipital lobes receive and process visual information. The occipital lobes also process colors and shapes. Whereas the right occipital lobe interprets images from the left visual space, the left occipital lobe interprets images from the right visual space. Damage to the occipital lobes can permanently damage visual perception[The human brain. (2009, July). Retrieved from http://www.allabouttbi.com/partsofthebrain]  Occipital lobe injury complications  Damage to the occipital lobe is characterized by loss of visual capability and the inability to identify colors both important processes in visual memory. = Short term visual memory = Visual short term memory is the capacity for holding a small amount of visual information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time (usually no more than 30 seconds). Although visual short term memory is essential for the execution of a wide array of perceptual and cognitive functions, and is supported by an extensive network of brain regions, its storage capacity is severely limited. Visual short-term memory storage is mediated by distinctive posterior brain mechanisms, such that capacity is determined both by a fixed number of objects and by object complexity. = Long term visual memory = Recall of the patterns from long term visual memory is associated with rCBF increases in different areas of the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.  Methods of study  = Benton visual retention test = stimulus is presented at the top, after a delay participants are asked to recall the correct target stimulus from the list of design cards. The Benton Visual Retention Test is an assessment of visual perception, and visual memory abilities.Benton visual retention test,® fifth edition. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.pearsonassessments.com/HAIWEB/Cultures/en- us/Productdetail.htm?Pid=015-8027-507&Mode;=summary More than 50 years of proven clinical use is the staple of the Benton Visual Retention Test. This test has proven its sensitivity to reading disabilities, nonverbal learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, attention-deficit disorder, alzheimer's, and other forms of dementia. During testing participants are presented with 10 cards for 10 seconds with unique designs on each. After the time has passed participants are asked to immediately reproduce the designs from each card using their visual memory. In the second stage participants are asked to copy each of the 10 card designs while the cards are in view. The participants results from each task are then assessed and placed into six categories; omissions, distortions, preservations, rotations, misplacements, and sizing errors. The further the participant's scores varies from the averages provided in the Benton Visual Retention Test manual the worse the participant is assessed to be on visual memory ability. The Benton Visual Retention Test has proved to be a generalizable test with the ability to be accurately administered to participants aged 8-adult, and no gender effect. Some studies have suggested a significant gender and education interaction indicating that an age-associated decline in visual memory performance may be more prominent for those individuals with a lower education level. = Neuroimaging tests = geometrical pattern a subject would encode, store, and recall while performing a visual memory neuroimaging test. Neuroimaging studies focus on the neural networks involved in visual memory using methods designed to activate brain areas involved in encoding, storage, and recall. These studies involve the use of one or multiple types of brain imaging techniques designed to measure timing or activation within the brain. The data collected from neuroimaging studies gives researchers the ability to visualize which brain regions are activated in specific cognitive visual memory tasks. With the use of brain imaging devices researchers able to further investigate memory performance above and beyond standard tests based on exact response times, and activation.  Control condition  The subject's resting brain activation level is first determined in order to form a control or 'baseline' to measure from. Subjects are blindfolded and instructed to lay motionless while simultaneously eliminating any visual imagery present in their mind's eye. These instructions are intended to minimize the activation of brain regions involved in visual memory to form a true resting brain state. After the scan is complete a control has been formed which can be compared with activated regions of the brain while performing visual memory tasks.  Activation condition  During encoding, participants are typically exposed to 1–10 visual patterns while connected to a brain imaging device. As the subject encodes the visual patterns researchers are able to directly view the activation of areas involved in visual memory encoding. During recall subjects again need to have all visual stimuli removed by means of a dark room or blindfolding to avoid interfering activation of other visual areas in the brain. Subjects are asked to recall each image clearly in their mind's eye. While recalling the images researchers are able view the areas activated by the visual memory task. Comparing the control 'baseline' state to the activated areas during the visual memory task allows researchers to view which areas are used during visual memory.  Current theories  = Visuo-spatial sketch pad = The visuo-spatial sketchpad is part of Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory. It is responsible for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is thought of as a three-dimensional cognitive map, which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on.Logie, R.H., & Marchetti, C. (1991). Mental images in human cognition. Elsevier Science Publishers. Pg. 105-113 It is used in tasks such as mental image manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, change of colour, etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one which you have a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of vividness is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad. = Eidetic or 'photographic memory' = Eidetic memory is an ability to recall images, sounds, or objects in memory with high precision for a few minutes without using mnemonics. It occurs in a small number of children and generally is not found in adults. The popular culture concept of “photographic memory,” where (e.g.) someone can briefly look at a page of text and then recite it perfectly from memory, is not the same as seeing eidetic images, and photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist. = Iconic memory = Iconic memory is the visual part of the sensory memory system. Iconic memory is responsible for visual priming, because it works very quickly and unconsciously. Iconic memory decays very quickly, but contains a very vivid image of the surrounding stimuli. = Spatial memory = Spatial memory is a person's knowledge of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, and how to get to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The number of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is. = Object memory = Object memory involves processing features of an object or material such as texture, color, size, and orientation. It is processed mainly in the ventral regions of the brain. A few studies have shown that on average most people can recall up to four items each with a set of four different visual qualities. It is a separate system from spatial memory and is not affected by interference from spatial tasks.  Accuracy  Visual memory is not always accurate and can be misled by outside conditions. This can be seen in studies carried out by Elizabeth Loftus and Gary Wells. In one study by Wells, individuals were exposed to misleading information after witnessing an event; they were then tested on their ability to remember details from this event. Their findings included: when given misinformation that contradicts the witnessed event they were less able to recall those details; and whether misinformation was given before or after the witnessed event did not seem to matter. Furthermore, visual memory can be subjected to various memory errors which will affect accuracy.  Visual memory in education  “We do not store and retrieve words based on visual memory.” “Our phonological filing system is the basis for word memory/word recognition.” -Dr. Kilpatrick (Equipped for Reading Success). Visual memory, in an academic environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students must be able to look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.Cusimano, Addie, &, Initials. (2009, July). Visual memory and beyond. Retrieved from http://www.achievepublications.com/chpt3.html Children who have not developed their visual memory skills cannot readily reproduce a sequence of visual stimuli. They frequently experience difficulty in remembering the overall visual appearance of words or the letter sequence of words for reading and spelling.  Factors affecting visual memory  = Sleep = Findings surrounding sleep and visual memory have been mixed. Studies have reported performance increases after a bout of sleep compared with the same period of waking. The implications of this are that there is a slow, offline process during sleep that strengthens and enhances the memory trace. Further studies have found that quiet rest has shown the same learning benefits as sleep. Replay has been found to occur during post-training quiet wakefulness as well as sleep. In a recent study where a visual search task was administered quiet rest or sleep is found to be necessary for increasing the amount of associations between configurations and target locations that can be learned within a day. Reactivation in sleep was only observed after extensive training of rodents on familiar tasks. It rapidly dissipates; it also makes up a small proportion of total recorded activity in sleep. It has also been found that there are gender differences between males and females in regards to visual memory and sleep. In a study done testing sleep and memory for pictures it was found that daytime sleep contributed to retention of source memory rather than item memory in females, females did not have recollection or familiarity influenced by daytime sleep, whereas males undergoing daytime sleep had a trend towards increased familiarity. The reasons for this may be linked to different memory traces resulting from different encoding strategies, as well as with different electrophysiological changes during daytime sleep. = Brain Damage = Brain damage is another factor that has been found to have an effect on visual memory. Memory impairment affects both novel and familiar experiences. Poor memory after damage to the brain is usually considered to result from information being lost or rendered inaccessible. With such impairment it is assumed that it must be due to the incorrect interpretation of previously encountered information as being novel. In experiments testing rats’ object recognition memory it was found that memory impairment can be the opposite, that there was a tendency to treat novel experiences as familiar. A possible solution for this impairment could be the use of a visual-restriction procedure that reduces interference. = Age = Studies have shown that with aging, in terms of short-term visual memory, viewing time and task complexity affect performance. When there is a delay or when the task is complex recall declines.Hallikainen, M., Hanninen, T., Koivisto, K., Partanen, K., Pitkanen, A., Soininen, H.S., Riekkinen, P.J., Vainio, P. (1994). Volumetric MRI analysis of the amygdala and the hippocampus in subjects with age-associated memory impairment. In a study conducted to measure whether visual memory in older adults with age-related visual decline was caused by memory performance or visual functioning, the following were examined: relationships among age, visual activity, and visual and verbal memory in 89 community dwelling volunteers aged 60–87 years. The findings were that the effect of vision was not specific to visual memory. Therefore, vision was found to be correlated with general memory function in older adults and is not modality specific. As we age performance in regards to spatial configurations deteriorates. In a task to store and combine two different spatial configurations to form a novel one young people out-performed the elderly.Bhatt, E., Cattaneo, Z., Merabet, L.B., Pece, A., Vecchi, T. (2008). The Influence of Reduced Visual Acuity on Age-Related Decline in Spatial Working Memory: An Investigation. Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition. Vision also has an effect on performance. Sighted participants outperformed the visually impaired regardless of testing modality. This suggests that vision tends to shape the general supramodal mechanisms of memory. = Alcohol = Studies have shown that there is an effect of alcohol on visual memory. In a recent study visual working memory and its neutral correlates was assessed in university students who partake in binge drinking, the intermittent consumption of large amounts of alcohol. The findings revealed that there may be binge-drinking related functional alteration in recognition working memory processes. This suggests that impaired prefrontal cortex function may occur at an early age in binge drinkers. Another study conducted in 2004Burke, C., Paulus, M., Pulido, C., Schuckit, M., Tapert, S.F. (2004). Level of Response to Alcohol and Brain Response during Visual Working Memory. Journal of Studies on Alcohol. 692-700. examined the level of response to alcohol and brain response during visual working memory. This study looked at the neural correlated of the low level of response to alcohol using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a challenging visual memory task. The results were that young people who report having needed more alcohol to feel the effects showed higher levels of brain response during visual working memory, this suggests that the individual's capacity to adjust to cognitive processing decreases, they are less able to adjust cognitive processing to contextual demands.  Dysfunction of visual memory  Hallucinatory palinopsia, which is a dysfunction of visual memory, is caused by posterior visual pathway cortical lesions and seizures, most commonly in the non-dominant parietal lobe. Focal hyperactivity causes persistent activation of a visual cortex-hippocampal neuronal circuit which encodes an object or scene that is already in visual memory. \\"All of the hallucinatory palinopsia symptoms occur concomitantly in a patient with one lesion, which supports current evidence that objects, features, and scenes are all units of visual memory, perhaps at different levels of processing. This alludes to neuroanatomical integration in visual memory creation and storage.\\" Studying the excitability alterations associated with palinopsia in migraineurs could provide insight on mechanisms of encoding visual memory. One common group of people that have visual memory problems are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities are caused by failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show it is more likely that it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word.Catts, H.W. (2005). Language and reading disabilities. Allyn & Bacon, an imprint of Pearson Education Inc. pg. 102-106 This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to hold onto the visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities. These parts are the sustained and transient visual processing systems. The sustained system is responsible for fine detail such as word and letter recognition and is very important in encoding words in their correct order. The transient system is responsible for controlling eye movements, and processing the larger visual environment around us. When these two processes do not work in synchronization this can cause reading disabilities. This has been tested by having children with and without reading disabilities perform on tasks related to the transient systems, where the children with reading disabilities did very poorly. It has also been found in postmortem examinations of the brains of people with reading disabilities that they have fewer neurons and connections in the areas representing the transient visual systems. However, there is debate over whether this is the only reason for reading disabilities, scotopic sensitivity syndrome, deficits in verbal memory and orthographic knowledge are other proposed factors. Deficits in visual memory can also be caused by disease and/or trauma to the brain. These can lead to the patient losing their spatial memory, and/or their visual memory for specific things. For example, a patient “L.E.” suffered brain damage and her ability to draw from memory was severely diminished, whilst her spatial memory remained normal. Other patients represent the opposite, where memory for colors and shapes is unaffected but spatial memory for previously known places is greatly impaired. These case studies show that these two types of visual memory are located in different parts of the brain and are somewhat unrelated in terms of functioning in daily life.

The game was advertised as featuring eight games: seven short subsections with the same basic gameplay, and two minigames. The game was later released for the Wii and Wii U Virtual Consoles. An enhanced remake titled Kirby Super Star Ultra was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008 and 2009. Nintendo re-released Kirby Super Star in Japan, the United States and Europe in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition. The game was released on the Nintendo Switch Online service on December 12, 2019. Gameplay Kirby Super Star is a side- scrolling platform game. Similar to previous entries in the Kirby series, the player controls Kirby to complete various levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Kirby can walk or run, jump, swim, crouch, slide, and inhale enemies or objects to spit them out as bullets. He can fly for a limited time by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, though he can release a weak puff of air. By eating certain enemies, Kirby can gain copy abilities, power-ups allowing him to take on the properties the enemy possessed. In Kirby Super Star, Kirby gains the ability to guard so he can defend himself from weak attacks. If Kirby uses a copy ability, he can produce a Helper, a character that can be controlled automatically or by another player. Like Kirby, Helpers can float continuously, but can only use the copy ability they were based on. The player can also grant the Helper a different form or revert them into a power-up in an emergency. The player characters lose health if they are hit by enemies or hazards. If the Helper loses all their health, there is a short time for Kirby to grant it a new power before it disappears. If Kirby loses all of his health, the player will lose a life. Health can be replenished by eating food scattered across levels. Losing all lives results in a game over. =Game modes= Cutter Kirby and Rocky, fighting Dyna Blade in the unlockable game The Arena. Kirby Super Star is split into seven smaller games, six primary and one supplemental, in addition to two minigames. While most retain the same game mechanics, they have different stories and objectives. Some games must be unlocked by playing others, and all must be finished to complete the game. * Spring Breeze: a remake of the first Kirby game, Kirby's Dream Land (1992), with the gameplay enhancements of Kirby Super Star. Kirby must make his way to a castle to challenge King Dedede, who has stolen food from the citizens of Dream Land. Several levels from the original have been merged, while some boss fights were cut. * Dyna Blade: Kirby must stop Dyna Blade, a giant bird, from disturbing Dream Land's crops. The mode consists of four levels that the player must clear before facing off against Dyna Blade. There are also two secret areas and a mini-boss that moves across the world map. * Gourmet Race: a racing game in which Kirby races King Dedede while eating as much food as possible. It takes place across three levels of varying length; whoever earns the most points by the end of all levels wins, with bonus points awarded to the first to finish each race. Players can choose to race either King Dedede or a \\"ghost\\" (the player's best attempt at the race), or simply race alone for the fastest time. * The Great Cave Offensive: a Metroidvania adventure that sees Kirby explore a cave for treasure. 60 treasure chests are hidden across four areas. Some treasures reference other Nintendo franchises, such as the Triforce (The Legend of Zelda), Captain Falcon's helmet (F-Zero), and Mr. Saturn (EarthBound); others reference valuable items that appear in role- playing video games, such as Orichalcum. * Revenge of Meta Knight: a story- driven mode chronicling Kirby's efforts to stop Meta Knight, who attempts to take over Dream Land and end the inhabitants' lazy lifestyle by invading in his signature airship, the Battleship Halberd. Each level has a time limit, and Kirby will lose a life if the player does not finish in time. The Halberd takes damage after every level, and a meter at the bottom of the screen shows the ship's status. The player fights numerous bosses, and the mode culminates in a chase to escape the falling Halberd. * Milky Way Wishes: the largest mode in the game. Because the Sun and Moon around planet Popstar are fighting, a jester-like creature named Marx tells Kirby he must travel across nine planets and restore the giant wish-granting comet-clock Nova. Unlike the other modes, Kirby cannot use copy abilities; instead, he collects \\"Copy Essence Deluxes\\". Once in Kirby's possession, they allow the player to select a copy ability from a list and are kept permanently. The mode also features scrolling shooter levels. In the end, Marx—who masterminded the conflict—wishes to Nova to control Popstar, but Kirby stops him. * The Arena: a boss attack mode that challenges the player to fight every boss in the game with only one life and a free selection of power-up at the start of the game. The player can replenish their health up to five times total between rounds, and are granted two power- ups at random. Completing The Arena unlocks a sound test. * Sub-games: two minigames that can be played single-player or multiplayer. They include Samurai Kirby, a timing game reminiscent of a minigame from Kirby's Adventure (1993), and Megaton Punch, where players must punch a planet to make a bigger crack than their opponent. Development Development on Kirby Super Star lasted longer than usual for the era, and as a result it released late in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's (pictured) life cycle. Kirby Super Star was developed in Japan by HAL Laboratory and directed by Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai. It was the third Kirby game he directed, following Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure. Although a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) title, the Kirby Super Star prototype was developed for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. According to Sakurai, although the prototype was for internal use only, it was almost complete and some of Kirby's animations were nearly identical in the final game. The prototype was used to test out ideas before implementing them in the final product; Sakurai said having the game operating on an internal build made it easier to develop ideas. HAL president Satoru Iwata had little involvement with the game, and left development under Sakurai's supervision. For Kirby Super Star, Sakurai \\"had three pillars in mind. One was two-player cooperative gameplay and another was including actions similar to those in fighting games. The third was an omnibus format.\\" The addition of cooperative gameplay was something Shigeru Miyamoto requested. While Sakurai knew a SNES Kirby game would mean bigger, more detailed characters and graphics, he wanted to hear from Miyamoto before thinking about the foundation and other important aspects. Sakurai and Iwata traveled to Kyoto; there, Miyamoto told them he wanted cooperative gameplay, something uncommon in side-scrolling platform games. Miyamoto had dreamed of creating a cooperative game in his Super Mario franchise for many years, but was unable to until New Super Mario Bros. Wii in 2009 because of how fast the series' gameplay is. Kirby, on the other hand, is slower-paced, so Miyamoto figured it would be possible. Sakurai thought about it and came up with the idea to have a main player and an assisting one; this led to the conception of Helpers, which he thought opened the door for inexperienced players. As for including fighting game-like moves, Sakurai made enemies stronger. He did this because \\"[t]he main player would simply hurl blades and lay waste to opponents while the Helper just watched.\\" Additionally, he expanded copy abilities' possibilities so players could perform multiple actions by pressing the same button, similar to fighting games. The game was also the first in the series in which Kirby's appearance changed depending on his copy ability. The omnibus format was chosen because Sakurai noted most SNES and some NES games were of considerable length, and prices were high. Kirby Super Star served as \\"the antithesis to that trend,\\" with Sakurai hoping to create sections with different stories and gameplay that appealed to both experienced and inexperienced players. Spring Breeze, a remake of Kirby's Dream Land, was designed for beginners and is thus Super Star first mode. The title is a quote from the Dream Land manual that \\"describe[s] Kirby as a youth who came with the spring breeze,\\" and was chosen to signify its simplicity. Originally, Sakurai was going to remove copy abilities to remain faithful to the original game while teaching beginners how to play, but ultimately did not. Development lasted three years, longer than usual for the era. This was partially due to the influence Rare's Donkey Kong Country (1994), a game that incorporated CG graphics. Sakurai was certain using CG would be beneficial, so the team redid the artwork about halfway through development. HAL's development schedule also lengthened development. Sakurai planned to include an additional game mode, Kagero Mansion, which was discarded due to time constraints. Kagero Mansion was a horror game with an emphasis on action and puzzle elements; it saw Kirby stuck in a mansion and unable to inhale. HAL also planned to add a move that allowed Kirby to create an explosion from guarding, but cut the idea. Kirby Super Star was one of the last SNES games, released just three months before the launch of the system's successor, the Nintendo 64. Publisher Nintendo released the game in Japan on March 21, 1996, in North America on September 20, 1996, and in Europe on January 23, 1997. In Japan, the title is Kirby of the Stars: Super Deluxe, while in Europe, it is Kirby's Fun Pak. Its working title was Kirby of the Stars: Active, which \\"suggest[ed] that the game was more proactive and had more active gameplay.\\" Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi came up with the final title, which Sakurai said \\"convey[s] how rich it is in content\\". The Japanese packaging was designed to resemble a Paulownia box, an idea that originated from Itoi. This was because expensive sake and silverware is often sold in Paulownia boxes, and the team thought the game was special. Rereleases Kirby Super Star was rereleased on the Wii and Wii U via Nintendo's Virtual Console, a digital distribution service. The Wii version was released in Japan in October 2009 and in the West in May 2010, and the Wii U version was released worldwide in May 2013. The game was also included in Kirby's Dream Collection (2012), a 20th anniversary compilation of Kirby titles for the Wii. =Kirby Super Star Ultra= Kirby Super Star Ultra, known in Japan as Kirby of the Stars: Ultra Super Deluxe, is a remake of Kirby Super Star for the Nintendo DS, developed to commemorate the series' 15th anniversary. Kirby Super Star Ultra retains all game modes found in the original, but adds four new ones: Revenge of the King, a more difficult version of Spring Breeze; Meta Knightmare Ultra, which allows the player to traverse levels as Meta Knight; Helper to Hero, in which the player controls Helpers and fights bosses; and True Arena, an updated version of The Arena. It also includes three new minigames, integration of the DS touchscreen, wireless multiplayer for up to four players via DS Download Play, enhanced graphics and audio, and full-motion video cutscenes. HAL's Shinya Kumazaki directed Super Star Ultra. It was originally called Super Deluxe Plus, but was retitled after producer Masayoshi Tanimura requested that the team provide fan service that exceeded customer expectations. The team's goal was to retain all modes from the SNES original; despite the game's considerable size, Kumazaki believed he could not remove anything due to fans' hopes. Adjustments were made for new players, while HAL managed to retain multiplayer through the DS's wireless functionality. Some developers thought the game changed so much it could be considered a new product. The packaging was designed with a coat of glitter to retain the sense of luxury the Paulownia box design gave to the original, as project coordinator Mari Shirakawa felt Paulownia would not appeal to children. Kirby Super Star Ultra was released in North America on September 29, 2008, in Japan on November 6, 2008, and in Europe on December 18, 2009. Reception Kirby Super Star was both a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies in Japan. It received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings, and is widely regarded as one of the best games of the franchise. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded the large amount of content, simultaneous two-player mode, graphics, and Kirby's power- absorbing ability. Captain Cameron of GamePro gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 in sound, control, and FunFactor, and a 4.5 out of 5 in graphics. He commented that \\"The perfect execution of the varied controls leads to simple-but- charming fun.\\" Reviewing the Virtual Console release, Nintendo Life praised the \\"impressive\\" musical score and \\"colorful\\" visuals. Kirby Super Star Ultra received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 32 out of 40. 1UP praised the game for its multiplayer and described it as \\"excellent\\", but noted that it was not very difficult and the level design was not as intricate as in the Mario series. IGN's Craig Harris said that, while fun, the game is \\"a bit on the easy side\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly named Kirby Super Star a runner-up for Side-Scrolling Game of the Year (behind Guardian Heroes). On December 11, 2008, Super Star Ultra became a Famitsu Gold title. As of January 11, 2009, Kirby Super Star Ultra has sold 1,021,000 copies in Japan. It was also the ninth best-selling game of Japan in 2008. As of December 2008, it was the fifth best-selling Nintendo DS game in the U.S. Legacy Many of the music tracks in Kirby Super Star have been remixed in various games, such as the Super Smash Bros. series; the Nintendo 64 game, for instance, had a new version of the Gourmet Race theme as Kirby's theme song. Kirby Super Star was made available on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on October 13, 2009, in North America on May 17, 2010 and in the PAL region on May 28, 2010. The Wii U Virtual Console version was released in Japan on May 1, 2013 and in North America and Europe on May 23, 2013. When released in Europe for the Wii U Virtual Console, the North American version was included instead of the European version. It was also one of the games included in Kirby's Dream Collection, which was released for the Wii in celebration of the series' 20th anniversary. Meta Knight's battleship, the Halberd, would reappear in Kirby: Squeak Squad, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Kirby's Epic Yarn, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Kirby: Planet Robobot. A stage based on The Great Cave Offensive appears in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. In reference to the scope of the mode of the same name, the arena is amongst the largest stages in the game's catalog, and thus supports up to eight players. It features a unique mechanic dubbed the \\"Danger Zones\\", stage hazards that instantly KO any fighter whose percentages exceed 100%. The stage was brought back in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game is also included in the Super NES Classic Edition.

The Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso () (PUCV), also known as Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (UCV), is one of six Catholic universities in Chile and one of the two pontifical universities in the country, along with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. It is located in Valparaíso, Chile and has approximately 14,000 students. PUCV attracts students from different areas of Chile, as well as hundreds of exchange students from Europe, North America and several countries from South America, due to its convenient student exchange programs. It is recognized as a traditional institution with high academic prestige and as a complex university due to its important research and educational development in the fields of science, engineering, humanities and arts. As a Catholic university, it answers directly to the Holy See and the Bishopric of Valparaíso. It is a private university with state support. PUCV is an urban university. It has a central campus known as Casa Central (Central House) located in downtown Valparaíso, only a few blocks away from the Chilean Congress, the Metro, and the Pacific Ocean. One of the drawbacks of being an urban university is the difficulty of growing at the original site of its foundation. Several PUCV buildings are on the historic palm-tree-lined Avenida Brasil, but most of its schools are dispersed in throughout Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Quilpué and Quillota. It was positioned 29th at the QS Latin America University Ranking 2014 (5th nationwide). At the 2014 edition of the América Economía magazine university ranking, it was positioned 5th nationwide and first in the Region of Valparaiso. Profile The UCV offers undergraduate degrees in more than 50 subjects, including architecture, design, horticulture, industrial engineering, business, law, accounting and finance and spanish. The school of architecture, also called \\"The Valparaíso School\\" in architectural circles, constructed an experimental city called the Open City, a few kilometers North of Valparaíso, where the professors teach and live in the houses that they and the students design and build. PUCV architects have a reputation for being highly creative, having studied at a school that mixes the architectural design and building processes with poetry and physical activities. Similarly, in the Quillota campus the program in horticulture is offered within an experimental station. This campus is visited by more than 1,500 people each year, and has outstanding collections of subtropical and temperate fruit trees, a nursery. The station of 500,000 square metres has more than 50,000 square metres of greenhouses. The diversity of the PUCV is one of its strengths, with a rainbow trout farm near Los Andes, a legislative consultancy group (CEAL), a farm in Quillota with an area of 6 km², a fruit packing house specialized in avocados and citrus fruits (joint venture with Exportadora Santa Cruz), a TV station, that has been on the air since 1957 (the first in the country), a radio station, a publishing house, and an experimental grade school and high school for boys in Viña del Mar. All of these units welcome interns and scholars, both from PUCV and other universities. The PUCV houses the editorial offices of journals in marine biology, law, religion, philosophy, psychology, and biotechnology. Explora, a special government program to promote science in primary and secondary schools, is also hosted by the PUCV. History It was founded in March 1928, supported by the generous contribution of Isabel Caces de Brown. Even older, the Law School was established in 1894 as an independent college by the Sacred Heart Fathers, and was later incorporated into the University (since both were units of the Roman Catholic Church). The first undergraduate majors offered by the PUCV were electrical engineering, construction, chemistry, mining, business administration, mechanical engineering, decorative arts, and merchant marine studies. The Pontifical title was conferred by Pope John Paul II and announced at the inauguration of the 2003 academic year by Zenon Grocholewski, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education. Administration PUCV is a private institution dependent upon the Roman Catholic Church. As some other old private universities in Chile, PUCV receives some funding from the Chilean government. PUCV's Grand Chancellor is the Bishop of Valparaíso, who appoints representatives in the Academic Council but does not directly run the University (responsibility of a faculty-elected Rector). The Council includes the Deans of each faculty, all of whom are elected by the faculty. The appointment of PUCV officers and structural changes in its administration need the approval of the Holy See, with periodic reviews by the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Roman Curia. Doctoral honoris causa degrees need to be approved by the Congregation. Faculties and undergraduate programs Currently, PUCV has 63 undergraduate programs, 15 doctorate programs, 35 master programs and 82 other postgraduate programs. *Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism **Art, Architecture, Graphic Design, Industrial Design *Faculty of Agriculture **Fruit Science, Vegetable Crops and Ornamentals, Environmental Management, Food Technology *Faculty of Science **Mathematics, Statistics, Biology, Physics, Chemistry *Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences **Management, Accounting Auditing, Social Work, Journalism *Faculty of Engineering **Biochemical Eng, Chemical Eng, Civil Eng, Computing Eng, Construction Eng, Electrical and Electronic Eng, Industrial Eng, Mechanical Eng, Transportation Eng, *Faculty of Law **Law *Faculty of Natural Resources **Geography, Oceanography, Aquaculture and Fisheries *Faculty of Philosophy and Education **Philosophy, Psychology, Education, Special Education, Physical Education, History, Spanish and English, Music *Ecclesiastical Faculty of Theology – Institute of Religious Studies **Religious Studies International relations PUCV has a long history of academic relations with institutions all over the world, with more than 260 agreements concentrated in European universities.

He has been called the \\"Father of Modern Malayalam\\", or, alternatively, the \\"Father of Malayalam Literature\\", or the \\"Primal Poet in Malayalam\\". He was one of pioneers of a major shift in Kerala literary production (the domesticated religious textuality associated with the Bhakti movement). The number and circulation of his texts far outdo that of any other poet of premodern Kerala. Ezhuthachan was born in the Thunchaththu home at present-day Tirur, northern Kerala, in a traditional Hindu family of the Sudra caste. Little is known with certainty about his life. His success even in his own lifetime seems to have been great. Later he or his followers shifted to a village near Palakkad, further east into the Kerala, and established a hermitage (the \\"Ramananda ashrama\\") and a Brahmin residence there. This institution probably housed both Brahmin and Sudra literary students. The school eventually pioneered the \\"Ezhuthachan movement\\", associated with the concept of popular Bhakti, in Kerala. Ezhuthachan's ideas have been variously linked by scholars either with philosopher Ramananda, who founded the Ramanandi sect, or Ramanuja, the single most influential thinker of devotional Hinduism. For centuries before Ezhuthachan, Kerala people had been producing literary texts in Malayalam and in the Arya (Grantha) Scripts. However, he is celebrated as the \\"Primal Poet\\" or the \\"Father of Malayalam Proper\\" for his Malayalam recomposition of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana. This work rapidly circulated around Kerala middle- caste homes as a popular devotional text. It can be said that Ezhuthachan brought the then unknown Sanskrit-Puranic literature to the level of common understanding (domesticated religious textuality). His other major contribution has been in mainstreaming the current Malayalam alphabet.  Sources  The first Western scholar to take an interest in Ezhuthachan was Arthur C. Burnell (1871). The following two texts are the standard sources on Ezhuthachan. * \\"Eluttaccan and His Age\\" (1940) by C. Achyuta Menon (Madras: University of Madras). * \\"Adhyatma Ramayanam\\" (1969) edited by A. D. Harisharma (Kottayam: Sahitya Pravarthaka Co-operative). = Historical Ezhuthachan = There is no firm historical evidence for Ezhuthachan the author. Main historical sources of Ezhuthachan and his life are * Quasi- historical verses referring to Ezhuthachan (from Chittur Madhom). * An institutional line of masters or gurus, beginning with one Thunchaththu Sri Guru, is mentioned in one oral verse from Chittur Madhom. This lineage can be historically verified. * An inscription giving the details of the founding of the residence (agraharam), hermitage (mathom), and temples in Chittur. This was under the direction of Suryanarayanan Ezhuthachan (with support of the local chieftain). This locale can be historically verified.  Period  Arthur C. Burnell was the first Western scholar to take an interest in Ezhuthachan. Ezhuthachan is generally believed to have lived around the sixteenth or seventeenth century. * Arthur C. Burnell (1871) dates Ezhuthachan to seventeenth century. He discovered the date from a title deed (found in a manuscript collection preserved in Chittur). The deed relates to the date of the founding of the Gurumadhom of Chittur. * William Logan (1887) dates Ezuthachan to the seventeenth century (he supports the dates given by Burnell). * Hermann Gundert dates Ezuthachan to the seventeenth century. * Kovunni Nedungadi dates Ezuthachan to the fifteenth century. * Govinda Pillai dates Ezuthachan to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. He cites the Kali chronogram 'ayurarogyaa saukhyam' that appears at end of the Narayaneeyam of Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (a possible senior contemporary of Ezhuthachan). * A. R. Kattayattu Govindra Menon cites the Kali chronogram 'pavitramparam saukhyam' as a reference to the date of Ezuthachan 's samadhi. * Chittur Gurumadhom authorities also cites the chronogram 'pavitramparam saukhyam' as a reference to the date of Ezuthachan 's samadhi. The word 'surya' is sometimes suffixed to the chronogram. * R. Narayana Panikkar supports Govinda Pillai's date (the fifteenth or sixteenth century). The date is based on Ezhuthachan's contemporaneity with Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (whom he dates to c. 1531 – c. 1637 AD). He also mentions certain Nilakantan \\"Nambudiri \\", a possible senior contemporary of Ezhuthachan (fl. c. 1565 and c. 1601 AD). * P. K. Narayana Pillai cites a Kali chronogram 'nakasyanyunasaukhyam' or 1555 AD (from a verse relating to the founding of the matham of Chittur) on the date of Ezhuthachan. He dates Nilakanthan, the possible master of Ezhuthachan, to c. 1502 AD. * Poet-turned-historian Ulloor S. Parameshwara Iyer has argued that Ezhuthachan was born in 1495 AD and lived up to 1575 AD * A time frame similar to Ulloor was proposed by scholar C. Radhakrishnan. * Scholar Sheldon Pollock dates Ezuthachan to the sixteenth century. * Rich Freeman dates Ezhuthachan to late sixteenth-early seventeenth century.  Life and career  Entrance (modern) gate to Thunchan Parambu, Tirur Thunchan Parambu = Biography = Little is known with certainty about Ezhuthachan's life. Ezhuthachan was born at Trikkandiyoor, near the modern-day town of Tirur, in northern Kerala. It is known that his lineage home was \\"Thunchaththu\\". His parents' names are not known, and there are disputes about his given name as well. The name Ezhuthachan, meaning Father of Letters, was a generic title for any village schoolteacher in premodern Kerala. As a boy he seems to have exhibited uncommon intelligence. He was probably educated by his elder brother (early in his life). After his early education he is believed to have travelled in the other parts of India (outside Kerala) and learned Sanskrit and some other Dravidian languages. It is believed that Ezhuthachan on his way back from Tamil Nadu had a stopover at Chittur (in Palakkad) and in due course settled down at Thekke Gramam near Anikkode with his disciples. A hermitage (the \\"Ramananda ashrama\\") and a Brahmin residence (agraharam), at a site now known as the Chittur Gurumadhom, were established by him (on a piece of land bought from the landlord of Chittur). The institution was flanked by temples of gods Rama and Siva. It probably housed both Brahmin and Sudra students. The street still has an array of agraharas (where the twelve Brahmin families migrated along with Ezhuthachan live). Ezhuthachan was eventually associated with an institutional line of masters (gurus). The locale and lineage of these masters can be historically verified. He and his disciples seem to have ignited a whole new literary movement in Kerala. Its style and content nearly overshadowed the earlier Sanskrit poetry. He is believed to have attained samadhi at the Gurumadhom at Chittur. A verse chanted by the ascetics of the mathom during their daily prayers makes a reference to the following line of masters. * Thunchaththu Sri Guru * Sri Karunakaran * Sri Suryanarayanan * Sri Deva Guru * Sri Gopala Guru  Myths and legends  * Legends consider Ezhuthachan as a \\"gandharva\\" (divine being) who in his previous birth was a witness to the Great War in the Mahabharata. * As a young boy Ezhuthachan corrected the Brahmins at Trikkandiyoor Temple. * The Brahmins grew uneasy and gave the boy some plantains to eat, and as a resulting inebriety the boy lost his speech. To counteract this Ezhuthachan's father gave him palm beverage and the boy had his speech restored. Ezhuthachan remained addicted to intoxicants. * Saraswati, the Goddess of Learning and Arts, is believed to have helped him to complete the Devi Mahatmya. * Ezhuthachan is credited with endowing a monkey with the gift of speech. * It is believed that the Raja of Ambalappuzha requested him to decipher a Telugu manuscript on Adhyatma Ramayanam. * It is also said that Ezhuthachan had a young daughter, who copied his works for the first time. * Ezhuthachan or his follower Suryanarayanan predicted the downfall of zamorin's family (the then rulers of Calicut). And the zamorin sought his help to perform a Sakteya Puja. * It is said that Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri sought the advice of Ezhuthachan on how to start his Narayaneeyam.  Contributions  Ezhuthachan—although he lived around sixteenth century AD—has been called the \\"father of modern Malayalam\\", or, alternatively, the \\"father of Malayalam literature\\". His success even in his own lifetime seems to have been great. No original compositions are attributed to Ezhuthachan. His main works generally are based on Sanskrit compositions. Linguists are unanimous in assigning Adhyatma Ramayanam and Sri Mahabharatam to Ezhuthachan. The Ramayanam—the most popular work—depicts the hero, Rama, an ideal figure both as man and god. Sri Mahabharatam omits all episodes not strictly relevant to the story of the Pandavas and is generally considered as a work of greater literary merit than the Ramayanam. However, there is no unanimity among the scholars about the authorship of certain other works generally ascribed to him. These include the Brahmanda Puranam, Uttara Ramayanam, Devi Mahatmyam, and Harinama Kirtanam. Ezhuthachan's other major contribution has been in mainstreaming (the current) Malayalam alphabet (derived chiefly from the Sanskrit Grantha, or the Arya Script) as the replacement for the old Vattezhuthu (the then-30-letter script of Malayalam). The Arya script permitted the free use of Sanskrit in Malayalam writing. = Ezhuthachan movement = Ezhuthachan introduced a movement of domesticated religious textuality in Kerala. He was a significant voice of the Bhakti movement in south India. The Bhakti movement was a collective opposition to Brahmanical excesses and the moral and political decadence of the then-Kerala society. The shift of literary production in Kerala to a largely Sanskritic, puranic religiosity is attributed this movement. Ezhuthachan's school promoted popular and non-Brahman (Bhakti) literary production. His works were also a general opposition against the moral decadence of the 16th century Kerala society.  Adhyatma Ramayanam  317x317px Copy of Ezhuthachan's 251x251px Adhyatma Ramayanam, written in the parrot-song style, is Ezhuthachan's principle work. It is not an adaptation from the original Valmiki Ramayana, but a translation of the Adhyatma Ramayana, a Sanskrit text connected with the Ramanandi sect. The poem is composed in nearly-modern Malayalam. It depicts Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, as an ideal figure (both as man and god- incarnate, the Bhakri interpretation). The text spread with phenomenal popularity throughout Kerala middle-caste homes as a material for domestic devotional recitation. Throughout the Malayalam month of Karkkidakam, Adhyatma Ramayanam is still recited—as a devotional practice—in the middle-caste homes of Kerala. According to critic K. Ayyappa Panicker, those who see Adhyatma Ramayanam merely as a devotional work \\"belittle\\" Ezhuthachan.  Style  =Parrot-song style= * Known in Malayalam as the Kilippattu genre. * A convention Ezhuthachan adapted from Old Tamil. * Recited to a poet by a parrot (the frame of the parrot-narrator). * Thematic focus: epic or Puranic traditions. * Intended for recitation or singing. Lexicon and grammar * Heavily Sanskritic lexicon with many Sanskrit nominal terminations (lexical distinctions between Manipravalam and the Pattu styles are not visible). * No Sanskrit verbal forms or long compounds. * Most of the grammatical structures are in Malayalam (the frame of the parrot-narrator and the constituent meters). * Assembled in an array of Dravidian meters (in simple metrical couplets). ** \\"Keka\\" for Bala Kandha and Aranya Kandha ** \\"Kakali\\" for Ayodhya, Kishkindha and Yuddha Kandha ** \\"Kalakanchi\\" for Sundara Kandha  Caste  Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan's caste is arguable. It is only known that he belonged to a lower caste (Shudra or Shudra-grade). The two most popular opinions are Ezhuthachan and Nair, with Kaniyar being less popular. = Ezhuthachan = Ezhuthachan caste is a socio-economic caste of village school teachers. According to Arthur C. Burnell, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan belonged to the Ezhuthachan or \\"school master\\" caste. Writer K. Balakrishna Kurup also reports the same, in his book Viswasathinte Kanappurangal. E. P. Bhaskara Guptan, a writer and independent researcher of local history from Kadampazhipuram; supports Kurup's conclusion. Historian Velayudhan Panikkassery expresses the same opinion. = Nair = The Chakkala Nair caste had the rights to enter brahmanical temples and to participate in worships. The Malayalam poet and historian Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer agree that Ezhuthachan belonged to this caste and conclude that he could be Vattekattu Nair because he visited brahmanical temples and engaged in worship, which is not allowed for the Ezuthacan caste. William Logan, officer of the Madras Civil Service under the English India Company Government, expresses a similar opinion in his Malabar Manual and states that Thunchaththu Ezuthachan was \\"a man of Sudra (Nayar) caste\\". Kottarathil Shankunni wrote in his Aithihyamala that the term Ezhuthachan is nothing but a title taken up by school teachers belonging to several castes mainly by Nairs in Northern kerala indicating that Ezhuthachan was a Nair. = Kaniyar = Some sources consider him to be Kaniyar. This community of traditional astrologers were well versed in Sanskrit and Malayalam. During the medieval period, when non-Brahmins were not permitted to learn Sanskrit, only the Kaniyar community had been traditionally enjoying the privilege for accessing and acquiring knowledge in Sanskrit, through their hereditary system of pedagogy. They were learned people and had knowledge in astrology, mathematics, mythology and Ayurveda. They were generally assigned as preceptors of martial art and literacy. In addition to the common title Panicker, the members of Kaniyar from the South Travancore and Malabar region were known as Aasaan, Ezhuthu Aasans, or Ezhuthachans (Father of Letters), by virtue of their traditional avocational function as village school masters to non-Brahmin pupils.  Legacy  Strychnine tree in Thunchan Parambu, Tirur The parrot-song genre, pioneered by Ezhuthachan, inaugurated the production of many similar works in Malayalam. The highest literary honour awarded by the Government of Kerala is known as the \\"Ezhuthachan Puraskaram\\". Sooranad Kunjan Pillai was the first recipient of the honour (1993). The Malayalam University, established by Kerala Government in 2012, is named after Ezhuthachan. = Initiation to Letters = The sand from the compound where the house of Ezhuthachan stood once is considered as sacred. It is a tradition in north Kerala to practise the art of writing in the beginning on the sand with the first finger. = Monuments = * Ezhuthachan was born at Trikkandiyoor in northern Kerala. His birthplace is now known as Thunchan Parambu. * Chittur Gurumadhom is located near present- day Palakkad. The madhom is flanked by temples of gods Rama and Siva. The street has an array of agraharas (where the twelve Brahmin families who migrated along with Ezhuthachan live). * Ezhuthachan's samadhi is also situated at Chittur (in Palakkad). = Relics = * Some relics of Ezhuthachan or his age were sacredly preserved at the Chittur madhom. This included the original manuscripts and the clogs used by him. These artifacts were destroyed in a fire 30 or 40 years before William Logan. Only the Bhagavatam was saved from the fire. * Scholar A. C. Burnell examined this Bhagavatam (and a stool, clogs and a staff) in the late 19th century. These objects probably belongd to one of the first followers of Ezhuthachan. * Stool, clog and the staff (seen by Burnell) were destroyed in a second fire. This fire destroyed the original Bhagavatam also. * Copies of a sri chakra and the idols worshipped by Ezhuthachan, the stylus, the wooden slippers, and a few old manuscripts are exhibited for visitors at Chittur madhom.

These are directional quantities. The SI unit of radiant intensity is the watt per steradian (), while that of spectral intensity in frequency is the watt per steradian per hertz () and that of spectral intensity in wavelength is the watt per steradian per metre ()—commonly the watt per steradian per nanometre (). Radiant intensity is distinct from irradiance and radiant exitance, which are often called intensity in branches of physics other than radiometry. In radio-frequency engineering, radiant intensity is sometimes called radiation intensity. Mathematical definitions =Radiant intensity= Radiant intensity, denoted Ie,Ω (\\"e\\" for \\"energetic\\", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities, and \\"Ω\\" to indicate this is a directional quantity), is defined as :I_{mathrm{e},Omega} = frac{partial Phi_mathrm{e}}{partial Omega}, where *∂ is the partial derivative symbol; *Φe is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received; *Ω is the solid angle. In general, Ie,Ω is a function of viewing angle θ and potentially azimuth angle. For the special case of a Lambertian surface, Ie,Ω follows the Lambert's cosine law Ie,Ω = I0 cos θ. When calculating the radiant intensity emitted by a source, Ω refers to the solid angle into which the light is emitted. When calculating radiance received by a detector, Ω refers to the solid angle subtended by the source as viewed from that detector. =Spectral intensity= Spectral intensity in frequency, denoted Ie,Ω,ν, is defined as :I_{mathrm{e},Omega, u} = frac{partial I_{mathrm{e},Omega}}{partial u}, where ν is the frequency. Spectral intensity in wavelength, denoted Ie,Ω,λ, is defined as :I_{mathrm{e},Omega,lambda} = frac{partial I_{mathrm{e},Omega}}{partial lambda}, where λ is the wavelength. Radio- frequency engineering Radiant intensity is used to characterize the emission of radiation by an antenna: :I_{mathrm{e},Omega} = E_mathrm{e}(r) , r^2, where *Ee is the irradiance of the antenna; *r is the distance from the antenna. Unlike power density, radiant intensity does not depend on distance: because radiant intensity is defined as the power through a solid angle, the decreasing power density over distance due to the inverse-square law is offset by the increase in area with distance.

The first album following their 1988 breakthrough The Trinity Session, The Caution Horses features a more conventional, polished sound than the earlier album's spare, haunting country blues. As a consequence, the album received average reviews from music critics, who said that the band had sacrificed their distinctive style.  Reception  However, the album's accessibility to mainstream pop and rock audiences also meant that it received more radio airplay and spawned bigger chart hits (\\"Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning\\" and \\"Rock and Bird\\", which featured Bruce Hornsby on the piano on the single version) than The Trinity Session had. A number of critics have also noted that while the album is undeniably a disappointment when compared to its predecessor, when taken on its own merits it is a better album than its initial reception would suggest. The album focuses on the band's slow, languorous style, a style that has been called simplistic, or narcoleptic, or uncategorizable. Margo states \\"It's not country, it's not blues, it's not rock, we just do what we do.\\" The album peaked at number 47 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and number 33 on the UK Charts.  Album development  = The Sharon Temple sessions = The band decided to record in a live setting as they had on The Trinity Session. This time they chose the Sharon Temple, a National Historic Site north of Toronto, as their studio. The recording proved challenging, as they had to adapt to the unique acoustics of the Sharon Temple and also the cool temperatures of a Canadian spring (they were not allowed to bring heaters into this unheated building due to its heritage designations). The cover of the album shows the band outside of this historic building. The intent of the recording was to use a single ambisonic mike like the one used for The Trinity Session, but this time Peter Moore was unfamiliar with the building, and the songs the band had written were more lush, which created recording problems, such as the music spilling over into Margo's vocal mic and causing feedback. Of the three days for the recording, the first two days were spent solving the musical challenges, and fighting the cold temperatures. Moore explained to the band why cold temperatures were perfect to record in, and the band explained to Moore that cold temperatures negatively affected human anatomy, and prolonged exposure caused extremities such as fingers to stop working. On the third day, the sound problems were resolved, both by configuring the band around the microphone, and also by banishing Margo to a far corner of the building in a small makeshift sound booth made of baffles and sound blankets which they named the \\"witches hut\\". For the rest of their last day there, they made and recorded their music, and when the closed up, they were happy that they had some decent recordings, if not anything special. A few days later, they listened to the recordings, and decided to call it good. The band called the record company, and told them their album was finished. The record company executives told the band that the results were not what they were hoping for. However the company was patient with the band, and everyone agreed to live with the material for a while before deciding anything. While the Cowboy Junkies were touring Europe, they worked the new songs into their sets. As they played the songs, the songs changed and matured. When they came back they re-listened to the Sharon tapes and agreed that the tracks were not what they wanted to release, and they decided to re-record the music. = The Caution Horses sessions = When the band returned to Toronto, they made a decision to go to Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto, and find a new way to record their sound. The band really liked the one-mic sound, but wanted to take advantage of the multi-track equipment at the studio. Moore arranged the group around a mic, and spent a fair amount of time balancing the sound, but at the same time they placed individual mics on each instrument to capture each individual performance on a separate track, allowing them to augment the sound of the central mic as needed. The recording arrangement allowed them to capture the intimacy of live recordings. The sessions went relatively smoothly, they just rolled tape and played over a handful of days in December. Because of using multiple mics and tracks, for the first time the band had created an album which had to be mixed. The band felt they were too close to the material, so they brought in an outsider to mix the music. When they listened to the results, they trashed the mixes and decided to redo them themselves, spending a couple of weeks in the studio with Moore and their engineer, Tom Henderson.

He was a naval theorist and admiral. He was instrumental during the Revolutions of 1848 in founding the first unified German fleet, the Reichsflotte. During the 1850s he helped to establish the Prussian Navy. Biography Adalbert was born in Berlin, the son of Prince William, the youngest brother of King Frederick William III. As a young man, Adalbert entered the Prussian army and served in the artillery. Several journeys led him between 1826 and 1842 to the Netherlands, Britain, Russia, Turkey, Greece and Brazil. He recognized during his many sea voyages the importance that sea power had for a modern commercial and industrial nation. He studied carefully the theory of naval warfare and in 1835-36 wrote a first plan for the construction of a Prussian fleet. Prussia at that time was a land power focused on Continental Europe, possessing practically no navy of its own; rather, it relied on the allied powers of Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. During the First Schleswig War of 1848-51, however, the failure of this strategy became apparent: Britain and the Netherlands remained neutral and Denmark became the enemy. Within a few days the Danish navy had destroyed German maritime commerce in the North Sea and the Baltic. During the Revolutions of 1848, the German National Assembly which met at St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt resolved with \\"a majority clearly bordering on unanimity\\" to establish a German Imperial fleet and named Prince Adalbert to lead the Maritime Technical Commission. He presented his recommendations in a \\"Memorandum on the Construction of a German Fleet\\" (Denkschrift über die Bildung einer deutschen Flotte) (Potsdam, 1848). In this memorandum, still regarded highly for its insights on naval strategy, Adalbert distinguished between three fleet models: *A naval force intended solely for defensive actions in relation to coastal defense; *An offensive naval force intended for national defense, and for the most necessary protection of commerce; or *An independent naval power. Adalbert favored the middle solution, because it would not provoke the great sea powers (such as Britain), but would provide the German navy with significant value as an ally. In 1849 his cousin, King Frederick William IV, ordered Adalbert to resign his office in the fledgling Imperial Navy. The reactionary king mistrusted the National Assembly because of its revolutionary nature, and had already turned down its offer to assume the German Imperial crown. Despite the setback, Adalbert continued to give active support to the construction of a fleet. In 1852 Adalbert argued that Prussia needed to build a naval base on the North Sea. He arranged the Jade Treaty of 20 July 1853, in which Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg jointly withdrew from a region on the west bank of the Jade bay, where from 1854 onward Prussia established the fortress, naval base and city of Wilhelmshaven. On 30 March 1854, Adalbert was named Admiral of the Prussian Coast and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. In the summer of 1856, while on a training cruise of Prussian warships, he was shot at by pirates within sight of Morocco's Rif coast and was wounded. During the Second Schleswig War of 1864 (also known as the \\"Danish-Prussian War\\") he commanded the Baltic Squadron, without being able to take an active role in the war. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, which led to the creation of the German Empire, Adalbert laid down his title of \\"Prince-Admiral\\" and retired from the now-renamed Imperial Navy. He died two years later of liver disease, aged 62, in Karlsbad. Adalbert was married to the dancer Therese Elssler (Frau von Barnim); their only son, Adalbert v. Barnim (born 22 April 1841), died in July 1860 during an expedition on the Nile.

Personal life Renouf was born in Guernsey on the Channel Islands on 23 August 1822. He married Ludovica von Brentano, member of a well-known German literary family in 1857. He died in London on .  Education  Renouf was educated at Elizabeth College there, and proceeded to Oxford, which, upon his becoming a Roman Catholic, under the influence of John Henry Newman, he quit without taking a degree as he was unable to subscribe to the Thirty Nine Articles as required in those days.The Letters of Peter le Page Renouf (1822-1897), edited by Kevin J. Cathcart, 4 vols. (University College Dublin Press, 2002-2004), reviewed by Patricia Usick (British Museum), retrieved 25 May 2009  Religious background  Like many other Anglican converts, he proved a thorn in the side of the Ultramontane party in the Roman Church, though he did not, like some of them, return to the communion of the Church of England. He opposed the promulgation of the dogma of Papal Infallibility, and his treatise (1868) upon the condemnation of Pope Honorius for heresy by the council of Constantinople in AD 680 was placed upon the index of prohibited books.  Career  = Professorship = He had been from 1855 to 1864 professor of ancient history and Oriental languages in the Roman Catholic university which Newman vainly strove to establish in Dublin, and during part of this period edited the Atlantis and the Home and Foreign Review, which latter had to be discontinued on account of the hostility of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Renouf was one of the defenders of Champollion and of his method of decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics in England when he was being criticized unfairly by other scholars. = Museum directorship = In 1864 he was appointed a government inspector of schools, which position he held until 1886, when his growing celebrity as an Egyptologist procured him the appointment of Keeper of Oriental Antiquities in the British Museum, in succession to Dr Samuel Birch. His understudy was E. A. Wallis Budge with whom he had an acrimonious relationship. He didn't want Budge to succeed him as keeper, through a perceived lack of social skills (Budge didn't come from a privileged background) and doubts about his abilities, objecting strongly to Budge being appointed as his successor and preferring Edouard Naville instead. Renouf was elected in 1887 president of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, to whose Proceedings he was a constant contributor. Renouf was removed from his position as Keeper in the British Museum on reaching retirement age despite the signed opposition of twenty-five leading European Egyptologists of the day who wrote to the Prime Minister. Renouf gave \\"excoriating evidence in court against Budge\\" when the latter was found to have \\"falsely accused Hormuzd Rassam of being corruptly involved in illicit trade of cuneiform tablets.\\" Renouf continued to feel animosity towards Budge, accusing him of plagiarism and being a charlatan.  Academic works  The most important of his contributions to Egyptology are his Hibbert Lectures on The Religion of the Egyptians, delivered in 1879; and the translation of The Book of the Dead, with an ample commentary, published in the Transactions of the society over which he presided. He retired from the Museum under the superannuation rule in 1891 and was knighted for services to the British Museum in 1896. His letters show unstinting praise for Renouf's scholarship from all the leading Egyptologists of his day.

The malong is traditionally used as a garment by both men and women of the numerous ethnic groups in the mainland Mindanao and parts of the Sulu Archipelago. They are wrapped around at waist or chest-height and secured by tucked ends, with belts of braided material or other pieces of cloth, or are knotted over one shoulder. They were traditionally hand-woven, with the patterns usually distinctive to a particular ethnic group. However, modern malong are usually machine-made or even imported, with patterns that mimic the traditional local designs. Description Handwoven malongs are made by Maranao, Maguindanao, and T'boli weavers on a backstrap loom. The pattern or style of the malong may indicate the weaver's tribal origin, such as the Maranao malong landap. Very rare malong designs and styles can indicate the village in which the malong was made, for example, the extremely intricate malong rawatan made only by a handful of Maranao weavers in Lanao del Sur, Mindanao. Handwoven malongs, which are costly, are likely to be used only at social functions, to display the social and economic status of the wearer. While modern malongs are made of cotton and Lurex threads, some contemporary handwoven malongs are made of inexpensive rayon thread, to reduce the manufacturing cost to the weaver and ultimate cost to the consumer. There are many grades of cotton thread, and the cost of a malong can also be reduced by using the lesser grades of cotton thread, or by creating a loose or coarse weave. Machine-made printed cotton malongs are made in Indonesia specifically for export to the Philippines, and are commonly referred to as \\"batik\\" because the item is imported; those inexpensive machine-made malongs are used for everyday purposes. The designs of traditional handwoven designs are used in imported cotton from Thailand, allowing the purchaser to have a cotton machine-printed malong which, from a distance, convincingly mimics the look of a much more expensive handwoven malong. Uses The malong can function as a skirt for both men and women, a turban, Niqab, Hijab, a dress, a blanket, a sunshade, a bedsheet, a \\"dressing room\\", a hammock, a prayer mat, and other purposes. A newborn is wrapped in a malong, and as he grows this piece of cloth becomes a part of his daily life. When he dies, he is once again wrapped in a malong. Among traditional tribal peoples, the malong is used in everyday life. Even in areas where people wear Western-style clothing during the day, the malong is commonly used as sleepwear. The malong is also used in very big festivals, they wear this to show respect. Two are represented in the Ayala Museum Collection: The \\"malong a andon\\" on the left, and the \\"malong a landap\\" on the right. Similar clothing Similar wraparound skirts were also worn by other Filipino ethnic groups in the pre-colonial period, like the identical Visayan and Tausug patadyong and the shorter Tagalog tapis. However, most of these later evolved into a component of the baro't saya worn over a longer skirt (the saya or falda) due to Spanish influence. Some of them survive among more isolated highlander groups like among the Ifugao people. The malong and other Philippine wraparound skirts are related to the sarong worn by peoples in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, and Indonesia), as well as the barkcloth skirts worn by other Austronesian peoples like the direct Polynesian cognate malo or lavalava.

It arises in the case of a Yang–Mills theory with a gauge group G, coupled to a Higgs field which spontaneously breaks it down to a smaller group H via the Higgs mechanism. It was first found independently by Gerard 't Hooft and Alexander Polyakov. Unlike the Dirac monopole, the 't Hooft–Polyakov monopole is a smooth solution with a finite total energy. The solution is localized around r=0. Very far from the origin, the gauge group G is broken to H, and the 't Hooft–Polyakov monopole reduces to the Dirac monopole. However, at the origin itself, the G gauge symmetry is unbroken and the solution is non-singular also near the origin. The Higgs field :H_i qquad (i=1,2,3) , is proportional to :x_i f(x) , where the adjoint indices are identified with the three- dimensional spatial indices. The gauge field at infinity is such that the Higgs field's dependence on the angular directions is pure gauge. The precise configuration for the Higgs field and the gauge field near the origin is such that it satisfies the full Yang–Mills–Higgs equations of motion. Mathematical details Suppose the vacuum is the vacuum manifold Σ. Then, for finite energies, as we move along each direction towards spatial infinity, the state along the path approaches a point on the vacuum manifold Σ. Otherwise, we would not have a finite energy. In topologically trivial 3 + 1 dimensions, this means spatial infinity is homotopically equivalent to the topological sphere S. So, the superselection sectors are classified by the second homotopy group of Σ, π2(Σ). In the special case of a Yang–Mills–Higgs theory, the vacuum manifold is isomorphic to the quotient space G/H and the relevant homotopy group is π2(G/H). Note that this doesn't actually require the existence of a scalar Higgs field. Most symmetry breaking mechanisms (e.g. technicolor) would also give rise to a 't Hooft–Polyakov monopole. It's easy to generalize to the case of d + 1 dimensions. We have πd−1(Σ). Monopole problem The \\"monopole problem\\" refers to the cosmological implications of grand unification theories (GUT). Since monopoles are generically produced in GUT during the cooling of the universe, and since they are expected to be quite massive, their existence threatens to overclose it. This is considered a \\"problem\\" within the standard Big Bang theory. Cosmic inflation remedies the situation by diluting any primordial abundance of magnetic monopoles.

Whilst in Australia, Alley was also a middleweight boxer, and was undefeated in 28 contests when he was forced to give it up after being hit on the head in the nets at cricket practice. His cricket career was interrupted and delayed both by his boxing career, and by World War Two, which saw first class cricket matches cancelled for 6 years. He was tipped to play Tests by Don Bradman, the Australian cricket captain, but missed out after fracturing a jaw. This prompted him to leave New South Wales and come to Lancashire, England, playing league cricket there for Colne Cricket Club for five years from 1948, becoming the only player to score 1000 runs in each of five consecutive seasons in the league's history. This 5-year spell at Colne fulfilled the requirement at that time that any foreign player coming to England had to reside in England for 5 years before he could play first-class cricket in England. From Colne he moved to play for Blackpool CC in the newly established Northern League where he scored 19 centuries. As the professional for Blackpool, he was able to earn more money than any first class cricketer anywhere in the world. Each League side in Lancashire was permitted to pay only one professional. During the 1950s and early 1960s, in the summer at any one time there were more than 150,000 holidaymakers in Blackpool, and there were very large crowds indeed paying at the turnstiles of Blackpool Cricket Club. Every season, moreover, the Blackpool pro was given a benefit match. Illustrating the value of the Blackpool job, Alley was succeeded as Blackpool's pro by many of the all-time greats of the game. These included Sir Conrad Hunte, Garfield Sobers, Pankaj Roy, Hanif Mohammad and Rohan Kanhai. Playing only 2 days a week would also have given the pro the opportunity to take a second job if he had so wanted, including playing for a Minor County or a first class County Second Eleven. Alley was eventually tempted into joining Somerset CCC in 1957, when he was 38, since they offered a 3-year contract, while Blackpool could not commit to one of such length. Alley played 350 first-class games for Somerset, the last one being when he was 49. After stopping playing, he umpired first-class games for 16 years and also stood in 10 Test matches and 9 One Day Internationals as umpire. He so loved the West Country area of England that he chose to remain there after retirement rather than move back to his native Australia. Alley was married to Betty, whom he met when playing cricket in the north of England, and they had two sons. His first wife died in childbirth; they had a son, who died in an Army accident. Record in first-class cricket Alley was an all-rounder. He scored 19,612 runs at an average of 31.88 batting left-handed. He took 768 wickets at 22.68 runs per wicket, with a best of 8 for 65, bowling right arm medium fast. He also took 267 catches in the field. His best season was his testimonial season in 1961 when, at the age of forty-two, he scored over 3,000 runs for Somerset and in one match achieved his highest score of 221 not out, out of Somerset's total of 311 all out. During the same season he hit in excess of 300 runs in a match against the visiting Australians (184 not out in the first innings and 134 not out in the second innings). His was the last instance of a batsman scoring 3000 in an English season. Only eight batsmen in history have achieved the feat of 3000 runs in an English season. At the end of that season, he topped the first-class averages, ahead of all the England and Australian Test cricketers, who in those days all played among the Counties six days a week throughout the season except when they were playing Test cricket. Alley's 10 centuries for Somerset in 1961 remained a county record for thirty years. In 1962 he received the honour of being one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year, based on his performances in 1961 and during his career. In the 1962 season, he made over 1,900 runs and took 112 wickets. It was in 1962 that he got his best bowling return of 8 for 65 against a strong Surrey side, that included Ken Barrington, Peter May and Bernie Constable.

With a maximum depth of , it is the deepest lake in Louisiana. It was a freshwater body, popular with sportsmen, until an unusual man-made disaster on November 20, 1980 changed its structure and the surrounding land. Drilling disaster On Thursday, November 20, 1980, the Diamond Crystal Salt Company salt mine under the lake filled with water. An oil rig contracted by Texaco was doing exploratory drilling above the mine at the time. The drilling likely started a chain of events that turned the shallow lake from fresh to brackish water, with a deep hole. The evidence which could be used to identify the exact cause was destroyed or washed away in the ensuing maelstrom. However, the rig's drill bit had become stuck just two-and-a-half hours before the draining was first observed. After the fact, engineers from Texaco and Diamond Crystal worked together to pinpoint the likely location of the hole which may have pierced the mine. They placed it within a mined out portion of the 1300-foot level of the mine. If the drill actually did puncture the roof of the mine, this would mean that Texaco had made a serious mistake about the location of the bore hole in relation to the mine. Whatever the precise cause, an opening formed in the bottom of the lake. The lake then drained into the hole, expanding the size of that hole as the soil and salt were washed into the mine by the rushing water, filling the enormous caverns that had been left by the removal of salt since 1919. The backwards flow of the normally outflowing Delcambre Canal temporarily created the biggest waterfall in Louisiana The resultant sinkhole swallowed the drilling platform, eleven barges holding supplies for the drilling operation, a tugboat, many trees, and of the surrounding terrain. So much water drained into the caverns that the flow of the Delcambre Canal that usually empties the lake into Vermilion Bay was reversed, causing salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to flow into what was now a dry lakebed. This backflow created for a few days the tallest waterfall ever in the state of Louisiana, at , as the lake refilled with salty water from the Delcambre Canal and Vermilion Bay. Air displaced by water flowing into the mine caverns erupted through the mineshafts as compressed air and then later as geysers. Although no human lives were lost, three dogs were reported killed. All 55 employees in the mine at the time of the accident were able to escape, with six employees later given awards by Diamond Crystal for heroism. The crew of 7 on the drilling rig fled the platform shortly before it collapsed into the new depths of the lake. A fisherman who was on the lake at the time was able to pilot his small boat to shore and escape. Days after the disaster, once the water pressure equalized, nine of the eleven sunken barges popped out of the whirlpool and refloated on the lake's surface. =Aftermath= Texaco and the drilling contractor Wilson Brothers paid $32 million to Diamond Crystal and $12.8 million to a nearby botanical garden and plant nursery, Live Oak Gardens, in out-of-court settlements to compensate for the damage caused. The Mine Safety and Health Administration released a report on the disaster in August 1981 which exhaustively documented the event but stopped short of identifying an official reason for the disaster. The mine was finally closed in December 1986. Since 1994, AGL Resources has used Lake Peigneur's underlying salt dome as a storage and hub facility for pressurized natural gas.Jefferson Island Storage and Hub Q & A AGL resources, 2007, (map of lake showing current and planned gas caverns) There was concern from local residents in 2009 over the safety of storing the gas under the lake and nearby drilling operations. =Salinity= The lake had salty water after the event, not as a result of salt from the mine dissolving into the water, but from the inflow of salty water from the Delcambre Canal and Vermilion Bay, which are naturally salty or brackish. The event permanently affected the ecosystem of the lake by changing the lake from freshwater to saltwater and increasing the depth of part of the lake.

Mendrisio is the seat of the Accademia di Architettura of the university of Italian-speaking Switzerland (USI). The municipality was boosted in size on 4 April 2004 when it incorporated the former municipality of Salorino. On 5 April 2009 it incorporated the former municipalities of Arzo, Capolago, Genestrerio, Rancate and Tremona. On 14 April 2013 the former municipalities of Besazio, Ligornetto and Meride merged into the municipality of Mendrisio.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 19 April 2013 Mendrisio is served by Mendrisio railway station. History Classicist Church of SS. Cosma e Damiano Casa Croci, a villa built in 1873 as the town grew wealthy from factories. Mendrisio was first mentioned in 793 as Mendrici and was also known by its German name, Mendris though this name is no longer used. However, the area was inhabited during the Roman era. Around thirty tombs, a villa and coins from a Roman settlement have been discovered in the area. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Mendrisio was the center of a Lombard district and grew into a town. During the Middle Ages, several fortifications were built on the valley floor between the Porta S. Giovanni and the Moree river. In the Late Middle Ages the Torriani family built their castle on the rocky hills above the town. Mendrisio became an independent town in the County of Seprio in 1140. The County was taken over by Como three decades later in 1170. Como ruled over Mendrisio until 1335, when Como was brought under Milan's control. Mendrisio then remained under Milanese control until 1402. At some point in the 15th century, the town was given as a fief to the Rusca and Sanseverino families. In the late 15th and early 16th century, the Swiss Confederation canton of Uri began expanding down into the Leventina valley. After a number of setbacks, by 1512 Uri and the rest of the Confederation captured the city of Lugano and incorporated the Landvogtei of Mendrisio. Nine years later, in 1521, the Swiss Confederation established a system of shared responsibility over the Italian Bailiwicks and appointed a bailiff to manage Mendrisio. Mendrisio remained a conquered territory with limited autonomy and rights until the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic. Despite Mendrisio's early growth, it remained a part of the large parish of Balerna until the 15th century. Over the following years, two parishes were formed in the town, under the parish churches of SS Cosma e Damiano and S. Sisinio. The Church of SS Cosma e Damiano was built in the Baroque style in 1672. The first building was demolished in the 19th century and a new Classicist style church was built nearby in 1863–75. The church of S. Sisino was built outside the town in the village of La Torre. A number of religious orders also settled in Mendrisio, including the Humiliati, the Servite Order, the Ursulines and the Capuchins. The Servites established a boys school in 1644 in the Convent of S. Giovanni. In 1852 that school became a cantonal secondary school. During the 19th century the religious orders' convents and monasteries were all secularized. In the past century, the town has expanded away from the Moree river and developed a large industrial sector. During the late 19th century, one of the first factories in town, the Torriani-Bolzani spinning mill employed about 350 women and children (over 10% of the population in 1900). The factories brought jobs to the town and encouraged villagers to move into Mendrisio. The population doubled over the last 60 years of the 19th century. Wealthy industrialists built large villas and the Beata Vergine hospital. The construction of a railroad through the town brought more residents and industry. During the 20th century, a number of service companies opened in the town and industry began to decline. In 2000 almost three-quarters of the working population worked in the services sector. Mendrisio's location near the Italian border means that many of the residents and workers are cross-border commuters. As a district capital, Mendrisio provides services for the surrounding communities. A neuro-psychiatric clinic was opened in 1898. This was followed by primary and secondary schools in 1944 and in 1996 the School of Architecture of the Università della Svizzera italiana opened.

The album continues the band's evolution from a spare country blues style (exemplified by the 1988 album The Trinity Session) to a more mainstream country rock style.  Album development  The Cowboy Junkies approach each album looking to see where they can change or improve. With Black Eyed Man Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts. Margo wanted to expand her singing style and her range. Michael states \\"We also wanted to approach each song individually rather than the whole album being one long song. I wanted this one to have different perspectives in each song.\\" Another change the band made was to record the album over several months instead of in one session. They also decided to try using a new mixture of musicians, instruments, and recording personnel. The band concentrated on two or three songs at a time instead of the album as a whole. Each month they would write and arrange song ideas for the first three weeks, and then on the final week would head into the studio at Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. One musical choice was to make the album diverse in its arrangements, unlike The Caution Horses. Each song would have its own unique collection of musicians. The theme to hold the album together was \\"the lyrical theme of love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man,\\" according to Michael Timmins. The band experimented with each track. Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to consider including in the album. Many of the songs were minimally rehearsed if at all, in an attempt to capture the freshness and spontaneity. Several musical ideas did not work, but some of the rejected attempts lead the band to try different sounds and directions. One example is \\"Murder, Tonight, in the Trailer Park\\", which blended the jazz guitar sensibilities of Tony Quarington with the guitar work of Ken Mhyr to develop a song that was different than was first envisioned. When the Cowboy Junkies were touring for The Caution Horses in 1990, they invited American singer/songwriter Townes Van Zandt to tour with them. During the tour, Van Zandt wrote \\"Cowboy Junkies Lament\\" especially for the band. Michael Timmins returned the favor, penning \\"Townes' Blues\\" as a tribute to Van Zandt. The band also cover Van Zandt's \\"To Live is to Fly\\" at the end of the album. John Prine appears as a guest vocalist on \\"If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man.\\" The band had initially asked Jimmie Dale Gilmore to duet with Margo, but although he showed up and recorded with the band, his voice was never able to mesh with Margo's.

He served in Korea at the end of the Joseon Dynasty, becoming close to the emperor. At his suggestion, in 1885 the emperor founded the institution that became known as Severance Hospital in Seoul (now in South Korea). It is now part of the Yonsei University Health System. Due to Allen's relationship with the emperor and other officials, Allen became part of the United States Legation to Korea: he was appointed as secretary in 1890 and as US minister and consul general in 1897. Due to disagreements with the US government over its lack of intervention in the Russo-Japanese War, Allen was recalled in 1905. Five years later Japan annexed Korea, setting up a ruling government that lasted until the end of World War II and Japan's defeat by the Allies. Biography Horace Newton Allen was born in Delaware, Ohio on April 23, 1858. He received his B.S. at Ohio Wesleyan University in 1881. He studied medicine at the Miami Medical School in Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating in 1883. Allen was appointed a medical missionary and sent to China by the Board of Foreign Missions of the [Presbyterian Church in U.S.A] and arrived at Shanghai on October 11, 1883. After a while, he decided to serve in Korea which had just opened its doors to the western world. After obtaining the mission board's permission, he went to Korea on September 20, 1884 to explore. As government law prohibited foreign religion at the time, he was appointed medical officer of the United States Legation to Korea in Seoul, thus hiding his true identity. He went back to Shanghai to bring back his wife Francis \\"Fannie\\" and their son, Harry to Korea on October 26 (Allen's Diary-Archive Department of New York Public Library). On December 4, 1884 Gap Sin Jeong Byeon Gap Sin Emuete took place, a coup d'état staged with the help of the Japanese army by a handful of elite progressive officials who had toured the United States in the previous as a complement of the U.S. State Department. The progressive government collapsed in 3 days as the Chinese army entered Seoul and defeated the Japanese army. This event started with the assassination attempt on the life of the queens nephew, Min Young Ik, who was hosting a banquet to celebrate the opening of the nation's first postal office with dignitaries including foreign diplomats and he was inflicted with 7 severe sword wounds. Dr. Allen was summoned and treated Min's near mortal wounds, applying western medical methods against the objection of 14 of the court's medicine men. It is noted that wounds soon became infected and Dr. Allen treated the infected wounds with \\"baked mud\\" to absorb pus and wash away with water and it took 3 months before Dr. Allen's treatment on him was completed.Allen's Diary Upon hearing the wide spread rumor that a foreigner with bushy red beard revived a dead prince, many people flocked to his house. He seized this opportunity to serve Korean people and submitted to the Foreign Ministry \\"A proposal of founding a hospital for the government of His Majesty in Seoul Corea\\" with an introductory letter by J. C. Foulk, charge de' affair of the U.S. Legation. The king Gojong granted his proposal readily and a western hospital named Gwang hye Won (廣惠院, House of Extended Grace) was opened in a traditional Korean estate on April 10, 1885. The name quickly was changed to Chejungwon 제중원 the House of Universal Helpfulness. The hospital had 5 separate in-patient rooms, eye treatment room for extraction of cataracts, vaccination room for smallpox, etc. A year later, Dr. Allen, John William Heron and Horace Underwood opened a medical school \\"Medical and Scientific School of Royal Corean Hospital and admitted 16 medical students. The adjoining school building had a large class room, a chemistry lab and 2 dormitory rooms. It is noteworthy that since September 1894 the Board of Foreign Mission started to operate the nation's first western hospital and medical school in Korea and in September 1904 Chejungwon built a new ultra modern brick building outside the South Gate with help from Louis Severance, a philanthropist in Cleveland Ohio, moving patients from \\"the old to new buildings\\" on September 23. The invitation to the dedication of the building read \\"the New Chejungwon/Severance Hospital\\". For a while after the transition the popular daily newspaper Donga Ilbo called the new hospital \\"New Chejungwon\\" and government official document also referred the new hospital as Shin Chejungwon (New Chejungwon). The newly renamed Severance Hospital was the direct descendant of Chejungwon.letter by Dr. Jesse Hurst and 이하영 서신 규장각 The Severance Hospital and Medical school on June 5, 1962 moved to a new location in Sinchon after building a huge medical complex which included the Eighth U.S. Army Memorial Chest Hospital as an integral part and a separate unit ($400,000 worth of building material and $70,000 for medical equipment as American Forces Aids to Korea Program 1955). This institution now is called Yonsei Health System, part of Yonsei University after union with Yonsei University on Jan 5, 1957.documents from letters to Dr. Ernest Weiss from U. S. Eighth Army Allen's post Chejungwon activities related to Korea are; King Gojong of Korea asked Allen to help open the Korea Legation in United States of America and Allen led a 12-man delegation to Washington D. C. in November 1887 and established the Korean Legation in January 1888 when Minister Park J. Y presented appointment letter to President Cleveland. Allen helped operate the Korean Legation and carried out diplomatic activities (his position was \\"foreign secretary\\" \\"참찬관\\" ). Upon his return from America he started working in July, 1890 as Secretary at the United States Legation in Seoul and left 15 years later in June 1905 as the Envoy Extraordinaire and the Minister Plenipotential before his successor Morgan closed the United States legation in November 1905. Allen was decorated 3 times by King Gojong and the last one, the highest Tae Guk Order was donated to Yonsei Health System in 2015 by his great granddaughter Lydia Allen. He died in Toledo, Ohio on December 11, 1932. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Toledo. Allen and his wife, Francis Ann \\"Fannie\\", had two sons, Horace Ethan \\"Harry\\" who in turn had 3 sons and Maurice who left no children. There are 5 surviving great grandchildren.

She is a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University and has a doctorate in international politics from Aberystwyth University. She is also a Fellow of the Rothermere American Institute and a distinguished Scholar at the American University Center for Global Peace in Washington D.C. She received Jamnalal Bajaj International Award in 2003. In 2009 she was awarded the El-Hibri Peace Education Prize. In May 2011, her alma mater Ohio Wesleyan University awarded her a doctor of laws (honorary) degree.  Biography  After graduating college, King became a staff member for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She wrote a book on that four-year experience, Freedom Song: A Personal Story of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and won a Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award for it. King's participation in the Civil Rights Movement prompted her to co-write essays on women's issues with fellow activist Casey Hayden, most notably Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo (1965), which criticized sexism within the civil rights movement. Sara Evans attributes King and Hayden as founding activists for the women's liberation movement in her book \\"Personal Politics.\\" Evans claims that King and Hayden used their knowledge of participatory democracy, learned through SNCC membership, to critique women's position in a system of patriarchy. She says their essays stirred the beginning of women's liberation. Between 1968 and 1972 King worked for the federal government during the Johnson and Nixon administrations under the U.S. office of economic opportunity helping to set up neighborhood health services for America's rural and urban poor. And in 1974 King, with five other women, established the National Association of Women Business Owners. She was president of the Organization in 1976. King was appointed deputy director of the independent subcabinet federal agency that housed the Peace Corps, VISTA, and various programs of the ACTION agency under president Jimmy Carter. Mary resides with her husband, Dr. Peter G. Bourne, in Virginia in the United States and in Oxford in the United Kingdom.  Civil rights activism and feminism  Mary King joined the civil rights movement at the age of 22. She got her start in activism in college when she participated in a study tour across the south. On this tour in 1962 King and other students, both white and black, stayed at black colleges such as Fisk University, Clark College, and Tuskegee Institute. This group of students also visited white schools, such as Vanderbilt University, Agnes Scott College, and Georgia Tech. On the Study tour King was introduced to SNCC when she met John Lewis and Bernard Lafayette. Both of the men King met had been Freedom Riders and were affiliated with SNCC. Also on this study tour King met another student activist, Casey Hayden. Hayden would also become a staff member of SNCC and close friend to King. King marked this study tour as \\"a turning point in [her] life.\\" When King returned to Ohio Wesleyan University after her study tour she set up her own student organization. The organization she created was called The Student Committee on Race Relations (SCORR). With this organization, King linked together sixty students to change University policies; such as, Ohio Wesleyan's policy of rooming black freshman in single dorms or only with each other, along with the University's policies of limiting black enrollment. King graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in June 1962 and following in the same path as Casey Hayden Smith, Harold L. (2015). \\"Casey Hayden: Gender and the Origins of SNCC, SDS, and the Women's Liberation Movement\\". In Turner, Elizabeth Hayes; Cole, Stephanie; Sharpless, Rebecca (eds.). Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives. University of Georgia Press. pp. 295–318. . was introduced to civil rights activist, Ella Baker, through the Young Women's Christian Association in the southern region. Through this organization, Baker and professor Howard Zinn of Spelman College asked King to participate in their human-relations project. This project would involve King travelling with a recent black graduate to different colleges to assess the extent of academic freedom in the south. King agreed to participate. For this job King moved to Atlanta, Georgia and was partnered with a young black woman, Roberta Yanci \\"Bobbi.\\" As part of the project, King and Bobbi wrote and distributed a six-page newsletter, \\"Notes from the South.\\" The newsletter chronicled litigation, student direct action, token integration occurring on college campuses and on what SNCC was doing. The goal of the human-relations project was to help southern whites meet and know educated black counterparts from the same area, so that they could develop relationships with them as human beings. SNCC's office headquarters were also in Atlanta, so during the year that King worked for the human-relations project she also volunteered at SNCC, mostly doing office clerical work. Volunteering helped King establish connections with SNCC staff members, leading to her obtaining a staff position with the organization. In June 1963 when her job ended with the human-relations project, King began working for SNCC. She was to assist the organizations press secretary Julian Bond. After being hired by SNCC, King was sent to Danville, Virginia to run SNCC's communications operation there. She was to manage everything related to the information SNCC gave to the news media representatives in Danville. This role also made her the direct telephone link between SNCC's Danville office and its headquarters in Atlanta. In Danville King participated in protests against Danville mills. Protesters wanted fair employment policies at the mills and also led a boycott of Dan River Mills products. In July 1963, Leonard W. Holt, a black attorney, told King that she was about to be indicted for acts of violence and war by Danville courts; therefore, she needed to leave Danville. King fled to a Roman Catholic convent in North Carolina and eventually returned to SNCC headquarters in Atlanta only to be sent to Mississippi. King was sent to Mississippi to prepare a brochure and while there she encountered many leading activists for the Mississippi movement; such as Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses. By December 1963 King was back at SNCC headquarters in Atlanta, occasionally running its communications program under Julian Bond. While in Atlanta, King was arrested and jailed for participating in a lunch counter sit-in. King did communications work for SNCC in Atlanta between 1963 and 1964. Then between 1964 and 1965 her work was stationed in Jackson, Mississippi. The goals of communication were to create public and national awareness of the movement. Kings job entailed calling jails when activists were arrested, calling news media to give them stories about the movement, connecting SNCC offices to transfer news, and also help publish SNCC's newspaper, \\"The Student Voice.\\" King had been in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer project of 1964. After the summer project had ended a SNCC staff meeting was called to discuss the future of the organization. For this meeting King wrote two papers. One paper she wrote reflected on SNCC's need for a better communication system and how that need interfered with SNCC's lack of bureaucracy. The second paper King co-wrote with Casey Hayden, also in Mississippi with the SNCC. This paper addressed what it meant to be a woman SNCC staff member and the unequal treatment that resulted because of the patriarchal system. In King's words, it addressed the issue \\"of how my growing perception of myself as a woman might affect the structure and program of SNCC.\\" In 1965 King and Hayden expanded on this paper, elaborating on its central thesis that not only in society at large, but also within the civil rights movement itself, women are \\"caught\\" in a \\"common-law caste system\\" that limits their opportunity and voice. King and Hayden sent \\"Sex and Caste - A Kind of Memo\\" to forty women activists across the U.S. These women were involved in organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society, the National Student Association, the Northern Student Movement, the Student Peace Union, and SNCC. The document was subsequently published under the title \\"Sex and Caste\\"Sex and Caste - A Kind of Memo in the pacificst periodical Liberation, and entreated women to \\"start to talk with each other more openly.\\" In the summer of 1965 King began planning and conducting workshops to help movement volunteers remain active in civil rights issues once they went home. The workshops were \\"to discuss ways of using new skills, experiences, and lessons learned from community organizing in other parts of the country and in other phases of the movement.\\" In her autobiography, King describes feeling estranged from SNCC for various reasons. This estrangement led to her resignation from SNCC at the end of 1965.

It was originally written for Harrow School, but has also been adopted by many other schools including Wellington College, Wellington, Otahuhu College, Auckland, Netherthorpe School, Tormead School, Spalding Grammar School, Pretoria Boys High School, Nelson College, Napier Boys' High School, Woodford County High School for Girls, Colyton Grammar School, Bolton School Wroxall Abbey School and Beverley Grammar School. It is specifically about life at school, and is meant to give pupils now an idea of what it will be like in forty years when they return to their old school, and to remind old boys about their school life. It is the main school song of Harrow School, and is sung there at the end of any \\"Songs\\" - occasions when old boys of the school return to hear the schools songs being sung by current pupils, or an occasion within houses for singing the same songs at the end of each term - followed by \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and the British National Anthem (\\"God Save The Queen\\"). The \\"Churchill\\" verse, written to celebrate the life of the most famous Old Harrovian, Sir Winston Churchill is only sung once a year at a special Churchill Songs. Traditionally, verse three is sung by Old Harrovians in attendance at School Songs. The Churchill verse The penultimate Follow Up! in each chorus is sung unaccompanied by the School XII, which is made up of the best singers in the top year. \\"With the tramp of the twenty-two men\\" refers to the twenty-two players on the field during a game of Harrow football, a game that is ancestral to association football and played exclusively at Harrow School - this part may be likewise altered at other schools for other sports like rugby or football that may be more significant to the school. It inspired the title of (and is sung in) Forty Years On, a play by Alan Bennett. The song was also used in the films Young Winston (1972) and Never Let Me Go (2010). Lyrics Forty years on, when afar and asunder Parted are those who are singing today, When you look back, and forgetfully wonder What you were like in your work and your play, Then, it may be, there will often come o’er you, Glimpses of notes like the catch of a song – Visions of boyhood shall float them before you, Echoes of dreamland shall bear them along, Follow up! Follow up! Follow up Follow up! Follow up Till the field ring again and again, With the tramp of the twenty-two men. Follow up! Follow up! Routs and discomfitures, rushes and rallies, Bases attempted, and rescued, and won, Strife without anger and art without malice, – How will it seem to you, forty years on?

Oh the great days. in the distance enchanted, Days of fresh air, in the rain and the sun, How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted – Hardly believable, forty years on! How we discoursed of them, one with another, Auguring triumph, or balancing fate, Loved the ally with the heart of a brother, Hated the foe with a playing at hate! Follow up etc. Forty years on, growing older and older, Shorter in wind, as in memory long, Feeble of foot, and rheumatic of shoulder, What will it help you that once you were strong? God give us bases to guard or beleaguer, Games to play out, whether earnest or fun; Fights for the fearless, and goals for the eager, Twenty, and thirty, and forty years on! Follow up etc. Churchill Verse: Blazoned in honour! For each generation You kindled courage to stand and to stay; You led our fathers to fight for the nation, Called \\"Follow up\\" and yourself showed the way. We who were born in the calm after thunder Cherish our freedom to think and to do; If in our turn we forgetfully wonder, Yet we'll remember we owe it to you. Follow up! etc. The original Churchill verse, sung to him on 12 November 1954, was as follows: Sixty years on—though in time growing older, Younger at heart you return to the Hill: You, who in days of defeat ever bolder, Led us to Victory, serve Britain still. Still there are bases to guard or beleaguer, Still must the battle for Freedom be won: Long may you fight, Sir, who fearless and eager Look back to-day more than sixty years on The Starehe Boys' Centre and School rendition Adapted from the Harrow School version, written in 1872: Forty years on, when afar and asunder, Parted are those who are singing today, When we look back and forgetfully wonder What we were like in our work and our play: Brotherhood strong and our teachers devoted, Assembly, Chapel, the House where we grew, Posho, Githeri, the Founders' Day dinner, Talks in Baraza, the friendship we knew. Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Give honour again and again, To Starehe where we became men, Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu!

The \\"tramp of the twenty-two men\\" line is altered and instead is \\"the tramp of the thirty true men\\" in reference to rugby union, the national sport. It is also sung at Napier Boys' High School in Napier, at the breakup ceremony at Waitaki Boys' High in the 1960s, and at Timaru Boys' High School at least from 1913. A variation of the song was also sung at Christchurch Boys High School at least during the later 1940s and early 1950s. Feilding Agricultural High School, F.A.H.S, in Feilding, also used it as its school song for a number of years. In Australia the song is sung at a number of schools. In the Australian state of Victoria the song is sung regularly at prestigious independent schools Wesley College, Melbourne, Haileybury, Melbourne, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Camberwell Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne, being the official Old Boy anthem and at Melbourne High School's Speech Night (Graduation Night). Wynnum State high and Rockhampton Girl's Grammar School (School Song). Only the first and last verses (excluding the Winston Churchill verse) are sung. Rather than the \\"tramp of the twenty- two men\\", Haileybury College, Carey, Camberwell Grammar School, Scotch College and Melbourne High School all replace the line with the \\"tramp of the thirty- six men\\" in reference to Australian rules football being the dominant football code in Victoria. It is also the school song of Frensham School in NSW, an all-girls boarding school, where it is traditionally sung on the school's birthday and at Old Girl's reunions. In the United Kingdom: the school song of the old Brewood Grammar School for boys, Netherthorpe School, Colyton Grammar School, Dover Grammar School, Woodford County High School in Essex, Beverley Grammar School in East Yorkshire, Bolton School, Manchester Grammar School, Stand Grammar School Whitefield, High Storrs Grammar School, Sheffield, Ecclesfield Grammar School, Sheffield (1931– 1973) the now-defunct Salford Grammar School, the former Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, Leicester (succeeded by Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College) and Harrow School's affiliated school, The John Lyon School. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was also the school song of Clifton High School in Bristol, an all-girls school at the time! It is also the school song of Wycombe High School for girls and was also sung at the end of term in the 1980s at Wycombe Abbey School, in whose songbook it figured. It was also sung by King Edward's Grammar School for Boys, Five Ways, Birmingham, in the 1950s by all the school leavers. It was also the school song of Lawnswood (formerly Leeds Modern School) hence the title of Alan Bennett's play since he is a former pupil. In the King's School, Canterbury, the song was sung in the 1920s. It was replaced with 'The School of Theodore' hymn In the United States: sung at the Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (excluding the Winston Churchill verse) at the commencement ceremony. Also sung at St. Timothy's School in Stevenson, Maryland as part of a tradition dating back to 1882 (though it is sung faster and with some major alterations in the lyrics). In India: the Cathedral and John Connon School of Bombay's school song, Prima in Indus, is an adaptation of this. In Sri Lanka it is used as the school anthem of Kandy Girls' High School which is a prestigious school in Sri Lanka. In Kenya it is sung on Founders' Day at Starehe Boys' Centre and School. In South Africa: at Pretoria Boys High School, Pretoria, it is sung at all School Valedictions and assemblies at which Old Boys are present, with certain minor adaptions. 22 good men is substituted by 30 good men. It is also sung at Westville Boys High School, Durban, when the matrics have their speech night and ring the Swain bell symbolizing their departure from the school and continues ties to its family. The ringing I the bell is the final act of the Matric group before the final exams. In Thailand, at Vajiravudh College considered to be the country's best boarding school built by King Rama VI (King Vajiravudh) in 1910, the \\"tramp of twenty two men\\" became \\"The Might of Thirty Best Men\\" in reference to the school's supremacy in Rugby. There is also lyric in Thai which is sung each year before the King of Thailand at the Graduation Ceremony. In Hong Kong, the melody is used by Queen's College as its school song, with its lyrics written by Headmaster Mr. William Kay (1920). The school song of Heep Yunn School is also adapted from this song. But its lyrics are in Chinese, rather than English which Queen's College uses. In Canada, the girls at Havergal College in Toronto also sing this. A shortened and slightly altered version of this song is used near the beginning of the 2010 film adaptation of Never Let Me Go.

MTV NEWS Early years Ward was born in 1941 in Western Oklahoma and moved to Colorado when he was eleven. In 1967, in New York he joined the New York Motorbike Club, a gay S&M; group, and experimented with nipple piercing. During this time he also studied jewelry making. Ward then moved to Colorado, where he joined the gay Rocky Mountaineer Motorcycle Club and further experimented with piercing, genital in particular. In 1973, Ward moved to West Hollywood (a gay village of Los Angeles) where he met Doug Malloy. Together they developed the basic techniques and equipment that have become piercing industry standard. Innovations Ward pioneered many jewelry designs including the fixed bead ring and internally threaded barbells. He was introduced to barbell style jewelry by Horst Streckenbach (\\"Tattoo Samy\\"), a tattooist and piercer from Frankfurt, Germany, and his student Manfred \\"Tattoo\\" Kohrs from Hanover, Germany. Ward stated, \\"The first barbells I recall came from Germany. Doug had made contact with Tattoo Samy, a tattooist and piercer from Frankfurt. Over the years Samy came to the States a number of times and frequently showed up in LA to visit Doug. On one of his first visits he showed us the barbell studs that he used in some piercings. They were internally threaded, a feature that made so much sense that I immediately set out to recreate them for my own customers.\\" With funding from Malloy (derived from his work with the Muzak corporation), Ward began using his home as a private piercing studio in 1975. Dubbing his studio the Gauntlet, he drew an initial clientele from a mailing list provided by Doug and by running classified ads in local gay and fetish publications. After three years of continued refinement with techniques and equipment, Ward opened the Gauntlet as a commercial storefront operation in West Hollywood on 17 November 1978. The establishment of this business — considered the first of its type in the United States — was the beginning of the body piercing industry.\\"Running the Gauntlet\\" , cited in \\"In the Flesh: Body Piercing as a Form of Commodity-Based Identity and Ritual Rite of Passage,\\" honors thesis by Amelia Guimarin, under the direction of Prof. Teresa Caldiera, Anthropology, UC Irvine, 2005 In 1977, with the assistance of Malloy and Fakir Musafar, Ward started the piercing magazine Piercing Fans International Quarterly (PFIQ).

Established in 1928, this was the last of the Five Families to be organized. He was the family's boss for over three decades. Biography =Early life= Giuseppe Profaci was born in Villabate, in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, on October 2, 1897. In 1920, Profaci spent one year in prison in Palermo on theft charges. =Family ties= Profaci's sons were Frank Profaci and John Profaci Sr. Frank eventually joined the Profaci crime family while John Sr. followed legitimate pursuits. Two of Profaci's daughters married the sons of Detroit Partnership mobsters William Tocco and Joseph Zerilli. Profaci's brother was Salvatore Profaci, who served as his consigliere for years, and is known to have been heavily into dealing of pornographic materials. One of Profaci's brothers-in-law was Joseph Magliocco, who would eventually become Profaci's underboss. Profaci's niece Rosalie Profaci was married to Salvatore Bonanno, the son of Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Bonanno. Profaci was the uncle of Salvatore Profaci Jr., also a member of the Profaci crime family. Rosalie Profaci offered the following description of her uncle: > He was a flamboyant man who smoked big cigars, drove big black Cadillacs, > and did things like buy tickets to a Broadway play for us cousins. But he > didn't buy two or three or even four seats, he bought a whole row. Released from prison in 1921, Profaci emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City on September 4. Profaci settled in Chicago, where he opened a grocery store and bakery. However, the business was unsuccessful, and in 1925, Profaci relocated to New York, where he entered the olive oil import business. On September 27, 1927, Profaci became a United States citizen. At some point after his move to Brooklyn, Profaci became involved with local gangs. =Rise to family boss= On December 5, 1928, Profaci attended a mob meeting in Cleveland, Ohio that would make him an organized crime boss in Brooklyn. In October 1928, Brooklyn boss Salvatore D'Aquila was murdered. An important part of the Cleveland meeting, attended by mobsters from Tampa, Florida, Chicago, and Brooklyn, was to appoint Profaci as Aquila's replacement so as to maintain calm among the Brooklyn gangs. Magliocco was named as Profaci's second-in- command. Given Profaci's lack of experience in organized crime, it is unclear why the New York gangs gave him power in Brooklyn. Some speculated that Profaci received this position due to his family's status in Sicily, where they may have belonged to the Villabate Mafia. Profaci may have also benefited from contacts made through his olive oil business. Cleveland police eventually raided the meeting and expelled the mobsters from Cleveland, but Profaci's business was accomplished. By 1930, Profaci was controlling numbers, prostitution, loansharking, and narcotics trafficking in Brooklyn. In 1930, the Castellammarese War broke out in New York City. Some sources say that Profaci remained neutral, while others say that Profaci was firmly aligned with Castellammarese boss Salvatore Maranzano. When the war finally ended in 1931, top mobster Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano reorganized the New York gangs into five organized crime families. At this point, Profaci was recognized as boss of what was now the Profaci crime family, with Magliocco as underboss and Salvatore Profaci as consigliere. When Luciano created the National Crime Syndicate, also known as the Mafia Commission, he gave Profaci a seat on the governing board. Profaci's closest ally on the board was Bonanno, who would cooperate with Profaci over the next 30 years. Profaci was also allied with Stefano Magaddino, the boss of the Buffalo crime family. =Business and faith= Profaci obtained most of his wealth through traditional illegal enterprises such as protection rackets and extortion. However, to protect himself from federal tax evasion charges, Profaci still maintained his original olive oil business, known as Mamma Mia Importing Company, leading to his nickname as \\"Olive Oil King\\". As the demand for olive oil skyrocketed after World War II, his business thrived. Profaci owned 20 other businesses that employed hundreds of workers in New York. Profaci owned a large house in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a home in Miami Beach, Florida, and an estate near Hightstown, New Jersey, which previously belonged to President Theodore Roosevelt. Profaci's estate had its own airstrip and a chapel with an altar that replicated one in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Profaci was a devout Catholic who made generous cash donations to Catholic charities. A member of the Knights of Columbus, Profaci would invite priests to his estate to celebrate Mass. In May 1952, a thief stole valuable jeweled crowns from the Regina Pacis Votive shrine in Brooklyn. Profaci sent his men to recover the crowns and reportedly kill the thief. However, accounts of the thief being strangled with a rosary are unfounded. In 1949, the Vatican received a petition from a group of New York Catholics to confer a knighthood on Profaci. However, when the Brooklyn District Attorney complained about the move, the Vatican denied the petition. =Legal problems= In 1953, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service sued Profaci for over $1.5 million in unpaid income taxes. The taxes were still unpaid when Profaci died nine years later. In 1954, the US Department of Justice moved to revoke Profaci's citizenship. The government claimed that when Profaci entered the United States in 1921, he lied to immigration officials about having no arrest record in Italy. In 1960, a U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Profaci's deportation order, ending the legal action. In 1956, law enforcement recorded a phone conversation between Profaci and Antonio Cottone, a Sicilian mafioso, about exporting Sicilian oranges to the United States. In 1959, US Customs agents intercepted one of those orange crates in New York. The crate contained 90 wax oranges containing a total of pure heroin. Smugglers in Sicily had filled the hollow oranges with heroin until they weighed as much as real oranges, then packed them in the crate.Covert Money, Power & Policy: Assassination Profaci was never prosecuted for this crime. In 1957, Profaci attended the Apalachin Conference, a national mob meeting, at the farm of mobster Joseph Barbara in Apalachin, New York. While the conference was in progress, New York State Troopers surrounded the farm and raided it. Profaci was one of over 60 mobsters arrested that day. On January 13, 1960, Profaci and 21 others were convicted of conspiracy and he was sentenced to five years in prison. However, on November 28, 1960, a United States Court of Appeals overturned the verdicts. =First Colombo war= In contrast to Profaci's generosity to his relatives and the church, many of his soldati considered him miserly and mean with money. One reason for their rancor was that Profaci required each family member to pay him a $25 a month tithe, an old Sicilian gang custom. The money, which amounted to approximately $50,000 a month, was meant to support the families of mobsters in prison. However, most of this money stayed with Profaci. In addition, Profaci did not tolerate any dissent from his policies. People who expressed discontent were murdered. On February 27, 1961, the Gallos, led by Joe Gallo kidnapped four of Profaci's top men: underboss Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci's brother), capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone.Cage, Nicholas (July 17, 1972) \\"Part II The Mafia at War\\" New York pp.27-36 Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida. While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California. The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme for the hostages' release. Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand $100,000 before negotiations, but his brother Larry overruled him. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci made a deal with the Gallos. Profaci's consigliere Charles \\"the Sidge\\" LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the hostages were released peacefully.Capeci (2001), p.303 However, Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement. On August 20, 1961 Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph \\"Joe Jelly\\" Gioielli and Larry Gallo. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioilli after inviting him to go fishing. Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore \\"Sally\\" D'Ambrosio after a police officer intervened.Raab (2006), pp.321-324 The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and his loyalists; The Gallos then began calling Persico \\"The Snake\\" after he had betrayed them. the war continued on resulting in nine murders and three disappearances. With the start of the gang war, the Gallo crew retreated to the Dormitory. =Mob standoff= By 1962, Profaci's health was failing. In early 1962, Carlo Gambino and Lucchese crime family boss Tommy Lucchese tried to convince Profaci to resign to end the gang war. However, Profaci strongly suspected that the two bosses were secretly supporting the Gallo brothers and wanted to take control of his family. Profaci vehemently refused to resign; furthermore, he warned that any attempt to remove him would spark a wider gang war. Gambino and Lucchese did not pursue their efforts. =Death= On June 6, 1962, Profaci died in South Side Hospital in Bay Shore, New York of liver cancer. He is buried at Saint John Cemetery in the Middle Village section of Queens, in one of the largest mausoleums in the cemetery. After Profaci's death, Magliocco succeeded him as head of the family. In late 1963, the Mafia Commission forced Magliocco out of office and installed Joseph Colombo as family boss. At this point, the Profaci crime family became the Colombo crime family.

Career Tresham was knighted by 1524. He was chosen Sheriff in 1524, 1539, 1548 and 1555/6, and returned as a Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire in 1541 and twice in 1554. In 1530 he served on a Royal Commission inquiring into Cardinal Wolsey's possessions. In 1537 he served on another to inquire into the Lincolnshire rebellion. In 1539 he was one of those appointed to receive Henry VIII's future fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, at Calais.

It is particularly associated with the artwork of the Maranao and Sama (Badjao) people, although it can also be found to a lesser extent among neighboring Maguindanao, Iranun, Tausug, Yakan, and Lumad groups. The design elements vary among these ethnic groups, with the greatest refinement being found among the Maranao. History A Maranao kubing jaw harp handle made from horn and brass with an S-shaped naga design and a fish The origins of okir are pre-Islamic. They are believed to have originated from the much earlier okil or okil-okil decorative carving traditions of the Sama (Badjao) people, which are often highly individualistic and rectilinear. The Sama are master carvers, and they made lavish decorations on ritual animistic objects, grave markers (both in wood and stone), and their houseboats. These precursor forms of the okir designs can still be found in the art traditions of the Maranao in the basak (lowland) regions of Lake Lanao, and they contrast markedly from the later flowing okir designs. A Maranao kulintang ensemble Sama-Bajau vinta The rectilinear designs of the Sama were adopted and refined by the Maranao to decorate the torogan houses of the ruling dato class. The most prominent parts of the torogan are the panolong, the carved floor beams modeled after awang boat prows. These protrude in the front of the house and styled with elaborate okir designs, usually that of a naga (a sea serpent or dragon). These were meant to drive away evil spirits. Okir were also featured in the central housebeam, the tinai a walai (\\"intestine of the house\\"), which had ritual significance. Unlike the decorative carving traditions of the Sama, the panolong of the torogan became a symbol of power and status. As such, they increasingly became more and more elaborate, developing the flowing characteristics that it possesses today. It influenced other Maranao artforms greatly due to its association with rank and prestige, becoming used in textiles, musical instruments, betel quid containers, sculptures, weaponry, silver inlays, and so on. These designs became the standard for what came to be known as okir. From the Maranao, this spread to nearby regions through the migrations of the Iranun people (the descendants of the merchant and outcast clans of Maranao). Elements of okir have been adopted by the neighboring Maguindanao, Lumad, Yakan, and Tausug peoples of the Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago; even influencing the carving traditions of the Sama later on. However, it had limited penetration among the Visayan- descended heavily-Islamized Tausug, the dominant ethnic group of Sulu. They viewed such carvings as \\"pagan\\". Okir among the Tausug is usually limited to the hilts and scabbards of weapons. Elements and motifs =Sama= A Sama lepa with okil carvings The older Sama carving traditions (okil or okil-okil, sometimes spelled ukkil among Malaysian Sama) differ markedly from the okir of the Maranao, although elements of the okir were incorporated into later Sama carvings. Sama okil aren't bound to rules like the okir, and thus tend to be highly variable. Each artist carves according to his own tastes. Despite this, there are still shared motifs that bind them all together as Sama. Sama lepa houseboat with okil designs on the stern Sama sunduk grave markers Sama okil can be divided into two types. The most ancient okil which still survive among the animist Sama, usually the sea-going Sama Dilaut branches, feature representational artforms like human figures. These are absent in the okil versions of the Sama that converted to Islam. Sama okil also feature designs which are realistic copies of natural forms, rather than stylized designs like in okir. Marine themes are particularly common, including depictions of dugongs (duyong), usually with a person riding on its back. The three most common okil motifs used by the Muslim Sama are dauan-dauan (leaf motifs), kaloon (curlicues and curved lines), and agta-agta or buaya (fish or crocodile motifs). Nevertheless, Sama okil share some common motifs with okir. The Maranao naga (sea serpent) figure is believed to be related to the Sama agta- agta motifs. They are a particularly common motif in the beautifully-carved prows, sterns, and gunwales of various Sama-Bajau boats. Okil are also highly important among Sama grave markers (sunduk) which are found in the ancient traditional burial grounds of the Sama people in some (usually uninhabited) islands of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. These include some of the oldest examples of okil, which are usually carved from coral and limestone. Wooden carved grave markers are common later on, usually made from or carved from the boat belonging to the deceased. These are usually carved into human figures that represent the deceased. With graves of women identifiable by the presence of combs and mirrors, and graves of men by the depiction of head coverings. Graves of children usually have smaller figures. A common relatively recent tradition is the carving of elaborate stylized bed frames as grave markers. These graves are often decorated with buntings and food offerings, again reflecting the ancient ancestor worship (anito) traditions of the Sama. =Maranao= A Maranao spinning wheel (note the panolong-shaped projection) A sarimanok A Maranao malong with a langkit (decorative strip) featuring female okir designs Maranao okir motifs are so stylized that it is often easy to tell whether a carving is Maranao or not. Other ethnic groups usually introduce other elements or motifs that are non-traditional to the original Maranao okir designs. In the past, okir designs, particularly for textiles, are distinctive enough that a Maranao can usually distinguish which region someone is from based only on the patterns of their malong and their woven decorative strips (langkit). Maranao okir can be divided into two traditions, the predominantly curvilinear \\"male\\" okir-a-dato, and the predominantly rectilinear \\"female\\" okir-a-bai. Unlike Sama okil, okir designs are deliberately stylized when depicting living things, due to Islamic beliefs against idolatry. Traditional creatures featured in okir are the naga (sea serpent) and the sarimanok (feminine papanok, a rooster-like bird with a fish in its beak and another fish in its claws). The naga is common in the panolong designs, while sarimanok are usually placed on top of poles during celebrations. Other creature motifs traditionally depicted in okir include crocodiles, parrots, grasshopper heads, and swallowtails. After contact with other cultures, okir has also depicted non-native animals, including lions, peacocks, and elephants.

Lawn is spread around a small harbour in a relatively lush valley. According to one local tradition it was this lushness that inspired Captain James Cook to name the place Lawn Harbour. But it has also been speculated that a Frenchman named the community after a doe caribou that he spotted there. Lawn is a community whose survival over the past two hundred years has depended entirely on the fishery. The abundance of fish in the waters surrounding Lawn (formerly known as Laun) attracted seasonal fishermen from France, Portugal, Spain and England. These fishermen came over in large fishing ships and returned to their homelands in the fall. This type of migratory fishery continued to exist on the Burin Peninsula well into the eighteen hundreds. However, in 1763 an important event occurred which had a tremendous impact on the development of permanent settlements on the Burin Peninsula. The town of Lawn was formed as Community Council in 1952 and was changed to a Town Council in 1968. Early history Prior to 1763 the English and French were continually at war with each other. These wars took a toll on both nations, as they fought for control of various colonial possessions. Newfoundland, with its abundant supply of fish, became a colonial prize, which both nations fought over. The two nations agreed to divide the island into two zones in which they were permitted to prosecute a summer fishery. The Burin Peninsula was part of the \\"French Shore\\" in which the French had exclusive fishing rights. In the 1760s the British gained the upper hand in their war with France and finally in 1763 the French were defeated. In 1763 the French signed the Treaty of Utrecht, which forced them to abandon all territorial claims on the island of Newfoundland. The only possessions they were permitted to keep were the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. The banishment of the French made permanent settlement much more attractive in Burin Peninsula communities such as Lawn. The first settlers to establish permanent residence in Lawn were the Connors (O’Connor) family who came from County Cork, Ireland. Michael and his brother Peter Connors were fish merchants who decided to stay in Lawn after the summer fishery. Many of these workers began to spend their winters in Lawn and eventually married women from nearby communities. The Connors, Murphy, Strang, Pike and Tarrant descendants planted family roots, which have survived to this very day. The survival of Lawn in the late seventeen hundreds and early eighteen hundreds were influenced by two important factors. The most important factor was the supply of cod. The second factor was the availability of a market for the cod. In the late 18th century the Sir Robert Newman Company, one of the most powerful fishing establishments in Newfoundland, set up a business in St. Lawrence. This gave some sense of stability to the area and provided easy access to a market for fishermen from Lawn. The Sir Robert Newman Company also helped bring young men over from England and Ireland to work in the fishery. This along with the prosperous fishery made Lawn a very viable fishing settlement. One of Newfoundland's first hydroelectric generators was commissioned in Lawn in 1930. 1942 naval disaster In the pre-dawn hours of February 18, 1942, three United States Navy ships ran aground on the shore of the Burin Peninsula between Lawn and the nearby community of St. Lawrence. It was determined that the USS Pollux, USS Truxtun and USS Wilkes made a navigation error while en route to Naval Station Argentia. Under exceptionally difficult storm and ice conditions eight residents of Lawn assisted in the rescue of survivors. 185 sailors survived and 203 died as a result of the disaster.Dead Reckoning: The Pollux-Truxton Disaster See also * List of cities and towns in Newfoundland and Labrador References Populated coastal places in Canada Towns in Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Lawn, Newfoundland and Labrador"},{"id":"1215827","text":"Pale Sun, Crescent Moon is the fifth studio album by Cowboy Junkies, released in 1993. It was the band's last album of new material for RCA Records, although a live album and a greatest hits compilation were subsequently released on the label. Canadian guitarist Ken Myhr appears on every track on this album.  Album development  The Cowboy Junkies created the album within months of getting off the road from the Black Eyed Man tour. While touring, Michael Timmins started work on several new songs, and after getting home he cleaned up and finished up the tracks. Ken Myhr, who had been on the last tour with the band, was invited to join the band in working out arrangements for the songs. In April over the Easter weekend the four band members and Ken went to Studio 306 in Toronto, operated by Bob Cobban, to record the basic tracks in three very long sessions. The band had worked with Cobban at Studio 306 before when recording \\"Lost My Driving Wheel\\". After the initial sessions, the band started work on the overdub sessions, which were spread out over the next few weeks. In this cycle, Michael Timmins and Myhr added more guitar, Margo added some harmonies, Jeff Bird added embellishments, and Richard Bell added keyboard. Richard Bell had been in the industry for a while, working with The Band, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and can be heard on Janis Joplin's album Pearl, and he added a classic style of rock with his piano and organ work during the recording sessions. The album from conception to final mixing is the one of the quickest the band created. One goal with the album was just to raise the volume a bit from the Junkies earlier albums. With every album, they try to add a different element, and for this album, they opened the album with a power chord. Pale Sun, Crescent Moon is about male-female relationships. The track show different faces of relationships, showcasing mystical with \\"Crescent Moon\\", reality with \\"First Recollection\\" and \\"Ring on the Sill\\", romantic with \\"Anniversary Song\\" and \\"White Sail\\", investigates dark corners with \\"Seven Years\\", \\"Pale Sun\\", and \\"The Post\\", moves on to metaphysical with \\"Cold Tea Blues\\", delves into the unexplainable with \\"Hard to Explain\\" and \\"Hunted\\", and finally ends with a song showcasing the distrust between one man and one woman in \\"Floorboard Blues\\".

Life She was born Ana Teresa Parra Sanojo in Paris, the daughter of Rafael Parra Hernáiz, Venezuelan Ambassador in Berlin, and Isabel Sanojo de Parra. As a member of a wealthy family, Ana Teresa spent part of her childhood at her father's hacienda Tazón. After the death of her father, Ana Teresa and her sisters were taken by their mother to study at the Sacred Heart School, in Godella, Spain. Under fervent religious precepts, they received a solid education, suitable for upper-class young ladies. Ana Teresa returned to Caracas at the age of 19. After she settled in Paris, de la Parra travelled and had an intense social life. She began to research a biography of Simón Bolívar, perhaps inspired by the centenary of his death. However, her idea was interrupted when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Teresa de la Parra wandered in several European sanatoriums, mainly in Switzerland and Spain, but did not find a cure. It was then that she met Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera who would play an important role in de la Parra's life during her last years. She reflected about her philosophical and literary ideas, and studied her own work and life evolution through the years. The longest and most beautiful letters ever written to her family and friends, and her intimate diaries, come from this time and must be considered as part of her literature. Teresa de la Parra died in Madrid. Her remains were exhumed and brought to Caracas in 1947. In 1989, the 100th anniversary of her birth, she was reburied with honors at the National Pantheon in Caracas. Works She rebelled against the limited expectations for women of her class by long hours of reading and writing. Her fantastic stories were published in the newspaper El Universal, and her Diary of a Caraqueña in the Far East was published in the magazine Actualidades. De la Parra's story Mama X earned first prize in a contest held in a provincial Venezuelan city. This story, as well as her Diary of a young lady who writes because she is bored (which was published in the magazine La Lectura Semanal) was the beginning of her first major work. =Iphigenia= De la Parra's novel Iphigenia: Diary of a young lady who wrote because she was bored, published in 1924, marked a change in Venezuelan literature. Teresa de la Parra wrote most of the novel in 1921 and 1922 during the dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez. Some of the characters in the novel were maliciously close to caricatures of people who were then well known in Caracas society. The characters Abuelita, Tía Clara and César Leal represent strict adherence to morality. Ambitious and politically corrupt characters like Gabriel Olmedo and Tío Pancho also reflect moral freedom given to men, in contrast against the passive role assigned to women. The protagonist of Iphigenia, María Eugenia Alonso, a well-educated and intelligent young woman, is partly a self-portrait of the author. María Eugenia struggles against being confined in a marriage that threatens to stifle her intellectual development. She strives to determine whether it is possible for an intelligent and educated woman to evade marriage without losing her respectability in a society where women are expected to become wives and mothers. The tone, thematic nature and social-historic context of Iphigenia made it controversial among some social and literary circles in Venezuela and Colombia. Juan Vicente Gómez's government would not give Venezuelan publishers money to publish Iphigenia. Teresa de la Parra travelled to Paris, where she had friends such as Simón Barceló, Alberto Zérega Fombona, Ventura García Calderón and Gonzalo Zaldumbide. Winner of the annual award given by Casa Editora Franco-Ibero- Americana in Paris in 1924, Teresa de la Parra finally had her work published and received a prize of 10,000 French francs. Iphigenia became a categorical success among Parisian intellectuals and readers. It was soon translated into French. Two years after multiple trips and works — which included lectures in Nations Society and exquisite answers to critics — the writer began her second major work. =Mama Blanca's Memoirs= Memorias de Mamá Blanca (\\"Mama Blanca's Memoirs\\"), published in 1929, was a nostalgia-filled fictionalized memoir of De la Parra's childhood. The spirit of the four sisters living on the hacienda Tazón is reflected in the six sisters living on the hacienda Piedra Azul. The moral \\"correctness\\" of Souvenirs of Mama Blanca received favorable attention from those who had criticized Iphigenia. In her letters, de la Parra wrote that there was no Iphigenia scent in Souvenirs of Mama Blanca, which had no protest speech, revolutionary ideas or social criticism. De la Parra became a sought-after lecturer. Her more important speeches took place in Havana and Bogotá; this last one was very meaningful about her personal ideas of women's roles in Latin American society from colonial times to the 20th century.

Etymology The word \\"replevin\\" is of Anglo-Norman origin and is the noun form of the verb \\"replevy\\". This comes from the Old French replevir, derived from plevir (\\"to pledge\\"), which is derived from the Latin replegiare (\\"to redeem a thing taken by another\\"). Nature In The Law of Torts, John Fleming has written: In common law, several types of action existed with respect to deprivation of possession (being subdivided into the wrongful taking of chattels and the unjust detention of them, even where the original taking was lawful): * In the case of wrongful taking: ** A writ of replevin was available only for an unlawful taking in the nature of a wrongful distress, where restitution could be made for the goods wrongfully taken (being in the nature of a redelivery of the pledge or the thing taken in distress) with damages for the loss sustained by such action. As distrained goods are in the custody of the law, any attempt to take them back by force without a writ of replevin could be contested by writ of rescous or de parco fracto, with a remedy in damages. ** A writ of trespass vi et armis was available in the taking of goods, with a remedy in damages. ** An action of trover and conversion was available for the non- forcible taking of goods, with a remedy in damages. * In the case of unjust detention: ** Replevin lay to recover goods still held after a tender of amends. ** Detinue lay to recover lent goods where the holder refused to return them to the owner. However, the defendant was allowed to exculpate himself by oath, so this action was displaced by that of trover and conversion. At common law, the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken was originally one of detinue, but no means of immediate recovery was possible until the action was tried. Replevin arose to deal with the matter of the illegal distress of goods for rent or damage feasant, in order to procure their restoration to the owner. Illegal distress has been held to occur where: #no relationship of landlord and tenant exists at all, #there is no demise at a fixed rent, #no rent is due, or none due to the person who has distrained, #goods have been released before the distress, or tendered before the impounding, #the entry was illegal, or #things privileged from distress (ie, neither goods nor chattel) have been seized. Replevin will not lie where if any part of the rent claimed was due, but this defence is not effective where the only rent claimed by the landlord is not recoverable by distress. It has been held that replevin applies to any wrongful taking of goods and chattel. A party seeking relief may elect to adjudicate the right to possession prior to obtaining immediate relief to obtain the property in question. In such cases, replevin actions are still designed to afford the petitioning party a relatively speedy process for obtaining judgment, as compared to typical lawsuits. The summary remedy afforded by replevin statutes can be thwarted by defendants who contest the claimant's right to possession, by contesting the plaintiff's complaint, and insisting on traditional litigation involving discovery, and in some cases, trial by jury. Replevin actions are often filed by secured creditors seeking to take possession of collateral securing loans or other debt instruments, such as retail installment contracts. A common example is where an automobile finance company initiates a replevin action to gain possession of a vehicle, following payment default. Replevin actions are usually employed when the lender cannot find the collateral, or cannot peacefully obtain it through self-help repossession. Replevin actions may also be pursued by true owners of property, e.g., consignors seeking return of consigned property that the party in possession will not relinquish for one reason or another. Replevin is an action of civil law, not criminal law. Therefore, because of the differing burden of proof, a defendant found not guilty of criminal theft may nevertheless be required to return the disputed item or items in civil court. Replevin does not provide compensation for any monetary loss arising from the loss of use of some income-producing property item. Replevin involves return of an actual specific item or items, not monetary compensation for loss. Thus, it would not normally be used in a case regarding a sum of money, as distinct from the loss of a rare coin, for instance, where the return of the actual coin itself was at issue. In occasional cases of no particular numismatic interest, however, e.g., a bag of money whose contents have not yet been counted, an action may be filed to recover the actual coins and/or bills in question if they are still together. The question of replevin becomes moot should the item in question no longer exist as an entity, i.e. if it is destroyed, or in the case of a bag of money, for instance, if the money has been spent. For this reason, the item is normally seized by the court when the action is filed and held until the decision is reached to prevent the waste of a legal action over a nonexistent object and, further, to ensure that the item in question is not destroyed, spent, etc., during the action. This can be used to force a settlement from the defendant, just or unjust, as he or she is deprived of the use of the disputed object for the duration of the action; if this results in a financial loss, the defendant may find it advantageous to merely pay a relatively small settlement and have the item returned quickly. Replevin remains the modern action, albeit defined by statute, for recovery of chattels pending a decision of the right of possession. It lies only where the possession was taken from the plaintiff, whether under colour of legal process or otherwise, by an act having the nature of a trespass. History One of the oldest actions in the royal courts, replevin had its roots in the law of customary courts, and its formal origin can be attributed to Glanvil, Chief Justiciar of England during the reign of Henry II (1154–1189). Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (distractio). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as damage feasant. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock damage feasant, the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving \\"gage and pledge\\" – a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay in the fact that the distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred. The action in replevin began to appear in the thirteenth century. It seems clear that originally the action of replevin lay simply where the question to be determined was that of wrongful distress. Excess and abuse of distress was punished.Year Book 32 Edward IYear Book 33 Edward I p. 5452 Henry III (1267), cc. 1,2,3,4 Since the distrainor did not get possession he was not originally liable in trespass, and the spheres of the two forms of action remained distinct. During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained.Year Book 7 Henry IV, M., pl. 5 at f. 29 It was also held that replevin could be used in place of the writ of trespass de bonis aspotatis (trespass by the asportation of goods). In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all., at fn. 2 The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner. In 1856, Mennie v. Blake summarized the law of replevin by stating, \\"... it seems clear that replevin is not maintainable unless in a case in which there has been first a taking out of the possession of the owner. This stands upon authority and the reason of the thing\\". The mere claim by the distrainor that he had a right to the chattels distrained was a technicality that ended the action in replevin. It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ de proprietate probanda – a writ \\"concerning the proof of ownership\\".H. E. L., III p. 284, n.7; S. S., p. 197 During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the action of trover also arose, which largely replaced that of trespass in the matter of wrongful distress. Replevin and trover never completely coincided, because there was a limitation on replevin. Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 came into effect in England and Wales, a defendant was able to exercise an option of paying damages instead of restoring the actual goods.Common Law Procedure Act 1854, s. 78, discussed at Section 65 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 made provision for the common law rules governing replevin in England and Wales to be replaced, although this provision did not become effective until 6 April 2014. Use Replevin actions are common and fall into two types of action: if immediate possession of the property is sought and if the party filing the action is content to wait for an adjudication of final rights. In a case in which immediate possession of property is sought, the petitioning creditor is often required to post a bond to protect the defendant against wrongful detention. That approach can be a very powerful weapon in a case of someone holding property wrongly because it deprives the holder of the use of the property while the case is awaiting trial, thereby putting pressure on the holder to settle the matter quickly. This replevin process falls into two stages: #the replevy, the steps that the owner takes to secure the physical possession of the goods, by giving security for prosecuting the action and for the return of the goods if the case goes against him and #the action (suit) of replevin itself (at common law, the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken would be one of detinue; but no means of immediate recovery liable to be seized). Replevin is used when the party having the right of property cannot simply invoke self-help and take the property back. If the party has the ability to do so directly, the action is referred to as repossession. For example, in the states of Wisconsin and Louisiana, if a person who finances an automobile, becomes a registered owner of that vehicle and fails to make payments as agreed, the lienholder cannot simply repossess the vehicle. The lienholder must go to court and obtain an order of replevin. In many cases, parties initiating a replevin action will elect not to gain immediate possession of the collateral or other wrongfully-held property and will instead file the replevin action without posting a bond. Once service of process is achieved, the defendant will likely be required to attend a court hearing on a specific date, then the parties' rights to possession will be adjudicated. A plaintiff creditor can typically prevail in the case by offering testimony and business records showing the borrower/defendant's obligation to pay, and default in payment. The Court will thereafter issue a judgment and authorize issuance of a writ of replevin, which is served by a sheriff's deputy, working in conjunction with persons hired or employed by the creditor to take the collateral or other property into its possession. The sheriff's role is to keep the peace and allow the creditor to get its property, without threat from the borrower. Once the creditor takes the property into its possession, it can sell the collateral, and apply the proceeds to the debt owed by the borrower. In other cases, replevy is used to prevent damages that may occur from the continued use of an item, such as a public utility meter. In the case of non- payment of a public utility, a meter is typically left on the premise to allow reconnection should the balance due be paid, or if the person owing the bill sells the premise to another person who does not owe arrears to the utility, however, it is possible for one to reconnect the device and continue obtaining the commodity in question. In such cases, the utility could seek replevin for the utility meter itself, thereby preventing this practice. Law of replevin internationally In the 1899 case of McGregor v. McGregor,McGregor v. McGregor, 6 BCR 432 (1899) Irving J of the British Columbia Supreme Court wrote: Provisions analogous to replevin in the case of distraint are found in the Civil Code of Quebec (known as movable hypothec without delivery, at et seq.) and St Lucia (arts. 1888 et seq.), which was reproduced in substance from French law, which is also in force in Mauritius.

In 1986, the vessel was handed over to the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario for preservation as a museum ship. Previously, during the summer months the vessel was also operated as a bed and breakfast. In 2017, the ship was sold to The Lakehead Transportation Museum Society in Thunder Bay, Ontario and in June, was relocated to the Pool 6 site on the town's harbour front, where Alexander Henry continues as a museum ship. Design and description Alexander Henry is a light icebreaker and buoy tender that was designed to serve on the Great Lakes. The vessel displaces and is measured at . The ship is long overall and long between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The ship is powered by two Fairbanks-Morse 10-cylinder 2-cycle 37F16 diesel engines driving two shafts creating . This gives the ship a maximum speed of . No helicopter facilities were added to the ship as they were considered unnecessary for freshwater operations. Operational history The vessel was constructed by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. at their yard in Port Arthur, Ontario and launched on 18 July 1958. The icebreaker entered service in July 1959 with the Department of Transport's Marine Service as CGS Alexander Henry using the prefix \\"Canadian Government Ship\\". Named after Alexander Henry the elder, an 18th-century British explorer and fur trader, she was transferred in 1962 to the newly created Canadian Coast Guard and given the new prefix Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS). CCGS Alexander Henry served her entire coast guard career on the Great Lakes, stationed on Lake Superior. In 1976, the vessel was used for an experiment testing the icebreaking capability of a hover platform pushed in front of the ship. Attached to the ship's bow, the hover platform worked well in certain conditions, but required too much fuel and made excess noise. The hover platform also became an impediment to the ship should the platform breakdown. The planned deployment to cargo ships was never approved and though the experiment failed, self-propelled hovercraft are now utilised for icebreaking. Alexander Henry retired from service in 1985 after entered service. =As a museum ship= In June 1985, Alexander Henry was turned over the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario to become a museum ship. The vessel was used as floating maritime gallery and seasonal bed and breakfast by the museum. Alexander Henry entered Kingston's drydocks in 2010 to undergo inspection for conservation issues. Following the sale of the property in early 2016 that the Marine Museum was housed in, the museum was forced to find a new location for Alexander Henry. The ship was temporarily housed by a local entrepreneur until the former Coast Guard vessel's fate can be determined. The icebreaker was moved to a wharf near Prinyer's Cove in Prince Edward County, Ontario. The city of Kingston was given three options to deal with the ship; offer to sell Alexander Henry to Thunder Bay, where the vessel was constructed. This was the cheapest alternative in disposing of the ship, as converting it to an artificial reef would cost over $422,000 and to scrap the vessel, $326,000. The Lakehead Transportation Museum Society purchased the vessel for $2 and on 11 April 2017, received $125,000 provided by the City of Thunder Bay to cover towing costs to bring the ship from Kingston to Thunder Bay. Alexander Henry departed Kingston on 20 June and arrived in Thunder Bay on 28 June. The vessel was docked temporarily at the C.N. Ore Dock until Alexander Henrys permanent site was ready at the Pool 6 site along the city's waterfront. The museum ship opened to public tours on 18 July.

Bicaz used to be a border town until 1918. Six villages are administered by the town: Capșa, Dodeni, Izvoru Alb, Izvoru Muntelui, Potoci and Secu. Economy Before the construction of the dam (1950–1960) the settlement was just a mountain village in Eastern Carpathians where the main economic activity was timber harvesting. By tradition, the tree trunks were linked together, forming a raft (pluta); a raftman () used to drive the raft on the Bistriţa river downstream to wood processing facilities in Piatra Neamț. Building the dam created also a horizontal industry: two cement and aggregate plants were built in Bicaz proper and nearby Tașca. This, together with the construction of the Bicaz-Stejaru Hydro Power Plant (10 km to the east) triggered a relative economic boom during the communist period. Bicaz cement plant was shut down after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and is slowly being taken apart. On the other hand, the Tașca cement plant was acquired by the German group HeidelbergCement and completely overhauled.Romania - HeidelbergCement Group The town has also a few timber factories and wood processing facilities. Access The town has access to two national roads: DN15 20px and DN12C 20px while Bicaz railway station is the terminus station on CFR Line 509 with scheduled daily service to Bucharest North. The town served also as a port with scheduled ferry service with the villages on lake shore in the 1960s and 1970s. Today the facility offers only seasonal leisure cruises. Tourism The town is located in the proximity of two important tourist destinations in Romania: Ceahlău Massif (12 km north) and Cheile Bicazului-Hășmaș National Park (25 km to the west). The impressive Bicaz Dam built on the river Bistrița in the 1950s (one of the biggest in Romania) and the resulted Bicaz Lake are also popular tourist sights.

It is believed to be the first legal dictionary to be based on American law, and is still in publication. It has been frequently revised and republished, and was retitled Bouvier's Law Dictionary in 1897. Bouvier also published The Institutes of American Law (1851) and an edition of Matthew Bacon's Abridgment of the Law. Life John Bouvier was born in 1787 in Codognan, France, in the department du Gard, to Jean Bouvier (1760–1803) and Marie Benezet (1760–1823). They were members of the Quakers. John Bouvier was educated in Nimes. In 1802, Jean and Marie Bouvier, John Bouvier, and his brother Daniel emigrated to America and settled in Philadelphia. Bouvier's father died within a year of yellow fever, and his mother later returned to France. John Bouvier was apprenticed to age 21 to a Philadelphia Quaker, Benjamin Johnson, a printer and bookseller who had known the family while traveling in France. In 1808, John Bouvier began a printing business on Cypress Alley in west Philadelphia. In 1810, he married Elizabeth Widdifield (1789–1870), by whom he had one daughter, astronomical writer and cookbook author Hannah Mary Bouvier Peterson (1811–1870). Bouvier became a citizen of the United States in 1812. By 1814, Bouvier was living in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, where on Wednesday, November 9, 1814, he published the first issue of The American Telegraph. In the weekly newspaper, he resolved to \\"discountenance factions and factious men\\" while following an editor's duty of \\"exposure and support of the truth\\". In 1818, Bouvier moved to Uniontown, Pennsylvania where he joined with another periodical to publish The Genius of Liberty and American Telegraph. He continued to be involved in its publication until July 18, 1820. Legal career While active as a printer and publisher, Bouvier began to study law, under the tutelage of Andrew Stewart. He was admitted to the bar in Fayette County, Pennsylvania in 1818. In 1822, he was admitted to serve as an attorney in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. In 1823, he moved back to Philadelphia. Bouvier was appointed Recorder of the City of Philadelphia in 1836, by Governor Joseph Ritner, and became an associate justice of the court of criminal sessions of Philadelphia in 1838. He was best known, however, for his legal writings. Having himself experienced the difficulty of studying treatises based on British laws that no longer applied to the United States, Bouvier wrote his own American law dictionary, Law Dictionary Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America and of the Several States of the American Union (1839). He hoped that being \\"written entirely anew, and calculated to remedy those defects, [it] would be useful to the profession\\". It is believed to be the first legal dictionary to be based on American law. It was well received by bibliographer Samuel Austin Allibone and by other jurists including Chancellor James Kent of the New York Supreme Court and Justice Joseph Story of the United States Supreme Court. Bouvier himself revised and published new editions in 1843 and 1848. After his death, it continued to be updated and published, and was retitled Bouvier's Law Dictionary by Francis Rawle in 1897. Bouvier also published an edition of Matthew Bacon's Abridgment of the Law (10 vols, 1842-1846), and a compendium of American law entitled The Institutes of American Law (4 vols, 1851) that outlined legal principles such as bailment, contracts, and property. Bouvier died on November 18, 1851, a week after being \\"stricken with apoplexy\\" while working at his office. He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Geography The city lies in the Mureș River valley and it straddles the river Sebeș. It is at the crossroads of two main highways in Romania: European route E68 - DN7 coming from Sibiu and going towards Deva and European route E81 - DN1 coming from Sibiu and going towards Alba-Iulia and Cluj Napoca. A1 motorway (Romania) passes north and east of the city. It is situated at 15 km south of the county capital Alba Iulia and it also has three villages under its administration: * Petrești (Petersdorf; Péterfalva) - 3.5 km south * Lancrăm (Langendorf; Lámkerék) – 2 km north * Răhău (Reichau; Rehó) - 6 km east. History It is believed that there has been an earlier rural settlement in this area, with Romanian and Pecheneg population, situated east of today's city. The city itself was built by German settlers - later referred as Transylvanian Saxons, but actually originating from the region of Rhine and Moselle - on the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom in the second half of the 12th century and became an important city in medieval Transylvania. Its city walls were reinforced after the Tatar (Mongol) invasions from 1241–1242, but the city was occupied in 1438 by the Ottoman Empire. Transylvania's voivode John I Zápolya died in Sebeș in 1540. The Transylvanian Diet met in Sebeș in 1546, 1556, 1598 and 1600. The location of the meetings, the Zápolya House, is now a museum. After the union with Romania in 1918, the first mayor of the city was Lionel Blaga, the brother of the Romanian poet and philosopher Lucian Blaga, who was born in the nearby village of Lancrăm.

Some sources suggest that his parents were German immigrants.,Samuel Smiles, Industrial Biography (1879), p 103 but it seems that they were both born in Lincolnshire.Rootsweb Huntsman started business as a clock, lock and tool maker in Doncaster, Yorkshire. His reputation enabled him to also practice surgery in an experimental fashion and he was also consulted as an oculist. Huntsman experimented in steel manufacture, first at Doncaster. Then in 1740 he moved to Handsworth, near Sheffield. Eventually, after many experiments, Huntsman was able to make satisfactory cast steel, in clay pot crucibles, each holding about 34 pounds of blistered steel. A flux was added, and they were covered and heated by means of coke for about three hours. The molten steel was then poured into moulds and the crucibles reused. The local cutlery manufacturers refused to buy Huntsman's cast steel, as it was harder than the German steel they were accustomed to using. For a long time Huntsman exported his whole output to France. The growing competition of imported French cutlery made from Huntsman's cast-steel alarmed the Sheffield cutlers, who, after trying unsuccessfully to get the export of the steel prohibited by the British government, were compelled to use it in the interests of self-preservation. Huntsman had not patented his process, and his secret was discovered by a Sheffield iron-founder called Walker. Walker, according to legend, entered Huntsman's works in the disguise of a starving beggar asking to sleep by a fire for the night. In 1770, Huntsman moved his enterprise to Worksop Road in Attercliffe, where he prospered until his death in 1776 and was laid to rest with a commemorative tomb in the Hilltop Cemetery, Attercliffe Common. The business was taken over by his son, William Huntsman (1733–1809). At Sheffield's Northern General Hospital one of the original main buildings is named after him, and in the city centre is a Wetherspoons pub called The Benjamin Huntsman.

Biography  = Background = Camillo Carmine Galante was born on February 21, 1910, in a tenement building in the East Harlem section of Manhattan. His parents, Vincenzo \\"James\\" Galante and Vincenza Russo, had emigrated from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, to New York City in 1906, where Vincenzo was a fisherman. Carmine Galante had two brothers, Samuel and Peter Galante, and two sisters, Josephine and Angelina Galante. On February 10, 1945, Galante married Helen Marulli, by whom he had three children; James Galante, Camille Galante, and Angela Galante. For the last 20 years of his life, Carmine Galante lived with Ann Acquavella; the couple had two children together. He was the uncle to Bonanno crime family capo James Carmine Galante.Indictment Details Fraud By Mafia Crime Family by Selwyn Raab (July 8, 1992) New York Times While in prison in 1931, doctors diagnosed Galante as having a psychopathic personality. Galante owned the Rosina Costume Company in Brooklyn, New York and was associated with the Abco Vending Company of West New York, New Jersey. = Early years = At the age of 10, Galante was sent to reform school due to his criminal activities. He soon formed a juvenile street gang on New York's Lower East Side. By the age of 15, Galante had dropped out of seventh grade. As a teenager, Galante became a Mafia associate during the Prohibition era, becoming a leading enforcer by the end of the decade. During this period, Galante also worked as a fish sorter and at an artificial flower shop. On December 12, 1925, the 15-year-old Galante pleaded guilty to assault charges. On December 22, 1926, Galante was sentenced to at least two-and-a-half years in state prison. In August 1930, Galante was arrested for the murder of police officer Walter DeCastilla during a payroll robbery. However, Galante was never indicted. Also in 1930, New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Joseph Meenahan caught Galante and other gang members attempting to hijack a truck in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In the ensuing gun battle, Galante wounded Meenahan and a six-year-old bystander, both survived. On February 8, 1931, after pleading guilty to attempted robbery Galante was sentenced to 12 and a half years in state prison. On May 1, 1939, Galante was released from prison on parole. By 1940, Galante was carrying out \\"hits\\" for Vito Genovese, the official underboss of the Luciano crime family. Galante had an underworld reputation for viciousness and was suspected by the NYPD of involvement in over eighty murders.Raab, Selwyn. Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires. New York: St. Martin's Press 2005. Galante reportedly had a cold, dead-eyed stare with eyes that betrayed an utter indifference to human life, scaring both law enforcement as well as other Mafia members. Ralph Salerno, a former NYPD detective, once said, \\"Of all the gangsters that I've met personally, and I've met dozens of them in all of my years, there were only two who, when I looked them straight in the eye, I decided I wouldn't want them to be really personally mad at me. Aniello Dellacroce was one and Carmine Galante was the other. They had bad eyes, I mean, they had the eyes of killers. You could see how frightening they were, the frigid glare of a killer.\\" In 1943, Galante allegedly murdered Carlo Tresca, the publisher of an anti-fascist newspaper in New York. Genovese, living in exile in Italy, offered to kill Tresca as a favor to Italian President Benito Mussolini. Genovese allegedly gave the murder contract to Galante. On January 11, 1943, Galante allegedly shot and killed Tresca as he stepped outside his newspaper office in Manhattan, and then got in a car and drove away. Although Galante was arrested as a suspect, no one was ever charged in the murder. After the Tresca murder, Galante was sent back to prison on a parole violation. On December 21, 1944, Galante was released from prison.  Later years  In 1953, boss Joseph Bonanno sent Galante to Montreal, Quebec to supervise the family drug business there where he worked with Vincenzo Cotroni of the Cotroni crime family in the French Connection. The Bonannos were importing huge amounts of heroin by ship into Montreal and then sending it into the United States. Police also estimated that Galante was collecting gambling profits in Montreal worth about $50 million per year.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.63. In April 1956, due to Galante's strong-arm extortion tactics, the Canadian Government deported him back to the United States. In October 1957, Bonanno and Galante, now consigliere,Raab, Selwyn.

Attendees included Lucky Luciano and other American mobsters, with a Sicilian Mafia delegation led by mobster Giuseppe Genco Russo. As part of the agreement, Sicilian mobsters would come to the U.S. to distribute the narcotics. Galante brought many young men, known as Zips, from his family home of Castellammare del Golfo, Trapani, to work as bodyguards, contract killers and drug traffickers. In 1958, after being indicted on drug conspiracy charges, Galante went into hiding. On June 3, 1959, New Jersey State Police officers arrested Galante after stopping his car on the Garden State Parkway close to New York City. Federal agents had recently discovered that Galante was hiding in a house on Pelican Island off the South Jersey shore. After posting $100,000 bail, he was released. On May 18, 1960, Galante was indicted on a second set of narcotics charges; he surrendered voluntarily. Galante's first narcotics trial started on November 21, 1960 and one of his co-defendants was the infamous William Bentvena (\\"Billy Batts\\" murdered by Tommy DeSimone).United States of America, Appellee, v. William Bentvena et al., Defendants-appellants, 319 F.2d 916 (2d Cir. 1963) From the beginning, the first trial was characterized by jurors and alternates dropping out and coercive courtroom displays by the defendants.

The jury foreman had \\"fallen\\" down some stairs at an abandoned building in the middle of the night and was unable to continue the trial due to injury. Galante was sentenced to 20 days in jail due to contempt of court. On July 10, 1962, after being convicted in his second narcotics trial, Galante was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. = Power grab = In January 1974, Galante was released from prison on parole. Following his release from prison, Galante allegedly ordered the bombing of the doors to the private mausoleum of his enemy Frank Costello in St. Michael's Cemetery, who had died in 1973. On February 23, 1974, at a meeting at the Americana Hotel in Manhattan, the Commission named Philip \\"Rusty\\" Rastelli as boss. When Rastelli was sent to prison in 1976, Galante seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss.Raab, pp. 203–205 During the late 1970s, Galante allegedly organized the murders of at least eight members of the Gambino family, with whom he had an intense rivalry, in order to take over a massive drug-trafficking operation. On March 3, 1978, Galante's parole was revoked by the United States Parole Commission and he was sent back to prison. Galante had allegedly violated parole by associating with other Bonanno mobsters. However, on February 27, 1979, a judge ruled that the government had illegally revoked Galante's parole and ordered his immediate release from prison. = Death = Galante shot dead at a restaurant patio with a cigar still held between his teeth. The New York crime families were alarmed at Galante's brazen attempt to take over the narcotics market. Genovese crime family boss Frank Tieri began contacting Cosa Nostra leaders to build a consensus for Galante's murder, even obtaining approval from the retired Joseph Bonanno.Sifakis, Carl (2005). p. 443. In 1979, they received a boost when the official boss, Rastelli, sought Commission approval to kill Galante. Joseph Massino, a Bonanno soldier loyal to Rastelli, relayed the request to the Commission, who swiftly approved a contract on Galante.Raab, pp. 607–608 On July 12, 1979, Galante was killed just as he finished eating lunch on an open patio at Joe and Mary's Italian-American Restaurant at 205 Knickerbocker Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Galante was dining with Leonard Coppola, a Bonanno capo, and restaurant owner/cousin Giuseppe Turano, a Bonanno soldier. Also sitting at the table were Galante's Sicilian bodyguards, Baldassare Amato and Cesare Bonventre. At 2:45 pm, three ski-masked men entered the restaurant, walked into the patio, and opened fire with shotguns and handguns. Galante, Turano, and Coppola were killed instantly. A picture of the murdered Galante showed a cigar still in his mouth. Amato and Bonventre, who did nothing to protect Galante, were left unharmed. The gunmen then ran out of the restaurant. Richard Kuklinski alleged that he carried out dozens of murders on behalf of Gambino soldier Roy DeMeo, including that of Galante. Mob expert, Jerry Capeci dismissed Kuklinski's claims as \\"mostly demented ramblings\\". = Aftermath = The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York refused to allow a funeral mass for Galante due to his notoriety. Galante was buried at Saint John's Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens. In 1984, Bonventre was found murdered in a New Jersey warehouse, allegedly to guarantee his silence in the Galante murder.Sifakis, Carl (2005). p. 53. On January 13, 1987, Anthony Indelicato was sentenced to 40 years in prison, as a defendant in the Commission trial, for the Galante, Coppola, and Turano murders.  Popular culture  In 2005, contract killer Richard Kuklinski (who died in 2006 in Trenton State Prison, New Jersey) claimed that he was one of the hitmen who killed Galante. Although never mentioned by name, Galante is referred to twice in the movie Donnie Brasco. Galante first appears as a cigar-smoking character known as \\"The boss\\". Later in the film, Galante's murder is reported on the front page of a newspaper. Mobster Lefty Ruggiero points to the story and says, \\"Can you believe it? The fuckin' boss gets whacked!\\" The HBO show The Sopranos refers to Galante's assassination in the episode \\"A Hit Is a Hit\\". Tony Soprano is playing golf with his neighbor, Dr. Bruce Cusamano. After someone asks Cusamano if he ever saw the picture of the dead Galante with a cigar hanging from his mouth, Cusamano describes the murder as a \\"fuckin' beautiful hit\\". Galante is depicted in the first episode of the UK history TV channel Yesterday's documentary series Mafia's Greatest Hits.

He was a delegate for New Jersey in the Continental Congress in 1785 and 1786. Engineering career  Josiah was born in Staffordshire, England, the son of steam power pioneer Joseph Hornblower. As a young man, he studied mechanics and mathematics. In 1745, he started working for his elder brother Jonathan as an engineering apprentice. They went to Cornwall, England and built Newcomen steam engines for use in tin mines. Josiah became an expert in both the engines and mining operations. Around 1753, the Schuyler family brought him to America to support their copper mines on New Barbadoes Neck. Hornblower settled in Belleville and is credited with building the first steam engine in America in 1755. There is some dispute about the validity of the project, since he apparently (and illegally) brought two or three sets of critical engine parts with him from England. He continued to practice mechanical and civil engineering for much of his life. In 1794, he built the first stamping mill in America. (A stamping mill mechanically crushes raw ore for further processing.)  Before the revolution  In 1755, Josiah married Elizabeth Kingsland, the daughter of Colonel William Kingsland of Bergen County. One of their sons was Joseph Coerten Hornblower, who later became chief justice of New Jersey’s supreme court. Over the years, Hornblower became American in his attitude as well as by residence. In the French and Indian War, he was a captain in the Essex County Regiment of the New Jersey militia. However, his company was assigned for defence and he didn’t see action. In 1760, he opened a hardware store as an adjunct to his engineering work, and became a prosperous merchant. Political career  For several years, Josiah had acted as a leading citizen. He served as clerk in various town meetings and for his county. As New Jersey established a revolutionary government, Essex County sent him to the state’s Assembly from 1777–1780, and in 1780, the Assembly named him its speaker. From 1781 until 1784, he was a member of the New Jersey Legislative Council, which functioned as an upper house in the legislature. Then in 1785, the New Jersey assembly sent Hornblower as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. His term started in November 1785 and ran for a year. While he was diligent in attendance and voting, he wasn’t a leading member of the Congress. After his year, he returned home to attend to his engineering and mercantile pursuits. Later life  Josiah remained active in engineering circles, and for a time served as the head of a mine association. He expanded his operations, opening various mills in along the Second River and the Passaic River over the next two decades. He remained somewhat active in public life as well, serving as a County Judge from 1790 until 1808, when his failing health forced him to resign. Josiah died in Newark on January 21, 1809 and is buried in the yard of the Dutch Reformed Church at Belleville.

It had, , a population of 20,496. Three villages are administered by the town: Blebea, Humulești, and Humuleștii Noi.  History  Originally a market town, hence its name (in Romanian \\"târg\\" = market), it had an important role in Moldavian culture. It was first mentioned in a late-14th century document. The name neamț is a generic name of Slavic origin for the German people in the Romanian language. This has led to speculation of a German foundation of Târgu Neamț, according to which Saxon colonists crossed the Carpathians from the Bistrița area and built a commercial township. Some Romanian historians, including B. P. Hașdeu consider that Târgu Neamț was probably a German settlement from the 13th century, when the Teutonic Order made incursions from Transylvania against the Cumanic peoples that were living in Moldavia. Nowadays, historians disagree with this possibility mostly because of the long-lasting influences of the communist-nationalistic historiography which refused to accept the town was anything else than a Romanian-founded settlement.  Access  The town is located at the crossing of two national roads: 20px and 20px. The planned East-West Motorway will bypass the town on its south when completed, providing access to Iași (to the east) and Târgu Mureș to the west. The railroad station is the terminus station of CFR Line 517 linking it to Pașcani via an electrified railway.  Tourism and attractions  * The Neamț Fortress (Cetatea Neamțului) was built in the 14th century by Voivode Petru I (possibly on the ruins of a smaller Teutonic castle), and is located on the north bank of the Neamț river. * Târgu Neamț is an appropriate starting point for trips to the monasteries in the region, located all on an average 15 km radius: Neamț Monastery, Secu, Agapia, Văratec Monastery. and Sihla Skete.

It was the band's debut album, and is composed almost entirely of rock and blues covers. Only one song, \\"Take Me\\", is an original song by the band.  Album development  The Cowboy Junkies formed as a band when Michael Timmins and Alan Anton returned to Canada from England in 1985 and started assembling a new band and a new sound. They rented a house on 547 Crawford Street in Toronto and insulated the garage to form their own rehearsal space, later referred to as Studio 547. They recruited Michael's younger brother Pete Timmins for drums and started exploring new sounds, drawing improvisation from jazz musicians Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and John Coltrane while applying the sound to the early blues of Lightnin' Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, Bukka White, and Robert Johnson. They initially recruited Michael's older brother John, but he left before the group coalesced. Instead, they recruited Michael's younger sister, Margo, who was working as a social worker and not interested in pursuing music and was considering going to graduate school. The musicians developed their languid tempos and whispery tones of their early works by necessity. Their rehearsal space bordered right on their neighbors, and during their first jam session, the neighbors called the police complaining about the noise. The band toned down their sound, and Margo realized that her voice was more effective when sung quiet. The musicians felt if they could get under her quiet voice, the sound was more effective. Pete started using brushes for his drum work, learning to play drums as they went. The band learned to play with less volume. The band's first gig was in 1986 at The Rivoli, a restaurant on Toronto's Queen Street bar strip. The music was a rhythmic groove while Margo improvised melodies and sang portions of old blues songs. In the audience was Peter Moore. He states that \\"The very first show, people weren't paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly. Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the time\\". Peter Moore and the band met again later at a dinner party held by Blue Rodeo's Greg Keelor, and when they got talking about recording equipment and techniques, Moore found that his interest in single-mic recording meshed with their desire of capturing the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage. Moore had just purchased a high-end Calrec Ambisonic microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000, and would soon have it delivered. The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the Crawford Street house and rehearsal space on June 26, 1986 and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording. Except for a bad moment when the microphone got knocked on the floor, the recording session went smoothly, recording the sound on standard Betamax tapes. Moore placed a mattress in front of the drums to prevent them from over-powering the other instruments. He had Margo sing through a PA to have an electrified voice go with the electric guitars. The Cowboy Junkies shopped their material around for a bit, but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they created their own indie label, Latent Recordings, to release the recording in October 1986.  Reception  The Cowboy Junkies had to distribute the album themselves, but managed to sell four thousand copies, and started to develop a cult following in Toronto. Their audience continued to grow in southern Ontario, and they started getting gigs throughout southern Canada and reaching into southern US by 1987. Whites Off Earth Now!! establishes the spare country blues sound that took the band to international fame with their next album, 1988's The Trinity Session. Due to the success of The Trinity Session this album has received far less critical attention over the years. The album was released on Latent Recordings in 1986, and re- released internationally on RCA Records in 1991. On March 27, 2007 audiophile label Mobile Fidelity reissued the album on SACD and high density vinyl.

The centered nonagonal number for n is given by the formula :Nc(n) = frac{(3n-2)(3n-1)}{2}. Multiplying the (n - 1)th triangular number by 9 and then adding 1 yields the nth centered nonagonal number, but centered nonagonal numbers have an even simpler relation to triangular numbers: every third triangular number (the 1st, 4th, 7th, etc.) is also a centered nonagonal number. Thus, the first few centered nonagonal numbers are :1, 10, 28, 55, 91, 136, 190, 253, 325, 406, 496, 595, 703, 820, 946. The list above includes the perfect numbers 28 and 496. All even perfect numbers are triangular numbers whose index is an odd Mersenne prime.. Since every Mersenne prime greater than 3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, it follows that every even perfect number greater than 6 is a centered nonagonal number.

Biography From 1800, Baudin served as a midshipman on Géographe and took part in her expedition to Australia. Baudin lost an arm in 1808 while serving in the Indian Ocean on Sémillante, during her battle against HMS Terpsichore.\\"L'Amiral Baudin\\" by Jurien De La Gravière, p.50 (590 on the file) to 53 (593) In 1812, as Lieutenant and Commander of the brig Renard off Genoa, he received the order to convey 14 munitions-laden cargo vessels to Toulon. Although he was pursued by English cruisers, he was able to take his squadron safely to St. Tropez, notably engaging HMS Swallow on 11 June. In Toulon he was promoted to Captain. After the battle of Waterloo he was prepared to lead his defeated Emperor Napoleon I through the midst of the English cruisers; Napoleon, however, could not make up his mind in time. After the Restoration, Baudin was forced into retirement, and in 1816 joined the merchant marine. Under the July Monarchy, however, he returned to military service. In 1838, he became a Rear Admiral and became Commander-in-Chief of the squadron sent to Mexico during the so- called \\"Pastry War.\\" In this conflict he commanded the French forces at the Battle of Veracruz on 27 November 1838, against the fort of Vera Cruz, San Juan de Ulúa. The fort gave itself up the next day. In January 1839, Baudin was named a Vice Admiral and in the following year he was entrusted with a military and diplomatic mission to Buenos Aires. He also received command over the fleet in South American waters. In 1841, he took over the Ministry of Marine, but quickly resigned and became maritime prefect in Toulon. In 1848, after the February Revolution, he became commander-in-chief of France's Mediterranean Fleet. In this position, he took part in the Battle of Lazzaroni and of troops against Naples, and then moved toward Sicily, where he was defeated by the forces of Carlo Filangieri. In 1849, Baudin returned with his family to Ischia, where he died on 7 June 1854. Not long beforehand, he had been named a full Admiral.

Released on February 27, 1996, it was the group's first album for Geffen Records after the end of their contract with RCA Records. It was the band's first album that could be described as straight-ahead rock, rather than country rock, country or blues. It was also their first album consisting entirely of original material, with no covers. \\"A Common Disaster\\" and \\"Speaking Confidentially\\" were notable hits for the band on Canadian radio. The album also includes two versions of the track \\"Come Calling\\", which is presented in male and female versions representing two sides of a relationship of an elderly couple, dealing with the pain and anguish of Alzheimer's disease. The \\"Angel Mine\\" music video, featuring Janeane Garofalo, was filmed at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The song \\"Hold on to Me\\" was used in the soundtrack of the 1998 film Homegrown.  Album development  The Junkies chose to step outside of Toronto to make Lay It Down. They looked for a location that was remote, but a comfortable drive from Toronto, and found Rock Island on Lake Kashabog, which was an island with one house on it. The Junkies visited the house one week at a time, spending time chopping wood, cooking, boating, and hiking, and also working on songs that had the same laid back feeling that the location had. A local person who ferried supplies and equipment over to the island was a gentleman that they knew as Zolt. Zolt had fought in the Korean war on the communist flight, flying MIGs for the Bulgarian Air Force. He and his wife came over to the west in the 60s, and settled at Lake Kashabog. Unfortunately, latter in life, Zolt's wife developed Alzheimer's and had to be hospitalized. Their story became the basis for the song \\"Come Calling\\", one performed uptempo from the man's perspective as the survivor, and one performed more subdued, from the woman's perspective as the stricken. When the band was ready to record the music, they looked for a studio that had the same vibe as Rock Island, with a sense of relaxed but focused mood, and a remoteness from the music industry. In Athens, Georgia, they found John Keane and his studio in a big-porched southern house. Keane was selected by the band for his laid-back, independent approach to recording, and also for an impressive resume of artists he had previously worked for. After touring with an expanded cast for the last three albums, the Cowboy Junkies felt a desire to pare back down to a foursome for their next work. The Junkies decided to focus on recording as a four-piece for this album, with Michael Timmins doing all the guitar work. Additional instrumentation was kept to a minimum, although the band introduced strings for the first time, on four of the tracks. Keane's assistant David Henry also played cello who recorded solo tracks and with the string quartet. Henry also toured with the band after the album's release. With the band's history of recording as a whole instead of individually, they wanted to record the strings in the same manner, in order to create a sound of playing with the band instead of just adding more sound. Andy Carlson wrote the arrangements and led the quartet with him on violin, Henry on Cello, Carl Schab also on violin, and Peter Schab on viola. The Junkies kind of let the quartet take over on \\"Speaking Confidentially\\". After the basic tracks were done, Michael Timmins spent a week doing guitar overdubs, and Margo followed up by doing vocal doubling and accompaniments, with Keane mixing the tracks into a whole.

Garlick went on trial to Waterford United in 1994. Initially for a month he stayed for two seasons before returning home in the hope of signing for a MLS club. Garlick was not initially drafted by an MLS team; instead, he signed with the Greensboro Dynamo of the USISL. D.C. United called him up early in the 1997 MLS season, and then signed him for good later in the year. Garlick promptly backstopped DC to the MLS Cup, but the emergence of Tom Presthus led United to trade Garlick to the Tampa Bay Mutiny prior to the 1999 season. Garlick spent two and a half seasons in Tampa, until he was traded to the Colorado Rapids in a deal that saw him packaged with Carlos Valderrama. He left Tampa as the team's all-time leader in most goalkeeping categories. Garlick spent two and a half seasons with the Rapids as well, but the arrival of Joe Cannon and Scott's subsequent controversial benching for the 2003 playoffs opened the door for his departure. He was traded to the Dallas Burn prior to the 2004 season. Although Garlick began the season as the starter, he lost his job to Jeff Cassar down the stretch.

During his criminal career, Scarfo had a murderous reputation, also engaging in organized crime activities such as drug trafficking and gambling. In 1988, he was convicted of multiple charges including conspiracy, racketeering and first degree murder. His trial was met with damaging testimonies of several informants, who had carried out his murders, and his top lieutenants including his second in command and nephew, Philip \\"Crazy Phil\\" Leonetti. Scarfo died in prison on January 13, 2017, while serving his 55-year sentence. He is also the father of Nicky Scarfo Jr., a Lucchese family soldier, who was sentenced in 2015, to 30 years in prison for security fraud, racketeering, and illegal gambling. Early life Scarfo was born on March 8, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York, to Philip and Catherine Scarfo, Italian immigrants from Naples and Calabria. At the age of 12, Scarfo and his family moved to South Philadelphia, where he worked as a young laborer and later graduated at Benjamin Franklin High School in 1947.via Associated Press. \\"Nicodemo Scarfo, ex-Philadelphia mob boss, dies in prison\\", Utica Observer-Dispatch, January 17, 2017. Accessed July 22, 2019. \\"Scarfo graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in 1947, where classmates voted him 'loudest,' 'most talkative' and 'best cutter'.\\" He became an amateur boxer, fighting in small clubs throughout Philadelphia, earning himself a reputation for his aggressive temper in the ring. After failing to become a success in the boxing world, Scarfo joined his uncle Nicky Buck, a Philly Mob soldier, in illegal activities in Philadelphia. He also worked as a bartender at a club owned by his uncle and was apprenticed by him and his two brothers. Criminal years In 1954, Scarfo was proposed for membership into the Philadelphia crime family. He was inducted by then boss Joseph Ida at a ceremony held in New Jersey, alongside two of his uncles who were also inducted as full-fledged soldiers. Scarfo was reportedly arrogant and stubborn, having declined to marry the daughter of Consigliere Joe Rugnetta, leaving him embarrassed and disrespected, briefly causing friction within the family. In 1963, Scarfo pleaded guilty to manslaughter for fatally stabbing a longshoreman; he spent about six months in prison. After his release, he was sent to Atlantic City, New Jersey by Angelo Bruno to oversee the operations there. Scarfo served almost two years in prison from 1971 to 1973 for refusing to testify for the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation.http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/ocbars2.pdf He served his time with boss Angelo Bruno and Genovese crime family members Gerardo Catena and Louis Manna, the latter of whom he formed a close relationship with. In 1976, Atlantic City legalized gambling, and Scarfo prioritized gambling as his main source of income. At the time he was dispatched to Atlantic City, it was considered a backwater. However, its rise as a gambling mecca made Scarfo a powerhouse. His cement contracting company, which was shared with his nephew, Scarf, Inc, received good business as developers built new casinos in Atlantic City; Scarfo would intimidate businesses into buying from his company, including Donald Trump. In 1978, Scarfo and his associate, Nicholas \\"Nick the Blade\\" Virgilio, shot and murdered judge Edwin J. Helfant for refusing to cooperate with them and to help Virgilio receive a lighter sentence as he was facing murder charges, in exchange for $12,500. Scarfo acted as the getaway driver. Meanwhile, Virgilio fired numerous rounds into the judge as he dined with his wife in a restaurant. He made it a public execution and made him an example to anyone that wasn't willing to give him what he wanted. In 1979, criminal associate and contractor Vincent Falcone was shot twice and killed by Phil Leonetti on orders of Scarfo after making negative remarks about the company and Scarfo. Power struggle Longtime Boss Angelo Bruno was murdered in 1980. His murder was orchestrated by his Consigliere, Antonio Caponigro. Weeks later, Caponigro faced the consequence of killing a Boss without the approval of the American Mafia Commission. He was found shot dozens of times in a car trunk and $300 in bills were jammed in his mouth and anus as a sign of his own greed. Phil Testa became the new Boss of the Philadelphia crime family, appointing Scarfo as his Consigliere. However, his tenure as Boss would be a short one. Testa was killed by a nail bomb under his porch in 1981, on orders of his Underboss and drug trafficker Peter Casella and Capo Frank Narducci Sr., which later resulted in Narducci being gunned down and Casella being banished from the Mob and fleeing to Florida. Testa's murder sparked a war within the family. Scarfo seized the top position for himself, promoting his nephew as his Underboss and Frank Monte as his Consigliere. Scarfo would go on to lead the family for a decade with a bloody rampage, fueled by paranoia and aggression. Between August 1982 and January 1984, Scarfo was imprisoned in a Texas penitentiary for gun possession. During that time, aging Capo Harry Riccobene began to form another faction that opposed Scarfo. The war would cost him his little brother's life, his brother Mario to become a government informant and Riccobene himself to be given a life sentence for first degree murder. In 1984, Scarfo ordered the death of Salvatore Testa, one of his Capos and top hitmen, as Testa's ambition and growing popularity made Scarfo feel threatened. Testa was the son of former Boss Phil Testa, who had been Scarfo's close friend and mentor. As a result of Salvatore Testa's murder, Scarfo gained a reputation for disloyalty, and several criminal organizations across the United States began to distrust him. Downfall of Scarfo In 1985, Scarfo plotted to extort $1 million from major commercial developer Willard Rouse, sending his soldier Nicholas Caramandi and another associate to do it. Rouse refused and immediately contacted the FBI. The FBI began a case to tackle Scarfo, sending an undercover agent to pose as a representative of Rouse. This led Caramandi, a notable and feared hitman, to cooperate and testify against the organization. In 1986, Caramandi was indicted for his role in the extortion case and decided to testify in court. Between 1987 and 1989, Scarfo was convicted three times—for conspiracy, racketeering, and first-degree murder, being sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 14 years, 55 years and life, although the life sentence was later overturned. His nephew, Phil Leonetti, also testified against him after facing a 45-year prison sentence, in 1989. During the trial that had ensued, Scarfo's son, Mark Scarfo attempted suicide on November 1, 1988. Mark, then only 17 years old, had been taunted for years by classmates about his father's criminal activities. Increasingly despondent over his father's possible imprisonment, Mark Scarfo hanged himself in the office of his father's concrete supply company in Atlantic City. He was discovered by his mother, and paramedics were able to resuscitate him. He suffered cardiac arrest and his brain was deprived of oxygen. He entered a coma where he remained until his death in April 2014.Sheehan, Kathy. \\"Scarfo's Son 'Put Through Hell'.\\" Philadelphia Daily News.

Pythia told her: \\"τὰς Μούσας θεραπεύειν\\", which means \\"serve the Muses\\", and Telesilla devoted herself to poetry. Defence of Argos When Cleomenes, king of Sparta, invaded the land of the Argives in c. 494 BC, he defeated and killed all the hoplites of Argos in the Battle of Sepeia, and massacred the survivors. Thus when Cleomenes led his troops to Argos there were no warriors left to defend it. According to Pausanias, Telesilla stationed on the wall all the slaves and all the males normally exempt from military service owing to their youth or old age. Also, she collected the arms from sanctuaries and homes, armed the women and put them in battle position.Pausanias: Description of Greece, ARGOLIS- 2.20.9 \\"But Telesilla mounted on the wall all the slaves and such as were incapable of bearing arms through youth or old age, and she herself, collecting the arms in the sanctuaries and those that were left in the houses, armed the women of vigorous age, and then posted them where she knew the enemy would attack.\\" When the Spartans appeared, they made a battle cry to scare Telesilla and the other women, but Telesilla's army didn't scare, stood their ground and fought valiantly.Pausanias: Description of Greece, ARGOLIS- 2.20.9 \\"When the Lacedaemonians came on, the women were not dismayed at their battle-cry, but stood their ground and fought valiantly.\\" The Lacedaemonians, realizing that to destroy the women would be an invidious success while defeat would mean a shameful disaster, left the city.Pausanias: Description of Greece, ARGOLIS- 2.20.9 \\"Then the Lacedaemonians, realizing that to destroy the women would be an invidious success while defeat would mean a shameful disaster, gave way before the women.\\" Polyaenus writes that her army repulsed Cleomenes, and the other king Damaratus (), and saved the city.Polyaenus, Strategems, 8.68.1 According to Pausanias, at Argos there was a statue in relief in front of the temple of Aphrodite dedicated to Telesilla. The statue depicted a woman who holds in her hand a helmet, which she is looking at and is about to place on her head and books lying at her feet.Pausanias: Description of Greece, ARGOLIS- 2.20.8 \\"Above the theater is a sanctuary of Aphrodite, and before the image is a slab with a representation wrought on it in relief of Telesilla, the lyric poetess. Her books lie scattered at her feet, and she herself holds in her hand an helmet, which she is looking at and is about to place on her head.\\" This stele has also been described as depicting her throwing away her books and putting a helmet on her head, as a memory to her action.Suda Encyclopedia, tau.260 The festival Hybristica or Endymatia, in which men and women exchanged clothes, also celebrated the heroism of her female compatriots. However, the statue seen by Pausanias may not have been intended for Telesilla; it would equally represent Aphrodite, in her character as consort of Ares and a warlike goddess (the books, however, seem out of place). The Hybristica, again, was most probably a religious festival connected with the worship of some androgynous divinity. Polyaenus writes that in memory of the women's success, the Argives celebrate a festival at the start of the month of Hermaeus. At the festival the women wear men's clothes, and the men women's clothes. Historicity Herodotus (vi. 76) does not refer to the intervention of Telesilla, but mentions an oracle, told by a Pythian priestess, which predicted that the female should conquer the male, whence the tradition itself may have been derived. This oracle is also quoted by Pausanias. The oracle was: :\\"But when the time shall come that the female conquers in battle, :Driving away the male, and wins great glory in Argos, :Then many wives of the Argives shall tear both cheeks in their mourning;\\" The existence of Telesilla and her poetry are unquestioned, but it is difficult to take Pausanias's account of her role in the abortive post-Sepeia siege of Argos at face value. Of all our sources on Telesilla and the aftermath of Sepeia, Pausanias is the most remote in time from the events in question. He viewed a much changed Argive cityscape, and heard stories that were susceptible to exaggeration or muddling of details. On the other hand, even if her role is not quite as Pausanias described it, the information gathered in his visit there proves that Telesilla had a great influence over an important event in Argive history that was still remembered more than half a millennium later. While disputing the exaggerated dramatic description of women and armed slaves mounting a probably non-existent wall as reported Pausanias, RA Tomlinson thinks that Telesilla could have played a pivotal role in overseeing the distribution of reserve arms from the temples of Argos and organizing a display of readiness that helped convince the Spartans not to attack the city of Argos itself. The story, even if it is incorrect on details, probably preserves a memory of a time of upheaval and social change. The relief of her described by Pausanias shows that the Argives still remembered her for her role in saving the city, even if the details were confused. Based on his studies of the archaeology of Argos and the analysis of other historians, Tomlinson questions the historicity of Pausanias's account, noting that it is not clear from the archaeological record that the lower city of Argos was walled at this point in time.RA Tomlinson, Argos and the Argolid: From the End of the Bronze Age to the Roman Occupation (Ithaca, N.Y. : Cornell University Press, 1972) Nevertheless, an assault on even the unwalled city itself by the Spartans, besides violating taboos against attacking women, would have potentially been very costly to them. For though the city may have lacked walls, it was protected on the west side by fortified hills, with a number of temples and other civic edifices that could double as strong points, and most of the streets were essentially very narrow alleys densely lined with housing and open sewers. The Spartan army was optimized for fighting in close order on an open battlefield, not for urban warfare. Besides having no room for massed infantry tactics and manoeuvre, there was no reliable way for hoplites to defend themselves against missiles hurled from rooftops. Tomlinson states that it was not unusual in this time period for a Greek a city, walled or otherwise, to be defended by women in this manner when attacked, noting that Pyrrhus of Epirus later failed in his Siege of Sparta, another unwalled city, and shortly afterwards was killed in his unsuccessful attack on Argos after being knocked unconscious by a roof tile hurled down by the mother of one of the armed male defenders. Unlike Pyrrhus, the Spartans were intelligent enough to avoid this kind of costly fighting; in addition, they were probably keen to keep some semblance of political order in Argos in order to keep it as a buffer state against Athens. Tomlinson also notes that although Herodotus describes Argos after the battle as \\"emptied of men\\" and controlled by the \\"slaves\\", this likely means that the entire body of landowning male citizens of military age were killed, but not nearly all the men, as Argos was divided into a society of hoplites, craftsmen, and gymentes farmers at this time. As for the slaves, the term doulos used by Pausanias could mean 'slave', or simply \\"worker\\", and it is likely that in this instance it referred to the gymnetes, a large body of disenfranchised free agricultural workers of the Argolid, not strictly speaking \\"slaves\\" who were bought and sold, in this he cites the evidence of Plutarch, who corrected Herodotus. If so, like the wall, this would be another anachronism from Pausanias's time in which both the physical nature of Argos and its social organization and settlement patterns had changed. Aristotle called the douloi of contemporary Argos the perioikoi, \\"the outdwellers\\", a term that at Sparta referred to the free population of non-citizens outside the city. These douloi seized Tiryns, according to Herodotus, but afterwards there was a period of cooperation between them and the \\"Argives\\", until the prophet Cleander exhorted the former to rise up and fight. A civil war ensued, with the end result that the Argives re-conquered the Argolid. Tomlinson interprets this as a time of Argive revanchism when the sons of the former ruling class who were wiped out at Sepeia grew up and reached military age, but also the beginning of a long period of turmoil which led to the end of the Argive oligarchy and the beginning of a transition to democracy, less radical than Athens, but including a larger proportion of the free male population of the Argolid than was formerly the case. Many of the douloi had married the widows of the fallen hoplites, which set the city up for ongoing conflict between the heirs of the deceased former landowning class on the one hand, and the children of these second marriages and the propertyless farmers on the other.This conflict continued even after the civil war ended, and flared up again in the ensuing centuries, most notably during the Skytalismos, a political purge in which 1,200 rich citizens were massacred by clubbing. Although none of these were an instance of slave rebellion strictly defined, they would have evoked much the same reaction of alarm and contempt from aristocratic writers, and the arming of propertyless farm workers in large numbers and as anything but light troops would have been an unusual and remarkable event in Greece at that time. Other Lucian at his work Amores mentions that after Telesilla's victory against Spartans, Ares (the God of War) was held at Argos among the gods of the women.http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/lucian-amores.htm Telesilla, who armed herself against the Spartiates, and because of whom Ares is numbered at Argos among the gods of the women,... Pausanias also, mentions that Telesilla mentions in an ode the sanctuary of Artemis which is on top of Mount Coryphum in Epidaurus. He also states that the old boundary between the destroyed Argive city of Asine and the territory of Epidaurus may have been a twisted olive tree midway up the mountain.Pausanias: Description of Greece, ARGOLIS- 2.28.2 \\"On the Top of the mountain there is a sanctuary of Artemis Coryphaea (of the Peak), of which Telesilla mention in an ode.\\" According to Tatian, Telesilla was commemorated by a statue in the Theatre of Pompey, a work of Niceratus.One Hundred Greek Sculptors, Their Careers and Extant Works 2.5, citing Tatian, Oratio ad Graecos 33 References Further reading * David Campbell, Greek Lyric IV (Loeb Classical Library, 1992), pp. 70–83. * Reginald Walter Macan, Herodotus iv.–vi., i. 336 foll. and notes. * Pausanias ii. 20, 8 * Plutarch, De Virtut.

Everett mansion on Euclid Avenue (since demolished), designed by Charles F. Schweinfurth Euclid Avenue is a major street in Cleveland, Ohio. It runs northeasterly from Public Square in Downtown Cleveland, through the cities of East Cleveland, Euclid and Wickliffe, to the suburb of Willoughby as a part of U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 6. The street passes Playhouse Square, University Circle, Cleveland State University, the Cleveland Clinic, Severance Hall, Case Western Reserve University’s Maltz Performing Arts Center (formerly The Temple Tifereth Israel ), Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Case Medical Center. The HealthLine bus rapid transit line runs in designated bus lanes in the median of Euclid Avenue from Public Square to Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. It received nationwide attention from the 1860s to the 1920s for its beauty and wealth, including a string of mansions that came to be known as Millionaires' Row. There are several theaters, banks, and churches along Euclid, as well as Cleveland's oldest extant building, the Dunham Tavern. A large reconstruction project, which brought the HealthLine to the street, was completed in 2008. Millionaires' Row In the second half of the 19th century and early in the 20th century, Euclid Avenue was internationally known. Baedeker's Travel Guides called the elm-lined avenue \\"The Showplace of America\\", and designated it as a must see for travelers from Europe. The concentration of wealth was unparalleled; the tax valuation of the mansions along \\"the Avenue\\" far exceeded the valuation of New York's Fifth Avenue in the late 19th century. Accounts at the time compared it to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris and the Unter den Linden in Berlin. Families living along \\"Millionaires' Row\\" included those of John D. Rockefeller (during the period, 1868–84), Sylvester T. Everett, Isaac N. Pennock I (inventor of the first steel railway car in the US), arc light inventor Charles F. Brush, George Worthington, Horace Weddell, Marcus Hanna, Ambrose Swasey, Amasa Stone, John Hay (personal secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State under William McKinley), Jeptha Wade (Cleveland benefactor and founder of Western Union Telegraph), Alfred Atmore Pope (iron industrialist and art collector), Charles E.J. Lang (automobile industrialist), Worthy S. Streator (railroad baron, coal mine developer, and founder of the city of Streator, Illinois), Mary Corinne Quintrell (clubwoman), and Charles Lathrop Pack. Euclid Avenue's most infamous resident was con artist Cassie Chadwick, the wife of Leroy Chadwick, who was unaware that his wife was passing herself off to bankers as the illegitimate daughter of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. Architect Charles F. Schweinfurth designed at least 15 mansions on the street. Samuel Mather's Mansion, built around 1910, \\"was among the last\\" to be built on Euclid Avenue.Eyle, p. 40 The Mather Mansion remains as part of Cleveland State University, but most of the homes were later demolished. Samuel Andrews mansion, built in 1882-85 and demolished in 1923 Growth of commercial district and decline of Millionaires' Row Charles Lathrop Pack is credited with at least part of the development of Euclid Avenue, on which he lived from about 1888 to the early years of the 20th century, into a thriving business district. According to Eyle, \\"In 1913, an article about Charles reported that 'inside of ten years...the [one-story, commercial buildings that he had developed at the lower end of Euclid Avenue] have disappeared. In their stead are skyscrapers, great retail establishments, magnificent banks, and a hotel that cost $2,000,000. Much of the land is owned by Mr. Pack and is leased for long periods. He helped to organize the companies which erected the buildings. It is said that his rentals, out of which not a penny is subtracted for taxes or anything else, amount to $100,000 a year.\\"Morrow, James B. January 5, 1913. \\"No sentiment, just plain common sense made him the first active worker for forest conservation,\\" Sunday Plain Dealer, editorial and drama section. Quoted in Eyle, p. 40 As Cleveland's commercial district began to push eastward along Euclid Avenue, families moved east towards University Circle. However, southeast of University Circle, the topography of the area rises sharply into what is referred to as \\"The Heights,\\" and the development of Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights, along with more efficient means of travel, became more attractive than the increasingly commercialized Euclid Avenue. By the 1920s, the former \\"Millionaires' Row\\" was in decline. During the Great Depression, many mansions were converted by their owners into rooming houses, which accelerated the decline. In the 1950s, Cleveland's Innerbelt Freeway cut through the Euclid Avenue neighborhood between downtown and the rail crossing at East 55th Street. By the 1960s, the street that once rivaled Fifth Avenue as the most expensive address in America was a two-mile (3 km) long slum of commercial buildings and substandard housing. In the late 1960s, Cleveland Cavaliers owner Nick Mileti announced plans to move the basketball club from Euclid Avenue's Cleveland Arena to a new arena in suburban Richfield Township. Playhouse Square faces Euclid Avenue. Legacies and redevelopment Eight houses from the era remain on Euclid, including the Samuel Mather and Howe mansions owned and used by Cleveland State University. One of the most recent to be demolished was the Lyman Treadway Mansion, which served as part of the Cleveland Museum of Health from the 1930s until it was razed in 2002 for a new museum building. The Euclid Avenue Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On August 5, 1914, the American Traffic Signal Company installed a traffic signal system on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue, the first traffic light installed in the United States. =Theaters of Playhouse Square= In their 1949 musical South Pacific, Rodgers and Hammerstein indirectly acknowledged the street's fame. In the script, Captain Brackett sends a grass skirt to one \\"Amelia Fortuna, 325 Euclid Avenue, Shaker Heights, Cleveland, Ohio\\". Theaters on Euclid include the Allen Theatre, State Theatre, Ohio Theatre, and Palace Theater. Recent events Euclid Avenue during the construction of the Euclid Corridor project In April 2006, parts of Euclid Avenue were closed to traffic for the filming of a scene from the film Spider-Man 3. No major stars were on location, but the filming drew thousands of gawkers. Most of the filming involved explosions and destroyed cars, with hired extras walking the sidewalks. The sections of the street that were closed off were redressed to resemble a city street in New York City, complete with magazine stands and poster-covered walls. The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority completely refurbished the western section of Euclid Avenue as part of the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project, which opened fully in 2008. A bus rapid transit line, the HealthLine, now runs from Public Square to the Stokes Rapid Transit station in East Cleveland, which is the eastern terminus of the Red Line rapid transit route. The refurbishing also entailed development - , more than $3.3 billion worth of completed or proposed urban renewal projects lined the street and surrounding area.

Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications. The nitride ion, N3−, is never encountered in protic solution because it is so basic that it would be protonated immediately. Its ionic radius is estimated to be 140 pm. Uses of nitrides Like carbides, nitrides are often refractory materials owing to their high lattice energy which reflects the strong attraction of \\"N3−\\" for the metal cation. Thus, titanium nitride and silicon nitride are used as cutting materials and hard coatings. Hexagonal boron nitride, which adopts a layered structure, is a useful high-temperature lubricant akin to molybdenum disulfide. Nitride compounds often have large band gaps, thus nitrides are usually insulators or wide bandgap semiconductors; examples include boron nitride and silicon nitride. The wide band gap material gallium nitride is prized for emitting blue light in LEDs. Like some oxides, nitrides can absorb hydrogen and have been discussed in the context of hydrogen storage, e.g. lithium nitride. Examples Classification of such a varied group of compounds is somewhat arbitrary. Compounds where nitrogen is not assigned −3 oxidation state are not included, such as nitrogen trichloride where the oxidation state is +3; nor are ammonia and its many organic derivatives. =Nitrides of the s-block elements= Only one alkali metal nitride is stable, the purple-reddish lithium nitride (Li3N), which forms when lithium burns in an atmosphere of N2. Sodium nitride has been generated, but remains a laboratory curiosity. The nitrides of the alkaline earth metals have the formula M3N2 are however numerous. Examples include Be3N2, Mg3N2, Ca3N2, and Sr3N2. The nitrides of electropositive metals (including Li, Zn, and the alkaline earth metals) readily hydrolyze upon contact with water, including the moisture in the air: :Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 + 2 NH3 =Nitrides of the p-block elements= Boron nitride exists as several forms (polymorphs). Nitrides of silicon and phosphorus are also known, but only the former is commercially important. The nitrides of aluminium, gallium, and indium adopt diamond-like wurtzite structure in which each atom occupies tetrahedral sites. For example, in aluminium nitride, each aluminium atom has four neighboring nitrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron and similarly each nitrogen atom has four neighboring aluminium atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. This structure is like hexagonal diamond (lonsdaleite) where every carbon atom occupies a tetrahedral site (however wurtzite differs from sphalerite and diamond in the relative orientation of tetrahedra). Thallium(I) nitride, Tl3N is known, but thallium(III) nitride, TlN, is not. =Transition metal nitrides= For the group 3 metals, ScN and YN are both known. Group 4, 5, and 6 transition metals (the titanium, vanadium and chromium groups) all form nitrides. They are refractory, with high melting point and are chemically stable. Representative is titanium nitride. Sometimes these materials are called \\"interstitial nitrides.\\" Nitrides of the group 7 and 8 transition metals decompose readily. For example, iron nitride, Fe2N decomposes at 200 °C. Platinum nitride and osmium nitride may contain N2 units, and as such should not be called nitrides. Nitrides of heavier members from group 11 and 12 are less stable than copper nitride, Cu3N and Zn3N2: dry silver nitride (Ag3N) is a contact explosive which may detonate from the slightest touch, even a falling water droplet. =Molecular nitrides= S4N4 is a prototypical binary molecular nitride. Many metals form molecular nitrido complexes, as discussed in the specialized article. The main group elements also form some molecular nitrides. Cyanogen ((CN)2) and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4) are rare examples of a molecular binary (containing one element aside from nitrogen) nitrides. They dissolve in nonpolar solvents. Both undergo polymerization. S4N4 is also unstable with respect to the elements, but less so that the isostructural Se4N4. Heating S4N4 gives a polymer, and a variety of molecular sulfur nitride anions and cations are also known. Related to but distinct from nitride is pernitride, .

It consists of songs mostly drawn from Please Please Me, their first LP released in the United Kingdom. This album, like its parent album, contains both original Beatles songs, as well as covers (including its namesake, \\"Twist and Shout\\"), denoted in the track listing. Track listing Differences from Please Please Me *\\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" (the opening track of Please Please Me) and \\"Misery\\" were omitted from Twist and Shout. They both appear on the next Canadian LP release, The Beatles' Long Tall Sally. *\\"From Me to You\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" were added to Twist and Shout. They were issued as the A-sides of singles in the UK. * The two albums' front and back covers differ significantly. Reissues Twist and Shout received miscellaneous reissues since the initial release date. The initial release was exclusively mono audio, because stereo record players were not popular in Canada at the time of release and therefore not profitable. Early copies of the record were manufactured with a limited edition 8x10 inch poster of the Beatles. The subsequent reissues attributed Parr's, the printer commissioned by Capitol to create the cardboard record jackets as well as other minor variations in the label, font size, and catalogue numbers. Twist and Shout was eventually reissued in stereo in the 1970s, bearing catalogue number ST-6054 to denote stereo audio; all tracks were in stereo except for \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"P.S. I Love You\\", and \\"She Loves You\\", which remained mono. The stereo reissue is considered to be the definitive version.

They can be physical data rooms, virtual data rooms, or data centers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including data storage, document exchange, file sharing, financial transactions, legal transactions, and more. In mergers and acquisitions, the traditional data room will literally be a physically secure continually monitored room, normally in the vendor’s offices (or those of their lawyers), which the bidders and their advisers will visit in order to inspect and report on the various documents and other data made available. Often only one bidder at a time will be allowed to enter and if new documents or new versions of documents are required these will have to be brought in by courier as hardcopy. Teams involved in large due diligence processes will typically have to be flown in from many regions or countries and remain available throughout the process. Such teams often comprise a number of experts in different fields and so the overall cost of keeping such groups on call near to the data room is often extremely high. Combating the significant cost of physical datarooms is the virtual data room, which provides for the secure, online dissemination of confidential information. A virtual data room (VDR) is essentially a website with limited controlled access (using a secure log-on supplied by the vendor/authority which can be disabled at any time by the vendor/authority if a bidder withdraws) to which the bidders and their advisers are given access. Much of the information released will be confidential and restrictions should be applied to the viewers' ability to release this to third parties by forwarding, copying or printing.

He was employed on several peace missions; he represented the Protestants before the king, and was entrusted by Condé with the presentation of his terms to the queen-mother Catherine in 1567, and in the following year he assisted at the conference at Châlons and signed the Peace of Longjumeau, which was destined to be of short duration. On the outbreak of war, he took part in the siege of Poitiers, directed an unsuccessful attack on Nantes, fought bravely under Coligny at Moncontour, and participated in the negotiations ending in the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (8 August 1570). In 1571 he retired to La Rochelle and married Louise de Coligny, but was speedily recalled to Paris to serve on the bi-partisan commission of adjustment. Although he won the special favour of Charles IX, he became one of the first victims in the massacre of St Bartholomew's Day. He was murdered in the halls of the Louvre after refusing to recant his Protestant beliefs.

In organic chemistry, an electrophilic addition reaction is an addition reaction where, in a chemical compound, a π bond is broken and two new σ bonds are formed. The substrate of an electrophilic addition reaction must have a double bond or triple bond.March, Jerry; (1985). Advanced Organic Chemistry reactions, mechanisms and structure (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley & Sons, inc. The driving force for this reaction is the formation of an electrophile X+ that forms a covalent bond with an electron-rich unsaturated C=C bond. The positive charge on X is transferred to the carbon-carbon bond, forming a carbocation during the formation of the C-X bond. :Electrophilic addition mechanism In step 2 of an electrophilic addition, the positively charged intermediate combines with (Y) that is electron-rich and usually an anion to form the second covalent bond. Step 2 is the same nucleophilic attack process found in an SN1 reaction. The exact nature of the electrophile and the nature of the positively charged intermediate are not always clear and depend on reactants and reaction conditions. In all asymmetric addition reactions to carbon, regioselectivity is important and often determined by Markovnikov's rule. Organoborane compounds give anti-Markovnikov additions. Electrophilic attack to an aromatic system results in electrophilic aromatic substitution rather than an addition reaction. In Electrophilic addition the electrophile with the positive charge effects the formation of the total structure, which thus bears a positive charge as well, to make up for the new addition, which then results in the intermediate, bearing that positive charge. This intermediate is the key to understanding the electrophilic addition, which is due to the positive nature of the particles involved. If this is done, then the reactions can be understood by these additions as positively charged reactions. The positive charge bears result as the intermediate form otherwise known as the total structure of such an intermediate. The end product thus contains the complete structure, with the addition of Y, a nucleophile.  Typical electrophilic additions  Typical electrophilic additions to alkenes with reagents are: * dihalo addition reactions: X2 * Hydrohalogenations: HX * Hydration reactions: H2O * Hydrogenations: H2 * Oxymercuration reactions: mercuric acetate, water * Hydroboration-oxidation reactions: diborane * the Prins reaction: formaldehyde, water References Reaction mechanisms ","title":"Electrophilic addition"},{"id":"1216087","text":"right A centered decagonal number is a centered figurate number that represents a decagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive decagonal layers.

It was intended to indicate a cautious devolution of power to the local level in an attempt to better implement national goals. Labour's first term approach New localism arose from the experience of Labour's first term of office (1997–2001), during which the government's policy approach was characterised as being highly centralised and only partly effective. The most emblematic of its policies were the centrally-driven literacy and numeracy hours in schools. Labour also introduced new and more complex forms of performance management in an attempt to drive up the standard of local public services through inspection and target setting. In Whitehall, this was achieved through public service agreements between departments and the Treasury, setting out what was expected of a particular department in return for its funding. In the wider public sector, local government was required to undertake a heavy service review and inspection programme known as Best Value, while the NHS got a new Commission for Healthcare Inspection and a system of 'star rating' based league tables. However, these policies were rapidly seen to be too bureaucratic. Indeed, they could sometimes have perverse consequences as public service organisations changed their priorities to meet centrally set targets. One example of this is arguably the way the government's focus on education and social services drove councils to focus their spending and effort in these areas. While positive in itself, the result was that local environmental services were relatively less well resourced, despite the fact that they are key determinants of public satisfaction with local government. The result was that councils were seen to be improving rapidly by Whitehall, but not by the public, whose satisfaction with local government declined. New localism emerged from an increasing understanding of the limitations of centrally-driven policy implementation. It involved an acceptance that local problems could not be solved by standardised approaches imposed from above, and that local agencies needed space to adapt and innovate within the policy framework. New localism and 'old localism' New localism is therefore characterised by a cautious devolution of power to the local level in an attempt to better implement national goals. It emphasises the devolution of managerial over political power - the aim is generally to allow local managers to meet national priorities more effectively, rather than to allow local politicians to derogate from national goals. New localism differs from the implicit 'old localism' in two important senses. First, it accepts the role of central government in driving change at the local level, something that the localists of the 1980s strongly resisted. Second, it does not centre on the role of the local authority, but takes a wider view of the locality that includes communities and other public service organisations such as health and police services. New localism in practice New localism has been most strongly advocated by the New Local Government Network think tank. Advocates in the Labour government have included Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, and Hazel Blears. Nick Raynsford, the local government minister from 2001–2005, used his tenure to launch a process called Local:Vision, which aimed at creating a 10-year strategy for local government policy and took a distinctively new localist perspective. His successor, David Miliband developed this approach further, suggesting the continuing development of a new localist agenda in Labour's third term (which began in 2005). Key new localist policies include: Foundation hospitals - the granting of more autonomy to NHS hospital trusts that score the highest marks in their inspections, including freedom to borrow money on the markets and adjust staff pay levels. The foundation trusts must create an elected board including representatives from the local community to oversee their work. Freedoms for local government - Labour granted a number of new freedoms to councils, including the right to freely borrow capital on the financial markets and a general reduction in the number of plans that must be submitted for central government approval. Further freedoms were promised to those councils that scored the top 'excellent' grade in the key Comprehensive Performance Assessment inspection process. These include freedom from council tax capping and a three-year holiday from inspection. The local government community has complained that these freedoms are not always granted in practice. Neighbourhoods - Labour showed a growing interest in creating new forms of more direct neighbourhood governance in the hope of improving the responsiveness of public services and engaging local people in both local democracy and the delivery of their own services through service level contracts and co-production. Education reform - it might also be argued that the government's policy of transferring power to school headteachers from local education authorities represented a new localist approach to devolving beyond the council to local communities.

Produced for Paramount Pictures by Walter Wanger, who is not credited, the film stars the four Marx Brothers, Oscar Shaw, Mary Eaton, and Margaret Dumont. It was the first sound film to credit more than one director (Robert Florey and Joseph Santley), and was adapted to the screen by Morrie Ryskind from the George S. Kaufman Broadway musical play. Five of the film's tunes were composed by Irving Berlin, including \\"When My Dreams Come True\\", sung by Oscar Shaw and Mary Eaton. Plot The Cocoanuts is set in the Hotel de Cocoanut, a resort hotel, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Mr. Hammer (Groucho Marx) runs the place, assisted by Jamison (Zeppo Marx), who would rather sleep at the front desk than actually help him run it. Chico and Harpo arrive with empty luggage, which they apparently plan to fill by robbing and conning the guests. Mrs. Potter (Margaret Dumont, in the first of seven film appearances with the Marxes) is one of the few paying customers. Her daughter Polly (Mary Eaton) is in love with struggling young architect Bob Adams (Oscar Shaw). He works to support himself as a clerk at the hotel, but has plans for the development of the entire area as Cocoanut Manor. Mrs. Potter wants her daughter to marry Harvey Yates (Cyril Ring), whom she believes to be of higher social standing than the clerk. This suitor is actually a con man out to steal the dowager's diamond necklace with the help of his conniving partner Penelope (Kay Francis). Analysis The somewhat thin plot primarily provides a framework for the running gags of the Marx Brothers to take prominence. The film is, however, notable for its musical production numbers, including techniques which were soon to become standard, such as overhead shots of dancing girls imitating the patterns of a kaleidoscope. The musical numbers were not pre-recorded, but were shot live on the soundstage with an off-camera orchestra. The main titles are superimposed over a negative image of the \\"Monkey-Doodle-Do\\" number photographed from an angle that does not appear in the body of the film. One of the more famous gag routines in the film involves Chico not knowing what a \\"viaduct\\" is, which Groucho keeps mentioning, prompting Chico to ask, \\"why-a-duck\\". In another sequence, while he is acting as auctioneer for some land of possibly questionable value (\\"You can have any kind of a home you want to; you can even get stucco! Oh, how you can get stuck-oh!\\"), he has hired Chico to inflate the sale prices by making phony bids. To Groucho's frustration, Chico keeps outbidding everyone, even himself. During the auction, Mrs. Potter announces that her necklace has been stolen and offers a thousand dollar reward, whereupon Chico offers two thousand. Unbeknownst to anyone except the thieves and to Harpo (who intercepted the map drawn by the villains while hiding under their hotel room bed) the jewellery's hiding place is a hollow tree stump adjacent to where the land auction takes place. Thereupon, a detective who entered the plot earlier decides that the guilty party is Polly's suitor. He is aided in this by the real villains, who attempt to frame Bob Adams for the crime. However, Harpo, by producing the jewellery, and later the note, is able to prove that Bob Adams is innocent of the charges laid against him. At various points, Harpo and Chico both provide musical solos - Harpo on the harp, and Chico (introduced as 'Mr Pastrami') at the piano. Still another sequence has Groucho, Mrs. Potter and Harvey Yates (the necklace thief) make formal speeches. Harpo repeatedly walks off, with a grimace on his face, to the punch bowl. (His staggering implies that the fruit punch has been spiked with alcohol.) Another highlight is when the cast, already dressed in traditional Spanish garb for a theme party, erupts into an operatic treatment about a lost shirt to music from Carmen (specifically, Habanera and the Toreador Song). An earlier scene shows Harpo and Chico abusing a cash register while whistling the Anvil Chorus from Il trovatore, a piece also referenced in several other Marx Brothers films. Immediately following the revelation that an injustice has been done to Polly's original suitor, Bob Adams, Mr. Adams himself comes in saying there's a man outside asking for Mr. Hammer: it's tycoon John W. Berryman, who's about to buy Bob's architectural designs for Cocoanut Manor, and asking if the hotel can accommodate 400 guests for the weekend. The Marxes immediately beat a hasty retreat, and Mrs Potter declares the wedding will take place \\"exactly as planned, with the exception of a slight change,\\" announcing that Mr. Robert Adams will be the bridegroom.

Foster Girls  Production  Referring to directors Robert Florey and Joseph Santley, Groucho Marx remarked, \\"One of them didn't understand English and the other didn't understand Harpo.\\" As was common in the early days of sound film, to eliminate the sound of the camera motors the cameras and the cameramen were enclosed in large soundproof booths with glass fronts to allow filming, hence the largely static camera work. For many years, Marxian legend had it that Florey, who had never seen the Marxes' work before, was put in the soundproof booth because he could not contain his laughter at the brothers' spontaneous antics.Paul D. Zimmerman, The Marx Brothers At The Movies. Putnam, 1968, p. 17. Every piece of paper in the movie is soaking wet, in order to keep crackling paper sounds from overloading the primitive recording equipment of the time. In fact, this did not occur to director Florey until 27 takes had been made (of the \\"Viaduct\\" scene) and disposed of because of the noise made by the paper. Florey finally got the idea to soak the paper in water; the 28th take of the \\"Viaduct\\" scene used soaked paper, and this take was quiet and used in the film.Paul D. Zimmerman and Burt Goldblatt The Marx Brothers at the Movies. Putnam, 1968, p.26. The \\"ink\\" that Harpo drank from the hotel lobby inkwell was actually Coca-Cola, and the \\"telephone mouthpiece\\" that he nibbled was made of chocolate, both inventions of Robert Florey. Paramount brought conductor Frank Tours (1877-1963) over from London, where he was then conducting at the Plaza Theatre in Piccadilly Circus (Paramount's premier exhibition venue in the UK), to be the film's musical director as he had also been the conductor for the show's original Broadway production in 1925. Filming took place at Paramount's Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens. Their second film, Animal Crackers, was also shot there. After that, production of all Marx films moved to Hollywood.

Irving Berlin wrote two songs entitled \\"Monkey Doodle Doo\\". The first was published in 1913, the second introduced in the 1925 stage production and featured in the film. They are very different songs. Although legend claims Berlin wrote the song \\"Always\\" for The Cocoanuts, he never meant for the song to be included, writing it, instead, as a gift for his fiancée. Reception When the Marx Brothers were shown the final cut of the film, they were so horrified they tried to buy the negative back and prevent its release. Paramount wisely resisted — the movie turned out to be a big box office hit, with a $1,800,000 gross making it one of the most successful early talking films. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with the Marx Brothers themselves earning most of the praise while other aspects of the film drew a more mixed reaction. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times reported that the film \\"aroused considerable merriment\\" among the viewing audience, and that a sequence using an overhead shot was \\"so engaging that it elicited plaudits from many in the jammed theatre.\\" However, he found the audio quality during some of the singing to be \\"none too good\\", adding, \\"a deep-voiced bass's tones almost fade into a whisper in a close-up. Mary Eaton is charming, but one obtains little impression of her real ability as a singer.\\" Variety called it \\"a comedy hit for the regular picture houses. That's all it has – comedy – but that's enough.\\" It reported the sound had \\"a bit of muffling now and then\\" and that the dancers weren't always filmed well: \\"When the full 48 were at work only 40 could be seen and those behind the first line could be seen but dimly.\\" \\"It is as a funny picture and not as a musical comedy, not for its songs, pretty girls, or spectacular scenes, that The Cocoanuts succeeds\\", wrote John Mosher in The New Yorker. \\"Neither Mary Eaton, nor Oscar Shaw, who contribute the \\"love interest\\", is effective, nor are the chorus scenes in the least superior to others of the same sort in various musical-comedy-movies now running in town. To the Marxes belongs the success of the show, and their peculiar talents seem, surprisingly enough, even more manifest on the screen than on the stage.\\" Film Daily called it \\"a good amount of fun, although some of it proves tiresome. This is another case of a musical comedy transferred almost bodily to the screen and motion picture treatment forgotten. The result is a good many inconsistencies which perhaps may be overlooked provided the audience accepts the offering for what it is.\\" Accolades American Film Institute recognition • AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs – Nominated See also *\\"Why a Duck?\\" *List of American films of 1929 *List of United States comedy films References External links  *The Marx Brothers Council Podcast discussing \\"The Cocoanuts\\" 1929 films 1929 musical comedy films American films American musical comedy films English-language films American black-and-white films Marx Brothers (film series) Films made before the MPAA Production Code Films set in Florida Films set in hotels Paramount Pictures films Films directed by Robert Florey Films directed by Joseph Santley Films produced by Walter Wanger Films scored by Irving Berlin Films shot at Astoria Studios Films based on musicals 1929 comedy films ","title":"The Cocoanuts"},{"id":"1216097","title":"List of FIS Cross-Country World Cup champions"},{"id":"1216099","text":"The God gene hypothesis proposes that human spirituality is influenced by heredity and that a specific gene, called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), predisposes humans towards spiritual or mystic experiences. The idea has been proposed by geneticist Dean Hamer in the 2004 book called The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes. The God gene hypothesis is based on a combination of behavioral genetic, neurobiological and psychological studies. The major arguments of the hypothesis are: (1) spirituality can be quantified by psychometric measurements; (2) the underlying tendency to spirituality is partially heritable; (3) part of this heritability can be attributed to the gene VMAT2; (4) this gene acts by altering monoamine levels; and (5) spirituality provides an evolutionary advantage by providing individuals with an innate sense of optimism. Proposal According to the God Gene hypothesis, spirituality has a genetic component, of which (VMAT2) comprises one component by contributing to sensations associated with mystic experiences, including the presence of God and feelings of connection to a larger universe. The research uses the self-transcendence scale developed by psychologist Robert Cloninger to quantify spirituality using three sub-scales: \\"self-forgetfulness\\" (as in the tendency to become totally absorbed in some activity, such as reading); \\"transpersonal identification\\" (a feeling of connectedness to a larger universe); and \\"mysticism\\" (an openness to believe things that remain unproven, such as ESP). Cloninger suggests that taken together, these measurements are a reasonable way to quantify (make measurable) an individual's propensity to spiritual. The self-transcendence measure was shown to be heritable by classical twin studies conducted by Lindon Eaves and Nicholas Martin. Their work demonstrated that approximately 40% of the variation in self-transcendence was due to genes. By contrast, specific religious beliefs (such as belief in a particular deity) were found to have no genetic basis and are instead cultural units or memes. Similar conclusions were drawn from studies of identical twins reared apart. In order to identify some of the specific genes involved in self-transcendence, Hamer analyzed DNA and personality score data from over 1,000 individuals and identified one particular locus, VMAT2, with a significant correlation. VMAT2 codes for a vesicular monoamine transporter that plays a key role in regulating the levels of the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. These monoamine transmitters are in turn postulated to play an important role in regulating the brain activities associated with mystic beliefs. Hamer hypothesized that self-transcendence might provide an evolutionary advantage by providing human beings with an innate sense of optimism that gives people the will to keep on living and procreating, despite the inevitability of death, and promoting better health and recovery from diseases. Scientific response In the brain, VMAT2 proteins are located on synaptic vesicles. VMAT2 transports monoamine neurotransmitters from the cytosol of monoamine neurons into vesicles. Developmental biologist and science blogger PZ Myers argues: \\"It's a pump. A teeny-tiny pump responsible for packaging a neurotransmitter for export during brain activity. Yes, it's important, and it may even be active and necessary during higher order processing, like religious thought. But one thing it isn't is a 'god gene.'\\" Popular science writer Carl Zimmer claimed that VMAT2 can be characterized as a gene that accounts for less than one percent of the variance of self- transcendence scores. These, Zimmer says, can signify anything from belonging to the Green Party to believing in ESP. Zimmer also points out that the God Gene theory is based on only one unpublished, unreplicated study. However, Hamer notes that the importance of the VMAT2 finding is not that it explains all spiritual or religious feelings, but rather that it points the way toward one neurobiological pathway that may be important. Religious response John Polkinghorne, an Anglican priest, member of the Royal Society and Canon Theologian at Liverpool Cathedral, was asked for a comment on Hamer's theory by the British national daily newspaper, The Daily Telegraph. He replied: \\"The idea of a God gene goes against all my personal theological convictions. You can't cut faith down to the lowest common denominator of genetic survival. It shows the poverty of reductionist thinking.\\" The 'God Gene' Sales Stunt Geneticist claims to have found 'God gene' in humans Walter Houston, the chaplain of Mansfield College, Oxford, and a fellow in theology, told the Telegraph: \\"Religious belief is not just related to a person's constitution; it's related to society, tradition, character--everything's involved. Having a gene that could do all that seems pretty unlikely to me.\\" Hamer responded that the existence of such a gene would not be incompatible with the existence of a personal God: \\"Religious believers can point to the existence of God genes as one more sign of the creator's ingenuity--a clever way to help humans acknowledge and embrace a divine presence.\\" He repeatedly notes in his book that, \\"This book is about whether God genes exist, not about whether there is a God.\\"Hamer, Dean (2005).

He served as a member of David Lloyd George's cabinet, most significantly as Home Secretary from 1919 to 1922. Background and education Shortt was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and was the son of the Church of England vicar Rev. Edward Shortt of Woodhorn, Northumberland. Though born and bred in England, Shortt came from a family with roots in County Tyrone. Shortt was educated at Durham School, where he was a King's scholar and competed for the school boat club. He continued his education at the neighbouring Durham University, where he was Lindsay scholar at University College and for two years competed for Durham University Boat Club. He did not excel academically, taking a gentleman's degree in Classics in 1884. Shortt had three brothers. One, Dr William Rushton Shortt, was a surgeon who acted as a Civil Surgeon to the Natal Field Force during the Second Boer War and was present at the Relief of Ladysmith. However, his health having declined in South Africa, he was forced to retire early, and died in November 1913. An older brother, the Rev. Joseph Rushton Shortt (1860–1919), also studied at Durham as a member of Hatfield Hall, having previously attended Exeter College, Oxford – he went on to join the Durham University staff as a lecturer in Classics and was Bursar of Hatfield from 1889–1898. Legal career He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1890 and practised on the North Eastern Circuit. He soon acquired a large junior practice in both civil and criminal cases, with his 'breezy personality' making him an effective advocate in front of juries. His business being mostly in the North East, he was little known in London at this time. He was appointed as Recorder (part-time judge) of Sunderland in 1907 and took silk in 1910. Political career Shortt became active in politics for the Liberal Party. In 1908, Shortt was an unsuccessful candidate for Newcastle upon Tyne in a by-election, losing a seat previously held by the party when the Social Democratic Federation put up a candidate against him. However, in the January 1910 election he was elected, and remained an MP until 1922, transferring in 1918 to the new Newcastle upon Tyne West constituency. Within the Liberal Party, Shortt allied with David Lloyd George in the party split which occurred between him and H. H. Asquith. When Lloyd George came to power in 1916, Shortt was soon appointed to the government. =Chief Secretary of Ireland= Shortt took an active interest in Irish affairs and became known for his frequent interventions during the debates over the Third Home Rule Bill. His appointment to chair a Select committee to review the operation of the Military Service Acts proved to be the turning-point in his political career. The public hearings of this committee, with witness after witness coming forward to tell stories of medical and administrative chaos, caused a major political storm and sounded the end of the old system. In August 1917 the committee produced a report whose main recommendation was the transfer of medical examinations of recruits from the War Office to a civilian authority. This apparently impressed Lloyd George, and would lead to the advancement of Shortt's career after several years of relative obscurity in public life. In May 1918, Lloyd George appointed him as Chief Secretary for Ireland, at a pivotal stage in the First World War and when Irish Republicanism was on the increase. Taking to this new role with great energy and, suspicious of any alleged German intrigue to encourage sedition, he had 150 members of Sinn Féin arrested as a precaution. The government had also decided to introduce conscription in Ireland to provide more soldiers for the Western Front, linked to support for Irish home rule, but still found that opposition to the British increased. Shortt gave his support to an unusual plan to encourage Irish soldiers to join the French army, while persuading the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland to support conscription. However, both parts of the plan collapsed due to infighting within the government and the military establishment. Conscription was never implemented in Ireland. Pencil sketch of Edward Shortt by Reginald Grenville Eves =Home Secretary= Once the war was over, Shortt was promoted to Home Secretary in January 1919, during the middle of a police strike. On the issue of the fate of enemy aliens who had been detained on the outbreak of war, he resisted demands made by Charles Yate in February 1919 that all foreign waiters on strike should be immediately deported, arguing that 'the fact that an alien takes part in a strike in company with British subjects of the same occupation is not alone a sufficient reason for his deportation'. Shortt oversaw the deportation of the Estonian anarchist Eduard Sõrmus, the so-called 'Red Violinist', who was ultimately removed from the country on the 15th of February 1919. In a November 1919 meeting with representatives from the Board of Deputies of British Jews Shortt rejected their proposals for an appeal to a judge in chambers prior to the making of a deportation order, arguing that the necessity of tackling political subversives in the aftermath of the Great War depended on the government holding on to what he described as 'abnormal' powers. He also reprieved Ronald True, who had been condemned to death for murder, after finding the issue of his sanity in doubt. He was unpopular with some people in Parliament because of his regional partiality: tending to appoint barristers from the North East to many top posts. Shortt was in favour of denying entry to Mormon missionaries, with the Home Office believing such a policy would prove unpopular with the public. Malcolm R. Thorp has suggested that Shortt's position as Recorder of Sunderland before he entered parliament may have influenced his feelings, as Sunderland experienced anti-Mormon riots in 1912, which Shortt presumably witnessed. These experiences could have convinced him that a more generous policy towards the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would have prompted renewed violence. When Lloyd George's coalition government fell in October 1922 in the aftermath of the Carlton Club meeting, he realised his Cabinet career was effectively over and stood down from Parliament. Career after Parliament He subsequently held a number of official posts, including the chairmanship of the committees on the rating of machinery, trusts, heavy motor traffic, and the investigation into the Agricultural Marketing Act. In November 1929, Shortt was appointed as second President of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) succeeding T.P. O'Connor. This was an odd appointment as Shortt had no real interest and actively disliked sound films, and was also known to be critical of Hollywood. The Board had been set up by the film industry and had no statutory role (local councils being technically responsible for judging who could see a film) but in practice its rulings were always obeyed. In March 1930 the BBFC rejected Her Unborn Child after a viewing by Shortt. This was the first time that the BBFC had been presented with a film that depicted the act of childbirth, and the decision to reject was never reversed. At the time, educational bodies were keen to exploit the emergence of sound films in Europe with serious scientific films. After academic pressure, Shortt would soften his position later that year and the BBFC would become more open to such productions. One beneficiary was the 1927 German film Nature and Love. Shortt, however, generally followed previous policy of a highly restrictive licensing. In the Board's report for 1931, he outlined his concern about the increasing number of films dealing with sexual topics, and promised further restrictions. In 1932 he rejected the Tod Browning film Freaks, a ban that would not be lifted until 1963.Robertson, p. 52 The following year he had to contend with Island of Lost Souls by the American director Erle C. Kenton, which had already caused some controversy in the US over its alleged portrayal of cruelty to animals. Consequently, Shortt was concerned enough to view the film himself instead of one of his censors, and he imposed a ban throughout the country.Robertson, p. 57 He banned 120 films in five years and in 1932 ordered cuts to 382, a record number; one of which was Red-Headed Woman, starring Jean Harlow. He also introduced the 'H' rating (for horror), which was the origin of the later X rated film. Shortt was very upfront about the power of cinema to shape public opinion: :There is in our hands as citizens an instrument to mould the minds of the young, to mould the mind of the adolescent, and to create great and good and noble citizens for our future. There is the instrument right to our hands. If we control it, if we work public opinion up to the pitch of controlling it properly, there is a great future for our old country, and I cannot understand why with our united cooperation, we should not finally attain to that perfect ideal. In the last year of his life he founded the security firm Nightwatch Services, which would later develop into Securicor.Group 4's Danes to swoop on Securicor The Times, 1 February 2004 His company was one of the first specialist security firms to be established in the modern era, and provided guarding services. Assessment Shortt was described by John Maynard Keynes in The Economic Consequences of the Peace as 'a capable but obstinate man too much bound to preconceived opinions', though Michael Bentley wryly notes that such qualities may have been useful in his position as President of the BBFC. He was 'sociable, good-humoured and well- meaning', remembered affectionately as 'Teddie' in his native Newcastle, though very much shaped by his traditional 19th century education and experience. Liberal in politics, he was paternalistic in matters of human behaviour, art, and entertainment. Personal Shortt married Isabella Stewart Scott, who had been born in Valparaiso, Chile to British parents. They had one son, Lieutenant William Edward Dudley Shortt, who was killed on the 12th of October 1917 while serving as a junior officer with the Scots Guards at the Battle of Passchendaele. He also had three daughters, including Doreen Ingrams. His old university, Durham, conferred the honorary degree of DCL upon him in 1920. Shortt was an active freemason and was a member of University of Durham Lodge no. 3030, a London-based masonic lodge formed for alumni of Durham University. He served as Worshipful Master of the lodge in 1919 and again in 1926 and 1927. He died on 10 November 1935 at his home in London, 140 Oakwood Court in Kensington at the age of 73. His obituary in The Times described the cause of death as blood poisoning after influenza. At the time of his death he was President of Den Norske Klub.

Life and career Teller was born in Leipzig. His father, Romanus Teller (1703–1750), was a pastor at Leipzig, and afterwards became professor of theology in the University of Leipzig. He edited the earlier volumes of a (\\"Bible Book\\", 19 volumes, 1749–1770) which was designed as an adaptation for German readers of the exegetical works of Andrew Willet, Henry Ainsworth, Simon Patrick, Matthew Poole, Matthew Henry and others. Wilhelm Abraham studied philosophy and theology in the university of his native town. Amongst the men whose influence mainly determined his theological position and line of work was Johann August Ernesti. Teller's writings presented rationalism in its course of development from biblical supernaturalism to the borders of deistical naturalism. His first learned production was a Latin translation of Benjamin Kennicott's Dissertation on the State of the Printed Hebrew Text of the Old Testament (1756), which was followed the next year by an essay in which he expounded his own critical principles. In 1761 he was appointed pastor, professor of theology and general superintendent in the University of Helmstedt. Here he pursued his exegetical, theological and historical researches, the results of which appeared in his Lehrbuch des christlichen Glaubens (\\"Textbook of Christian Faith\\", 1764). This work caused some commotion, as much by the novelty of its method as by the heterodoxy of its matter, and more by its omissions than by its positive teaching, though everywhere the author sought to put theological doctrines in a decidedly modern form. In 1767 Teller, whose attitude had made his position at Helmstedt intolerable, accepted an invitation from the Prussian minister for ecclesiastical affairs to the post of provost of Cölln, with a seat in the Lutheran Supreme Consistory of Berlin. Here he found himself in the company of the rationalistic theologians of Prussia: Friedrich Samuel Gottfried Sack (1738–1817), Johann Joachim Spalding (1714–1804) and others and became one of the leaders of the rationalistic party, and one of the chief contributors to CF Nicolai's Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek. Teller was not long in making use of his freer position in Berlin. In 1772 appeared the most popular of his books, Wörterbuch des Neuen Testamentes zur Erklärung der christlichen Lehre (\\"Dictionary of the New Testament for the Explanation of Christian Doctrine\\", 6th ed., 1805). The object of this work was to recast the language and ideas of the New Testament and give them the form of 18th-century illuminism. The author maintains that the Graeco-Hebraic expressions must not be interpreted literally, but explained in terms intelligible to the modern mind. By this lexicon Teller had put himself amongst the most advanced rationalists, and his opponents charged him with the design of overthrowing positive Christianity altogether. In 1786 the author became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. The Wollner Edict of 9 July 1788, for the enforcement of Lutheran orthodoxy, and Teller's action, as member of the consistorial council, in defiance of it (cf. his Wohlgemeinte Erinnerungen, \\"Well-Meaning Reminders\\", 1788), led the Prussian government to pass upon him the sentence of suspension for three months, with forfeiture of his stipend. He was not, however, moved by such means, and (1792) issued his work Die Religion der Vollkommeneren (\\"The Religion of the More Perfect\\"), an exposition of his theological position, in which he advocated at length the idea, subsequently often urged, of the perfectibility of Christianity, that is, of the ultimate transformation of Christianity into a scheme of simple morality, with a complete rejection of all specifically Christian ideas and methods. This book represented the culminating point of German illuminism, and is separated by a long process of development from the author's . In the same year he published his Anleitung zur Religion überhaupt und zum Allgemeinen des Christenthums besonders; für die Jugend höherer und gebildeter Stünde aller Religions parteien (\\"Manual of All Religion and the Generalities of Christianity Especially; for the Youth of Upper and Educated Classes of all Religious Denominations\\"). Besides his contributions to the Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek, he edited a popular and practically useful Magazin für Prediger (\\"Magazine for Preachers\\", 1792–1801). He died in Berlin.

Settlers from Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia established the colony in the 6th century BC. The ancient city is located on the shore of the Black Sea on the outskirts of present-day Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula, where it is referred to as Khersones (). The site is part of the National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos. The name Chersonesos in Greek means \\"peninsula\\" and aptly describes the site on which the colony was established. It should not be confused with the Tauric Chersonese, a name often applied to the whole of the southern Crimea. During much of the classical period Chersonesus operated as a democracy ruled by a group of elected Archons and a council called the Demiurgoi. As time passed, the government grew more oligarchic, with power concentrated in the hands of the archons. A form of oath sworn by all the citizens from the 3rd century BC onwards has survived to the present day. In 2013 UNESCO listed Chersonesus as a World Heritage Site.

In the late 2nd century BC Chersonesus became a dependency of the Bosporan Kingdom. It was subject to Rome from the middle of the 1st century BC until the 370s AD, when it was captured by the Huns. = Byzantine era = It became a Byzantine possession during the Early Middle Ages and withstood a siege by the Göktürks in 581. Byzantine rule was slight: there was a small imperial garrison more for the town's protection than for its control. It was useful to Byzantium in two ways: it was an observation point to watch the barbarian tribes, and its isolation made it a popular place of exile for those who angered the Roman and later Byzantine governments. Among its more famous \\"inmates\\" were Pope Clement I and Pope Martin I, and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Justinian II. According to Theophanes the Confessor and others, Chersonesus was the residence of a Khazar governor (tudun) in the late 7th century. Between approximately 705 and 840, the city's affairs were managed by elected officials called babaghuq, meaning \\"father of the city\\". In 833, Emperor Theophilus sent the nobleman Petronas Kamateros, who had recently overseen the construction of the Khazar fortress of Sarkel, to take direct control over the city and its environs, establishing the theme of Klimata/Cherson. It remained in Byzantine hands until the 980s, when it reportedly fell to Kiev. Vladimir the Great agreed to evacuate the fortress only if Basil II's sister Anna Porphyrogeneta would be given him in marriage. The demand caused a scandal in Constantinople. As a pre-condition for the marriage settlement, Vladimir was baptized here in 988, thus paving the way to the Baptism of Kievan Rus'. Thereafter Korsun' was evacuated. Since this campaign is not recorded in Greek sources, historians have suggested that the account actually refers to the events of the Rus'–Byzantine War (1043) and to a different Vladimir. In fact, most valuables looted by the Slavs in Korsun' made their way to Novgorod (perhaps by way of Joachim the Korsunian, the first Novgorodian bishop, as his surname indicates ties to Korsun), where they were preserved in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom until the 20th century. One of the most interesting items from this \\"Korsun Treasure\\" is the copper Korsun Gate, supposedly captured by the Novgorodians in Korsun' and now part of the St. Sophia Cathedral. After the Fourth Crusade (1202–04), Chersonesus became dependent on the Byzantine Empire of Trebizond as the Principality of Theodoro. After the Siege of Trebizond (1461) the Principality of Theodoro became independent. The city fell under Genoese control in the early 13th century. In 1299, the town was sacked by the Mongol armies of Nogai Khan's Golden Horde. Byzantine sources last mention Chersonesus in 1396, and based on archaeological evidence the site is presumed to have been abandoned in the following decades.  Ecclesiastical history  Chersonesus had been a Roman pre-Great Schism, later Greek/Orthodox, episcopal see for centuries, elevated early to the rank of archbishopric, since it is mentioned as such in the Notitiae Episcopatuum; it disappeared after the Turkish conquest in 1475 and the destruction of the city.Raymond Janin, v. 3. Chersonnèse, in: Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques, vol. XII, Paris 1953, coll. 636–638. Saint Vladimir Cathedral in Chersonesus was built in the 19th century in the Byzantine Revival style. In the late 19th century, the grand Russian Orthodox St Vladimir's Cathedral (completed 1892) was built on a small hill overlooking the site; designed in Byzantine style, it was intended to commemorate the site of Vladimir's baptism. = Latin (now titular) see = In 1333, a Latin Church diocese of Chersonesus was established, but it appears that it had only a bishop, a Dominican called Richard the Englishman.Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 1, p. 184Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 365J.

(1960.07.22 – 1965.05.16) * Hemaiagh Guédiguian, C.A.M. (1971.03.03 – 1976.07.03), later Patriarch of Cilicia of the Armenians (Lebanon) ([1976.07.03] 1976.07.05 – retired 1982.05.30), President of Synod of the Armenian Catholic Church (1976.07.05 – 1982.05.30)  Remains  = Archaeological site = The 1935 Basilica The bell of Chersonesos The 1935 Basilica Chersonesus's ancient ruins are presently located in one of Sevastopol's suburbs. They were excavated by the Russian government, starting from 1827. They are today a popular tourist attraction, protected as an archaeological park. The buildings mix influences of Greek, Roman and Byzantine culture. The defensive wall was approximately long, 3.5 to 4 metres wide and 8 to 10 metres high with towers at a height of 10 to 12 metres. The walls enclosed an area of about . Buildings include a Roman amphitheatre and a Greek temple. The surrounding land under the control of the city, the chora, consists of several square kilometres of ancient but now barren farmland, with remains of wine presses and defensive towers. According to archaeologists, the evidence suggests that the locals were paid to do the farm work instead of being enslaved. The excavated tombstones hint at burial practices that were different from the Greek ones. Each stone marks the tomb of an individual, instead of the whole family and the decorations include only objects like sashes and weapons, instead of burial statues. Over half of the tombs archaeologists have found have bones of children. Burned remnants suggest that the city was plundered and destroyed. In 2007, Chersonesus tied for fifth in the Seven Wonders of Ukraine poll. On February 13, 2009, Ukrainian Defence Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov called on Russia's Black Sea naval fleet to move its automobile depot from the site to another place. The location of the Russian Black Sea naval fleet's automobile depot was one of the obstacles to the inclusion of the reserve on UNESCO's list of world heritage sites. In 2017, archaeologists discovered on the outskirts of Sevastopol, fragments of an ancient Greek altar with figures of gods.Ancient Greek Altar Discovered In CrimeaRussia: Ancient altar with figures of Greek gods found in Sevastopol = The 1935 basilica = The 1935 basilica is the most famous basilica excavated in Chersonesus. The original name is unknown so \\"1935\\" refers to the year it was opened. The basilica was probably built in the 6th century on the site of an earlier temple, assumed by historians to be a synagogue, itself replacing a small temple dating from the early days of Christianity. The 1935 basilica is often used as an image representing Chersonesos. Its picture appears on one Ukrainian banknote. = Museum contents = As well as the archaeological sites, the museum has around 200,000 smaller items from 5 AD to the 15th century, over 5,000 of which are currently exhibited. These include: *ancient texts, including the Oath of Chersonese citizens (3rd century BC),Syll.³ 360 - English translation decrees in honour of Diophantus (2nd century BC) IOSPE³ 3.8 - Greek text and English translation *a collection of coins *a mosaic of black and white pebbles and coloured stones *ancient ceramics *architectural fragments, including ancient and medieval abacuses, reliefs, the remains of ancient murals = Current studies = The Institute of Classical Archaeology of the University of Texas at Austin and the local Archaeological Park has investigated the site since 1992. The Ukrainian government has included the site on its tentative World Heritage List. The site, however, is in danger of further urban encroachment and coastal erosion. In 2013, \\"The Ancient City of Tauric Chersonese and its Chora\\" was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This World Heritage Site consists of seven locations that encompass the city of Chersonesus and six plots of agricultural land. The site was designated as a World Heritage site under the UNESCO criterion (ii) and (v). UNESCO considers these areas to show cultural lifestyles and land use of ancient populations that inhabited these areas. During the 2014 Crimean crisis, the Crimean peninsula was annexed by Russia, but UNESCO has maintained that it will continue to recognize Crimea and its heritage sites as belonging to Ukraine. = Problems and controversies = The encroachment of modern building in and around the ancient archaeological site, coupled with a lack of funding to prevent such development pressures, has left the site of Chersonesus firmly at risk. In an October 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, Global Heritage Fund identified Chersonesus as one of 12 worldwide sites most \\"On the Verge\\" of irreparable loss and destruction, citing insufficient management and development pressures as primary causes. On July 29, 2015 governor of Sevastopol Sergei Menyailo (Сергей Меняйло), after firing the director of Chersonesus Preserve Andrey Kulagin (Андрей Кулагин), appointed a priest, Sergiy Khalyuta (Сергий Халюта) to the position. This move caused heated protests of the staff, and the 109 members unanimously refused to work under the new director. The conflict attracted a significant attention of the media. The workers claim that the conflict of the governor and the director of the Preserve started on July 11, when director complained about road construction works within the territory of the Preserve, approved by Governor without the permits necessary for works in protected areas. Eventually, under the pressure, Father Sergiy stepped down.

For the text of the treaty with Great Britain see . Norway and Sweden were included in a single treaty signed in 1869 when the two countries were joined in a personal union under the Swedish monarchy.

For the text of the 1906 Inter-American Convention see . The treaties with each of the German states except Prussia became obsolete when the German Empire was proclaimed in 1871. The treaties with Prussia and Austria-Hungary lapsed with the American declaration of war in 1917 and were never revived. Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom terminated their treaties; and Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay withdrew from the 1906 convention.For the 1937 Treaty with Lithuania see A typical Bancroft treaty had three major provisions. The first specified the terms under which each party would recognize the naturalization of its citizens by the other. (Five years' uninterrupted residence in the adopted country was the usual requirement.) The second provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their native country could be prosecuted for crimes that they allegedly committed before they emigrated. The third and most important provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their country of origin and stayed there for two continuous years would be presumed to have resumed their former nationality. That would require them to meet any unfulfilled military service obligation in their native country and deny them the diplomatic protection of their adopted one. Article III of the 1908 treaty with Portugal was typical: Constitutional infirmity Conceived in an era when the right of individuals to change their citizenship was not universally recognized, the Bancroft treaties represented an important step forward in securing recognition by foreign governments of the right of their nationals to become American citizens.For a description of the legal doctrine of \\"perpetual allegiance\\" of subjects to their sovereign and the role of the Bancroft treaties in hastening its decline, see David A. Martin, Dual Nationality: TR’s \\"Self-Evident Absurdity\\"', Chair Lecture, October 27, 2004, University of Virginia School of Law. But American constitutional law eventually made the treaties obsolete. In Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the Supreme Court invalidated a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (the McCarran-Walter Act) that would strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship after three years' continuous residence in their country of origin; and in Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967), the Supreme Court, reviewing part of the Nationality Act of 1940, held that Congress has no power to strip anyone of their citizenship, whether it is acquired by birth or by naturalization. These decisions strongly suggested that any future case of involuntary loss of citizenship under one of the Bancroft treaties probably would not survive a Supreme Court challenge.\\"Naturalization Treaties\\". 7 FAM 1270, Appendix A (d).

First developed in the New York area at a time of violence and social instability for the colonies and Native Americans, the English and Iroquois councils and subsequent treaties were based on supporting peace and stability to preserve trade. They addressed issues of colonial settlement, and tried to suppress violence between the colonists and Indian tribes, as well as among the tribes, from New England to the Colony of Virginia. History The Covenant Chain is embodied in the Two Row Wampum of the Iroquois. It was based in agreements negotiated between Dutch settlers in New Netherland (present-day New York) and the Five Nations of the Iroquois (or Haudenosaunee) early in the 17th century. Their emphasis was on trade with the Native Americans. As the historian Bernard Bailyn has noted, all the colonies, Dutch and English, were first established to create profits. A representation of the original Two Row Wampum treaty belt. Through the Beaver Wars in the seventeenth century, the Iroquois conquered other tribes and territories for new hunting grounds and to take captives to add to their populations depleted from warfare and new European infectious diseases. The tribes in New England suffered even more depletion. The Iroquois expanded their influence, conquering or displacing other tribes from Maritime Canada west to the Mississippi Valley, and from the Canadian Shield south to the Ohio Valley.Fred Anderson, \\"America: 'Into the Heart of Darkness'\\", Review of Bernard Bailyn, The Barbarous Years: The Peopling of British North America: The Conflict of Civilizations, 1600-1675, New York Review of Books, 4 April 2013 When the English took over New Netherland in 1664 and established the Province of New York, they renewed these agreements. Conflicts erupted in New England in King Philip's War in 1675, \\"the most destructive war\\" in seventeenth-century North America, in which more than 600 colonists and 3,000 Indians died.James D. Drake, King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675–1676 (University of Massachusetts Press, 1999), p. 168 and passim Nearly at the same time was Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia. Both resulted in widespread suffering and loss among Native Americans and colonists. Because of the standing relationship with the Iroquois and the extensive influence of the Haudenosaunee, in August 1675, New York's Governor Sir Edmund Andros asked them for help in ending regional conflicts of the time in New England and the Chesapeake. He worked with the Onondaga leader Daniel Karakontie. The term \\"Covenant Chain\\" was derived from the metaphor of a silver chain holding the English sailing ship to the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Tree of Peace in the Onondaga Nation. A three- link silver chain was made to symbolize their first agreement. The links represent \\"Peace, Friendship and Respect\\" between the Haudenosaunee and the Crown. It was also the first written treaty to use such phrases as: ::...as long as the sun shines upon the earth; ::as long as the waters flow; ::as long as the grass grows green, peace will last. =Treaties within the Covenant Chain= They negotiated the signing of several treaties that expanded the number of tribes and colonies involved: * A 1676 treaty between the Mohawk nation and the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut which ended King Philip's War in New England, as the Mohawk denied Metacom gunpowder and attacked his winter camp. It also addressed relations between the Iroquois and a number of other tribes, including the Mahican of the Hudson River, and the Nipmuc, Mohegan, and Massachusett of New England. * A 1677 treaty between the Five Nations of the Iroquois and the Delaware (Lenape), on one side, and the colonies of Virginia and Maryland, allied with the Susquehannock on the other, to obtain peace. Many of the Susquehannock migrated north into western New York, re-settling with the Seneca and Onondaga of the Iroquois. The treaties marked a new era in colonial history, in which the Chesapeake had nearly eighty years of peace. New York and the Haudenosaunee became the focus of English Indian policy. In the mid-eighteenth century, Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern Department and based in central New York, had great influence and was knighted for his service. Through the early decades of the eighteenth century, New England continued to have conflicts with New France and its Abenaki allies, leading to years of raiding by both sides and ransoming of captives. In these agreements, the colonies agreed to hold negotiations generally at Albany, New York, under the auspices of the New York governor, as the covenant had first been established there. As a result, according to the historian Daniel Richter, \\"Iroquois and New Yorkers played dominant but seldom dictatorial roles\\" in the maintenance of these treaties.Richter, p. 5 At a council meeting in 1684, Virginia Governor Lord Effingham used the phrase \\"covenant chain\\" to describe these agreements. The metaphor was continued by a Seneca speaker, who said: \\"Let the Chaine be Kept Cleane and bright as Silver that the great tree that is can not break it a peeces if it should fall upon itt.\\"Richter, p. 47 Later colonial administrators assumed that these treaties granted the English sovereign control over the Iroquois and other tribes involved in the chain.Richter, p. 43 The Iroquois did not agree with this and believed themselves at least to be equals. In a Covenant Chain council that took place in 1692, the Iroquois leaders asserted: ::You say that you are our father and I am your son... ::...We will not be like Father and Son, but like Brothers. =Dissolution of the Covenant Chain= The Covenant Chain continued until 1753, when the Mohawk, claiming to have been cheated out of lands rightfully theirs in New York, declared that the chain was broken. Howard Zinn, in his \\"A People's History of the United States\\" discusses the taking of the Mohawk land: This mezzotint of William Johnson was published in London in 1756, just one year after his attempt to renew the Covenant Chain.Johnson Papers, vol. 2, v–xii, 160. See also Revealing the Light: Mezzotint Engravings at Georgetown University, from the Georgetown University Library. The Albany Congress was called to help repair the chain. Colonial delegates failed to work together to improve the diplomatic relationship with the Iroquois, a serious shortcoming on the eve of the French and Indian War. As a result, the British government took the responsibility of Native American diplomacy out of the hands of the colonies and established the British Indian Department in 1755. In a 1755 council with the Iroquois, William Johnson, Superintendent of the Northern Department based in central New York, renewed and restated the chain. He called their agreement the \\"Covenant Chain of love and friendship\\", saying that the chain has been attached to the immovable mountains and that every year the British would meet with the Iroquois to \\"strengthen and brighten\\" the chain. He developed great influence among the Iroquois and was later knighted for his contributions to development in the Northeast. Commemoration In June 2010, Queen Elizabeth II of Canada renewed the Covenant Chain Treaties by presenting 8 silver hand bells each to Band Chiefs from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory and Six Nations of the Grand River in commemoration of 300 years of the Covenant Chain. The bells were inscribed \\"The Silver Chain of Friendship 1710–2010\\" (which was a common term often used throughout history when the Chain was renewed). This marks the most modern renewal of the Covenant Chain Treaties between the Haudenosaunee and the Crown of Canada and provides a legal basis for recognition of Haudenosaunee sovereignty and international trade between the two nations.

Life BEIC) Nicolai was born in Berlin, where his father, Christoph Gottlieb Nicolai (d. 1752), was the founder of the bookseller Nicolaische Buchhandlung. He received a good education, and in 1749 went to Frankfurt (Oder) to learn his father's business, finding time also to become acquainted with English literature. In 1752 Nicolai returned to Berlin, and began to take part in literary controversy by defending John Milton against the attacks of JC Gottsched. His Briefe über den jetzigen Zustand der schönen Wissenschaften in Deutschland, published anonymously in 1755 and reprinted by G Ellinger in 1894, were directed against both Gottsched and Gottsched's Swiss opponents, Johann Jakob Bodmer and Johann Jakob Breitinger; his enthusiasm for English literature won for him the friendship of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Moses Mendelssohn. In association with Mendelssohn he established in 1757 the Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften, a periodical which he conducted until 1760. Together with Lessing and Mendelssohn, Nicolai edited the famous book review journal Briefe, die neueste Literatur betreffend between 1759 and 1765; and from 1765 to 1792 he edited another book review journal Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek. This latter periodical served as the organ of the so- called popular philosophers, who warred against authority in religion and against what they conceived to be extravagance in literature. His romances are largely forgotten, although Das Leben und die Meinungen des Herrn Magister Sebaldus Nothanker (1773–1776), and his satire on Goethe's Werther, Freuden des jungen Werthers (1775), had a certain reputation in their day. Between 1788 and 1796, Nicolai published in twelve volumes a Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die Schweiz, which bears witness to the conservatism of his views in later life. Nicolai also offered an early account of visual hallucinosis with preservation of insight and unrelated to madness:Berrios GE & Marková IS (2015) Visual hallucinations: history and context of current research. In Collerton D, Mosimann UP and Perry E (eds.) The Neuroscience of Visual Hallucinations. London: John Wiley & Sons, pp3-22. “suddenly I observed, at the distance of ten paces, the figure of a deceased person. I asked my wife whether she saw it.

He died two years after the accession of James VI and I. Rushton Triangular Lodge. Life Tresham was brought up in the Throckmorton household. He inherited large estates in 1559 from his grandfather and namesake Thomas Tresham I, establishing him as a member of the Catholic elite. He was widely regarded as clever and well- educated, a correspondent of William Cecil, the Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth, and Sir Christopher Hatton, the Lord Chancellor. Well-read, Tresham dedicated much of his life to collecting books. He was picked as sheriff for Northamptonshire in 1573 and was knighted at the Queen's Royal Progress at Kenilworth in 1575. He frequently entertained large numbers of friends and acquaintances and pursued a successful reforming estate policy. His recusancy, Jesuit connections and arguments for the state's lack of jurisdiction in matters of conscience made him the subject of official attention, and he was imprisoned several times and fined heavily. At a time when Queen Elizabeth was anxious about the Catholic threat posed by Spain and by her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholics were made targets for persecution by their spiritual loyalty to another temporal power (the Pope, and consequently, in the view of Protestants, the Catholic King of Spain). Between 1581 and 1605, Tresham paid penalties totalling just under £8,000. (equivalent to £ in ). These heavy financial demands were, in reality, overshadowed by the expense of his building projects and his insistence on making advantageous marriages for his six daughters, bringing with them sizeable dowries (£12,200). His credit was thus impaired, and the ill-advised involvement of his son, Francis, in the Earl of Essex's rebellion, cost him over £3,000. As a Catholic known for his connection to the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and who argued for an individual's right to act according to his conscience unmolested, he was tarred with the brush of disloyalty, a mark he fiercely rejected. Ultimately, his son Lewis successfully ate through what little family money was left. He left three notable buildings in Northamptonshire, the extraordinary Rushton Triangular Lodge and the unfinished Lyveden New Bield, both of which embody the strength of his faith. The Triangular Lodge bears witness to Tresham's fidelity to the doctrine of the Trinity. There was also a more personal connection: above the door we find the inscription 'Tres testimonium dant' ('the three bear witness', or, perhaps, 'Tres bears witness'). 'Tres' may be a moment of self- reference; it was his wife's pet name for him. Tresham himself was the architect of these designs, and the extant family papers in the British Library reveal some of his plans. His sense of civic responsibility in local society, occasioned by his gentility and the expectations of his rank and family practice, led him to begin building the Market House at Rothwell in 1577, thought to be a sessions house and decorated with the arms of other local families. Sir Thomas was a considerable landowner at his death in 1605, but his estate had £11,000 of debt (equivalent to £ in ). Marriage and children In 1566, he married Muriel, a daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton and Elizabeth Hussey. The Throckmorton family was a wealthy Catholic family from Coughton Court in Warwickshire and Tresham had been Sir Robert's ward. Muriel Tresham once wrote to the Countess of Bedford for her help, as a \\"lowly wife on my knees with importunacy.\\"Gary Schneider, The Culture of Epistolarity (Newark, 2005), p. 117. Thomas and Muriel had eleven children, including; *Francis (d. December 1605) *Mary (d. 13 October 1664); married Thomas Brudenell, 1st Earl of Cardigan *Elizabeth; married William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle *Frances; married Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton *Catherine; married Sir John Webbe, 2nd Baron of Odstock His elder son, Francis, inherited the titles, estate, and debt, and became embroiled in the Gunpowder Plot later that year along with his cousins Robert Catesby and Thomas Wintour. Imprisoned for his actions, Francis met an early death from natural causes in December 1605, avoiding certain execution. Nevertheless, he was decapitated after his death and his head displayed as that of a notorious traitor. His role in the Plot has been the subject of debate by historians and it has been largely accepted that he was the author of the famous 'Mounteagle Letter'. However widely agreed his authorship of the letter to his relative, it remains conjectural.

Life to 1662 He was born at York, the son of Francis Pole, but he spelled his name Poole, and in Latin Polus; his mother was a daughter of Alderman Toppins there. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from 1645, under John Worthington. Having graduated B.A. at the beginning of 1649, he succeeded Anthony Tuckney, in the sequestered rectory of St Michael le Querne, then in the fifth classis of the London province, under the parliamentary system of presbyterianism. This was his only preferment. He proceeded M.A. in 1652. On 14 July 1657 he was one of eleven Cambridge graduates incorporated M.A. at Oxford on occasion of the visit of Richard Cromwell as chancellor. Poole was a jure divino presbyterian, and an authorised defender of the views on ordination of the London provincial assembly, as formulated by William Blackmore. After the Restoration of the English monarchy, in a sermon of 26 August 1660 before the lord mayor Sir Thomas Aleyn at St Paul's Cathedral, he made a case for simplicity in public worship. On the passing of the Uniformity Act 1662 he resigned his living, and was succeeded by R. Booker on 29 August 1662. Later life Though he occasionally preached and printed some tracts, Poole made no attempt to gather a congregation. He had a patrimony of £100 a year, on which he lived. He was one of those who presented to the king ‘a cautious and moderate thanksgiving’ for the indulgence of 15 March 1672, and were offered royal bounty. Gilbert Burnet reports, on Edward Stillingfleet's authority, that Poole received for two years a pension of £50. Early in 1675 he entered with Richard Baxter into a negotiation for comprehension, promoted by John Tillotson, which came to nothing. According to Henry Sampson, Poole made provision for a nonconformist ministry and day-school at Tunbridge Wells, Kent. In his depositions relative to the alleged Popish plot (September 1678), Titus Oates had represented Poole as marked for assassination, because of his tract (1666) on the Nullity of the Romish Faith. Poole gave some credit to this, reportedly after a scare on returning home one evening near Clerkenwell with Josiah Chorley. Poole left England, and settled at Amsterdam. Here he died on 12 October 1679 (N.S.), and was buried in a vault of the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam. His wife was buried on 11 August 1668 at St Andrew Holborn, Stillingfleet preaching the funeral sermon. He left a son, who died in 1697. Works In 1654 Poole published a tract against John Biddle. In 1658 he put forward a scheme for a scholarship for university courses, for those intending to enter the ministry. The plan was approved by Worthington and Tuckney, and had the support also of John Arrowsmith, Ralph Cudworth, William Dillingham, and Benjamin Whichcote. Money was raised, and supported William Sherlock at Peterhouse. His Vox Clamantis gives his view of the ecclesiastical situation after 1662. The work with which his name is principally associated is the Synopsis criticorum biblicorum (5 vols fol., 1669-1676), in which he summarizes the views of one hundred and fifty biblical critics. On the suggestion of William Lloyd, Poole undertook the Synopsis as a digest of biblical commentators, from 1666. It took ten years, with relaxation often at Henry Ashurst's house. The prospectus of Poole's work mustered of eight bishops and five continental scholars. A patent for the work was obtained on 14 October 1667, and the first volume was ready for the press, when difficulties were raised by Cornelius Bee, publisher of the Critici Sacri (1660); the matter was decided in Poole's favour. Rabbinical sources and Roman Catholic commentators are included; little is taken from John Calvin, nothing from Martin Luther. The book was written in Latin and is currently being translated into English by the Matthew Poole Project. Poole also wrote English Annotations on the Holy Bible, completing the chapters as far as Isaiah 58 before his death in 1679. The rest of the Annotations were completed by friends and colleagues among his Nonconformist brethren.New International Encyclopedia The first printing of the completed edition was in 1685 [1683?], 2 volumes folio, followed by editions in 1688, 1696 (with valuable chapter outlines added by the editors, Samuel Clark and Edward Veale), and the 4th and definitive edition in 1700, the basis of all others.

It comprises a total area of and a length of about , of which are natural borders by bodies of water and the Argentine and Brazilian sides together comprise around . Iguaçu National Park was created by federal decree nr. 1035 of January 10, 1939, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. The park is managed by Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The park shares with Iguazú National Park in Argentina one of the world's largest waterfalls, extending over some . It is home to many rare and endangered species of flora and fauna, among them the giant otter and the giant anteater. The clouds of spray produced by the waterfall are conducive to the growth of lush vegetation. History Iguaçu National Park Gateway The Iguaçu National Park owes its name to the fact it includes an important area of the Iguazu River (Portuguese: Rio Iguaçu). Approximately of the length of the river makes up the Iguaçu Falls. It is the most important park of the Prata Basin and, since it is a haven to a significant genetic asset of animal and vegetal species, it was the first park in Brazil to receive a Management Plan. As foreseen by Rebouças, the park's basic goal is the preservation of the highly relevant ecologically and scenic natural ecosystems, thus enabling scientific research and the development of environmental education and interpretation activities, recreation in natural surroundings and the ecological tourism. The Iguaçu National Park is spectacular as well as pioneering. The first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to \\"future generations\\", just as \\"it had been created by God\\" and endowed with \\"all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome\\" and \\"an unmatched flora\\" located in the \\"magnificent Iguaçu waterfalls\\". These were the words used by André Rebouças, an engineer, in his book \\"Provinces of Paraná, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia\\", which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Iguaçu Falls way back in 1876, when Yellowstone National Park, the first national park on the planet, was four years old. On November 17, 1986, during the UNESCO conference held in Paris, the Iguaçu National Park was listed as Natural Heritage of Humanity and is one of the largest forest preservation areas in South America. Location Ticket Office In Brazil the Park has boundaries with the following municipalities: Foz do Iguaçu, Medianeira, Matelândia, Céu Azul, São Miguel do Iguaçu, Santa Terezinha de Itaipu, Santa Tereza do Oeste, Capitão Leônidas Marque, Capanema and Serranópolis. The Park is located in the westernmost region of the state of Paraná, in the Iguaçú river basin, from downtown Foz do Iguaçú. It borders Argentina, where the Iguazu National Park, which was implemented in 1934, is located. The border between the two countries and their national parks is made by the Iguaçú river, whose source is near the Serra (mountain range) do Mar near Curitiba and runs for throughout the state of Paraná. The river estuary is located 18 km downriver from the Falls, where it flows into the Paraná river. This meeting of rivers forms the triple Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay border. Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paraná River basin. They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Aguapeí State Park, Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiuá Ecological Station and Iguaçu National Park. The Santa Maria Ecological Corridor connects the Iguaçu National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu, and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park. The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion. Tourism A South American cougar caught on camera The area of the park open for visitation and where the concession areas of Cataratas do Iguaçú S/A are located, accounts for approximately 0.3% of the total area of the park. The most spectacular sightseeing of the park is the Iguaçú Falls, which form a 2,700m wide semicircle, while the water falls from a height of . The number of waterfalls ranges from 150 and 300 depending on the Iguaçú river flow. Besides the exuberant waterfalls, there are other attractions such as rich fauna, the Poço Preto (the Black Well), the Macuco Waterfall, the Visitors Center, the Santos Dumont Statue, a homage paid by VASP (a defunct airline company) to the \\"Father of Aviation\\", who lent all his prestige and efforts in turning the falls area into a National Park.

It is the fourth game in the Mana series, following 1995's Trials of Mana. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero as they restore the land of Fa'Diel by creating the world around them and completing a number of interrelated quests in order to restore the Tree of Mana. While incorporating action role-playing elements from the prior games in the series, such as real-time battles, Legend of Mana has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the world's structure through the Land Make system, generating regions and quests in a non-linear gameplay system rather than a strong main plotline. Legend of Mana was directed by series creator Koichi Ishii, designed by Akihiko Matsui, and produced by veteran Square director and producer Akitoshi Kawazu. The game had high sales, selling 400,000 copies in its first week of release and 700,000 by the end of 1999. Reviews were less positive than for prior games in the series. Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed. The game was re- released as a part of both the PlayStation's and Square Enix's best-sellers lines. It was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan and North America. Gameplay health and special move meter is shown in the gauges at the top, and the enemy's health is shown in the bar at the bottom. Like previous games in the Mana series, Legend of Mana displays an angled top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the unnamed main character, and is assisted by up to two companions. One of these companions is an optional support character, which depends on what quest the player is performing, while another companion can be chosen by the player out of a roster of monsters, pets, and golems. Both companions are typically controlled by the game's AI, though a second player can take control of the support character, or load in their own character from a different save file, if present. The main character and companions each have their own set of numerical attributes including hit points and strength, which represent the amount of damage the player can take or cause. These stats grow whenever the player advances a level, after gaining enough experience points from battle with enemies. Battles occur when the player character encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters that can be used when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller. Legend of Mana, unlike most action role-playing games, does not feature a set journey through a fixed world. Instead, it features a unique \\"Land Make\\" system where the player generates the structure of the game world by placing objects, named Artifacts, on empty square plots on a map. This map takes the form of a grid of spaces presented in an isometric viewpoint on a map screen. When an Artifact is placed in a space on the map, it creates a Land, and the player can enter that Land by selecting the position on the map. Adjacent Lands are not connected; to move from one land to another the player must first return to the map screen. Different Lands are generated from different Artifacts, each containing a quest which upon completion usually gives the player another Artifact to place. Lands can also contain additional quests. Each Land is ranked from 0 (no presence) to 3 (strong presence) in its strength in each Spirit of Mana; this in turn causes magic of that element to be stronger in that Land. The strength of the rankings is dependent on the Artifact, its position on the Map, and the rankings of adjacent Lands. Many locations have non-player characters who give quests and information or sell equipment. Other areas feature enemies and bosses with which the player can battle. In addition to the main game, after certain quests are completed Legend of Mana gives the player the option to delve into optional gameplay aspects centered around the hero or heroine's house. The player can forge or improve weapons and armor using raw materials found throughout the game, or combine equipment with items to change their power or add special effects. They can grow different types of fruit in the orchard, raise pets to use as adventuring companions, create items, and build golems. Pets can also be raised with the Japan-only PocketStation peripheral, and two players can battle each other in an arena. Plot The world map as presented in the Land Make system. Eight locations are shown; the rankings for each Spirit of Mana for the selected artifact are shown below the map. =Setting= Legend of Mana is set in the fictional world of Fa'Diel. The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned down almost entirely nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the burnt Mana Tree slept as it regrew and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, controlled by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins. The player controls the protagonist of the game, who is either a male or female silent protagonist. The character is unnamed and no information is given about their past; their history and personality is meant to be determined by the player. =Characters and story branches= Rather than a single, overarching plot, the story of Legend of Mana is composed of a multitude of quests split into three main quest arcs, numerous other quests, and a final quest arc. Each main quest arc contains optional side-quests in addition to the main quests. Whenever the player completes the required portions of one of the quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc and finish the game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed. The three main quest arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc. The first main arc is the story of the Jumi, a dying race of people who have external jewel hearts which are considered valuable. The Jumi have long been a persecuted people, and many magic characters in this game refer to them as \\"dirt\\" as a pejorative on their jewel cores. This branch focuses on Elazul and Pearl, who are among the few survivors of the Jumi. Elazul is a Jumi Knight, and the mission of his life is to protect the Jumi Guardian Pearl at any cost, even in the face of the jewel hunter, Sandra. The player assists them in helping the Jumi. The second arc is the story of Larc and Sierra—brother and sister dragoons who serve different dragon masters and fight on opposite sides of the same war for power. Larc serves the dragon Drakonis, who wants to kill the other three dragons so that he can rule the world. Larc blackmails the game's protagonist to help him in this quest. Sierra, a dragoon for Vadise the White Dragon, wants to stop Drakonis without hurting her brother Larc. In the end, Drakonis is defeated again and banished to the underworld, and Larc is killed. The third arc is the complicated love story of four childhood friends: Matilda, Irwin, Daena and Escad. Irwin is a half-demon who is angry that society prevents him from a relationship with the holy leader Matilda, and seeks to destroy the world in retribution. Escad seeks to destroy Irwin, and Daena tries to act as a mediator between all parties while keeping Matilda away from Irwin. The conflict eventually escalates into a war between humans and faeries. Depending on the choices of the player, either Daena or Escad will die, while the player helps bring an end to the conflict. Regardless of which path(s) the hero decides to take, they begin the game's final story, titled \\"Legend of Mana\\". This arc concerns the re-appearance of the Mana Tree. The player journeys to the Mana Tree and scales it, but upon reaching the top they find that the Mana Goddess has become corrupted and the tree is rotten. The player is forced to fight the Mana Goddess, and after winning a Sproutling plants itself in the Mana Tree's rotten trunk. Calling upon the other Sproutlings to join them, they restore the Mana Tree. Development and release Producer Akitoshi Kawazu Legend of Mana was directed by Mana series creator Koichi Ishii, who had worked on the three previous games in the series. Many of the other developers were new to the series, including producer Akitoshi Kawazu, the director and producer of many games in Square's SaGa series, and designer Akihiko Matsui, who had been the director for Chrono Trigger. The game's character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka, who was also new to the series. Retro Gamer, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game. Legend of Mana was designed as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation's 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project began to get out of control and out of time Kawazu tightened down the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square executives to delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Kawazu has said that this experience taught him that his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer. Legend of Mana was first announced by Square in March 1999 just before its debut at the Tokyo Game Show. The game was released in Japan in July 1999 with considerable hype, packaged with demos of Square's future releases Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross, Front Mission 3, and Threads of Fate. It was planned to be released in North America alongside the July and August 2000 releases of Chrono Cross and Threads of Fate, but was instead released early on June 6. =Music= Composer Yoko Shimomura The original score for Legend of Mana was composed, arranged, and produced by Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was a newcomer to the series; the previous two Mana games were scored by Hiroki Kikuta, and the first by Kenji Ito. Shimomura said in 2002 that she considered the soundtrack to Legend of Mana to be the one that best expresses herself. She claims that she prefers \\"passionate music that comes from the heart\\", and that she has to \\"feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I am able to write\\" the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in. Legend of Mana featured the first vocal track of any Mana game, \\"Song of Mana\\", which also serves as the game's opening theme. It was sung by Swedish vocalist Annika Ljungberg, who was chosen by Shimomura because she \\"wanted to stay away from working with someone popular that everyone already knows\\". After hearing a sample of Ljungberg's music, she flew to Sweden \\"straight away\\" to do an analog recording of the song. The 1999 soundtrack album Seiken Densetsu / Legend of Mana Original Soundtrack collects 55 tracks of music from Legend of Mana on two discs. The music covers many styles including piano, hard rock, and electronic music. The soundtrack was published by DigiCube, and was reprinted by Square Enix in 2004. The album reached #65 on the Japanese Oricon music charts and stayed on the charts for two weeks. \\"Song of Mana\\" was later made available on the Square Vocal Collection album in 2001. Four of the game's tracks were released as part of Drammatica: The Very Best Works of Yoko Shimomura, an album of arrangements highlighting the composer's work. =Merchandise= Upon the game's Japanese release, several promotional items were made available from Square, including stuffed toy dolls of the rabite enemy and mascot of the series, a necklace, and lighters. As a promotion for Square's \\"Summer of Adventure\\" release schedule in 2000, which the North American release of the game was a part of, those who preordered the game were given a free music CD with select tracks from the game. Legend of Mana was re- released in Japan late in 2000 as part of the Square Millennium Collection at a budget price along with a special music box and two character figurines. A companion book titled Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana Ultimania including artwork and interviews was released as part of Square's Ultimania series. It was published by DigiCube in 1999 and later reprinted by Square Enix in 2004 after the subsidiary's closing. An artbook, Legend of Mana: Making of Mana, was published in 2000 by ASCII. A five-volume manga series, created by Shiro Amano, was published between 2000 and 2002. Reception In Japan, Legend of Mana was a bestseller at the time of release, and sold over 400,000 units in its first week alone as the highest-selling release that week in Japan. By the end of the year, it had sold over 700,000 copies in Japan. Legend of Mana was also the top selling PlayStation game during the week of its release in North America. Legend of Mana received mixed reviews from critics. The game's presentation was almost universally praised, especially its use of vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics. David Smith of IGN claimed that the graphics were one of the game's best points, and RPGamer's Andrew P. Bilyk noted that the visuals \\"may be the most impressive two-dimensional graphics ever to grace an RPG\\". Andrew Pfister of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised them even more, calling them \\"the most impressive 2D artwork ever seen on a console\\". Damian Thomas's RPGFan review likened the graphics to Disney animation for having \\"a very storybook, cutesy cartoony feel to them\\", while Andrew Vestal of GameSpot said that the graphics were some of the most lush and ornate 2D graphics ever made. The game won an award for best graphics at the 4th Japan Game Awards from the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association. The music in Legend of Mana was also a high point in many reviews; the reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"fantastic\\" and \\"wonderful\\". Smith of IGN's review stated that the soundtrack is \\"as good as any you'll hear today\\" with a good mix of intensity, suspense, and subtle nuance, and Vestal of GameSpot termed it \\"excellently orchestrated\\" and a perfect fit for the game in each environment. Much of the game's criticism stemmed from its substitution of mostly unrelated quests over a main storyline. GamePro, while praising the Land Make system, found that the \\"focus of Legend of Mana is obscured by the over-abundance of subplots\\". Similarly, Game Revolution's Johnny Liu commented that the game lacked depth and felt like a collection of short quests rather than a single game, while Vestal of GameSpot noted that the game's use of miniquests will likely disappoint those seeking an action-RPG classic, and said that, although fun, the gameplay had a \\"schizophrenic and disjointed nature\\". Next Generation agreed, saying that the Land Make system was an \\"innovative feature\\" but that it left the game disjointed without a solid plot to keep everything together. The Japanese Weekly Famitsu reviewers felt that the system was ambitious, but left the game feeling disconnected, and that the divided plotlines kept the beginning of the game from having the charm of the end. Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine said that the lack of a plotline gave the player no incentive to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt that it was not a complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences. =Legacy= In November 2000, Legend of Mana was ranked number 48 on Weekly Famitsus list of top 100 PlayStation games of all time. The game was re-released on February 21, 2002 as part of the PSone Books best-sellers series in Japan, in 2006 as part of Square Enix's Ultimate Hits collection, and re-released on the PlayStation 3 PlayStation Network store as part of the PSone Classics series on March 22, 2011.

Biography =Early life= Carroll Cole was born in Sioux City, Iowa, the second son of LaVerne and Vesta Cole. His younger sister was born in 1939 and soon afterwards, his family moved to California, where LaVerne found work in a shipyard. Not long after that, LaVerne went to fight in World War II. While his father was away, his mother had several affairs and sometimes took Cole along to her rendezvous, threatening to beat him if he told his father. Vesta was emotionally abusive to Cole and dressed him as a girl. At school, he was teased about his \\"girl's name\\" by his peers. At age 8, he retaliated against one of his classmates, a boy of the same age named Duane, by drowning him in a lake in Richmond, California. The death was regarded an accident by authorities, until Cole confessed to it many years later in an autobiography he wrote in prison. During a press interview Cole said of this event, \\"I was primed, I had made the mental commitment I was going to get even with my mother, and things just built up and built up and became an obsession.\\" As a teen, Cole committed several petty crimes and was frequently arrested for drunkenness and minor thefts. After high school, he joined the U.S. Army but was released under a bad-conduct discharge in 1958 for stealing pistols. In 1960, Cole attacked two couples parked in cars on a lover's lane. Soon afterwards, he called the police in Richmond, California, where he was living, and told them that he was plagued by violent fantasies involving strangling women. Cole spent time in various mental hospitals over the next three years. At the last of them, Stockton State Hospital, a Dr. Weiss wrote: \\"He seems to be afraid of the female figure and cannot have intercourse with her first but must kill her before he can do it.\\" Weiss approved his release in April 1963, despite hospital staff having diagnosed Cole with antisocial personality disorder. Upon his release, Cole moved to Dallas, Texas, where his brother Richard was living. There, he met and married an alcoholic stripper named Billie Whitworth, though this didn't change his perspective towards women. After two years, the marriage ended when Cole burned down a motel after convincing himself that Whitworth was having sex with men there. As a result, he was arrested for arson. Upon his release from prison, Cole attempted to strangle an 11-year-old girl in Missouri. He was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison. After the sentence was up, Cole ended up in Nevada, where he attempted to strangle two more women. Once again, he checked himself into a mental hospital. The doctors there noted his murderous fantasies but still elected not to detain him and he was given a ticket back to San Diego. =Murders= Cole's first victim as an adult was Essie L. Buck, whom he'd picked up in a San Diego tavern on May 7, 1971. He strangled her to death in his car and drove around with her body in the trunk before eventually dumping it. Just two weeks later, he killed an unidentified woman and buried her in a wooded area. He later claimed that they had proven themselves unfaithful to their husbands, and so reminded him of his adulterous mother. In July 1973, Cole married barmaid Diana Faye Younglove Pashal, who was also an alcoholic. They argued and fought frequently, and Cole regularly went off on his own for days at a time. He would commit murders while he was away, including one woman he allegedly cannibalized to a degree. In September 1979, Cole strangled Pashal to death. A suspicious neighbor called the police eight days later, but although they found Pashal's body wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a closet, they decided that she had died because of her heavy drinking, and Cole was released without charge after questioning. Cole left San Diego and started moving around again. In 1979, Cole met Marie Cushman at a bar in Las Vegas. That same evening, the two went to a motel where they had sex, he then killed her by strangulation. Following the Las Vegas killing, he returned to Dallas, where he fatally strangled three more women in November 1980. Cole was a suspect in the second of these killings and was also found on the scene of the third murder. He was arrested and held in custody. The police then came to the conclusion that the victim had probably died of natural causes, and Cole was about to be ruled out as a suspect before he confessed to, along with this murder, all of the other killings. Cole claimed that he had murdered at least fourteen women over the previous nine years, although he added that there may have been more and he couldn't remember exactly, as he was usually drunk when he committed his crimes. =Conviction and death= On April 9, 1981, Cole was convicted of three of the murders committed in Texas. He was sentenced to life at the Huntsville Prison. In 1984, Cole's mother died and his attitude was reported to have changed. He agreed to face further murder charges filed in Nevada, even though it could possibly mean the death penalty. In February 1984, Cole was extradited to Nevada, where he was tried and convicted for the strangulation deaths of two women in 1977 and 1979. In October 1984, Cole was sentenced to death in Nevada. When his sentencing was passed he said, \\"Thanks, Judge.\\" Anti-death penalty campaigners, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) tried to have his sentence commuted, but Cole protested. Cole was executed by lethal injection at Nevada State Prison on December 6, 1985.

They are sentient computer programs disguised as human government agents, displaying a high- level of artificial intelligence.\\"The Matrix Trilogy\\". SparkNotes. Retrieved 3 December 2014. Agents are representatives within the Matrix fictional universe. They are guardians within the computer-generated world of the Matrix, protecting it from anyone or anything (most often Redpills) that could reveal it as a false reality or threaten it in any other way. Agents also hunt down and terminate any rogue programs, such as The Keymaker, which no longer serve a purpose to the overall Machine objective.\\"The Matrix\\". Common Sense Media. Retrieved 3 December 2014. They physically appear human but have a tendency to speak and act in highly precise and mechanical ways. Physical aspects Agents wear black-green business suits lined with a gold fabric, white dress shirts, black dress shoes, dark green neckties with a silver bar clip, square sunglasses, and a communication earpiece. These features are copied from the attire for plainclothes agents of the United States Secret Service, as well as those of the Men in Black conspiracy or the stereotypical G-Man/FBI official. All Agents are Caucasian males (with minor exceptions of black Agent Perry and female Agent Pace from The Matrix Online game), which also provides a dynamic compared to the majority population of Zion, containing many diverse cultures and walks of life. With the exception of Agent Pace, Agents also tend to have common Anglo-Saxon names such as Smith, Jones, Brown, etc. They have sideburns, and their hair is either slicked back or side-parted. Matrix Agents carry Desert Eagle handguns in shoulder holsters that are concealed beneath their suit jackets. In addition to proficiency in the use of firearms, all Agents are masters of the martial arts and hand-to- hand combat. Agents are programmed with a number of superhuman abilities. An Agent's speed, agility, stamina and reflexes enable them to leap great distances such as across building rooftops, sway their body from side to side to evade gunfire, and perform unusual counter attacks in melee combat (Agent Smith managed to directly counter a punch from Morpheus with a punch of his own to Morpheus's still-moving fist). Agents possess superhuman strength, performing feats such as tearing open a car's roof with one hand and punching through solid concrete. Although they can be momentarily stunned by certain attacks (such as when Neo jabbed his fingers into Agent Smith's throat), they are generally impervious to pain and injury (the upgraded Agent that Trinity shot in the abdomen and shoulder showed no reaction to pain). In spite of their abilities, they can be caught off guard with a point-blank contact shot aimed directly at their head or a barrage of firepower from a weapon with a very high rate of fire, such as that from a minigun. Any trauma that is instantly lethal to a vital organ will kill an Agent. However, being \\"killed\\" is a temporary inconvenience, as Agents do not exist in their own bodies as other programs do. Rather, they take over the virtualized body of a Bluepill—a human directly connected to the Matrix—which transforms into the Agent's form until the Agent leaves the body. An Agent can jump from one body to another, either to re-emerge in the Matrix if they \\"die\\" (which only kills the host body) or to hunt their quarry by taking over a nearby Bluepill. For this reason, areas with a high population density (crowded apartment buildings, marketplaces, freeways, etc.) are usually avoided by the Zion rebels, who regard every Bluepill as a potential threat that could become an Agent at any time. Matrix Agents can also disguise themselves as the host body (when Agent Smith possessed the body of a Matrix SWAT soldier and used it as a disguise to locate Morpheus and his crew hiding in the walls of the bathroom). Beyond their conventional abilities, Agents possess some level of influence over the Matrix to rewrite aspects of itself. In the first film, Agent Smith was able to plant a suggestion that Neo's mouth has sealed shut which made his mouth disappear on his residual self-image (RSI), and later, the Agents changed the Matrix to trap the rebels inside a hotel by surrounding it with brick walls. It is not explained how this ability works but is most likely based on a line of communication to the Source, rather than an Agent possessing inherent access to manipulate the Matrix's source code. In addition to their abilities, Agents possess an unspecified level of authority to command civilian law enforcement as both security and first-line enforcers: in particular, they have a heavily-armed SWAT team that serves as their building security. The Agents have branded the Zion infiltrators as terrorists, and the unassuming law enforcement officers will arrest or kill any rebels on the word of the Agents. With the exception of Smith, who seems intellectually superior to his colleagues (and far more ambitious), Agents show little or no emotion. Interaction with Zion infiltrators and other programs In any direct confrontation, an Agent's abilities ensure they would prevail against a normal human opponent that would eventually exhaust their own firepower, stamina, and capacity to sustain pain and injury. All Zion hovercraft crew members know that Agents are extremely dangerous and virtually impossible to eliminate; as such, they are cautioned to escape upon encountering one. According to Morpheus, in the time before Neo was freed from the Matrix, every human that had stood their ground against an Agent was killed. Morpheus and Neo both individually fought Agent Smith in the first movie, and both were defeated, only surviving because Smith needed Morpheus for questioning and Neo due to his self-realization of himself as the One. Later, once Neo had harnessed his abilities as the One, Agents no longer posed a threat to him and he could easily disintegrate Smith, scaring Agents Brown and Jones into fleeing. It is implied in the game Enter the Matrix that one of the main reasons for Neo's ability to defeat Agents was his ability to focus enough to move quickly for far longer periods than could normal rebels. This is the main cause of the player's difficulty in fighting Agents, since when the player is outside bullet time the Agents are able to dodge and counter all hand-to-hand attacks. Morpheus had been fortunate enough to survive encounters with two Agents (Smith and Johnson) throughout the trilogy. He was defeated soundly by Smith (who beat him to a bloody pulp but left him alive because he needed information from the high-ranking infiltrator), and only overcame Johnson due to the nature of their situation; he did not wear down his opponent, but merely threw him from the top of the speeding truck on which they were fighting, although he only managed to turn the tables on his foe after he was thrown off, due to the unexpected arrival of Niobe, who rescued him. Niobe has defeated an Agent, but as with Morpheus, there were extenuating circumstances. The fight took place on board a cargo plane in the skies above the Megacity; Niobe lowered the rear cargo ramp and managed to knock Agent Johnson out of the plane. Ghost has also defeated a single Agent during a raid on a nuclear power plant, again by making use of unique circumstances of the encounter. Agent Johnson challenged him in the control room of the plant, whereupon he damaged one of the high-voltage servers with small arms fire and threw his opponent into it, electrocuting him. The Oracle's bodyguard Seraph says to Smith in The Matrix Revolutions: \\"I have beaten you before,\\" but this is not expanded upon. Smith remarks that chasing Seraph is like \\"chasing a ghost,\\" suggesting a lasting rivalry between the two programs. Trinity is the only other character to have \\"stood up\\" against an Agent and survive, given that she dispatched Agent Jones by a contact shot when he was near to killing Neo, getting in close while the Agent's attention was focused on Neo. If, as Morpheus suggests, no other human had survived an Agent encounter, this would mark the first time that an Agent had been \\"defeated\\", albeit the Agent's program then \\"body hopped\\" into another Bluepill and was fighting again within minutes. Notable film agents =Agents Jones and Brown= In the first film, Agents Jones (Robert Taylor) and Brown (Paul Goddard) are credited as Agent Smith's \\"sidekicks\\". Smith is given at least one order (or at least a forceful suggestion) by Jones (\\"order the strike\\"), and there appears to be some resentment or disagreement between the three on several occasions. Jones and Brown undergo little character development and do not appear in the sequels, though they are occasionally seen in The Matrix Online. They are mostly silent, but brutal accomplices to Smith, who perform secondary tasks such as holding Neo in place when Smith places a tracking device (possibly a program) inside his body cavity. Brown chases Trinity across the rooftops in the opening sequence, missing several shots. Brown is also present in the scene wherein Morpheus is interrogated, injecting a truth serum into Morpheus's neck. Finally, Brown is ordered by Smith to check Neo for life signs after Smith shoots him and confirms Neo's death. Brown shows subtle hints of cynically deriding his \\"superior\\" Smith, such as when he seems slightly annoyed at him when they are interrogating Morpheus. Jones is less prominent than Brown in the first movie, but his most notable scene is a confrontation with Neo in a rooftop fight. He then stands above the stricken Neo, uttering the line \\"[o]nly human,\\" before being shot by Trinity, who managed to get in close enough to shoot him in the head at point-blank range while he was occupied with Neo. From this, it can be deduced Jones perceives the human race much as Smith does, though with less unbridled revulsion. Likely as a precaution, Jones is briefly seen in the background holding Brown back when Neo is about to destroy Smith at the end of the film, and they are last seen fleeing from Neo. Jones seems slightly more jaded and bored with his tasks than the other Agents. =Upgraded Agents= The Matrix Reloaded introduced \\"Upgraded\\" Agents, Jackson, Johnson, and Thompson. Their enhanced strength, speed and stamina enable them to engage in protracted combat with Neo. In The Matrix: Path of Neo, the upgraded Agents recover from violent physical injuries in a relatively short time. However, an unarmed Neo is still able to defeat them easily. The upgraded Agents continue the use of very plain, common, Anglo-Saxon names. A difference is that now their names are all two syllables and end in \\"-son\\", while the original Agents had names consisting of only a short syllable. Agent Johnson appears to be the leader of the upgrades, filling the same role as Smith prior to his first \\"death\\". Johnson attempts to destroy the exiled Keymaker program and fights Morpheus on top of a speeding truck. = Rogue Agents = When Smith was destroyed by Neo at the end of The Matrix, his programming instructed him to return to the Source (the Machine mainframe), either to be destroyed or stored. As a result of Neo's attack, something changed in Smith that allowed him to defy his programming. The change in Smith also disconnects him from the system, setting him \\"free\\" from his duties. In effect, this change makes Smith an \\"Exile\\" program without purpose. By copying his programming onto others, especially The Oracle, Smith develops similar qualities as the One, such as the ability to withstand dramatic damage and the power of flight. Because Smith feels that he is still a victim to \\"purpose\\", he thus makes it his goal to destroy both Zion and The Matrix. Beginning to behave like a virus, he makes multitudinous copies of himself by using humans and other programs in the Matrix as hosts. The copies thereafter display the memories and special abilities of any assimilated programs, such as the Oracle's ability to see the future and control over The Matrix. Smith's ability to copy himself onto others may be a corruption of his original ability to move between hosts before Neo's attack. Neo is shown to be the only person able to withstand such assimilations, Morpheus only being spared because Neo threw off the Smiths that were trying to copy over him; even the Oracle fell victim to the attack, although it apparently required greater effort on Smith's part than usual. Smith eventually assimilates the entire Matrix and is destroyed when Neo, co- operating with the Machines, allows himself to be overwritten by Smith after a protracted fight. Smith's appearance changes slightly once he loses his status as an Agent. His sunglasses take on an angular shape that is an approximation of the rounded lenses Neo uses. His suit changes from dark green to black. In addition, he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo as a warning. The Twins are believed to be Agents of the second Matrix prototype: the 'Hell' Matrix. When the new Matrix versions were created, along with new versions of the Agents, the Twins were seen as worthless and were sentenced to deletion. However, they avoided deletion and become exiles/rogue programs, working for The Merovingian as bodyguards. =Other Agents= Many other agents have appeared in the Animatrix, the Matrix console games, and the Matrix comics. Agents Ash, Bird, Finn, Fine, Gray, and White are the only Agents named there, but other unnamed Agents have appeared as well. Agent White also appears in The Matrix: Path of Neo as a replacement for Smith after the latter was destroyed by Neo. White appears in only one section of the Redpill Rescue level called The Security Guard. He appears much like Agent Brown but has his own personality, and appears to be stronger than both Jones and Brown at the time as he gives Neo a fair degree of difficulty, even while Neo is the One. The Animatrix story World Record featured a different style of Agent wearing full-length trenchcoats instead of the usual dark suit. Notable MMO agents The Agents lived on in the film's continuation, the MMORPG The Matrix Online. In line with the brokered truce created by Neo at the end of The Matrix Revolutions, Agents were no longer assigned to kill redpills on sight. Instead, they guard various areas of the Matrix that are still restricted to the awakened. The Agents revert to their original programming with the collapse of the Truce. =Impostor Agents= Red-Eyed \\"Impostor\\" Agents appeared at the start of The Matrix Online storyline during chapter 1.1. These \\"agents\\" impersonated system representatives and began widespread sabotage and assaults on the awakened redpills in an attempt to stress/break the truce agreement. All three major organizations (Zion, the Machines, and the Merovingian) were quick to deny being responsible for the attacks and the impostors were soon declared the fourth group unto themselves. It was soon discovered that these beings were not agents at all, but rather were using some kind of disguise technology to try to implicate the machines for their actions. Glowing red eyes and lack of system-issue firearms were flaws in the plan. It is revealed in a \\"Report to the General\\" document that the Red-Eyed Agents are the General's, the Exile who used to command the Sentinels, commandos, taking into consideration that programs could gain access to other shells (like the way the Oracle changed appearance in the movies), made occasional documented reports to the General in various Zion and Machine critical missions, and also hinted that their disguises were malfunctioning. = = Gray was one of several Agents trapped in the Matrix during the infestation known as Smith. His program was overwritten with new code, executing instructions which conflicted with his primary architecture. When Smith was defeated and Smith's program was withdrawn from the system, Gray was freed. The Machine Civilization is run by cautious protocols, and there was still some chance that the Smith code had found a place to shelter within the system, or within an RSI. Agents that had been exposed to Smith were quarantined within the Matrix during the reset – something that is usually never done. Bluepills have their connections to the system attenuated so they never notice the event, and Exiles can seek shelter in a construct, but Agents have no such recourse. Those trapped in the system during the reset were literally turned inside out as their code was deconstructed and recompiled with a vicious error-checking routine. Even afterward, he has not been allowed to return to the Source, instead relegated to a buffer system created during the reboot – a gateway construct which acts as a Machine analog to the Merovingian's Mobil Avenue Station. In some ways he is almost an Exile, but for the fact that he believes he will eventually be able to return to the Source. Due to his current situation, Agent Gray was selected to act as recruiter and Controller for human beings that the Machines believe can assist them in controlling the Matrix. Like all Agents, he is normally dispassionate and aloof, with a precise manner of speaking, but his forced dealings with humans have left him with somewhat more understanding of them than most Agents. When dealing with humans, he uses many euphemisms, as he has found that humans often prefer not to say what they really mean. Death is \\"cessation of awareness\\"; stealing is \\"expeditious acquisition\\". He addresses humans by their gender titles and bluepill last name (e.g. \\"Mister Anderson\\"), and seems to have a foolproof way of knowing this information about every human to whom he speaks. Though Gray resented his assignment greatly at first, he has come to appreciate that he is better at dealing with humans than most other machine Agents. Although he does not enjoy interacting with humans, his efficiency at it gives him a sense of pride. Occasionally, a remnant of Smith's code has been known to influence his behavior, causing him to develop a misanthropic and homicidal attitude, as well as greatly increasing his power. Agent Gray is voiced by John Patrick Lowrie. =Agent Pace= Agent Pace is the first female Agent, created in The Matrix Online storyline as an attempt by the Machines to better interact with their human liaisons. Agent Pace is somewhat less stern and more personable than other Agents, and often refers to her human liaisons using Italian terms, almost verging on \\"pet names\\" if AI could be said to use them (similar to how the Merovingian program decided that he prefers French over other human languages, Pace likes Italian). \\"Pace\\" also means \\"peace\\" in Italian.

It is the fifth-highest peakThis is not counting the North Summit of Denali, which is sometimes counted as an independent peak and sometimes not. in the United States and the twelfth-highest peak in North America. The mountain is an old, eroded shield volcano, the second-highest volcano in the U.S. behind Mount Bona and the fifth-highest in North America. It was named in 1885 by Lt. Henry T. Allen of the U.S. Army after Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn, a U.S. senator from Kentucky. It is located in the heart of Wrangell – St. Elias National Park, the largest national park in the country. Description The mountain's massif is covered almost entirely by icefields and glaciers and is the principal source of ice for the Kennicott Glacier, which flows southeast over to just above the town of McCarthy. The mountain also contributes a large volume of ice to the north-flowing Nabesna Glacier and the Kuskulana Glacier system. Mount Blackburn is a large, dramatic peak, with great local relief and independence from higher peaks. Its west face drops over to the Kuskulana Glacier in less than 4 horizontal miles (6.4 km). Its other faces drop , all in less than . The toe of the Kuskulana Glacier, less than from the summit, lies at an elevation of , giving a rise of . While these figures speak to the peak's relief, one measure of its independence is that it is the 50th-most topographically prominent peak in the world. The western of Blackburn's two summits is the mountain's highest point, a fact that was not understood until the 1960s when new USGS maps were published. The first ascent of the west peak, and hence Mount Blackburn, was done on May 30, 1958, by Bruce Gilbert, Dick Wahlstrom, Hans Gmoser, Adolf Bitterlich, and Leon Blumer via the North (also called the Northwest) Ridge. This team made the first ascent of Blackburn but did not even know it at the time due to the incorrect identification of the highest point. Blumer's article in the 1959 American Alpine Journal is titled \\"Mount Blackburn – Second Ascent.\\" The Nabesna Glacier, with Mount Blackburn and its two summits at right; Atna Peaks is the twin summit left of center TOC  Other subfeatures  Mount Blackburn from the west, looking across Willow Lake Kennedy Peak, or East Blackburn, , is the eastern summit and was originally thought to be the highest point. The first ascent of this summit was made in 1912 by Dora Keen and George Handy via the Kennicott Glacier (on the south side of the mountain) and East Face. This heady exploit was ahead of its time. Dora Keen, driven by a deep desire for the climb, solicited miners from the nearby Kennecott Copper Mines, and forged a route up the heavily crevassed East Face to the East Peak, but did not traverse over to the West Peak. Keen went on to write a famous article for the Saturday Evening Post titled, \\"First up Mount Blackburn.\\" In 1912, Keen and Handy thought they were on Blackburn's highest point. Geology Mount Blackburn represents the heavily eroded core of a shield volcano. Because it is shrouded in permanent ice, its internal structure cannot be determined. It is believed to have a summit caldera, greatly modified by glaciation. The oldest rocks in the area are granites, about 4.2 million years old, representing an intrusive mass. The majority of the mountain is 3.4 million year old granite, intruding between andesite flows. From this it is inferred that a caldera collapse took place between 4.2 and 3.4 million years ago, after which activity ceased. Climbing Today's standard route on the peak is the 1958 ascent route, the North (or Northwest) Ridge, which is approached from the Nabesna Glacier, on the north side of the mountain, opposite from Keen and Hardy's route. The route starts from an airstrip on the glacier at an altitude of . It is a moderate climb by Alaskan standards (Alaska Grade 2).

It was their second and final album for Geffen Records. The title track was a significant hit in their native Canada. Following this album, the Junkies were dropped from the Geffen record label. The Junkies moved to an independent label, Latent Recordings, for their subsequent albums.  Album development  Prior to writing new material, Michael Timmins spent a month collecting various segments of lyrical and musical ideas that were accumulated over the past year. At the start of the intended writing process, The Cowboy Junkies heard the news that Townes Van Zandt had died. Van Zandt was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael, showcasing songs that were peep-holes into the soul. Michael wrote the first draft of \\"Blue Guitar\\" the day that he heard Van Zandt died, \\"as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard.\\" However, the song wasn't finished at the time, and was put away for a while. The following month, Michael came into possession of some of Van Zandt's unpublished and unfinished lyrics, including one titled \\"Screams from the Kitchen\\" which had lyrics that just popped out. With permission from Van Zandt's widow, Jeanene Van Zandt, he incorporated the lyrics into the song \\"Blue Guitar\\" which managed to finish off the song, completing the tribute to Van Zandt, and becoming Michael Timmins favorite on the album. The Cowboy Junkies wanted to repeat the process of writing and creating that they used for Lay It Down. Michael Timmins found a house near a gristmill on a pond, a couple hours from Toronto called Maiden's Mill. Michael spent six months at the house writing the songs, and during that period, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down at times to work on a few songs, then let Michael write some more, and then revisit and create some more, until the Junkies were ready to record. The bands plan for the album was to develop the songs minimally at this point, and to use a studio and a good producer to help finish up the work. They searched out a producer, and selected John Leckie who impressed the band with his love of music and his resume of other bands he had worked with. Leckie came over from England and joined the band at Maiden's Mill and spent a few days listening to the songs the band had assembled. Leckie found a recording studio in Toronto called McClear that he liked for its large room and for being well-equipped. In September 1997, the basic tracks were recorded, along with guitar overdubs, and the vocals. Michael Timmins managed to record seven or eight overdubs for the title track, which was his career high for overdubs. Leckie recommended Vince Jones of The Grapes of Wrath for the keyboard work, and he flew in from Vancouver to add piano and organ work for ten tracks in one day. Some of the overdub work was done at another Toronto studio, Chemical, which eventually became one of the Cowboy Junkies favorite studios. When the recording was complete, Leckie took the tracks to London to mix the tracks at Abbey Road. Leckie and the Junkies mixed for three weeks in Studio One, and recorded strings in Studio Two. During this period, the band were constantly reminded of the Beatles previous occupancy of the studios, and somewhat awed by it. At one point, the band ran into Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in the basement cafeteria and shared a brief greeting. Craig Leon wrote out the string arrangements, and Gavyn Wright and a small string orchestra created the music, all the while overseen in a small control room which was crowded with the band, Leckie, two engineers, an agent, and a writer, which added up to a very expensive three hours of a recording session. After a few weeks of mixing, the Cowboy Junkies returned to Canada with a CD. However, after taking a break from all music for a period, the band decided a few of the mixes could be different, so they had Michael Timmins sit with Chris Lord-Alge (Mr. Mixer) at his Los Angeles studio and re-mix several of the tracks for a few days. The theme for Miles from Our Home is 'why?' The tracks deal with the repercussions of the question differently, such as \\"Someone Out There\\" which deals with anger, \\"New Dawn Coming\\" with hope, \\"Miles from Our Home\\" with dignity, and \\"Darkling Day\\" which supplies some answers.

During the mid-1980s, he and accomplice Charles Ng raped, tortured and murdered an estimated 11 to 25 victims at a remote cabin in Calaveras County, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills 150 miles east of San Francisco. After his arrest in 1985 on illegal weapons, auto theft, and fraud charges, Lake swallowed cyanide pills that he had sewn into his clothing, and died four days later. Human remains, videotapes, and journals found at the cabin later confirmed Ng's involvement, and were used to convict him on eleven counts of capital murder.World: \\"America's serial killer sentenced to die\\", BBC News, 30 June 1999, access date 15 August 2013 Early life Lake was born in San Francisco, California. When he was six years old, his parents separated, whereupon he and his siblings moved in with their maternal grandmother. Lake was reportedly a bright child, but after habitually photographing his sisters nude, which his grandmother apparently encouraged, he became obsessed with pornography. He reportedly extorted his sisters to perform sexual acts. He also collected mice and killed them by dissolving them in chemicals, in the same manner he would later dispose of his human victims' corpses. After attending Balboa High School, Lake enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1964. He served two tours of duty in the Vietnam War as a radar electronics technician. During this period, Lake was first diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder. After what was termed a \\"delusional breakdown\\" in Da Nang, he received psychotherapy and, in 1971, a medical discharge. Lake settled in San Jose and enrolled at San Jose State University, but dropped out after one semester upon becoming enamored with the hippie lifestyle in San Francisco. He moved to a commune there, and married briefly in 1975. The marriage dissolved after his wife discovered that he was making and appearing in amateur pornographic movies, usually involving bondage or sadomasochism. For the next eight years, Lake lived at the Greenfield Ranch, a 5,600 acre back-to-the-land settlement near Calpella, north of Ukiah in northern California. There, he met and eventually married Claralyn Balazs — nicknamed \\"Cricket\\" — who became involved in Lake's fantasies and appeared in many of his pornographic films. Lake's growing fear of impending nuclear holocaust prompted him to begin construction of a \\"bunker\\" on the settlement grounds, until the owner of the property became aware of the project and ordered it halted. Murders Lake met fellow Marine Charles Ng through a war gamer magazine advertisement he placed in 1981.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 153 In 1984, Ng was dishonorably discharged after serving time for theft and desertion, and Lake invited him to share a cabin near Wilseyville that he was renting from Balazs. Next to the cabin, Lake had built a structure described in his journals as a \\"dungeon\\". He probably had already murdered his brother Donald and his friend and best man Charles Gunnar, stealing their money and Gunnar's identity. Over the next year, Lake and Ng began a pattern of rape, torture, and murder. Their victims included their neighbor Lonnie Bond, his girlfriend Brenda O'Connor, their infant son Lonnie Jr., and Harvey and Deborah Dubs and their young son Sean. According to court records, they killed the men and infants immediately but kept the women alive, raping and torturing them, before murdering them or allowing them to die from their injuries. Other known victims included relatives and friends who came looking for Bond and O'Connor, two gay men and some workmates of Ng. =Arrest and suicide= On June 2, 1985, Ng was caught shoplifting a vise from a hardware store in San Francisco and fled the scene. Lake later drove to the store and attempted to pay for the vise, but by then police had arrived. Officers noticed that Lake bore no resemblance to the photo on his driving license, which carried the name of Robin Stapley, a San Diego man reported missing by his family several weeks earlier. He was arrested after a gun equipped with a prohibited silencer was found in the trunk of his vehicle, and later positively identified via a fingerprint search. While in custody, Lake swallowed cyanide pills that he had sewn into his clothes, and died four days later. The license plate on Lake's vehicle was registered to him, but the vehicle itself was registered to Paul Cosner, who had disappeared in November 1984. Lake's auto registration led detectives under the command of San Francisco Police Homicide Lieutenant Gerald McCarthy to the property in Wilseyville, where they found Stapley's truck and Bond's car, and behind the cabin, the dungeon. In a makeshift burial site nearby, police unearthed roughly 40 pounds of burned and crushed human bone fragments corresponding to a minimum of 11 bodies. Two bodies, later identified as Bond and Stapley, had been gagged and executed by gunshots to the head. Police also found a hand-drawn \\"treasure map\\", leading them to two buried five-gallon buckets. One contained an assortment of ID papers and personal possessions, suggesting that the total victim count could be as high as 25. In the other were Lake's handwritten journals for the years 1983 and 1984, and two videotapes documenting their torture of Brenda O'Connor and Deborah Dubs. In one of the tapes, Ng is seen telling O'Connor, \\"You can cry and stuff, like the rest of them, but it won't do any good. We are pretty ... cold-hearted, so to speak.\\" In the other, Dubs is shown being assaulted so severely that she \\"could not have survived\\". Lake's wife, Claralyn Balazs, cooperated with investigators and received legal immunity from prosecution. Court records stated that Balazs turned over weapons and other material to authorities during the investigation. Balazs was called as a key witness in Ng's trial in 1999. Yet in a surprise move, Ng's lawyer, William Kelley, dismissed Balazs without asking any questions. Kelley later declined to explain his actions. Balazs was on the witness stand for a few minutes as Kelley read sections of her immunity agreement. Balazs was expected to shed light on what happened inside the mountain cabin that her parents owned. Ng was captured in Calgary, Alberta and eventually extradited to California, where he was indicted on 12 counts of first-degree murder. Despite the video evidence, and the detailed information in Lake's diaries, Ng maintained that he was merely an observer, and that Lake planned and committed all of the kidnaps, rapes, and murders unassisted. In February 1999, Ng was convicted of eleven of the twelve homicides — six men, three women, and two male infants. Jurors deadlocked on the twelfth charge, but Ng was sentenced to death. The presiding judge noted that \\"Mr. Ng was not under any duress, nor does the evidence support that he was under the domination of Leonard Lake.\\" , official California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) records show Ng still waits on death row at San Quentin State Prison.

They use electromagnetic forces instead of a logic gate, a device used to perform solely on specified inputs, to switch the forces of electrons. The unique design of this transistor includes individual electrons bouncing from wedge-shaped obstacles called deflectors. Initially accelerated by electric field, electrons are then guided on their respective paths by electromagnetic deflection. Electrons are therefore able to travel without being scattered by atoms or defects, thus resulting in improved speed and reduced power consumption.  Purpose  A ballistic deflection transistor would be significant in acting as both a linear amplifier and a switch for current flow on electronic devices, which could be used to maintain digital logic and memory. A transistor switching speed is greatly affected by how fast charge carriers (typically, electrons) can cross from one region to the next. For this reason, researchers want to use ballistic conduction to improve the charge-carrier traveling time. The conventional MOS transistors also dissipate a lot of heat due inelastic collisions of electrons and must switch fast in order to reduce time intervals when the heat is generated, reducing their utility in linear circuits.  Advantages  One advantage of the ballistic deflection transistor is that because such device will use very little power (implementing adiabatic circuit), it will produce less heat, and therefore be able to operate faster or with higher duty cycle. Thus, it will be easier to utilize in the variety of applications. This design will also reduce electrical noise that come from the electronic devices. Along with an increased speed, another advantage of the ballistic deflection transistor is that it will be usable in both aspects of linear amplifier and switch. Additionally, the ballistic deflection transistors are intrinsically small, because only small size allows to reduce the role of mechanisms responsible for inelastic scattering of electrons, normally dominating larger devices.  Alternative approaches to ballistic conduction The goal of many laboratories around the world is creating switches and amplifiers that can operate faster than current technology. Specifically, electrons within the device should demonstrate a ballistic conduction behavior. Currently, the silicon MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is the main and leading circuit. However, researchers predict that finding the ideal semiconductor will decrease the dimensions of the transistor, even below the sizes observed in the current generation of the silicon transistors, resulting in many undesirable effects lowering the performance of the MOS transistors. Since early 1960s, there has been research aiming for the ballistic conduction, which lead to modern metal-insulator- metal diodes, but it failed to produce a three-terminal switch. Another approach to ballistic conduction was to reduce scattering by lowering temperature, resulting in superconducting computing. The ballistic deflection transistor comprise the recent (in 2006) design been created by the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility, using a two-dimensional electron gas as the conducting medium. An earlier vacuum-tube device called a beam deflection tube provided a similar functionality based on a similar principle.

It was founded in 1993. As its main program, the organization brings youth and educators from areas of conflict to its camp in Maine. It also provides local programming to support Seeds of Peace graduates, known as Seeds, once they return home. Its mission is to empower youth from conflict regions to work for a better future. History Seeds of Peace began in 1993 as an idea of the American journalist John Wallach. At a state dinner with politicians from Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority, Wallach toasted them, then inspired them to pledge to bring 15 youngsters from each of their respective countries to a new camp he was founding in Maine. These 46, including 3 Americans, ranging in age from 13 to 18, comprised the first session of the Seeds of Peace Camp, founded on the site of the former Camp Powhatan in Otisfield, Maine. The campers from 1993 were later present at the signing ceremony of the Declaration of Principles (better known as the Oslo Accords) in Washington, D.C. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat were photographed holding Seeds of Peace T-shirts. Since its inauguration in 1993, the Camp has produced over 6,000 Seed graduates. There are now Seeds from Egypt, the Palestinian territories, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Pakistan, Maine, Syracuse, New York, Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus/Republic of Cyprus), and the Balkans. The Balkan programs (Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo) and the Cyprus program (Turkish Republic of Cyprus, Republic of Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey) have been discontinued. Campers =Selection Process= The selection process to become a Seeds of Peace camper is very competitive. The selection takes about half a year, with most of the participants being 14–16 years old. Typically, applicants to Seeds of Peace apply through the school systems in their home countries. Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in English and leadership skills, local politics, and are selected on the basis of interviews and written essays. Many of the first time campers are chosen by the Ministries of Education or other government agencies in their respective countries. =Costs= Attending the camp costs $2500 for the three and a half week stay, plus the costs of airfare. Campers are asked to contribute $1200 to help defray costs, but selected campers are not turned away if unable to pay. Sponsor countries often contribute to the camp fees and airfare as well. Organization John Wallach's vision focused on leaders of the next generation—on Seeds who will one day be in positions of power. In the first years of the camp, it became clear that to realize this vision the organization needed the support of people in the regions of conflict in positions of power now. This need to establish legitimacy on the ground at home inspired the creation of the Delegation Leaders Program. Delegation Leaders are educators from the countries in conflict; they take part in the selection and orientation of Seeds at home. They accompany the Seeds to and from camp. At the camp, they are they eyes and ears of the parents, of their communities; at the same time, they engage in an intense encounter experience of their own. After camp, they are invited to join the growing circles of support for Seeds of Peace. These many years of conflict resolution programming has produced an impressive cadre of Seeds working in international affairs, politics, business, medicine, nonprofit and media. Headquartered in New York City, Seeds of Peace also has offices in Amman, Cairo, Gaza, Jerusalem, Kabul, Lahore, Mumbai, Otisfield, Ramallah and Tel Aviv. While at camp, participants speak English, the common language of the camp, in order to open the lines of communication between national and ethnic groups. Camp is the potential beginning of a long process, of relationships that grow. The adjustment to life at home after camp can be difficult, especially when the political conditions are less than encouraging. To aid in this transition, the organization supports returning Seeds with year-round programming, including dialogue sessions, cross-cultural visits, educational and leadership development workshops and outreach events. These activities work to sustain the relationships and ideals developed in the International Camp, supporting the Seeds' lifelong commitments to sustaining promoting dialogue and understanding in their home regions. In 2001, Seeds of Peace expanded to South Asia. Seeds in this region are active leaders through various programs that bring together conflicting sides from Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. =Asel Asleh= Asel Asleh at Seeds of Peace On October 2, 2000, Asel Asleh, an Israeli Arab and graduate of the program, was killed by Israeli security forces during a demonstration. He was wearing the Seeds of Peace T-shirt at the time of the shooting and was subsequently buried in it. Leadership John Wallach, the founder of the organization, also served as its president until his death in 2002. He was succeeded by former State Department official Aaron David Miller, who left the job early in 2006. Later, Janet Wallach, wife of John Wallach, was named president emeritus and Steven Flanders served for a time as the executive officer in charge. Starting in the spring of 2007, Nicolla Hewitt served briefly as President, until her departure in 2008. In the fall of 2009, the organization announced a new Executive Director, Leslie Adelson Lewin. Offices The organization's U.S. headquarters is located in New York City. Seeds of Peace also has opened central offices in Jerusalem and smaller offices in Amman, Lahore, Mumbai and Kabul. With the support of Seeds of Peace staff, and growing networks of older \\"Seeds,\\" Delegation Leaders and parents, the young graduates of the Camp continue activities across borders and within their own communities. Programs for older Seeds—people in their 20s—are expanding as the organization meets the needs of Seeds moving through new phases of life. The Olive Branch From 1996-2012, the organization's graduates published a magazine, The Olive Branch, that summed up their activities over a period of several months. It included reports, poetry, essays, and photos. Life after camp Palestinian, Israeli Arab and Jewish Israeli Seeds Approximately 350 new Seeds graduate from Seeds of Peace every summer. After camp, the organization runs year-round regional programs for graduates in their home countries that focus on \\"four of the most important assets and abilities that leaders in conflict regions need to create meaningful change: strong relationships across lines of conflict; a sophisticated understanding of core conflict issues; practical skills in communication, critical thinking, and change-making; and the ability to take action on behalf of peace.\\" Author John Wallach himself dedicated his book \\"The Enemy Has a Face: The Seeds of Peace Experience\\" to the organization.  Regional Programs  These events are organised by the regional branches of Seeds of peace and students who have attended the Seeds Of Peace Maine Camp, (a.k.a. \\"seeds\\") take an active role in the same. Criticism Seeds of Peace has been criticized by some for its perceived contriving of a false equivalence between the actions of the Israelis and those the Palestinians by omitting the larger historical context of the conflict, and for not being sufficiently critical of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.Can we talk? The Middle East “peace industry” Electronic Intifada A survey of the Palestinian teens attending the program shows that they are disproportionately represented by \\"children of friends of high-ranking officials or economic elites. Only 7 percent of participants were refugee camp residents, even though they make up 16 percent of the Palestinian population.\\" The survey also shows little or no long-term impact of the program with 91 percent said they were no longer in contact with any Israelis that they had met through the program. 93 percent said there was no follow-up to camp activity that they had participated in. Only 5 percent agreed that their program had helped \\"promote peace culture and dialogue between participants.\\" Only 11 percent came away believing that \\"there is something that unites us with the other party\\"\\" In a fantasy-theme analysis of Seeds of Peace publications, Engstrom (2007) argues that organizations like Seeds of Peace unknowingly participate in sustaining the conflicts they seeks to eliminate. This is done by a promoted rhetoric of deferred peace that places the burden of ending the conflict on future generations. Politicians and other stakeholders in the current conflict use their support for Seeds of Peace as a signal of their commitment to peace while remaining committed to military engagement in the present. By continuously promoting peace as something that exists in the future, politicians can maintain the status quo and undermine the power of institutions working for peace today.

His organization, Gilbert Deya Ministries, claims that Deya is able to help infertile women to conceive through the power of prayer. Background Deya was born in the morning of 2 February 1937 in Juja, Kiambu County, outside of Nairobi and was the eleventh child in a family of fifteen children. He belongs to Luo tribe, and his name \\"Juma\\" means Sunday, which is the day he was born. His father, Samuel Oyanda Deya was a sisal plantations worker from Bondo working in Juja. His parents were never meant to be a couple because his mother, Monica Nono Deya, declined the arranged marriage with his father. He attended primary school but the school preacher dropped out because of bullying and poverty. He started preaching Jinja, Kampala, in Uganda, where he beat up a woman for hitting the children of his sister and worked there as a porter. He married his 14-year-old wife, Mary Anyango, on 27 December 1958 when he was 21. They gave birth to fifteen children in total. He started the \\"Salvation of Jesus Christ Church\\" in 1976. He was ordained by the United Evangelical Church of Kenya and styles himself \\"Archbishop\\". He was an evangelist in Kenya in the late 1980s to early 1990s, but moved to the UK, establishing Gilbert Deya Ministries in 1997. The ministry now has churches in Liverpool, London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Luton, Reading, and Manchester, Sheffield and in 2006 acquired a building and planning permission in Leeds. The church claims to be \\"the fastest growing Ministry in the UK and worldwide\\". 'Miracle Babies' & child trafficking The Gilbert Deya Ministries claim that Deya's powers allow him to be able to cause infertile women to become pregnant. Deya claims that \\"through the power of prayer and the Lord Jesus\\" he has helped sterile women give birth. In the UK, one woman is claimed to have had three children in less than a year. The women travelled to Kenya in order to \\"give birth\\". Deya's wife, Eddah (also known as Mary Deya), was arrested during November 2004 in Nairobi and charged with stealing children. Ten children, none of whom had any genetic connection to the Deya family, were found at Deya's House. Twenty babies have been placed in foster care in Kenya after DNA tests showed they had no connection to their alleged mothers. Rose Atieno Kiserem, a former pastor with Deya's ministry was jailed along with Mrs. Deya. Upon her release from jail, Kiserem confessed that the 'miracle babies' were \\"a hoax created by the Deyas and their accomplices to deceive me and other God-fearing people.\\" Deya has a warrant out for his arrest in Kenya for the trafficking of babies out of the country. The Kenyan police have alleged that the ministry is a baby-snatching ring, and they have petitioned for his extradition from the UK. Deya is seeking political asylum from his base in Glasgow. He was arrested by police at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in 2006. In November 2004 the High Court in the UK ruled that a 'miracle baby' in London was the victim of child trafficking, and that the supposed miracle displayed was a ruse in order to generate funds from a \\"deceived congregation\\". Justice Ryder ruled that in order to maintain the illusion of a genuine birth, the child's 'mother' was seriously assaulted \\"and a live child who had been born to another family was presented to her as her child.\\" He also ruled that \\"[the baby's] birth as described was a falsehood not a miracle.\\" On 13 December 2006, Deya was arrested in London by the Metropolitan Police. A police spokesman said Gilbert Deya was detained under an arrest warrant issued by Kenyan authorities, who had charged him with child abduction and trafficking. He was ordered by a court on 8 November 2007, to be extradited from the UK to Kenya to face five counts of child stealing. Deya appealed against extradition on the grounds that he might face torture in Kenya, but in late 2008 his case was rejected by the High Court and leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. It was reported in April 2010 that Deya was still in England and that David Lammy, Deya's MP, had enquired of the government why he had not yet been extradited. Lammy was concerned that justice was being denied to several of his constituents who were victims of the trafficked babies fraud. The Home Office responded that it was still considering representations from Deya's solicitors that sending him to Kenya would breach his human rights. In September 2011, news reports indicated that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted and Deya would now be extradited to Kenya. In December 2011, a court in Kenya cleared Mary Deya of obtaining registration for five children irregularly. The London Evening Standard reported on 21 October 2016 that Deya had applied for a judicial review of the decision to extradite him. On 12 July 2017, Premier Christian Media reported that the High Court had refused Deya's application for a judicial review and that he would be extradited. On 3 August 2017, Deya was extradited from the UK to Kenya to face child trafficking charges. He was immediately arraigned in court for child trafficking offences.

It broadcasts to the North East on 1152 AM and on DAB radio. History Magic 1152 logo used from 1998 to 2015. Great North Radio or G.N.R as it was sometimes called was formed in March 1989 using the AM frequencies of Metro Radio and Radio Tees . This happened after the Metro Radio group decided to split the FM and AM frequencies up. GNR's output consisted of mellow music from the 1950s through to the 1980s, including current hits that fitted the format. There were also specialist programmes each evening, including Country Music, Jazz, and Classical. In 1996, Emap bought Metro Radio and at the start of 1997, Emap decided to scrap Great North Radio and replaced it with local stations under the brandname of Magic, with a new format of Hot Adult Contemporary music. Magic 1152 launched on 19 February 1997. In December 2001, EMAP decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes and in line with the other Magic AM stations began networking between 10am-2pm, and 7pm-6am. During these hours it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour. In January 2003 after a sharp decline in listening, the station ceased networking with the London station, Magic 105.4, and a regional northern network was created with Manchester's Magic 1152 at the hub at the weekend and the Newcastle station as the hub during the week. This arrangement remained until 2006, when all network programmes were broadcast from Newcastle. During networked hours, local adverts are aired, as well as a local news summary on the hour during the day. IRN is taken in the evening and overnight. From July 2006, more networking was introduced across the Northern Magic AM network leaving just the legal minimum of 4 hours a day of programming - the breakfast show - presented from the local studios. All other programming was networked from Newcastle however some is also produced in Manchester and now London. Shows are recorded also on Saturdays from 1-6pm. On 4 March 2013, the one remaining local show - weekday breakfast - became a syndicated regional programme as on this day the programme, presented by Anna Foster, started broadcasting on Tees-side sister station Magic 1170.Magic AM starts networking at breakfast Radio Today, 15 February 2013 The regional breakfast show was axed in December 2014 ahead of the launch of Metro 2 and all programming is networked with the other Bauer AM stations in the North although local news, weather and travel continue to be broadcast as opt-outs during the day.

The term appears to have originated from the work of Antonio Gramsci, specifically from his conception of superstructure. Chantal Mouffe, Stuart Hall, and others have adopted or used it.Middleton, Richard [1990] (2002). Studying Popular Music. Philadelphia: Open University Press. . p. 8-9 Articulation (expression) theorizes the relationship between components of social formation or relationship between cultural and political economy. In this theory, cultural forms and practices (Antonio Gramsci's superstructure and Richard Middleton's instance or level of practice) have relative autonomy; socio-economic structures of power do not determine them, but rather they relate to them. \\"The theory of articulation recognizes the complexity of cultural fields. It preserves a relative autonomy for cultural and ideological elements ... but also insists that those combinatory patterns that are actually constructed do mediate deep, objective patterns in the socio-economic formation, and that the mediation takes place in struggle: the classes fight to articulate together constituents of the cultural repe[r]toire in particular ways so that they are organized in terms of principles or sets of values determined by the position and interests of the class in the prevailing mode of production.\\" This is because \\"the relationship between actual culture...on the one hand, and economically determined factors such as class position, on the other, is always problematical, incomplete, and the object of ideological work and struggle. ... Cultural relationships and cultural change are thus not predetermined; rather they are the product of negotiation, imposition, resistance, transformation, and so on....Thus particular cultural forms and practices cannot be attached mechanically or even paradigmatically to particular classes; nor, even, can particular interpretations, valuations, and uses of a single form or practice. In Stuart Hall's words (1981: 238), 'there are no wholly separate \\"cultures\\"...attached, in a relation of historical fixity, to specific \\"whole\\" classes'. However, \\"while elements of culture are not directly, eternally, or exclusively tied to specific economically determined factors such as class position, they are determined in the final instance by such factors, through the operation of articulating principles which are tied to class position\\". Articulating principles \\"operate by combining existing elements into new patterns or by attaching new connotations to them\\". Examples of these processes in musical culture include the re-use of elements of bourgeois marches in labor anthems or the assimilation of liberated (in the Marcusian sense) countercultural 1960s rock into a tradition of bourgeois bohemianism and the combination of elements of black and white working-class music with elements of art music that created countercultural 1960s rock. Some scholars may prefer the theory of articulation, where \\"class does not coincide with the sign community\\",Volosinov, V. I. (1973) Marxism and the Philosophy of Language. New York: Seminar Press. p. 23 to the theory of homology, where class does coincide with the sign community and where economic forces determine the superstructure. However, \\"it seems likely that some signifying structures are more easily articulated to the interests of one group than are some others\\" and cross-connotation, \\"when two or more different elements are made to connote, symbolize, or evoke each other\\", can set up \\"particularly strong articulative relationships\\". For example: Elvis Presley's linking of elements of \\"youth rebellion, working-class 'earthiness', and ethnic 'roots', each of which can evoke the others, all of which were articulated together, however briefly, by a moment of popular self-assertion\\".

The band was started by ten-year-old J.P. (Jean-Paul) Toulon and his nine-year-old brother, Jamie Toulon, with encouragement from their father Vern Toulon, a longtime member of the Madison punk scene who had spent time in New York City, where he was a guitarist for the industrial band Missing Foundation. History =Formation, Get Outta School= The original lineup featured J.P. on guitar and Jamie on keyboards and came together after the brothers began playing with their father's instruments. After teaching the boys some basic chords, he added a drum machine and the band was formed. Soon after, ten-year-old Jesse Collins-Davies joined the band on drums. Collins- Davies was the stepson of Robin Davies, a member of the Madison-based punk band the Tar Babies, who had previously recorded for SST Records. The group adapted their name from the punk rock band Live Skull, who had stayed at the Toulon house after a show in Madison. After hearing a demo tape the band recorded, Mojo Nixon approached his label, Restless Records, and persuaded them to sign Old Skull to a record deal. In 1989, Restless Records released Old Skull's debut album, Get Outta School. Produced by both Vern Toulon and Robin Davies and engineered by future Garbage member Steve Marker, Get Outta School dealt with such wide-ranging topics as skateboarding, hot dogs, homelessness and the AIDS virus. Due to the non-childlike subject matter in many of the songs, rumors persisted that Vern Toulon was actually ghostwriting much, if not all of the band's material. Critics described the album as hilarious, unlistenable and torturous, though most agreed that it wasn't all that bad for a group of nine-year-olds. The band also began opening for national acts such as Gwar, The Flaming Lips and Sonic Youth. The novelty of the act drew media attention from television shows like A Current Affair and publications such as Life, People and Newsweek. MTV also gave the band some minor airplay. A music video was released for the song \\"Homeless\\". After the release of Get Outta School, Jesse Collins-Davies left the band and was replaced by twelve-year-old Graham Lindsey. Lindsey performed with the band for two years before the band permanently broke up. =New lineup, C.I.A. Drug Fest= In 1992, the Toulon brothers re-formed Old Skull without Lindsey. J.P. Toulon switched to drums, while Jamie, now known as Spike, handled bass and some lead vocals. The Toulons were joined by brothers Josh and Chris Scott on guitars and vocals respectively. This lineup recorded C.I.A. Drug Fest, once again produced by Vern Toulon and released through Restless, and released during that year. This record was considerably more musical than their debut and executed competently with relative cohesion. A music video was released for the song \\"Pizza Man\\". A short tour of Japan followed before the act disbanded permanently in 1993. =2005 reunion= In August 2005, the Toulon brothers, now in their mid-20s, reunited Old Skull for a one time show at CBGB's as an opening act for The Exploited, with J.P. returning to vocals and Jamie playing guitar. They were joined onstage by Rik Smart, Mike House and John McClellan of the New York squat punk music scene. =Adult life= J.P. Toulon moved to New York City where he began playing with Planned Collapse, a crust punk band based out of C-Squat, a communal squat located in the East Village of Manhattan. In early 2010, he served jail time in Madison, Wisconsin, and later moved on to a drug rehab facility where he had apparently managed to overcome his drug addiction. J.P. Toulon died on November 13, 2010, his brother Jamie's birthday. He had been living in Minneapolis with his son at the time of his death. While the cause of death never been made public, Toulon had previously been hospitalized for pancreatitis several times in the months prior to his death. A memorial service was held for Toulon at C-Squat on November 21, 2010. Jamie Toulon went on to play guitar for the Milwaukee band Doomsday Cauldron. Like his brother, he later moved to New York City and played in a punk band named Apox, which released an album titled Prevalence in 1998. He was also an original member of Star Fucking Hipsters, a side project of Leftöver Crack member, Stza. Jamie also joined his brother in Planned Collapse until both brothers left the band. Clay Pigeon, a WFMU DJ who often records conversations with random NYC street people, included a fifteen-minute interview with Jamie on his August 26, 2010, broadcast. In the interview, Jamie revealed that he was living on the streets of New York City and was battling an ongoing drug addiction. Jamie committed suicide in Lynchburg, Virginia on June 10, 2011, seven months after the death of his brother. Jesse Collins-Davies, using the name DJ Jesse Collins, continued to perform as part of the drum and bass/jungle music scene of Madison. He also has a career as an abstract artist, primarily working in the medium of watercolor on glass. Graham Lindsey began a solo career as an alternative country artist. He released his first album, Famous Anonymous Wilderness, in 2003. A second album, Hell Under The Skullbones, followed in 2006. In 2008 he released The Mine EP and his third full-length album, We Are All Alone In This Together. A compilation album of rarities titled, Digging Up Birds: A Collection of Rarities & Others was released in 2014. Four of Lindsey's songs were used in the direct-to-DVD film, Fairview St., released in 2009. Lindsey is also a backup musician for The Perreze Farm, a band formed by Lindsey's drummer, Joe Perreze. They released their debut EP, Songs For The Birds, on May 26, 2009. Vern Toulon, producer and father to the Toulon brothers, went on to appear in the Madison-based documentary film Streets Without Cars before his death on May 31, 2001, at the age of 46. Several reports indicate that he had resorted to panhandling in the years before his death. The boys' parents had divorced early in the band's career. Several years after the divorce, the boys' mother died in a train accident. Legacy Months before the 2005 reunion, a person named \\"P.J.\\" called into the radio station WFMU in New Jersey, claiming to be a former member of Old Skull. \\"P.J.\\" stated that he was re-forming Old Skull as a jazz fusion band without the input of any of the other former members. The call turned out to be an elaborate comedy sketch set up by Tom Scharpling, a supervising producer and writer for the Monk television series, and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster, for their radio show, The Best Show on WFMU. The sketch also became available on their Hippy Justice CD. Coincidentally, the Hippy Justice CD was released at approximately the same time that the real reunion at CBGB's took place.

He is believed to have raped, tortured and murdered between 11 and 25 victims with his accomplice Leonard Lake at Lake's cabin in Calaveras County, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, 60 miles from Sacramento. After his 1985 arrest and imprisonment in Canada on robbery and weapons charges, followed by a lengthy dispute between Canada and the US, Ng was extradited to California, tried, and convicted of 11 murders. He is currently on death row at San Quentin State Prison. Early life Ng was born in British Hong Kong, the son of a wealthy Hongkonger executive and his wife. As a child, Ng was harshly disciplined and abused by his father. As a teenager, he was described as a troubled loner and was expelled from several schools. After his arrest for shoplifting at age 15, he went, at his father's insistence, to Bentham Grammar School, a boarding school in North Yorkshire, England. Not long after arriving, Ng was expelled for stealing from other students and returned to Hong Kong. Ng moved to the United States on a student visa in 1978, and studied biology at the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, California. He dropped out after one semester. At that time, he met Leonard Lake. Soon after, he was involved in a hit and run accident, and to avoid prosecution he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. U.S. Marine Corps Ng became a Marine in 1979 with the help, he claimed, of a recruiting sergeant and false documents attesting to his birth in Bloomington, Indiana. After less than a year of service, he was arrested by military police for theft of automatic weapons from MCAS Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii. Facing court-martial, he escaped custody in 1980 and made his way back to northern California, where he reunited with Lake. In 1982, federal authorities raided the mobile home they shared in Ukiah, seizing a large stash of illegal weapons and explosives. Lake was released on $6,000 bond. He jumped bail and drifted around the state, using a series of pseudonyms. Ng was returned to the Marines' custody and pleaded guilty to the theft and desertion charges. Under the terms of his plea deal, he was paroled and discharged in 1984 after serving 18 months in the military stockade at the United States Disciplinary Barracks Fort Leavenworth.United States vs Charles Ng. Murders After his release, Ng immediately contacted Lake, who was renting a remote cabin near Wilseyville in Calaveras County and invited Ng to join him. Next to the cabin, Lake had built a structure described in his journals as a \\"dungeon\\". He probably had already murdered his brother Donald and his friend and best man Charles Gunnar, stealing their money and Gunnar's identity. Over the next year, Lake and Ng began a pattern of rape, torture and murder. Their victims included their neighbour Lonnie Bond; their neighbor’s girlfriend, Brenda O'Connor; Lonnie Jr., the Bonds’ infant son; Harvey Dubs; Deborah Dubs; and their young son Sean. According to court records, they killed the men and infants immediately but kept the women alive, raping and torturing them, before murdering them or allowing them to die from their injuries. Other known victims included relatives and friends who came looking for Bond and O'Connor, two gay men and some workmates of Ng. The duo's rampage might have gone on longer were it not for Ng's kleptomania. On 2 June 1985, Ng was caught shoplifting a vise from a South San Francisco hardware store and fled the scene. Lake later drove to the store and attempted to pay for the vise, but by then the police had arrived. Officers noticed that Lake bore no resemblance to the photo on his driver's licence, which carried the name of Robin Stapley, a San Diego man reported missing by his family several weeks earlier. After a gun equipped with a prohibited silencer was found in the trunk of Lake's vehicle, he was arrested and positively identified via a fingerprint search. In custody, while awaiting arraignment, Lake swallowed a cyanide pill he had sewn into his clothes and died four days later in the hospital. The license plate on Lake's vehicle was registered to him, but the vehicle itself was registered to Paul Cosner, who had disappeared in November 1984. Lake's auto registration led detectives to the property in Wilseyville, where they found Stapley's truck and Bond's car, and behind the cabin, the dungeon. In a makeshift burial site nearby, police unearthed roughly 40 pounds of burned and crushed human bone fragments corresponding to a minimum of 11 bodies. They also found a hand-drawn \\"treasure map,\\" leading them to two buried five-gallon buckets. One contained envelopes with names and victims' IDs, suggesting that the total number of victims might have been as high as 25. In the other bucket were Lake's handwritten journals for the years 1983 and 1984, and two videotapes documenting the torture of two of their victims. In one of the tapes, Ng is seen telling victim Brenda O'Connor, \\"You can cry and stuff, like the rest of them, but it won't do any good. We are pretty ... cold-hearted, so to speak.\\" In the other, Deborah Dubs is shown being assaulted so severely that she \\"could not have survived.\\" Ng, meanwhile, had fled to Calgary, Alberta, where his sister lived.Calgary man who helped capture Charles Ng hits the road to find redemption, healing and a killer . Calgary Herald (March 5, 2016). Retrieved May 30, 2017. He lived, undetected, in a lean-to in Fish Creek Provincial Park until his penchant for theft did him in yet again. On 6 July 1985, he was arrested by the Calgary Police Service after shooting security guard Sean Doyle in the hand while resisting arrest for stealing a can of salmon from a Calgary department store. He was charged and subsequently convicted of shoplifting, assault with a weapon, and possession of a concealed firearm, and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. After serving his sentence, he remained incarcerated pending an extradition request from California authorities. Ng fought a protracted legal battle against extradition on the grounds that Canada, which does not have the death penalty, would be violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by permitting him to stand trial in California for capital murder. A habeas corpus petition and an appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal were both denied. In 1991, the Supreme Court of Canada also ruled against him, and he was extradited to California later that year. Murder trial In Calaveras County, Ng was indicted on twelve counts of first degree murder. After a change of venue to Orange County, he initiated a protracted series of pretrial motions. He sued the state over his temporary detainment at Folsom Prison, where he was caught hiding maps, fake IDs, and other escape paraphernalia, and filed challenges against four of the judges assigned to his case. He lodged a long series of complaints regarding the strength of his eyeglasses, the temperature of his food, and his right to practice origami in his jail cell. Ng went through a total of 10 attorneys, some of whom ended up defending him a second time. He also filed a malpractice suit against several of the attorneys, citing incompetent representation. After claiming that he had lost trust and confidence in all of his lawyers, he was allowed to represent himself, which delayed the trial another year while he researched applicable laws. His trial finally began six years after his extradition in October 1998. Leonard Lake's wife, Claralyn Balazs, cooperated with investigators and received legal immunity from prosecution. Court records stated that Balazs turned over weapons and other material to authorities during the investigation. Balazs was called as a key witness in Ng's trial in 1999. Ng's lawyer, William Kelley, in a surprise move, dismissed Balazs without asking any questions. Kelley later declined to explain his actions. Balazs was on the witness stand for a few minutes as Kelley read sections of her immunity agreement. Balazs was expected to shed light on what happened inside the mountain cabin that her parents owned. Despite the video evidence and information in Lake's voluminous diaries, Ng maintained that he was merely an observer, and that Lake planned and committed all of the kidnappings, rapes, and murders unassisted. He further maintained that he was dependent upon Lake for direction, that the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father was a mitigating factor, and that his good behaviour behind bars showed that he should be imprisoned for life rather than executed.World: \\"America's serial killer sentenced to die\\" , BBC News, 30 June 1999, access date 15 August 2013 Psychiatrist Stuart Grassian testified that Ng had dependent personality disorder, but admitted under cross-examination that he had not viewed the tapes that showed Ng participating in the crimes. Clinical psychologist Abraham Nievod agreed with the diagnosis of dependent personality disorder, and opined that Ng's behavior in the tapes indicated that he was attempting to \\"mirror\\" and please Lake. Four prison guards, two sheriff's deputies, a prison library employee, and a prison counselor all testified that Ng was a model prisoner. Four former Marines who had known Ng while he was serving in the Marine Corps testified that he was quiet and well-behaved. Ng's parents both testified about his troubled childhood, and expressed remorse for their son's actions. Ng insisted on taking the stand in his own defence, which allowed prosecutors to introduce additional evidence that helped define Ng's role in all aspects of the crimes. One significant item was a photo of Ng in his prison cell, with cartoons he had sketched of his victims hanging on the wall behind him.Serial Killer Charles Ng – A Master of Legal Manipulation . ThoughtCo.com (March 1, 2016). Retrieved March 23, 2017. In February 1999, Ng was convicted of eleven of the twelve homicides: six men, three women, and two male infants; jurors deadlocked on the twelfth charge. Ng was sentenced to death, and the presiding judge rejected a motion to reduce the jury's verdict to life imprisonment. \\"Mr. Ng was not under any duress,\\" he said, \\"nor does the evidence support that he was under the domination of Leonard Lake.\\" Ng's prosecution cost the State of California approximately $20 million, at the time the most expensive trial in the state's history. , Ng remains on death row at San Quentin State Prison.

Early life and career Borrell's father, New Zealand-born John Borrell, was a war correspondent; his mother was a primary school teacher in Tottenham. His parents divorced when he was young. Borrell lived at Highgate, where he attended Highgate School. Borrell was involved in music and the Camden scene while still at school. At 17 he played bass guitar in a band called Violet, who regularly played gigs on the Camden circuit. The band recorded an EP and started to gain some recognition before splitting acrimoniously live on stage at Dublin Castle in late '97 . The title track of the EP was subsequently used in the soundtrack of the 1998 Michael Winterbottom film 'I Want You'. After the split, he briefly switched to being a solo artist covering The Clash and Lead Belly songs. Many of these shows were played with close friends The Libertines. Through his friendship with schoolmate John Hassall, at Highgate School, Borrell was involved in the early formation of The Libertines. He was present at the sessions for their debut album Up The Bracket and appears as a character in songs, notably \\"Boy Looked at Johnny\\" and \\"Death on the Stairs\\", and also \\"What a Waster\\" which appeared as a bonus track on the album in Japan. In 2002 he went on to form his own band which played house parties, rehearsing at a Hackney warehouse called Unit 13, comprising Carl Dalemo, Shïan Smith-Pancorvo (later replaced by Andy Burrows) and Björn Ågren. The band were watching a video recording of themselves playing a gig and misheard the ending refrain 'Its alright, it's alright' from the song \\"In The City\\" as 'razor-light, razor-light' which was then chosen as the band name. In early 2003 XFM DJ John Kennedy began to play the band's demos, recorded at Toerag Studios in east London with producers Liam Watson and John Fortis. Razorlight signed to Mercury Records on 23 May 2003 after the Universal label fought off bids from Sony. After the number 8 single \\"Golden Touch\\", their debut album, Up All Night, was released on 28 June 2004, and charted at number 3 in the UK. The critical reception was generally good, receiving good reviews from NME (\\"Razorlight's debut packs more tunes than Franz [Ferdinand], more spirit than The Strokes and more balls than nearly every band out there right now.\\"), Q magazine, Billboard and Rolling Stone who said \\"Razorlight's debut is a masterpiece. [Borrell]'s got the golden rock-star mop, the London sneer and a band full of crazy Swedes. But fortunately, he's also got the tunes.” Michael Parkinson saw coverage of the band performing at Glastonbury Festival and invited them onto his TV show. Razorlight performed \\"Golden Touch\\" with a gospel choir in front of the Parkinson studio audience and guest Tom Cruise. After 2004's constant touring Borrell was placed at No. 4 in NME's Cool List and Razorlight won Best New Act at 2004's Q Awards and the Best New Band category at the NME Awards in February 2005. French fashion brand Dior's creative director Hedi Slimane based his 2005 Autumn/Winter collection on Borrell and Pete Doherty and chose Razorlight to write music for the Paris show. In the Spring of 2005 Razorlight played two sold out shows at London's Alexandra Palace with Noel Fielding from The Mighty Boosh as their support act. Meanwhile, in between-album's single \\"Somewhere Else\\" reached number 2 in the UK charts. Q Magazine called it: “A punk rock symphony, a thrilling change in direction\\", and high-profile support slots with U2, Queen, The Who and Oasis and the band's appearance at Live 8 kept Razorlight occupied through the rest of the year prior to entering the studio for their second album in early 2006. The self-titled follow up was produced by Pretenders, Sex Pistols and Roxy Music producer Chris Thomas. First single 'In The Morning' went to number 3, and when the album was released on 17 July 2006 it gave the band their first number 1 in the UK album chart. The NME gave the album 8/10 and said: “A soulful romantic album that sees Razorlight comfortably leap the ‘difficult second album’ trap” whilst The Observer Music Monthly gave it 4/5 saying \\"[Borrell's] band's second album justifies the self-belief.\\" Q Magazine called it \\"The best guitar album since Oasis's 'Definitely Maybe'” 2006 saw Borrell and the band grow into an arena act and extend their international reach. Second single 'America' went straight to number 1 in the UK on 14 October dominating UK radio charts to the end of the year, and climbing airplay and singles charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Japan and America. The Rolling Stones asked the band to support them in Europe. An autumn UK arena tour culminated in a sold out Wembley Arena show and tours of Japan, Europe and the US led into a second UK arena tour and a sold out show at London's 17,000 capacity Earl's Court in April 2007. Razorlight were the only UK band to headline the main stage at Reading Festival in August 2007. The Razorlight singer next emerged in October, duetting with The Kinks' Ray Davies on 'Sunny Afternoon' for the BBC Electric Proms at London's The Roundhouse. In late 2007 Borrell secluded himself on a remote Scottish island in the Outer Hebrides to begin writing for the band's third album. 2008's London sessions at Air studios lead to a more contemplative third album titled 'Slipway Fires'. The album went to number 4 in the UK album charts in November 2008 and first single 'Wire To Wire' got to number 5. Press reaction to the record was mixed although Q's Paul Rees gave the record 4/5 and said: “Borrell and his band come up triumphant. It does what third albums traditionally used to do, which is to say, have the confidence the leap into the previously unknown, and for that, all credit to Borrell\\". In Germany ‘Wire To Wire' was the sixth biggest chart hit of 2009 and the album went gold. Two round the world tours, including first visits to Australia, a move to a new label, Mercury Records/Island Def Jam and major festival appearances in the UK and across Europe took Razorlight to the end of the decade, finishing with a December headline at XFM's Brixton Academy Christmas show where they donated their fee to Borrell's charity of choice, Anno's Africa. December 2009 also saw the digital release of a documentary on Razorlight made by UK film director Charles Henri-Belleville. Titled 'Rock'n’Roll Lies' the 70-minute film follows the band on a week of UK shows intercut with band member interviews about Razorlight's history. The film also features bonus material including Borrell's charity hovercraft crossing of the English Channel and drummer Andy Burrows' trials and tribulations whilst giving up smoking while on tour. Solo work Borrell's debut solo album, Borrell 1, was released in July 2013 in the UK. It was produced by Trevor Horn and received mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100, the album received an average score of 46, based on 9 reviews by mainstream critics. The album was a commercial failure, selling 594 copies in its first week on sale and failed to secure a position in the UK Albums Chart. Reputation and charity work Borrell has sometimes been regarded as having a very arrogant attitude towards the press and is famous for his proclamations of his own abilities such as claiming he thinks he's the greatest songwriter in the world on MTV's Gonzo hosted by Zane Lowe. However, like many other artists who come across negatively in NME interviews, Borrell and supporters have accused the magazine of misrepresentation and emphasising quotes out of context. Borrell has made numerous contributions to charity. Razorlight recorded 'Kirby's House' for the 2005 Warchild album and played London, Royal Albert Hall shows in 2006 and 2008 for The Who's Teenage Cancer Trust events (in 2008 the band performed 'Summertime Blues' with Roger Daltrey). In 2006 Borrell started to work for Friends of the Earth's climate change campaign 'The Big Ask', a relationship which has continued through 2006's show in Trafalgar Square for the 'icount' campaign to playing at FOE's November 2009 Hammersmith Apollo fundraiser. Razorlight were deemed to be one of the highlights of 2 July 2005 Live 8 charity concert in Hyde Park and continued to support Borrell's global warming concerns by taking part in 7 July 2007 Live Earth event at Wembley Stadium. Borrell is one of few amongst his contemporary generation of stars to have appeared on the cover of a national UK newspaper because of his political views. On 4 November 2006 his essay on climate change was the front cover story of The Independent. Razorlight have also regularly supported Nelson Mandela's 46664 Aids charity. In July 2005 the band flew to Tromso, Norway to play a 46664 fundraiser. Mandela invited Razorlight to perform at his 1 December 2007 World Aids day concert in Johannesburg, which allowed the band to visit township AIDs projects. Borrell also worked with environmentally friendly charity Global Cool on their 2007 green campaigns. They also played at Mandela's July 2008 90th birthday celebration fund raiser in Hyde Park. Through his love of cricket (he appeared on the cover of Time Out's cricket edition in August 2005 holding a cricket ball) Borrell has become friends with some of the English cricket team including former captain Andrew Flintoff who asked Razorlight to play at the inaugural night of his charity, The Andrew Flintoff Foundation (of which Borrell is a patron) in July 2009 at London's The Hurlingham Club. Borrell also played charity shows for Nordoff Robbins, and Save The Children in the latter part of 2009 and in September duetted on 'Je Suis Venue Te Dire Que Je M'en Vais' with legendary singer Jane Birkin as part of a fundraiser for Kenyan children's charity Anno's Africa. Borrell and The Libertines Borrell is one of \\"The Dalston Set\\", a clique of indie notables connected to the early days of The Libertines, along with Dominic Masters of The Others, Pete Doherty, Carl Barât, John Hassall, and the Queens of Noize. It has been reported that he was briefly a stand-in bassist for The Libertines before they were signed, but in recent interviews he has claimed that this is not true; however, in Pete Welsh's Kids in the Riot, it is alleged that Borrell was sacked as The Libertines' bassist for unreliable behaviour. In general though there is little animosity between the two bands, and Borrell remains friends with Carl Barât. The Libertines' song \\"The Boy Looked at Johnny\\" is reputedly about Borrell, and Razorlight's \\"Don't Go Back To Dalston\\" is reputedly directed at Pete Doherty, telling him to curtail his drug habit. Xfm Following his four-week residency on London radio broadcaster Xfm, Borrell joined the station for a further nine-week stint hosting a Sunday night show called The Sunday Service. It began on 6 September 2009 with Borrell playing a broad range of records spanning Jamaican dancehall, blues, rock'n’roll, krautrock and spoken word. Other work Borrell has appeared twice on The Mighty Boosh, once alone as a giant rapist rabbit in the 2006 stage show and once with Razorlight in the episode \\"The Priest and the Beast\\". Noel Fielding also opened for Razorlight at their two sold out Alexandra Palace shows in 2005 and appeared in the Razorlight video for the song 'In the Morning' and 'Up All Night'. Borrell appeared on the front cover of the May 2007 issue of Vogue magazine, alongside supermodel Natalia Vodianova, in his trademark skinny white jeans and topless. Borrell is one of only seven men who have appeared on the cover of the UK version of Vogue. In 2008 Borrell and bandmate Andy Burrows appeared at the Teenage Cancer Trust comedy night at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Borrell's friend Noel Fielding. The two played a short acoustic set. Late in 2007, Borrell played keyboards in a band he helped put together for Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine. The pair had met through Florence's manager Mairead Nash. Borrell went on to co-write and produced two songs with Welch, \\"The Hanging Song\\" and \\"Building Bricks\\" although these did not end up on Florence's debut album. It was reported that Borrell would star in an Irvine Welsh scripted film alongside Colin Firth and Robert Carlyle called 'The Meat Trade',The Meat Trade (2009) however the film did not make it into production. He has been approached with further film roles but has yet to commit to one. Borrell appeared on Never Mind The Buzzcocks in 2013, where host Jack Whitehall teased him about how Borrell used to date Whitehall's sister.

He played as a defender from 1985 until 2001. Ablett spent nine years with Liverpool, winning several honours, before moving to their city rivals Everton in 1992. He went on to win the FA Cup with Everton, having previously won an FA Cup in 1989 with Liverpool against Everton. He later played for Derby County, Hull City, Sheffield United, Birmingham City, Wycombe Wanderers, Blackpool and ended his playing career in the United States with the Long Island Rough Riders. He moved into coaching and managed Liverpool F.C. Reserves, and then spent a year as manager of Stockport County. Ablett died on 1 January 2012, following a 16-month battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at his home in Tarleton, Lancashire. He was 46 years old. Playing career =Liverpool= Ablett joined hometown club Liverpool as an apprentice upon leaving St Margaret's Church of England High School in 1982. He made his Liverpool debut on 20 December 1986 in a goalless league away draw with Charlton Athletic, when regular defenders Barry Venison and Mark Lawrenson were absent due to injury. He made five more appearances that season, scoring what would be his only goal for the club on 18 April 1987 in a 3–0 home league victory over Nottingham Forest. Alongside experienced players in defence, such as Gary Gillespie, Steve Nicol and skipper Alan Hansen, Ablett helped Liverpool win the League championship and reach the 1988 FA Cup Final. Ablett only collected a runners-up medal in the latter competition due to Liverpool's shock 1–0 defeat by Wimbledon. In 1988–89, Liverpool made it to their second consecutive FA Cup final. This time they were successful, after a 3–2 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton. They lost the League title, however, to Arsenal with practically the last kick of the season. Ablett was now firmly established as the club's regular left back, missing just three league games that season. Ablett flitted in and out of the squad over the next year, relegated in the pecking order following the arrival of Glenn Hysen and the progress of Steve Staunton and David Burrows. He was used more frequently as a central defender rather than left full-back after Hansen began suffering more with injuries. Eventually, he took the central role more often following the arrival of left back Burrows from West Bromwich Albion and won the League again with Liverpool in 1990. =Everton= Kenny Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager on 22 February 1991, and his successor, Graeme Souness, decided to sell Ablett for £750,000 to Everton in January 1992, after 147 appearances for the Reds. Ironically, his departure came at a time when he was getting more first team opportunities than he had done since the 1988–89 season. He made his league debut for the club on 19 January 1992 in a 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest at Goodison Park. Ablett won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, becoming the only player to win the competition with both Merseyside teams. However, he lost his place at left-back to Andy Hinchcliffe in the 1995–96 season, who had been moved back into defence after spending most of the previous season playing left midfield with Ablett behind him. =Later career= Ablett went on to make 128 league appearances and score five goals for Everton, and later went on to have a brief loan spell with Sheffield United before making a permanent move to Birmingham City for £390,000, joining them at the same time as established Premiership players Steve Bruce and Mike Newell, as new manager Trevor Francis set about building a side capable of challenging for a place in the Premier League. In three years with the Blues, he scored twice, with goals against Swindon Town in the league and Leeds United in the FA Cup. He was released by Birmingham City manager Trevor Francis in 1999, and after short spells with Blackpool (playing under former Anfield teammate Steve McMahon, scoring once against Luton Town) and Wycombe Wanderers, he signed for American A-League side Long Island Rough Riders in June 2000. In February 2002, at the age of 36, Ablett was taken on trial by Grimsby Town. In 2006, Ablett appeared as a substitute in Replay 86, a charity match staged in aid of The Marina Dalglish Appeal, which pitted the Liverpool and Everton sides that had contested the 1986 FA Cup Final against each other one more. Ablett's inclusion was curious, because although on Liverpool's books at the time of the Final, he did not actually make his debut for the club until the December of that year. Regardless, his contribution ensured Liverpool won the game 1–0. Coaching and managerial career In the summer of 2002, Ablett moved into coaching, taking up a post as the coach of Everton's under-17 side. He worked as part of the club's youth academy for several years until the summer of 2006, when he returned to his first club, taking the vacant job of Liverpool F.C. Reserves team coach, replacing Paco Herrera. The same career opportunities were not available at Everton with Andy Holden firmly established as reserve-team manager. In April 2008, under Ablett's guidance, Liverpool's reserves were crowned champions of the Premier Reserve League North, and the following month they became national champions after a play-off final victory against Aston Villa's reserves. In July 2008 he completed his final UEFA coaching qualification by obtaining the UEFA Pro Licence. Ablett's son, Fraser (born 1991), signed for Chester City and has since played for Colwyn Bay since the demise of Chester City. He currently plays for Widnes Vikings FC in the North West Counties Football League Division 1. On 28 May 2009, Liverpool announced that Ablett would be leaving his position as reserve team manager. On 8 July 2009, Ablett was announced as the new Stockport County manager. The club was in administration for the whole of the 2009–10 season, during which his team managed only five league wins. At the end of the season the club was relegated, 25 points adrift of safety. He left the club on 17 June 2010 when the 2015 Group took ownership of the club. Illness and death Ablett agreed to a one-year contract with Ipswich Town in July 2010 to join their coaching staff. After being taken ill on the training ground, he was diagnosed as suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of blood cancer. On 1 January 2012, 17 months after his diagnosis, Ablett died at the age of 46. His funeral was held at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral on 17 January 2012 and was attended by former teammates, as well as members of the teams and the then managers of Everton and Liverpool. Ablett's widow Jacqueline has supported calls for investigation into the hypothesis that artificial turf causes cancer.

Prior to receiving independent status, it served as the county seat of Chesterfield County, between 1870 and 1876. Today, it is a part of the city of Richmond, Virginia. Originally known as Manastoh and later Rocky Ridge, it was located on the south bank of the James River at the fall line opposite the state capital city of Richmond, on the north side of the river. Manchester was an active port city, and was a port of entry for slave ships principally in the 18th century. The port shipped out tobacco and coal which was transported 13 miles overland from the Midlothian-area mines on the Midlothian Turnpike, first paved toll road in Virginia in 1807, and the Chesterfield Railroad, the state's first in 1831. Manchester became an incorporated town in 1769 and an independent city in 1874. In 1910, it merged by mutual agreement with the larger state capital City of Richmond, achieving another \\"first\\" as the earliest of Virginia's independent cities to lose its identity. Today, \\"Old Manchester\\" is considered a neighborhood of Richmond. Many vestiges of its past are clearly visible, notably the courthouse, the Hull Street business district, a number of historic houses, and several former railroad and street railway buildings. As part of the community's African American heritage, a \\"slave trail\\" traces the route into the downtown area from where the slave ships docked along the river. Interstate 95, and four other major highways, U.S. Routes 1, 60, 301 and 360 all cross the James River and enter downtown Richmond from Manchester. Rocky Ridge, seaport, mills, and railroads As a result of the Second Anglo-Powhatan War, in 1645 the Virginia Colony's House of Burgesses provided for Fort Charles to be built and garrisoned at the Falls of the James, to protect the frontier. After two years, Fort Charles was relocated to the south side, to the high ground above the later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Bridge, on a tract owned by Capt. Thomas Harris. This land was then still known by its native name, Manastoh, but was thereafter renamed Rocky Ridge by the English.Francis Earl Lutz, 1954, Chesterfield: An Old Virginia County, p. 49. Rocky Ridge in 1769 became an incorporated town on Chesterfield County, with the name of Manchester. Manchester grew to become a major seaport in the 17th through 19th centuries, as did its neighbor Richmond on the north bank of the river. Both were located at the head of navigation of the tidal James River at the geological fall line. Above that point, the river consists of seven miles of rapids before becoming more navigable again west of Richmond, although much shallower. Before the American Revolutionary War, tobacco industries made the town their home. It was also known as a major slave market. Manchester was commercially successful primarily due to its agricultural mills and docks. From northwestern Chesterfield County, coal from the Midlothian area 13 miles west was transported to the docks at Manchester, first on the Manchester Turnpike, a toll road and Virginia's first graveled road of any length completed in 1807. Later, beginning in 1831, the congested turnpike was supplemented by the gravity and mule-powered Chesterfield Railroad, the first railroad in Virginia, partially engineered and funded by the Virginia Board of Public Works. For its final several miles, the line followed present-day Maury Street, which was the southern border of Manchester for many years. It crossed over the steam-powered Richmond and Petersburg Railroad (later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) tracks (now abandoned) on a high trestle between what is now Clopton Street and Jefferson Davis Highway. When the new Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&D;) was completed between Manchester and Coalfield Station (now Midlothian) in 1851, the older Chesterfield Railroad was unable to compete and portions were acquired by the R&D;, with the remainder dismantled before the Civil War took place. County seat of Chesterfield County During Reconstruction, Manchester was briefly the county seat of Chesterfield County, from 1870 until 1876. County voters approved the move from Chesterfield Court House, Virginia, and the cornerstone of the new courthouse was laid on March 31, 1871.Lutz, p. 277 It was designed by Richmond-based architect A.L. West. The former courthouse complex on Hull Street is now the Manchester Division of the Richmond City courts. Manchester became an independent city in 1874, and was therefore no longer technically located in Chesterfield County. In the election that year, county voters were again asked if they wished to relocate the county seat elsewhere, but rejected a move following a heated campaign, by a vote of 1,442 to 388. However, when the question of a move came up once again on the 1876 ballot, voters approved, 1290 to 772, a return to Chesterfield Courthouse, which became effective on July 1 that year.Lutz, p. 282 Manchester agrees to consolidate with Richmond For over 250 years, the James River divided Richmond on the north bank from its sister, Manchester, located on the south bank. A major issue for Manchester and Richmond residents in the 19th and early 20th century were the toll ferries and toll bridges over the James River. The latter were subject to frequent destruction by ice floes and flooding on the river. There were periodic talks and negotiations for over 35 years between the cities before, in 1910, Manchester agreed to a political consolidation with the much larger independent City of Richmond. Richmond's better-known name was used for both areas as it contained the location of Virginia's state capital. Two of the key features of the consolidation agreement were requirements that a free bridge across the James River be built and that the separate courthouse in Manchester be maintained indefinitely. Instead of being a barrier between neighboring cities, under the consolidation, the James River became the centerpiece of the expanded Richmond. Today, Manchester is recognized as a historic district in state and national registers. Although Manchester is extinct as an independent city, vestiges can be found in the Manchester Bridge, Manchester Slave Trail, and the Manchester Courthouse. Manchester and other areas of the City of Richmond south of the James River are locally referred to as \\"South Richmond\\", \\"South Side Richmond\\" or simply \\"South Side.\\" Manchester as neighborhood: industry Though part of the city of Richmond, Manchester's industrial presence continued to flourish in the 20th century. Manchester was serviced by Hull Street Station on the Southern Railway, built in 1901, the only major urban depot on the southern side of the James River. The skyline is dominated by the Southern States silos, the tallest structures south of the River. Cooperative Manchester as neighborhood: Residential and Commercial The Manchester Residential and Commercial Historic District is located in the city of Richmond, Virginia, on the south side of the James River. It is connected to the financial district in Richmond by the Lee, Mayo and Manchester bridges. In the 1800s, Manchester along with Richmond, had become a major port and commercial center serving the eastern seaboard and beyond. Manchester was granted city status in 1874 and became the seat of Chesterfield County. In 1910, the city of Richmond annexed Manchester.

At Li's request, Jiang quickly transported that wealth outside the Nanjing area, planning to meet back up with Li later. Jiang delivered on his promise to accompany the transport with 20 horses and an ox, but Li was captured and executed before he could rendezvous with Jiang. Jiang was left with wealth that he was able to bring back to Nanjing after the war. =Writing= Loyal Prince Li Xiucheng In His Own Words (《忠王李秀成自述》) is his autobiographical account written shortly before his execution.  Li's sword  When Li withdrew from Suzhou, his sword - the symbol of his power - was given to his young brother Li Shixian. Li Shixian took this sword; however it was confiscated when he was captured by Charles George Gordon in Liyang. When Charles George Gordon returned to the UK with Li's sword, he presented it to Queen Victoria's cousin, Chief Commander of the Military the Duke of Cambridge. On 30 August 1961, the sword ended up in the hands of a history professor at the University of London. In 1981, this sword was returned to China where it is currently stored in the National Museum of China. Children Li Xiucheng had a son Li Ronfar, and three daughters, whose husbands were Taiping generals (including Tan Shaoguang and Chen Binwen).

It is located on the grounds of the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. The school is housed in the Choctaw Route Station, a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad station built in 1899. Former Senator and Governor David Pryor was named as the school's first dean. He stepped down from his position as dean in February 2006 but retained the title and active position of Founding Dean. Skip Rutherford was appointed to succeed David Pryor (Rutherford's mentor) when he was named dean on April 12, 2006.  Master of Public Service Program  The Clinton School is a graduate school offering its students a Master of Public Service degree. The program is described as a \\"two-year graduate program with a 'real world' curriculum.\\" The mission of the school is \\"to educate and prepare individuals for public service, incorporating a strategic vision, an authentic voice, and a commitment to the common good.\\" The program is unique within the presidential schools for its emphasis on practical courses, which include a practicum, summer internship, and capstone project. The school is further unique for its emphasis on leadership for social change, preparing students to become leaders in the public, private, and non-profit sectors, as well as its emphasis on creating bridges among those sectors. The Clinton School emphasizes equity, as opposed to emphasizing efficiency in public administration schools and effectiveness in public policy schools.  Public programs and publications  The Clinton School of Public Service building The Clinton School releases a biannual publication called Frank: Academics for the Real World. The fall/winter 2007 inaugural issue of Frank was entitled “Has the Dream Arrived?” and focused on race relations in America. It included pieces by David Eisenhower, President Bill Clinton, Carlotta Walls Lanier, Karl Rove, The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Richard Dawkins, Simon Cowell, Eboo Patel, Aneesh Raman, and Antonio Villaraigosa. =Speaker series = Since 2004, the Clinton School hosts free public programs, guest lectures and community conversations featuring a wide range of internationally-prominent leaders and timely topics. Some notable speakers have included Henry Kissinger, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Karl Rove, Alan Keyes, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, John McCain, and Richard Dawkins. The series also screens films and documentaries and hosts panel discussions for every Arkansas Repertory Theatre production. Since its inaugural lecture from U.S. Senator Bob Dole, the school has hosted over one thousand events, including nine presidents and prime ministers, two Supreme Court justices, 22 Pulitzer Prize winners, 13 U.S. senators, 41 ambassadors, four Oscar winners, two astronauts and four NFL players, among others All programs are free and open to the public, though more notable speakers sometimes requires advanced ticketing. The format of the speakers vary widely, and the school has made its public forums with Charles Ogletree, Judge Robert Carter, and John Edwards available to the Arkansas Educational Television Network, or AETN. Most of the series is recorded and available to the public from the Clinton School's website. In addition to the speaker series, the Clinton School has teamed with the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Kumpuris family to establish a distinguished lecture series at the Clinton Presidential Center. The Kumpuris Lecture Series inaugural address on August 7, 2007 was given by President Clinton. Other guest lecturers include James Baker, Sam Waterston, and Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai.  Enrollment  The Clinton School admitted 16 students from around the globe in its inaugural class in 2005. Since then, the school has increased admission to about 50 students and has a current enrollment of about 90 students. The enrollment pattern is in keeping with the two other presidential schools that are coupled with presidential libraries. By comparison, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs started in 1970 with 18 students and now has 312; the George Bush School of Government and Public Service began in 1997 with 19 students and now has 125. Students who are enrolled in the Clinton School are encouraged to continue public service acts throughout the world. Many participants come from public service backgrounds and already have experience in the field. Some programs Clinton School students come from include the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and some have military and medical backgrounds.

It is also a part of the MacArthur Park Historic District, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Built between 1840 and 1841, it was part of Little Rock's first U.S. military installation. Since decommissioning, the building has housed two local museums. It was home to the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities from 1942 to 1997 and the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History since 2001. It has also housed the Little Rock Æsthetic Club since 1894. The building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower. Besides being the last remaining structure of the original U.S. military installation and one of the oldest buildings in central Arkansas, it was also the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur, who became the supreme commander of U.S. forces in the South Pacific during World War II. It was also the starting place of the Camden Expedition during the American Civil War. History Nineteenth Infantry, 1866 =Background= The building and the surrounding park were used for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century. The Tower Building served as headquarters for the United Confederate Veterans Reunion, May 15–18, 1911. Over 106,000 Civil War veterans, the largest popular gathering in the history of the city up to that time, attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park, which had also become a popular camping area. Later the building served as an armory for the Arkansas National Guard. In 1912, the second floor of the Tower Building became Little Rock's first public library. In 1917, Little Rock built a fire station in the park. A band shell named for H. H. Foster also was built in the park during this time, but no longer exists. In 1936, Works Progress Administration built the Museum of Fine Arts, now called the Arkansas Arts Center, just south of the Tower Building. The arsenal was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Due to its association with the Camden Expedition of 1864, the arsenal may be included in the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark designated in 1994. and In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due to the efforts of the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It became the new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum remained in the tower building for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the Tower Building had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due to the efforts of Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur. In 1997, the Museum of Science and Natural History merged with the Little Rock Children's Museum, which had been located in Union Station, to form the Arkansas Museum of Discovery. The new museum was relocated to a historic building in the Little Rock River Market District. The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History opened on May 19, 2001 in the Tower Building. The new museum's goal is to educate and inform visitors about the military history of Arkansas, preserve the Tower Building, honor servicemen and servicewomen of the United States and commemorate the birthplace of Douglas MacArthur. =Construction= The arsenal was constructed at the request of Governor James S. Conway in response to the perceived dangers of frontier life and fears of the many Native Americans who were passing through the state on their way to the newly established Indian Territory. Thirty-six acres were appropriated on the outskirts of Little Rock by Major Robert B. Lee of the U.S. Army. The land had been previously used as a racetrack by the local jockey club. John Wormley Walker, a builder for the Federal Government, supervised the construction. Originally $14,000 was allocated for the construction of the arsenal, but proved inadequate. The budget was later increased to $30,000. Work began on the Tower Building in 1840, and it was the first permanent structure of the arsenal to be built. Being originally constructed to store ammunition, the building was designed with exterior walls. The original plans called for it to be built of stone, however, masonry was used instead. The Arkansas Gazette referred to the structure as \\"A splendid specimen of masonry\\". =American Civil War= Henry M. Rector, governor from 1860 to 1862alt=Photograph of Henry M. Rector For several years the arsenal, which was owned by the federal government, served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers. But in November 1860, with the American Civil War on the horizon, a company of the Second United States Artillery, consisting of sixty-five men, was transferred to Little Rock under the command of Captain James Totten. On January 15, 1861, the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention. It was planned for February 18; however, events at the arsenal, would not wait. On January 28, then Governor Henry M. Rector informed Captain Totten that he and his soldiers would be \\"permitted to remain in the possession of the Federal officers until the State, by authority of the people, shall have determined to sever their connection with the General Government,\\" Totten responded to this by telling the Governor that his orders came from the United States Government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements, although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming. The first telegraph wire to span between Little Rock and Memphis had recently been completed. Local attorney John M. Harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from Arkansas's capital. In his message, Harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the Little Rock Arsenal. > The United States troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the > state and in the Indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters > to reinforce the garrison at Fort Smith. The garrison at Fort Smith had been > previously transferred to the United States Arsenal in this city (Little > Rock). The arsenal is one of the richest depositories of military stores in > the United States and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the > tropps[sic]ordered from the frontier. > :::-John M. Harrel Telegram, January 31, 1861 The item was intended simply as a piece of news, but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state, fueling procession sentiment. The rumor was interpreted by some Arkansans as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal. By February 5, six militia units, consisting of 1,000 men, with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5,000 if the situations deemed it necessary, had assembled in Little Rock. Governor Rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops. Faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of Little Rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops, Governor Rector was forced to take control of the situation. On February 6, he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to Captain Totten, > This movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this > State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the > Arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities, in order to > their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed > such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to > interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of > the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in > the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and > munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held > subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next. Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President, Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops. He agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions: # The governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the United States. # The soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war. # The soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders, not as conquered and surrendering soldiers. On the morning of February 8, 1861, Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials. That afternoon, the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head. All of the federal troops had left at this point, except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor's speech and to hand the arsenal over in person. The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in 1860 as an \\"arsenal of deposit,\\" meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis. Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs, nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands. Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board. Inside the Little Rock Arsenal after its seizure in February, 1861, the Confederates inventoried some 10,247 weapons, 250,000 musket cartridges, and 520,000 percussion caps, as well as the four bronze cannon of Totten's battery. Long arms in the Arsenal's inventory consisted of: :M1822 .69 cal (flintlock) 5,625 :M1822 .69 cal (percussion-converted) 53 :M1842 .69 cal smoothbore (percussion) 357 :M1855 .58 cal rifle-muskets 900 :M1817 common rifles 125 :M1841 rifle (\\"Mississippi Rifle\\") 54 :M1847 musketoon 2 :Hall's carbines 267 :Hall's rifles (flintlock) 2,864 ::Total 10,247 Of this number, approximately 9600 weapons were serviceable, or ready-for-issue. Note there were only 1,364 percussion weapons available. Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy, but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, mustered in June, 1861, were issued M1816/M1822 .69 caliber flintlocks. The 9th and 10th Arkansas, four companies of Kelly's 9th Arkansas Battalion, and the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment were issued flintlock Hall's Rifles. The units comprising the infantry force of Van Dorn's Army of the West were the 1st and 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles were also armed with M1822 flintlocks from the Little Rock Arsenal. By the time the 11th and 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiments mustered in at Little Rock, the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted, and only old \\"junker\\" weapons were left. Most of the equipment, arms, and machinery at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to east of the Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862, and accountability for it is lost at that point. By all appearances, the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, and from there to Jackson Mississippi, where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863. Major General Thomas C. Hindman, sent to command the district of Arkansas in May, 1862, found the state nearly destitute of military material. Hindman established another armory at Arkadelphia, and revived the Little Rock Arsenal as a collection point and depot for armaments and ammunition manufacture for small arms. Hindman recorded: \\"Machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms, and both were turned out in small quantity, but of excellent quality. Lead mines were opened and worked, and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the Ordnance Department and in the manufacture of calomel, castor oil, spirits of nitre, the various tinctures of iron, and other valuable medicines. Most of these works were located at or near Arkadelphia on the Ouachita River, 75 miles south from Little Rock. The tools, machinery, and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor. Nothing of this sort had been before attempted on Government account in Arkansas to my knowledge, except for the manufacture of small arms, the machinery for which was taken away by General Van Dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings� A further supply, along with lead and caps, was procured from the citizens of Little Rock and vicinity by donation, purchases, and impressments. This ammunition, and that which I brought with me, was rapidly prepared for use at the Laboratory established at the Little Rock Arsenal for that purpose. As illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country, the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the State Library for cartridge paper. Gunsmiths were employed or conscripted, tools purchased or impressed, and the repair of the damaged guns I brought with me and about an equal number found at Little Rock commenced at once. But, after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men I decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against Fitch and that I would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to Gen'l Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from Little Rock instead of pikes and lances, with which most of them were armed. Two days elapsed before the change could be effected.\\" The Confederate ordnance establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August, 1862. Looking around for a suitable person to head this activity, General Hindman turned to the Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington. Lt. Dunnington was the commander of the gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain, which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad. Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock, and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department, he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities (which included artillery functions) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Lt. Col. Dunnington's \\"Returns for the month of August, 1862, at Little Rock Arsenal, C.S.A.,\\" are found in Vol. 149, Chapter IV of the \\"Captured Rebel Ordnance Records,\\" and are most enlightening as to the scope of Confederate ordnance activities at Little Rock during this crucial time. According to Dunnington, \\"When I assumed command at this Post, all material had been removed to Arkadelphia. There were no persons employed. No shops were open for repair of arms or for fabricating ammunition. Material, tools, etc., had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers. Work commenced the last part of the month.\\" The military force at Little Rock under Dunnington's command consisted of four officers: himself, Major John B. Lockman, Captain C.C. Green, and 2nd Lt. W.W. Murphy. In addition to these, he had 20 enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a foreman, 2 clerks, 3 gunsmiths for repairing small arms, a laboratorian, 26 laborers in the ammunition laboratory, and a carpenter for making packing boxes. During the month of August, 1862, the following work was performed: \\"Fabricated: one pair of musket bullet moulds; 10,000 buck & ball shot cartridges; repaired: 750 muskets, shotguns, and rifles; received and repaired: ordnance stores and ordnances; performed: guard, office, and police duties; inspected: Posts at Camden and Arkadelphia.\\" Lt. Col. Dunnington continued to build up his works at Little Rock until November 1862, when Captain Sanford C. Faulkner (composer of The Arkansas Traveler) was placed in charge of the Arsenal. Dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the Ponchartrain. A \\"Summary of the Work Done for November, 1862, Little Rock Arsenal\\" shows: Fabrication: :75,000 buck & ball cartridges - percussion :14,000 buck & ball cartridges - flint :275 paper fuzes :117 rounds, 6-pounder canister shot :130 rounds, 6-pounder ball shot :96 ammunition packing boxes Repaired: :2,236 shotguns and rifles (repaired mostly for troops in service) :23 pistols (repaired mostly for troops in service) Received & Issued: :752 packages of ordnance and ordnance stores received and mostly issued to troops in service. Repaired and painted: :4 gun carriages Performed: :Guard, office, and police duties. Perhaps the most illuminating points of the above \\"Summary of Work\\" and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was .\\"buck & ball\\", indicating that the .69 caliber smoothbores and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use, and of this, nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons, indicating that no less than a sixth of the Confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons. The \\"Summaries of Work done at Little Rock Arsenal, C.S.A.\\" continue at about the same pace and scale from August 1862 until August 1863. Appended to the \\"Summary\\" for August, 1863 is the ominous notation, \\"During the last week in the month, nearly all stores at the Arsenal have been packed and sent to Arkadelphia, in obedience to orders from Chief of Ordnance, District of Arkansas.\\" This then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from Little Rock, with the city being surrendered to the advancing Federal troops of Frederick Steele's Arkansas Expedition on September 11, 1863. In 1864, after Little Rock fell to the Union Army and the arsenal had been recaptured, General Fredrick Steele marched 8,500 troops from the arsenal beginning the Camden Expedition. =Brooks- Baxter War= In 1874, the arsenal was briefly seized once more by Joseph Brooks loyalists. =Decommissioning= In 1873, the arsenal was renamed Little Rock Barracks and the main building used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had been added to the building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there. In the 1880s, the federal government began closing many small arsenals around the country in favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment. The arsenal commander received word from Washington that the Little Rock site must be abandoned \\"not later than October 1, 1890.\\" On April 12, 1893 the tower building and the surrounding buildings were traded to the city of Little Rock for 1,000 acres (4 km²) in Big Rock Mountain on the north side of the Arkansas River, present day North Little Rock, under the condition that the building and land be \\"forever exclusively devoted to the uses and purposes of a public park.\\" That site later became Fort Logan H. Roots. All of the original buildings surrounding the Tower Building were demolished. =Æsthetic Club= In 1894 the Little Rock Æsthetic Club, one of the oldest women's societies west of the Mississippi River, moved into the Tower Building. This was prompted due to increased membership and a need for larger, more permanent quarters. The previous year, club members working with women's organizations throughout the state, raised money to furnish the Arkansas Building of the Columbian Exposition at The Chicago World's Fair. At the fair's conclusion, artifacts from the exhibit were displayed in the Tower Building, with the Æsthetic Club invited to meet in the \\"Columbian Room.\\" Except for Æsthetic Club meetings, the Tower Building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration. The Æsthetic Club provided much- needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the Great Depression. The Æsthetic Club is still headquartered in the Tower Building. See also * Battle of Bayou Fourche * Capital Guards Memorial * David O.

Fay Jones, and constructed in 1980. The design recalls the Prairie School of architecture popularized by Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom Jones had apprenticed. The chapel was commissioned by Jim Reed, a retired schoolteacher, who had purchased the land in 1971 and envisioned a non-denominational pilgrimage chapel set apart in the landscape for meditation. The design of Thorncrown Chapel was inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle, a Gothic church in Paris, France containing many windows and different types of glass to allow more light into the structure. The chapel was selected for the 2006 Twenty- five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, a status not granted to buildings fewer than fifty years old unless exceptionally significant.\\"How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation,\\" (PDF), National Register Bulletins, National Park Service, 6. Accessed 2009-12-06. It was included in Budget Travel's list of \\"12 Most Beautiful Churches in America\\" and Bored Panda's list of \\"50 Most Extraordinary Churches Of The World.\\" Structure and status Interior The chapel stands 48 feet (14.6 meters) high, 24 feet (7.3 meters) wide, and 60 feet (18.3 meters) long. It has 425 windows and over 6,000 square feet (560 square meters) of clear glass. During the design process, Jones decided that in order to preserve the site's natural setting, no structural element could be larger than what two men could carry through the woods. Thus, larger elements of the building, such as the upward diamond- shaped trusses, were assembled on the floor and raised into place. The structure was constructed using organic materials indigenous to northwestern Arkansas including pressure-treated Southern pine and flagstone for the floor and surrounding wall. All of the wood was hand-rubbed with a grayish stain to blend with the bark of the surrounding trees and stone. The small ornamental roof skylight was later enlarged to provide additional natural lighting throughout the chapel. The chapel looks like an open-air structure, but is, in fact, an enclosed air-conditioned space that seats up to 100 people. It is open daily from March to December with free admission, and is closed January and February except for weddings and other special events. Non-denominational church services are held in the adjoining worship center on Sundays from April to December. See also * Mildred B.

She is best known for her 1995 dance cover version of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", which reached the US and UK Top 5, and for representing the United Kingdom in the 2000 Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm. Career French was born in Carlisle, Cumbria, England. She provided backing vocals on Rose-Marie's 1992 album, Emotional Exposure. Generally, French had been a session singer for many years before she covered \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", a song originally made famous by Bonnie Tyler. French's single was first released in 1994 in the United Kingdom. When it was re-released in 1995, the song reached number 5 during a three-month chart run in the UK Singles Chart, selling over 250,000 (UK) copies in the process and earning a silver sales award. The single achieved greater success in the United States, where it reached number 2, spending six months on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and gained Gold certification from the RIAA. The single also reached number 1 in a number of countries – Japan, Canada, Spain and Brazil – as well as charting in Australia, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. French sold in excess of 5 million copies. Her second single \\"For All We Know\\", a cover version of The Carpenters' song, only reached number 42 in the UK Singles Chart, hindered by poor distribution and a barcode error. The track was due to be released in the US but due to a dispute between record companies only made it as far as a promo release in America. Her debut album, Secrets, charted in Japan, Brazil, Israel, Canada, Australia and the United States (selling 50,000 copies during its first week on sale). Further singles from the album included \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\", \\"Did You Ever Really Love Me?\\" (the latter of which reached number 55 in the UK) and \\"Never in a Million Years\\" (which was released in Denmark and Sweden only). \\"Did You Ever Really Love Me?\\" was also released Stateside. Various other songs were added to formats around the world, including renditions of \\"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\\" and \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\". French was her record label's biggest artist but due to them achieving limited success with their other acts they went into liquidation. French was then signed by Logic Records UK (part of the Sony/BMG group), during which time she released \\"Te Amo\\" in various countries. In Brazil it reached number 4 becoming French's fifth consecutive Top 10 in the airplay charts. It was stocked by HMV in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1997 but failed to reach the UK Singles Chart. Another single from this album was due for release, \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\\", but it only ever made it to various compilations. In 1998, she released her second album, entitled \\"French Revolution\\" and had success in Japan and Taiwan but was eventually dropped by her record label after management reconstructing. In 2000, she entered the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Don't Play That Song Again\\", the song being selected by the British public ahead of seven other finalists on radio and TV. She was then signed up by RCA and the track entered at number 34 in the UK chart. French finished the contest in 16th place, at the time the lowest placing for any UK act. French signed to Jim Steinman's Ravenous Records label for a short period in 2000, during which time she recorded \\"Lovers Again\\" and \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" neither of which were ever commercially released. She later went on to record three tracks with the writer of her Eurovision hit, John Springate. These were dance and reggae covers of previous Eurovision entries, French herself chose not to release them but still occasionally performs her versions at Eurovision events. In 2003, French was one of nine contestants on a special Eurovision edition of BBC Television's The Weakest Link. Joining Sonia, Lyn Paul, James Fox, Katie Boyle, Bobby Gee, Jessica Garlick, Katrina Leskanich and Jemini on the show hosted by Anne Robinson, French won the event and was declared 'The Strongest Link' raising £13,000 for Cancer Research, having lost her father to cancer in 1997. In fact, French had been a last minute substitute for original guest, Gina G, who had to drop out of the show when she went into labour. She still has a strong relationship with Eurovision and its fans, and is booked each year to co-host the London Eurovision Party with Paddy O’Connell. In 2003 she was the only British artist to feature in an ABC Television special in LA; ‘The Disco Ball – a 30-Year Celebration’, filmed at the Shrine Auditorium, also starring among others - Gloria Gaynor, Whoopi Goldberg, KC & the Sunshine Band, Chic, Irene Cara, and Usher. French continues to tour the United Kingdom and Europe, performing her hits as well as new material. She released two singles, \\"I Surrender\\" in 2004 and \\"Calling Out My Name\\" in 2005. \\"I Surrender\\" charted on the EuroNRG Top 40 chart in February 2005. However, her later release, billed as 'Diva DJs Vs Nicki French', \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart 2006\\" did not appear in the UK Singles Chart. French has retained her large gay following, and has headlined some of the biggest Pride shows in recent years including EuroPride, Stockholm Pride and the world's biggest Pride event Australia's Mardi Gras. In 2007 French was invited back to Brazil, one of her most successful territories, to perform a show for the radio station Energia 97FM. The tickets sold out quickly, and another show was booked for the preceding evening. Since then, French has been invited back to Brazil regularly to perform shows. In 2009 a special edition of French's second album French Revolution became available. The CD contained seventeen tracks and included all three of her most recent singles along with a previously unreleased version of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\". The same year, she released \\"No Smoke\\", which did not enter the UK charts. French regularly worked on tracks with Energise Records, and was always their main artist. She often provided backing vocals for their other artists, as well as lead & backing on her own. In early 2015 Energise released a four-CD album of songs they had recorded with French over the previous years, ‘One Step Further’, which is their biggest-selling album to date. In 2014, 20 years after the success of ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart’, Mike Stock and French have started working together again, recording new tracks for his label Modal Production Group (MPG Ltd). The first release from the studio is the anthemic dance number, ‘This Love’: according to Stock himself ‘the song’s message is a celebration of love and commitment’. In 2017 French performed at the first ever Isle of Wight Pride, in Ryde. Theatre In recent years, French has managed to combine her acting, as well as her singing skills. In 2007 she was cast as understudy for the original London cast of \\"Menopause the Musical\\", starring Su Pollard. She was subsequently part of all the UK and Irish productions, and has played three out of the four roles throughout her connection with the show, elevating to being cast in the main roles. From August 2010 she toured the UK in the hit Annie, performing eight different roles every night in the show's long run, and was understudy for the role of Miss Hannigan, played by Su Pollard. In April 2012, French was the first person to play the roles of Dora and Sarah, in a brand new comedy ‘Guilty Pleasures’ by Ron Aldridge, which opened at the Pavilion Theatre in Bournemouth, but the premise of a men's brothel covering as a spa didn't go down well, and the show closed at the same venue, despite being booked for a UK tour. French then created the role of Sarah in Pauline Fleming's comedy ‘Dirty Dating.Com’, which premiered at the Stockport Plaza Theatre and the Epstein Theatre, Liverpool, and in October played Helga ten Dorp in Ira Levin's ‘Deathtrap’ at the Brookside Theatre, Romford. In 2013, French was honoured to be given responsibility for bringing Ethel Merman to life in a new two-hander play, ‘Gee, But It’s Good to be Here – An Audience With Ethel Merman’, written by Steve Burbridge. It premiered at the Trent House, Newcastle upon Tyne, and French spent many hours watching clips of Merman speaking and singing in order to do the part justice. It worked, as she received great reviews for the piece. Pantomime French took on her first pantomime in 2008, playing Queen Genevieve in ‘Sleeping Beauty’ (Chipping Norton Theatre). The pantomime gained great reviews, making it into the top 10 pantomimes in the UK in The Daily Telegraph newspaper. In 2009 she was Fairy Godmother in ‘Cinderella’ (The Brindley, Runcorn), for New Pantomime Productions, alongside Syd Little, Leah Bracknell, Aiden J Harvey and Hayley Clarke. She was working on the tour of ‘Annie’ in 2010, but in 2011 went back to panto, playing Dandini in ‘Cinderella’ (Lighthouse Theatre, Kettering) with Danny Young and Neil & Christine Hamilton, and for the 2012 Christmas season played Fairy Sparkle in ‘Cinderella’ (Princess Theatre, Torquay) with Steven Arnold, Stuart Wade and Tom Owen, again for NPP. In 2013 she was cast as Queen Charlotte in an Easter production of ‘Sleeping Beauty’ for Enchanted Entertainment, alongside Peter Duncan, and at Christmas played her first ‘baddie’ role of Wicked Stepmother Queen in ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ for Paul Holman Productions at the Palace Theatre, Newark, with Bernie Clifton. In 2014, French she worked again for Paul Holman, playing Witch Guillotine in ‘Beauty and the Beast’ at Oakengates, Telford, alongside Matt Evers. In the 2015 panto season she will be at the Pomegranate Theatre, Chesterfield, playing the Wicked Queen again. In 2016, she played the Ice Queen in another Paul Holman production of Santa Claus The Musical at the New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, alongside Mark Read from A1 and Jason Sutton. Personal life French was born in Carlisle to Joseph and Eileen. She has two sisters, Allison and Carolyn, and a brother, Timothy, who is a songwriter. The French family moved when Nicki was four and settled in Tenterden, Kent. She attended Homewood School and West Kent College in Tonbridge. French married Gavin Mallett, a professional musician, in July 1993 at St. Mildred's Church, Tenterden. The couple lived in Middlesex. They are now divorced.

Three glucose units in maltotriose are connected by an α-1,4 glycosidic bond, whereas consecutive maltotriose units are connected to each other by an α-1,6 glycosidic bond. Pullulan is produced from starch by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. Pullulan is mainly used by the cell to resist desiccation and predation. The presence of this polysaccharide also facilitates diffusion of molecules both into and out of the cell. As an edible, mostly tasteless polymer, the chief commercial use of pullulan is in the manufacture of edible films that are used in various breath freshener or oral hygiene products such as Listerine Cool Mint of Johnson and Johnson (USA) and Meltz Super Thin Mints of Avery Bio-Tech Private Ltd.

It describes itself as a conservative, Confessional Lutheran body. The ELS has 130 congregations and has missions in Peru, Chile, India, South Korea, Ukraine, Czech Republic, and Latvia. The ELS is in fellowship with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) and is a member of the international Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC). Core beliefs The Evangelical Lutheran Synod teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative and error-free source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord) not in-so-far- as but because it is an accurate presentation of what scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification. Membership In 2010, the ELS had an estimated number of 19,394 baptized members The ELS also has 130 congregations and missions in Peru, Chile, India, South Korea, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Latvia. The current president is John Moldstad, who has been serving since 2002. Note that the ELS uses the term synod differently from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and is a separate denomination. History Herman Amberg Preus, (1825–1894), a key figure in organizing the Norwegian Synod. The Evangelical Lutheran Synod traces its history back to 1853 when the \\"Norwegian Synod\\" was organized in the Midwestern United States. They practiced \\"fellowship\\", a form of full communion, with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) during the 1850s and 1860s. In 1872, they along with the LCMS and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) formed the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America. In 1917, the Norwegian Synod merged with two other Norwegian Lutheran groups and formed the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, later named the Evangelical Lutheran Church. This led to disagreement among members of the Norwegian Synod. The people who became the ELS had concerns regarding fellowship with those who did not share the same doctrine. The Norwegian Synod had taught that conversion and salvation were entirely the work of God without any cooperation from humans. The new merged church allowed that conversion depended in some degree on humans accepting God's grace. A group of people therefore gathered at Lime Creek Lutheran Church near Lake Mills, Iowa, on June 14, 1918, and reorganized as the Norwegian Synod of the American Evangelical Lutheran Church (also known as \\"Little Norwegian\\" Synod) The name was later changed to the Evangelical Lutheran Synod on June 25, 1957. In 1955 the ELS suspended its fellowship with the LCMS over doctrinal disagreements, and in 1963 it withdrew from the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America. It retained its fellowship with the WELS. (The WELS severed its fellowship relations with the LCMS in 1961, and also withdrew from the Synodical Conference in 1963.) In 1993, the ELS and WELS, working with a number of other worldwide Lutheran churches, some of which had been founded through mission work by both synods, founded the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC). The ELS published a hymnal, the Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary, in 1996. ELS presidents *Bjug Harstad (1917–1922) *George Gullixson (1923–1926) *Christian Anderson (1926–1930) *Helge M.

In 1946, it established its own seminary, also in Mankato, called Bethany Lutheran Theological Seminary. Throughout its history, ELS congregations have actively sponsored Christian elementary schools. The synod carries on an active home mission program and now has 130 congregations in many states. It also has foreign missionaries laboring in Peru and Chile in South America and in Ukraine, Latvia, and the Czech Republic in Eastern Europe.

The complex was designed by Henn GmbH. It features a museum, feature pavilions for the principal automobile brands in the Volkswagen Group, a customer centre where customers can pick up new cars, and take a tour through the enormous factory, a guide to the evolution of roads, and cinema in a large sphere. History The idea for Autostadt was started in 1994 when the concept of documenting the stages of production of Volkswagen vehicles and how the company's operations were showcased at Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. In 1998, Autostadt, which is German for \\"Car City\\", broke ground on the former site of a fuel company bordering Volkswagen's Wolfsburg production plant. Like the adjacent car plant, the site of Autostadt is on the north bank of the Mittelland Canal. The resulting complex is the work of more than 400 architects, created as a new urban center, close to downtown Wolfsburg. The main pavilion opened in May 2000, providing an opportunity to present famous cars hitherto locked in crates to be shown to the public. By that time it was reported that Volkswagen had invested approximately 850 Million Marks (€435 Million) in the project. Autostadt is located next to Volkswagen's main factory which is also an attraction. Every Volkswagen model is available giving the opportunity for the public to choose what they want. Volkswagen then manufactures the car specified according to the purchaser's requirements. Visitors and attractions Glass car silo Autostadt attracts around 2 million visitors a year. It is very popular because of the ultra modern architecture it features in each building. Extensive use is made of water and vegetation between the pavilions and mounds of earth covered in grass are located in the grounds. Modern design is not just incorporated into the pavilions but also into the furniture such as benches and chairs. It has a small track for the off-road Volkswagen Touareg underneath the bridge which leads from the main town to the Autostadt which is located above the main canal cutting through the city, the Mittelland Canal. Visitors must be able to show driving licences before being able to drive the vehicles. First, the guide drives the car around the track showing the features of the vehicle and giving information of the vehicle's capabilities. After driving around the track, the visitor can then drive around the track under the surveillance of the guide who sits in the passenger seat. Any other passengers sit in the back. Features of the track include a 21 degree angled hill, another hill which is angled on the side, a water tank, a sand pit which is located under a road bridge, a log road and a numerous small mounds which allow one wheel to be raised off the ground. There is a mini track for children where they can drive small electric cars in the form of Volkswagen Beetles. Autostadt has a large variety of multimedia activities and devices which include car design software. There is a room exhibiting the advantages and disadvantages different fuels have on the performance of cars. There are two cinemas which show small films in German. One of these cinemas is located in its own purpose built buildings and is in a large sphere. Major attractions are some famous cars, such as the first petrol vehicle produced, and the Beetle. Inside the glass car silos There are two 60 meter/200 ft tall glass silos (AutoTürme) used as storage for new Volkswagens. The two towers are connected to the Volkswagen factory by a 700-metre tunnel. When cars arrive at the towers they are carried up at a speed of 1.5 metres per second. The render for the Autostadt shows 6 towers. When purchasing a car from Volkswagen (the main brand only, not the sub-brands) in select European countries, it is optional if the customer wants it delivered to the dealership where it was bought or if the customer wants to travel to Autostadt to pick it up. If the latter is chosen, the Autostadt supplies the customer with free entrance, meal tickets and a variety of events building up to the point where the customer can follow on screen as the automatic elevator picks up the selected car in one of the silos. The car is then transported out to the customer without having driven a single meter, and the odometer is thus on \\"0\\". There is also a room with interactive devices which provide information on the design of cars using Audi as an example. Computer software allows visitors to design their own cars using features from Audi cars. Pavilions at Autostadt There are seven pavilions dedicated to car manufacturers at Autostadt. =Volkswagen production and development= There are two pavilions for Volkswagen which show production and the development of cars. The Volkswagen development pavilion is the largest in ground area of all pavilions at Autostadt. The pavilion is circular in shape and has two floors which display all models in the Volkswagen range plus a shop of Volkswagen articles of clothing, die cast models and vehicle accessories which is located on the top floor. The production pavilion is the smallest and one of the last of the pavilions to be constructed. It was not included on the original render of Autostadt. =Porsche= The Porsche pavilion. The Porsche pavilion is circular-shaped, the interior design is simple yet elegant. The visitors enter on a descending curved corridor entering the only hall of the pavilion. There are three models on display, a Boxster, a 911 and a Panamera. Behind them there are small models of the previous cars in the history of the marque with the oldest displayed with the smallest and the generation just before the current one the biggest in scale. Next to the cars on display, there is a black couch fitted with iPads running an app which shows the history of Porsche with pictures and videos on the former generations. =Premium Clubhouse (formerly Bentley)= The pavilion is built into a small hill. It has a marble roof and the entrance is cut into the side of the grass-covered mound. The exit is on the opposite side of the pavilion. It was designed by KSS Architects. The pavilion visit began with an escalator with a film either side documenting cars produced by Bentley since the creation of the company. There was then a spiralling walkway which descends around a rotating displays of cogs illuminated by coloured lights which changed throughout. Television screens of varying sizes were located around this contraption which showed different videos of their vehicle's performance. The Bentley pavilion was renamed in 2008, now being shared with the Bugatti brand and renamed the \\"Premium Clubhouse\\". The displays include a Bugatti Veyron with a special chrome finish and separately an engine from the same car model. =Škoda= The Škoda pavilion consists of a number of metal sculptures. It shows several examples of cars produced under the Škoda brand and small models of all types ever produced in Škoda's history. Like in other brand pavilions it is possible to open and enter the cars to get a feeling for them. Information about engine specifications, prices and fuel consumption are next to each car. =Lamborghini= The Lamborghini pavilion. On the other side is a circular platform which rotates during the show inside and a Murcielago appears on the outside. The building is completely black and a show with an orange Lamborghini Aventador attached to the wall greets visitors. During the show, the lights dim and dry ice floods the room before finally diminishing revealing that the car has disappeared from the wall. During this, the car which sits on a vertical platform has been rotated 180 degrees and sits on the outside of the building. =Audi= The building is large and has a unique \\"sphere-guide\\". Each visitor gets a small plastic sphere which they first have to activate by giving their name and taking a photo with the help of wall-mounted touchscreens at the entrance. Then through the way in the pavilion, the sphere lights up with the same color as the design of the current section and visitors can push their spheres onto special hemisphere depressions on the wall thus for example launching a video about some technical information on the wall mounted displays, light up a real Audi headlight placed behind a piece of glass in the wall or creating an illusion of charging an electric A1 by floor-mounted lights. Visitors can get into the vehicles on display including an R8. At the end of the tour visitors can send their photo made at the entrance in e-mail or post it to social networking sites after dropping the sphere in the collecting pit. =SEAT= The SEAT pavilion with the entrance bridge. The exit bridge is on the other side. The SEAT pavilion is surrounded by water and plants and is one of the largest pavilions. A metal archway is located at the entrance to the bridge which leads to the entrance of the building. The roof of the entrance is glass and the wall to the right is composed solely of red wing mirrors. There is a display of the fourth generation of the SEAT Ibiza in a glass case. The platform it sits on rotates. The next room then comprises all current SEAT models on display. A staircase leads up to a mezzanine level with numerous computer screens and iPads with playable racing games. This finally leads to an exit which comprises a wooden based bridge on metal tubes. This bridge is interactive; the tubes contain speakers which play back the Seat 'castanet' SFX with each footstep across the bridge.

A common variation has the free leg lifted toward the back, typically in an attitude position, with the arms held above the body, or with a catchfoot position (haircutter spin). A common, though very difficult, variation is the Biellmann spin. History The spin was invented by Cecilia Colledge of Great Britain. Technique The layback spin used as an iconic image to represent figure skating. The iconic layback position is one in which the torso is bent backwards, the free leg lifted, and the arms extended above the torso, bent in an approximation of a circle. This creates a unique impression during the spin. This position has become iconic of figure skating, showing up in logos and banners promoting figure skating events, including the Olympic Games. A layback spin can also be performed with the torso leaning more towards the side, in which case it is known as a side layback or sideways-leaning spin. Both backwards and sideways-leaning positions in a layback spin are considered a feature that adds difficulty under the ISU Judging System. Variations Other variations of the layback spin include ones where the free leg is gradually lowered so that it finally almost touches the ice. If it is performed in a manner that causes the spin to accelerate, it is considered a feature that adds difficulty. Various hand and arm positions are included to create individuality and artistry in the spin, including one and two-handed leg grabs, known to the judging panel as \\"haircutter\\" spins. The layback can also be performed to the side, which, if held long enough, can be considered a difficulty variation and adds to the level. Adding a Biellmann position to a layback spin is also considered a feature that adds difficulty. It is possible to perform a back layback spin and a change layback spin, however due to the difficulty both are rare. Another variation is the flying layback, that is, a layback spin that is entered through a jump. Differing techniques exist for the air position, but all require the skater to leap up into the air with an arch in the back and the free leg held to the side and the skating leg tucked like a flying sit. Since it is a same-foot flying spin, it requires fewer difficult features to attain a high level. The flying layback spin is rarely performed because of the physical danger posed by landing with a hyperextended spine and the fact that few coaches know how the move is performed. However, some skaters such as Choi Ji Eun have been successfully credited with flying layback spins in competition.ISU Junior Grand Prix SBC Cup Ladies Free Skating Protocol In competition In competitive figure skating, the layback or sideways-leaning spin is a required element for ladies in the short program. Few male skaters perform this spin because it is not a required element at any level of men's competition. In addition, most males lack the back flexibility required by the position (a problem that is known to plague some female skaters as well). Male skaters known to perform the layback in competition include Rohene Ward, and it is often referred to as a signature element for Adam Rippon. The spin is usually taught initially as the attitude spin, with only the leg behind in an attitude position. Once the skater can balance in that position, which is rather awkward at first, the skaters begin practicing the spin with an arch. In the ISU Judging System, the layback spin is valued higher than other single position spins of the same nature (e.g. change of foot, flying entrance).ISU Communication No. 1396 Gallery =In single skating= Image:Angela Nikodinov 2.jpgAttitude layback spin (Angela Nikodinov) Image:Alissa Czisny Layback.jpgAttitude layback spin (clockwise spinner) (Alissa Czisny) Image:Rachael Flatt Spin 2009 World Team Trophy.jpgAttitude layback spin (Rachael Flatt) Image:Mirai Nagasu at the 2010 Olympics (2).jpgAttitude layback spin (Mirai Nagasu) Image:Yukina Ota 2003 NHK Trophy.jpgView from the front (Yukina Ota) Image:Wagner 2009 WJC Layback spin.jpgView from the back (clockwise spinner) (Ashley Wagner) Image:Kim 2010 Worlds Gala.jpgView from the side (Yuna Kim) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C1114-0008-003, Jutta Will.jpgSideways layback spin Image:Rohene Ward Layback.jpgA man performs layback spin (Rohene Ward) Image:Catch foot layback.jpgCatch-foot layback spin (Jelena Glebova) Image:Mirai Nagasu Spin 2007 JGP USA.jpgCatch-foot layback spin (Mirai Nagasu) Image:Caroline zhang grand prix 2007 lp 1.jpgCatch-foot \\"pearl\\" layback spin (Caroline Zhang) Image:Alexandra Ievleva 2005 Croatia Cup.jpgCatch-foot layback spin (Alexandra Ievleva) Image:Elena Liashenko 2003 NHK Trophy.jpgArm variation (Elena Liashenko) Image:Fleur Maxwell Spin 2004 Junior Grand Prix Germany.jpgLeg variation (Fleur Maxwell) Image:Diane Szmiett Spin 2008-2009 JGPF.jpg\\"Haircutter\\" variation (Diane Szmiett) Image:Haircutter spin.jpg\\"Haircutter\\" variation (Angela Maxwell) =In pairs= Image:Lubov Iliushechkina & Nodari Maisuradze Spin 2009 Europeans.jpgPair Upright spin & Catch-foot \\"pearl\\" layback spin (Nodari Maisuradze & Lubov Iliushechkina) Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-U1215-0046, Sabine Baeß, Tassilo Thierbach.jpgPair layback spin & sit spin (Sabine Baeß & Tassilo Thierbach) References Figure skating elements ","title":"Layback spin"},{"id":"1216416","text":"Athos ([ˈæθɒs] Greek: , ), in Greek mythology, was one of the Gigantes.

Oil on canvas. 12 ft 1 in x 16 ft 3 in. Louvre. Lantern slide given the title \\"Sardanapalus\\" by William Henry Goodyear. (Original of image unknown). Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection Sardanapalus (; sometimes spelled Sardanapallus) was, according to the Greek writer Ctesias, the last king of Assyria, although in fact Ashur-uballit II (612–605 BC) holds that distinction. Ctesias' book Persica is lost, but we know of its contents by later compilations and from the work of Diodorus (II.27). In this account, Sardanapalus, supposed to have lived in the 7th century BC, is portrayed as a decadent figure who spends his life in self-indulgence and dies in an orgy of destruction. The legendary decadence of Sardanapalus later became a theme in literature and art, especially in the Romantic era. The name Sardanapalus is probably a corruption of Ashurbanipal, an Assyrian emperor, but Sardanapalus as described by Diodorus bears little relationship with what is known of that king, who in fact was a militarily powerful, highly efficient and scholarly ruler, presiding over the largest empire the world had yet seen. Story according to Diodorus Diodorus says that Sardanapalus, son of Anakyndaraxes, exceeded all previous rulers in sloth and luxury. He spent his whole life in self- indulgence. He dressed in women's clothes and wore make-up. He had many concubines, female and male. He wrote his own epitaph, which stated that physical gratification is the only purpose of life. His lifestyle caused dissatisfaction within the Assyrian empire, allowing a conspiracy against him to develop led by \\"Arbaces\\". An alliance of Medes, Persians and Babylonians challenged the Assyrians. Sardanapalus stirred himself to action and routed the rebels several times in battle, but failed to crush them. Believing he had defeated the rebels, Sardanapalus returned to his decadent lifestyle, ordering sacrifices and celebrations. But the rebels were reinforced by new troops from Bactria. Sardanapalus's troops were surprised during their partying, and were routed. Sardanapalus returned to Nineveh to defend his capital, while his army was placed under the command of his brother-in-law, who was soon defeated and killed. Having sent his family to safety, Sardanapalus prepared to hold Nineveh. He managed to withstand a long siege, but eventually heavy rains caused the Tigris to overflow, leading to the collapse of one of the defensive walls. To avoid falling into the hands of his enemies, Sardanapalus had a huge funeral pyre created for himself on which were piled \\"all his gold, silver and royal apparel\\". He had his eunuchs and concubines boxed in inside the pyre, burning himself and them to death.The historical library of Diodorus the Sicilian: in fifteen books. To which are added the fragments of Diodorus, and those published by H. Valesius, I. Rhodomannus, and F. Ursinus, Volume 1, p. 118-23 Historical authenticity There is no king named Sardanapalus attested in the Assyrian King List. Parts of the story of Sardanapalus seem to be related in some degree to events in the later years of the Assyrian Empire, involving conflict between the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal and his brother Shamash-shum-ukin, who controlled Babylon as a vassal territory, on behalf of his brother. While Sardanapalus has been identified with Ashurbanipal, his alleged death in the flames of his palace is closer to that of his brother Shamash-shum-ukin, who became infused with Babylonian nationalism and formed an alliance of Babylonians, Chaldeans, Elamites, Arabs and Suteans against his master in an attempt to transfer the seat of the vast empire from Nineveh to Babylon. There is no evidence from Mesopotamia that either Ashurbanipal or Shamash-shum-ukin led hedonistic lifestyles, were homosexual or transvestites. Both appear to have been strong, disciplined, serious and ambitious rulers, and Ashurbanipal was known to be a literate and scholarly king with an interest in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, history, zoology and botany.Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq It was Shamash-shum-ukin in Babylon who was besieged and defeated, and his allies crushed, not Ashurbanipal in Nineveh. After the former's defeat in 648 BC, an inscription of Ashurbanipal's records that \\"they threw down Shamash-shum-ukkin, enemy brother who attacked me, into the raging conflagration\\".Sarah Melville, tr., in Mark William Chavalas, ed. The Ancient Near East: historical sources in translation 2006:366: The actual Fall of Nineveh occurred in 612 BC after Assyria had been greatly weakened by a bitter series of internal civil wars between rival claimants to the throne. Its former subjects took advantage of these events and freed themselves from the Assyrian yoke. Assyria was attacked in 616 BC by allied forces of Medes, Scythians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Persians, Cimmerians and Elamites. Nineveh was besieged and sacked in 612 BC. Ashurbanipal's son Sin-shar-ishkun (the third of four kings to rule after Ashurbanipal) was then ruling as king of Assyria. He was probably killed defending his city in the sack, though records are fragmentary. Ashur-uballit II succeeded him as the last king of an independent Assyria, ruling from Harran, the last capital of Assyria until 605 BC. Assyria survived as an occupied province and geo-political entity until it was dissolved after the Arab Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century AD. The area is still inhabited by a now Christian and still Eastern Aramaic-speaking indigenous Assyrian minority today. Recently Sardanapalus has been identified with Ashur da’in apla, the son of Shalmaneser III, who led a rebellion against his father.Emmet John Sweeney, Empire of Thebes, Or, Ages in Chaos Revisited, Algora Publishing, New York (2006), , pp. 130ff.]. Alleged tomb On the eve of the battle of Issus (333 BC), Alexander's biographers say, Alexander the Great was shown what purported to be the tomb of Sardanapalus at Anchialus in Cilicia, with a relief carving of the king clapping his hands over his head and an inscription that the locals translated for him as \\"Sardanapalus, son of Anakyndaraxes, built Anchialus and Tarsus in a single day; stranger, eat, drink and make love, as other human things are not worth this\\" (signifying the clap of the hands).Robin Lane Fox, Alexander the Great (1973) 1986:163, noting Aristobulus and Calisthenes Historically, there is no record of any Assyrian king dying or being buried in Cilicia. In art and literature In the introductory pages of Book I of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, those who (erroneously, according to Aristotle) equate the good life with the life of brute pleasure are likened to Sardanapalus. The death of Sardanapalus was the subject of a Romantic period painting by the 19th-century French painter Eugène Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus, which was itself based on the 1821 play Sardanapalus by Byron, which in turn was based on Diodorus. In Act 4 of Goethe's Faust II, Faust responds with the exclamation \\"Sardanapalus!\\" to Mephistopheles' guess of what it is that Faust strives after. Mephistopheles offers up the life of pleasure as Faust's life's goal. E. H. Coleridge, in his notes on the works of Byron, states, \\"It is hardly necessary to remind the modern reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an unverifiable personage... The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided capture by suicide, cannot be identified\\". Sardanapalus is a hero in The Fall of Nineveh by Edwin Atherstone. He is portrayed as criminal who ordered one hundred prisoners of war to be executed and burned his palace with all his concubines inside. Hector Berlioz, the 19th-century French Romantic composer, wrote a very early cantata, Sardanapale on the subject of the death of Sardanapalus. It was his fourth and finally successful attempt in the Prix de Rome competition, run by the Paris Conservatoire. Only a fragment of the score survives. Franz Liszt began an (uncompleted) opera on the subject, Sardanapalo. Henry David Thoreau, writes in Walden, \\"It is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd so diligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon discovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a Sardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely emasculated.\\" In A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens describes the French Court, and by extension the French Monarchy and upper class: \\"It had never been a good eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride, Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness...\\" In Dante's Paradiso, XV.107-108, \\"Sardanapalus had not yet come to show to what use bedrooms can be put.\\" (That is, society had not reached such extremes of decadence.)

Life He was born in Brabant around 1440, but information about his early life is scanty. He probably received his early training in Flanders, as did most of the composers of his generation. Sometime before 1473 he became associated with the ducal chapel in Ferrara, Italy, where Ercole I d'Este was attempting to build a musical establishment on the part of some of the other aristocratic centers in Italy. He was a member of the famous Milan chapel of the Sforza family in July 1474, along with Loyset Compère, Gaspar van Weerbeke, and some of the other composers from northern Europe who were part of the first wave of Franco-Flemish influence in Italy. In November he returned to Ferrara. What prompted him to leave and return is not known, but since the Milanese chapel was then the most renowned in Europe, it is possible he went to investigate the competition for his employer as much as to improve his own singing and compositional skill. However he must have returned to Milan, since he is listed along with Jean Japart, Colinet de Lannoy, and Compère, to be given a safe pass for exit from Milan on 6 February 1477, following the 1476 assassination of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza.Fitch, Grove online Martini was well-rewarded by his employer, receiving not only an unusually large salary for his position in the chapel, but his own house in Ferrara. In 1486 he traveled to Hungary as part of the group from Ferrara involved in the installation of a d'Este as Archbishop of Esztergom, and in 1487 and 1488 he made two separate trips to Rome to negotiate the benefices given to him by Duke Ercole. Music and influence Martini wrote masses, motets, psalms, hymns, and some secular songs, including chansons. His style is conservative, sometimes referring back to the music of the Burgundian School, especially in the masses. Some stylistic similarity to Obrecht suggests that the two may have known each other, or at the very least Martini may have seen Obrecht's music. Obrecht was a guest in Ferrara in 1487, and his music is known to have circulated in Italy in the early 1480s. Some of the earliest examples of the paraphrase mass are by Martini. His Missa domenicalis and Missa ferialis, which have been tentatively dated to the 1470s at the earliest, use paraphrase technique in the tenor voice – the normal voice for carrying the cantus firmus – but also include the same melodic material in other voices at the start of points of imitation. The paraphrase technique was to become one of the predominant methods of mass composition in the early 16th century.Burkholder, Grove In addition to his mostly conservative output of masses, he is the first composer known to have set psalms for double choir singing antiphonally. This style, which was to become famous in Venice under the direction of Adrian Willaert seventy years later, seems to have had no influence at the time: yet it was a striking innovation. His secular music is in both French and Italian. References and further reading *Article \\"Johannes Martini\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie. 20 vol.

The ANC system was created in 1974 through a District referendum (73 percent voted \\"yes\\") in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. The first elections for Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners were held in the fall of 1975, and commissions began operating in 1976. Congressman Don Fraser (D-Minn) and DC resident Milton Kotler helped to draft the ANC language in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act based on the success of Adams Morgan Organization (AMO) in Adams Morgan and on a 1970 report of the Minneapolis Citizen League, as well as on related neighborhood corporations in Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio. ANCs consider a wide range of policies and programs affecting their neighborhoods, including traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the District's annual budget. Commissioners serve two-year terms and receive no salary, but commissions do receive funds for the general purpose of improving their area and hiring staff. This policy has come under scrutiny because of the misuse of funds by commissioners and their employees. Candidates can accept campaign donations up to $25 per person. Powers The powers of the ANC system are enumerated by the DC Code § 1-207.38: # May advise the District government on matters of public policy including decisions regarding planning, streets, recreation, social services programs, health, safety, and sanitation in that neighborhood commission area; # May employ staff and expend, for public purposes within its neighborhood commission area, public funds and other funds donated to it; and # Shall have such other powers and duties as may be provided by act of the Council. The ANCs present their positions and recommendations on issues to various District government agencies, the Executive Branch, and the Council. They also present testimony to independent agencies, boards, and commissions, usually under the rules of procedure specific to those entities. By law, the ANCs may present their positions to Federal agencies. One of the most common cases of ANC involvement is in the giving of liquor licenses, where the approval or disapproval of the commission, despite having no legal power, represents a veto to the district government. Membership and qualifications Each ANC Commissioner is nominated and elected by the registered voters who reside in the same Single Member District as the candidate. The ANC Commissioner is an official representing his or her neighborhood community (Single Member District) on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission. In order to hold the office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, an individual must be a registered voter (or must be able to register to vote within two years) in the District, as defined by DC Code Section 1-1001.02; have resided continuously in the Single Member District from which he is nominated for the 60-day period immediately preceding the day on which the nominating petition is filed; and hold no other public office. In order to enter the public ballot, they must receive 25 signatures from registered voters in their district. Single Member Districts The District of Columbia is divided into 8 wards, each of which is further divided into local ANCs. The basic area of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions are Single Member Districts. There are 299 Single Member Districts, which in turn are subdivisions of 39 'Commission Districts', which are in turn subdivisions of Wards. Each Commissioner represents about 2,000 residents in their Single Member District (SMD) area.

(originally known as Kensonic Laboratory, Inc.) is a Japanese, Yokohama-based high-end audio equipment manufacturer founded by former Kenwood engineer Jiro Kasuga in late 1972. Kasuga was not happy with the views of Kenwood relating to the follower of their High-End Supreme 1 unit (1967). He hired some engineers from other prominent brands (Marantz, Luxman) and started Kensonic, with Kenwood as a part owner. Some other connections in the early years of Accuphase exist as well. If you compare the parts used by Kenwood and Kensonic throughout the latter's early years, the familiarities show quite easy: knobs, buttons, tuner dials and the general direction of the design. Accuphase's early PCBs are tagged KENSONIC, too, and the early units bore KENSONIC on their frontplates as well. Until the mid-1990s, Kenwood still owned part of Kensonic. It appears that Accuphase engineers may have had a hand in the engineering of Kenwood's last high-end series (L-A1, L-D1 and LVD-Z1). For example, the Accuphase E-405 and Kenwood L-A1 have very similar volume knobs, side panels, and remotes. Kensonic's first products were the P-300 amp(lifier), the C-200 preamp, and the T-100 tuner. The E-202 integrated amp and an up-versioned tuner (the T-101) were added soon after. All received very positive reviews in 1973 and 1974. While Kenwood has now abandoned all high-end audio activities, Kensonic carries on with the Accuphase series. Accuphase products are well regarded by high-end audio enthusiasts, but the brand is uncommon in the USA. Accuphase products are readily identified by their large Champagne-colored faceplates and large dual analog power meters – which are similar to the respected McIntosh Laboratory brand (McIntosh is famous for its unique faceplates, which are made of silk-screened glass and use large blue analog power meters). Accuphase explains the brand name as follows: > The name ACCUPHASE was adapted by taking the prefix ACCU from the word > \\"accurate\\", and combining it with PHASE which is a most important factor in > audio technology.....it is a very fitting brand name to describe our > products that fully portray this and other important characteristics, which > penetrate the innermost depth of audio technology. Source: Accuphase website Accuphase has a good reputation for quality, with units from the first series still in use. Models remain available at least for several years, and sometimes up to a decade.

This red eyed creature is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Perciformes and can be distinguished from other similar species by the six spines in the anal fin (other sunfish have only three anal fin spines).http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_18958-45688--,00.html Distribution Rock bass Rock bass are native to the St Lawrence River and Great Lakes system, the upper and middle Mississippi River basin in North America from Québec to Saskatchewan in the north down to Missouri and Arkansas, south to the Savannah River, and throughout the eastern U.S. from New York through Kentucky and Tennessee to the northern portions of Alabama and Georgia and Florida in the south. The rock bass has also been found in the Nueces River system in Texas Bergman, R. 1942. Fresh Water Bass. New York: Penn Publishing Corp. Description They are similar in appearance to smallmouth bass, but are usually quite a bit smaller. Identifying characteristics of rock bass are their two dorsal fins that have spinous and soft-rayed united portions, a large mouth, six anal spines, red eyes; rows of dark dots on their sides. The mouth of a rock bass is located in the terminal position, below the snout, with small conical teeth to eat prey. The average rock bass is between 6 and 10 in, and they rarely weigh over a pound. Few rock bass live beyond 10 to 12 years. A. rupestris, the largest and most common of the Ambloplites species, has reached a maximum recorded length of 43 cm (17 in), and a maximum recorded weight of 1.4 kg (3.0 lb).IGFA World Record - All- Tackle Record - Rock Bass (Ambloplites rupestris) It can live as long as 10 years. These fish have body coloring from golden brown to olive with a white to silver colored belly and have the ability to rapidly change their color to match their surroundings. This chameleon-like trait allows them to thrive throughout their wide range.http://www.discoverboating.com/resources/article.aspx?id=516 Habitat Rock bass prefer clear, rocky, and vegetated stream pools and lake margins. Rocky banks of northeastern lakes and reservoirs are a common habitat for rock bass. Their favorite habitat contains some vegetation with rocky bottoms and cool to warm waters. Rock bass species are usually found near rocky shorelines. They can be surprisingly unflustered by the presence of human activity, living under lakeside docks and near swimming areas. Rock bass are frequently seen in groups, particularly near other sunfish. Diet Large bass, northern pike, muskie, and walleye prey on young rock bass. Rock bass compete with smallmouth bass for food. It is carnivorous, and its diet consists of smaller fish, including their own young at times, yellow perch, and minnows, as well as insects, and crustaceans. Rock bass are occasionally known to take food from the surface. Adult Rock bass may eat heavily, particularly in the evening and early in the morning. Conservation Rock bass are successfully surviving in their environments and are listed as a species of \\"least concern\\" on the IUCN red list. Based on their population stability, rock bass do not require any special monitoring or conservation management plans. As a sport fish, Rock bass are managed to some extent by regulations. There are slot limits for rock bass on some bodies of water. Also, nursery/artificial ponds are types of management to maintain Rock bass populations.http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ambloplites_rupestris/ Reproduction Rock bass are sexually mature at about 2 to 3 years of age. Rock bass are polygynandrous, in which both females and males have multiple mates during the breeding season. Spawning occurs from April to early June in warm waters ranging from 12 to 15 degrees Celsius, with females laying from 2,000 to 11,000 eggs. Like other members of the sunfish family, the male will dig a nest near the lake shallows, and will aggressively guard it. A spawning area may be heavily used, with several other rock bass nests very close together.Gross, M., W. Nowell. 1980. The reproductive biology of rock bass, Ambloplites rupestris (Centrarchidae), in Lake Opinicon, Ontario. Copeia, 1980/3: 482-494. As a result, males can become quite aggressive as they attempt to defend territory and attract and hold females. Rock bass lack courtship displays, so the female enters the nest and joins the male in his circular behavior. Both the female and male simultaneously release their sperm and eggs into the nest. The male guards and fans the eggs, and later raises the young for a short time. Rock bass are known to grow quickly.  Relationship with humans  Rock bass are considered game fish throughout much of their range, the IGFA all tackle world record for the species is a tie between 1.36kg (3lb) fish caught in Ontario, Canada and Pennsylvania, USA in 1974 and 1988 respectively.  Misconceptions  Ambloplites constellatus (Ozark bass), a species of rock bass from the Ozark upland of Arkansas, and Ambloplites ariommus (shadow bass) are true rock bass, but regarded as separate species. Ambloplites rupestris is sometimes called the redeye or redeye bass in Canada, but this name refers more properly to Micropterus coosae, a distinct species of centrarchid native to parts of the American South. Rafinesque originally assigned the rock bass to Bodianus, a genus of marine wrasses (family Labridae).

He was Prime Minister of South Korea from 29 February 2008 to 28 September 2009, and was the President of the 56th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, in 2001 and 2002. Education Han received his bachelor's degree from Yonsei University in 1960. He acquired his master's degree from Seoul National University in 1963, and his doctorate in economics from University of York in 1968. He went on to hold various professorial positions in the United Kingdom and South Korea. Political and diplomatic career He was first elected to the National Assembly in 1988. He was ambassador to the United States from 1993 to 1994, chief presidential secretary to President Kim Young Sam from 1994 to 1995, and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister from 1996 to 1997. In April 2001, Han was appointed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea. He was elected the President of the fifty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2001. After his term in the United Nations, he re- entered politics and was elected into the Korean National Assembly in 2002. Before the elections, he left the posts of Chairman of the UN General Assembly and Foreign Minister. In 2004, he was honored as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. After Lee Myung-bak won the December 2007 presidential election, he nominated Han as Prime Minister in late January 2008. Han's nomination was approved by the National Assembly on 29 February 2008, with 270 votes in favor and 94 opposed. The United Democratic Party, which considered Han to be unsuitable, caused the vote to be delayed from the initially planned date of 25 February, but it eventually decided not to oppose Han's nomination after the withdrawal of three other ministerial nominations that it opposed.Kim Sue-young, \\"Assembly Endorses Han as Prime Minister\\", The Korea Times, 29 February 2008.

Easton and Bradford Parkinson) with the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). He was the co-leader (the other being Louis Ridenour) of the research group which developed the SCR-584, an automatic microwave tracking fire- control system, which enabled anti-aircraft guns to destroy a significant percentage of the German V-1 flying bombs launched against London late in the Second World War. Biography and positions held Ivan A. Getting was born on 18 January 1912 in New York City to family of Slovak-German immigrants from Bytča, Slovakia and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an Edison Scholar (S.B. Physics, 1933); and Merton College, Oxford as a Graduate Rhodes Scholar (D.Phil., 1935) in astrophysics. He then worked at Harvard University on nuclear instrumentation and cosmic rays (Junior Fellow, 1935-1940) and the MIT Radiation Laboratory (1940-1950; Director of the Division on Fire Control and Army Radar, Associate Professor 1945; Professor 1946). During the Second World War he was a special consultant to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson on the Army's use of radar. He also served as head of the Naval Fire Control Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, member of the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee on Searchlight and Fire Control, and head of the Radar Panel of the Research and Development Board of the Department of Defense. In 1950, during the Korean War, Getting became Assistant for Development Planning, Deputy Chief of Staff, United States Air Force; and in 1951, Vice President for Engineering and Research at the Raytheon Corporation (1951-1960). While at Raytheon, Getting also served on the Undersea Warfare Committee of the National Research Council. In 1960 Getting became the founding President of The Aerospace Corporation (1960-1977). The Corporation was established at the request of the Secretary of the Air Force as a non- profit organization to apply \\"the full resources of modern science and technology to the problem of achieving those continued advances in ballistic missiles and space systems, which are basic to national security.\\" Getting was also a founding member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Group (later renamed the Scientific Advisory Board) and chair of its Electronics Panel. Getting retired from The Aerospace Corporation in 1977. In 1978 he served as President of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Northrop Corporation and the Board of Trustees of the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan. Getting died on October 11, 2003, in Coronado, California. Major technical and administrative contributions While at MIT Radiation Laboratory, Getting's group developed the first automatic microwave tracking fire control radar, the SCR 584. This system, along with the proximity fuze, significantly reduced damage to London by the V-1 flying bombs (also known as \\"doodlebugs\\" or \\"buzz bombs\\") launched by Germany from June 1944 of the Second World War, by enabling accurate anti-aircraft fire to destroy the missiles. On 28 August 1944, the last day on which significant numbers of V-1s were launched against London, of 104 fired, 68 were destroyed by artillery, 16 by other means, and 16 crashed . Getting was an early designer and proponent of satellite-based navigation systems which led to the development and deployment of the Global Positioning System (GPS). While in Raytheon he oversaw the development of the first three-dimensional, time-difference-of-arrival position-finding system – developed in response to an Air Force requirement for a guidance system to be used with a proposed Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) that would achieve mobility by traveling on a railroad system. While at The Aerospace Corporation he oversaw studies on the use of satellites as the basis for a navigation system for vehicles moving rapidly in three dimensions. In addition to his technical contributions to GPS, Getting was a tireless advocate of the project in the face of early resistance from the Pentagon. He was also involved in the development of the first high-speed flip-flop circuit at Harvard. He also was involved in the development of the Navy GFCS MK-56 anti- aircraft fire control system; as well as in the development and building of a 350 MeV synchrotron at MIT Radiation Laboratory. He also was involved in the development of the Sparrow III and Hawk missile systems; as well as commercial production of transistors at Raytheon. As a consultant to the US government: implementation of the Quick Reaction Capability for Electronic Counter- Measures; establishment of the SHAPE Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Laboratory at the Hague; deployment of U.S. air defense capability called the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system; direction of studies on MX missile basing and long-range combat aircraft; technical analysis and design of a long-range supersonic bomber capable of reaching the former Soviet Union and returning without refueling (Getting's work is credited in the reinstatement of the B-1 bomber funding by the U.S. Congress). As member of the Undersea Warfare Committee of the National Research Council: Associate Director of Project Nobska sponsored by the U.S. Navy and concerning submarine warfare weapons; recommended a submarine-based, solid-propellant intermediate- range ballistic missile that formed the basis for the Polaris missile.

She was the mother of King Leopold III of Belgium and of Queen Marie-José of Italy, and grandmother of kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium, and Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg. Family Born in Possenhofen Castle, her father was Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria, head of a cadet branch of the Bavarian royal family, and an ophthalmologist. She was named after her father's sister, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, better known as Sisi. Her mother was Maria Josepha of Portugal, daughter of exiled Miguel I of Portugal. Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Zita, the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, and Felix of Bourbon-Parma, husband of Grand Duchess Charlotte and brother of Empress Zita, were among Elisabeth's first cousins. An artist himself, Duke Karl-Theodor cultivated the artistic tastes of his family and Elisabeth was raised with a deep love for painting, music and sculpture. At her father's clinic, where her mother assisted her father as a nurse, Elisabeth obtained exposure to productive labour and to human suffering unusual at that time for a princess. Married life and queenship Albert & Elisabeth 1924 on the obverse of a military bronze medalAlbert Queen Mary of the United Kingdom and Queen Elisabeth Elisabeth and the royal children are featured in this 1909 newspaper compilation. In Munich on 2 October 1900, Duchess Elisabeth married Prince Albert, second-in-line to the throne of Belgium (after his father Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders). Upon her husband's accession to the Belgian throne in 1909, Elisabeth became queen. The city of Élisabethville, today Lubumbashi, in the Congo was named in her honour. They had first met in 1897 at the funeral of Elisabeth's aunt Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria, who was also the mother-in-law of Albert's sister Henriette. At the time, Prince Albert was the heir to his uncle Leopold II of Belgium. Albert was the second son of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a sister of King Carol I of Romania. At birth, Albert occupied the third place in the line of succession behind his father and elder brother, Prince Baudouin. The unexpected death of Baudouin in January 1891 immediately raised Albert to prominence within his country. A studious, quiet man, Albert was not the choice of heir that King Leopold II would have relished. As the only living male member of his generation, Albert was guaranteed the Crown of the Belgians upon the King's death. Albert had two sisters who survived into adulthood, Princess Henriette who married Prince Emmanuel of Orléans, and Princess Joséphine Caroline who married her cousin, Prince Karl-Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, brother of King Ferdinand I of Romania. In December 1909, Albert and Elisabeth became King and Queen of the Belgians, following the death of Albert’s uncle, King Leopold II. The new Queen took on a much more public role than her predecessors, getting involved with many charities and organizations, particularly those in the arts and social welfare. She often surrounded herself with famous authors and artists, as well as leading scientists of the day. Her friendly nature, and true care and concern for others, quickly endeared her to the people of Belgium. When war broke out in 1914, Queen Elisabeth worked with the nurses on the front and helped establish the Symphony Orchestra of the field army. She also travelled to the UK often, under the pretext of visiting her children who were studying there. She was often bringing important messages and information to the British government from her husband and his forces. Following the war, the family made a triumphant return to Brussels and set about to rebuild the nation. During the First World War, she and the King resided in De Panne. The Queen made herself beloved by visiting the front lines and by sponsoring a nursing unit. Despite her German background, she was a popular queen, perceived as eagerly supporting her adoptive country. From September 23 to 13 November 1919, the Queen, together with the King and Prince Léopold, undertook an official visit to the United States of America. During a journey in the historic pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico, the King awarded the Order of Léopold to Father Anton Docher.Keleher and Chant. The Padre of Isleta. Sunstone Press, 2009, p. 94. As a memento, the King was given a turquoise cross mounted in silver made by the Tiwa people.W.A. Keleher.

The Queen (in a white dress) and the King during their visit in Isleta pueblo New Mexico 1919 with Anton Docher Later years On February 17, 1934, Albert I died in a mountain climbing accident in the Ardennes of Belgium, near Namur. He was succeeded by their elder son, King Leopold III. Elisabeth withdrew from public life, so as not to hinder the efforts of her daughter-in-law, now Queen Astrid. However, in August 1935, Queen Astrid was killed in a car crash in Küssnacht am Rigi, Switzerland. Queen Elisabeth returned to the public life, doing her best to support her son and his family, and resuming her position as first lady of the land. Elisabeth lived to see her son become king (but also go into exile and abdicate), her younger son become, effectively, regent of the realm, and her grandson mount the throne. As queen dowager, she became a patron of the arts and was known for her friendship with such notable scientists as Albert Einstein. During the German occupation of Belgium from 1940 to 1944, she used her influence as queen and German connections to assist in the rescue of hundreds of Jewish children from deportation by the Nazis.Élisabeth en Bavière - her activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website When Brussels was liberated, she allowed her palace to be used for headquarters of the British XXX Corps, and presented its commander General Horrocks with its mascot, a young wild boar named 'Chewing Gum'.p.70, Horrocks, Brian, Belfield, Eversley, Essame, H., Corps Commander, Magnum Books, London, 1977 After the war she was awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government. During the 1950s, the Queen evoked controversy abroad by visiting the Soviet Union, China and Poland, trips that prompted some to label her as the \\"Red Queen\\". Queen Elisabeth died in Brussels at the age of 89 on 23 November 1965 from a heart attack. She is interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken, Brussels. She was the 1,016th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa. Legacy The city of Lubumbashi in Congo (Kinshasa) was formerly known as \\"Élisabethville\\", and it was named in her honor when it was founded in 1910 in what was then the Belgian Congo. It adopted its current name in 1966 when, after six years of wrangling following independence, the regime of Joseph Desire Mobutu began purging The Congo of its colonial-era place names. The Queen Elisabeth Competition, an international competition for career-starting musicians held in Brussels, is named after her.

Early career Gillespie started his career at his local club Falkirk, captaining the side at 17. Such was his rapid progression as a player, that after only playing 22 Scottish League Second Division fixtures, he was purchased by Coventry City for £75,000 on 10 March 1978, while still not yet 18. He spent the rest of the 1977–78 season in the City reserves but was given his chance at the beginning of the following season, making his debut on 19 August 1978 in a 2–1 win over Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. He went on to make a further 14 league appearances before the end of the season and made more League appearances for Coventry City than for any other club during his career. Liverpool signed him on 8 July 1983 for £325,000. He was the first signing made by new manager Joe Fagan. Liverpool Gillespie took a while to settle in, mainly because defenders Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen were ahead of him, but eventually he got into the team, making his debut on 7 February 1984 in the 2–2 League Cup draw with Walsall at Anfield. He played 14 times in the 1985–86 season, scoring three league goals, as the Reds sealed the double of the league title and the FA Cup, beating their local rivals Everton into second place and also defeating them 3–1 in the cup final at Wembley. Gillespie played enough games to warrant a league title winner's medal, but did not make the squad for the FA Cup final at a time when only one substitute was permitted. His three goals in that double winning season all came in the same game. Hat-tricks are rare for defenders, but Gillespie managed one against Birmingham City on 26 April 1986 at Anfield when he scored twice from open play and completed the threesome with a penalty, after the Liverpool fans chanted his name when it was awarded – normally he would not have taken it. Liverpool won the game 5–0 against an already relegated side, as they moved closer to the title, which was sealed on the final day of the season with a 1–0 win at Chelsea. Gillespie firmly established himself in the first team the following year, when he missed just three league games all season. By 1988, when he partnered Hansen in all but five of Liverpool's games in the league, the Anfield club were a cut above every other side, losing just twice and coasting to the title. Gillespie weighed in with his share of goals too, including one in a famous 5–0 hammering of Nottingham Forest, which critics, including Tom Finney, described as the finest domestic performance by any English club. A week before Liverpool were scheduled to face Wimbledon in the FA Cup final to try to secure their second \\"double\\", Gillespie and teammate Nigel Spackman clashed heads when leaping for the same ball in a league game against Derby County. Both suffered deep cuts, but were deemed fit for the game at Wembley and were each given customised protective bandages with red and white stripes to wear during the game. Gillespie was regarded as one of Liverpool's better players on the day, but Liverpool surprisingly lost 1–0. In April 1989, Gillespie joined his teammates in mourning the death of 94 Liverpool fans (the final death toll was 96) at the Hillsborough disaster, during a year in which he again was a regular feature in the team. This time fortunes were reversed – Liverpool won the FA Cup with an emotional victory over fierce Merseyside rivals Everton, but lost the League title to Arsenal with almost the last kick of the season. Gillespie missed that game, however. Gillespie won another league title with Liverpool in 1990, though his role in the team was diminishing, owing to the arrival of Swedish defender Glenn Hysen. However, he still managed four goals from just 13 league games. In 1990–91, with the absence and eventual retirement of Hansen due to injury, Gillespie was once again a regular in the centre of the Liverpool defence. He played 30 league games and scored once, remaining a regular player even after the resignation of Kenny Dalglish in February 1991 and the arrival of Graeme Souness as manager. Celtic The arrival of Mark Wright at Liverpool during the close season made it clear that Gillespie would no longer be considered a first choice defender, and he was transferred to Scottish club Celtic for £925,000 on 15 August 1991. He was among manager Liam Brady's first signings for the Bhoys, who were being left behind by local rivals Rangers who had been champions for the previous three seasons. His debut for the Glasgow club came on 17 August 1991, in a 4–1 league win over his former side Falkirk at Parkhead. Gillespie also managed to find the back of the net. He made 69 league appearances for the Parkhead club over three years, scoring twice, but failed to pick up any silverware. His performance was disappointing and he was not considered a good investment by Celtic's fans. Return to Coventry City and retirement Soon after the appointment of Tommy Burns as Celtic manager in 1994, it became apparent that Gillespie was not part of the new manager's plans. On 23 August 1994 he returned to Coventry City on a free transfer, making three Premier League appearances during the 1994–95 season. However, he played just three FA Premier League games before a knee injury struck him down, and he finally retired from playing in 1997 after more than two years out of action. Gillespie won 13 caps for Scotland. Andy Roxburgh gave him his debut on 14 October 1987 in the 2–0 UEFA European Championship qualifier victory over Belgium at Hampden Park. He was selected for the squad that went to the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, but his only appearance came on 20 June against Brazil at the Stadio delle Alpi Turin, a game the Scots lost 1–0. They failed to progress past the group stages. Since retirement Gillespie has served regularly as an expert summariser for Liverpool matches on BBC Radio Merseyside and is a regular member of the commentary team for Liverpool games on the official Liverpool TV channel LFC TV. He also continues to represent Liverpool in their veterans' side. Gillespie is still held in high regard among the Anfield faithful, who voted him No.68 in the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop compiled by the official Liverpool Football Club website.

Initially a member of the People's Action Party (PAP), he became a leader of the breakaway faction of Barisan Sosialis (BS) in 1961. After the BS merged with the Workers' Party (WP) in 1988, Lee stood as a WP candidate in the 1988 election and became Singapore's first Non- constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) due to his best performance among the opposition candidates. He served as the NCMP from September 1988 to August 1991. Biography Lee was born in Kuala Lumpur and was educated at Victoria Institution. He was trained as a medical doctor, but spent most of his life as a political leader. Lee served in Singapore's Legislative Assembly as a representative of the PAP following the 1959 election. In 1960 he served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs. In 1961, Lee and 13 other members of the assembly broke away from the PAP and formed the Socialist Front. Lee led the party in the 1963 elections, in which they won 13 of the 51 seats. Lee was noted for his pro-leftist stance and oratory skills. In 1961, he made the longest speech in the history of Singapore's Legislative Assembly which lasted seven hours on the subject of Singapore's proposed merger with Malaya. The Socialist Front was Singapore's main opposition party at the time of the country's independence in 1965. But the party boycotted the first post- independence general election in 1968, allowing the PAP to win all 51 of the seats in Parliament. The Socialist Front never managed to regain a significant role in Singapore's political scene after this, and in 1988, the party merged with the Workers' Party. At the 1988 general election, Lee stood as a Workers' Party candidate in the Eunos Group Representation Constituency along with fellow party members Francis Seow and Mohd Khalit bin Mohd Baboo. They lost very narrowly to the PAP's team in the constituency by 49.1% of the votes to 50.9%. Only one opposition MP was returned to Parliament at that election (Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Party). As the Workers' Party's team in Eunos had garnered a higher percentage of the vote than any other opposition losing candidates, the party was eligible to nominate two members of its team from Eunos to become Non-constituency MPs. The party had refused to nominate NCMPs in the past, but this time they nominated Lee and Seow to become NCMPs. Seow was subsequently accused of espionage and fled to the United States before he could take up his NCMP seat. But Lee became Singapore's first-ever NCMP, serving until the 1991 general election. In Parliament, he raised several issues, including the Internal Security Act, living costs and welfare. Lee again stood in Eunos GRC at the 1991 general election. He and fellow party members Jufrie Mahmood, Neo Choon Aik and Wee Han Kim again lost narrowly to the PAP's team by 47.6% of the votes to 52.4%. However no NCMP seats were offered following that election as the opposition parties won a combined total of four elected seats. His eldest son Lee Yew Kwong died in 1992. Lee left the Workers' Party in 1996, citing differences with the party's leader, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam. Lee died of lung cancer on 18 July 2002. He leaves behind his wife Kathleen Fam Yin Oi, two sons, Peter Lee Yew Chung and David Lee Yew Keong, and a daughter, Lee Yu Lian.

History Folwarks were operated in the Crown of Poland from the 14th century; in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 15th century; in the joint Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the second half of the 16th century; and survived after the partitions of the Commonwealth, in the Russian Empire, until the early 20th century. The purpose of folwarks was to produce surplus produce for export. The first folwarks were created on church- and monastery- owned grounds. Later they were adopted by both the nobility (szlachta) and rich peasants (singular: sołtys), but the sołtys positions were eventually taken over by the szlachta.Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper wyborcza.pl 2012-08-22, Arkadiusz Pacholski, Jak Polak zhańbił Polaka, czyli niewolnictwo po polsku [How a Pole shamed a Pole, or slavery in Polish] Folwark house at castle Frauenstein, Carinthia, Austria The term \\"folwark\\" came into the Polish language in the 14th century from the German \\"Vorwerk\\", originally the fortified advanced work of a castle, later an outlying manor house that managed a farm estate. The English translation would be grange, the historical meaning of which is \\"an outlying farm with tithe barns belonging to a monastery or feudal lord\\".http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/grange Creation of the folwarks was boosted by growing demand for grain and the profitability of its export, both to Western Europe and inside the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This led to the exploitation of serfdom, when land owners discovered that instead of money-based rent and taxes it was more profitable to force the peasantry to work on folwarks. Folwark-based grain export was an important part of the economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Folwarks were primarily an early modern, post-feudal rural formation. They originated as land belonging to a feudal lord (early on a knight) and not rented out to peasants but worked by his own hired labor or servants. The peasants toiled on the lots they rented from the lord, but in addition were obliged to provide complimentary labor for the lord on his folwark, originally a few days per year. From the 16th century, the amount of this mandatory free labor was radically increased and szlachta sponsored legislation imposed rigid conditions on the peasants, such as the prohibition on worker's right to leave a village and seek a new lord. The originally free peasants became serfs, and serfs then fell into a condition of extreme dependency and exploitation, known in Poland as wtórne poddaństwo [secondary serfdom]. Their lords in turn had become dependent on such slave labor, which kept the folwark economy going and \\"competitive\\" on the European grain markets.http://www.historycy.org portal, 2012-07-17, Przemysław Wielgosz, Pięćset lat kacetu. Ojczyzna-pańszczyzna [Five hundred years of concentration camp. Fatherland-lord's land] In Poland serfdom was regulated (and increased) by the Privilege of Piotrków (1388) and the Privilege of Toruń (1520) (statutory privileges granted by kings to szlachta). With the fall of prices of agricultural goods at the end of the 17th century, the folwark economy was in crisis, and the szlachta's attempts to increase production by increasing the size of their folwarks (usually by appropriating peasant lands) and demanding more labour (usually by increasing the peasant workload) only compounded the economic crisis and further worsened the fate of the peasants, who had been, until then, no poorer than their average counterparts in Western Europe. In Lithuania serfdom was fully established during the Volok Reform in the middle of the 16th century. Until the end of the 18th century folwarks remained the basis for szlachta economic and political power. After the abolition of serfdom in Poland, folwarks used paid labor. Folwarks were abolished by the People's Republic of Poland with the Polish Committee of National Liberation decree of 6 September 1944, concerned with agricultural reform. After the end of Second World War folwarks were nationalised, resulting in PGRs – state-owned collective rural enterprises (Państwowe Gospodarstwo Rolne) or partitioned, usually with little or no compensation to their owners.

The film was directed by Roy Ward Baker with a screenplay written by Howard Clewes, based on the 1956 book of the same name by Kendal Burt and James Leasor. The film chronicles the true exploits of Oberleutnant Franz von Werra, a Luftwaffe pilot shot down over Britain in 1940. He initially tried to escape while captive in England, but was later successful during transfer to a Canadian POW camp.Erickson, Hal. \\"The One That Got Away (1957).\\" The New York Times. Retrieved: 6 May 2012. Von Werra was the only Axis POW to succeed in escaping during the war. The tongue-in-cheek issue with the title is that it celebrates the fact that only one single PoW escaped from Britain during the Second World War. The film therefore strives to emphasise what an exceptional man von Werra was. Plot Luftwaffe fighter pilot Franz von Werra is shot down during the Battle of Britain and captured. At the POW reception centre, Air Defence Intelligence, located at Trent Park in Cockfosters, near Barnet in Hertfordshire, he wagers with his RAF interrogator that he will escape within six months. Initially, von Werra is sent to No 1 prisoner-of-war (POW) camp Grizedale Hall in the Furness area of Lancashire. His first escape involves dropping over a wall he is lying on during a group walk. He rolls over a horse and cart passes. He is spotted by some land army girls in the field but their frantic waving to the guards is mistaken for fraternisation. Only when the count is run at the end and it registers 23 instead of 24 do they realise he is missing. The CO retraces their route on horseback but it is too late, and the horse shoes give advances warning of his approach, allowing von Werra to hide. He heads into the hills. Von Werra wears his leather flight jacket donning his Iron Cross during this. This results in an intense manhunt by troops and police. He has the cheek to tauntingly wave to them from a hilltop. He lies flat in the mud on an open moor in heavy rain and they almost miss him. When they find him they are very kind and wrap him in a blanket. En-route by rail to his new camp at Swanwick he makes study of the map of Derbyshire hanging in the station waiting room. Subsequently, von Werra is sent to a more secure POW camp (based on the Hayes Conference Centre) near Swanwick, Derbyshire. During a German air raid he and four others escape through a tunnel. The others pair up, but von Werra continues alone. Reaching Codnor Park railway station, he impersonates a Dutch pilot and claims his Wellington bomber had crashed while on a secret mission. The station master telephones the police who are to then take him to the nearest airfield, RAF Hucknall, and tricks the duty officer into sending a car. However, the police arrive first, and with much bravado he delays them until the RAF car arrives. He gets to the airfield and spots a Hawker Hurricane. When his story starts to fray, von Werra creeps away and tries to steal an experimental Hawker Hurricane, getting as far as sitting and starting the engine before a pistol appears in his face and he is told \\"get out\\". Along with many other POWs, von Werra is then sent by ship to Canada. The ship arrives at Halifax, Nova Scotia, then there is a train journey. On the train ride across the country, while the guards are distracted, he escapes near Smiths Falls, Ontario, by jumping from a window. Making his way south hitching rides, von Werra finds the St Lawrence River not as solid as he has been led to believe, He then steals a rowboat and pushes it over the ice till he reaches the free-flowing section. He falls asleep in the drifting boat. He reaches the American side almost frozen to death. He is told he is in Ogdensburg, USA, where he is arrested despite claiming asylum in the then still-neutral United States. Back in England the RAF interrogator receives a postcard from von Werra, featuring a photograph of the Statue of Liberty, informing him that he has lost his bet. The epilogue states: > Despite the efforts of the Canadian Government to obtain his return, and of > the United States Authorities to hold him, Von Werra crossed the border into > Mexico. Travelling by way of Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Spain, he reached > Berlin on 18 April 1941. On October 25th of the same year, while on patrol, > his plane was seen to dive into the sea.

Habitat and biology Roanoke bass are found large creeks, streams and small rivers where they Prefer clear waters, although some turbidity may be tolerated, as well as in darker stained waters originating from swamps found in rivers such as the Nottoway and Blackwater. They are most frequently recorded in quite deep, fast flowing runs and around rocks and gravel, or at the heads of pools. They are predatory fish which feed in a wide variety of animals such as Tinsects, worms, leeches and crayfish, as well as smaller fish like fathead minnows, golden shiners and gizzard shad. In captivity,the males built and guarded nests in shallow water on gravel, sandy and muddy substrates were avoided. Conservation Roanoke bass have been assessed by the IUCN as being of Least Concern but NatureServe assess the species as Vulnerable and state that due to habitat degradation together with hybridisation and competition from introduced rock bass the species has declined.  Relationship with humans  The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at 0.62 kg (1 lb 5oz) caught in the Nottoway river of Virginia in 1991.

It is given to patients during surgery to relieve pain and as an adjunct to an anaesthetic. Remifentanil is used for sedation as well as combined with other medications for use in general anesthesia. The use of remifentanil has made possible the use of high-dose opioid and low-dose hypnotic anesthesia, due to synergism between remifentanil and various hypnotic drugs and volatile anesthetics.  Clinical use  Remifentanil is used as an opioid analgesic that has a rapid onset and rapid recovery time. It has been used effectively during craniotomies,Gesztesi Z, Mootz BL, White PF.

Comparison of remifentanil and fentanyl in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial space-occupying lesions. Anesthesiology. 1997;86(3):514-524. Administration It is administered in the form remifentanil hydrochloride and in adults is given as an intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 0.1 microgram per kilogram per minute to 0.5 (µg/kg)/min. Children may require higher infusion rates (up to 1.0 (µg/kg)/min). The clinically useful infusion rates are 0.025-0.1 (µg/kg)/min for sedation (rates adjusted to age of patient, severity of their illness and invasiveness of surgical procedure). Small amounts of other sedative medications are usually co-administered with remifentanil to produce sedation. Clinically useful infusion rates in general anesthesia vary but are usually 0.1-1 µg/kg/min. Remifentanil can be administered as part of an anesthesia technique called TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) using computer controlled infusion pumps in a process called target controlled infusion (TCI). A target plasma concentration is entered as ng/ml into the pump, which calculates its infusion rate according to patient factors like age and weight. Induction levels of 40 ng/ml are commonly used, but it generally varies between 3-8 ng/ml. For certain surgical procedures that produce particularly strong stimuli a level of up to 15 ng/ml might be needed. The relatively short context-sensitive half-life of Remifentanil allows the desired blood plasma level to be achieved quickly and also for the same reason, recovery occurs quickly. This allows remifentanil to be used in unique circumstances such as cesarean section. Remifentanil's short context-sensitive half-life makes it ideal for intense pain of short duration. As such, it has been used for analgesia in labor successfully; however, it is not as effective as epidural analgesia. In combination with propofol, remifentanil is used for anesthesia of patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy. Metabolism Remifentanil is considered a soft drug, one that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. Unlike other synthetic opioids which are hepatically metabolized, remifentanil has an ester linkage which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by non- specific tissue and plasma esterases. This means that accumulation does not occur with remifentanil and its context-sensitive half-life remains at 4 minutes after a 4-hour infusion. Remifentanil is metabolized to a compound (remifentanil acid) which has 1/4600th the potency of the parent compound. Due to its quick metabolism and short effects, remifentanil has opened up new possibilities in anesthesia. When remifentanil is used together with a hypnotic (i.e. one that produces sleep) it can be used in relative high doses. This is because remifentanil will be rapidly eliminated from the blood plasma on termination of the remifentanil infusion, hence the effects of the drug will quickly dissipate even after very long infusions. Owing to synergism between remifentanil and hypnotic drugs (such as propofol) the dose of the hypnotic can be substantially reduced. This leads often to more hemodynamic stability during surgery and a quicker post-operative recovery time. Side- effects Remifentanil is a specific μ-receptor agonist. Hence, it causes a reduction in sympathetic nervous system tone, respiratory depression and analgesia. The drug's effects include a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate and arterial pressure and respiratory rate and tidal volume. Muscle rigidity is sometimes noted. The most common side effects reported by patients receiving this medication are a sense of extreme \\"dizziness\\" (often short lived, a common side effect of other fast-acting synthetic phenylpiperidine narcotics such as fentanyl and alfentanil) and intense itching (pruritus), often around the face. These side effects are often controlled by either altering the administered dose (decreasing or in some cases, increasing the dose) or by administering other sedatives that allow the patient to tolerate or lose awareness of the side effect. Because pruritus is due to excessive serum histamine levels, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are often co-administered. This is done with care, however, as excessive sedation may occur. Nausea can occur as a side effect of remifentanil, however, it is usually transient in nature due to the drug's short half-life which rapidly removes it from the patient's circulation once the infusion is terminated. Potency Remifentanil is approximately twice as potent as fentanyl, and 100-200 times as potent as morphine. Circumventing naltrexone Remifentanil has been used with some success to circumvent naltrexone in patients who are in need of pain management.  Abuse potential  Remifentanil, being a μ-receptor agonist, functions like other μ-receptor agonists, such as morphine and codeine, and can cause euphoria and has the potential for abuse.Ternes, J. W., & O'Brien, C. P. (1990). The opioids: Abuse liability and treatments for dependence. Advances in alcohol & substance abuse, 9(1-2), 27-45.Panlilio, L. V., & Schindler, C. W. (2000). Self-administration of remifentanil, an ultra- short acting opioid, under continuous and progressive-ratio schedules of reinforcement in rats. Psychopharmacology, 150(1), 61-66. However, due to its rapid metabolism and short-acting half-life the likelihood of becoming abused is quite low. Nevertheless, there have been some documentations of remifentanil abuse.Baylon, G. J., Kaplan, H. L., Somer, G., Busto, U. E., & Sellers, E. M. (2000). Comparative abuse liability of intravenously administered remifentanil and fentanyl.

Anesthesia & Analgesia, 110(2), 524-525.  Development and marketing  Prior to the development of remifentanil, most short-acting hypnotics and amnestics faced issues with prolonged use, where accumulation would result in unfavorable lingering effects during post- operative recovery. Remifentanil was designed to serve as a strong anesthetic with an ultra-short and predictable duration that would not have accumulation issues.Feldman, P. L. (2006).

From 1999 to 2009, it was held annually in late September at Bowman Field in Louisville, Kentucky. The festival featured up to 100 hot air balloons participating in three early morning balloon races and two evening balloon glows. Other events included four live concerts, 11 free children's activities, and a car show featuring more than 150 classic, exotic, and modified cars. There was also a balloon education center teaching the fundamentals of ballooning, as well as food, a beer garden, and other activities. It was common to have crowds of more than 100,000 on the busiest day of the festival. Many events were held during the three days. One of the more popular attractions was the evening balloon glow, when balloons were inflated and glow to music after dark. Another was the early morning balloon race with a cash prize for the winner. The Adam Matthews Balloon Festival celebrated its last festival in September 2006. The festival was purchased by The Spirit of Kentucky Foundation and was renamed the Bluegrass Balloon Festival. History For many years, local pilots gathered to give back to the community by holding a year-end balloon glow at Bowman Field. When the local event was canceled due to the lack of funds, Adam Burckle, the founder of the Adam Matthews Cheesecake Company, came up with an idea that led to the festival. The first year event was held with 52 balloons in attendance. Many balloons were local, although some pilots traveled from far across the United States. The initial event raised $20,000 for the Dream Factory, an organization that helps grant wishes to children with life- threatening diseases. The second annual event was held in 2000 with 70 balloons from across the country. The event became so popular that the entry was limited to 70 balloons and there was a waiting list. The events of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. put some doubt into the flights of the festival, as civil aviation flights (including ballooning) were restricted for a period of time after the attacks. The festival petitioned the National Safety Council and the FAA to allow the flight of hot air balloons, which was approved only two days before the festival. Approximately 75 balloons attended the event that year, making it the largest balloon festival held in Kentucky's history. By 2002, the event had grown to 85 registered balloons, and WHAS-TV 11, a local television station in Louisville, featured the evening Balloon Glow during its prime time broadcast. Meijers sponsored the Starship Concert, and Dean's Milk sponsored the balloon races with more than $27,500 in prize money. Pilots travelled from as far as away as New Zealand, Canada and the Western U.S.; they raised more than $35,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Louisville Zoo, and the Crusade for Children. By 2003, the festival had grown to 100 registered balloons, with more than $40,000 in prizes awarded. There was also six hours of live TV coverage, and more than 120,000 people attended the event over three days. Portions of the parking fees benefited the Crusade for Children, and additional funds were raised for the Louisville Zoo and several other local non-profit groups. In 2007 the Adam Matthews Balloon Festival was purchased by the Spirit of Kentucky Foundation for $1, and the event was renamed the Bluegrass Balloon Festival. It continued to be the largest ballooning event in Kentucky and the fifth largest in the United States. The festival was cancelled in 2010 for various reasons. It was to return in 2011 with a new name, \\"Spirit of Kentucky Balloon Festival\\", but that was cancelled as well. There has been no sign of the existence of the festival since that time.

Album background  Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes was developed after the tour for Miles from Our Home. Geffen Records had gone through a merger, and in the process had stomped and squished Miles from Our Home, which caused the Cowboy Junkies to stand back and start making changes to take control of their music. They revived their early label, Latent Recordings, and set up a web-site for the label to share their music and thoughts with their fans. One of the first things they did was gather up several of their \\"orphaned\\" songs to release them to the world. The compilation album of rare and never before heard tracks, Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes, became the first release on Latent Recordings since The Trinity Session. The hidden track on the album, My Father's House, is an a capella rendition of a Bruce Springsteen song that the band occasionally performed live. The version on the album was recorded during the Sharon Temples recordings sessions. As Michael Timmins states, \\"Margo was singing to help Peter Moore find his mic placement. The rest of us had obviously been sitting around too long and were getting bored so we spontaneously joined in. Just one of those weird, beautiful moments...and the tape was running.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  Cowboy Junkies *Margo Timmins – vocals *Michael Timmins – guitar *Alan Anton – bass *Peter Timmins – drums Additional musicians *Ken Myhr – guitar (track 4, 5 & 10) *Richard Bell – piano (track 5) *Jeff Bird – harmonica, mandolin (tracks 1, 2, 4 - 6 & 10) *Jaro Czerwinec – accordion (tracks 2, 5, 6 & 8) *Kim Deschamps – dobro, pedal steel guitar (track 6) *Spencer Evans – piano (track 2 & 4) *Dave Houghton– percussion (tracks 1 & 9) Production *Michael Timmins – producer; engineer (track 3) *Bob Cobban – engineer (tracks 4, 5 & 10) *Bob Doidge, John Oliviera – engineer (tracks 2 & 6) *Dale Morningstar – engineer (tracks 7 & 8) *Tom Heron – engineer (tracks 1 & 9) *Michael Halbwachs – digital imaging *Dave Houghton – art direction *Peter Moore – mastering at the E Room  References   External links  Cowboy Junkies albums B-side compilation albums 1999 compilation albums Latent Recordings albums ","title":"Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes"},{"id":"1216567","text":"F.D. Roosevelt State Park is a Georgia state park located near Pine Mountain and Warm Springs. The park is named for former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who sought a treatment for his paralytic illness in nearby Warm Springs at the Little White House. The park is located along the Pine Mountain Range. The western portion of the park, formerly named Pine Mountain State Park, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1997. F.D. Roosevelt State Park is Georgia's largest state park. Several structures in the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the Great Depression, including a stone swimming pool and Roosevelt's favorite picnic spot at Dowdell's Knob, overlooking the valley below. President Roosevelt would take polio patients suffering from depression along on picnics at Dowdell's Knob. History The region containing the modern-day park was inhabited by the Creek Nation until ceded under the Treaties of 1825 and 1826, which granted the territories between the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers to the State of Georgia. An influx of settlers established the town of Kings Gap, named after King's Trading Post located near the modern-day Liberty Bell Pool. The town eventually vanished by the 20th century.\\"Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park Historical Background\\". Pamphlet published by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. In 1924, Franklin Delano Roosevelt first visited the warm springs located near the towns of Warm Springs and Bullochville. He came to the springs seeking relief from the symptoms of the paralytic illness he had contracted some years earlier. In 1927, Roosevelt and others established the Warm Springs Foundation, later known as the Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, which established therapeutic programs utilizing the area's mineral springs. Since then, the Institute has developed into a complex of facilities helping those with disabilities. Just prior to being elected president of the United States in 1932, Roosevelt built a residence nearby which would come to be known as the Little White House. After his election to the presidency, he spearheaded the establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was this organization which, in 1935, established a camp near the modern-day park entrance on Highway 354. From this camp, the young men of the CCC constructed much of the present state park, including the Liberty Bell Pool, the Roosevelt Lodge, several cabins, the Lake Delanor and its companion, the Lake Franklin. Because of the well-preserved CCC design, layout, and buildings of the western half of the park, and for its association with Roosevelt, that area was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1997. Geology and geography F.D. Roosevelt State Park is Georgia's largest state park. The park is located on the Pine Mountain Ridge, which is Georgia's southernmost mountainous area (and the southernmost mountainous area in the United States east of the Mississippi River). The Pine Mountain Ridge, which extends into Alabama, is composed of quartzite rock formations. It is geologically a feature of the Piedmont Plateau, not the Appalachian Mountains farther north. Dowdell's Knob is the highest point in F. D. Roosevelt State Park, at 1,395 feet. The knob was named for two pioneer Harris County settlers: Lewis & James Dowdell. The park contains the long Pine Mountain Trail, a scenic nature path that winds through both hardwood and pine forests, featuring hickory and several species of oak; forest undergrowth includes buckeye, pawpaw, azalea, blueberry and huckleberry. The trail has thirteen primitive back country campsites for backpackers. The Pine Mountain Trail is wholly maintained by the volunteers of the Pine Mountain Trail Association. In addition, the park contains two stocked fishing lakes and a historic trading post. There is a clump of surviving resistant chestnut trees in the park. Recent events On April 12, 2007, the 62nd anniversary of Roosevelt's death, a 1,200-pound bronze statue was unveiled at Dowdell's Knob. The statue depicts Roosevelt sitting on his removable car seat and wearing his leg braces. The statue, commissioned by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, was created by Atlanta sculptor Martin Dawe. During the 2011 Super Outbreak, an EF2 tornado caused severe damage to the park, especially in the campgrounds. It was estimated that 30% of the structures in one of the park's group campground areas were destroyed. Image:FDRstatue FDRstatepark.jpgF.D. Roosevelt's statue at Dowdell's Knob.

Founded in 1525 by Thomas Horsley, the Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne, it received royal foundation by Queen Elizabeth I and is the city's oldest institution of learning. It is one of 7 schools in the United Kingdom to bear the name \\"Royal Grammar School\\", of which two others are part of the independent sector. The School is located in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne in North East England, and is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. In 2008, RGS became fully co-educational after 450 years as an all boys' school. It has a current enrolment of more than 1,300 pupils. Former students are known as Old Novocastrians or Old Novos (\\"Novocastrian\\" is macaronic Latin for \\"citizen of Newcastle\\"). In 2012 and again in 2015, the Sunday Times Schools Guide named RGS the top performing school in the North of England based on academic results from A-levels and GCSEs. History The RGS was founded in 1525 by Thomas Horsley, within the grounds of St Nicholas' Church, Newcastle. Planning is believed to have begun as early as 1477. The site has moved five times since then, most recently to Jesmond in 1906. The new school building, designed by Sir Edward Cooper, was officially opened on 17 January 1907 by the 7th Duke of Northumberland. An 1868 description reads: > There are many public schools, the principal one being the Royal Free > Grammar school founded in 1525 by Thomas Horsley, Mayor of Newcastle, and > made a royal foundation by Queen Elizabeth. It is held in the old hall of > St. Mary's Hospital, built in the reign of James I., and has an income from > endowment of about £500, besides a share in Bishop Crew's 12 exhibitions at > Lincoln College, Oxford, lately abolished, and several exhibitions to > Cambridge. The number of scholars is about 140. Hugh Moises, and Dawes, > author of \\"Miscellanea Critica,\\" were once head-masters, and many celebrated > men have ranked among its pupils, including W. Elstob, Bishop Ridley, Mark > Akenside, the poet, Chief Justice Chambers, Brand, the antiquary and town > historian, Horsley, the antiquary, and Lords Eldon, Stowell, and > Collingwood. George III, on reading one of Admiral Collingwood's despatches after Trafalgar, asked how the seaman had learned to write such splendid English, but he answered himself, recalling that, along with Eldon and Stowell, he had been a pupil of Hugh Moises: \\"I forgot. He was one of Moises' boys.\\" For the duration of the Second World War the school was evacuated en masse to Penrith, Cumbria, where a special train carrying staff and around 800 pupils arrived on 1st September 1939. Meanwhile, the main school building was transformed into the Regional War Room, which undertook the vital strategic role of collating details of air raids across the region and passing these on to RAF Fighter Command. Several rudimentary air raid shelters were built above ground for military personnel, which although substantial enough to survive as store rooms until the end of the century would have offered little protection, even from an indirect hit. The school was one of several places in Newcastle upon Tyne where a small supply of ammunition to be used in the event of a German invasion was stored. Description RGS campus =School Grounds= The RGS is located opposite the Newcastle Prep School, and close to Newcastle High School for Girls, a single-sex girls' school formed through the merger of the Central High and Church High girls' schools. The school has its own swimming pool, climbing wall and gym. =Organisation= Throughout the school (years 3–13) are four houses, named Collingwood (yellow), Eldon (green), Horsley (blue) and Stowell (red), although the Junior School previously had separate houses, named after colours (red, white, and blue). The Senior School is located on Eskdale Terrace. The Junior School was housed on the adjoining Lambton Road, but a new Junior School on the main school site has been in use since September 2006. Geoffrey Stanford is Headmaster as of February 2020, replacing John Fern. There are 91 members of teaching staff in the Senior School. In the Junior School there are 16 members of teaching staff including the Headmaster James Miller. There are also approximately 68 members of maintenance staff and 14 private music tutors. The RGS school uniform was updated for all new pupils as of September 2006, and was then updated further in 2012–2013. =Clubs and Societies= The RGS has Combined Cadet Force (CCF) Army and Navy contingents, open to both boys and girls. Cadets have weekly training sessions after school, and opportunities to go on extended training and adventure trips during the holidays. The Army section of NRGS CCF is affiliated to the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and the Navy Section are affiliated to HMS Calliope, a stone frigate which is situated on the Tyne next to the Baltic Art Gallery. CCF information is in a section part-way down the page. In 2004 the school hosted the first Northern Junior Debating Championship, which has now become an annual competition. The society also regularly enters teams for other competitions, and has reached the finals' day of both the Oxford Union and Cambridge Union schools' competitions in recent years, winning the Cambridge Union competition in 2010. At a junior level, RGS won the Northern Junior Debating Competition in 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2014. The primary sports that are played at RGS are rugby, hockey, fencing, football, netball, cricket, swimming and athletics. =Magazines= The school magazine, Novo, comes out annually. A student-run newspaper, the Issue, came into being in the late 1990s; after a period of inactivity, it was relaunched as the re- Issue in September 2003. It ran roughly twice per term until its demise in summer 2005, but was replaced in early 2006 by The Grammar. At the end of the 2009–2010 academic year, The Grammar folded. In 2011 a new magazine called Vox was set up but is currently out of print. In 2017, an online group RGmemeS came into being. It is currently inactive. =Other= From 1965, the school held a \\"Prizegiving\\" ceremony each November, to recognise academic achievement and bring the school together. Due to declining interest by parents, students, and teachers, the school replaced this in 2007 with a series of smaller gatherings and a public festival. However, in 2009, Headmaster Bernard Trafford announced that a new Prizegiving ceremony \\"RGS Day\\" would be hosted on the Saturday of the penultimate week of the school year. In December 2006, the school were deeply shocked by the death of former Head of Drama, Jeremy Thomas, who had taught at the school for 28 years prior to leaving due to ill health. Jeremy had campaigned for years for a new Performing Arts Centre, but died before being able to see the finished product. Buildings and grounds The RGS's main buildings are in a complex located on Eskdale Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. The school hall boasts a fine organ donated by Sir Arthur Sutherland to commemorate the 138 former pupils who were killed during the First World War. There have since been a number of large-scale building operations to provide the school with better facilities and to accommodate for the expansion of the school as it prepared to admit girls at all major entrance points from September 2006. In 1997, Professor Richard Dawkins opened the new Science and Technology Centre (STC), with Physics and Design & Technology laboratories downstairs, and Chemistry and Biology laboratories upstairs. In 2003 the STC was renamed The Neil Goldie Centre in memory of Neil Goldie, who died earlier that year. At the time he was the school's Head of Science and Technology. In 1996, a new Sports' Hall containing basketball courts and updated gymnastics facilities was opened. The building also provides facilities for table tennis, fencing, and weight-training, plus a gymnasium and climbing wall. In 2005, the music and economics block was demolished. A new Performing Arts Centre and Modern Languages department was completed in September 2006. It includes a 300-seat auditorium, named the \\"Miller Theater\\" in memory of former headmaster James Miller, for school concerts and productions, a musical recital hall, a drama/dance studio, recording facilities, a band room, a percussion room, and a number of classrooms. A floodlit all-weather surface has been in use since January 2006, on land that once was part of the school field. Aside from the school field, which is primarily used for rugby union, the school also owns land in nearby Jesmond for sports use. This was given to the school in recompense for the land it lost when the flyover was created at the top of the school - eating into some of the land owned by the school. The school is also the landlords of Sutherland Park in Benton. Sutherland Park is named after Arthur Sutherland (1878–1883) who bought the grounds of Benton Lodge in 1925 for Novocastrians Rugby Football Club. The ground and clubhouse was sold to the school at a later date. The club was set up by former pupils of the school in 1899; many Old Novos still represent and play for the club to this day. The school has also recently agreed a 50-year lease of the County Cricket Ground on Osborne Avenue, Jesmond.FRESH START SAVES HISTORIC CRICKET GROUND. newcastlecc.co.uk In October 2015, the school was the team base for the Scottish national rugby union team during the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In October 2019 a new library, art facilities and pastoral care centre, was opened. In addition, the school also redeveloped the sixth form area, which opened in January 2020.

A trophy is awarded to the winning school. Background Since 1990 the game has been held the final Saturday in November (i.e., the Saturday after Thanksgiving) at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, organizers moved the 2005 event from the Superdome to Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, where many of New Orleans' evacuees were living. This was the only time that the Bayou Classic was held outside of Louisiana. The 2006 Bayou Classic returned to the Superdome. It is the best known annual game and rivalry in historically black college or university (HBCU) football and was nationally televised in the U.S. by NBC from 1991 to 2014. Since 2015 it has aired on the NBC Sports Network. The Bayou Classic was the only National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Football Championship Subdivision game to be shown regularly on broadcast television. Fans have been known to refer to it as the \\"Black Super Bowl\\", although that name is not used in any official capacity by either school due to the National Football League's restrictions on the use of the \\"Super Bowl\\" name. Both schools typically forgo FCS playoff eligibility to participate in the Bayou Classic. The game is one of two black college football classics to be associated with Thanksgiving weekend; the other is the older Turkey Day Classic. The game had State Farm Insurance as its title sponsor from 1996 to 2011. Other activities Of the many activities held in conjunction with the game, the most well-known and well-attended is the two- part Battle of the Bands, where both universities' marching bands—Grambling's \\"World Famed\\" Tiger Marching Band and Southern's Human Jukebox—perform. Following the Greek show, the two renowned bands stage elaborately choreographed performances on the Friday night before the game. The final part is held during the football game's halftime show. There is no official judge for the band battle. Since 1992, members of South Louisiana's Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) run with the game ball from Southern's campus in North Baton Rouge to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in downtown New Orleans for the annual \\"Bayou Classic Motivation Run.\\" The event happens the day before the game begins and is an approximately 100 mile run that takes between 8 and 10 hours to complete. Members of the NROTC take turns running with the ball while a police escort follow them along the way.http://www.subr.edu/assets/NavyROTC/PAOarticles/BayouClassicMotivationalRun2014.pdf Other activities include a golf tournament, coaches luncheon, a concert/festival, tailgating, fashion show, pep rally, alumni functions, college recruitment fair, a Thanksgiving Day Parade (which was brought back in 2011), and a job fair for graduating students of both schools. An annual Grambling vs. Southern \\"Miss Bayou Classic\\" beauty pageant was also held from 1976 to 2002. Impact The Bayou Classic is a major source of revenue ($50 million) to the city of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana. 250,000 visitors descend upon New Orleans over the course of the events leading up to the game, and the national television audience has attracted between four and five million viewers. The success of the game has inspired the promotion of numerous other HBCU rivalries and \\"classics\\". In the past the stadium attendance had averaged between 50,000–70,000 annually. Hurricane Katrina brought some challenges, first with a one-year move to Houston, then with a slight drop-off in attendance upon the classic's return to New Orleans—all while the Florida Classic and Magic City Classic gained significantly in prominence over that same time period. Though the Bayou Classic also lost its title sponsor in 2011 and GSU faced numerous issues during its 2013 season, officials in 2014 rejected suggestions to remove GSU as a participant and instead resolved to quickly rejuvenate the classic. Attendance has now climbed significantly each year since 2011 and is again near pre-Katrina levels. The game also remains nationally televised, although NBC did move the game broadcast over to its sister sports-only network in 2015. Series history Historically, Grambling State and Southern have arguably had the two most successful football teams in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. Through the 2018 season Grambling has more SWAC football titles than any other school (25, not including their vacated 1975 title); Southern has the second most with 19. Grambling and SU also have more black national titles than any other SWAC schools; as of 2017 Grambling has the second most in the entire country with 15 total, while SU has the fourth most at the FCS-level (11). The two schools have also represented the SWAC in 13 of the 15 Pelican, Heritage, and Celebration bowls that have been held. Through 2015 Florida A&M; of the Mid- Eastern Athletic Conference was the only FCS-level HBCU school with more football wins (588) than Southern (578) or Grambling (565). However both Grambling and Southern were ordered by the NCAA to vacate wins in multiple sports due to the questionable eligibility of hundreds of their student athletes between 2010 and 2015. It is not immediately clear just which Grambling football games are effected by these rulings, but the NCAA did make a special point to specify that Grambling's 2011 season record and championships remain fully intact; games played between 2012 and 2015, however, appear to remain possible candidates for being vacated. Southern, meanwhile, had to vacate all of its 2013 and 2014 wins, at the very least. Through now, Southern leads the overall series with Grambling, begun in 1932, by a 36–33 margin. This total does not include two vacated wins but includes one forfeited loss.) Both teams have 23 overall victories, and Grambling State claims the longest winning streak in the all-time series, nine games from 1970 to 1978 (including SU's 1972 forfeit). Southern claims the longest winning streak in the Bayou Classic era, eight games from 1993 to 2000 (the Jaguars also had a previous eight-game winning streak at the start of the series, in the games played between 1932 and 1946). Grambling's 43–6 victory in 1980 ranks as the largest margin of victory in the Bayou Classic, while SU's 1935 victory (64–6) is the largest margin in the all-time series. Multiple trophies have been awarded to the winner of the Bayou Classic over the years. The most recent trophy, consisting of Waterford Crystal, was retired after the 2014 game after more than 25 years of service and presented to the Smithsonian Institution for its National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. A newly designed trophy has been showcased since the 2015 game. People prominently involved in the series include Ace Mumford (SU coach from 1936–42 and again in 1944–61), Eddie Robinson (SU student, albeit briefly, in the 1930s and GSU coach from 1941–42 and again 1945–97), Doug Williams (GSU player from 1974–77, SU consultant in 1985, and GSU coach from 1998–2003 and again 2011–13), Marino Casem (SU athletic director from 1986–99 and coach from 1987–88 and again 1992), Pete Richardson (SU coach from 1993–2009), and Rod Broadway (GSU coach from 2007–10). Mumford once had the third most wins among all college football coaches (behind Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg), and Robinson later had the most. Today Robinson still has the third most wins (behind John Gagliardi and Joe Paterno) and also has the most wins among all who coached at HBCU schools; Mumford now has the fourth most wins among HBCU coaches behind Robinson, Billy Joe, and John Merritt. Broadway holds the distinction of being the only coach to have ever won a black national title at three different schools, one of which was Grambling. Prior to 1974, though the game was viewed as a big in-state rivalry between the two schools, it was not nearly the media spectacle that it is today. After it was re-branded as the Bayou Classic and moved to New Orleans, a trophy was added and numerous events were also scheduled to be held throughout the week leading up to the game itself. Games in the series played before 1974 are generally not included within the context of the Bayou Classic's historical lineage. SU led the series 15–10 up until that point. The annual game was known to be touted as a \\"classic\\" as early as the 1948 meeting, a game that the Jaguars won in an 18–0 upset before 10,000 fans. A brawl during that game led to a suspension of the series for the next decade (a period in which the Jaguars won three black national championships) and delayed GSU's admittance to SWAC membership until 1958, shortly before the rivalry was resumed. With the renewal of the series in 1959, the game was again billed as a \\"classic\\" but proved a bittersweet return as five fans were killed in a vehicular accident on their way to the game. The series was again interrupted in 1972, this time due to political unrest on host Southern's campus—which resulted in a forfeiture by SU. The game was then permanently moved to off-campus neutral sites the following year, drawing a large crowd of 40,000 in Shreveport, Louisiana, and influencing the decision to create the Bayou Classic. 2020 will see no Classic rivalry happening because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Instead, the two teams will have April 17, 2021, at Shreveport’s Independence Stadium.

Turing is depicted sitting on a bench situated in a central position in the park. On Turing's left is the University of Manchester and on his right is Canal Street. The statue was unveiled on 23 June, Turing's birthday, in 2001. It was conceived by Richard Humphry, a barrister from Stockport, who set up the Alan Turing Memorial Fund in order to raise the necessary funds. Humphry had come up with the idea of a statue after seeing Hugh Whitemore's play Breaking the Code, starring Sir Derek Jacobi. Jacobi became the patron of the Fund.

Roy Jackson (who had previously raised funds for HIV/AIDS and Gay Awareness in Manchester) was asked to assist in the funding raising to make the memorial happen. Within 12 months, through donations and a \\"village lottery\\", the money was raised. This allowed the statue to be cast in China.

The laws in Spain (see Spanish nationality law) limit who may be granted Spanish citizenship from Latin America to parents and grandparents who once held Spanish citizenship. More recently the legal system in Spain has granted citizenship to Cubans who can prove that their grandparents immigrated to Cuba during the Spanish Civil War (see Law of Historical Memory). Population The population of Canadians self-identified as of Spanish descent is 325,740, including those with multiple ethnic backgrounds. However, the laws in Spain limit the people who may be called Spaniard to those who can hold a European Union Spanish Citizenship. For example, a Latin American would not be considered Spanish or a Spaniard in Spain until he can prove that his most recent parents or grandparents once held a Spanish passport or citizenship. The actual population that can legally be called Spaniard is probably only a fraction of the 325,730. This error originates with the actual Canadians who tend to blindly group all Latin Americans who speak the Spanish language as Spanish. Spanish Canadians who hold Spanish Citizenship from Spain are mostly concentrated in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. Spaniards are found in all areas of the city of Montreal as well as in suburbs such as Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Laval, Brossard and Greenfield Park. There is no \\"Spanish quartier\\", but Montreal’s Rue Saint-Laurent is home to Spanish associations, which should not be confused with Latin American Associations, as well as to the Librería Española.Community Life The present day Canadian Spanish population did not appear in Ontario and Quebec until the mid 20th century and have not really had a profound impact in developing or promoting their language and culture, unlike the Spanish Speaking Latin American Canadian community. This in part is due to the fact that the Spanish population in Canada is almost insignificant in comparison to the Spanish speaking Latin American Canadian community. As a rule of thumb, the second generation Spanish Canadians seem to have become indifferent or have lost interest in having any ties to Spain and have easily been absorbed into the anglophone or francophone Canadian culture. History =Spanish claims and presence in Canada= Lines dividing the non-Christian world between Castille (modern Spain) and Portugal: the 1494 Tordesillas meridian (purple) and the 1529 Zaragoza antimeridian (green) Spain had land claims to all of Canada since Christopher Columbus claimed the New World for Spain on October 12, 1492. Through the Treaty of Tordesillas signed June 7, 1494 the Pope Alexander VI divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. Portugal received the eastern portion of Brazil and Spain received the rest, which included Canada.(see Treaty of Tordesillas) Vasco Núñez de Balboa was the first European to take possession of the Pacific Ocean and adjoining lands for Spain. Later the Spanish conquistador and explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa became the first European to see and stand in the waters of the eastern shore of the Pacific Ocean. He accomplished this feat after an arduous trek through the jungles of what is now Panama. Once there Balboa with raised hands, his sword in one and a standard with the image of the Virgin Mary in the other, he walked knee-deep into Ocean, and claimed possession of the Pacific Ocean and all adjoining lands (which included British Columbia) for Spain in the name of his Spanish sovereigns on September 13, 1513. Then a Greek born Spanish explorer Juan de Fuca in the service of the king of Spain, Philip II, explored the Strait of Anián in 1592, now known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Vancouver Island, now part of British Columbia, Canada and northwestern Washington state, United States. People from northwestern Spain known as Basques have been landing in Newfoundland since the late 14th century to dry their cod fish, which they caught in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. By 1578 Anthony Parkhurst, a merchant, explorer, and advocate of English settlement in Newfoundland, was able to count over 100 Spanish vessels at Newfoundland, all seeking cod. In contrast, the level of English activity during this period was quite small - Parkhurst claimed that in 1573 there were only four English vessels at Newfoundland. =Spanish Presence in the Pacific Northwest= Areas of Alaska and British Columbia explored by Spanish explorers Starting in the mid-18th century, Spain's claim began to be challenged in the form of British and Russian fur trading and colonization. King Charles III of Spain and his successors sent a number of expeditions to present-day Canada and Alaska between 1774 and 1793, to counter the threat of Russian and British colonizers and to strengthen the Spanish claim. During this period of history it was important for a nation's claims to be backed up by exploration and the \\"first European discovery\\" of particular places. Since Spain was busy colonizing Latin America, Canada was ignored until the 18th century when Spain made an effort to explore and set up forts in British Columbia. While it is thought that Sir Francis Drake may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was Juan Pérez who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and de la Bodega reasserted the Spanish claim for the Pacific coast, first made by Vasco Núñez de Balboa in 1513. Map showing results of the Adams–Onís Treaty Map of the Oregon Country \\"jointly occupied\\" by the US and Britain. The Columbia Department at its greatest extent included areas far to the north and south. =Spanish dispute with Britain= A major war between Spain and Britain over British Columbia could have begun via the Nootka Sound dispute in 1789. Spain at the time sent José Martínez to occupy Nootka Sound and establish exclusive Spanish sovereignty. During the summer of 1789 a number of fur trading vessels, British and American, arrived at Nootka. A conflict over sovereignty arose between the captain of the British Argonaut, James Colnett, and Martínez. By the end of the summer Martínez had arrested Colnett, seized several British ships, and arrested their crews. Colnett had come to Nootka Sound intending to build a permanent trading post and colony on land previously acquired by his business associate John Meares. At the end of the summer Martínez abandoned Nootka and took the captured ships and prisoners to San Blas, New Spain. The news about these events triggered a confrontation between Spain and Britain known as the Nootka Crisis which nearly led to war. A major war over British Columbia with the British was peacefully resolved via the Nootka Convention, with both parties retaining their claims until a future solution could be finalized. =The United States inherits Spain's dispute with Great Britain= In the early 19th century, Spain was weakened due to the Napoleonic Wars and the Spanish American Wars of Independence it had to fight in South America against Simon Bolivar and San Martin. Eventually, Spain felt that in its weakened state it might lose its North American territories to Britain. As a result of this, Spain decided to transfer its claims to parts of North America to its old ally United States during the American Revolution through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819. In exchange, the U.S. promised to pay U.S. residents claims against the Spanish government totaling $5,000,000. Consequently, the United States of America has used its inherited Spanish rights to support its claims to the Oregon country which consisted of the Oregon Territory and British Columbia during the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain.

Originally a small area north of the township of Warrington, it is now a large area between the town centre and the M62, incorporating other small communities, such as Longford. Orford area had a population of 10,950 at the 2001 census. Orford Hall was demolished in the 1930s after the grounds were given to the town for Orford Park. Jubilee Park, a £30m project providing community and sporting facilities on former waste land between the park and Winwick Road, opened May 2012. William Beamont, a Victorian solicitor and philanthropist, lived at Orford Hall, which had previously been the seat of the Blackburne family. He founded Warrington's municipal library, the first rate-aided library in England, in 1848. His diaries are a valuable source of social history. Another notable local family were the Booths, who built Orford House in the late 18th century, ancestors of Charles Booth of the Liverpool shipowning family. There is one high school, Beamont Collegiate Academy, and several primary schools. Geography The area is primarily given over to housing, most being council housing, though many council houses are now in private ownership. Boundaries are Greenwood Estate to the east (after which it becomes Cinnamon Brow), Winwick Road to the west (where it becomes Bewsey), the M62 to the north (where it becomes Winwick) and Marsh House Lane to the south (where it becomes Fairfield). Transport The area is well served by bus services. The services that serve the main part of the district are the Orford circulars (services 20 and 21), services to Gorse Covert and Birchwood (services 25-27), also several services serve Winwick Road on the western edge of the district (services 19, 22, 329 and 360). Service 17 was extended in 2012 from the west of town to serve Orford and other communities on the north-east side of the town. With the exceptions of the 329 and 360 (operated by Arriva North West), all services are operated by Warrington's Own Buses. The nearest railway stations are those in the town centre (Central (for services to Manchester and Liverpool) and Bank Quay (for services via the West Coast Main Line)). Census data Data is based on that of the ward of Orford =Population and ethnicity= Orford ward has a population of 11,010 resident, of which 49.5% are male and 50.5% are female. The average age of the population is 36.3 years. The majority of the population are described as white (98.5%). Other key majorities are mixed (0.5%), black (0.1%), and Asian (0.7%). The remainder accounts for other racial origins. =Housing and social situation= There are 4,418 households in this ward of Warrington. 65.3% of houses are owner occupied. 27.5% are classed as council accommodation. 4.7% are rented from private landlords and 2.6% have residents who are living rent free. The average house price in this ward is £100,420. Of the 4,418 households, 6.5% are overcrowded. The population density is 53.9 residents per hectare. Based on the ACORN index, the majority of residents describe the ward as \\"hard- pressed\\". It is also the most deprived ward in Warrington borough. 10.2% of residents are on benefits. =Employment and education= 59.1% of economically active residents are employed. However, the unemployment rate amongst the economically active is 4.6% which is almost twice the borough's unemployment rate. 2.2% of all economically active residents are in full-time education. Those that are economically inactive (due to retirement, long-term disability/illness, or full-time carer status) account for 34.3% of the population. In terms of education, 38.5% of residents do not have any qualifications whatsoever. However the majority (45.6%) have level one (Minimum 1+ GCSEs A*-G or equivalent) or level two (Minimum 5+ GCSEs (A*-G) or 1+ A-level (A-E) or equivalent) qualifications.

Ludus Tonalis (\\"Play of Tones\\", \\"Tonal Game\\", or \\"Tonal Primary School\\" after the Latin Ludus Litterarius), subtitled Kontrapunktische, tonale, und Klaviertechnische Übungen (Counterpoint, tonal and technical studies for the piano), is a piano work by Paul Hindemith that was composed in 1942 during his stay in the United States. It was first performed in 1943 in Chicago by Willard MacGregor. The piece explores \\"matters of technique, theory, inspiration, and communication. It is in effect, a veritable catalogue of the composer's mature style.\\"Satola, Mark (205). \\"Ludus Tonalis\\", All Music Guide to Classical Music, p.612. Hal Leonard. . The piece, which comprises all 12 major and/or minor keys, starts with a three-part Praeludium in C resembling Johann Sebastian Bach's toccatas, and ends with a Postludium which is an exact retrograde inversion of the Praeludium. In between, there are twelve three-part fugues separated by eleven interludes, beginning in the tonality of the previous fugue and ending in the tonality of the next fugue (or in a different tonality very close to that). The tonalities of the fugues follow the order of his Serie 1 and use the keynote C (see The Craft of Musical Composition).Tippett, Michael (1995). Tippett on Music, p.77. Oxford University. . Ludus Tonalis was intended to be the twentieth-century equivalent to J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier.Liner Notes by Marc Vignal to \\"Hindemith, 2nd Sonata & Ludus Tonalis\\"; played by Sviatoslav Richter – Pyramid Records, Inc. NY catalogue no. 13497\\" Unlike Bach's work, though, the non-fugal pieces in Ludus Tonalis frequently repeat the work's main theme. Ludus Tonalis can be thought of as the most direct application of Hindemith's theory that the twelve tones of the equally tempered scale all relate to a single one of them (called a tonic or keynote). The affinity of each note with the keynote is directly related to its position on the harmonic scale. In this system, the major-minor duality is meaningless and the practice of modulation is dropped, although subject modulation occurs in the second fugue, to create growing tension.

He was a representative of the major Czech political party, the Young Czechs, in the Austrian Imperial Council from 1891 to 1915 (where he was also known as Karl Kramarsch), becoming the party leader in 1897. During the First World War, Kramář was imprisoned for treason against Austria-Hungary but later released under an amnesty. In 1918, he headed the Czechoslovak National Committee in Prague, which declared independence on 28 October. Kramář became the first Prime Minister of the new state but resigned over policy differences less than a year later. Although he remained a member of the National Assembly until his death in 1937, his conservative nationalism was out of tune with the main political establishment, represented by the figures of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and Edvard Beneš. Early life He was born in Vysoké nad Jizerou (Hochstadt an der Iser), near the northern border of what is now the Czech Republic, in a rich family. He was the only one of five children to survive to school age. Kramář was educated at the Universities of Prague, Strasbourg and Berlin and the Paris École des Sciences Politiques; he obtained a doctorate in law. In the 1880s, Kramář played a prominent role in the agitation against the fact that Charles-Ferdinand University (now Charles University) in Prague offered instructions almost exclusively in German; demands were made for a Czech language university so that Czech students could be educated in their own language. The issue of whatever the language of instruction at Charles- Ferdinand University would be German or Czech was an extremely controversial one in the early 1880s, leading to frequent fights on the streets of Prague between ethnic German and ethnic Czech students. Finally in 1882, the Emperor Franz-Josef approved breaking Charles-Ferdinand University into two independent branches, with one that offered instructions in Czech and another instructions in German. Early career He became the leader of the Young Czech Party in Austria-Hungary and later of the National Democratic Party in Czechoslovakia. In 1896, Kramář become the Austrian Minister of Finance.Seton- Watson, R.W \\"Karel Kramer\\" pages 183–189 from The Slavic and Eastern European Review, Volume 16, No. 46, July 1937 page 183. Like other Slavic politicians in the Dual Monarchy, Kramář disliked the Compromise of 1867 that he felt had elevated the Magyars to a position of political power that their numbers did not warrant and wanted the Austrian Empire to abandon its alliance with Germany in favor of an alliance with Russia.Seton-Watson, R.W \\"Karel Kramer\\" pages 183–189 from The Slavic and Eastern European Review, Volume 16, No. 46, July 1937 pages 183–184. Kramář believed that with time and democracy in the form of universal suffrage would transform the Austrian Empire into a Slavic state as the Slavic peoples were the most numerous of the various ethnic groups in the empire. Like many other Young Czechs, Kramář was a Russophile, seeing Russia as the world's only Slavic great power that counterbalanced the dominant ethnic Germans of the Habsburg monarchy.Winters, Stanley \\"The Young Czech Party (1874–1914): An Appraisal\\" pages 426–444 from Slavic Review, Vol. 28, No. 3. Sept 1969 page 439. Kramář's wife was a Russian socialite, the daughter of a Moscow industrialist and until 1917 they owned a lavish villa in the Crimea.Seton-Watson, R.W \\"Karel Kramer\\" pages 183–189 from The Slavic and Eastern European Review, Volume 16, No. 46, July 1937 page 184. Kramář was fascinated with Russian culture and loved Russian literature. Tomáš Masaryk often criticized Kramář for the contradiction between his push for universal suffrage and democracy in the Austrian Empire and his support of closer ties with the autocracy of Imperial Russia. The October Manifesto of 1905 was hailed by Kramář as a sign that Russia was liberalizing and would soon become a democratic power in the near-future. In 1908 in Prague, in 1909 in St. Petersburg and in 1910 in Sofia, Kramář attended Pan-Slavic congresses. Along similar pan-Slavic lines, Kramář worked for a \\"Slavic Bloc\\" in the Reichsrat that would unite all of the parties representing the Slavic peoples into one bloc against the House of Habsburg. Kramář's pro-Russian inclinations caused much tensions with the ethnic Polish and Ukrainian politicians as both the Poles and the Ukrainians preferred to be part of the Austrian Empire rather than the Russian Empire. Kramář pushed the government to provide greater legal expression of the Czech language, for instance allowing court cases in Bohemia to be conducted in Czech rather than German and for bilingual signs in both German and Czech at Army bases in the \\"Czech lands\\" of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.Winters, Stanley \\"The Young Czech Party (1874–1914): An Appraisal\\" pages 426–444 from Slavic Review, Vol. 28, No. 3. Sept 1969 page 441. Kramář had little love for the House of Habsburg, which as the British historian R.W. Seton-Watson observed that for more than 500 years had showed nothing but \\"detestation\\" of the Czech people, but he was willing to accept that the Czechs remain part of the Austrian Empire, provided that the empire was reorganized to give greater autonomy to the \\"Czech lands\\" that consisted of the provinces of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.Seton-Watson, R.W \\"Karel Kramer\\" pages 183–189 from The Slavic and Eastern European Review, Volume 16, No. 46, July 1937 page 185. A liberal nationalist with close ties to the political elite in Prague and Vienna, Kramář pursued a policy of cooperation with the Austrian state as the best means of achieving Czech national goals before the First World War, even as he favored closer ties between the Czechs and the Russian Empire. His commitment to this policy of cooperation with the Austrian government (\\"positive politics\\" in the parlance of the day) led him to resign his leadership of the Young Czech party in 1914 as the party drifted toward a more nationalist and oppositional stance. By 1914, Kramář was already drifting out of the political mainstream. World War I When the First World War began in 1914, Kramář concluded that a victory for Germany and Austria would mark the end of the possibility of reform in the Austrian Empire and to work against the Habsburg monarchy. In the fall of 1914, Kramář advised the other Czech politicians to wait as \\"the Russians will do it for us alone\\". Kramář was referring to the Russian victories in Galicia in September 1914 that saw about 50% of the entire Austrian Army killed, wounded or captured, a crippling blow that ended whatever possibility that might had existed for Austria to be an equal partner with Germany and reduced the Austrians down to very much junior partners of the Germans. The way in Austria-Hungary started to function more and more as a satellite state of Germany led to increasing Czech support for independence during the war as it became clear that if the Central Powers won then there would be no possibility of the Slavic peoples of the Austrian Empire ever becoming the equals of the ethnic Germans and the Magyars. In March 1915, Kramář was together with Přemysl Šámal, Alois Rašín, Josef Scheiner and Edvard Beneš a founding member of an underground group called the Maffie which was dedicated to winning Czech independence from the Austrian empire. The Maffie was in contact with Russian military intelligence and used secret codes to pass on messages to Petrograd. On 3 April 1915, Kramář learned that the entire 28th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Austrian and Royal Hungarian Army, which had been recruited from the working class districts of Prague, had surrendered en masse to the Russians in Galicia. Kramář sent a message to the Russians asking that Czech independence be declared to be one of the war aims of the Allies. On 3 May 1915, Kramář told the Agrarian deputy in the Reichsrat Josef Dürich who was about to go abroad to seek Allied support for independence that he should seek a \\"great Slav empire\\" under the House of Romanov in which Bohemia would be an autonomous kingdom ruled by some Romanov grand duke. During the First World War the Austrian authorities charged Kramář with treason, tried him and ultimately sentenced him to 15 years of hard labour. Kramář was arrested and charged with high treason on 21 May 1915. His imprisonment acted however to galvanise Czech nationalist opinion against the Austrian state. Kramář's imprisonment sidelined him for much of World War I, and allowed his rival Masaryk who was in London at the time to become the public face of the Czech independence movement. On 3 June 1916, Kramář was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. In March 1917, when waiting on death row in prison, Kramář heard of the February Revolution in Russia, which marked the end of his dream that after the war a Romanov would sit on the throne of a restored Bohemian kingdom. Kramář's cellmate Alois Rašín remarked \\"We are finished!\\". The new Austrian Emperor Karl I released Kramář as part of a general political amnesty in 1917. On 13 July 1918 Kramář founded the Czechoslovak National Committee in Prague, in which all the Czech political parties were represented to work for independence from Austria. On 28 October 1918, Kramář had the National Committee issue a declaration in Prague announcing \\"The independent Czechoslovak state has come into being\\" and the long centuries of rule by the House of Habsburg over the Czechs had now ended. For the first two days a standoff ensured as the Austrian authorities proclaimed martial law and ordered the arrest of National Committee leaders, but the unwillingness of the troops of the Prague garrison, consisting mostly of ethnic Hungarians and Romanians from Transylvania, to obey orders ensured the Czechs triumphed peacefully. The soldiers had little desire to fight for the collapsing Austrian empire and many of the troops from Transylvania allowed themselves to be draped in the new Czechoslovak flag as they fraternized with the people of Prague. Independence On 31 October, Kramář, who had gone to Geneva to meet with Beneš, representing the Paris-based National Council, concluded that a new Czechoslovak state would be a parliamentary republic with Masaryk as president, Kramář as premier and Beneš as foreign minister. Kramář was impressed with Beneš's skills as a diplomat, reporting to Prague: \\"If you saw our Dr. Beneš and his mastery of global questions...you would take off your hat and say it was truly marvelous!\\" Masaryk, was in the United States lobbying for American support for Czechoslovakia when was named president, and as such, Kramář as the premier in Prague was largely the man who ran Czechoslovakia in its first months. Formerly a close associate of Masaryk, later the first president of Czechoslovakia, the two had been barely on speaking terms by 1914. Kramář, as the most prominent politician in Czechoslovakia, was named the country's first prime minister (14 November 1918 – 8 July 1919), much to the displeasure of Masaryk. In January 1919, the Polish–Czechoslovak War between Poland and Czechoslovakia began over the Duchy of Teschen. The Teschen region, which had a Polish majority and a Czech minority, was very rich in coal. However, the main reason that Kramář gave the Poles an ultimatum, demanding their withdrawal from Teschen, was to strengthen the Czechoslovak claim on the Sudetenland. To allow Teschen to join Poland because it had a Polish majority would create a precedent for the German- speaking Sudetenland to join Germany. Like other Czech politicians, Kramář insisted on the indivisibility of the former Austrian crownlands of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, arguing that everything that was once part of the Austrian Empire's \\"Czech lands\\" was now part of Czechoslovakia, and maintaining the claim on the Sudetenland that led Kramář to insist so forcefully that Teschen was part of Czechoslovakia. In first months of Czechoslovakia, wages in the cities fell by 60% in real terms owing to inflation and 350,000 workers, making up 8% of the population were unemployed. Inflation was a major problem in the first months of the new republic, all the more so as Czechoslovakia continued to use the old Habsburg notes, in common with other former nations of the Habsburg Empire, which printed their notes in abandon, in a sense \\"exporting\\" their inflation. In February 1919, a degree ordered that only Habsburg notes stamped with the Czechoslovak lion were legal tender, and in April 1919, the Czechoslovak crown was introduced as the new currency. The February degree largely ended the inflation that was threatening the economical destabilisation of Czechoslovakia. Within the new state, about 150 families owned a tenth of all the land, but half of Czech farmers owned only a half a hectare, and two-thirds Slovak peasant families were landless. In April 1919, Kramář issued a land reform act that limited the amount of land any farmer could own to 150 hectares, thus breaking up all large estates, owned mostly by the German-speaking and Hungarian-speaking nobility. The land was redistributed to smallholders and landless farm labourers. Even Kramář's opponent Masaryk called the land reform act \\"the greatest act of the new republic\\", as it stabilised the countryside, creating a class of small farmers who owned the land they worked and contributed to the subsequent political stability of Czechoslovakia in the 1920s. In an attack on the power of the aristocracy, which Kramář viewed as \\"foreign\\" because they usually spoke German or Hungarian, all titles of nobility were abolished in the new republic. In an attempt to ward off the appeal of the left, another degree established 8 hours as the maximum that could be worked on a single day, thus giving to one of the key demands of the trade union movement. In May 1919, an anarchist, Alois Šťastný, made an unsuccessful attempt to kill Kramář. Once independence had been won, Kramář's National Democrat Party, whose supporters were mostly conservative and middle-class, had lost much of its raison d'être. The conservative Kramář was out of touch with the left-leaning mood of the voters, and because he was in Paris for the first months of 1919, credit for his reforms went to his finance minister, Alois Rašin, and Antonín Švehla. Kramář, a strong Russophile who was married to a Russian, represented Czechoslovakia at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 but resigned over Foreign Minister Beneš's failure to support anticommunst forces in Russia. Kramář wanted to keep the Czechoslovak Legions fighting in the Russian Civil War until all of Russia was \\"liberated\\" from the Bolsheviks, arguing the Czechoslovak Legion should be headed towards Moscow, not Vladivostok. Kramář further believed that once all of Russia came under the rule of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, a \\"Slavic federation\\" would be created uniting Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia together. Both Masaryk and his protégée Beneš saw Kramář as the main danger to Czechoslovak democracy, regarding him as a \\"reactionary\\" Czech chauvinist who was opposed to their plans for Czechoslovakia as a multicultural, multiethnic state. Masaryk and Beneš both doubted Kramář's commitment to \\"Western values\\" such as democracy, enlightenment, rationality and tolerance, seeing him as a romantic Pan- Slavist, who looked towards the east rather the west for ideas, which meant the weight of \\"the Hrad\\" (\\"the castle\\"), as Czechs called the presidency, was thrown to marginalize Kramář as a political force. Kramář resented the way in which Masaryk openly groomed Beneš as his successor, noting that Masaryk put in articles into the constitution saying the age limit for senators was 45, but the age limit for the presidency was 35, which conveniently made Beneš eligible for the presidency. The charge of Czech chauvinism against Kramář had some substance, as he openly proclaimed his belief that the Czechs should be the dominant people in Czechoslovakia, denounced Masaryk and Beneš for their belief that the Sudeten Germans should be equal to the Czechs and made it clear his opposition to having German as one of the official languages of Czechoslovakia. After the first general election in Czechoslovakia, Kramář's party, now the National Democratic Party, became a minor player in the various interwar governments of the new state. Later, Kramář worked together with Jiří Stříbrný and František Mareš in the National Union (Národní sjednocení). As part of their effort to marginalise Kramář, Masaryk and Beneš started to promote a historical narrative that portrayed \\"the resistance abroad\\" in the war as the \\"true\\" liberators and the founders of the republic, and the \\"domestic resistance\\" were disparaged as collaborators with the House of Habsburg. In what became known as the Boj legendistů (\\"the battle of the legend makers\\"), until the 1920s Kramář and his allies fought Masaryk and Beneš in a war of words in the press over who was the \\"true\\" founders of Czechoslovakia. The Boj legendistů began in 1922, when Kramář published his book Five Lectures on Foreign Affairs. An extremely hostile book review of Five Lectures on Foreign Affairs was published in the newspaper Čas under the initials V.S., but it was quickly realised the author was Masaryk. A number of articles were subsequently published in which Masaryk accused \\"the domestic resistance\\" of having done nothing of note during the war, and he accused Kramář of still being loyal to the House of Habsburg as late of 1919, taking out of context Kramář's remark at the Paris Peace Conference that he was still a monarchist at heart. Masaryk further argued, based on the memoirs of Count Maximilian von Coundenhove, the Austrian commander in Prague in 1918, that the work of the \\"domestic resistance\\" in proclaiming Czechoslovak independence on 28 October 1918 had been ineffective and implied that Kramář was actually working with Coundenhove to preserve Austrian rule over the Czech lands. Writing in 2009, the American historian Andrea Orzoff wrote that the extent that Kramář lost the Boj legendistů of the 1920s could be seen even today since most Czechs still revere Masaryk as the \\"President-Liberator\\" and, to a lesser extent, the memory of Beneš is still venerated, but Kramář has largely been forgotten in popular memory. During his time in the National Assembly (1918–1937), Kramář worked in the Committee for Foreign Affairs and made many speeches on foreign policy. Kramář developed a system of dividing countries into popular and unpopular nations. Countries such as the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire were in the popular category. On the other hand, Germany, the Soviet Union and Hungary were in the unpopular category.Georgiev, J., Kysela, J. (ed.): Kapitoly z dějin stavovského a parlamentního zřízení (Chapters from the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions), Praha 2004, s. 149 – 169 – vyšlo v roce 2005. =Views on Bolshevism and the Soviet Union= Kramář saw Bolshevism as a dangerous German creation and believed that they would remain loyal to Germany. He also consistently rejected the idea of centralised production and the utopian vision of a classless society. Still, Kramář doubted the long-term viability of Bolshevism, which he thought was unpopular and maintained only through terror. He sincerely hoped that the Soviet Union would collapse during his lifetime.

The park also attracts bird-watchers with the chance of seeing herons, egrets and, possibly, bald eagles. The park is home to the Kirbo Interpretive Center, which teaches visitors about Native Americans and displays snakes, turtles, fish, and other artifacts from prehistoric times to the early 20th century. Located just southeast of the park is Providence Canyon State Outdoor Recreation Area. History The park is on the site of the frontier town of Florence, which was originally named Liverpool, after the English port city. Florence was a prosperous town with a covered bridge linking it to Alabama, a newspaper, bank and hotel. The town went into decline after a flood washed away the bridge in 1846 and the town was bypassed by the railroad. Florence was officially incorporated as a town from 1837 until 1995.

Together with the islands Changxing and Hengsha, it forms Chongming County, the northernmost area of the provincial-level municipality of Shanghai. At the time of the 2010 Chinese census, its population was . A stretch of the north shore of the island is not part of Chongming County or Shanghai but are instead two pene- exclaves of Jiangsu, formed by the connection of Chongming to the formerly- separate island of Yonglongsha. Name The island is named for Chongming, an early settlement on the island of Xisha that was named for its placement on relatively high and clear ground. History Present-day Chongming first developed as two separate shoals--Xisha and Dongsha--during the Wude Era ( 618-626) of the Tang dynasty. These were initially about apart and located south of the larger island of Dongbuzhou (t , s , p Dōngbùzhōu), which came to form part of the peninsula of Qidong in Jiangsu. Xisha was also known as Gujunsha. By the first year of Shenlong (705), a town was established on Xisha which was known as \\"Chongming\\". The number, size, and shapes of the islands fluctuated repeatedly over time and with the floods of the Yangtze: In the 3rd year of Tiansheng (1025), a new island arose a little to the northwest of Dongsha which became known as Yaoliusha from the surnames of its early settlers. In the first year of Jiangzhong Jingguo (1101), Sansha rose for the third time, stabilizing 50 Chinese miles northwest of Yaoliusha. During the 12th- and 13th-century Yuan dynasty, Yingqiansha, Matuosha, Zhangpusha, and around six other islands also formed. The early settlers of these islands were mostly fishermen and salt collectors, with their principal saltern at Tianci. In the 14th year of Zhiyuan (1277) under Kublai Khan of the Yuan, was organized within Yangzhou. Owing to the shifting sands of the islands, however, the county seat needed to be repeatedly moved.\\"Chongming Island\\" in the Encyclopedia of Shanghai, p. 52. During the late Yuan and early Ming, the sparsely-inhabited shoals of the area began to fill with migrants from Pudong and other areas of Songjiang Prefecture. These immigrants introduced cotton cultivation, which spread widely prior to China's opening to international trade in the later Qing. There was small-scale textile production in the area, but most of the cotton was exported for use in Songjiang, Hangzhou, and other more developed areas of Jiangnan.Walker, Kathy Le Mons. \\"The View from the Periphery: Tongzhou and the Northern Delta\\" in Chinese Modernity and the Peasant Path: Semicolonialism in the Northern Yangzi Delta, pp. 52 ff. Stanford University Press (Stanford), 1999. In the 2nd year of Hongwu (1396) under the Ming, the prefecture was downgraded to a county but, shortly afterwards, a major subsidence--sinking the entirety of Dongsha and most of Xisha--provoked a mass emigration back to the mainland. Around the same time, however, Sansha expanded towards the north while Yaoliusha simultaneously eroded in the south while building up in the north, \\"migrating\\" it towards Sansha. Chongming County was later placed in Suzhou and then Taicang Prefectures. Over the course of the Ming, numerous shoals arose in succession: Ma'ansha, Chen'ensha, Gaomingsha, Xiaoyinsha, Changsha, Yuanjiasha, Xiangsha, Gaotousha, and around 20 others. Over the two hundred years from the beginning of Jiajing (1522) under the Ming to the end of Kangxi (1722) under the Qing, these shoals frequently flooded or collapsed back into the river. Yaoliusha and Sansha eroded away; Xisha, Chenensha, Fanliansha, and others sank. In the west, Pingyangsha arose, then sank, then finally merged with nearby Yuanjiasha, Wujiasha, Xiangsha, and Nansha. Around the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644, these islands were merged all the way to Gaotousha in the west, forming a single mass 200 Chinese miles east to west by 40 north to south. Their unification with remaining nearby islands by 1681 effectively created present-day Chongming, although it remained much smaller at the time. Between the Shunzhi and Kangxi Eras (1644-1722), Rilongsha, Yongansha, Ping'ansha, Dongsansha, and around 25 others arose without sinking. Under the Republic, it was organized first under the Nantong and then Songjiang Special Administration District.

The island has an average elevation of above sea level, with the northwest and central areas somewhat higher than the southwest and eastern ones. =Location= Chongming is located in the Yangtze River, dividing the river into northern and southern channels immediately prior to its entrance into the East China Sea. The island forms the northernmost part of the municipality of Shanghai, separated by the Yangtze from Baoshan and Pudong New Area, which face each other across the mouth of the Huangpu. In Jiangsu, most of Haimen and Qidong are separated from Chongming by the northern channel of the Yangtze; Taicang County, meanwhile, lies across the southern channel next to Shanghai's Baoshan District.

It covers 220 km2 and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone. In 2004, the park was being considered for expansion in order to create a corridor from the border with Laos to the sea. The park can be accessed by foot, moped or with a park guide's car. History In 1932, the summit of Bạch Mã was selected by the French engineer Girard to become a hill station for the colonial administration of Hue. In the following years, a village including 139 villas and hotels was created. To accommodate holidaymakers and to avoid commuting on the steep, road to the next major town, there was a post office, a market, and a hospital. By 1937 the number of holiday homes had reached 139 and it became known as the \\"Dalat of central Vietnam\\". Most of the visitors were high- ranking French VIPs. Not surprisingly the Viet Minh tried hard to spoil the holiday – the area saw some heavy fighting in the early 1950s. After independence from the French, Bạch Mã was soon forgotten and the villas abandoned; today they are in total ruin and only a few stone walls remain. At an elevation of 1250 meters above sea level, the national park is a popular summer retreat for the Vietnamese, who come to feel the relief of the cooler temperatures of Bạch Mã. The area around Bach Ma was first protected as a series of forest reserves in 1937 and was declared a protected area by the government of South Vietnam in 1962. In 1986 the area was established as a national park. The forests of the park, like Cát Tiên National Park, suffered from the use of defoliants like Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Biodiversity of Bạch Mã Bạch Mã National Park is situated in the Annamite Mountains and is one of the wettest places in Vietnam. Its mountains are composed mainly of granite, and the topography of the park is generally very steep. Bạch Mã's position, at the biogeographical border between northern and southern Vietnam, combined with its variety of habitats, ranging from the coast to high mountains, means the park is rich in biodiversity. It is located in an area that is considered a centre of plant diversity in Vietnam. The main vegetation type is moist evergreen and montane forest, as well as areas of scrub and grassland where human disturbance has been high. The mammals of the park are not well known, though historically it held important species such as the Asian elephant, white-cheeked gibbon and red-shanked douc langur. It also protects important bird species, especially Vietnamese endemics such as the crested argus, Annam partridge and Edwards's pheasant, which had been thought extinct.

They are typically made of rigid materials such as asphalt or concrete, and covered with acrylic resins to seal the surface and mark the playing lines, while providing some cushioning. Historically, hardwood surfaces were also in use in indoor settings, similar to an indoor basketball court, but these surfaces are rare now. Tennis Tennis hard courts are made of synthetic/acrylic layers on top of a concrete or asphalt foundation and can vary in color. These courts tend to play medium-fast to fast because there is little energy absorption by the court, like in grass courts. The ball tends to bounce high and players are able to apply many types of spin during play. Flat balls are favored on hard courts because of the extremely quick play style. Speed of rebound after tennis balls bounce on hard courts is determined by how much sand is in the synthetic/acrylic layer placed on top of the asphalt foundation. More sand will result in a slower bounce due to more friction. Of the Grand Slam tournaments, the US Open and Australian Open currently use hard courts and it is the predominant surface type used on the professional tour. =Maintenance= There are numerous hardcourt maintenance methods which are commonly used to keep these facilities in top condition. Some of these include brushing, pressure washing with a cleaning solution and applying chemical treatments to prevent the growth of moss and algae. Anti-slip paint is also applied to hardcourts to give better playing qualities which enhance player safety and performance.

It is used for many different types of sports and has recently received significant investment which has enabled a major refurbishment of existing facilities as well as introduction of new facilities. Run by Serco on behalf of Nottinghamshire County Council, it was previously one of five National Sports Centres, and is a unique sporting venue set in the centre of the country. History The centre was constructed during 1970 and 1971 on a former gravel works and required the excavation of one and a half million cubic yards of material. The centre opened in 1971 and won second prize in the 1972 Times/RICS Conservation Awards and was consequently chosen to host the first National Rowing Championships in 1972.  Facilities  Set in of parkland, Holme Pierrepont Country Park not only offers a host of water activities, but also a range of land based activities. The centre is made up of three distinct pieces of water: * Regatta lake, a 2,000 metre regatta rowing facility which features a six lane rowing course * A 700 m purpose- built white water canoe slalom course * A water ski lagoon equipped with ski jump as well as a ski cableway. Further, the River Trent is also accessible from the site. = Outdoor Adventure Park = Holme Pierrepont Country Park also has an Outdoor Adventure Park, formerly known as the Family Fun Park, located in the Country Park area of the site. Opened in 2014, which includes: ( * Please note that all activities come with health and safety restrictions * ) * Sky Trail High Ropes Course * Mini Golf * Segways * Climbing Wall * Children's Play Area * Pay and Play Archery Combat * Country Park Café Visit the website for more : https://www.nwscnotts.com/ = Skytrail and Sky Tykes = The Skytrail is a high ropes course that allows participants to challenge themselves to cross a multitude of obstacles on two levels without needing to be detached at any point. Sky Tykes is a miniature version for smaller children. = Archery Combat = The site introduced an outdoor archery combat game in 2019, which involves teams competing against each other with bows and rubber tipped arrows on an all-weather battlefield. = Segway = Holme Pierrepont also offers beginner segway sessions on a purpose built track in a wooded area featuring tight corners and inclines. = Mini Golf = Beneath the Skytrail sits a 9- hole mini golf course that increases in difficulty with each hole. = Climbing Wall = A 10 meter climbing wall with four side offers both a challenge to climbers of all abilities and a phenomenal view of the river. = Gym = There are two new gyms which were opened in 2014 - these include a 60 station Life Fitness gym which overlooks the Regatta Lake and a specific Strength and Conditioning gym. Equipment includes: * The New Life Fitness Discovery Range * Resistance Equipment from Life Fitness’ Premium Signature Range * Power Plate * Life Fitness – Synrgy360 Functional Training * Trixter Virtual Training Bikes * SpeedStroke Kayak Simulator * Squat Rack * 2 x Olympic Lifting Platforms * Free Weights * Benches * Assisted Chin Dip = Accommodation = The site has 54 refurbished en-suite bedrooms in the main Lakeside building, as well as a self-contained cottage called The Elms, which sleeps up to 11 people. The site also has an 18-acre campsite containing a mixture of grass and hard standing pitches, some available with electric hook up, 5 Tipi's (introduced in 2016) and 10 Camping Arches (insulated wooden huts for camping in). = Conferencing Facilities = The centre offers conference and meeting facilities and has four refurbished conference rooms, with the largest room catering for up to 150 people. Holme Pierrepont Country Park also offers team building activities alongside their conferencing packages.  Courses  The facilities provide a full range of award courses in: sailing, canoeing, kayaking, powerboat handling, and raft guide training. A sports science and medicine centre, ran by the English Institute of Sport, is purpose built and is available for use by governing bodies for physiology, sports injury/rehabilitation and physiological testing.  Whitewater course  The course is a focal point for English whitewater rafting and kayaking, often holding international events for slalom, freestyle and wild water racing. One hosted event is the National Student Rodeo, the largest freestyle kayaking event in the world. During this event the Centre received coverage in local news, and publications such as Canoe & Kayak UK magazine. = Location = The whitewater course is located between the weir on the canalised River Trent and the regatta lake. = Construction = Built in 1986, the course is made primarily from concrete. It is approximately 1500 metres long, drops just over 4 metres in height to produce Grade 3 whitewater rapids. The course is gravity fed, does not use electricity to power it, and therefore is relatively cheap to run. Due to the nature of the design, swimming through the course is safer than many other locations around the UK due to deep channels and few significant underwater obstructions. The amount of water flowing through the course depends on rainfall, and canal usage, but due to the large catchment of the Trent, flows between 16 and 25 cubic metres per second are common. The course closes more frequently due to excessively high flows (generally in winter) than it does due to a lack of water. The course was renovated in 2009. Along with essential maintenance work, some of the original concrete obstacles were removed and Omniflots (large plastic movable blocks) were installed.  Sports  Holme Pierrepont Country Park, home of The National Water Sports Centre, is home of British Canoeing, the national governing body for canoeing and kayaking in the UK, whose headquarters are at the site. The Holme Pierrepont Canoe Club gives lessons on the flat water lake and the course, which is also used for water safety and water rescue training. It also hosts rafting, playboating, slalom; kayaking plus squirt boaters, open boat canoeists and wild water racing. One of the main sports held at the centre is rowing, using the 2000 metre multi-lane rowing lake. The Centre was the venue for the World Rowing Junior Championships in 1973, and for the World Rowing Championships in 1975 and 1986, and many major competitions for UK rowing. Typically the safety is outsourced to local lifeguard unit Colwick Park Lifeguards who have been part of the team at Holme Pierrepont since 1979. The centre is also the venue for many Triathlon events, including the Outlaw Half and Full Triathlons. The full triathlon sees over 1100 athletes from all over the world taking on a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run. The centre is the base for the Holme Pierrepont Running Club. The centre was chosen to host the Sea Scout 100 national Sea Scout Centenary Jamboree in August 2009. Over 3000 Sea Scouts attended including the USA and New Zealand.

An updated version with greater range, the R-24, replaced it in service. It is comparable to the American AIM-7 Sparrow, both in terms of overall performance as well as role. Development Design of a new missile to arm the MiG-23 fighter started in the mid-1960s under the direction of V.A. Pustyakov's design team. Known as the K-23 during its design, the new weapon was intended for use against bomber-sized targets, with \\"snap-up\\" capability to attack targets at higher altitude than the launch aircraft. It originally was intended to have a dual-mode seeker using both semi-active radar homing (SARH) and infrared (IR) guidance, but this proved unfeasible, and separate SARH and IR models (Izdeliye (Product) 340 and 360, respectively) were developed instead. Test firings were carried out in 1967, although the SARH missile's seeker head proved to be extremely problematic. In 1968 the Soviets acquired an AIM-7 and a Vympel team started copying it as the K-25. A comparison of the two led to the K-23 entering production, based largely on its better range and countermeasures resistance. The K-25 work ended in 1971. Nevertheless, several features of the Sparrow were later used in the Vympel R-27 design. The missile, designated R-23, entered service in January 1974, the SARH version as the R-23R, the IR version R-23T. The R-23R, weighing , used a monopulse radar which gave it better ECM resistance compared to the AIM-7E-2. The R-23T was lighter at and used a liquid nitrogen-cooled infrared seeker which required it be locked on to the target before launching, either by the launching aircraft's radar or IRST. Both versions used the same radar fused warhead, which had a lethal radius of and could bring down bomber-sized targets.Mladenov (2016), Third Generation - 'Flogger' Air-to-Air Missiles In the west these were known as the AA-7A and AA-7B, respectively. An inert training round, the R-23UT, was also developed. The airframe featured four delta wings arranged cruciform just behind the midpoint of the fuselage, and cropped-delta control surfaces at the extreme rear in-line with the wings. Smaller cropped-triangular surfaces are mounted in-line near the nose : known as \\"destabilizers\\", they serve to improve the rudders' efficiency at high angles of attack (the R-60 missile uses the same feature). The only external difference between the two versions was the nose cone, which was an ogive for the SARH seeker, and shorter (by 30 cm) and more rounded for the IR version. The R-23 had a probability of kill of 0.8-0.9, though it could not hit a target pulling more than 5g. The launching aircraft was also limited to 4g when it wished to fire the missile. The infrared R-23T had a minimum launch range of 4 km against a target that was head-on, but only 1.3 km against a target when it had a view of its rear. Its maximum range also depended on the target's facing in addition to the launcher's altitude: a low altitudes this was 11 km against a forward-facing target and 8-10 km against a rear-facing target; at high altitudes it was 11 km and 4 km respectively. The radar-guided R-23R had similar minimum launch ranges, but much greater maximum ranges: 14 km and 4 km against a forward- or rear-facing target at low altitudes, and 25 km and 8-10 km respectively at high altitudes. Large numbers of R-23s were built, both by Molniya (ex OKB-4) as well as Vympel (ex OKB-134). Starting in 1975 an improved version of the weapon was developed to arm the MiG-23ML/MLD, entering service as the R-24 in 1981. Both SARH and IR variants were heavier at and featured a larger warhead with a lethal radius of . The warhead also had a more reliable radar fuse, which greatly reduced the minimum range to for a rear-quarter engagement and for a head-on attack. Both could also be launched by and against fighter-sized targets maneuvering at 7g. The SARH R-24R featured a RGS-24 seeker head with superior ECM resistance and lock-on- after-launch capability, which avoided interference from the launching aircraft's own radar as the missile passed by its nose. This feature, along with a larger rocket motor and a lengthening of the missile's inertial phase of flight, gave it a 30% longer range than its predecessor: 17 km and 4 km against a forward or rear-facing target at low altitudes, and 35 km and 20 km respectively at high altitudes. The missile could hit targets at altitudes of and even glide into helicopters which were hovering. The IR R-24T had a much improved TGS-23T4 seeker with greater sensitivity, but still required lock-on before it could be launched. At low altitudes its maximum range was similar to the R-23, but at high altitudes could be used against a rear-facing target from 20 km and 12 km when head-on. The missiles were known officially as izdeliye (Product) 140 and 160 in the USSR, and AA-7C and AA-7D in the west. The R-23/24 was also produced under license in Romania as the A-911/A901. The R-24 remained in at least limited Russian service until the withdrawal of the last Russian MiG-23s in 1997. Combat record =Syria= The R-23 was used in the Beqaa Valley in June 1982, during the 1982 Lebanon War. However, it is hard to judge its success. Soviet and Syrian sources claim that it achieved a few kills while the Israelis deny this. According to Austrian researcher Tom Cooper, Syrian claims include using the R-23/24 against six F-16As and one E-2C, however, the only confirmed kill is against a BQM-34 drone. During the Syrian civil war Syrian MiG-23s used R-24R missiles to shot down 2 Jordanian Selex ES Falcos in the vicinity of Daraa province on 15-16 June 2017.Drones Are Dropping Like Flies From the Sky Over Syria Shoot-downs are becoming commonplace. Tom Cooper. June 22, 2017 =Iraq= Many R-23 kills are reported in the war between Iran and Iraq when Iraqi MiG-23s fired them at Iranian F-14A, F-4D/Es and F-5Es. =Angola= On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, an attempt was mounted to intercept two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs. Captain Arthur Piercy's F1CZ was damaged by either an R-24 or R-60 AAM fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft's drag chute and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy's ejection seat to fire, but he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries. =Soviet Union= On 28 September 1988, two Soviet MiG-23MLDs piloted by Vladmir Astakhov and Boris Gavrilov shot down two Iranian AH-1J Cobras that had trespassed into Afghan airspace using R-24s.

It is the primary component of rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil. It is a colorless oil, although commercial samples can appear yellow. It has low solubility in water, but it is soluble in common organic solvents. The functional group derived from geraniol (in essence, geraniol lacking the terminal −OH) is called geranyl. Uses and occurrence In addition to rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil, it also occurs in small quantities in geranium, lemon, and many other essential oils. With a rose-like scent, it is commonly used in perfumes. It is used in flavors such as peach, raspberry, grapefruit, red apple, plum, lime, orange, lemon, watermelon, pineapple, and blueberry. Geraniol is produced by the scent glands of honeybees to mark nectar-bearing flowers and locate the entrances to their hives. It is also commonly used as an insect repellent, especially for mosquitoes. It is a byproduct of the metabolism of sorbate and, thus, is a very unpleasant contaminant of wine if bacteria are allowed to grow in it.  Biochemistry  Geraniol is important in biosynthesis of other terpenes. For example, myrcene and ocimene are formed by dehydration and isomerization of geraniol.  Reactions  In acidic solutions, geraniol is converted to the cyclic terpene α-terpineol. The alcohol group undergoes expected reactions. It can be converted to the chloride with thionyl chloride. It can be hydrogenated. It can be oxidized to the aldehyde geranial.

The Wiener filter minimizes the mean square error between the estimated random process and the desired process. Description The goal of the Wiener filter is to compute a statistical estimate of an unknown signal using a related signal as an input and filtering that known signal to produce the estimate as an output. For example, the known signal might consist of an unknown signal of interest that has been corrupted by additive noise. The Wiener filter can be used to filter out the noise from the corrupted signal to provide an estimate of the underlying signal of interest. The Wiener filter is based on a statistical approach, and a more statistical account of the theory is given in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator article. Typical deterministic filters are designed for a desired frequency response. However, the design of the Wiener filter takes a different approach. One is assumed to have knowledge of the spectral properties of the original signal and the noise, and one seeks the linear time-invariant filter whose output would come as close to the original signal as possible. Wiener filters are characterized by the following: # Assumption: signal and (additive) noise are stationary linear stochastic processes with known spectral characteristics or known autocorrelation and cross-correlation # Requirement: the filter must be physically realizable/causal (this requirement can be dropped, resulting in a non-causal solution) # Performance criterion: minimum mean-square error (MMSE) This filter is frequently used in the process of deconvolution; for this application, see Wiener deconvolution. Wiener filter solutions Let s(t) be an unknown signal which must be estimated from a measurement signal x(t). The Wiener filter problem has solutions for three possible cases: one where a noncausal filter is acceptable (requiring an infinite amount of both past and future data), the case where a causal filter is desired (using an infinite amount of past data), and the finite impulse response (FIR) case where only input data is used (i.e. the result or output is not fed back into the filter as in the IIR case). The first case is simple to solve but is not suited for real-time applications. Wiener's main accomplishment was solving the case where the causality requirement is in effect; Norman Levinson gave the FIR solution in an appendix of Wiener's book. =Noncausal solution= :G(s) = frac{S_{x,s}(s)}{S_x(s)}e^{alpha s}, where S are spectral densities. Provided that g(t) is optimal, then the minimum mean-square error equation reduces to :E(e^2) = R_s(0) - int_{-infty}^{infty} g(tau)R_{x,s}(tau + alpha),dtau, and the solution g(t) is the inverse two-sided Laplace transform of G(s). =Causal solution= :G(s) = frac{H(s)}{S_x^{+}(s)}, where * H(s) consists of the causal part of frac{S_{x,s}(s)}{S_x^{-}(s)}e^{alpha s} (that is, that part of this fraction having a positive time solution under the inverse Laplace transform) * S_x^{+}(s) is the causal component of S_x(s) (i.e., the inverse Laplace transform of S_x^{+}(s) is non-zero only for t ge 0) * S_x^{-}(s) is the anti-causal component of S_x(s) (i.e., the inverse Laplace transform of S_x^{-}(s) is non-zero only for t < 0) This general formula is complicated and deserves a more detailed explanation. To write down the solution G(s) in a specific case, one should follow these steps: # Start with the spectrum S_x(s) in rational form and factor it into causal and anti-causal components: S_x(s) = S_x^{+}(s) S_x^{-}(s) where S^{+} contains all the zeros and poles in the left half plane (LHP) and S^{-} contains the zeroes and poles in the right half plane (RHP). This is called the Wiener–Hopf factorization. # Divide S_{x,s}(s)e^{alpha s} by S_x^{-}(s) and write out the result as a partial fraction expansion. # Select only those terms in this expansion having poles in the LHP. Call these terms H(s). # Divide H(s) by S_x^{+}(s). The result is the desired filter transfer function G(s). Finite impulse response Wiener filter for discrete series Block diagram view of the FIR Wiener filter for discrete series. An input signal w[n] is convolved with the Wiener filter g[n] and the result is compared to a reference signal s[n] to obtain the filtering error e[n]. The causal finite impulse response (FIR) Wiener filter, instead of using some given data matrix X and output vector Y, finds optimal tap weights by using the statistics of the input and output signals. It populates the input matrix X with estimates of the auto-correlation of the input signal (T) and populates the output vector Y with estimates of the cross-correlation between the output and input signals (V). In order to derive the coefficients of the Wiener filter, consider the signal w[n] being fed to a Wiener filter of order (number of past taps) N and with coefficients {a_0, cdots, a_N}. The output of the filter is denoted x[n] which is given by the expression :x[n] = sum_{i=0}^N a_i w[n-i] . The residual error is denoted e[n] and is defined as e[n] = x[n] − s[n] (see the corresponding block diagram). The Wiener filter is designed so as to minimize the mean square error (MMSE criteria) which can be stated concisely as follows: :a_i = arg min E left [e^2[n] right ], where E[cdot] denotes the expectation operator. In the general case, the coefficients a_i may be complex and may be derived for the case where w[n] and s[n] are complex as well. With a complex signal, the matrix to be solved is a Hermitian Toeplitz matrix, rather than symmetric Toeplitz matrix. For simplicity, the following considers only the case where all these quantities are real. The mean square error (MSE) may be rewritten as: :begin{align} E left [e^2[n] right ] &= E left [ (x[n]-s[n])^2 right ] &= E left [ x^2[n] right ] + E left [s^2[n] right ] - 2E[x[n]s[n  &= E left [ left ( sum_{i=0}^N a_i w[n-i] right)^2right ] + E left [s^2[n] right ] - 2Eleft [sum_{i=0}^N a_i w[n-i]s[n] right ] end{align} To find the vector [a_0,, ldots,, a_N] which minimizes the expression above, calculate its derivative with respect to each a_i :begin{align} frac{partial}{partial a_i} E left [e^2[n] right ] &= frac{partial}{partial a_i} left { E left [ left ( sum_{i=0}^N a_i w[n-i] right)^2right ] + E left [s^2[n] right ] - 2Eleft [sum_{i=0}^N a_i w[n-i]s[n] right ]right }  &= 2Eleft [ left ( sum_{j=0}^N a_j w[n-j] right ) w[n-i] right ] - 2E [w[n-i]s[n  &= 2 left ( sum_{j=0}^N E [w[n-j]w[n-i] ] a_j right ) - 2E [ w[n-i]s[n end{align} Assuming that w[n] and s[n] are each stationary and jointly stationary, the sequences R_w[m] and R_{ws}[m] known respectively as the autocorrelation of w[n] and the cross-correlation between w[n] and s[n] can be defined as follows: :begin{align} R_w[m] &= E{w[n]w[n+m]}  R_{ws}[m] &= E{w[n]s[n+m]} end{align} The derivative of the MSE may therefore be rewritten as: :frac{partial}{partial a_i} E left [e^2[n] right ]= 2 left ( sum_{j=0}^{N} R_w[j-i] a_j right ) - 2 R_{ws}[i] qquad i = 0,cdots, N. Note that for real w[n], the autocorrelation is symmetric: R_w[j-i] = R_w[i-j]Letting the derivative be equal to zero results in: :sum_{j=0}^N R_w[j-i] a_j = R_{ws}[i] qquad i = 0,cdots, N. which can be rewritten (using the above symmetric property) in matrix form :underbrace{begin{bmatrix} R_w[0] & R_w[1] & cdots & R_w[N]  R_w[1] & R_w[0] & cdots & R_w[N-1]  vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots  R_w[N] & R_w[N-1] & cdots & R_w[0] end{bmatrix}}_{mathbf{T}} underbrace{begin{bmatrix} a_0  a_1  vdots  a_N end{bmatrix}}_{mathbf{a}} = underbrace{begin{bmatrix} R_{ws}[0] R_{ws}[1]  vdots  R_{ws}[N] end{bmatrix}}_{mathbf{v}} These equations are known as the Wiener–Hopf equations. The matrix T appearing in the equation is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix. Under suitable conditions on R, these matrices are known to be positive definite and therefore non-singular yielding a unique solution to the determination of the Wiener filter coefficient vector, mathbf{a} = mathbf{T}^{-1}mathbf{v}. Furthermore, there exists an efficient algorithm to solve such Wiener–Hopf equations known as the Levinson-Durbin algorithm so an explicit inversion of T is not required. In some articles, the cross correlation function is defined in the opposite way:R_{sw}[m] = E{w[n]s[n+m]}Then, the mathbf{v} matrix will contain R_{sw}[0] ldots R_{sw}[N]; this is just a difference in notation. Whichever notation is used, note that for real w[n], s[n]:R_{sw}[k] = R_{ws}[-k] = Relationship to the least squares filter = The realization of the causal Wiener filter looks a lot like the solution to the least squares estimate, except in the signal processing domain. The least squares solution, for input matrix mathbf{X} and output vector mathbf{y} is :boldsymbol{hatbeta} = (mathbf{X} ^mathbf{T}mathbf{X})^{-1}mathbf{X}^{mathbf{T}}boldsymbol y . The FIR Wiener filter is related to the least mean squares filter, but minimizing the error criterion of the latter does not rely on cross- correlations or auto-correlations. Its solution converges to the Wiener filter solution. = Complex signals = For complex signals, the derivation of the complex Wiener filter is performed by minimizing E left [e[n]^2 right ] =E left [e[n]e^*[n] right ]. This involves computing partial derivatives with respect to both the real and imaginary parts of a_i, and requiring them both to be zero. The resulting Wiener-Hopf equations are: :sum_{j=0}^N R_w[j-i] a_j^* = R_{ws}[i] qquad i = 0,cdots, N. which can be rewritten in matrix form: :underbrace{begin{bmatrix} R_w[0] & R_w^*[1] & cdots & R_w^*[N-1] & R_w^*[N]  R_w[1] & R_w[0] & cdots& R_w^*[N-2] & R_w^*[N-1]  vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  R_w[N-1] & R_w[N-2] & cdots & R_w[0] & R_w^*[1]  R_w[N] & R_w[N-1] & cdots & R_w[1] & R_w[0] end{bmatrix}}_{mathbf{T}} underbrace{begin{bmatrix} a_0^*  a_1^*  vdots a_{N-1}^*  a_N^* end{bmatrix}}_{mathbf{a^*}} = underbrace{begin{bmatrix} R_{ws}[0] R_{ws}[1]  vdots R_{ws}[N-1]  R_{ws}[N] end{bmatrix}}_{mathbf{v}} Note here that:begin{align} R_w[-k] &= R_w^*[k]  R_{sw}[k] &= R_{ws}^*[-k] end{align} The Wiener coefficient vector is then computed as:mathbf{a} = {(mathbf{T}^{-1}mathbf{v})}^* Applications The Wiener filter has a variety of applications in signal processing, image processing, control systems, and digital communications. These applications generally fall into one of four main categories: * System identification * Deconvolution. \\"D. Boulfelfel, R.M. Rangayyan, L.J. Hahn, and R. Kloiber, 1994, \\"Three- dimensional restoration of single photon emission computed tomography images\\", IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 41(5): 1746-1754, October 1994.\\". * Noise reduction * Signal detection For example, the Wiener filter can be used in image processing to remove noise from a picture. For example, using the Mathematica function: \`WienerFilter[image,2]\` on the first image on the right, produces the filtered image below it. Noisy image of astronaut. Noisy image of astronaut after Wiener filter applied. It is commonly used to denoise audio signals, especially speech, as a preprocessor before speech recognition.  History  The filter was proposed by Norbert Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1949. The discrete-time equivalent of Wiener's work was derived independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and published in 1941. Hence the theory is often called the Wiener–Kolmogorov filtering theory (cf. Kriging). The Wiener filter was the first statistically designed filter to be proposed and subsequently gave rise to many others including the Kalman filter.

Other equivalent classifications are: :UIC classification: 1EE1 (also known as German classification and Swiss classification) :Italian and French classification: 150+051 :Turkish classification: 56+56 :Swiss classification: 5/6+5/6 The equivalent UIC classification is refined to (1′E)E1′ for Mallet locomotives. All 2-10-10-2 locomotives have been articulated locomotives, Mallet locomotives in particular. This wheel arrangement was rare. Only two classes of 2-10-10-2 locomotives have been built; the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's 3000 class, and the Virginian Railway's class AE. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe 3000 class unfortunately performed poorly, and therefore were rebuilt back to the original 2-10-2s they came from between 1915-1918, after only being in service for approximately 3-7 years. None of these survived into preservation. The Virginian Railway Class AE were much more successful, providing between 25-31 years of service, where some were scrapped from 1943-1945, and the rest were scrapped from 1947 to 1949 . None were preserved.  ATSF 3000 class  This class of ten 2-10-10-2 locomotives were actually rebuilt from more conventional 2-10-2 Baldwin-built locomotives by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1911 to 1912. Although they appeared to have exceedingly long boilers, the barrel in front of the rear set of cylinders actually contained first a primitive firetube superheater for further heating the steam before use; the steam was carried forward from the boiler proper by outside steam pipes as shown in the photograph. Also in this space was a reheater for the high-pressure exhaust before it was fed to the forward low-pressure cylinders. In front of that, there was a feedwater heater, a space where cold water from the tender could be warmed before being injected into the water proper. This worked similarly to the boiler itself; the firetubes passed through the feedwater tank. The ATSF 2-10-10-2's, #3000 class locomotives, were the largest locomotives in the world from 1911 till possibly early 1914. Despite being good for helper service, they could only go 10 to 15mph before losing steam, resulting in the locomotives being rebuilt to 2-10-2s during 1915–1918.  Virginian Railway class AE  These ten locomotives were built in 1918 by ALCO for the Virginian Railway. Overall width was , so they were delivered without their cabs and the front, low- pressure cylinders and were assembled after arrival. The low-pressure cylinders (on centers) were the largest on any US locomotive; the cylinders had to be inclined a few degrees to provide clearance. The boiler was also the largest diameter of any locomotive; Railway Mech Engnr says \\"the outside diameter of the largest course is .\\" but the drawing shows diameter at the rear tube sheet. As seen in the photograph, the tenders were small so they could use the Virginian's existing turntables. This class were compound Mallet locomotives: as well as being articulated between the forward, swinging engine unit and the rear fixed one, they were compound locomotives. The rear, high- pressure cylinders exhausted their steam into the huge front cylinders. Like many compound locomotives, they could be operated in simple mode for starting; reduced-pressure steam could be sent straight from the boiler to the front cylinders at low speed, for maximum tractive effort. Calculated in the usual way the tractive effort was in compound; or in simple for the Virginian locomotives. Unlike some other giant locomotives of the period, the immense boilers could generate enough steam to make them a success on the slow () coal trains for which they were built. They remained in service until the 1940s and could be called the ultimate drag era locomotive. No locomotive example of this type survived into preservation.

The Adansi tribe is the smallest of the two tribes inhabiting the Ashanti Region. The capital of the Adansi tribe is at Fomena. An Adansihene (king of Adansi) is still designated. The Adansi tribe has seven paramountcies namely the capital, Fomena, New Edubiase, Ayaase, Akrokyere (Akrokerri), Akrofuom, Bodwesango and Dompoase. The Adansi tribe is devolved into three local government divisions - Adansi South which has a population of 129,325 and an area of 1,380 square kilometres has the capital at New Edubiase; Adansi North has a population of 235,680, and an area 828 square kilometres and has its capital at Fomena; and Obuasi Municipal which has a population of 175,043 and is the second largest urban settlement in the Ashanti Region and the eight biggest urban settlement in Ghana. Adansi South was once the largest cocoa growing area in the whole of the Ashanti Region.  History  The Adansi tribe stretches from the Pra River to the south to the Asante paramountcy of Bekwai to the north. It is also bound to the south-west by the Twi-speaking Denkyera tribe. According to imminent historian F.K.Buah, the Adansiland is considered the origin of some Akan people. In the 17th century the Adansi were a powerful people who were known for their ability to build beautiful structures. The office of the Akan office of Okyeame (linguist) is said to have originated in Adansi. Obuasi Obuasi is a town in southern Ashanti Region and is the capital of Obuasi Municipal, a district, lying south of Kumasi in the Ashanti Region. Obuasi is the second largest urban settlement in the Ashanti Region and the eight most populous settlement in terms of population, with a population of 200,000 people. It is the largest settlement of the Adansi people, a Twi-speaking Akan tribe that has lived peacefully with the powerful Ashanti people to the north for many centuries. Situated on the railway line from Kumasi to Sekondi, it is known for its Obuasi Gold Mine, now one of the nine largest on Earth, gold having been mined on the site since at least the seventeenth century.

It was the band's third independent release after the end of their contract with Geffen Records, and the first of those to feature new material. The album was released on Latent Recordings in Canada, and on Zoë Records internationally.  Album development  While the Cowboy Junkies were touring to support their live album Waltz Across America, they began working on new material for what would become Open. The Waltz Across America tour lasted nine months, with many breaks in the schedule. During the breaks, sometimes Michael Timmins retreated to his hide-a-way to work on new song material. The band would then add two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing them to evolve on stage. During other breaks, the Cowboy Junkies would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record the material they had created that month. The band had worked in several studios that were sterile and impersonal, and always were on the look-out for a comfortable studio they could relax in, especially one where they could set up the whole band. The Junkies had discovered Chemical when they contributed a song for a Gram Parsons tribute album, and they returned there to record \\"Highway Kind\\" for a Townes Van Zandt tribute album. They found they could set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day, which took away the pressure of trying to complete the songs in a set recording period. Each visit to the studio, the band would record two or three songs at most, and they took the opportunity to re-record songs later as needed. After the band had recorded about fifteen tracks, they listened to their material, and decided they had the songs for their next album. Not all the songs were recorded in Chemical. Two of the songs were recorded at Peter Moore's home studio. Those two songs required a greater amount of technical control, which is why the Cowboy Junkies turned to Moore. When the band had captured all the tracks for the album, they edited and sequenced the tracks into a cohesive whole, starting very dark with \\"I Did It All for You\\", rising throughout the album to end with a glimmer of hope with \\"Close My Eyes\\", only to bring back some of the dark with a reprise of the opening feedback. The title of the album, Open, has dual meanings. One meaning is being open in a way that is dangerous, and the other meaning is the beneficial idea of open arms, open smile. Perennial art director David Houghton used an image of a venus flytrap to express both meanings. The plant is wide open, ready to catch its prey, being both open and threatening. The Cowboy Junkies also explore, defining and re-defining the meaning of open through their music.

Evidence of their habitation has also been found in northern West Virginia and portions of southwestern Pennsylvania, which could be reached via the gaps of the Allegheny or several counties to the south, via the Cumberland Narrows pass which held the Nemacolin Trail. Both passes abutted their range and could be reached through connecting valleys from the West Branch Susquehanna and their large settlement at Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Language Conestoga (Susquehannock) was an Iroquoian-speaking people, this fact may indicate they were at odds with the Algonquian-speaking Lënape (Delaware people) to the east. Little of the Conestoga language has been preserved in print. The chief source is a Vocabula Mahakuassica compiled by the Swedish missionary Johannes Campanius during the 1640s. Campanius' vocabulary contains about 100 words, and is sufficient to show that the Conestoga language is a Northern Iroquoian language, closely related to those of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Nations (Five Nations). Unfortunately peace with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was as difficult to achieve as peace was with the Lënape. Depiction of a Susquehannock man on the Smith Map (1624). The handwritten caption reads (in modern English): \\"The Susquehannocks are a giant-like people and thus attired.\\" When Europeans penetrated the interior of the East Coast of \\"North America\\" from the coastal areas dominated by Algonquian language-speaking Nations, the Europeans usually learned the names of Nations by what the First Nations who were coastal whom the Europeans had encountered, had called them. This is particularly true for the Susquehannock, who lived near Algonquian language-speaking peoples who were generally hostile to the Susquehannock. After a brief period of contact with Europeans, the Susquehannock faced overwhelming depopulation due to epidemic disease--a reality which affected the indigenous peoples of what are now known as \\"the Americas\\".  Names  The Europeans adapted or transliterated these names according to their own languages and spelling systems, trying to capture the sounds of the names. *Huron, another Iroquoian- speaking people, called these people Andastoerrhonon, meaning \\"people of the blackened ridge pole\\", related to their building practices.Wallace: Indians in Pennsylvania); * The French adapted the Huron term and called them the Andaste (Andastes in plural); * The Lenape/Delaware, an Algonquian people, used an ethnonym for their traditional enemy, Mengwe, which meant \\"without penis\\"Brinton, 81 or Miqui, which means \\"foreign, different, far off.\\"Brinton, 85 the Dutch and Swedes derived their term of Minquas for the people from this term.

History  Map of New Netherland & New Sweden, whose Europeans were most in contact with the Susquehannock Peoples before their fall from power ca. 1670–1672. The British experiences in Baltimore were mostly negative, as the colony of Maryland began a war with the Susquehannock Peoples. According to recorded histories, the Susquehannock told Europeans that they originally came from a large river valley to the west. Europeans who wrote this down seemed to assume that the Mississippi River was meant, although no Iroquoian people have ever been found in the archaeological records of the region. Iroquoian peoples were, however, believed to have held a much larger region of Ohio at some point between the 13th and 16th centuries, when European colonization began. They also, however, claimed to have joined with other peoples once east of the Appalachian Mountains to form their nation. Studying the linguistics of recorded examples of the Susquehannock language, it appears to have been closely related to that of the Onondaga. It is most likely that both are correct.http://www.hsobc.org/on-the- susquehannocks-natives-having-previously-used-what-is-now-baltimore-county-as- hunting-grounds/ Similar to how the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Iroquois Confederacy) was organized, there were said to be several distinct tribes of the Susquehannock. Capital towns were named by John Smith as Attock, Quadroque, Tesinigh & Utehowig.http://www.pa- roots.com/clearfield/earlyindianhistory/earlyindianhistory.html The original population numbers for the Susquehannock is uncertain due to lack of contact with the Europeans, whose records provide such data. The Europeans' best guesses were that the tribe numbered from 5000–7000 in 1600, and that the Susquehannock was a regional power capable of holding off the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in the first seven decades of the 17th century, including after the Haudenosaunee Confederacy began systematic warfare against neighboring ethnic groups in pursuit of acquiring firearms during fur trading. Before that time, it was the inland Susquehannock who had allied themselves to Dutch and Swedish traders (1600 & 1610) and Swedish settlers in New Sweden around-1640 who had a monopoly on European flintlock firearms, increasing the tribe's power. These firearms were carefully not traded to Haudenosaunee Confederacy or Lënape until the defeat of the DutchEnglish conquest of New Netherlands in 1667 imposed British control over the entire Atlantic Seaboard from Georgia to New France. see: Second Anglo-Dutch War imposed British traders, who initially favored the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, into the North American Native Nation rivalries and also kept firearms away from the more coastally located Lënape Nation. Prior to 1640, the Susquehannock peoples may have decimated bands of the Lënape Nation in the greater central Delaware Valley region, including raids in force across the Delaware River into what is now central New Jersey. Due to these Susquehannock raids, the Lënape Nation had become a tributary nation of the Susquehannock Nation following a war with the fierce Susquehannock before 1640. The Susquehannock (whose population had been greatly killed off by the time the British tried to assert any significant control over the Susquehannock Homeland) had early on allied with the Swedes, who traded Dutch firearms for Susquehannock furs as early as the 1610s. At this point in time, the Susquehannock were generally opposed to the policies of the new European managers of the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Consequently, the Susquehannock defended themselves from attack in a war declared by the colony/Province of Maryland from 1642-50s and won it, with help from their long-time allies the Swedes. During the mid-17th Century, the Susquehannock found that the English fur traders would trade European firearms, that the Susquehannock greatly desired, for Susquehannock possessed beaver skins. Due to the trade deals that the Susquehannock were getting from the English fur traders, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy began warring against other Nations in the region in order to monopolize the richest fur bearing streams. When the Haudenosaunee Confederacy attempted to impose their will upon the Susquehannock circa 1666, the Susquehannock achieved a great victory against the combined forces of the Seneca nation and Cayuga nation of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Five Nations of the Iroquois), severely damaging the southern populations of both these western Haudenosaunee Confederacy Nations. Susquehannock authority reached a zenith in the early 1670s, after which the Susquehannock suffered an extremely rapid population and authority decline in the mid 1670s, - presumably from infectious diseases such as smallpox, which also decimated other Native American groups such as the Mohawk and other Iroquois language speaking Nations. By 1678, drastically weakened by their losses, the Susquehannock were overwhelmed by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, though some small groups are believed to have fled west via the gaps of the Allegheny into land which was beyond European Colonial influence including into the Ohio Country, possibly becoming absorbed by the Shawnee. Their numbers in their Susquehanna Valley homeland may have diminished to as few as about 300 counted persons in 1700 with another remnant group well to the west in the Allegheny settlement the English called the Conestoga people near Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Before the American Revolution, in mis-targeted response to rumors that they were supporting Pontiac's War, the Susquehannock living in Conestoga Town were massacred by the Paxton Boys. The last two known Susquehannock, a couple named Michael and Mary, were sheltered from the massacre on a farm near Manheim, Pennsylvania and were buried on the property when they died. Susquehannock artifacts on display in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. Society The Susquehannock society was a confederacy of up to 20 smaller tribes, who occupied scattered villages along the Susquehanna River. Most Native American Nations of the time and of today had and have clans. The Susquehannock, being Iroquoian most likely had clans as well. Following the general value of matri-local clan lineage of most Iroquoian peoples, the Susquehannock were likely originally a matri-lineal culture. This would mean in traditional terms, that the line of descent would be traced through the mother or closest female relative. The Susquehannock Nation remained independent and not part of any other confederacy into the 1670s. Ultimately, they were not strong enough to withstand the competition from colonists and other Nations in their piece of the so-called Beaver Wars of that century.Dean R. Snow, The Archaeology of North America, Pearson, 2009 About 1677 many Susquehannock people, decimated by disease and war, merged with their former enemies and Iroquoian language kin, the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Five Nations, who were to the North of the Susquehannock Homeland in what is now called in New York. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy became the successor government to that of the Susquehannock due to the Covenant Chain. This meant that the Haudenosaunee Confederacy now took over the governance of the Susquehannock Homeland. Susquehannock people lived in longhouses like the Haudenosaunee did. The Susquehannock villages were palisaded so that enemies could not easily attack the longhouses in the village. Corn was such an important crop that John Campanius Holm actually recorded the Susquehannock word for it. The Susquehannock kept dogs as indicated by the vocabulary that John Companius Holm wrote. Other important animals for the Susquehannock were turkey, deer, bear, beaver, otter, foxes, and elk. As is seen in the depiction of the Susquehannock man above, men went to war with bows and arrows, and war clubs. The vocabulary is written by John Companius Holmes also includes words specifically meaning \\"smoking tobacco\\", as well as the word for \\"pipe for smoking tobacco\\" which indicates that tobacco smoking was an important part of Susquehannock life. The cut of the hair of the Susquehannock man pictured shows a hairstyle similar but different from that of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Nations. Travel was both on water and on land. On the water, it was via canoe, and several place names indicate locations where the portage was needed between river or stream sections. The main thoroughfare would have been what is today called the Susquehanna River. The length and navigability of this river via canoe would have allowed the Susquehannock to be a powerful regional force and to have strong internal trade routes between sub-tribes and clans. The Susquehanna River is navigable by canoe from near its source in what is now New York to its mouth in the Chesapeake Bay. The location of the Susquehannock Homeland indicates that the Susquehannock language likely contained words for mountains, river features, land animals, plants, fish, coastal species, as well as for the land that was flat. The Pennsylvania Bison was likely hunted by the Susquehannock since the Pennsylvania Bison was found in the Susquehannock Homeland. Breaks in the mountain range would have allowed for over-land travel via well-worn trails. Most travel would likely have been inside of the valleys between the ridges. This would have meant that the Susquehannock had access to trade from what is now the Southeast of the United States via the valley systems. This would mean that the Susquehannock could have traded with the Cherokee directly since the Cherokee were directly South of the Susquehannock Homeland. The Cherokee are another Iroquoian people and it is possible that the languages were not hard for one or the other Nation to learn. Conestoga(Susquehannock) Society would have been impacted and defined by its location. When viewed in a pre-Colonial context, the homelands of the Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy are directly to the North of the Conestoga Homeland. Directly down the Appalachian mountain and valley ranges were the Cherokee. The Conestoga was a Central Iroquoian people and as such occupied a region of the Appalachian Mountains that was critical to trade and travel along the south-north axis that most of the valleys occupy. This would have enabled the Conestoga to be prosperous in trade with the Cherokee, defended from the North against the Haudenosaunee Confederacy due to the vast Appalachian mountain and valley region, and shielded up to a point from the Lënape to the East. To the West, the Appalachian Mountains would have shielded the Conestoga from the Algonquian Shawano (Shawnee) and thus prevent the threat of invasion from that direction. Thus the Conestoga enjoyed life in a natural fortress due to protection on 3 sides from the Appalachian Mountains and valleys. Conestoga villages were likely traditionally built on top of ridges of the Appalachian Mountains when such ridges were available. The Conestoga site in what is now Sayre, Pennsylvania is evidence for this. At this site was likely a religious complex, known currently as Spanish Hill. Spanish Hill is possibly an artificial hill, and possibly natural. Research is still being conducted regarding this issue. Building on the ridges would have allowed the Conestoga to view from the safety of their villages the surrounding area, which was likely used for farming of corn, beans, and squash. This pattern of using the land near the rivers and streams for farming has been found in many Native American societies in the East of Turtle Island (North America). Building villages on ridge tops would have allowed the Conestoga to observe advancing enemy movements and to be safe in times of flood. The Conestoga lived in settled villages and were not known to be nomadic. The Conestoga Homeland is the most flood-prone area of the East of Turtle Island, owing to the number of rivers and their tributaries. The Conestoga likely practiced sylvan agriculture like the other Native Nations of the East of Turtle Island. Nuts and berries would have been harvested from the forest and mushrooms would probably have been harvested as well. Harvest time for many berries and nuts can be ascertained from the current wild availability of the berries and nuts in the Conestoga Homeland. Harvest time for corn, beans, and squash was likely late Summer till early Fall. Following the normal seasonal festival/religious patterns of other Iroquois people, the Conestoga most likely followed a seasonal calendar of planting, harvest, and Winter festivals. Dreams were likely important to Conestoga people. All other Iroquoian peoples put great stock in dreams and the Conestoga was likely to have thought dreams to be important too. Archeological materials have been found in Pennsylvania and Maryland's Allegany County at the Barton (18AG3) and Llewellyn (18AG26) sites. West Virginia's Grant, Hampshire and Hardy counties region (Brashler 1987) also have archaeological sites where Susquehannock ceramics have been found. Archeologists have also found evidence of these people along the Potomac River and its tributaries. They have classified these artifacts as the \\"late Susquehannock sequence\\".

The English seldom visited the upper Susquehanna inland region during the early colonial period. It is likely that the Conestoga had occupied the same lands for several thousand years. When Captain John Smith of Jamestown met them in 1608, they had a formidable village in the lower river valley (present-day Lancaster, Pennsylvania developed near here.) Captain Smith wrote of the Susquehannock, \\"They can make neere 600 able and mighty men, and are pallisadoed [palisaded] in their Townes to defend them from the Massawomekes, their mortal enemies.\\" He was astonished to find the Conestoga were brokering trade with French goods. He estimated the population of their village to be 2,000, although he never visited it. The French explorer Samuel Champlain noted the Conestoga in his Voyages of Samuel Champlain; in 1615, he called one of their 20 villages, Carantouan. It was located on the upper Susquehanna River near present-day New York state. It rallied more than 800 warriors with two other villages, Champlain reported. Modern estimates of the total Conestoga population, including the whole territory in 1600, range as high as 7,000 people. During the sixteenth century and carrying forward into the first decades of colonization, the Conestoga were the most numerous people in what is now called the Susquehanna Valley. During the early Dutch colonization of New Netherland, the Conestoga traded furs with the Europeans. As early as 1623, they struggled to go north past the Lenape (later known as the Delaware), who occupied territory along the Delaware River, to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. In 1634, the Conestoga defeated the Lënape in that area, who may have become their tributaries. New Sweden - encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware In 1638, Swedish settlers established New Sweden in the Delaware Valley near the coast. Their location near the bay enabled them to interrupt the Conestoga fur trade with the Dutch further north along the coast. In 1642, the English Province of Maryland declared war on the Conestoga. With the help of the Swedes, the Conestoga defeated the English in 1644. The Conestoga were in an intermittent state of war with Maryland until 1652. As a result, they traded almost exclusively with New Sweden to the north. In 1652 the Conestoga concluded a peace treaty with Maryland. In return for arms and safety on their southern flank, they ceded to Maryland large territories on both shores of the Chesapeake Bay. This decision was also related to the Beaver Wars of the late 1650s, in which the Haudenosaunee swept south and west against other tribes and territories to expand their hunting grounds for the fur trade. With the help of Maryland's arms, the Conestoga fought off the Iroquois Confederacy for a time, and a brief peace followed. In 1658, the Conestoga used their influence with the Esopus to end the Esopus Wars, because that conflict interfered with their important trade with the Dutch. From 1658 to 1662, the Conestoga were at war with the powerful Haudenosaunee Confederacy (based south of the Great Lakes) which was seeking new hunting grounds for the fur trade. By 1661, Maryland colonists and the Conestoga had expanded their peace treaty into a full alliance against the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Fifty Englishmen were assigned to the Conestoga to guard their fort. In 1663, the Conestoga defeated a large Haudenosaunee Confederacy invasion force. In April 1663, the Conestoga village on the upper Ohio River was attacked by Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga warriors of the western Iroquois. (JR: 48:7-79, NYCD 12:431). In 1669–70, John Lederer was guided by a Conestoga man on his journey to the southwest Virginia and North Carolina (Mooney 1894:32). Paul A. W. Wallace writes, \\"In 1669 Iroquois Indians warned the French that if they tried to descend the Ohio River they would be in danger from the \\"Updates.\\" (Susquesahanocks: Wallace 1961:13). In 1672, the Conestoga defeated another Haudenosaunee Confederacy war party. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy appealed to the French colonial government for support because the Haudenosaunee Confederacy could not \\"defend themselves if the others came to attack them in their villages\\". Some old histories indicate that the Haudenosaunee Confederacy ultimately defeated the Conestoga, but no record of a defeat has been found.Jennings, p. 135 In 1675 the Conestoga suffered a major defeat by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. English colonists invited the tribe to resettle in the colony of Maryland, where they relocated. It needs to be noted that this was not a territory unfamiliar to Conestoga people because this part of the colony of Maryland was actually the Southern area of the Conestoga Homeland. The Conestoga suffered from getting caught up in Bacon's Rebellion the following year.Waldman, Native American Tribes, p. 286 After some Doeg Indians killed some Virginians, surviving colonists crossed into the colony of Maryland and killed Conestoga in retaliation. The Conestoga moved to old Fort Piscataway, below present-day Washington, DC. Problems on the frontiers led to the mobilization of the militias of the colony of Maryland and the colony of Virginia. In confusion, the colonial militias of Maryland and Virginia surrounded the peaceful Conestoga village. When five Conestoga Chiefs came out of their village to negotiate with the colonial militias of Maryland and Virginia, the colonial militias murdered the five Conestoga Chiefs. The Conestoga left their own village at night and harassed colonists in the colonies of Virginia and Maryland. The Conestoga from this village eventually returned to the area of the Susquehanna River. =Covenant Chain Treaty= In 1676 the Haudenosaunee Confederacy made a peace with the colony of Maryland and the colony of Virginia, and the Lënape/Delaware. In a treaty with the Conestoga, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy offered to shelter the Conestoga, distant relations through the Iroquoian-language family, and sometimes allies. Around 1677, most of the remaining Conestoga moved to New York, joining mostly with the Seneca and Onondaga Nations, who also spoke Iroquoian languages. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, which had a long tradition of adopting defeated enemies into their tribes, and Governor Edmund Andros of the colony/Province of New York told the Conestoga that the Conestoga would be welcome in the lands of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and protected from the colonies of Maryland and Virginia. Some Conestoga returned to their homeland on the southern shores of the Susquehanna River, keeping their distance from the center of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Others moved to the upper Delaware River into the somewhat depopulated Delaware Nation lands (ravaged both by the Conestoga who had made them tributary Nations, and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, which had competed with the Algonquian-speaking peoples and had attempted to bring the Algonquian-speaking Nations under The Covenant Chain), where they lived under the protection of the colony of New York. After adopting the majority of the Conestoga, the Iroquois acquired most of the territory along the Susquehanna River, but they never claimed below the Fall Line. Some of the Conestoga people merged with the Meherrin, and allied Nottoway or Mangoac, the Iroquoian-speaking tribes located in what was then the colonies of Virginia and North Carolina. The new group called themselves Chiroenhaka, according to the 20th-century ethnologist James Mooney. As of 2009, researchers found archaeological evidence of Conestoga movement into and habitation of areas such as the Mouth of the Seneca(46Pd1) and Pancake Island(46Hm73) villages in present-day West Virginia, according to Bryan Ward, West Virginia Division of Culture and History. The Conestoga population had been devastated by high fatalities from new Eurasian infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, followed by warfare. About 1697, a few hundred Conestoga people settled in a new village in what is now known as Lancaster County, Pennsylvania called Conestoga Town. The river was at that point named the Conestoga River under the colonial governor of the colony of Pennsylvania, Governor William Penn. A type of wagon was named for them that was later used by pioneers migrating west. Hardware kits for the wagons were made on the east side of the Allegheny Mountains. In the early 1700s, some Conestoga migrated to Ohio, where they merged with other tribes, becoming known as the Mingo. The Conestoga people at Conestoga Town lived under the protection of the provincial Pennsylvania government, but their population declined steadily. In 1763, a census counted twenty-two people in Conestoga Town. That year the Paxton Boys, in response to Pontiac's Rebellion on the western side of the Allegheny Mountains, attacked Conestoga Town (which was located on the eastern side of the Allegheny Mountains and had nothing to do with Pontiac's war of resistance to European colonial encroachment), killing six people. The remaining Conestoga inhabitants of Conestoga Town were sheltered in a Lancaster workhouse by the colonial government of the colony of Pennsylvania. The governor of the colony of Pennsylvania discouraged further violence, but two weeks later, the Paxton Boys killed the 14 Conestoga people who were staying at the workhouse. The Conestoga negotiated a treaty with the whites allowing settlement in the Conestoga Homeland. The Conestoga Chiefs making the negotiation never made a treaty giving up the lands to the whites for white ownership or administration. Due to the ever-changing relationship of Aboriginal Americans (American Indians/Native Americans) to colonists and colonial governments, then finally after 1776 with the government of the new United States, the Conestoga homeland was never officially ceded to the United States of America. The Covenant Chain prevented the Conestoga from making any such treaty of cession of any of the Conestoga Homeland to the United States and remains respected by Conestoga people to this day.

Biography Boyang was born as Guō Dìngshēng () in Kaifeng, Henan Province, China, with family origins in Huixian.. United Daily. April 29, 2008. Boyang's father changed his son's name to Guō Lìbāng () to facilitate a transfer to another school. Bo Yang later changed his name to Guo Yìdòng, also spelled Kuo I-tung (). In high school, Boyang participated in youth organisations of the Kuomintang, the then-ruling party of the Republic of China, and joined the Kuomintang itself in 1938. He graduated from the National Northeastern University, and moved to Taiwan after the Kuomintang lost the civil war in 1949. . China Times. 29 April 2008. Accessed 30 April 2008. In 1950, he was imprisoned for six months for listening to Communist Chinese radio broadcasts. He had various jobs during his life, including that of a teacher. During this time, he began to write novels. In 1960, he began using the pen name Boyang when he started to write a political commentary column in the Independent Evening News. The name was derived from a place name in the mountains of Taiwan; he adopted it because he liked the sound of it. In 1961, he achieved acclaim with his novel The Alien Realm ( Yìyù), which told the story of a Kuomintang force which fought on in the borderlands of southwestern China long after the government had retreated to Taiwan. He became director of the Pingyuan Publishing House in 1966, and also edited the cartoon page of China Daily ().Wang Xiaolu, “Bo Yang”, ibidem, p.62. Boyang was arrested again in 1967 because of his sarcastic \\"unwitting\\" criticism of Taiwan's leader Chiang Kai-shek and in particular a translation of a comic strip of Popeye.June Teufel Dreyer. \\"Taiwan's Evolving Identity.\\" 17 July 2003.

Chiang was displeased because he saw this as a parody of his arrival (with a defeated army) in Taiwan, his brutal usurpation of the Presidency (a KMT competitor favored as head of government by the Truman administration was executed) and his strategy of slowly installing his son Chiang Ching-kuo as heir apparent.

Having detained Bo Yang, the KMT's “military interrogators told him that he could be beaten to death at any time the authorities desired” when the writer refused to swallow their trumped-up charges.Philip F. Williams and Yenna Wu, The Great Wall of Confinement. The Chinese Prison Camp through Contemporary Fiction and Reportage. Berkeley CA (University of California Press) 2004, p.135. – . “Several interrogators” including Liu Chan-hua and Kao Yi-rue “played cat and mouse with him, alternating promise of immediate release with threats” and torture.(Dongwu zhengzhi shehui xue bao Soochow Journal of Political Science (published by Soochow University, Taipei), issue 23/2006, p.16. In order to make him confess, they broke his leg.”Taiwanese interrogators broke his leg to elicit a confession...”, the US journalist Kristof mentions; any sharp drop in the temperature still caused the writer pain many years later and made walking difficult for him. See Nicholas D. Kristof, “One Author is Rankling Two Chinas,” in: The New York Times, October 07, 1987 Western allies of the regime were not unaware of this.Chiang Wei-kuo , a son of the dictator in charge of the Military Garrison Command, had been attending an equivalent of West Point in Germany during the Third Reich period and the BND, a West German secret service, commanded by a high-ranking former Nazi secret service man, Mr. Gehlen, always had close relations with its counterpart in Taiwan, according to a press notice by the West German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau. The same was obviously true of the American counterpart. In the late 1940s, the US vice consul in Taipei, George H. Kerr, who later expressed regrets, was also fully aware of the massacres carried out by the KMT regime, estimating that about 10,000 of the demonstrators protesting against corruption, harassment and unrestrained violence of the police on Feb. 28, 1947 were killed on that day and in the next few days, and another 10,000 in the immediate aftermath of the crack-down. See: George Kerr, Formosa Betrayed. Boston (Houghton Mifflin) 1965. Shelley Rigger says that “Peng Ming-min, Bo Yang and Lei Chen” were “high -profile White Terror cases” in the 1960s but in fact, many “ of Taiwanese and Mainlanders were swept up by the White Terror, suffering imprisonment, torture, (…) execution.”Prof. Peng Ming-min, whose father had been executed by the regime in the context of the February 28 Incident, became a victim in 1964 because he and his colleagues at Taida wrote a manifesto calling for reforms. Shelley Rigger, Why Taiwan Matters: Small Island, Global Powerhouse. Lanham MD (Rowman & Littlefield) 2011, 2014, p.65. – . The prosecutor initially sought the death sentence but due to US pressure this was reduced to twelve years in the Green Island concentration camp. From 1969 Bo Yang was incarcerated as a political prisoner (for \\"being a Communist agent and attacking national leaders\\") on Green Island for nine years. The original 12-year sentence was commuted to eight years after the death of Chiang Kai- shek in 1975. However, the government refused to release Bo Yang after his sentence expired, and released him only in 1977, giving in to pressure from international organizations such as Amnesty International. After his release, Bo Yang continued to campaign for human rights and democracy in Taiwan. Towards the end of his life Bo Yang stated in his memoirs that he did not have the slightest intention to insult Chiang Kai-shek with his Popeye translation. This was due to the fact that in his view objective criticism mattered whereas personal insults were irrelevant.Zhou Bise , with Bo Yang , Bo Yang hui yi lu (Bo Yang, Memoirs; Zhou's account, based on oral statements by Bo Yang). Taipei (Yuanliu chuban ) minguo 85 [=1996]. =Works= Lin Zi-yao notes that during his life “Bo Yang covered a wide range of subjects from culture, literature, politics and education to love, marriage, family planning, fashion and women.”Lin Zi-yao, “Preface,” in: Lin Zi-yao (ed.), One Author Is Rankling Two Chinas. Taipei (Sinkuang Book Co.) 1989, p.16. Much of this is not fiction, although he also published a significant body of short stories, novels, and poetry..Howard Goldblatt says that “it is significant” that an anthology of his short stories entitled Secrets in English was “published in Chinese under the author's true name Kuo I-tung, for 'Bo Yang' is not essentially a writer of fiction.” Goldblatt adds, “Yet like 'Bo Yang' [the writer of essays], Kuo I-tung [the novelist and short story writer] is a social critic; his fiction is written with an eye to the recording of events and to the social inequities that gave rise to them.” See Howard Goldblatt, “Foreword,” in: Bo Yang, Poems of A Period, Hong Kong (Joint Publishing Co.) 1986, p.XI) Aside from his Golden Triangle novel Yiyu, (, 1961), Boyang is best known for his non-fiction works on Chinese history (collated and translated into modern colloquial Chinese from historical records in the prison library on Green Island) and The Ugly Chinaman ( Chǒulòu de Zhōngguórén, 1985; English translation, with the subtitle ... and the Crisis of Chinese Culture, 1992). In the introduction to excerpts from The Ugly Chinaman, the editors of an anthology entitled Sources of Chinese Tradition from 1600 through the Twentieth Century state that “(t)he sharply negative tone of the (…) essay reflects a sense of (…) despair (…) as well as a feeling that age-old weaknesses have persisted through revolutionary change.”Sources of Chinese Tradition from 1600 through the Twentieth Century, Vol. 2, compiled by Wm. Theodore Barry and Richard Lufrano, with the collaboration of Wing-tsit Chan et al. New York NY (Columbia University Press) 2nd edition 2000, p. 565. – . Also referring to The Ugly Chinaman, Rana Mitter says that Bo Yang's position as a critical observer and analyst of the world is similar to Lu Xun's.Both were skeptical, yet committed writers and less naive than younger 'romanticists'. “Lu Xun regarded his mission as being to try and wake up a few of the sleepers in an 'iron house' in which they were burning to death, and from which there was still no guarantee to escape. The message mixed bleakness with hope, with perhaps more emphasis on bleakness. In contrast, the impatience of the romanticists was for a better world which they felt they could almost touch; they just had to motivate the nation and the people to reach it. A similar division can be seen in the treatment of modern China in (…) more contemporary works. Bo Yang's account of the Chinese people is dark and suggests that a long, painful process will be necessary before China will be saved. (…) Bo Yang (like Lu Xun) made his criticism while declining to join a political party. Again, like Lu Xun, Bo Yang was of an older generation when his essay [The Ugly Chinaman] was finally published (65 years old) (...)” See: Rana Mitter, A Bitter Revolution: China's Struggle with the Modern World, Oxford UK; New York NY (Oxford University Press) 2004, 2005. p.270. – ; 978-0-19-280605-5. Edward M. Gunn agrees, saying that “(t)he fact that Bo Yang is a prolific author of satirical essays (zawen) inevitably recalls the work of Lu Xun.”Edward M. Gunn, Rewriting Chinese: Style and Innovation in Twentieth-Century Chinese Prose. Stanford CA (Stanford University Press) 1991, p.156) Gunn also emphasizes Bo Yang's “particular interest in history” and the “acerbic wit in defense of democracy and social welfare” (or social rights of the common people).“Bo Yang had indeed enjoyed playful irony in his use of wenyan wen and wordplay, as well as sport with complex syntax, all of which are key features of Lu Xun's writing.” Edward M. Gunn, ibidem, p.156. – Considering the fact that Lu Xun's writing were described as subversive and remained inaccessible to almost every citizen in Taiwan due to the ban on printing or possessing them, it is obvious that Bo Yang's Lu Xun'esque wit had to cause trouble for him under dictators like Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo. Bo Yang gained attention internationally when a volume of poetry entitled Poems of a Period was published in Hong Kong in 1986. These poems recall his arrest and imprisonment. =Later years= Bo Yang lived in Taipei in his later years. He became the founding president of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International. In 1994, Boyang underwent heart surgery, and his health never fully recovered. He carried the honorary title of national policy advisor to the administration of President Chen Shui-bian. In 2006, Boyang retired from writing, and donated the bulk of his manuscripts to the Chinese Modern Literature Museum in Beijing. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the National Tainan University, to which he also donated many memorabilia and some manuscripts. Boyang died of pneumonia in a hospital near his Xindian residence on 29 April 2008. He was married five times, and is survived by his last wife, Chang Hsiang-hua, and five children born by his former wives. On 17 May 2008, his ashes were scattered along the seashore of Green Island, where he was once imprisoned.

Following the July 7 incident in 1937, the hotel was taken over by Japanese forces and later by the Kuomintang government.Official website History Later, the banquet hall served guests such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai at the inauguration of the People's Republic. A new wing was added on the west side of the 1917 wing of the Beijing Hotel in 1954, it is today known as Block C. The original red brick 1915 wing was demolished for the construction of Block D, on the east, in 1974. At 89 meters, the tower was the tallest building in Beijing at the time. Finally, Block E was built directly behind the 1917 wing in 2001. The hotel complex today operates under three separate names. In April 2005, Raffles Hotels and Resorts Limited signed an agreement with the Beijing Tourism Group (BTG), to re-brand and manage the historic 1917 Block B in the middle and the modern Block E behind it under the Raffles brand. After carrying out renovations and refurbishment, that portion of the complex was re-launched as Raffles Beijing Hotel (S: 北京饭店莱佛士, T: 北京飯店萊佛士, P: Běijīng Fàndiàn Láifóshì) in 2006. The contract ended in 2016 and those blocks were renamed Beijing Hotel NUO on December 1, 2016. Block C, on the left, is today the Grand Hotel Beijing. The towering Block D, on the right, is today the only remaining wing to use the name Beijing Hotel. The hotel usually caters to foreigners and wealthy domestic guests, providing restaurants and bars in a Western and Asian style.Watson, J. L. & Caldwell M. L. The Cultural Politics of Food and Eating. Blackwell Publishing, 2005. . Various members of state have stayed there, including Richard Nixon, U Nu, Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Sun Yat-sen. The hotel has been awarded the Five Star Diamond Award for consecutive years. During the 2008 Summer Olympics, the hotel served as the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee. Significance Many foreign journalists were based in the hotel during the spring of 1989. This was the site where Associated Press photographer Jeff Widener took the famous \\"Unknown Rebel\\" picture during the Tiananmen Square protests. According to journalist Zhang Boli, the last meetings between the students and government took place at the hotel on May 30, 1989, where no agreement was reached.Zhao, D.

He directed 30 full-length feature films, including the highly successful That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio), The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) and On Guard (Le Bossu). His works include historical, romantic epics such as Chouans! and King of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur), as well as comedies with a charismatic, breezy hero ready to embark upon any adventure which comes his way, so long as it means escaping everyday modern life: Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur), The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue), The African (L'Africain). He had links with the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, with whom he made six films, as well as with Jean-Pierre Cassel, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort.  Biography  Philippe de Broca was born on 15 March 1933 in Paris, France. He was the son of a cinema set designer and the grandson of a well-known painter, Philippe de Broca. He studied at the Paris Photography and Cinematography School (école Vaugirard), graduating in 1953. He carried out his military service with the service cinématographique des armées (army film service) in Germany and then in Algeria, directing or acting as head cameraman on short films. Greatly affected by the war he witnessed, he vowed to show life in its best light in his future films “because laughter is the best defence against upsets in life”. Back on civvy street, he set off on a journey taking in the length of Africa in Berliet trucks before returning to Paris. He began working as an intern with Henri Decoin, before finding assistant positions with Claude Chabrol: Bitter Reunion (Le Beau Serge), The Cousins (Les Cousins), Web of Passion (À Double Tour), François Truffaut: The 400 Blows (Les 400 Coups) and Pierre Schoendoerffer: Ramuntcho. In 1959, Claude Chabrol produced de Broca's first film for him, The Love Game (Les jeux de l’amour) with Jean-Pierre Cassel. De Broca went on to work with Cassel again in The Joker (Le Farceur, 1960), Five Day Lover (L’Amant de cinq jours, 1961), and Male Companion (Un Monsieur de Compagnie, 1964). De Broca's first commercial success came with Swords of Blood (Cartouche), filmed in 1962. This film also saw two more names become associated with de Broca: the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine. International acclaim came with That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio) in 1964, Up to His Ears (Les tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine) in 1965, The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) in 1973 and Incorrigible (L'Incorrigible) in 1975. In 1966, he co-wrote, directed and produced King of Hearts (Le Roi de Cœur). This parody of the Great War, which some cinema- lovers consider his masterpiece, was a commercial and personal failure, to de Broca's dismay. Next his career took a turn towards seemingly straightforward comedy and fun: The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue) featuring Yves Montand in 1969, then Dear Detective (Tendre Poulet) in 1978 and Jupiter's Thigh (On a volé la cuisse de Jupiter) in 1980 with Philippe Noiret and Annie Girardot, and finally Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur) in 1979 with Jean Rochefort. In 1988, his film Chouans! with Sophie Marceau and Philippe Noiret, which questioned historical philosophies, was not as successful as expected. He then directed ten or so telefilms, enjoying the speed of filming as well as the teamwork involved. De Broca found success again in 1997 with his adaptation of On Guard (Le Bossu) for Daniel Auteuil. In 2004 Philippe de Broca filmed the adaptation of the novel Viper in the Fist (Vipère au poing) with Jacques Villeret and Catherine Frot. This movie was to be his last hit with the cinema-going public, although he was not able to enjoy the success, passing away from cancer on 26 November 2004. Throughout his career, de Broca's work alternates between two styles: large-scale productions like Swords of Blood (Cartouche), King of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur) or On Guard (Le Bossu), and lively, punchy contemporary adventure-comedies like That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio), The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) or Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur). Yet even this dual classification is not easily applied to Philippe de Broca's work, because the man himself hated conventions and enjoyed blurring the line between the real world and the imaginary. His films, which may at first glance seem lightweight, are being re-assessed by cinema- lovers as a thoughtful life's work, which asks questions about society in the second half of the 20th century. De Broca remained loyal to his actors throughout his films, as well as to the writers Daniel Boulanger and Michel Audiard, and enjoyed an exceptional musical affinity with Georges Delerue. Today, Philippe de Broca is acknowledged by the younger generation of movie directors, such as Ryan Coogler, Antonio Negret or Emmanuel Issanchou, who frequently cite his work.  Personal life  Philippe de Broca was married to Michelle de Broca, with whom he founded the production company Fildebroc. He has two daughters, Chloé and Jade, with Michelle; and one son Alexandre, with Marthe Keller. For over 30 years he lived in the village of Vert in the Yvelines department to the west of Paris, where he greatly enjoyed tending his garden. He felt a strong connection with Brittany since his childhood, his painter grandfather having lived there, as well as being fond of his boat. He chose to be buried in Sauzon cemetery on Belle-Ile.

He was the son of Sir William Tresham and his wife Isabel de Vaux, daughter of Sir William Vaux of Harrowden. Thomas's early advancement was due to his father's influence. In 1443 he and his father were appointed as stewards to the Duchy of Lancaster's estates in Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and by 1446 Thomas was serving as an esquire for Henry VI, being made an usher of the king's chamber in 1455. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Huntingdonshire in 1446, a position he held until 1459, and was returned to Parliament for Buckinghamshire in 1447 and Huntingdonshire in 1449. Despite the Tresham family's close links with the royal court they were also on good terms with Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and when he returned from Ireland in 1450 Tresham and his father went to greet him. Shortly after leaving home on 23 September they were attacked by a group of men involved in a property dispute with his father; William Tresham was killed, and Thomas was injured. After recovering from his injuries he again began to take government appointments; he was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire between 1451 and 1452, a justice of the peace between 1452 and 1460 for Northamptonshire and a Member of Parliament in 1453 for Northamptonshire. Tresham stayed in favour throughout the disturbances of 1456, and was again made High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire between 1457 and 1458, and for Sussex and Surrey between 1458 and 1459. He was returned to parliament in 1459 for Northamptonshire again, and the parliament, packed with anti- Yorkists, chose him to act as Speaker of the House of Commons. After the Parliament ended he was appointed to various anti-Yorkist commissions of Oyer and terminer, followed by an appointment as Comptroller of the Household in 1460. He fought at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, but denied having been at the Battle of Wakefield, an odd thing for a Lancastrian. He joined up with Margaret of Anjou in January 1461 and fought at the Second Battle of St Albans, where he was knighted. He fought at the Battle of Towton and was captured; despite being one of the lords on whom Edward IV had placed a £100 bounty, he only suffered forfeiture. He secured a pardon in 1464 and again represented Northamptonshire in Parliament in 1467, but failed to regain his lands and possessions. As a result, he took part in the plots of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1468 until Henry VI regained the throne in 1470. He was rewarded for his services and loyalty with various grants, including that of Huntingdon Castle, to be held for seven years. After the Battle of Barnet he fled to meet Margaret of Anjou but was captured and executed on 6 May 1471. His children by Mary, daughter of William, Lord Zouche of Harringworth, included a son, John, who was born in 1462. John was restored to his father's estates after the reversal of the attainder by Henry VII in 1485. John's son was Sir Thomas Tresham (d.1559). A daughter, Isabella, was born in 1460 and married Sir Henry de Vere of Addington, thus establishing a long line of descendants.The National Dictionary of Biography makes no mention of a daughter named Isabella.

It is located 11 kilometres southeast of the Auckland CBD, close to the western banks of the Tamaki River and the northern shore of the Panmure Basin (or Kaiahiku). To the north lies the suburb of Tamaki, and to the west is the cone of Maungarei / Mount Wellington. Demographics Panmure, comprising the statistical areas of Panmure West and Panmure East, had a population of 3,651 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 393 people (12.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 732 people (25.1%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,257 households. There were 1,839 males and 1,815 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.01 males per female, with 594 people (16.3%) aged under 15 years, 891 (24.4%) aged 15 to 29, 1,644 (45.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 525 (14.4%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 41.6% European/Pākehā, 14.1% Māori, 20.7% Pacific peoples, 35.0% Asian, and 3.4% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 45.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 35.5% had no religion, 44.0% were Christian, and 15.0% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 840 (27.5%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 450 (14.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,629 (53.3%) people were employed full- time, 345 (11.3%) were part-time, and 144 (4.7%) were unemployed.  History  The Maori name for the area was Tauoma.The Royal New Zealand Fencibles. R. Alexander. G Gibson. A LaRoche. Deed. Waiuku .1997. pp71-75 One of the traditional portages between the Waitematā Harbour and the Manukau Harbour was near here. 4.6 km up the Tamaki River Maori would beach their waka (canoes) at the end of a small creek (that now passes under the southern motorway) and drag them overland (where Portage Road is now) to the Manukau harbour. During the Musket wars in late September 1821, Mokaia Pa was the scene of severe fighting and was sacked by 4000 musket carrying warriors such as Nga Puhi from the north led by Hongi Hika. The fighting devastated what had been the Ngāti Pāoa population centre of the Auckland Isthmus during pre-European times which had a population of about 7,000. Three thousand men with up to 100 muskets took part in the defence of the Pa but after a close and bitter battle were defeated by the combined northern alliance who had between 500 and 1000 muskets.P24=26 Cannibal Jack. T Bentley Mokaia Pa, on the headland to the east of the Panmure lagoon, was visited in 1820 by the missionary Samuel Marsden. In 1841, the Government bought the Kohimaramara block from Ngati Paoa. In January 1842 Felton Mathew surveyed \\"Tehmaki\\" into 37 farms totalling 3,856 acres. Part of this became the Fencible settlement of Panmure, between Maungarei and the Tamaki River. In 1848, 80 Fencible families came here from Ireland and England on the ship Clifton and established a settlement with 99 raupo huts on the eastern shores of the lagoon. They called the area Maggotty Hollow. Located on the Tamaki River, Panmure was favoured by Felton Mathew to be the new capital of New Zealand. William Hobson, however, decided otherwise, and the new town of Auckland arose further to the west along the shores of the Waitematā Harbour. Panmure was then instead created as a fencible settlement, where retired soldiers were contracted to defend the settlement in return for land. The soldiers had to give 12 days military service per year and parade on Sunday in full military equipment. The only time they were called to arms was in 1851 when a flotilla of 20 waka took about 350 warriors to Mechanics Bay to attack Auckland. The Panmure fencibles were issued ammunition to defend the Tamaki River and stop any armed Maori attack. Only the Onehunga fencibles were marched to the hill over looking Mechanics Bay to join a British line regiment. In the 1863 attack on Auckland the government used mainly professional soldiers instead.The Royal NZ Fencibles. pp75-85 Panmure was an important town and port as it was strategically placed near the narrowest part of the isthmus, and during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s it became a very busy place. Even after the railway reached Auckland in 1908, Panmure somewhat continued as a transport hub – steamers from Auckland en route to the goldfields in the Coromandel and Firth of Thames would call in here. Panmure prospered partly due to being on the route between Auckland and the much larger fencibles settlement of Howick in the 1800s. People and goods used the ferry at the narrow point below Mokoia Pa.Royal NZ Fencibles.pp75-85. Until about the middle of the 20th century, Panmure remained a prosperous but mostly pastoral setting, the smallest borough of Auckland, and described as \\"a quarter of a square mile of farmlets surrounding a sleepy village that boasted little more than a church, post office, a handful of shops, and a two-storey hotel that was widely known from horse and buggy days\\". It was only with the explosive growth of suburbia around it after World War II, and better bridges to Pakuranga that Panmure relatively suddenly started to grow significantly, and become a commercial centre.  Recent developments  Work was completed on the Panmure section (Stage 1) of the Auckland Transport project called AMETI (Auckland-Manukau Eastern Transport Initiative) which aims to improve the connections of eastern Auckland towards the south-east (Manukau central).http://www.aucklandtransport.govt.nz/improving-transport/current- projects/01IntegratedTravel/Pages/AMETI-Panmure.aspx As part of this, Panmure railway station underwent a major upgrade, increasing capacity and frequency of trains into the city (now a 17-minute travel time to Britomart station). The new Te Horeta Rd, the last major milestone, opened on 2 November 2015. Other related upgrades included the building of three new bridges, new cycle paths and foot paths. Stage 2 of AMETI will see the completion of the 7 km Eastern Busway which will link Panmure railway station with Pakuranga and Botany. This is expected to cut public transport journey times significantly and relieve congestion on roads. The busway is expected to attract 5.5 million passengers a year.http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/new-busway-congested-eastern- roads/5/120721 The Panmure Roundabout will become an intersection, a change that will see new investment in the redevelopment of the land adjacent to and north of the rail station. The Tamaki Transformation Programme was announced in early 2012 by Housing Minister Phil Heatley. This will be the country's first urban regeneration programme. Heatley said that east Auckland was chosen because it was an area with \\"significant potential\\". \\"It is close to the Auckland and Manukau central business districts. It has a young population, a sense of history and community, green spaces and near-coastal location\\". Following this announcement, Auckland Council and the New Zealand government formed the Tamaki Redevelopment Company to deliver the Tamaki Transformation Programme with the aim of creating a \\"thriving, attractive, sustainable and self-reliant community through a series of interlinking and economic, social, urban space and housing projects\\".http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local- news/7599791/Boss-ready-to-transform-eastern-suburbs Substantial Central and Local Government partnership investment into the Tamaki Regeneration Programme will see change over the next 25 years, aiming to improve the overall quality of life to the residents of Tamaki with an expected doubling of the population in this area.

He was the head coach at Stanford University (1995–2001), the University of Notre Dame (2002–2004), and the University of Washington (2005–2008), compiling a career college football record of 76–88–1. Early career Willingham attended Jacksonville Senior High School in Jacksonville, North Carolina and lettered in football, basketball, and baseball. He went on to Michigan State University, where he played football and baseball and graduated in 1977 with a degree in physical education. Willingham held assistant coaching positions at his alma mater (1977, 1980–82), Central Michigan University (1978–79), North Carolina State University (1983–85), Rice University (1986–88), and Stanford University (1989–91). When Stanford head coach Dennis Green was hired as the Minnesota Vikings head coach in 1992, Willingham followed him as running backs coach (1992–94). Head coaching positions =Stanford= Following the 1994 season, despite having never been more than a position coach at any level, Willingham returned to Stanford as head coach, succeeding Bill Walsh. In his seven seasons (1995–2001) as coach, he led the Cardinal]to a 44–36–1 record and four bowl game appearances. Notably, Willingham’s teams went undefeated (7-0) against arch-rival California. In 2000, he was presented with the Eddie Robinson Coach of Distinction Award that is given annually to honor \\"an outstanding college football coach and role model for career achievement\\". His best team was the 1999 team, which won the school's first outright Pacific-10 Conference title in 29 years and appeared in the 2000 Rose Bowl. Willingham's 44 wins were the most by a Stanford coach since John Ralston, who left the school for the Denver Broncos of the NFL after the 1971 season. =Notre Dame= 2002 On December 31, 2001, Willingham was hired as head coach at Notre Dame. Willingham began the 2002 season by going 8–0, and went on to become the only first-year coach in Notre Dame history to win 10 games. For his efforts, he was named the ESPN/Home Depot College Coach of the Year, the Scripps College Coach of the Year, the Black Coaches Association Male Coach of the Year, and the George Munger Award College Coach of the Year by the Maxwell Football Club. In the 2002 regular-season finale, ND was blown out by arch- rival USC, 44–13, and was outgained 610–109—the worst such margin in school history. That loss knocked ND from a likely Bowl Championship Series berth down to the 2003 Gator Bowl—where they were beaten by North Carolina State, 28–6. 2003 The 2003 team finished 5–7 and was beaten badly in four of those losses, getting shut out twice in one season for the first time since 1960 and finishing with a point differential of 243–315—the worst of any Fighting Irish team since the 2–8 team of 1956. 2004 In 2004, Notre Dame posted a 6–5 record in the regular season, including a 41–16 loss to Purdue (the second-worst home loss ever to Purdue) and ending with Willingham's third consecutive loss to USC for his fifth loss by 30 points or more, and eighth by 22 points or more, in his three seasons. The following Tuesday, November 30, after an overall record in South Bend of 21–15 (an 8-0 start followed by a 13-15 finish), Notre Dame terminated Willingham as head coach. Defensive coordinator Kent Baer served as acting head coach for the Insight Bowl, a 38–21 loss to Oregon State. =Washington= On December 13, 2004, Willingham was hired as the new head coach at Washington, succeeding Keith Gilbertson. The Huskies returned 19 of 22 starters from the previous season, in which they had gone 1–10 (0–8 in conference play). Willingham's primary task was to change the program's image, which had been marred by off- the-field problems under Rick Neuheisel. He instituted a strict hair policy and was known to occasionally show up in his players' classes unannounced to make sure they were attending.Perry, Rick, and Ken Armstrong. Emmert: \\"You can win, and you can win properly\\" The Seattle Times, 2008-01-30. 2005 As chance would have it, Willingham found himself facing his former team on September 24, 2005. Notre Dame prevailed, 36–17. His first season at Washington ended with a 2–9 record (1–7 in conference play, tied for 9th place), capped by a scuffle after a close loss to Washington State that left Willingham \\"embarrassed\\" and vowing that it would not happen again. 2006 His 2006 Washington team started October with a 4–1 record, with its most notable victory a stunning 29–19 upset over previously undefeated UCLA, before losing its next 6 games after starting quarterback Isaiah Stanback suffered a season ending foot injury in a loss to Oregon State in their sixth game. The Huskies ended the season at 5–7 (3–6 in conference play, 9th place), this time defeating state rival Washington State (WSU) by three points. This win held WSU from defeating the Huskies for three years in a row, something that has never happened in the history of the century-long rivalry. 2007 The 2007 Washington Huskies football team faced what a preseason CBS Sports opinion piece called \\"the toughest schedule in the country\\" Washington went on to a 4–9 record overall (2–7 in conference play, 10th place) with wins against Syracuse, Boise State, Stanford, and California. There was considerable debate after the season over whether Willingham should be fired as no other coach in the history of the program had ever tallied three straight losing seasons. Washington State won the Apple Cup again, making it 3 out of the last 4. In the end, it was decided that he would return for the upcoming season with the expectation that the team become more competitive. Additionally, several boosters were pleased at Willingham's effort to clean up the program. 2008 Willingham's stiff demeanor resulted in a somewhat acrimonious relationship with fans, boosters, and the Seattle media. The turning point came at the end of his third (losing) season when there was a big question as to whether he would be retained. However President Emmert gave him a vote of confidence and he was retained for a fourth year. The 2008 season started off inauspiciously with #21 Oregon defeating Washington 44–10. This marked the first time Oregon had ever beaten Washington five times in a row in the history of the century-long rivalry. The second game against #15 BYU was a nail biter and Washington scored the final touchdown in the final minute. The PAT would have tied the game, however an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was called against quarterback Jake Locker who had thrown the ball up in the air in celebration after scoring the touchdown. This moved the PAT attempt to 35 yards which was blocked and the BYU escaped with a 28–27 victory. In the next game, the Huskies were dismantled 55–14 by the #3 Oklahoma Sooners, giving the overmatched Huskies their greatest margin of defeat at home since 1929. In the fourth game, the Huskies lost to Stanford leaving them as the only winless team in a BCS conference. The Huskies were without a sack, leaving them as the only school without a sack at this point of the season. It was the second 0–4 start in the last five years and only the fourth time ever in the history of the program. Starting quarterback Jake Locker was lost for the season, injuring his left hand during a block on a reverse. In the fifth game, Arizona put Washington away early and the game ended with a 48–14 wipeout of the Huskies. This was the biggest margin of victory by Arizona over Washington ever, and started a watch of just how bad the team could get. The Huskies had a flat performance in their sixth game to lose to Oregon State 34–13. This was the fifth consecutive loss to the Beavers, something that had never happened in the long history of the series. Game 7 was another loss versus his former team Notre Dame. The Huskies were nearly shutout in suffering a 33–7 loss that left them 0–7 and ineligible for a bowl game yet again. On October 27, 2008, seven games into the 2008 season, Willingham announced that his contract was being terminated and he would be leaving UW after the regular season.Willingham to step down as Huskies coach at season's end, Associated Press, October 27, 2008, Accessed October 27, 2008. Game 8 was a shutout by USC. At 0–11, Washington was the only winless team in the FBS, and the owner of a 13-game losing streak stretching from the last season. Washington closed out the season with a loss at 1–10 Washington State in double-overtime, making it four of the last five, and with a season ending loss at California. Willingham finished the season with an 0–12 record, the Huskies' first winless season in 119 years. His .229 winning percentage is the worst in school history. After coaching and family In 2014, Willingham was named as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee. Willingham also volunteered as a coach on the Stanford women's golf team in 2011.https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/5-for-friday-tyrone- willingham-notre-dame-stanford-coach-playoff-selection-committee-090514 Willingham served as President on the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) Board of Trustees in 2008. On July 18, 2010, at the age of 56 and nearly two years after he had coached his last game, Willingham announced he was retired from coaching. Willingham is married and has three children, Cassidy, Kelsey and Nathaniel, with his wife, Kim. Cassidy was a gymnast at the University of Denver and Kelsey was a softball player at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Along with Rudolf Carnap, Hans Reichenbach, and Carl Hempel, he is sometimes seen as one of the major figures of the logical positivist movement. His, 1961 book The Structure of Science is considered a foundational work in the logic of scientific explanation. Life and career Nagel was born in Nové Mesto nad Váhom (now in Slovakia, then Vágújhely and part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). His mother, Frida Weiss, was from the nearby town of Vrbové (or Verbo). He emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with his family, and became a U.S. citizen in 1919. He received a BSc from the City College of New York in 1923, and earned his PhD from Columbia University in 1931, with a dissertation on the concept of measurement. Except for one year (1966-1967) at Rockefeller University, he spent his entire academic career at Columbia. He became the first John Dewey Professor of Philosophy there in 1955. And then University Professor from 1967 until his retirement in 1970, after which he continued to teach. In 1977, he was one of the few Philosophers elected to the National Academy of Sciences. His work concerned the philosophy of mathematical fields such as geometry and probability, quantum mechanics, and the status of reductive and inductive theories of science. His book The Structure of Science (1961) practically inaugurated the field of analytic philosophy of science. He expounded the different kinds of explanation in different fields, and was sceptical about attempts to unify the nature of scientific laws or explanations. He was the first to propose that by positing analytic equivalencies (or \\"bridge laws\\") between the terms of different sciences, one could eliminate all ontological commitments except those required by the most basic science. He also upheld the view that social sciences are scientific, and should adopt the same standards as natural sciences. Nagel wrote An Introduction to Logic and the Scientific Method with Morris Raphael Cohen, his CCNY teacher in 1934. In 1958, he published with James R. Newman Gödel's proof, a short book explicating Gödel's incompleteness theorems to those not well trained in mathematical logic. He edited the Journal of Philosophy (1939–1956) and the Journal of Symbolic Logic (1940-1946). As a public intellectual, he supported a skeptical approach to claims of the paranormal, becoming one of the first sponsors and fellows of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 1976, along with 24 other notable philosophers like W. V. Quine. The committee posthumously inducted him into their \\"Pantheon of Skeptics\\" in recognition of Nagel's contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. He died in New York. He had two sons, Alexander Nagel (professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin) and Sidney Nagel (professor of physics at the University of Chicago). Nagel's doctoral students include Morton White, Patrick Suppes, Henry Kyburg, Isaac Levi, and Sidney Morgenbesser.

His sermons were the foundation of Polish political doctrine that culminated in the system of Nobles' Democracy (\\"Golden Liberty\\") in Poland and, from 1569, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.Krzysztof Ożóg: Stanisław ze Skarbimierza - uczony w służbie Królestwa Polskiego „Miłujcie światło mądrości, którzy jesteście przełożonymi narodów” (Księga Mądrości 6, 23) (pol.)

History The Winnemem are one of what anthropologists have hypothesised to be nine total bands of Wintu. They are not a federally recognized tribe, although they are working toward federal recognition. Some Winnemem Wintu feel that it is by government error rather than termination that the Bureau of Indian Affairs does not recognize them. And some Wintu representatives, of Winnemem heritage, have been informed by Interior Officials that it was \\"Bureaucratic Oversight\\" that resulted in the entire Wintu being omitted from the list of federally recognised tribes as early as the 1940s. Forty-two Winnemem men, women and children were killed by white settlers at Kabyai Creek, on the McCloud River, in 1854. This action is known as the Kaibai Creek Massacre. Around the late 19th century and early 20th century, local militias were awarded $5 for proof of every Native American person killed. Direct link to audio file. Since 1945, portions of the lower McCloud River have been flooded by Shasta Lake, the reservoir created by the Shasta Dam. In 1971, a group of Winnemem Wintu occupied Toyon-Wintu Center, a government-owned property where housing had been built for dam construction workers. They were granted a temporary permit to remain at the site in 1973, but the government moved to evict the thirty remaining Wintu residents in 1988, completing the eviction in 1989. The Winnemem Wintu are currently in a protracted fight with State of California and the federal Bureau of Reclamation over the proposed raising of the height of Shasta Dam to secure more water for California cities and agriculture; the Winnemem Wintu argue that the proposed higher lake level would flood many Winnemem Wintu sacred sites. From September 12 to 16, 2004, one faction of Winnemem Wintu held a \\"war dance\\" as a protest. They claim it was the first war dance held since 1876. The Winnemem Wintu claim important sacred sites on Mount Shasta and Cold Spring Mountain. They are one of several groups of Native Americans who feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out, and refuse to participate in the gaming industry. Today the Winnemem Wintu are divided politically into several groups, with members participating in at least three organized groups attempting to obtain federal recognition. In addition, there are several Winnemem Wintu descendants who decline to participate in these groups for various reasons. The Winnemem healer Florence Jones (Puilulimet) (1907–2003) was portrayed in a nationally broadcast PBS documentary, In the Light of Reverence, in 2001, as she successfully led her community's fight to stop construction of a new ski resort on sacred Mount Shasta.  Language  The Winnemem Wintu traditionally spoke the North Eastern Dialect of the Northern Wintun Language, a member of the Wintuan languages, and a member of the larger Penutian language \\"stock\\". Chief Caleen Sisk has been working with linguist Stefan Liedtke and the Indigenous Language Institute on revitalization of the Winnemem Wintu language.  Federal recognition  One Winnemem Wintu group argues that they were accidentally erased from the Bureau of Indian Affairs list of recognized tribes during the 1980s. They have not been able to regain this recognition. Legislation sponsored by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell in 2004 gave these Winnemem Wintu the opportunity to regain recognition. However, the Winnemem Wintu were informed that the group's inclusion on an omnibus bill related to all Native American tribal people would have put the entire bill at risk. Rather than have other tribal people put at risk, the Winnemem Wintu agreed with Senator Campbell to remove their name from the bill.

He was the father of the author and journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. Muggeridge was born the son of a Penge undertaker on 26 June 1864. When the family was abandoned by his father, Muggeridge left school and began work as an office boy in the City of London. The little money he kept for himself was spent on books, and it was his avid lunchtime reading that led to a keen interest in politics. His second job was again as an office boy for a firm of shirtmakers, where he stayed until he retired. He eventually became Company Secretary, but had turned down a directorship, as he felt it would be at odds with his political principles. In 1893, Muggeridge married Annie Booler, the daughter of a Sheffield factory foreman, and they had five sons, Malcolm being the middle child. Malcolm would later describe his father as a small bearded man with a large frame, a twinkling eye, and a rather bulbous nose. One of Malcolm's quoted memories of his father is of his visits to the Surrey Street Market, where he would set up his platform and expound his views on the need for socialism: \\"Now ladies and gentlemen. It's His Majesty's Government, His Majesty's Navy, His Majesty's Stationery Office, His Majesty's this and His Majesty's that. But it's the National Debt. Why isn't that His Majesty's? We'll gladly let His Majesty have that, won't we?\\" Muggeridge's early interest in politics at first led to his joining the Penge Liberals, and with them he campaigned for local improvements. By his late twenties he was a socialist, and he joined first the Fabians, then the Independent Labour Party. An excellent public speaker, he founded and became secretary of the Croydon Socialist Society in 1895, and stood for the Croydon Borough Council in Norwood in 1896 and 1897. He was not to be successful until November 1911, although Croydon had already had several Labour councillors. Muggeridge was the first President of Ruskin House, the Labour and Trade Union centre in Croydon, having been instrumental in its relocation and refounding. Muggeridge remained a Croydon councillor until 1930, at which time he also became a Justice of the Peace. He was instrumental in getting Croydon's first council houses built and campaigned for Trade Union rates of pay for all municipal employees. Although he stood for Parliament in Croydon South four times, in 1918, 1922, 1923, and 1924, Muggeridge finally became a member of parliament for Romford in 1929. He lost his seat in 1931 and returned to Croydon Council in 1933, retiring in 1940, at the age of 75. He died in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1942 and was buried in Whatlington, near Battle, East Sussex.

Its principal centre of worship was dedicated to the invocation of the saint, the single-belfry Church of Santo António (which was unique at the time for having only one belltower, as compared to the other churches on the island). The church was dotted with a valuable retable located in the presbytery, elaborated in thin guildwork and its stoic large images dedicated to St. Anthony and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In addition, the parish included several hermitages dedicated to their respective saints, including the Hermitage of São Vicente, the Hermitage of Santa Ana, the chapel of Santo António da Furna, the Church of Santo António and the Império of the Divine Holy Spirit of Santo António, which all characterize the history of their localities. Geography Santo António is one of the northern parishes of the municipality of São Roque do Pico; the administrative division, in the form of a trapezoid extends from the northern coast into the interior, partially dividing the mountain of Pico with its neighbours.

Born in Northamptonshire, the son of Thomas Tresham of Sywell, he went on to become a major landowner in the region. He was elected as a Knight of the shire for the parliament of 1423, and again in 1427, 1429, 1432, 1433, 1435, 1439, 1442, 1445, 1447 and February and November 1449, serving in twelve successive parliaments overall. In 1424 he was also appointed a Justice of the Peace for Northamptonshire; a man born of common stock relied on advancement in his home county for advancement nationally. Having trained as a lawyer, Tresham spent intermittent periods in the service of the king, such as in 1415, when he reviewed the accounts of the King's officials in southern Wales. It is assumed he concentrated on his legal career in the 1420s, where there are few records of his activities, but in 1430 he was appointed as a councillor to Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and continued to receive a salary until at least 1447. In 1432 he was made one of the two Attorneys-general of Henry Beaufort, and spent much of the 1430s on various commissions of the crown, including one to Northamptonshire in 1434 to investigate the hiding of royal funds, and another in 1439 to look at the value of royal lands, again in Northamptonshire. He was employed by the royal household as an apprentice-at-law and thus secured a tie with them; this is likely why he was elected Speaker of the House of Commons for the 1439 Parliament, when there were attempts to reform the King's household. In 1438 he bought Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire as a family seat. He was again elected Speaker in 1442 and 1447 and continued his royal service, mainly for the Duchy of Lancaster, and worked as an Apprentice-at-law between 1444 and 1447. He was made a feoffee of the duchy estates in 1446 and in 1448 was made a chancellor of those feoffees, followed by an appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 3 June 1442. He was much-liked at court, and as a result was appointed to politically sensitive cases, such as the 1444 commission to investigate charges of treason against Thomas Carver, and a 1447 commission directed at members of the household of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. In 1450 he was himself indicted for treason in the aftermath of Jack Cade's rebellion in Kent, but before any sort of commission could take place he was murdered. While travelling to meet with Richard of York with his son, Sir Thomas Tresham, the pair were assaulted by a group of local men with whom Tresham was in a property dispute. William was killed, and Thomas escaped injured.

In the middle of 2020, the company was rebranded as \\"Thrivent.\\" Predecessor groups Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States. =Aid Association for Lutherans= Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945. History In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.Alvin J. Schmidt, Fraternal Organizations. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1980, pp. 25-26. In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin, broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.Thrivent Financial Historic Timeline They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each. In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group. It was chartered on November 24, 1902, as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States. Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.Schmidt, p. 26. 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members. Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927. Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1.2 million members in 5,019 branches in 1978.Schmidt, pp. 26-27. By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country. Rituals The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.  Non-profit organization The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called \\"lodges\\" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin.Schmidt, p. 27. Philanthropy The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action. =Lutheran Brotherhood= History The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society. As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or \\"lodges\\" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.Schmidt, p. 210. The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the state of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920. The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose: \\"To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.\\"Philip K. Strand & Hakala Associates, A Common Bond: The Story of Lutheran Brotherhood. Minneapolis: Lutheran Brotherhood, 1989. Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979. Rituals Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths. Non-profit Organization Local units were called \\"branches\\", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.Schmidt, p. 211. Philanthropy The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics. =Mergers= Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life. Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario. The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches. Thrivent Financial for Lutherans The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

In 1978, it published the first graphic novel intended for the newly created comic book specialty store market. It was one of the first to offer royalties and creator ownership of rights, and the first comics company to publish trading cards. History The company was founded as Eclipse Enterprises by brothers Jan and Dean Mullaney in 1977. Eclipse published one of the first original graphic novels, and the first to be sold through the new \\"direct market\\" of comic-book stores, Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species by Don McGregor and Paul Gulacy. Published in August 1978, it led to a 14-issue spin-off series for Eclipse. McGregor went on to write two additional early graphic novels for Eclipse, each set in contemporary New York City and starring interracial-buddy private eyes Ted Denning and Bob Rainier: Detectives, Inc.: A Remembrance of Threatening Green (1980), with artist Marshall Rogers, and Detectives, Inc.: A Terror Of Dying Dreams (1985), with artist Gene Colan, who would become a frequent collaborator. The company had early success with the anthology magazine Eclipse and color comic Eclipse Monthly, as well as with the detective series Ms. Tree by Max Allan Collins.

With Yronwode as editor-in-chief during a period of expanding attention to the art form, Eclipse published many innovative works and championed creators' rights in a field which at the time barely respected them. During Yronwode's tenure, Eclipse published superhero titles including Miracleman by Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, The Rocketeer by Dave Stevens, and Zot! by Scott McCloud. and also brought out graphic novels featuring opera adaptations, such as The Magic Flute by P. Craig Russell and children's literature such as an adaptation of The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. In 1985, Yronwode and cartoonist Trina Robbins co-wrote the Eclipse book Women and the Comics, on the history of female comic strip and comic book creators.

Controversial political subjects such as the Iran- Contra scandal, the Savings and Loan crisis, the AIDS epidemic, and the Kennedy Assassination, as well as true crime accounts of serial killers, mass murderers, the Mafia, and organized crime were covered in these card sets.Crossen, Judith. \\"Trading Card Fame for S&L; Scoundrels\\", Reuters via Philadelphia Daily News, September 9, 1991Trausch, Susan. \\"A Full Deck of Scandals at a Glance\\", Boston Globe, September 18, 1991\\"Insider Trading with Keating, Milken\\", Los Angeles Daily News, October 20, 1991Jones, Kathryn. \\"Price tag on JFK intrigue Assassination aficionados spawn cottage industry\\",The Dallas Morning News, November 22, 1991\\"Kennedy Assassination is an Industry with Growing Market\\", Associated Press via The Chronicle-Telegram (Elyria, Ohio), November 28, 1991\\"Ban Urged on Sale of Crime Cards\\", The Record (Bergen County, New Jersey), April 30, 1992\\"'True Crime' Cards Thriving Despite Outrage\\", The New York Times, June 16, 1992\\"Killer Cards Hit Capital Stores Amid Criticism\\", Sacramento Bee, June 19, 1992\\"Killer Cards: Two groups trying to deal fatal blow to criminal cards\\", The Oregonian, August 18, 1992\\"AIDS cards to include condoms\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (newspaper), September 23, 1992)\\"AIDS Awareness is in the cards\\", Dallas Morning News, July 7, 1993\\"AIDS Activism turns to cards\\", Dayton Daily News, July 13, 1993\\"Ban Sought on Cards depicting AIDS victim\\", Boston Globe, January 15, 1994 = 1986 flood = In February 1986, Eclipse lost most of its back-issue stock in a catastrophic Guerneville flood, which also submerged the company's offices. = Acme Press = In 1988 Eclipse created a new division, Eclipse International, as it partnered with the British independent publisher Acme Press to distribute Acme's comics in the American market. (Eclipse had previously partnered with British publisher Dez Skinn when it had published Miracleman.) Highlights from the Acme/Eclipse era included Power Comics, a four-issue superhero title by writers Don Avenall and Norman Worker, with art by Dave Gibbons and Brian Bolland. The title was originally published in Nigeria in 1975, and the title's character's names was changed from \\"Powerman\\" to \\"Powerbolt\\" to avoid confusion with the character Luke Cage (also called \\"Power Man\\"), published by Marvel Comics. Another notable title from the Acme/Eclipse era was Aces, a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized Jazz Age genre stories which were originally published in Europe. Eclipse also distributed Acme's two-issue anthology Point Blank, which promoted itself as \\"The Best of European Strip Art\\". In 1989 Acme acquired the comics license for James Bond.Curson, Natasha. \\"Acme – take two Earthquake Pills and exit over cliff...,\\" Natasha Curson blog (August 18, 2010). Acme and Eclipse co-published the official graphic novel adaptation of Licence to Kill,Conroy, Mike (2004). 500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes. London: Chrysalis Books Group. , p. 293. with art by Mike Grell, and then published Grell's three-issue series James Bond: Permission to Die — the first James Bond comic book storyline not adapted from a previous work — from 1989 to 1991. Eclipse also distributed Acme's three-issue licensed limited series Steed and Mrs. Peel in 1990–1992, by such notable creators as Grant Morrison and Ian Gibson. In 1990 Acme teamed with Eclipse to release Eddie Campbell's The Complete Alec,Yang, Sam. \\"A Loaf of Bread, A Jug of Wine and Eddie Campbell,\\" The Comics Journal #145 (Oct. 1991), p. 59. which collected three previous \\"Alec\\" publications — Alec (1984), Love and Beerglasses (1985), and Doggie in the Window (1986) — together with some unpublished material. The collection won the 1991 UK Comic Art Award for Best Graphic Novel Collection.\\"British Awards Announced,\\" The Comics Journal #142 (June 1991), p. 17. Eclipse's arrangement with Acme lasted until 1991. = Viz Communications = In 1988, in partnership with Viz Communications and Studio Proteus, Eclipse published some of the earliest English-translated Japanese manga, such as Area 88, Mai, the Psychic Girl, and The Legend of Kamui. With the success of these titles, the manga line was expanded. = Decline = After-effects of the 1986 flood, Mullaney and Yronwode's 1993 divorce, and the mid-1990s evolution of the direct market distribution system caused the company to cease operations in 1994. and file for bankruptcy in 1995. The company's intellectual property rights were later acquired by Todd McFarlane for a total of $25,000. Mullaney also attributed the company's demise to a problematic contract with the book publisher HarperCollins. Eclipse's last publication was its Spring 1993 catalog, which was a complete bibliography of its publications.

The offensive began on May 12, 1898, when the United States Navy attacked the capital, San Juan. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans were able to establish a blockade in the city's harbor, San Juan Bay. On June 22, the cruiser Isabel II and the destroyer Terror delivered a Spanish counterattack, but were unable to break the blockade and Terror was damaged. The land offensive began on July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Major General Nelson A. Miles disembarked off the coast of Guánica. After controlling the first skirmish, the Americans advanced to Coamo, where they engaged Puerto Rican and Spanish troops in battle. The battle concluded when the allied soldiers retreated after the battle left two dead on their side, and four on the American side. The United States was able to seize control of Fajardo on August 1, but was forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican–Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition as they advanced towards the main island's interior. They engaged in two crossfires in Guamani River and Coamo, both of which were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated. A battle in San Germán concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to Lares. On August 9, 1898, American troops that were pursuing units retreating from Coamo and Asomante encountered heavy resistance in Aibonito and retreated after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. After about an hour of fighting, Spanish artillery batteries had been silenced. American guns advanced some 2,150 yards and set up positions, but soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and the guns were withdrawn back to the main line. Shortly before the launch of a flanking movement on the Spanish, all military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.  Prelude  Alfred T. Mahan In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker, wrote a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea which would serve as coaling and naval stations, and serve as strategical points of defense upon the construction of an Isthmusian canal.\\"Strategy as Politics'; by: Jorge Rodriguez Beruff; Publisher: La Editorial; Universidad de Puerto Rico; page 7; This idea was not new, since William H. Seward, the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents, among them Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant, had stressed that a canal be built either in Honduras, Nicaragua or Panama and that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive the approval of the U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars which the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba. Mahan made the following statement to the War Department: \\"Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in war will be like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair, would be one of the first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea.\\"A.T.Mahan, \\"The Influence of Sea Power upon History (1660–1783)\\", London: Sampson Low, Marston, Seale; page 83 Flag of the Batallón Provisional No. 3 de Puerto Rico (3rd Provisional Battalion of Puerto Rico) Since 1894, the Naval War College had been formulating plans for war with Spain. By 1896, the Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan which included military operations in Puerto Rican waters. Not only was Puerto Rico considered valuable as a naval station, Puerto Rico and Cuba were also abundant in a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked: sugar. Strategy as Politics by: Jorge Rodriguez Beruff; Publisher: La Editorial; Universidad de Puerto Rico; page 13; On February 15, 1898 USS Maine exploded and sunk in Havana Harbor, Cuba. According to the Navy's leading weapons expert, Philip Alger, the explosion was due to a coal fire igniting a reserve magazine of six tons of gunpowder, much of which was already degrading due to the humid climate. However, the United States forwarded an ultimatum to Spain to withdraw from Cuba following the sinking of Maine. In response, Spain broke off diplomatic relations with the United States, and on April 23, 1898 Spain declared war. On April 25, the U.S. Congress declared that a state of war between the United States and Spain had existed since April 20. One of the United States' principal objectives in the Spanish–American War was to take control of Spanish possessions in the Atlantic—Puerto Rico and Cuba—and their possessions in the Pacific—the Philippines and Guam. On April 27, U.S. ships, the monitor , the armored cruisers , and , bombarded the Spanish fortifications at Matanzas Bay in Cuba. By July 16, an armistice was signed at the Arbol de La Paz (a large ceiba tree) in Santiago de Cuba by U.S. and Spanish forces ending hostilities in Cuba and its waters. The United States then directed its undivided military resources to Puerto Rico. Two leaders of the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, Dr. Julio J. Henna and Roberto H. Todd, had written to U.S. President McKinley asking that Puerto Rico be included in whatever intervention was planned for Cuba as early as March 10. They even provided the U.S. government with information about the Spanish military presence on the island. = Spanish preparations = Manuel Macías y Casado On April 21, 1898 the Gazette of Puerto Rico () published a decree signaling martial law for the island, suspending all constitutional rights in the preparation for war. With the outbreak of war, the Spanish Crown sent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican provisional battalions to defend Cuba against the Americans, depleting the Puerto Rican troops in the island. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Cavalry and Krupp artillery, was sent to Santiago de Cuba where they battled the American forces in the Battle of San Juan Hill. After the battle, the Puerto Rican battalion suffered a total of 70 casualties which included their dead, wounded, missing and prisoners. The Spanish appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Manuel Macías y Casado, declared martial law, resolving to resist the American forces. He declared: \\"Providence will not permit that in these countries which were discovered by the Spanish nation the echo of our language should ever cease to be heard, nor that our flag should disappear before the eyes. ... Long live Puerto Rico, always Spanish. Long live Spain.\\" Macías y Casado hoped that a grant of autonomy would ensure that Puerto Ricans would remain loyal to the Spanish crown. = American preparations = Edwin Emerson Jr. Map drawn by Rudolph Riefkohl and given to Edwin Emerson, Jr. On May 24, 1898, in a letter to Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge wrote, \\"Porto Rico is not forgotten and we mean to have it\\". The Spanish Crown was unaware that, at the time, the United States had successfully infiltrated the island with a number of spies, among them Henry Howard Whitney, Henry Ward, George Bronson Brea, William Freeman, James Dewel, Frederick Ober and Edwin Emerson, Jr. According to a story published in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was pretending to be a German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was published in the Century article.\\"Alone in Puerto Rico, by Edwin Emerson, Jr., Century Magazine, Vol. 56, Issue 5, pp. 666–676, September 1898  The naval campaign in Puerto Rico (May 8–August 13)  = First actions = Ordoñez 15 cm cannon which opened fire on Yale The first engagement between the belligerents occurred on May 8, 1898, when the converted liner captured a Spanish freighter, Rita, in San Juan Bay. On May 9, Yale fought a brief battle with Alfonso XIII, a Spanish auxiliary cruiser, resulting in a Spanish victory. Around this time, Captain Ángel Rivero Méndez was assigned the command of the Spanish forces at the fortress of San Cristóbal in San Juan. On May 10, when Yale returned to San Juan Bay, Rivero-Méndez ordered his men to open fire on the steamer with an Ordoñez 15 centimeter cannon, in the first attack against American forces in Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. For his actions, Rivero-Mendez was awarded the \\"Cruz de la Orden de Merito Militar\\" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class. = Bombardment of San Juan = Rear Admiral William T. Sampson during the Spanish–American War The Bombardment of San Juan or the First Battle of San Juan (not to be confused with the Battle of San Juan Hill or the Battle for the Río San Juan de Nicaragua) refers to an American naval attack on the fortifications of San Juan, Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. The American Naval commanders believed the bulk of the Spanish Fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete was steaming from the Cape Verde Islands to the Antilles and ultimately to Puerto Rico. With this understanding, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson and a squadron of ten American warships, the battleships , , , cruisers and , monitors and , torpedo boat , two unidentified auxiliary cruisers, and an unarmed collier had stood out from Havana at noon on May 2 bound for Puerto Rico. Sampson intended to intercept and destroy the Spanish squadron and then move on to attack secondary shore targets- San Juan's castles, forts and batteries. He was unaware that Topete had already eluded them and slipped his squadron into the Bay of Santiago. Bombardment On May 12, Sampson's squadron arrived at San Juan, finding an empty harbor. Making the best of the situation and as an exercise for his untested gunners, Sampson ordered the bombardment of the city's citadels. Captains Ramón Acha Caamaño and José Antonio Iriarte were among those who defended the city, from Castillo San Felipe del Morro. They had three batteries under their command, which were armed with at least three 15 cm Ordóñez cannons. The battle lasted three hours and resulted in the death of Justo Esquivies, the first Puerto Rican soldier to die in the Puerto Rican Campaign. Caamaño was awarded the \\"Cruz de la Orden de Merito Militar\\" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class for his actions. After causing much damage to the Spanish defenses and receiving minor damage, low on coal and ammunition, Sampson ordered a cease fire and returned to Havana, Cuba and then on to Key West, Florida for repairs and supplies. = Second Battle of San Juan = Bombardment of San Felipe del Morro On June 22, 1898, under the command of Captain Charles Sigsbee arrived at San Juan Bay from Cuba and joined the blockade. Shortly after midday the old Spanish cruiser set off from San Juan to engage Saint Paul with support from shore batteries. Isabel II opened fire on Saint Paul at long range without success in an attempt to break the blockade. , a Spanish destroyer docked in San Juan for repairs, attempted to cover the cruiser's escape with a torpedo attack but was thwarted when her rudder was damaged by a direct hit from Saint Paul. Losing steerage, Terror inadvertently turned broadside, allowing Saint Paul to score direct hits near Terrors waterline, disabling one of her engines and causing her to list. Terror abandoned the attack and returned to port, followed by Isabel II. On June 26, USS Saint Paul was relieved by , which continued the blockade of San Juan Bay. = Third Battle of San Juan = Captain Angel Rivero Mendez On June 28, 1898, the American auxiliary cruiser fought with a squadron of Spanish warships. This squadron consisted of one cruiser, two gunboats and one blockade runner. During the engagement, SS Antonio López, a transoceanic steamer belonging to the Compañía Transatlántica Española carrying a cargo of needed military supplies, was pursued by Yosemite until the Spanish freighter ran aground at Ensenada Honda, Puerto Rico with her valuable cargo.Berta Pensado, El Marqués de Comillas (1954) Capt. Caamaño was in charge of retrieving the ship's cargo and the men under his command quickly removed as much of the stranded ship's cargo as possible. The desperate efforts proved fruitful, and nearly the entire cargo was salvaged from the hulk with only minor articles and a cannon that had fallen overboard during salvage attempts being lost. On 15 July, the cruiser arrived to relieve Yosemite, and the quickly finished off Antonio Lopez the next day by firing twenty incendiary shells into the vessel and sinking it. Though Antonio Lopez had been sunk, her cargo was successfully delivered and ensured that any American assault on San Juan would be met with stronger resistance. Caamaño was awarded the \\"Cruz de la Orden de Merito Naval\\" (The Cross of the Order of the Naval Merit) by the Spanish government. The residents of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez and blamed him for the destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments. Nothing came of those recriminations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.  The land campaign in Puerto Rico (July 25–August 13)  = Landing in Guánica = Lt. General Nelson A. Miles The Spanish forces expected the Americans to attack the northern region of the island and concentrated their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo. The Spanish government was also aware of a planned landing by the Americans at Fajardo, located on the east coast and had that town fortified. However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all. After Cuba was taken, President William McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico by way of Fajardo, taking into consideration that the Spaniards had fortified San Juan, where they expected the initial attack. A convoy of ships left Tampa, Florida and on July 21 another convoy, which included USS Yale, USS Massachusetts, USS Gloucester and USS Dixie, departed from Guantánamo for a four-day journey to Puerto Rico. Major General Miles traveled aboard USS Yale. While approaching the Mona Passage that separates Puerto Rico from the island of Hispaniola to the east, Miles opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, choosing Guánica as his landing zone. Miles dispatched patrol boats to notify all other convoys of his decision and to order them to proceed to Guanica. Miles' decision to change the invasion site was based on his belief that the town of Fajardo would be fortified and he feared that Spanish coastal gun boats would disrupt a landing at Fajardo. Guánica Lighthouse c.1893 On July 25, General Miles, 1,300 infantry soldiers of the 3,300 total that were assigned for the initial invasion and a convoy of ships, under the command of Naval Captain Francis J. Higginson of arrived at Guánica Bay. The following Navy ships and Army troopships were part of the convoy: USS Yale with Generals Miles and George A. Garretson embarked, carrying General Guy V. Henry, , , , and the U.S. Army transports Lampasas, Unionist, Stillwater and Specialist. Two captured Spanish ships, Nueces and Rita that had been confiscated by USS Yale as war prizes were also used. In 1898, Guánica was a small barrio within the jurisdiction of the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and its only defense was eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique Méndez López. When the Guánica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera spotted the approaching convoy, he immediately gave the alert to the residents of the barrio. All of the residents, with the exception Agustín Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan María Morciglio, Simón Mejil, Salvador Muñoz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena who welcomed the invaders, abandoned their homes and joined Rivera on his journey to Yauco where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city's mayor. = First skirmish = Gloucester landing team Gloucester was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica. Twenty-eight sailors and Marines, under the command of Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. Méndez López and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez López and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco. = Invasion = General Nelson Miles and other soldiers on horseback in Puerto Rico. After the skirmish was over, men from Lampasas landed on the beach to secure the area and to build a landing dock. 3,300 American soldiers under the command of General Miles landed. The units that landed were the 6th Volunteer Regiments of Illinois and Massachusetts, an Artillery battalion, five battery companies, two engineer companies and a medical unit. The men who had not abandoned the barrio of Guanica swore allegiance to the United States. Garretson named Agustín Barrenechea mayor of Guanica and Simón Mejil the chief of police. On the afternoon of the 25th, Garretson left Guánica with seven companies of the 6th Massachusetts and one company of the 6th Illinois and headed towards Yauco. Secretary of War Russell A. Alger learned about the landing at Guanica the next day when he read an Associated Press report in a local Washington, D.C. newspaper. The War Department had ordered Miles to invade Puerto Rico by way of San Juan and therefore Alger was completely surprised with the report. Miles would have been subject to disciplinary actions had the invasion not gone so smoothly. Alger received the following cable from Miles three days after the invasion: \\"Spanish troops are retreating from southern part of Puerto Rico. This is a prosperous and beautiful country. The Army will soon be in mountain region. Weather delightful; troops in the best of health and spirit. Anticipate no insurmountable obstacles in future results. Results thus far have been accomplished without loss of a single life. = Battle of Yauco = alt= After Rivera, the keeper of the Guánica lighthouse, notified Atilio Gaztambide, the mayor of the town of Yauco, located north of Guánica, of the American invasion of Guánica, the mayor in turn notified Governor Macías via telegraph. Governor Macías ordered Captain Salvador Meca and his 3rd company of the 25th Patria Battalion from Yauco to head for Guánica. Meca and his men were joined by Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, who assumed command of the Spanish forces at Hacienda Desideria from Guánica. Puig arrived with two companies known as \\"Cazador Patria Battalion\\", and they were joined by Puerto Rican volunteers, the Civil Guards, and mounted guerrillas from the towns of Yauco and Sabana Grande. Puig had the men positioned on both sides of the road that ran from Guánica to the coffee Hacienda Desideria (owned by Antonio Mariani) in Yauco, as well as an infantry company positioned on a hill south of the hacienda. In the meantime, Garretson, set out of Guánica with his men towards Yauco with the intention of capturing the Yauco rail terminus that ran between that town and the City of Ponce, the largest city in the southern region of the island. Garretson and his men arrived in the darkness of night and was informed by his scouts of the possibility of a hostile situation at the Hacienda Desideria. He ordered the Illinois company and two companies (companies L and M) of the 6th Massachusetts to occupy a small hill on his right that overlooked the hacienda. Part of the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, where the Battle of Yauco took place in 1898 Captain San Pedro detected the movements of the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating the right wing of the Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead. 19th century train station in Yauco Puig and his men retreated towards Yauco, but failed to destroy the rail terminus which connected the town to the city of Ponce, and proceeded to march towards the town of Peñuelas. Garretson's troops entered Yauco in the afternoon of July 26 and on July 27 Puig's men continued their march, leaving their artillery and heavy equipment behind, passing the towns of Adjuntas and Utuado and finally arriving at the town of Arecibo on the northern coast of the island on July 29. Col. Puig, believing that he would be dishonored and accused by the Spanish Government of abandoning military equipment during his retreat, committed suicide on August 2. Miles, upon learning about the lack of discipline of the 6th Massachusetts during the battle, ordered an investigation. The 6th Massachusetts was sent on a hard march from Guánica to Ponce as punishment and the regimental commander, a lieutenant colonel, a major, and a captain resigned upon request. = Battle of Fajardo = Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan (Cape San Juan lighthouse), c. 1898. It is located on the northeastern part of the highest point of Cape San Juan in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. On August 1, the monitors , , armed tug , and collier were sailing off the coast of Fajardo on the northeast corner of Puerto Rico, when Captain Frederick W. Rodgers, Puritans commanding officer and senior officer afloat, spotted the \\"Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan\\" (Cape San Juan Lighthouse) that had been designated the landing site for the US Army's invasion of Puerto Rico. Rodgers ordered a reconnaissance landing party ashore, including Puerto Rican volunteers. The sailors advanced to within a of Fajardo, about from the coast, but withdrew when they encountered Spanish troops. The 25-man Spanish garrison stationed in Fajardo was alerted to the American presence and ordered to withdraw after notifying their superiors in San Juan. When Dr. Santiago Veve Calzada, a Fajardan, realized that the garrison was abandoned and his town defenseless against the Americans, he implored the Spanish authorities in San Juan to dispatch troops to defend Fajardo. Losing hope that Spanish troops would come to the town's aid, Veve went to the lighthouse to seek protection for the town from the Americans. On the afternoon of August 5, Veve entered Fajardo with a contingent of bluejackets and United States flags were hoisted over the Fajardo Customs House at the harbor and City Hall. On the evening of August 6, Captain Charles J. Barclay of Amphitrite ordered 28 sailors and 7 officers commanded by Lt. Charles N. Atwater and Assistant Engineer David J. Jenkins ashore to relight and occupy the Fajardo Light. They were also ordered to quarter 60 women and children of the town's families that were deemed in danger for having sided with the Americans. As the first group of sailors was entering the darkened lighthouse, Naval Cadet William H. Boardman was mortally wounded when his revolver fell from a faulty holster and discharged into his thigh, cutting the femoral artery. His was one of only two Navy deaths during the Puerto Rican campaign. On August 4, Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino and about 220 troops, including civil guardsmen to recapture the city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on August 7, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo Light and the surrounding hills. At close to midnight on August 8, Pino's troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of Amphitrites sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and signaled the ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. After two hours, the Spanish forces retreated back to the town. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close call when a wayward naval shell smashed through the thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of six men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were two dead and three wounded, including a lieutenant. Early the next morning, Barclay decided the continued occupation of the lighthouse was of marginal value and ordered his men back to the ship. A landing party of 30 sailors from Amphitrite and a similar number of U.S. Marines from under Lieutenant John A. Lejeune came ashore to secure the area while the 60 Fajardan civilians boarded Leyden for passage to Ponce and the lighthouse was abandoned to the Spaniards. In Fajardo, Pino's men tore down the U.S. flags that flew over the harbor Customs House and City Hall, returning to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned. The contingent of about 20 civil guards that had accompanied Pino, were left to maintain order in the town. The skirmish at Fajardo was the only time that American forces withdrew from a position during the Puerto Rican Campaign. = Battle of Guayama = US troopships and convoy at Playa de Ponce, 1898 After the town of Yauco was taken, Miles decided to attack the City of Ponce by sea and by land. Garretson's 6th Illinois and 6th Massachusetts had returned to Guanica and after the troops rested, Garretson and his men were ordered to move eastward to Ponce. Lt. Col. Rafael Martinez Illecas, in charge of the Spanish forces in that city, had pulled out, leaving behind a small garrison of 300 volunteers to hold the town. When the American forces arrived in Ponce they met no resistance and the Spanish volunteers surrendered. The American forces were not the only ones who participated in the taking of Ponce. Members of the Puerto Rican Commission, which included the leader of the Intentona de Yauco revolt, Antonio Mattei Lluberas and his group, arrived in Ponce aboard USS St. Louis and were assigned to the headquarters of General Miles. From this group Miles organized the \\"Porto Rican Scouts\\", which was later assigned to General Theodore Schwan, under the command of Edwardo Lugo Viñas. Miles then ordered Brigadier General Peter G. Hains and the men of the 3rd Illinois, 4th Ohio and 4th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiments to take Arroyo, a small port east of Ponce that served the larger, nearby coastal town of Guayama. Arroyo was taken on August 2 and on August 5 Hanes ordered the 4th Ohio, the 3rd Illinois and a battery of Sims- Dudley guns, manned by Company G of the 4th Ohio, to capture Guayama. Spanish forces were entrenched on the crest of two small hills, between which the road from Arroyo to Guayama ran. The Americans had crossed a stream in front of the hills when suddenly the Spanish opened fire. The Americans protected their position by the stream and increased their firepower as more reinforcements arrived. The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as the Americans made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama. General John Rutter Brooke used the Cautiño Residence (Casa Cautiño) by the town square in Guayama as his military headquarters.  Battle of the Guamaní River Bridge  On August 6, Colonel Coit sent two companies of the 4th Ohio on a reconnaissance mission across and beyond a cast iron bridge that crossed the Río Guamaní (Guamaní River). The road beyond the bridge was essential for General Hains' projected advance to the town of Cayey. The 4th Ohio observed elements of Spain's 6th Provisional Battalion under the command of Julio Cervera Baviera entrenched in Guamaní Heights, six miles north of the bridge. The 4th felt that they were too strongly entrenched to attempt an assault at the time. The 4th Ohio requested reinforcements and on August 9, attacked the Spaniards and a short firefight erupted. The numerical superiority of the Americans forced the Spanish to retreat from Guamaní Heights. This battle was the costliest battle yet for the Americans since their landing at Guánica, as it resulted in seven wounded. The Spanish forces suffered 2 dead and 15 wounded. = Battle of Coamo = The 3rd Wisconsin awaits orders to charge the Spanish at Coamo Shortly after the American soldiers disembarked, a group of Spanish and Puerto Rican units began moving from Ponce to Aibonito, marching through the Carretera Central (Central Road). The caravan was composed of two companies of the Batallón de Cazadores de la Patria (Battalion of the Motherland's Hunters) and some members of the Civil Guard and a Puerto Rican guerilla force. A total of 248 infantry men and 42 members of the cavalry formed the battalions under the command of Lt. Col. Rafael Martínez Illescas, the same commander who was in charge of the Ponce garrison. Traveling by foot, the journey would last two days. The group decided to spend one night in the resort of the town of Coamo known as the Baños de Coamo before continuing their march in the morning. Martínez Illescas immediately ordered the construction of several trenches; while building these, the soldiers were ambushed by an anti-Spanish guerilla force, led by Pedro María Descartes, who managed to kill a member of the Civil Guard. Spanish and Puerto Rican prisoners of war after the Battle of Coamo Meanwhile, two battalions of volunteers from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, led by Generals Oswald H. Ernst and James H. Wilson, settled on opposite sides of the road to Coamo. On August 9, 1898, the Americans began their offensive, opening cannon fire against the city and completing their attack with artillery fire, the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Baños, damaging the resort. The Americans intended to encircle and defeat the defenses in the city. A group of soldiers entered the city from the backside, having advanced through a river nearby. The rear assault was reinforced by Wilson's army under General Ernst, attempting to trap the allied soldiers in a crossfire, employing a tactic known as the pincer movement. Martínez Illescas was surprised by the attack and led an improvised attack, but he was killed in the crossfire along with his second- in-command, leaving Captain Hita in charge; he ordered his men to surrender. Half of the allied troops ignored the order, and continued the attack, Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Baños de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. Hita's men were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp located at Río Descalabrado, while the men who continued to attack retreated to Aibonito when they realized that the Americans were using a pincer movement. = Battle of Silva Heights = Col. Julio Soto Villanueva (X) with his staff in Mayagüez Brigadier General Theodore Schwan and 2,896 men of his Independent Brigade had landed in Guanica and marched towards occupied Yauco. Schwan and his men were ordered to move westward and to capture the city of Mayagüez. Colonel Julio Soto Villanueva ordered 1,500 Spanish Regulars of the 24th Rifle Battalion, six companies of the Alfonso XIII auxiliaries, and other scattered Spanish and Puerto Rican guerilla forces dispatched from the garrison at Mayagüez to meet and defeat Schwan. The Spanish forces entrenched themselves at a high ridge called Silva Heights, located at a road near the town of Hormigueros. Schwan's troops arrived in the town of San Germán and continued the march towards their objective. Troop A of Schwan's 5th Cavalry approached Silva Heights and were soon engaged in a firefight when the Spanish forces opened fire. The Americans were aided by two companies of the 19th Infantry, supported by artillery and Gatling guns, as well as the 11th Infantry. The Spanish forces retreated after the American reinforcements brought them under intense fire. Schwan's men set up camp on Silva Heights for the night and the following day they continued their drive to Mayagüez. They arrived the following morning to find that the Spanish forces had abandoned the city to retreat to the east towards Lares. Schwan did not follow Soto Villanueva, but instead was ordered to take the town of Las Marías. The outcome of the Silva Heights Battle left 3 Spanish dead, 6 wounded, and 136 prisoners. Schwan's brigade suffered 15 wounded and 2 killed in action.https://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type;=Person&ID;=405039 = Battle of Asomante = Spanish trenches in Asomante The American cavalry pursued the soldiers that had retreated from Coamo, but were not able to reach them until the units had entered Aibonito Pass, a region more commonly known as Asomante. The region had been prepared by allied Puerto Rican and Spanish troops, who had built a trench and placed soldiers and equipment around the foliage. As soon as the soldiers noticed the presence of the invading unit they opened cannon fire. The cavalry received infantry reinforcements, which were received by battery fire. Six American soldiers were injured in the crossfire, prompting a retreat order. The allied units (Spanish and Puerto Rican) lost five soldiers and two civil guards. During the following two days the Americans decided to do a battlefield reconnaissance and Colonel S. Reber, developed a croquis of the Aibonito Pass. Spies were deployed throughout Coamo, including a Puerto Rican separatist named Carlos Patterne, who was able to enter the city without suspicion and contact Rufino Huertas, a separatist teacher. Huertas gave Patterne a series of defense plans that were previously developed and organized by Martínez Illescas. While inactive, the Puerto Rican soldiers deployed in Asomante completed rounds every two hours, working four hours daily. They mostly ate beans, some rice and meat, while conserving several cracker packs for Spanish reinforcements that were supposed to arrive. They slept in improvised huts that did not protect them from the rain. The American commanders decided to attack the trenches with artillery, while sending a large group to Barranquitas, from which they would try to attack the allied troops from the back. At 10:30 a.m. Captain R.D. Potts led part of the 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment through the central highway to Aibonito. Lieutenants Bliss and O'Hern led two units with similar equipment. At 1:00 p.m. the allied troops opened cannon fire as the Americans entered their range. Potts ordered the deployment of two batteries while O'Hern received orders from Commander Landcaster to set a cannon at a distance of a 100 yards to the vanguard's right. They intended to defeat a small group led by Captain Hernaíz. Shrapnel from allied cannon fire was falling close to Lancaster's location, and he asked Potts to help him by deploying a battery nearby. One of Hernaíz's Placensias cannons overheated, which forced him to order a temporary cease to the offensive.\\" Landcaster believed that the opposition had been annihilated, ordered an advance. However, the allied fire was renewed, this time supported by Mauser rifle fire. The sudden attack caused confusion among some soldiers, who reported seeing a second Spanish unit nearby.\\" Fearing that the allied units could capture the American equipment, Landcaster ordered a retreat. Lieutenant Hains was gravely injured by a Mauser bullet, being replaced by Sergeant John Long. Meanwhile, most of Potts' men fled the battlefield. In the crossfire the allied forces overpowered the American infantry, using Mauser fire to disorganize their artillery, during which time four American officials were gravely injured including Long, Lieutenant Harris, Captain E.T. Lee and Corporal Oscar Sawanson.\\" Private Frederick Yough, Corporal August Yank, George J. Bruce and Private Sices also received injuries, with Yough subsequently dying. Harris' position was filled by O'Hern, while Sawanson was fatally shot while trying to support the artillery. In total the allied units had only an injured artillery man, while the American side had two dead and five injured. Wilson's camp was the first to receive a telegram from General Miles notifying him that the war had ended. The Americans sent Bliss to Asomante, but Nouvilas refused to suspend the hostilities after receiving a telegram from Macías denying any peace treaty. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended August 13, after President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territory of Puerto Rico.  Aftermath  = Treaty of Paris of 1898 = In an 1898 newspaper cartoon, 'Uncle Sam\\" watches as the 'Goddess of Liberty\\" heralds 'freedom\\" for Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines The Puerto Rico Campaign, which began with Yaless capture of Rita on May 8 and ended on December 10, after the Treaty of Paris was signed, was short compared to the other campaigns in the Spanish–American War, because the war came to an end before the military objective of the campaign was completed. Among the factors which benefited the invaders in the short campaign was that the Puerto Ricans who resided in the southern and western towns and villages resented Spanish rule and tended to view the Americans as their liberators. The Treaty of Paris came into effect on April 11, 1899, when the documents of ratification were exchanged. Some Puerto Rican leaders such as José de Diego and Eugenio María de Hostos expected the United States to grant the island its independence and in the case of Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and the committee which he headed, greeted General Miles and the invaders in Ponce with banquets.El Nuevo Dia Believing that Puerto Rico would gain its independence, a group of men staged an uprising in Ciales which became known as \\"El Levantamiento de Ciales\\"El levantamiento de Ciales, by Juan Manuel Delgado, Editorial Guasábara, 1980. or the \\"Ciales Uprising of 1898\\" and proclaimed Puerto Rico to be a republic. The Spanish authorities who were unaware that the cease fire had been signed brutally suppressed the uprising.Projecto Salon Hogar , Retrieved December 20, 2008 Another reason which can explain why the campaign was short and not as violent as the others is that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions were in Cuba defending that island against the American invaders. In a 1899, newspaper cartoon the people of Puerto Rico as well as the people of the new possessions of the United States were depicted as black savage children. As stated in the introduction, the Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70 casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners. The Spanish, Puerto Ricans and Americans that participated in the campaign totaled 33,472. Of this total 18,000 were Spanish, 10,000 were Puerto Rican and 15,472 were American military personnel. The Spanish and Puerto Rican suffered 429 casualties which included 17 dead, 88 wounded and 324 captured. The American forces suffered 43 casualties: 3 dead and 40 wounded. The commander of Spain's 6th Provisional Battalion, Julio Cervera Baviera gained notoriety as the author of a pamphlet called La defensa de Puerto Rico, which supported Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado and in an attempt to justify Spain's defeat against the United States, blamed the Puerto Rican volunteers in the Spanish Army as the reason behind the fiasco.Frances Negrón-Muntaner, Boricua Pop: Puerto Ricans and the Latinization of American Culture (New York: NYU Press, 2004), 11. A group of angry Sanjuaneros agreed to challenge Cervera to a duel if the commander did not retract his pamphlet. The men drew lots for this honor; it fell to José Janer y Soler and was seconded by Cayetano Coll y Toste y Leonidas Villalón. Cervera's seconds were Colonel Pedro del Pino and Captain Emilio Barrera. The duel never took place, as Cervera explained his intentions in writing the pamphlet, and all parties were satisfied. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, ratified on April 11, 1899, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. Spain had lost its last colony in the Western Hemisphere and the United States gained imperial strength and global presence. The United States established a military government and appointed Miles the first head of the military government established on the island, acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs. Members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain. By October 18, the Spanish withdrawal from Puerto Rico was completed as the final troops left San Juan for Spain. Those who belonged to the Spanish military who decided to stay in Puerto Rico were offered the option by the United States to serve in the newly formed \\"Porto Rico Regiment\\". Some took the offer, such as Teófilo Marxuach, a former Lieutenant in the Spanish Army who joined the regiment, and others, such as Capt. Angel Rivero Méndez, declined the offer and retired from the military. =\\"Americanization\\" of Puerto Rico = An 1899, caricature by Louis Dalrymple (1866–1905), showing Uncle Sam harshly lecturing four black children labelled Philippines, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Cuba From 1898 to 1900, Puerto Rico was governed by four military officers, Commanding General Nelson A. Miles (1898), Major General John R. Brooke (1898–1898), Major General Guy Vernon Henry (1898–1899) and Major General George Whitefield Davis (1899–1900). Some of these men, such as Miles, Brooke and Henry were experienced veterans of the Indian Wars and, even though they were accustomed to the pacification and administration of the Native Americans, the U.S. Army had no previous experience in the administration of overseas territories.Strategy as Politics by: Jorge Rodriguez Beruff; Publisher: La Editorial; Universidad de Puerto Rico; page 18–19; Henry stated: \\"It was an entirely new duty for American Army officers. There was no precedent in the experience of these so suddenly placed in charge of this our first real colony, upon which their policy could be based.\\" The administration of Puerto Rico was the responsibility of the United States Department of War's Division of Insular Affairs which was molded after the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Almost immediately, the United States began the 'Americanization\\" process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico's economy and polity and did not apply democratic principles to the colony. Puerto Rico was classified as an 'unincorporated territory\\" which meant that the protections of the United States Constitution did not automatically apply because the island belonged to the U.S., but was not part of the U.S. In 1899, U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar described Puerto Ricans as \\"uneducated, simple-minded and harmless people who were only interested in wine, women, music and dancing\\" and recommended that Spanish should be abolished in the island's schools and only English should be taught. Schools became the primary vehicle of Americanization, and initially all classes were taught in English, which also made for a large dropout rate. On January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico (On May 17, 1932, U.S. Congress changed the name back to \\"Puerto Rico\\") and the island's currency was changed from the Puerto Rican peso to the American dollar, integrating the island's currency into the U.S. monetary system. The United States exerted its control over the economy of the island by prohibiting Puerto Rico from negotiating commercial treaties with other nations, from determining tariffs, and from shipping goods to the mainland on other than U.S. carriers. = Civil disorder = Raising the U.S. Flag over San Juan, October 18, 1898 A state of civil disorder existed in the island's mountainous region after the invasion of the United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas\\". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca\\". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the influence of alcohol, and get into fights with the local residents.1898-La Guerra Despues de la Guerra by: Fernando Pico; Publishers: Ediciones Huracan; The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army. = End of military rule and rise of the sugar economy = Military rule was replaced by a civilian government by way of the Foraker Act of 1900. However, the Act stipulated that the governor, chief of police and top officials were presidentially appointed and they were all to be Americans. In 1901, the first civilian U.S. governor of Puerto Rico, Charles Herbert Allen, installed himself as president of the largest sugar-refining company in the world, the American Sugar Refining Company. This company was later renamed as the Domino Sugar company. In effect, Charles Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy.Ribes Tovar et al., p.122-144 = 54 years after the end of the Puerto Rican Campaign = In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor, which it first exercised in 1948. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, and approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year. Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado (literally translated as \\"Free Associated State\\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic.Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico – in Spanish (Spanish) .  Markers, monuments and tombstones  Rock in Guánica which indicates where Major General Nelson A. Miles and his men landed In Puerto Rico there are no monuments to commemorate the Spanish–American War as such. There are various markers where some of the historical events took place and some tombstones which honor both the American invaders and the Spanish and Puerto Rican defenders of the island. In the town of Guánica there is a rock on the coastal port with an inscription indicating that Major General Nelson A. Miles and his men landed on that spot. There is also a monument in the town dedicated to the veterans of the Spanish–American War, however said monument fails to specify to which veterans it is dedicated to, the Americans or the Spanish/Puerto Ricans. In Yauco there is a monument/tombstone dedicated to an unknown Spanish soldier who had fallen in combat and was left there on that very spot. In Coamo there are two markers that indicate where Rafael Martínez Illescas and Frutos López died. López's tomb is located in the old cemetery of Coamo next to that of the tomb of the three unknown Puerto Rican soldiers who perished in that conflict. Martínez Illescas' body was transferred in 1916, to his hometown Cartagena in Spain where he is buried. The town of Guayama has a monument dedicated to the members of the 4th Ohio Infantry. In Asomante, there is a marker which indicates the place where the \\"Battle of Asomante\\" took place.

The municipality is located is on the southern part of the Pico Island. The population in 2011 was 4,711,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 155.31 km².Eurostat It is bordered by Madalena to the west and by São Roque do Pico to the north. History The first settlement to be established on the southern part of the island of along Penedo Negro, in the cove of Castelete (south of the actual town of Lajes) sometime around 1460. The rough seas at the time only allowed the navigator Fernando Álvares Evangelho to offload at the time, and he and his dog would occupy the land near the ravine (along the western edge of the town) for many years: the ravine of potable water took its name Ribeira Fernado Álvares from this early colonist. His former residence still remains near the site. When his colleagues arrived later, they disembarked farther east in the area designated Santa Cruz das Ribeiras. A few remain at this site, including Jordão Álvares Caralta, while other stayed along the coast, near Maré (named for the local tidal pool). In addition to their homes, they constructed the small Hermitage of São Pedro, where its first priest was friar Pedro Gigante, whom some historians consider the first person to introduce the Verdelho caste to the islands. The town of Lajes never received a foral (charter) typical of continental settlements; in 1500, the first municipal chamber was composed of various good men of stature in the community and by charter (dated 14 May 1501) the Captain-Donatary Jôs d'Utra conferred power and authority to Fernando Álvares to assigned licenses to various settlers in his name, for the monarchy of Portugal. Lajes was the first municipality on Pico and, until 1542, the only one on the island. Lacerda Machado, in Espelho Cristalino estimated that the population was no more than about 250 inhabitants by 1506. From this point, Lajes do Pico was constituted by a few parishes: among them were São João, Santíssima Trindade (Lajes do Pico), Calheta de Nesquim and Piedade. In 1540, the municipality of Lajes (which constituted all of the island) included the parishes of Santa Bárbara (Ribeiras), Santíssima Trindade (Lajes), São Mateus, Santa Maria Madalena, São Roque e Nossa Senhora da Ajuda. Over time, though, this island- wide governmental authority would be ceded to local constituent authorities, as the populations grew and demanded autonomy from distant Lajes, who understood little of their regional demands. In 1542, King D. John III decided to divide the municipal in two, constituting the municipality of Vila Nova de São Roque, with its parishes of São Roque (seat of municipal authority), Nossa Senhora da Ajuda and Madalena. Its first constituent assembly was seated in 1543. It would be several decades before the municipality of Madalena would be a distinct local authority: on 8 March 1723, the parishes of Madalena (town), Bandeiras and São Mateus would become its own authority. Extinguished in 1895, the municipality would nevertheless be reestablished on 13 January 1898 by royal decree. Álvaro de Ornelas, then the first Captain-Donatary for the island of Pico (similar to a Civil Governor) never arrived on the island, and never took power. Jôs d'Utra (Jobst de Van Huertere), then Donatary-Captain of Faial, took over this role in 1482, as the Captaincy of Pico. :When the first men arrived on the Island, the found a raised stone, that was vomitted by the volcanoes: colossal stones, huddled at random, like those which are loosened over the pebbles and cliffs of the coast. But the bastards raised their foreheads.

The initiator usually does not provide any Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs). On the other hand, a SCSI target is the endpoint that does not initiate sessions, but instead waits for initiators' commands and provides required input/output data transfers. The target usually provides to the initiators one or more LUNs, because otherwise no read or write command would be possible. Detailed information Typically, a computer is an initiator and a data storage device is a target. As in a client–server architecture, an initiator is analogous to the client, and a target is analogous to the server. Each SCSI address (each identifier on a SCSI bus) displays behavior of initiator, target, or (rarely) both at the same time. There is nothing in the SCSI protocol that prevents an initiator from acting as a target or vice versa. SCSI initiators are sometimes wrongly called controllers. See the SCSI host adapter article for a more detailed description of initiator's operation. Other protocols Initiator and target terms are applicable not only to traditional parallel SCSI, but also to Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), iSCSI (see iSCSI target), HyperSCSI, (in some sense) SATA, ATA over Ethernet (AoE), InfiniBand, DSSI and many other storage networking protocols. Address versus port In most of these protocols, an address (whether it is initiator or target) is roughly equivalent to physical device's port. Situations where a single physical port hosts multiple addresses, or where a single address is accessible from one device's multiple ports are not very common, . Even when using multipath I/O to achieve fault tolerance, the device driver switches between different targets or initiators statically bound on physical ports, instead of sharing a static address between physical ports.

It is their first album of new material since Open in 2001. It was released on Latent Recordings in Canada, and Zoë Records internationally.  Album development  The album title emerged from a quote from John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath: \\"Maybe it's all men and all women we love; maybe that's the Holy Sperit – the human sperit – the whole shebang. Maybe all men got one big soul ever'body’s a part of.\\" The idea behind One Soul Now is that everyone is interconnected. While the Cowboy Junkies was touring to support Open, the band members started collecting second-hand recording equipment without a plan or purpose, just a need. When the band was back home, they looked at all the recording studios, and decided to set up the recording equipment in their rehearsal area, eventually turning their space into a recording studio, The Clubhouse. One Soul Now is the first album the band made in their new studio. Having their rehearsal space become their recording studio changed the process of creating their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio when ready. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process. Later, when they listened to the recordings, the Junkies could pick out the recording where the songs were most vibrant. Per the band, \\"For example \\"He Will Call You Baby\\" was recorded as the band was learning the arrangement and still unsure; \\"No Long Journey Home\\" was a trial run through with embellishments added later; \\"The Stars of Our Stars\\" was broken down into individual instruments and recorded piece by piece over the course of many weeks…\\" The band's ninth studio album is their first album recorded without an outside producer or engineer. One song, \\"Simon Keeper\\", was recorded much earlier, during the Open sessions at Daryl Smith's recording studio, Chemical Sound. The Cowboy Junkies also recorded a 5 song bonus EP of cover songs that they labeled 'neath your covers, part 1. They gave away the bonus CD free with every purchase of the One Soul Now CD while supplies lasted.

Influenced by various financial scandals and accidents, along with the report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the bill was introduced to Parliament by Richard Shepherd and given government support, on the condition that it become an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996. After receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July 1998, the Act came into force on 2 July 1999. It protects employees who make disclosures of certain types of information, including evidence of illegal activity or damage to the environment, from retribution from their employers, such as dismissal or being passed over for promotion. In cases where such retribution takes place the employee may bring a case before an employment tribunal, which can award compensation. As a result of the Act, many more employers have instituted internal whistleblowing procedures, although only 38 percent of individuals surveyed worked for a company with such procedures in place . The Act has been criticised for failing to force employers to institute such a policy, containing no provisions preventing the \\"blacklisting\\" of employees who make such disclosures, and failing to protect the employee from libel proceedings should his allegation turn out to be false. Under the Act a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) between an employer and employee, often a condition of compensation for loss of employment for some reason, does not remove a worker’s right to make a protected disclosure, i.e. to blow the whistle. In 2019 a consultation was held on adding limitations on confidentiality clauses, following evidence that some employers used confidentiality clauses to intimidate victims of harassment or discrimination into silence, suggesting that the worker did not have the right to blow the whistle, take a matter to a tribunal, or even discuss with people such as the police, a doctor, or a therapist. Background Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no protection against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for breach of confidence thanks to a public interest defence, that did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal,Gunasekara (2003) p.43 failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because of a series of financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns,Gunasekara (2003) p.41 and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.Lewis (1998) p.325 In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right.Lewis (2005) p.239 Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill.Calland and Dehn (eds) (2004) Whistleblowing Around the World: Law, Culture and Practice, ODAC, PCaW and the British Council, p. 105 The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation. The Public Interest Disclosure Bill was introduced to the House of Commons by Shepherd in 1997, and given its second reading on 12 December before being sent to a committee. After being passed by the Commons it moved to the House of Lords on 27 April 1998, and was passed on 29 June, receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July and becoming the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Originally scheduled to come into force on 1 January 1999, the Act instead became applicable law on 2 July. Contents Section 1 of the Act inserts sections 43A to L into the Employment Rights Act 1996, titled \\"Protected Disclosures\\". It provides that a disclosure which the whistleblower makes to their employer, a \\"prescribed person\\", in the course of seeking legal advice, Ministers of the Crown, individuals appointed by the Secretary of State for that purpose, or, in limited circumstances, \\"any other person\\", is protected. In addition, the disclosure must be one which the whistleblower \\"reasonably believes\\" shows a criminal offence, a failure to comply with legal obligations, a miscarriage of justice, danger to the health and safety of employees, damage to the environment, or the hiding of information which would show any of the above actions. These disclosures do not have to be of confidential information, and this section does not abolish the public interest defence; in addition, it can be the disclosure of information about actions which have already occurred, are occurring, or could occur in the future. In Miklaszewicz v Stolt Offshore Ltd,[2001] IRLR 656(EAT) the Employment Appeal Tribunal confirmed that the disclosure does not have to have been made after the Act came into force; it is sufficient for the dismissal or other persecution by the employer to have happened after that time. The list of \\"prescribed persons\\" is found in the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons) Order 1999,Lewis (2005) p.125 and includes only official bodies; the Health and Safety Executive, the Data Protection Registrar, the Certification Officer, the Environment Agency and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. An employee will be protected if he \\"makes a disclosure in good faith\\" to one of these people, and \\"reasonably believes that the relevant failure...is a matter in respect of which the person is prescribed and the information is substantially true\\".Craig (1999) p.2 Other prescribed persons include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, in relation to \\"acts or omissions which have an actual or potential effect on the environment... including those relating to pollution\\".Craig (1999) p.3 If an employee makes such a disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. That includes both negative actions and the absence of action and so covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided.Lewis (1998) p.328 If an employee suffers a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof. If an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when he discusses redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.Lewis (1998) p.329 Under Section 8, the Secretary of State could pass a statutory instrument setting out the rules and limits surrounding compensation for the employee's dismissal after making a protected disclosure; until this is done, Section 9 provided interim remedies, which were the same as in other cases of unfair dismissal. The Secretary of State passed such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed under Section 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Under Section 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting under Section 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom. Assessment and impact Terry Corbin, writing in the Criminal Law and Justice Weekly, notes that the result of the Act has been that many more employers have developed internal processes for reporting issues, partially because desire to fix problems before they become publicly reported and partially because if employees choose not to use those processes and instead act under the 1998 Act, there is a greater chance that the employer can depict their behaviour as \\"unreasonable\\".Corbitt (2003) p.3 However, a survey done by Public Concern At Work showed that in 2010, only 38 percent of those surveyed worked for companies with whistleblowing policies in place, and only 23 percent knew that legal protection for whistleblowers existed. The number of cases brought by whistleblowers to employment tribunals has increased more than tenfold, from 157 in 1999/2000 to 1,761 in 2008/9.Lewis (2010) p.1 David Lewis, writing in the Industrial Law Journal, highlights what he perceives as weaknesses in the legislation. Firstly, it does not force employers to make a policy relating to disclosures. Secondly, it does not prevent employers from \\"blacklisting\\" and refusing to hire those who are known within the industry to have made disclosures in previous jobs. The complexity of the law was also criticised, as was the fact that if such a disclosure turns out to be incorrect, the employee may be sued for libel by his employer.Lewis (1998) p.330 Volunteers and self-employed people are not covered, and the same goes for those who, in disclosing the information, commit a criminal offence.Gobert (2000) p.38 Also, the law does not make any provision for psychological harm caused by whistleblowing, which research shows is common.Gobert (2000) p.46 See also * Eileen Chubb References Bibliography   United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1998 ","title":"Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998"},{"id":"1216899","text":"Ellerslie town centre from the east Ellerslie is a suburb of the city of Auckland, in the North Island of New Zealand. Ellerslie lies seven kilometres to the southeast of the city centre, close to State Highway 1. Administratively, Ellerslie forms part of the Ōrākei Local Board, which also includes the suburbs of Orākei, Mission Bay, Kohimarama, Saint Heliers, Glendowie, St Johns, Meadowbank and Remuera. To the west, Ellerslie borders on the One Tree Hill area and Cornwall Park. Largely a residential suburb, the area is arguably best-known as the site of Auckland's main horse-racing venue, Ellerslie Racecourse, as well as the original site of the Ellerslie Flower Show. (From 2008 the Flower Show moved to Christchurch in the South Island.) History =The Development of Ellerslie= The suburb was named by early local politician and entrepreneur Robert Graham, after his father's home in Elderslie (sic) in Renfrewshire, Scotland. Graham arrived in Auckland in October 1842 as an assisted immigrant from Scotland. Retrieved 2013-10-05. In 1848 Graham bought two blocks of land where, after his marriage to Sophia Swann in 1852, he built the ‘Ellerslie House’ as a family homestead. Adjacent to this home was a track along which Mrs Graham was in the habit of riding her horse every morning, now a street called Ladies Mile. Many of the local streets bear names of Graham family members. In 1873 the railway from Auckland was extended to reach Ellerslie. It is likely that Graham developed part of his property as the 'Ellerslie Zoological Gardens' because of this development. The gardens included flower beds, fountains, a bandstand, dance pavilion and a zoo. This made Ellerslie a popular leisure centre for Aucklanders. In 1886 much of the Graham farm was subdivided for housing. Horse races were already being held in Ellerslie since 1857, but in 1886 the Racing Club acquired a permanent site from the Graham family, including the Zoological Gardens. The racecourse had its own railway station for race days, and was a prominent feature of the Ellerslie area up until its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s. Next to Ellerslie Train Station a small township developed, servicing not only the local residents but also the race day crowds. As the 20th century progressed the surrounding rural land disappeared and Ellerslie became absorbed into suburban Auckland. The building of the Southern Motorway was to both strengthen the strategic location already created by the railway, as well as weaken the local cohesion of the area because of the physical divide the motorway created. The original local authority was Ellerslie Town District, established in 1908. The Borough of Ellerslie was formally declared on 1 April 1938. In 1989 Ellerslie was amalgamated into Auckland City Council. The area has seen strong population growth in the recent past, growing 32% in the inner Ellerslie area between 1991 and 2001.Draft Ellerslie’s Future Framework (Auckland City Council, 2006. Accessed 2008-06-28.) Ellerslie is now a desirable suburb with convenient access to the city centre for commuting (via rail and bus links) and ready access to the nearby Southern Motorway for road users. The town centre is pleasant with good services, while retaining a sense of community. Housing in the area is well planned and close to a number of attractive parks, such as Michaels Avenue Reserve and Waiatarua Reserve. =Singing Caves= Māori gave the name ‘Waiatarua’ to the site which later became the Ellerslie Racecourse. Translated as \\"two songs\\" the name refers to a waiata or song that emanated from caves. It was believed that this ‘singing’ was created by water and air blowing from a larger cave into a smaller passage, making a vibrating sound. In the 1960s a new grand stand was constructed at the racecourse and the caves were filled with concrete to create a seal. This was not wholly successful, and it is said that the singing could still be heard coming from the caves. =The Town Centre= The Ellerslie Town Centre is on Main Highway near where it intersects with the Ellerslie-Panmure Highway. The construction in the 1960s of the Southern Motorway cut Ellerslie off nearby Greenlane, resulting in a downturn in trade and many empty shops. However, in the 2000s, Ellerslie recovered with a strong upturn in employment in the nearby business parks on the southern side of the motorway (connected to the area with a pedestrian overbridge). The overbridge was the location of the opening scene of the New Zealand film Once Were Warriors (film). In 2006, the overbridge was transformed with a ‘Bridge of Memories’ mosaic storyboard portraying different landmark buildings, houses (past and present), and images from the local schools. Thanks to the long-term strategy of the local business association, it is now increasingly oriented towards lunchtime shoppers and again has many prosperous smaller businesses. =The Ellerslie Meteorite= At 9.00 am on 12 June 2004 a meteorite crashed through the roof of the home of the Archer family in Ellerslie. Retrieved 2013-10-01. The meteorite landed into the living room of the house, bouncing off the couch and hitting the ceiling. The home owners heard an explosion and saw dust everywhere, but nobody was hurt. This meteorite is officially named the Auckland Meteorite, despite tradition demanding that a meteorite is named after the nearest post office. However, an Ellerslie Meteorite had already fallen in Australia. Retrieved 2013-10-01. The rock weighs 1.3 kg and is estimated to be around 4,600 million years old. Retrieved 2013-10-01. It is the ninth meteorite found in New Zealand and the first to hit a home. Retrieved 2013-10-01. According to Auckland University experts, a meteorite that crashes through a roof is a very rare event. This meteorite received world-wide attention and an American collector offered the Archer family $50,000 for the space rock. The Archers declined this offer, favouring the public display of the rock in New Zealand, so that anyone interested could view it. The meteorite has been since on display in the Auckland Museum, where it can be seen in the Origins Gallery. =The Ellerslie Flower Show= The Ellerslie International Flower Show was first held in Ellerslie in 1994 at the Ellerslie Racecourse. This is New Zealand’s annual garden show. After 3 years in Ellerslie, it moved to the Auckland Botanic Gardens in Manurewa, Auckland. Retrieved 2013-10-02. In 2008 the Flower Show moved again, this time to Hagley Park in Christchurch. Retrieved 2013-10-02. Demographics Ellerslie, comprising the statistical areas of Ellerslie Central, Ellerslie West, Ellerslie East and Ellerslie South, had a population of 9,186 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 456 people (5.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,149 people (14.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 3,174 households. There were 4,467 males and 4,722 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 1,695 people (18.5%) aged under 15 years, 1,926 (21.0%) aged 15 to 29, 4,566 (49.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 999 (10.9%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 64.8% European/Pākehā, 6.9% Māori, 5.9% Pacific peoples, 28.9% Asian, and 3.8% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 39.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 46.9% had no religion, 36.6% were Christian, and 11.7% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 3,195 (42.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 531 (7.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,584 (61.2%) people were employed full-time, 927 (12.4%) were part-time, and 216 (2.9%) were unemployed. Local government Ellerslie had a local government like other suburbs of Auckland. The local government was called Ellerslie Borough Council. It started in 1938 and eventually merged into Auckland City Council in 1989 and then merged into Auckland Council in November 2010. =Mayors during Ellerslie Borough Counil= *Horace James White, 1938–1956 *Lloyd Elsmore, 1956–1962 *Alan Trevor Bell, 1962–1974 *William Edgar Brewster, 1974–1980 *William \\"Bill\\" James Cann, 1980–1981 *Leon Clarence Leicester, 1981–1989 Landmarks and features =The Ellerslie Race Course= Spectators at Ellerslie Racecourse, 1908 Ellerslie Racecourse, 1908 The Ellerslie area has been known as the centre for horseracing since New Zealand’s first race meeting was organised there in 1842.

History U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at the NGA 2020 winter meeting In 1907, the Inland Waterways Commission thought it necessary to ask the Conference of Governors to provide both state and national views relating to practical questions dealing with natural resources utilization and management in the Progressive Era.Inland Waterways Commission Recommendations...

In his Memphis address on October 4 the President announced the intention of calling such a conference, and on November 13 he issued invitations to the governors of the States and Territories to meet at the White House May 13–15, 1908;...\\" The NGA represents the governors of the fifty U.S. states and five U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). It is funded primarily by state dues, federal grants and contracts, and private contributions.FAQ National Governors Association website, \\"How is NGA funded?\\" Retrieved Dec 8, 2013. The NGA serves as a public policy liaison between the state governments and the federal government. NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on Capitol Hill and at the White House when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting networking seminars for state executive branch officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and best practices on issues that range from education and health to technology, welfare reform, and the environment. NGA also provides management and technical assistance to both new and incumbent governors. NGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA chair alternates yearly between Republican and Democratic governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is usually of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year. The current NGA chair is Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, a Democrat. The vice chair is Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican. Arkansas' Bill Clinton is, to date, the only former chair of the organization to become president of the United States. Janet Napolitano of Arizona became the first female chair in 2006. In February 2020, Mike Pompeo warned the National Governors Association that the Communist Party of China was actively attempting to influence U.S. policy through state governors and local officials. Chairs Formally adopted as policy in 1977, chairs preside for a one-year term and alternate party affiliation, so the same party never serves for two terms in a row. The following states have never produced an NGA chairperson: Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Dakota; nor have any of the five territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" -

It is endemic to southeastern United States of America. Description The shadow bass, has a lateral line containing 36 to 42 scales. There are 11 spines and 11-12 soft rays in the dorsal fin while the anal fin contains 6-7 spines and 10-11 soft rays. It has a large mouth with the maxilla at the level of the centre of its eye. They are olive to light brown in color and there are frequently 2-4 dark brown vertical bands and blotches along their flanks. The dorsal, anal and iris is reddish, and the pupil is deep blue. There is a black band which runs from beneath the eye onto the gill cover. The spots on the scales of the shadow bass are triangular while the similar rock bass has rectangular spots on its scales. The shadow bass is a medium sized sunfish which has an average standard length of around and a wmaximum length of and weight of . Females normally live longer than the males but the males are faster growing and grow larger. Geographic distribution The shadow bass' native range includes the southeastern United States from the Apalachicola River drainage in Georgia to the lower Mississippi basin in Louisiana. The two isolated populations in the St. Francis, Black Arkansas Red, and upper Ouachita River drainages in Missouri and Arkansas in the Ozark regions. In Tennessee, the shadow bass can be found in most drainages south of the Tennessee River. Other river drainages that shadow bass inhabit are Blackwater and Chattahoochee Rivers in southern Georgia and northern Florida. The apparent absence of shadow bass in Black Belt streams is probably the result of low stream flow and poor water-quality conditions during the late summer when temperatures are high. Channelization is a possible factor in the distribution of the shadow bass in Mississippi River systems, but no difference in the distribution of shadow bass was found. Ecology The shadow bass is a freshwater fish that inhabits a climate range of 38 to 29°N in the United States. It prefers slow-flowing water over substrates of silt-free mud, sand, gravel, and pebbles. Brushy and vegetated pools are preferred microhabitat in most streams. Undercut banks and woody debris in small to medium-sized rivers and streams are also preferred habitat. The quantitative diet of shadow bass consists mostly of small invertebrates, mainly crayfish when less than three inches; after three inches, they can begin feeding on small fish species such as darters, madtoms, and minnows. The main predator and competitor of the shadow bass is the smallmouth bass which inhabits the same microhabitat. Research on the introduction of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in shadow bass habitat to measure competition between the species, the data showed no effect on shadow bass populations. Factors by humans that might attribute to population decline of the shadow bass channelization, sedimentation from logging, and habitat encroachment. Life history Shadow bass normally spawn from January to August, spawning season being determined by water temperature and so by location to somne extent too. Spawning is earlier in southern Alabama or southern Georgia as the wate is warmer in these regions, while fish found at higher latitudes typically spawn later when the water reached the ideal spawning temperature of .The breeding males show obvious darkening to the membranes of the pelvic and anal fins while these remain yellow or white in the females. Sexual maturity is attained at a year old and a mature female may lay 1,33 eggs in a spawning season, although after cold winters fewer, larger eggs are laid and this means that spawn hatching rates are not affected by temperature. This strategy of laying a smaller number of larger eggs after colder winters or a larger number of smaller eggs after milder winters ensures that the population of shadow bass has a consistent recruitment rate. Taxonomy and etymology The shadow bass is a member of the centrarchids or sunfish family and is closely related to the rock bass Ambloplites rupestris along with one more related species occurring naturally. The shadow bass was previously considered to be a subspecies of the rock bass (A. rupestris). It was first formally described in 1936 by Peter Viosca Jr. with the type locality given as Little Bogue Falaya Creek, 3 miles north of Covington, Louisiana. The generic name is derived from Greek and is a compound of ambloo meaning \\"blunt\\" and oplites meaning \\"shield\\", while the specific name means \\"large-eyed\\". Relationship with humans = Management = Through its range even for the two isolated populations, the shadow bass is not listed as being in any danger, and the shadow bass is federally listed as G5 secure, while the IUCN classify its status as Least Concern. Current management for the shadow bass in the rivers in Mississippi was to protects pools and prevent sediment pollution in areas of shadow bass populations. In most places, shadow bass are not considered a game fish and receive little management attention. In Missouri, however, where shadow bass has a demand in the game fish market, biologists are conducting population studies using mark and recapture methods and information for anglers to provide data to determine what, if any, angling restrictions need to apply to shadow bass fishing. = Angling = The IGFA all tackle world record for the shadow bass stands at 0.82kg (1lb 13oz) caught from the Spring River in Arkansas.

Modern obelisms are used by editors when proofreading a manuscript or typescript. Examples are \\"stet\\" (which is Latin for \\"Let it stand,\\" used in this context to mean \\"disregard the previous mark\\") and \\"dele\\" (for \\"Delete\\"). The obelos symbol (see obelus) gets its name from the spit, or sharp end of a lance in ancient Greek. An obelos was placed by editors on the margins of manuscripts, especially in Homer, to indicate lines that may not have been written by Homer. The system was developed by Aristarchus and notably used later by Origen in his Hexapla. Origen marked spurious words between obelos and metobelos. There were many other such shorthand symbols, to indicate corrections, emendations, deletions, additions, and so on. Most used are the editorial coronis, the paragraphos, the forked paragraphos, the reversed forked paragraphos, the hypodiastole, the downwards ancora, the upwards ancora, and the dotted right-pointing angle, which is also known as the diple periestigmene. Loosely, all these symbols, and the act of annotation by means of them, are obelism.

It involves the gifting or exchange of Pepero snacks, a line of chocolate-dipped cookie sticks, with the intention of displaying affection for friends and loved ones. It is held on this day due to the resemblance of Pepero sticks, which are vertical that mirror the shortened date of 11/11. History The exact origins of this day are unknown. The origins are usually traced to a news story set in 1983. In the story, two female middle school students in the Yeongnam region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin. However, there is some doubt about this story. Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1’s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks, while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin. The fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm at 11 seconds exactly. From 1997, Lotte started to use the aforementioned school story to successfully promote Pepero Day. The trend led to other companies creating similarly shaped snacks to participate on Pepero Day. , Lotte was making 50% of its annual sales on Pepero Day. , several department stores including Hyundai Department Store, Shinsegae, and Lotte Department Store were benefiting for people celebrating the day while stores such as E-mart and Homeplus were specially displaying and selling peperos on the day. Controversy Pepero Day has been criticized for being a business tool of certain companies and for having high calories which is contradictory to its original meaning.

He was also a noted historian and prolific writer. His episcopal mission was to reform the diocesan priests to ensure their holiness and to invigorate the faithful and cultivate greater participation in ecclesial affairs on their part. The process for his canonization proved quite slow despite initial momentum to see him proclaimed as a saint. The cause languished for several centuries until 1764 when Pope Clement XIII beatified him. Life Kadłubek was born in 1150 in Karwów near Opatów as the second of three children to the nobleman Stefan. His two brothers (in order; he was the middle child) were Stefan and Boguslav. Kadłubek first studied in Stopnica before he studied at the cathedral school in Kraków. It was while at the latter that he studied under Mateusz Cholewa. It was his patronage that saw Kadłubek sent abroad for further studies. He studied in France at the college in Paris as well as at the college in Bologna. Some sources suggest that he met the future Pope Innocent III at Bologna when the two were students and it was further said he once encountered John of Salisbury. He completed his studies in 1185 and returned home where he was ordained to the priesthood before 1189 and served as the provost for the Sandomierz Cathedral; some sources suggest that he served as he principal of the cathedral school in Kraków. In 1194 he moved to Sandomierz but returned to Kraków in 1207. It was after the death of Fulko - the Bishop of Kraków - that he was chosen to succeed him as the new bishop. Pope Innocent III confirmed the decision in a papal bull on 28 March 1208 and Kadłubek received his episcopal consecration from the Archbishop of Gniezno two months later. Innocent III's bull referred to Kadłubek's wisdom as the motivation for his selection while referring to him as a \\"master and preacher\\". He set out reforming the diocesan priesthood to ensure their holiness while also seeking to invigorate the faithful to active participation in ecclesial affairs. He also supported the construction of monasteries in the diocese. He also consecrated Saint Florian's Basilica and was said to have once been the chaplain to Casimir II the Just. Kadłubek ordained as a priest the Dominican friar Ceslaus. The bishop was noted for his linguistic skills and for his charismatic preaching; Kadłubek was known also for his expertise in canon law and for his approach to philosophical subjects as well as for his expertise in rhetoric. He knew of the natural sciences well since he had learnt them while in Paris and Bologna. But it was while in Europe that he started reading into the life and works of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and became enthralled with the charism of the Cistercians whom he granted favors to as bishop. He followed Gallus in further developing the idea of the Latin proverb \\"vox populi vox dei\\" (\\"the voice of the people is the voice of God\\") and argued that the ruler (king) should follow a council that includes bishops and representatives of clans since not the ruler but the council has higher power originating from the laws that God instituted. He also claimed that the council should elect the ruler and that rulers abusing their power should be removed from their position. In 1215 he participated in the Fourth Council of the Lateran. In 1218 he resigned from his diocese (after Pope Honorius III accepted it) and entered the convent in Jędrzejów. He became the first Pole to join the Cistercians. He had sent his resignation letter to the pope either in summer or autumn 1217 and spent that summer in Paris. Kadłubek died on 8 March 1223 and his remains were buried before the high altar of the convent church. His remains were exhumed on 26 April 1633 with his pallium found intact though his remains had become skeletal. Measurements were taken and it was surmised that he was of \\"fair height\\". His remains were moved to a new location before the high altar on the following 16 August. Kadłubek's remains were again exhumed and reinterred in mid-1765 and some were moved to Sandomierz in 1845 for veneration. Other parts to his remains were moved in 1903 to Wawel and placed in a silver urn. Beatification Painting in the Sandomierz Cathedral. In 1634 the Polish episcopate made a petition to Pope Urban VIII requesting his canonization. In 1650 the Bishop of Kraków Piotr Gembicki appointed a tribunal to hear witnesses for the cause but the commission never began its work which suspended the cause. Bishop Jan Małachowski - in 1683 - petitioned Pope Innocent XI to canonize the late bishop. Innocent XI requested the Congregation for Rites to begin an investigation which took place from 1688 to 1692. But the congregation concluded that there was no reliable evidence to prove his heroic virtue which suspended the cause once again. In 1682 the king Jan III Sobieski petitioned for his beatification. The Order of Cîteaux made similar request in 1699 at their General Chapter. The Polish episcopate made another request to Pope Clement XII to canonize him but the process that the pope requested came to the same conclusion as the previous one. In 1761 the king Augustus III sent two letters to Pope Clement XIII requesting the canonization which prompted the pope to order another process of investigation. That investigation proved to be successful for Clement XIII issued a papal bull in which he beatified the late bishop on 18 February 1764. On 9 June 1764 the pope issued another bull that allowed for a Mass and the Divine Office to be said in his honor in Kraków and among the Cistercians. He is referred to in Poland as a saint despite the fact that he has not been canonized as such; Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz referred to Kadłubek as a \\"saint\\" in 2008. Since 2 January 2016 he has been the patron for Jędrzejów. =Efforts to resume the cause= There had been several efforts since his beatification to resume the cause and achieve his canonization though each attempt failed. Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński and Karol Józef Wojtyła (the future Pope John Paul II) both supported his cause in 1964 with Wojtyła referring to the late bishop as the \\"Father of Polish culture\\". In 1972 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints concluded that there was no reliable or available documentation that could confirm Kadłubek's heroic virtues thus suspending the cause which has not continued since. Works Relics in Jędrzejów. His best-known work - Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae (Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland) - is a historical compendium of Poland in four volumes. The first three volumes take the form of a dialogue between Archbishop John of Gniezno and Bishop Mateusz. The first volume's sources are legends while the second is based on the chronicle of Gallus and the last two are based upon Kadłubek's own experiences. This work had a huge impact on the Polish political doctrine of the 14th and 15th centuries as luminaries such as Stanisław of Skarbimierz created as well as on later works of Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki. These ideas led to the Nobles' Democracy in Poland for it is in his works that for the first time the terms res publica (see Commonwealth and Rzeczpospolita) were used in the context of Poland. Some suggest that the book was written at the request of Prince Casimir II; others suggest that it was made at the request of Prince Leszek while Kadłubek was a bishop; still others claim that it was not written until after his retirement.

They joined in the upper Platte River Valley in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Wyoming. The fort was founded as a private trading post in the 1830s to service the overland fur trade; in 1849, it was purchased by the United States Army. It was located east of the long climb leading to the best and lowest crossing point of the Rocky Mountains at South Pass and became a popular stopping point for migrants on the Oregon Trail. Along with Bent's Fort on the Arkansas River, the trading post and its supporting industries and businesses were the most significant economic hub of commerce in the region. Fort William was founded by William Sublette and his partner Robert Campbell in 1834. In the spring of 1835, Sublette sold the fort to Thomas Fitzpatrick, a local fur trader. After the Rendezvous of 1836, it was sold to the American Fur Company, which still had a virtual monopoly on the western fur trade. Starting as early as the fall of 1840, the American Fur Company began competing with the newly established Fort Platte, built by L.P. Lupton. The American Fur Company hired workers from Santa Fe to construct an adobe fort to replace Fort William. This fort was named Fort John, after John Sarpy, a partner in the company. In 1849, United States Army purchased the fort as a post to protect the many wagon trains of migrant travelers on the Oregon Trail, and the subsidiary northern emigrant trails which split off further west. These included the California and Mormon trails. The middle reaches of the Mormon trail stayed on the north banks of the Platte and North Platte rivers, and merged with the other emigrant trails heading west over the continental divide from Fort John-Laramie. The name Fort Laramie came into gradual use, likely as a convenient shortening of \\"Fort John at the Laramie River\\". The remaining structures are preserved as the Fort Laramie National Historic Site by the National Park Service. History =Name= Interior of the original Fort Laramie as it looked prior to 1840. Painting from memory by Alfred Jacob Miller. In 1815 or 1816, Jacques La Ramee and a small group of fellow trappers settled in the area where Fort Laramie would later be located. He went out alone to trap in 1819 or 1820 and was never seen again. Arapahoe Indians were accused of killing La Ramee and burying his body in a beaver dam. The river was named \\"Laramie\\" in his honor, and later settlers used this name for the Laramie Mountains, the fort, and the towns of Laramie, Wyoming and Fort Laramie, Wyoming.L. G.

Painting from memory by Alfred Jacob Miller The original fort was constructed in the 1830s, probably in 1833–1834 by William Sublette. The overland fur trade was still prosperous. The fort was located near the confluence of two rivers, so it commanded a broad plain with water on two sides; these formed a partial natural moat. In addition, the nearby confluence of the North Platte's waters had a ford easily used by travelers on what later became the northern overland emigrant trails following the North Platte River west from Nebraska. With the opening of the Mormon Trail on the north bank of the Platte and North Platte, the fort was a junction for westbound travelers. It was an anchor roughly a quarter of the way to either California or Oregon on the famous Oregon Trail. To the west, the common trail leaving Fort John-Laramie later spins off to the Mormon and California trails further west along the road to the Rogue River Valley. The main trail passed northwest to Oregon's Willamette Valley and Oregon City. One of the early principal owner-trappers was William Sublette, and the fort was called Fort WilliamGriske, op. cit., p. 55 before being sold to the American Fur Company in 1841. (John Jacob Astor, the founder, had left his company a decade before.) The name was changed to Fort John after John B. Sarpy, a partner in the company. The 1846 treaties established relatively stable western territories after viable routes west had become well published. By the time the westward migration along the Oregon Trail had markedly increased, the U.S. Army had become tenants in the fort as well. The fort was located along the Laramie River just south of its mouth onto the North Platte River. On the opposite bank, the town of Fort Laramie, developed. (Both were later renamed to match the river's eponym.) Fort John (Fort Laramie) was originally built of logs in 1834, then rebuilt in adobe in 1841. This digital reconstruction from a National Park Service/CyArk project is based on archaeological data, descriptions, and illustrations from the period when the Fort still stood. It shows the south and east facades of the high-walled Fort John. As a private trading post it was fortified chiefly to prevent theft of the valuable furs. The name Fort John fell into disuse following the military takeover of the Fort in 1849, and disappeared from records by 1860. Geographically the site is situated just east of the steeper foothills terrain to the west (sometimes called \\"High Plains\\") that ascends to the east side of the Rocky Mountains proper. This ascent was among the few roadways accessible by the wagons pioneers used to the west. It passed through the Continental divide and reached the west slopes of the Rockies along a network of river valleys connecting to the far west via South Pass near the head waters of the North Platte. The strategic site on the eastern plains also had large grazing areas, where migrants could rest their draft animals before tackling the mountains. People could set up camps, do laundry, and heal before beginning anew the rigors of the westward trail. In 1845 the nearby Fort Bernard was established about east, farther down the North Platte River, in hopes of getting some of the growing Emigrant Trail trade with western bound wagon trains. This much smaller fort undersold the Laramie operation. It offered a connection south via a crude mule-train road to the Santa Fe Trail via Colorado. Fort Bernard burnt down in 1866, and was never rebuilt. Only a few years later the transcontinental railway joined the two American sea coasts and train travel largely replaced the overland travel along the Emigrant Trails. =Frontier army post= Fort Laramie, 1858. By Samuel C. Mills. This year, gold was discovered at Cherry Creek near Denver, prompting the Colorado gold rush. Even at a distance of more than 200 miles (320 km) from Denver, Fort Laramie became one of these miners' major connections to the world back east. The fort was purchased from Bruce Husband, a member of the American Fur Company, for $4,000 in June 1849 by U.S. Army Lt. Daniel P. Woodbury on behalf of the United States Government. Three companies of cavalry arrived at the fort that same month, and Company 'G', 6th Infantry, which was the post's permanent garrison for many years, arrived on August 12, 1849. By 1849 gold seekers had joined the Oregon-bound settlers and Mormons heading to Utah, and westward travelers were estimated to number between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1849. The fort itself occupied a location where the westward trail diverged in the direction of either Oregon, Salt Lake City or California. Based on contemporary accounts travelers would remain at the fort several days to mail letters, exchange or purchase cattle, replenish their provisions and reset wagon tires. The fort was taken over by the Army largely to protect and supply emigrants along the emigrant trails. In 1851, the first Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed, resulting in relatively peaceful relations between the whites and the Native Americans during the 1850s, though troops from the fort made up the small force that was killed during the Grattan massacre of 1854 under the command of Second Lieutenant John Lawrence Grattan. During the increasing strife of the 1860s, the fort took on a more military posture. Fort Laramie was never seriously threatened by Indian attacks during the quarter-century of intermittent warfare sparked by the Grattan massacre. However, a number of civilians were killed in the immediate area and their property destroyed or stolen during this period of hostilities on the plains. The last known death occurred in March 1877 on the Big Bitter Cottonwood Creek.Griske, op. cit., pp. 55, 63 The earliest surviving photograph of Fort Laramie, taken in 1858 by Samuel C. Mills, shows the remains of the old adobe walled fur trade fort (Fort John) flanked by a cluster of scattered wood and adobe buildings around the parade grounds. =Civil War, 1861–1865= With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the troops at Fort Laramie were withdrawn to fight the Confederate States Army in the east. To take their place, a series of volunteer regiments soon arrived at Fort Laramie, including the 11th Ohio Cavalry, serving until they were mustered out in 1866. Between October 1864 and October 1866 at least two companies from various units of \\"Galvanized Yankees\\" (Confederate prisoners of war recruited in the Union Army) were stationed at Fort Laramie. =Bozeman War, 1866–1868= On Christmas night in 1866, John \\"Portuguese\\" Phillips ended his historic horseback ride at Fort Laramie after riding from the Powder River Country. His entire unit had been killed in a fight with the Sioux under Red Cloud, and he had ridden to get reinforcements for Fort Phil Kearny. Legend maintains that Phillips' thoroughbred horse dropped dead upon arriving at the fort; it is unclear whether Phillips kept the same mount for the entire ride. Phillips crossed hostile Indian country, and had to make most of the journey during a brutal Wyoming blizzard. In the late 1860s, the fort was the primary staging ground for the United States in the Powder River Country during Red Cloud's War. In 1868 the parties reached a peace agreement codified as the second Treaty of Fort Laramie. =Great Sioux War of 1876–1877= The discovery of gold in the Black Hills touched off another period of conflict with the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne, as the United States violated their previous promise to keep the hills limited to the Sioux. Miners invaded the territory, and US forces came into conflict during the Great Sioux War of 1876. Fort Laramie served as a major staging point for supplies and troops. =Final years= After the completion of the transcontinental railroad, the fort's importance gradually decreased. Fewer wagon trains journeyed west, and regional Amerindians had been largely subdued. The fort was decommissioned in 1890. The original abandonment order was issued in 1889, and four of the infantry companies stationed there at that time went to Fort Logan, near Denver, Colorado that fall. In March 1890, about 30 cavalry soldiers and civilian mechanics under the command of Lt. C. W. Taylor arrived at the fort and removed doors, windows, flooring, and any other material from the buildings that was thought to be of value to the government. The last soldiers left Fort Laramie on April 20, 1890. All but one of the structures were sold at auction to private citizens. The entire military reservation, which was nine miles long and six miles wide, was opened up to homesteaders for settlement on October 5, 1891.Griske, op. cit., pp. 56, 57 Historic district In a 1983 document, the National Park Service describes a 536-acre historic district within the larger national historic site containing all of the historic structures, buildings, ruins, and sites, as well as a separate area containing a bridge. The NPS identified 36 significant physical remains that provide the background for the events and the people associated with Fort Laramie. These included 13 standing buildings, 11 standing ruins, and several buildings where only the foundations remain.

It is at high tide and at low tide, making it the Republic of China's seventh-largest island. The island is administered as , a rural township of Taitung County and one of the county's two offshore areas (the other being Orchid Island). The island once served as a penal colony for political prisoners during Taiwan's period of martial law, although today it is primarily known as a tourist hotspot. Names The island was known as Sama- Sana,https://archive.org/details/zoologyofvoyageo00adam/page/n135 Samasana and as in the 19th and early 20th century, a transcription of its Amis name Sanasai. The name \\"Green Island\\" is a calque of the island's Chinese name, written in traditional characters and in simplified characters. It is also known as Lüdao' or from the pinyin romanization of the name's Mandarin pronunciation; as 'Lu Tao Lighthouse from its Wade-Giles romanization; and as from its Hokkien pronunciation. The name was adopted by the Republic of China on August 1, 1949, at the behest of Huang Shih-hung , the magistrate of Taitung. Before that, it was usually known as (or Huoshao), a calque of its original Chinese name Huǒshāo Dǎo History The island was originally inhabited by the aboriginal Amis people. In March 1864 the British brig Susan Douglas was swept off course and wrecked on the island. Her captain then sailed by junk from the island to Kaohsiung, and the Royal Navy gunboat HMS Bustard found and rescued the remainder of the survivors. In the early 1870s, William Campbell saw the island from aboard the Daphne, and wrote: On 11 December 1937 the Dollar Steamship Company luxury ocean liner ran aground in a typhoon on a reef at Zhongliao Bay. All 503 passengers and 330 crew survived and were safely brought ashore. Over the next few days the cargo liners SS President McKinley and SS President Pierce took the survivors off the island, helped by boats provided by the and an Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer. Dollar Lines sold President Hoovers wreck to a Japanese salvage company, which spent the next three years breaking her up in situ. In response to the wreck, members of the US public gave money through the American Red Cross for a lighthouse to be built near Zhongliao village. Lüdao or Lu Tao Lighthouse was designed by Japanese engineers, built by local islanders in 1938 and is high. A shipwreck of Dutch origin dating to the 19th century was found in June 2013. =Prisons= Green Island Prison Green Island first served as an isolated spot and place of exile for political prisoners during the martial law period of Taiwanese history under the Kuomintang, and especially in the White Terror. After their release, many of the prisoners jailed between the late 1940s and the late 1980s went on to establish the Democratic Progressive Party, most notably Shih Ming-teh. Cartoonist Bo Yang served his prison terms there. The place where most of the political prisoners (such as Shih Ming-teh) were held was \\"Green Island Lodge\\" (Lǜ Dǎo Shānzhuāng). \\"Oasis Village\\" was the main penal colony. The prison was later closed, and its interior is now open to the public. \\"Green Island Prison\\" (Lǜdǎo Jiānyù) is also on the island and has housed prisoners considered to be among Taiwan's most dangerous criminals and gangsters. However, this has changed in recent years. Geography The island is formed of volcanic tholeiite, andesite, and volcanic explosive fragments with an area of 15 km2. The volcano erupted from the Pliocene to Pleistocene eras. It is part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc Magma was formed from underthrusting oceanic crust under compression at a depth of about . The andesite rock contains some visible crystals of pyroxene or amphibole. The geochemistry of the rock shows it is enriched in potassium, strontium and rubidium and light rare earth elements. Chromium and nickel are depleted. =Fauna= The island is a habitat for Formosan sika deer, Reeves's muntjacs, Ryukyu flying foxes, and resident and migratory birds. Local population Oasis Village In 1995 fewer than half of the registered 2,634 residents of the island actually lived on the island. The population is dwindling due to the difficulty of finding jobs on the island. The island has two pre-schools, one kindergarten, two elementary schools and one middle school. To pursue any education at the senior high school level or above, islanders must move to the main island of Taiwan. Public service centres include one seniors' home, one library, and one community centre. The villages and the settlements (聚落) they administer are: * Zhongliao Village (中寮村) ** Zhongliao * Nanliao Village (南寮村) ** Nanliao (南寮) ** Yugang (漁港) * Gongguan Village (公館村) ** Gongguan (公館) ** Chaikou (柴口) ** Liumagou (流麻溝) ** Dahu (大湖) ** Zuoping (左坪) The following abandoned aboriginal tribal settlements also belong to Gongguan Village: * Youzihu (柚子湖) * Nanzihu (楠子湖) * Haishenping (海參坪) * Dabaisha (大白沙) Power generation The island is powered by its only diesel-fired power plant with a capacity of 29.1 MW, consisting of 28 units of generation.

It is a Grade I listed building, classing it as a 'building of exceptional interest.' Construction It was constructed for Sir Thomas Tresham, the fervent Roman Catholic of Rushton Hall, and is thought to have been designed by Robert Stickells. The exact date is unknown but can be estimated to circa 1604-05, the year of Tresham's death. The New Bield was on the estate of Tresham's second home, Lyveden Manor House, also known as Lyveden Old Bield. Just as at Tresham's smaller folly Rushton Triangular Lodge, his principal estate, the New Bield has a religious design full of symbolism. Designed on a plan reminiscent of a Greek cross, the facades have a strict symmetry. The building has two floors above a raised basement, with mullioned and transomed windows. Each floor had three rooms with a staircase in the south projection of the cross. The exterior of the building is decorated by friezes of a religious nature. The metopes contain the emblems and motifs found also at the triangular lodge, such as the \\"IHS\\" christogram. Purpose The house was obviously meant for occupation, as it has a great hall and parlour on the first floor, kitchen and buttery in the basement, and a bedroom on the upper floor. However, it was probably never intended for full-time occupation. Too close to the main house for use as a hunting lodge, it may have been intended for use as a \\"Secret House\\"—keeping a secret house was a custom of the 16th century. Often within a mile of the main house, the secret house was a place where the head of the household would retire for a few days with a minimum of servants, while the principal house was thoroughly cleaned and, bearing in mind the sanitation of the time, fumigated. Similar examples of \\"secret houses\\" exist at Leconfield and Warkworth, where their use for this purpose has been well documented. Lyveden New Bield was never completed. It remains as it was when the builders left following Sir Thomas Tresham's death. Today, it is in the care of the National Trust. Lyveden Old Bield Lyveden Manor House, now also known as Lyveden Old Bield, the once grand principal house of the estate, had belonged to the Tresham family from c.1450. Today, little remains and what does was probably built by Thomas Tresham's grandson Lewis. The gatehouse has been removed to Fermyn Woods Hall, and the staircase was transported to America, where it was incorporated in the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House near Detroit. One wing remains with mullioned windows. In 2013, the National Trust acquired Lyveden Manor House. It is open to the public. The National Trust's long-term aim is to restore the historic gardens and open them to the public.  Gardens  Tresham designed extensive gardens between the manor house and the New Bield, but for centuries little evidence of the gardens remained. In 2010, National Trust experts studying photographs taken by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War discovered the remains of an Elizabethan labyrinth, garden and orchard in the grounds. The gardens were subsequently upgraded to a Grade I listing by English Heritage. The National Trust has reconstructed Tresham's orchard, and restored the moat on three sides of the labyrinth. The Tresham Family and The Gunpowder Plot Sir Thomas Tresham died in 1605 following decades of religious persecution, his once vast wealth having been severely depleted. His son Francis Tresham inherited the estate, but within the same year, along with his cousins Catesby and Wintour, he became involved in the Gunpowder Plot. Thus, within a year the estate had a third owner, Francis's son Lewis Tresham. The estate was managed by Lewis's mother until her death in 1615. After this, Lewis Tresham, a spendthrift, lost the remaining family wealth. The estate was eventually sold following the death of his son in 1643.

She has generally been associated with the Serpent Society, often as foes of Captain America. Sitznski was given her superhuman abilities by the Roxxon corporation, giving her the codename Anaconda due to her powerful, adamantium-enhanced arms she uses to constrain or crush her opponents with. Her first appearance was as part of the Serpent Squad where they tried to retrieve the Serpent Crown only to be thwarted by Thing, Stingray and Triton. She later became a core member of Sidewinder's Serpent Squad and remained a member when they became the Serpent Society. Publication history Anaconda was created by Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio and first appeared in Marvel Two-in-One #64 in June 1980. Fictional character biography =Origin= Blanche \\"Blondie\\" Sitznski was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She worked as a steelworker until executives at the Roxxon Oil Company selected her to become a special agent in covert operations. She was already well-adjusted to villainy, as she was the calisthenics instructor at the criminal trainer Taskmaster's Academy. It was there that she trained several women in hand-to-hand combat, most notably Diamondback and Snapdragon. She was eventually taken to Roxxon's Mutagenic Laboratory and bioengineered by Roxxon's Mutagenics Division to have various permanent serpentine features. Her entire skeletal structure was laced with an artificial adamantium, giving her the ability to elongate her arms and legs, which she uses to constrict her enemies. She had also been surgically given gills, which allows her to breathe underwater. She has tiny scales on her face, neck, chest, and back, and small fins on her lower cheeks. Though Anaconda's trade characteristic is her blonde hair, she is actually a natural brunette.Captain America #403. Marvel Comics. Anaconda loves to listen to show tunes, and is particularly fond of Thoroughly Modern Millie.Cable & Deadpool #33-34. Marvel Comics. Anaconda squeezes the life out of the Thing. =Serpent Squad= Her first mission as part of the second Serpent Squad grouped her with three other snake-themed villains: Sidewinder, Black Mamba, and Death Adder. They were given the task to retrieve the Serpent Crown for the Roxxon company president, Hugh Jones. During the mission, the group came into conflict with the Fantastic Four's Thing, Stingray and the Inhuman Triton. Anaconda eagerly battled the Thing, and was able to apprehend him with ease. They found the Serpent Crown, but the Thing and Triton retaliated, defeating Anaconda, Black Mamba and Death Adder by trapping them underwater.Marvel Two- in-One #65. Marvel Comics. Anaconda freed herself and her teammates from their underwater captivity using her brute strength, and they were sent on another mission—this time, to search for a powerful weapon known as the Micro-Scanner. After battling Iron Man, Anaconda and the others were defeated and presumably taken to prison.Iron Man #160. Marvel Comics. =Serpent Society= The trio somehow escaped, and sought out Sidewinder for payment from their first mission together. He gave them their share of the money, plus more, inviting them to join his new criminal organization, the Serpent Society.Captain America #308. Marvel Comics. Anaconda hesitantly accepted the offer. At the orientation, Sidewinder grouped Anaconda together with Cobra and the Rattler to perform an initiation test. Their job was to steal equipment from the bankrupt Brand Corporation. Constrictor, annoyed with the whole idea of the Serpent Society, spied on Anaconda's group and called the Avengers hotline to tip them off. Captain America showed up just as Anaconda and the others were pulling their heist, and Anaconda ordered Cobra and Rattler to return to Sidewinder with the apparatus. During an intense battle with the Avenger, Anaconda was able to wrap her arms around Captain America. She started to crush his bones, but one well-placed hit of his shield knocked her out, and she was taken to jail.Captain America #310. Marvel Comics. Teleported out by Sidewinder, Anaconda paid a visit to Constrictor, beating him to near death. Anaconda also participated in the mission to murder M.O.D.O.K., but was knocked out with a mind-blast early in the fight. However, her teammates Cottonmouth and Death Adder were able to kill him, and Anaconda carried his corpse to A.I.M. for the large sum profit they were promised.Captain America #315. Marvel Comics. Soon after, Anaconda's best friend, Death Adder, was murdered by the Scourge of the Underworld. She vowed to find the murderer and avenge his death.Captain America #319. Marvel Comics. When Viper invaded the Serpent Society, Anaconda willingly switched sides and attacked Diamondback when she brought Captain America and D-Man to help, but was defeated by Diamondback's acid-tipped diamonds.Captain America #342.

Powers and abilities Anaconda constricts her arms around Cable. Anaconda has the superhuman ability to elongate her limbs and constrict her opponents. Her arms and legs are able to elongate to about one and a half times their normal length (though most artists show her greatly exceeding that length), while her muscles engorge with blood, giving the appearance of massive, snake-like limbs. Once she has entwined her limbs around a human-sized foe, there are very few human beings able to break free of her grip. She has also been surgically given gills, which allow her to breathe underwater, and modified lungs for extracting oxygen from water. Due to all the bio-engineering performed on her, Anaconda has incredible recuperative abilities and she is able to heal non-fatal wounds several times faster than a normal human being. Her strength is enhanced beyond normal human levels and she is an excellent swimmer. Her entire skeletal structure is laced with an adamantium alloy-based substance, increasing her durability. Anaconda is a skilled combatant, using street-fighting techniques to accommodate her elongating arms.

The rocks are deformed in a number of different ways: by erosion and weathering, glacial action, or from a sudden disturbance. Mushroom rocks are related to, but different from, yardang.The Facts on File. Earth Science Handbook A mushroom rock, rock pedestal, or gour is a typical mushroom-shaped landform that is formed by the action of wind erosion. At an average height of from the base, the material-carrying capacity of the wind is at its maximum, so abrasion (erosion by wind in which transported materials hit an exposed rock surface and polish it or scratch it) is also maximized. In some cases, harder rocks are arranged horizontally over a softer rock, resulting in such erosion. Erosion Usually found in desert areas, these rocks form over thousands of years when wind erosion of an isolated rocky outcrop progresses at a different rate at its bottom than at its top. Abrasion by wind-borne grains of sand is most prevalent within the first above the ground, causing the bases of outcrops to erode more rapidly than their tops. Running water can have the same effect. An example of this type of mushroom rock is the one in Timna Park, Israel. Occasionally, the chemical composition of the rocks can be an important factor; if the upper part of the rock is more resistant to chemical erosion and weathering, it erodes more slowly than the base. For example, erosion attributed to chemical weathering at the base of the rock due to the collection of dew near the surface. A mushroom rock may ultimately form from an originally flat area of hard rock overlying soft rock, similar to the pattern of rocks that form a waterfall. Weathering of the exposed hard rock layer eventually exposes the lower rock to erosion from wind, water, salt intrusion, etc., depending on local conditions. The layer of softer rock is more readily eroded, leading to the formation of a depression or blowout. The overlying harder rocks are resistant to this process, and may ultimately end up as isolated mushroom rocks standing above the new, lower plain. The nature of wind erosion is that it concentrates a few feet over the ground - wind speeds increase with height, but sediment load reduces. This means that the combination of highest sediment loads and fastest wind speed exist a few feet over the ground, leading to the characteristic narrowing of the support pedestal at this height. Glacial action In contrast to a mushroom rock formed by erosion of a single rock, these mushrooms are a type of balancing rock that formed from two separate rocks, one of which came to rest on top of the other. Typically, the uppermost rock was transported and deposited by the slow action of a glacier. The lower part of the rock formation might or might not have also undergone a degree of erosion to accentuate the mushroom shape. Examples of this type of rock are Mushroom Rock in Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, Tennessee,Mushroom Rock and Le Champignon in Huelgoat, France.Le Champignon Rock disturbance This type of mushroom rock forms from two rocks, one of which came to rest on the top of the other, caused by a very sudden disturbance such as a rock fall or earthquakes. It is formed by erosion and weathering. It is a typical mushroom shaped land form that is found in places like deserts.

It has mainly black plumage, a blue eye-ring, and a broadly white or rufous-tipped tail. The male and female have different head and bill patterns. Males have bright yellow feathers on the auriculars, cheeks, throat, neck-sides and chest, but these areas are black in the female, except for the blue throat. The bill of the male is yellow with a red base and casque, and a brownish basal half of the lower mandible. The bill and casque of the female is almost entirely yellow. This is a forest species and eats mainly fruit, such as figs, although it will also eat small animals such as frogs and insects. Wrinkled hornbills do not drink, but get the water they need from their food. Their call is a harsh \\"Kak-kak,\\" or a deep \\"Row- wow\\" which can be heard for miles. These birds are monogamous and remain in a pair for life. They use holes found in trees for nests, and the female will plaster over the entrance with mud and droppings, leaving a nesting mother and her chicks only a small hole, too small for them to exit. They are fed exclusively by the male, who regurgitates food for them. After several months, when the chicks are ready, the female will break out of her nest. Wrinkled hornbills were first bred in captivity in 1988. Heavy deforestation in their forest habitat has led them to be uplisted from near threatened to endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2018.

The company is now headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, and currently provides services for automated equipment in enterprise-level companies. History According to its charter, the Bell & Howell Company was incorporated on February 17, 1907. It was duly recorded in the Cook County Record Book eight days later. The first meeting of stockholders took place in the office of Attorney W. G. Strong on February 19 at 10 a.m. The first board of directors was chosen for a term of one year: Donald Joseph Bell (1869–1934), chairman; Albert Summers Howell (1879–1951), secretary; and Marguerite V. Bell (wife of Donald Bell), vice chairman. Historically, Bell & Howell Co. was an important supplier of many different media technologies. The firm built its name making such products as: * A rotary framer on 35mm film projectors in 1907 * A 35mm film perforator in 1908 * Professional 35mm motion-picture film cameras from 1909 on * Printing equipment used by motion-picture film laboratories since 1911 * The Standard Cinematograph Type 2709 hand-cranked camera (used in early silent films, it was so expensive that only Charlie Chaplin and three other people owned one. The rest were owned by studios) *Newsreel and amateur film cameras such as the Filmo (end of 1923) and Eyemo (1925), and Autoload EE (1956) * Military 16mm film gun camera TYPE N-6A * Regular-8 and Super-8 film cameras and projectors (all models) * 16mm silent and sound projectors (all models); the famous Filmosound projectors dominated the market for many years. *Slide projectors (2\\" × 2\\") * 35 mm filmstrip projectors. * Overhead presentation projectors (all models) * Stereo cameras and stereo slide projectors through its TDC subsidiary In 1934, Bell & Howell introduced their first amateur 8mm movie projector, in 1935 the Filmo Straight Eight camera, and in 1936 the Double-Run Filmo 8. The 1938 Kodak cassette holding 25 feet of Double-Eight film was taken by the Filmo Auto-8 in 1940. The firm added microfilm products in 1946. In 1954, Bell & Howell purchased DeVry Industries' 16mm division. Although known for manufacturing their film projectors, a partnership with Canon between 1961 and 1976 offered still cameras. Many of their 35mm SLR cameras were manufactured by Canon with the Bell & Howell logo or Bell & Howell/Canon in place of the Canon branding. The firm dropped the production of movie cameras by the end of the 1970s. Bell & Howell was a supplier of media equipment for schools and offices. The film laboratory line is now a separate company, BHP Inc, which is a division of Research Technology International. It purchased University Microfilms International in the 1980s. UMI produced a product called ProQuest. They also had an Electronics and Instrumentation Division on Lennox Road, Basingstoke, UK. This facility produced several different types of transducers for applications such as North Sea oil platforms and the Ariane Space vehicles. In the 2000s, Bell & Howell decided to focus on their information technology businesses. The imaging business was sold to Eastman Kodak and the international mail business was sold to Pitney Bowes. On June 6, 2001, Bell & Howell became a ProQuest Company, which was then a publicly traded company, but is now a subsidiary of the private Cambridge Information Group. In September 2001, the remaining industrial businesses along with the Bell & Howell name were sold to private equity firm Glencoe Capital. The company merged with the North American arm of Böwe Systec Inc. In 2003, Böwe Systec later acquired the entire company. It was known as Böwe Bell & Howell until 2011, when Versa Capital Management bought the company out of bankruptcy and renamed the company \\"Bell and Howell, LLC\\".Judge OKs $80M Versa Bid For Bowe Bell & Howell In December 2018 Versa Capital Management, LLC (“Versa”) announced the successful closing of the sale of Bell and Howell, to Boston-based WestView Capital Partners (“WestView\\"). Apple II Bell & Howell marketed a specially designed Apple II Plus computer to the educational market beginning in July 1979. The modified Apple had additional security elements for classroom use such as a tamper-proof cover. The case color was black but the inside was a standard Apple II Plus. The modified Apple II became known colloquially among computer enthusiasts as the \\"Darth Vader\\" Apple II for its black case design.  Education Group  Bell & Howell founded an Education Group within the company in 1907. This Education Group created Bell & Howell Schools in 1966. In that same year, the Education Group purchased a controlling share of DeVry Institute of Technology. Two years later in 1968, Bell & Howell’s Education Group, via a controlling interest in DeVry, acquired Ohio Institute of Technology in Columbus, Ohio.Page six of the Ohio Institute of Technology Student hand book from the school year 1974-1975 Over the years, the Education Group has bought and sold large interests in a variety of educational organizations and institutions.

The population as of the 2016 census was 7,739. Fort Frances is a popular fishing destination. It hosts the annual Fort Frances Canadian Bass Championship. Located on the international border with the United States where Rainy Lake narrows to become Rainy River, it is connected to International Falls, Minnesota by the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge. The town is the fourth-largest community in Northwestern Ontario after Thunder Bay, Kenora and Dryden. The Fort Frances Paper Mill was formerly the main employer and industry in the town until its closure in January 2014. New Gold, a Canadian mining company, acquired mineral rights to the area in 2013. The Rainy River mine commenced processing ore on September 14, 2017 and completed its first gold pour on October 5, 2017.https://www.newgold.com/assets/rainy-river/default.aspx History Fort Frances courthouse Fort Frances was the first European settlement west of Lake Superior and was established by French Canadian Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, first commander of the western district. In 1731, he built Fort Saint Pierre near that spot as support for the fur trade with native peoples. In 1732, his expedition built Fort Saint Charles on Magnuson's Island on the west side of Lake of the Woods. After some time, Fort Saint Pierre fell out of use. In 1817, following the War of 1812 and the redefinition of borders between Canada and the United States, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) built a fort here. In 1830 HBC Chief Factor John Dugald CameronSylvia Van Kirk, \\"CAMERON, JOHN DUGALD,\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed November 22, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_dugald_8E.html. named the fur trading post after Frances Ramsay Simpson, the 18-year-old daughter of a London merchant,Sylvia Van Kirk, \\"SIMPSON, FRANCES RAMSAY,\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed November 22, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/simpson_frances_ramsay_8E.html. who had married earlier that year in London, George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, who would visit the fort many times. In 1841 she became Lady Simpson after George Simpson was knighted, and she died in 1853 at Lachine, Quebec.John S.

Incorporated in 1903, the town held a big centennial celebration in 2003. The main employer was a pulp and paper mill established in the early 1900s. It had numerous owners over the years, notably Edward Wellington Backus. Now owned by Resolute Forest Products, the mill employed about 700 persons until its closure in 2014. On June 25, 1946, the town was struck by a tornado, which caused major damage and struck a week after the deadly Windsor tornado. On August 25, 2013, the town hosted the final pitstop in the Kraft Celebration Tour by receiving the most votes out of all 20 communities On January 14, 2014, Resolute Forest Products announced that it planned to stop operations of the final paper machine and close out its operations in Fort Frances by the end of the month. On December 13, 2014, Tim Hortons filmed a commercial in Fort Frances. The commercial, which dubs Fort Frances \\"one of the coldest places in Canada\\", was shot at the local Tim Hortons. In the days leading up to the filming, yarn was seen covering trees, benches, etc. Workers had spent the night covering the interior of the restaurant with yarn and building a giant toque on the roof. For the day, the coffee was free.

The National Historic Site consists of two units, one located on the site of Fort Vancouver in modern-day Vancouver, Washington; the other being the former residence of John McLoughlin in Oregon City, Oregon. The two sites were separately given national historic designation in the 1940s. The Fort Vancouver unit was designated a National Historic Site in 1961, and was combined with the McLoughlin House into a unit in 2003. Visitor Center The visitor center at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site was originally built in 1966 as a part of the National Park Service's Mission 66 Program. Today, the visitor center is co-operated by the both the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service. Recent renovations to the visitor center (2015) transformed the historic building as an information center for both Fort Vancouver National Historic Site and the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The visitor center features rotating archaeological exhibits from the national historic site and art exhibits from local native artists. The building also has a theater that shows 2 films from the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service: Oregon Experience: Fort Vancouver (25mins), and Mount St. Helens - Eruption of Life (17mins). HBC Fort Vancouver site The main unit of the site, containing Fort Vancouver, is located in Vancouver, Washington, just north of Portland, Oregon. Fort Vancouver was an important Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) fur trading post that was established in 1824. Operations until 1845 were overseen by Chief Factor John McLoughlin. It was the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company's fur trade activity on the Pacific coast and its influence stretched from the Rocky mountains in the east, to Alaska in the north, Alta California in the south, and to the Kingdom of Hawaii in the Pacific. Ratified in 1846, the Treaty of Oregon was signed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, thereby ending the decades long Oregon boundary dispute. The treaty permitted the Hudson's Bay Company to continue to operate at Fort Vancouver, which was now within the Oregon Territory. On June 14, 1860, Fort Vancouver was abandoned by the Hudson's Bay Company in favor of their stations in British Columbia, such as Fort Victoria. In 1849, the United States Army constructed the Vancouver Barracks adjacent to the British trading post; and took over the facility when it was abandoned. A fire destroyed the Hudson's Bay Company fort in 1866, but the Army facility continued in operation in various forms until the present. Fort Vancouver was separated from the Army's barracks and became a national monument in 1948. Congress expanded the protected area in 1966 and re- designated the site as a National Historic Site. For some years after its addition to the National Park System, the National Park Service was reluctant to begin reconstruction of the fort walls or buildings, preferring to manage it as an archaeological site as provided by its standing policies. However, in 1965, with the urging of the local community, Congress directed reconstruction to begin. All fort structures seen today are modern replicas, albeit carefully placed on the original locations. . In response to concerns about the designation of reconstructed structures, the Park Service designated the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District to encompass reconstructed buildings as well as historic Army and Mission 66 era Park Service structures. The National Park Service also operates the Pearson Air Museum on the fort grounds. An earth-covered pedestrian land bridge was built over the Lewis and Clark Highway, as part of the Confluence Project, in 2007. It connects the site with the Columbia River. McLoughlin House site The McLoughlin House unit consists of the homes of McLoughlin, and of Dr. Forbes Barclay, an explorer and associate of McLoughlin's; the two homes are known respectively as the McLoughlin House and the Barclay House. They are located adjacent to each other on a bluff overlooking the Willamette River in Oregon City, Oregon, on a plot of land set aside for public use by McLoughlin in the 1840s. In 1846, McLoughlin left the employ of Hudson's Bay Company, and purchased from the company a land claim located on the Willamette River in Oregon City. McLoughlin constructed the house there, and lived there until his death in 1857. The house, a two-style colonial mansion, is typical of East Coast residences from the time. After McLoughlin's death in 1857, his widow lived there until she died three years later; their heirs sold the house in 1867. The home soon became a bordello known as the Phoenix Hotel. In 1908, the paper mill that owned the property wished to expand and the house was threatened with demolition, but preservationists saved it the next year, raising over $1,000 and overcoming a referendum. In 1910 the house was moved from the riverfront to its current location on a bluff overlooking downtown Oregon City. It sat there for twenty-five years, until being restored in 1935-1936 under the auspices of the Civil Works Administration, and opened as a museum. The Barclay House was built in 1849 by Portland carpenter and pioneer John L. Morrison, and occupied by Dr. Barclay and his family. Barclay died in 1874; the house remained in the family's possession until 1930 when it was moved from the waterfront to its present location, next to the McLoughlin House. Today, the Barclay House contains museum offices and a gift shop. The McLoughlin House became a National Historic Site in 1941, and both homes were added to the National Park System in 2003, becoming part of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.PL 108–63, July 29, 2003, 117 Stat. 872, accessed at The McLoughlin House unit lies on the Oregon National Historic Trail, a part of the National Trails System. The graves of McLoughlin and his wife are on the premises. The house contains both original and period furnishings. Pearson Air Museum Opened in a historic hangar in 1996, the Pearson Air Museum and The Jack Murdock Aviation Center showcases aviation history in the Vancouver area, and specifically Pearson Airfield. Today, the Pearson Air museum displays a number of aircraft, including a De Havilland DH-4 Liberty that has been restored to represent an aircraft from the US Army Air Corps 321st Observation Squadron that was stationed at Pearson Airfield in the 1930s. In June 2018, National Park Service Volunteers completed work on a replica of Silas Christofferson's Curtis Pusher from scratch. The original plane was flown from the roof of the Multnomah Hotel in Portland, OR to the location of the modern day Pearson airfield. The replica is currently being exhibited at the Pearson Air Museum. Exhibits at the museum also feature the US Army Spruce Production Division, and the first transpolar flight which landed in 1937 on Pearson Field from Moscow, Russia. Models of the Russian Tupolev ANT-25 that made the first transpolar flight are on display at the museum. Vancouver Barracks Parts of the Vancouver Barracks were transferred to the National Park Service in 2012 when the US Army Reserve officially closed the post after its continuous occupation since 1849. From the National Park Service Website: > \\"While many of the buildings are closed to the public, wayside exhibits > throughout the barracks share the history of this military post. \\" Since the Post to Park transfer to the National Park Service in 2012, the NPS has been restoring and renovating the barracks buildings to be used as mixed- use structures. Future tenants of these buildings are expected to be other governmental agencies, community groups, and private businesses. The area is expected to feature a community center, office buildings, restaurants, and retail in addition to a future museum space for the Vancouver Barracks operated by the National Park Service. In 2016, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest of the USDA National Forest Service moved its headquarters and administration operations to one of the renovated double infantry barracks buildings in the Vancouver Barracks. The United States Forest Service co- operates the visitor center on Fort Vancouver National Historic Site along with the National Park Service. Recreation A cross country running course is located at the site. The USA Cross Country Championships have been held at this site.

Publication history The Adversary first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #187-188 (November-December 1984), and was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr. Fictional character biography The Adversary is a demon who was initially summoned by the X-Men member Forge several decades ago and has since come back to antagonize the X-Men and threaten the entire world. During the Vietnam War, Forge saw his company slain by the North Vietnamese. Forge tapped into his long-suppressed shamanic heritage to summon the Adversary to destroy the attackers, but then regained his senses and banished the demon. Nevertheless, the Adversary had a foothold on the Earth thanks to Forge's actions. Years later, Forge's mentor Nazé was killed and his form and memories stolen by a Dire Wraith, an alien parasite. The Nazé impostor summoned the Adversary, only to be destroyed by the demon. The Adversary was then able to escape the dimension to which he was bound, capturing Forge and his ally, Storm of the X-Men, and imprisoning them in the otherworldly stronghold of the goddess Roma, whom he subdued. The Adversary then travelled to Dallas, Texas and battled the combined forces of the X-Men and Freedom Force during the \\"Fall of the Mutants\\" crossover. Ultimately, the only way to permanently banish the Adversary was for nine souls to willingly sacrifice themselves in a magical spell. The X-Men agreed, and Forge cast the spell. The X-Men died, but Roma secretly returned them to life.Uncanny X-Men #220-227 (August 1987-March 1988) The Adversary later returned to Earth, having been physically born, but was again banished by Forge, who was at the time affiliated with X-Factor.X-Factor #118-121 (January-April 1996) During the Fear Itself storyline, Adversary attends the Devil's Advocacy to talk about the Serpent's actions on Earth.Journey Into Mystery #627 The Adversary possesses Forge in Cable and X-Force - Volume 4, but is trapped in a mind prison inside Dr. Nemesis' subconsciousness.

Gabon is a country in west central Africa sharing borders with the Gulf of Guinea to the west, Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, and Cameroon to the north, with the Republic of the Congo curving around the east and south. Its size is almost 270,000 km² with an estimated population of 1,500,000. The capital and largest city is Libreville.  First posts  The earliest post office was set up at Libreville in 1862; mail from there was routed through the British post office on Fernando Po (now Bioko). Mail used the stamps of the French Colonies general issue, cancelled with a \\"GAB\\" inside a lozenge of dots.  First stamps  On 31 July 1886 Gabon issued its first stamps, which were surcharges on the existing stock, to cover shortages of the most-used values. The overprint consisted of \\"GAB\\" in dots, plus the new value. Additional surcharges in 1888 were just the numeral, while in 1889 the postage due stamps were overprinted \\"GABON / TIMBRE\\" in addition to the new value, to indicate their validity as regular stamps. Also in 1889 15c and 25c stamps were locally typeset; they were inscribed \\"Gabon-Congo / POSTES\\" in one corner, the value in the opposite corner, and a diagonal \\"Republique Française\\" across the middle. All of these early issues were produced in small numbers, and not often seen. Navigation & Commerce 10-centime value, cancelled at Libreville in 1910.  French colonial stamps  Fang warrior, 5c, 1910. This 1932 5-centime value, showing a timber raft on the Ogooué River, was in use for only a short time. From 1891 to 1904, Gabon was administered as part of the French Congo, but in connection with a grant of partial autonomy, it issued its own stamps in 1904. These were the stamps of the Navigation and Commerce Issue used by all the French colonies, and included 17 values ranging from 1c to 5fr.https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052652/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/gabon/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. This was followed in 1910 by a set using designs specific to Gabon; a Fang warrior, a view of Libreville, and a Fang woman, all printed in two colors. A first version included \\"CONGO FRANÇAIS\\" along with \\"GABON\\" in the inscription, but was soon supplanted by a redesign saying \\"AFRIQUE EQUATORIALE\\" instead. As with many other colonies, leftover stamps of the Navigation & Commerce issue were surcharged \\"5\\" and \\"10\\" in 1912. From 1924 on, the 1910-series stamps were overprinted \\"AFRIQUE EQUATORIALE FRANÇAISE\\", and from 1927 some of these were additionally surcharged with new values. A new definitive series came out in 1932, comprising 24 values using three designs; a timber raft on the Ogooué River, a portrait of de Brazza, and a view of the village of Setta Kemma. This series was only briefly in use, since Gabon was absorbed into French Equatorial Africa and used its stamps thereafter.  Independence  This cover, sent from Libreville to Chicago in 1965, uses stamps of both the 1961 flower issue and the 1962 M'ba issue. Although the Republic was proclaimed in November 1958, the people continued to use the stamps of French Equatorial Africa, and the first issue of the Republic came on its 1st anniversary, 28 November 1959, with two values depicting different views of Prime Minister Léon M'ba. During the 1960s, issues followed a pattern generally common to France and the former French colonies; multicolored engraved stamps in an oblong format, either horizontal or vertical. Some were conscious imitations of French designs, such as the small-format coat of arms stamps that began appearing in 1969 and continuing into the 1980s (long after France itself had stopped using the design). The 1970s saw the gradual appearance of stamps designed primarily to appeal to American and European collectors, such as an issue featuring motorcycles in 1978, and Nobel laureates in 1995, but these have been the exception rather than the rule. In 1965 Gabon issued one of the first gold foil stamps, one honoring Albert Schweitzer.  References   Further reading  Stone, Robert G. The diverse world of postal markings of Gabon/Congo/A.E.F.

The museum is built around the former Lorraine Motel, which was the site of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968; King died at St. Joseph's Hospital. Two other buildings and their adjacent property, also connected with the King assassination, have been acquired as part of the museum complex. The museum reopened in 2014 after renovations that increased the number of multi- media and interactive exhibits, including numerous short movies to enhance features. The museum is owned and operated by the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation, based in Memphis. The Lorraine Motel is owned by the Tennessee State Museum and leased long term to the Foundation to operate as part of the museum complex. In 2016, the museum was honored by becoming a Smithsonian Affiliate museum. History Wide-view image of the Lorraine Motel and the boarding house (to the left) from which James Earl Ray fired the fatal shot. Police say he fired from the second floor bathroom window (to the left of the lightpole). The site began as the 16-room Windsorlorrine Hotel around 1925 and was later known as the Marquette Hotel. In 1945, Walter Bailey purchased it and renamed it for his wife Loree and the song \\"Sweet Lorraine\\". During the segregation era, Bailey operated the motel as upscale lodging that catered to a black clientele. He added a second floor, a swimming pool, and drive-up access for more rooms on the south side of the complex. He changed the name from Lorraine Hotel to Lorraine Motel. Among its guests through the 1960s were musicians going to Stax Records, including Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, Aretha Franklin, Ethel Waters, Otis Redding, the Staple Singers and Wilson Pickett. Martin Luther King, Jr., was shot at approximately 6:01 p.m. on April 4, 1968, a day after delivering his famous \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\" speech. Following the assassination of King, Bailey withdrew Room 306 (where King died) and the adjoining room 307 from use, maintaining them as a memorial to the activist leader. Bailey's wife, Loree, suffered a stroke hours after the assassination and died five days later. Bailey reduced the operation by converting the other motel rooms to single room occupancy for low-income residential use. =Establishing the memorial foundation= Bailey worked with Chuck Scruggs, program director of WDIA, and attorney D'Army Bailey, to raise funds to \\"Save the Lorraine.\\" They worked with the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. The Foundation bought the motel for $144,000, following foreclosure in December 1982. In 1984, the group changed the name of their organization to the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation. The Lorraine finally closed as an SRO motel on March 2, 1988. Sheriff's deputies were needed to evict the last holdout tenant, Jacquoline Smith, in preparation for an $8.8 million overhaul. Walter Bailey, Lorraine Motel owner, died in July 1988, before getting to see the results of his efforts to establish the museum. The Foundation worked with Smithsonian Institution curator Benjamin Lawless to develop a design to save historical aspects of the site. The Nashville, Tennessee firm McKissack and McKissack was tapped to design a modern museum on those portions of the grounds that were not directly related to the assassination. =Museum opening in 1991= The museum was dedicated on July 4, 1991, and officially opened to the public on September 28, 1991. D'Army Bailey was the founding president of the museum. In 1999, the Foundation acquired the Young and Morrow Building, and its associated vacant lot on the West side of Mulberry, as part of the museum complex. A tunnel was built under the lot to connect the building with the motel. The Foundation became the custodian of the police and evidence files associated with the assassination, including the rifle and fatal bullet. The latter are on display in a 12,800 sq. foot exhibit in the former Y & M building, which opened September 28, 2002. =Renegotiation of lease with state in 2007= Through the years, there has been controversy over composition of the board of the museum Foundation and of the mission of the museum, as people have differing opinions. These issues came to a head in December 2007, as the museum foundation was asking the state, which owned the property, to extend its lease for 50 years rent-free. Bailey, a circuit court judge, said he was disappointed with the museum's emphasis on history. He said that he had envisioned it as an institution to inspire activism. By 2007, members of the board included whites from the corporate world. Bailey and other community activists criticized the board as \\"too white\\" and claimed they were shutting out the community. Beverly Robertson, then director of the museum, defended the board and the museum's operation. Gregory Duckett, a board member, disagreed with Bailey's interpretation, saying the museum was never designed as an activist institution. Robertson noted that many board members were African Americans who had been activists and also entered corporate life. In 2007, the state agreed to a 20-year lease, while taking over major maintenance of the complex. It required the museum board to hold annual public meetings and increase the number of African-American board members. =2012 renovations= Lorraine Motel, Memphis, Tennessee The main museum closed in November 2012 for a $27.5 million renovation, to include changes to exhibits and upgrades to building systems. The exhibits were updated for historical accuracy and to add to their evocative power; the work was guided by a group of recognized civil rights scholars. The building's renovations included replacement and repair of the HVAC and mechanical systems, expansion of the lobby, and creation of a new educational center. Many of the museum's most popular exhibits did not change, such as Room 306 (where Dr. King was staying when he died), the replica sanitation truck (Dr. King came to Memphis to support an AFSCME sanitation workers' strike), and the replica of the bus Rosa Parks rode in Montgomery, Alabama, before initiating the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56. The original bus resides at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. In the 2014 reopening, a major new exhibit featured is a replica of the U.S. Supreme Court room where oral argument was heard in 1954 in the seminal Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. This was a major victory for the civil rights movement. The museum has several interactive kiosks where patrons can access audio, images, text and video about the full civil rights movement. Visitors can search for text based on event, location, or theme. Many exhibits now feature \\"listening stations\\" where patrons with headphones can hear audio about the exhibit they are seeing; one features the voice of Malcolm X in a debate. More than 40 new short films throughout the museum also enhance the effect of the exhibits. In addition, museum presentations stress that the work continues; this is history that is part of the present; for instance, with challenges continuing on voting rights and other civil rights. The renovated museum opened to the public on April 5, 2014. The Associated Press review said, \\"The powerful, visceral exhibit[s set] the tone for an evocative, newly immersive museum experience that chronicles the history of the civil rights struggle in America.\\" King scholar Clayborne Carson of Stanford University said that the museum's renovations present \\"the best and most recent scholarship on civil rights available today.\\" Location and complex SW-NE View of the site. The complex is located at 450 Mulberry Street, with all properties except the Lorraine Motel owned by the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation. The motel is owned by the State of Tennessee and operated by the Foundation under a 20-year lease with the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville. The main museum is located on the south edge of downtown Memphis in what is now called the South Main Arts District. It is about six blocks east of the Mississippi River. The main site includes the museum, the Lorraine Motel, and associated buildings. The museum also owns the Young and Morrow Building at 422 Main Street. View of the room at the former boarding house from which Ray is believed to have fired the fatal shot.This was where James Earl Ray initially confessed (and later recanted) to shooting King. The complex includes Canipe's Amusement Store at 418 Main Street, next to the rooming house where the murder weapon with Ray's fingerprints was found. Included on these grounds is the brushy lot that stood between the rooming house and the motel. Replica of the Greyhound Bus destroyed by white supremacists during the Freedom Rides. The museum exhibits a number of vehicles of historic value or which are otherwise relevant to the time period. Vehicles on display include an International Harvester garbage truck in an exhibit on the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike that brought King to Memphis, James Earl Ray's Ford Mustang, a 1968 Cadillac and 1959 Dodge parked outside the motel, a re-creation of the burned shell of a Greyhound bus used by Freedom Riders, and a bus representative of the Montgomery bus boycott. Smith protest Jacqueline Smith protest vigil outside the Lorraine in October 2010. At the end, the Lorraine Motel housed temporary guests and residents as an SRO. The last resident was Jacqueline Smith, who had lived there since 1973 while working for the motel as a housekeeper. When the motel was closed in 1988, Smith was evicted. The neighborhood at the time around the Lorraine Motel was a lower-income, predominantly black area. The reconstruction of the neighborhood was related to other urban redevelopment projects in the downtown area. and the inclusion of the museum in the arts district. Smith and many others claim that the museum, as well as other components of urban redevelopment and the growth of the historical tourism industry, contributed to the gentrification of the South Main St. area. Smith argues that Dr. King would have likely preferred efforts to support struggling communities in Memphis, rather than projects that further uproot and alienate them. Smith’s belongings were piled across the street where she covered them with a tarp and set up camp and continued to live as she daily maintains her protest vigil to this day. As of November 29, 2018 she has held vigil for 30 years 308 days. She believes that by focusing too heavily on the violence of Dr. King's death instead of the work he did while alive, the museum is projecting precisely the opposite message Dr. King was attempting to spread. Corretta Scott King shared the view that focusing on Dr. King's violent death creates a narrative that precludes his vision and message of peace. She thought King would have objected to having $27 million spent on a building for him and to evicting motel residents, instead of on investing in policies and programs that would help communities of color and poor communities. Since her vigil began, Smith has spoken to thousands of visitors, attempting to spread Dr. Kings message and explain her thoughts about the museum. Smith has continued her protest vigil for over 30 years.

History As the British Mandate for Palestine was coming to an end, and following the United Nations General Assembly vote recommending the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine, which took place on 29 November 1947, Jewish leaders proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of a provisional government and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF proved complicated, and several paramilitary groups continued to be active outside the IDF. One of the largest groups, Irgun, planned to ship weapons and fighters to the newly formed state. The plans included a ship renamed Altalena (a nom de plume of Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky) and a target date for the ship's arrival from Europe was set to mid May 1948. The Altalena, former landing ship tank USS LST-138,LST-138 at NavSource Online: Amphibious Photo Archive. organized by Hillel Kook (a.k.a. Peter Bergson) purchased by Irgun members Gershon Hakim, Abraham Stavsky, and Victor Ben-Nachum, was originally intended to reach Israel on 15 May 1948, loaded with fighters and military equipment. Weapons valued at 153 million francs were donated by the French government, in accordance with a secret agreement approved by the French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault.Meir Zamir, \\"'Bid' for Altalena: France's covert action in the 1948 war in Palestine,\\" Middle Eastern Studies, vol 46 (2010) 17–58. Author's summary here. The exact text of the agreement has not been found, and the French motivation is unclear. However, it is known that Bidault was very concerned about the possibility of a Jordanian takeover of Jerusalem. Deputy Chief of Staff General Henri Coudraux, who was involved in the operation, told a 1949 enquiry that France had \\"reached a secret agreement with the Irgun, which promised it advantages if it were to come into power (in Israel).\\" He described the Irgun's representative in the negotiations, Shmuel Ariel, as \\"a terrorist who did not represent a legitimate organization and acted to take power by force.\\" According to Begin biographer Daniel Gordis, organizational matters took longer than expected, and the sailing was postponed for several weeks. Meanwhile, on 1 June, an agreement had been signed for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF and one of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to cease all independent arms acquisition activities. Consequently, Irgun informed the Israeli government about the Altalena. The Irgun headquarters in Paris did their best to keep the Altalenas preparations for departure a secret, but it was difficult to conceal the movement of 940 men and the loading of a large quantity of arms and ammunition. It was feared that if the plans were discovered, attempts might be made to sabotage the Altalena at sea. For this reason, when it raised anchor on June 11, no cable was sent to the Irgun command in Israel, for fear that it would fall into the wrong hands. These precautionary measures proved fruitless, however, and the following day Radio London reported that the Altalena had sailed from Port-de-Bouc, France in the direction of Israel with 940 Jewish volunteers and a large quantity of weapons on board. The first truce in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War had also begun on June 11 and when the Irgun leaders in Israel learned through the Radio London broadcast of the embarkation of the vessel, they feared that this breach of the truce conditions (i.e., the ban on bringing military equipment and fighters into the countryReport dated 16 September 1948 by the United Nations mediator on the observation of the truce in Palestine during the period from 11 June to 9 July 1948. ) would be revealed (though in the end, these aspects of the truce were ignored by both sides). Menachem Begin decided therefore to postpone the arrival of the ship, and the Irgun staff secretary, Zippora Levi-Kessel, sent a wireless message to the Altalena to stay put and await orders. A similar cable was sent to Shmuel Katz (member of the General Headquarters), who was then in Paris, but the ship had already left the day before the message arrived. On June 15, Begin and his comrades held a meeting with government representatives, at which Begin announced that the ship had sailed without his knowledge and that he wanted to hold consultations on how to proceed. In his diary for June 16, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the provisional government, wrote: > Yisrael [Galili] and Skolnik [Levi Eshkol] met yesterday with Begin. > Tomorrow or the next day their ship is due to arrive: 4,500 tons, bringing > 800–900 men, 5,000 rifles, 250 Bren guns, 5 million bullets, 50 bazookas, 10 > Bren carriers. Zipstein (director of Tel Aviv port) assumes that at night it > will be possible to unload it all. I believe we should not endanger Tel Aviv > port. They should not be sent back. They should be disembarked at an unknown > shore. Galili informed Begin of Ben-Gurion's consent to the landing of the ship, adding a request that it be done as fast as possible. Zippora Levi-Kessel then radioed the vessel to come in at full speed. The following day, a working meeting was held between Irgun representatives and Ministry of Defense personnel. While the Irgun proposed directing the Altalena to Tel Aviv beach, Ministry of Defense representatives claimed that the Kfar Vitkin beach was preferable, since it would be easier to evade UN observers there. The ship was therefore instructed to make for Kfar Vitkin. Confrontation with the IDF Intense negotiations between representatives of the provisional government (headed by Ben-Gurion) and the Irgun (headed by Begin) followed the departure of Altalena from France. Among the issues discussed were logistics of the ship's landing and distribution of the cargo. Whilst there was agreement on the anchoring place of the Altalena, there were differences of opinion about the cargo.Sinking the Altalena Ben-Gurion agreed to Begin's initial request that 20% of the weapons be dispatched to the Irgun's Jerusalem Battalion, which was still fighting independently. His second request that the remainder be transferred to the IDF to equip the newly incorporated Irgun battalions was rejected by the Government representatives, who interpreted the request as a demand to reinforce an \\"army within an army.\\" The Altalena reached Kfar Vitkin in the late afternoon of Sunday, June 20, greeted by Menachem Begin and a group of Irgun members on the shore. Irgun sympathizers from the nearby town of Netanya and residents of the fishing village of Mikhmoret gathered on the beach to help unload the cargo. After the ship dropped anchor, 940 passengers disembarked and were taken to an army camp for induction into the IDF.Altalena arms ship sunk by friendly fire, Haaretz Arms were unloaded throughout the night. In all, 2,000 rifles, two million rounds of ammunition, 3,000 shells, and 200 Bren guns were unloaded at Kfar Vitkin. Concomitantly with the events at Kfar Vitkin, the government had convened in Tel Aviv for its weekly meeting. Ben-Gurion reported on the meetings which had preceded the arrival of the Altalena and was adamant that Begin hand over the weapons: > We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease > his separate activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, > we must decide to disperse our own army. Kfar Vitkin 1949 1:20,000, jetty where Altalena unloaded marked The debate ended in a resolution to empower the army to use force if necessary. Implementation was assigned to the Alexandroni Brigade commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), which the following day surrounded the Kfar Vitkin area in two regiments equipped with armor and artillery. In addition, the Israeli Navy deployed three corvettes off Kfar Vitkin. Even issued the following ultimatum: > To: M. Begin > By special order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense > Forces, I am empowered to confiscate the weapons and military materials > which have arrived on the Israeli coast in the area of my jurisdiction in > the name of the Israel Government. I have been authorized to demand that you > hand over the weapons to me for safekeeping and to inform you that you > should establish contact with the supreme command. You are required to carry > out this order immediately. If you do not agree to carry out this order, I > shall use all the means at my disposal in order to implement the order and > to requisition the weapons which have reached shore and transfer them from > private possession into the possession of the Israel government. I wish to > inform you that the entire area is surrounded by fully armed military units > and armored cars, and all roads are blocked. I hold you fully responsible > for any consequences in the event of your refusal to carry out this order. > The immigrants—unarmed—will be permitted to travel to the camps in > accordance with your arrangements. You have ten minutes to give me your > answer. > D.E., Brigade Commander The ultimatum was made, according to Even, \\"in order not to give the Irgun commander time for lengthy considerations and to gain the advantage of surprise.\\" Begin did not respond. Claiming he needed more time, he drove to Netanya to consult directly with government leaders. A standoff between the IDF and Irgun members at the beach ensued as a UN observation plane circled overhead and recorded the incident. Failing to reach an accord, Begin returned to the beach and conferred with his officers. As evening began, rifle fire broke out. Which side fired first is a matter of dispute. Hillel Kook, an eyewitness, claimed it was the Irgun, which fired shots towards the sea to demonstrate their will to resist. As the fighting began, Begin fled to the Altalena in a rowboat, under fire from the corvettes offshore, and Captain Fein maneuvered the Altalena to shield Begin, enabling him to board safely. On shore, the Irgun fighters were forced to surrender. The IDF suffered two dead and six wounded, while the Irgun suffered six dead and eighteen wounded.Daniel Gordis: Menachem Begin: The Battle for Israel's Soul In order to prevent further bloodshed, the residents of Kfar Vitkin initiated negotiations between Yaakov Meridor (Begin's deputy) and Dan Even which ended in a general ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander.The Altalena AffairCastlewitz, David M.: The Altalena affair brought the newborn state of Israel to the brink of a minor civil war. (ISSN 0889-7328) Some of the crew of the Altalena. Bottom row center is Captain Monroe Fein. Meanwhile, Begin ordered the Altalena to sail to Tel Aviv, where there were more Irgun supporters. At 9:35 PM, the Altalena began cruising towards Tel Aviv. Many Irgun members, who had joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and assembled on the beach. Rumors began circulating that the Irgun was planning a military coup. According to the book Altalena by journalist and political analyst , Ben-Gurion instructed the Israeli Air Force to sink the ship on the high seas, long before it approached the shore. This would have resulted in much greater loss of life aboard. Gordon Levett, a Mahal volunteer pilot, wrote in his book Flying Under Two Flags that Heiman Shamir Deputy Commander of the Air Force, tried to convince non-Jewish pilot volunteers to attack the ship. However, three pilots refused to participate in the mission, one of them saying, \\"You can kiss my foot. I did not lose four friends and fly 10,000 miles in order to bomb Jews.\\" An IDF emplacement facing the Altalena in Tel Aviv The Altalena was shadowed by navy corvettes on its way to Tel Aviv. As the ship neared the coastline, the corvettes began firing at it with bursts of machine-gun fire, and stopped after fighters on board the Altalena answered with Bren guns mounted on the deck. The Altalena arrived at midnight, running aground on the busiest stretch of shore, at the foot of David Frischmann Street, in view of locals, journalists, and UN observers watching from the terrace of the Kaete Dan Hotel (today Dan Tel Aviv). In response, Ben-Gurion ordered Yigael Yadin (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. He also indicated to his Interior Minister that he would order the Israeli Navy to intercept any attempt by the Altalena to retreat into international waters. The IDF transferred heavy guns to the area and at four in the afternoon the next day, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the Altalena. The first gunner ordered to fire on the ship, a Red Army veteran named Yosef Aksen, refused, saying he was willing to be executed for insubordination and this would be \\"the best thing he did in his life.\\" Hillel Daleski, a recent immigrant from South Africa, at first protested, and told Shmuel Admon, the commander of the IDF Artillery Corps, that \\"I didn't come to the Land of Israel to fight against Jews\\", but relented after being threatened with a court-martial.Hillel Daleski, Israel Prize recipient for literature, dies at 84 Haaretz Yitzhak Rabin commanded the IDF and Palmach forces on the shore. One of the shells hit the ship, and it began to burn. Yigal Allon later claimed five or six shells were fired as warning shots and the ship was hit by accident.Silver, Eric (1984) \\"Begin. A Biography\\". Weidenfeld and Nicolson, , p. 107. IDF troops on the shore also directed heavy small-arms fire towards the ship, and employed heavy machine guns with armor-piercing rounds. Some soldiers refused to open fire on the Altalena, including a Palmach soldier whose brother, an Irgun officer, was on the ship.http://www.wertheimer.info/family/GRAMPS/Haapalah/ppl/5/5/bbf574590e71a2b9155.html Menachem Begin, hoping to avert civil war, ordered his men not to shoot back, and the ship raised the white flag. However, the firing continued, and some Irgun men on board reportedly returned fire. The Israeli corvettes also fired at the Altalena during the battle, and one crewman later claimed that IDF troops on the beach were hit by fire from one of the corvettes, which had aimed at the Altalena but overshot its target.Fire in the hole: Blasting the Altalena On the beach, a battle between the IDF and Irgun forces along the shore erupted, and clashes between IDF and Irgun units also took place throughout Tel Aviv, mainly in the south and center.This Week in History: The sinking of the ‘Altalena’ Fearing the fire would spread to the holds which contained explosives, Captain Monroe Fein ordered all aboard to abandon ship. People jumped into the water, whilst their comrades on shore set out to meet them on rafts. Begin biographer Daniel Gordis writes that although Captain Fein flew the white flag of surrender, automatic fire continued to be directed at the unarmed survivors swimming in the water. Begin, who was on deck, agreed to leave the ship only after the last of the wounded had been evacuated. Although civil war appeared imminent, a cease-fire was arranged by the evening of June 22. Mass arrests were carried out against Irgun soldiers who had joined their former comrades, and Irgun units in the IDF were disbanded, with their soldiers dispersed among other units. In all, more than 200 Irgun members were arrested. Most were released several weeks later, with the exception of five senior commanders (Moshe Hason, Eliyahu Lankin, Yaakov Meridor, Bezalel Amitzur, and Hillel Kook), who were detained for more than two months, until August 27, 1948. Eight IDF soldiers who refused to fire on the Altalena were court-martialed for insubordination. Meanwhile, Begin reached his clandestine radio station and ordered his men not to fight back. He called for them to assemble in Jerusalem and continue the battle for the Old City. Sixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army (all but three were veteran members and not newcomers from the ship); six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on Tel Aviv beach. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.Morris, 1948, p. 272: \\"Altogether eighteen men died in the clashes, most of them IZL\\".

The Altalena Affair exposed deep rifts between the main political factions in Israel, and is still occasionally referenced in Israeli media to illustrate the modern debate as to whether or not the use of force by the Israeli government against fringe Jewish political elements is legitimate. Proponents of Ben-Gurion's actions praised them as essential to establishing the Government's authority and discouraging factionalism and formation of rival armies. This was consistent with other actions he took, such as dissolving the Palmach later that year. Furthermore, Ben-Gurion's supporters have argued that a state must have a monopoly over the use of force. The Irgun, by attempting to import weapons to use as a private militia, was undermining the legitimacy of the fledgling State of Israel. Opponents condemned what they saw as unnecessary violence. The debate was reignited for a short time when Likud headed by Menachem Begin won the 1977 elections. Begin later said, \\"My greatest accomplishment was not retaliating and causing civil war\\". Years later, on the eve of the Six-Day War, in June 1967 (when Levi Eshkol was Prime Minister), Menachem Begin joined a delegation which visited Sde Boker to ask David Ben-Gurion to return and accept the premiership again. After that meeting, Ben-Gurion said that if he had then known Begin as he did now, the face of history would have been different.The Altalena Affair Jewish Virtual Library In 2012, the wreckage of the Altalena was discovered by marine experts hired by the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in a search effort that the Israeli government helped to fund. The search was initially based on Israeli Navy's coordinates on the location where it was sunk, but after failing to turn up results, the search area was expanded. The Altalena was eventually found sitting on the seabed several kilometers off the coast of Rishon LeZion at a depth of about 300 meters (around 984 feet). A sonar survey confirmed the ship's identity. The Israeli government subsequently announced plans to raise the wreck and install it on dry land as a monument.Government seeks to salvage the AltalenaReport: Altalena wreckage located Legacy The first memorial to the 16 Irgun fighters and 3 IDF soldiers killed in the Altalena sinking was erected in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim in 1998. The official government memorial ceremony for the victims is held annually on the cemetery grounds. The ceremony is primarily attended by relatives of the victims and political personalities identified with Israel's national camp. In 2011, invitations circulated by Israel's Ministry of Defense used the word murdered in reference to the fighters who lost their lives in the incident, implying that Ben-Gurion, Rabin, and the IDF had committed murder. Defense Minister Ehud Barak subsequently demanded that the \\"severe mishap\\" be investigated and corrected. Speaker of the Knesset at the time and subsequently President of Israel Reuven Rivlin said at the ceremony that the Altalena Affair was an unatonable crime. Trivia For years after the sinking of the ship, courageous children used to swim towards it, climb aboard and take pieces of ammunition from it home.אמנון דנקנר, דוד טרטקובר, איפה היינו ומה עשינו.

F., and S. Sarkar. 2000. \\"Embracing Complexity: Organicism for the 21st Century.\\" Develop Dynam 219: 1–9. Vital to the position is the idea that organicistic elements are not dormant \\"things\\" per se but rather dynamic components in a comprehensive system that, too, is ever-changing. Organicism is related to, although remains distinct from, holism insofar as organicism prefigures holism; and the latter concept is applied within a broader scope to universal part-whole interconnections—such as anthropology and sociology—and the former is traditionally confined to philosophical and biological applications.Charles Wolfe. HOLISM, ORGANICISM AND THE RISK OF BIOCHAUVINISM. Verifiche. Rivista di scienze umana, 2014 Further, organicism is incongruous with reductionism, as well, for its (i.e. organicism's) consideration of \\"both bottom-up and top- down causation.\\" Regarded as a fundamental tenet in the realm of natural philosophy, organicism has remained a vital current alongside both reductionist and mechanist approaches that have guided scientific inquiry since the early 17th century.For example, the philosophers of the Ionian Enlightenment were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as hylozoists meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see Farrington (1941/53)For a general overview see Capra (1996) Though there remains dissent among scientific historians concerning organicism's pregeneration, most scholars deem ancient Athens its birthplace. Thus, surfacing in Athenian writing in the 4th-century B.C.E., Plato is among the first philosophers to consider the universe an intelligent living (almost sentient) being, first positing organicism in his Socratic dialogue, Philebus, and further expanding upon the notion in the later works of Republic and Theatetus. At the turn of the 18th-century, Immanuel Kant championed a revival of organicisitic thought by stressing, in his written works, \\"the inter-relatedness of the organism and its parts[,] and the circular causality\\" inherent to the inextricable entanglement of the greater whole. Organicism flourished for a period during the German Romanticism intellectual movement, where the position was considered by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling to be an integral constituent within the burgeoning biological field. Within contemporary biology, organicism stresses the organization (particularly the self-organizing properties) rather than the composition (i.e. the reduction into biological components) of organisms. John Scott Haldane was the first modern biologist to use the term to expand his philosophical stance in 1917; other 20th-century academics and professionals—such as Theodor Adorno and Albert Dalcq—have followed in Haldane's wake. French zoologist Yves Delage, in his seminal text L'Hérédité Et Les Grands Problèmes de la Biologie Générale, describes organicism thus: > [L]ife, the form of the body, the properties and characters of its diverse > parts, as resulting from the reciprocal play or struggle of all its > elements, cells, fibres, tissues, organs, which act the one on the other, > modify one the other, allot among them each its place and part, and lead all > together to the final result, giving thus the appearance of a consensus, or > a pre-established harmony, where in reality there is nothing but the result > of independent phenomena. In philosophy Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and reductionism (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects vitalism, the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As CapraFritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996. puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006. A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior. Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from monism (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe) to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts. Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in symbolic logic, in phenomenology, or in metaphysics. William Wimsatt has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance. Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. \\"Holism,\\" the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by \\"holistic medicine\\" and by New Age Thought. German Nazism appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet Dialectical Materialism also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from Hegel via Karl Marx's co-worker Friedrich Engels, again giving a controversial political association to organicism. Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, Paul von Lilienfeld, Jacques Novicow, Albert Schäffle, Herbert Spencer, and René Worms, among others.Daniela Barberis, \\"In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France\\", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54. Thomas Hobbes arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the Leviathan, he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism. In biology In breathing entities, cells, the smallest unit of life, were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.\\"biology\\". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 . Further, as Capra puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from \\"the parts to the whole\\" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology. In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology, Joseph Needham, Journal of Philosophical Studies 1928 . Accessed Jan 2011 Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are Ross Harrison, Paul Weiss, and Joseph Needham. Donna Haraway discusses them in her first book Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields. John Scott Haldane (father of J. B. S. Haldane), William Emerson Ritter, Edward Stuart Russell, Joseph Henry Woodger, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists.

Columbia University Press, New York =Theoretical Biology Club= In the early 1930s Joseph Henry Woodger and Joseph Needham, together with Conrad Hal Waddington, John Desmond Bernal, Dorothy Needham, and Dorothy Wrinch, formed the Theoretical Biology Club, to promote the organicist approach to biology. The club was in opposition to mechanism, reductionism and the gene- centric view of evolution.

PA was established in 1971 as a segregation academy and remains as the only independent, non-sectarian, college preparatory school in Arkansas.  History  When busing was introduced in the early 1970s to counteract the effects of racially defined residential patterns, whites built private schools in the suburbs or fled the county altogether. In 1971, the segregationist businessman William F. Rector announced the construction of the private Pulaski Academy in the western suburbs of the city for those, he said, who \\"don't like busing.\\" Pulaski was the first school established after the Swann v. Charlotte- Mecklenburg Board of Education decision (1971). Rector said, \\"I even hope we'll be allowed to play Dixie if we want to without having a riot about it.\\" In 2003, one of 102 graduating seniors was black. In the 2015–2016 school year, 955 of 1,221 students in grades 1-12 were white (78%). In 2016, Little Rock was 48% white. In 2000, Pulaski Academy purchased the campus of Fellowship Bible Church, on the corner of Hinson and Napa Valley, increasing the campus to .

The towns of Bristol and Warren, Rhode Island were significantly damaged, and Freetown, Massachusetts (present- day Fall River) was also attacked, although its militia resisted British attacks more successfully. The British destroyed military defenses in the area, including supplies that had been cached by the Continental Army in anticipation of an assault on British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. Homes as well as municipal and religious buildings were also destroyed in the raids. On May 25, 500 British and Hessian soldiers, under orders from General Sir Robert Pigot, the commander of the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, landed between Bristol and Warren, destroyed boats and other supplies, and plundered Bristol. Local resistance was minimal and ineffective in stopping the British activities. Six days later, 100 soldiers descended on Freetown, where less damage was done because local defenders prevented the British from crossing a bridge. Background In December 1776, after completing the conquest of New York City, British Lieutenant General William Howe detached a body of troops from his army which occupied Newport, Rhode Island without significant opposition.Dearden, p. 7 The Newport garrison came under the command of Brigadier General Sir Robert Pigot when the original commander, Brigadier General Richard Prescott, was captured in the summer of 1777 in a daring commando operation led by Continental Army Major and Warren, Rhode Island, native William Barton.Dearden, p. 13 Since the British occupation began American and British forces had been in a standoff. Major General Joseph Spencer had been ordered by Major General George Washington to launch an assault on Newport in 1777, but he had not done so, and was removed from command of the Rhode Island defenses. In March 1778 Congress approved the appointment of Major General John Sullivan to Rhode Island. By early May, Sullivan had arrived in the state and produced a detailed report on the situation there.Murray, p. 6 He also began logistical preparations for an attack on Newport, caching equipment and supplies on the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay and the Taunton River. General Pigot was alerted to Sullivan's preparations by a local Loyalist, and organized an expedition to raid Bristol and Warren.Murray, p. 8Dearden, pp. 25–27 On the evening of May 24 he ordered a force of 500 British and Hessian soldiers under the command of the 22nd Regiment's Lieutenant Colonel James Campbell to march to the northern end of Aquidneck Island, from where they took whaleboats across to the mainland. Warren and Bristol raid Arriving early on May 25, Campbell's forces landed on Bristol Neck, between Bristol and Warren. Campbell divided his force in two, sending one detachment into Warren, and the other to areas along the Kickamuit River where boats and other supplies were cached. The latter force destroyed 58 of 70 small boats that General Spencer had originally stored there, along with other military supplies and a corn mill. They burned down a bridge that crossed the river, and set fire to a sloop. After the British left, locals put out the fire on the sloop, which only suffered minor damage.Dearden, p. 25 A 1984 USGS map showing Mount Hope Bay and the communities that were raided. Fall River was then part of Freetown. The Warren detachment had expected some resistance upon reaching the town, but Continental Army forces, numbering about 300 under the command of Colonel Archibald Clary, had fled the town upon rumors that the British force was much larger than it actually was. The British destroyed military supplies, and set fire to the local powder magazine. The ensuing explosion destroyed six homes and the town's meeting house. The troops also burned a sloop and destroyed five cannon. As they marched from the town, the first signs of organized resistance began to appear. The two British detachments rejoined and headed for Bristol.Dearden, p. 26 Word of the British landing had reached Providence, and Colonel Barton immediately sprang into action. Recruiting about 200 volunteers, he rushed south, turned Clary's retreating force around, and caught up with the British shortly after they left Warren, heading for Bristol. The two forces skirmished as the British marched southward, with both sides incurring minor casualties. The notable exception was Colonel Barton, who took a musket ball that did him sufficient damage that it effectively ended his military career, although he continued to fight on that day. Campbell's men reached Bristol in good order despite the ongoing skirmishes, and engaged in a destructive rampage. In addition to military supplies and cannon, they destroyed 22 homes and a church, and looted everywhere, making, according to one account, \\"no distinction between their Friends and Foes\\".Dearden, p. 27 Their work completed around noon, the British returned to their boats. They embarked, covered by the guns of the frigate HMS Flora and HM galley Pigot, and returned to Aquidneck Island and Newport. The raid prompted General Sullivan to renew calls to area governors for increased militia assistance. This recruiting did not have material effect before the next raid occurred. The May 25 raids also included the capture of an anchored American galley, the Spitfire, near the entrance to the Taunton River.Lieutenant Frederick Mackenzie diary, May 25, 1778 entry Freetown raid Pigot next organized a smaller raiding force to go to lower Freetown (a portion that was later separated to form Fall River). On the night of May 30, a force of 100 men led by Major Edmund Eyre (who had served under Campbell in the previous raid) embarked from Arnold's Point on Aquidneck Island in flat- bottomed boats under the escort of several naval vessels, including the aforementioned HMS Flora and Pigot.Pigot, pp. 25-26 The Pigot ran aground while passing through Bristol Ferry, but the rest sailed up the Taunton River,Dearden, p. 28 and landed near the mouth of the Quequechan River in lower Freetown on the morning of Sunday, May 31.Deane, p. 216 (note that Deane incorrectly dates the raid to May 25, the date of the Warren/Bristol raid) The local militia was under the command of Colonel Joseph Durfee (going by the title of Captain at the time), a Continental Army veteran, and had established a watch. The British landing was spotted by a sentinel and the alarm was raised. Forty men, including militia from Freetown and nearby Tiverton, mustered to give resistance. Eyre's men fired grapeshot from a small cannon and slowly pushed the militiamen uphill.Deane, p. 217 As this took place, some of his men proceeded to burn a house, grist mill and sawmill, nine boats, and 15,000 feet of planking. The militia eventually reached a bridge across a stream, where about 25 men established a defensive line behind a stone wall on the far side. In a battle lasting about 90 minutes, Durfee's men repulsed repeated attempts by Eyre's men to gain control of the bridge. The British soldiers then took one local resident prisoner, set fire to his property, and retreated to their boats. The militia followed, harassing the soldiers with musket fire. On their return to port, the British naval vessels worked to assist the Pigot, which had been grounded; in the process of doing so, they came under fire from an American battery on shore (which, by at least one account, included cannon-launched stone and spare iron)J. R. Elsbree, 1895, \\"Battle of Fall River: Stray Leaves from a Note Book of the Happenings of Olden Days\\", reproduced in Reed, p. 256 and suffered additional casualties (three killed and one wounded according to one account). The Pigot also sustained significant damage from the American battery. Some accounts describe the American prisoner (an elderly man named Richard Borden) as being aboard one of the boats coming under fire; these accounts describe the prisoner seeking shelter by laying flat on the floor of the vessel, despite attempts of his captors to have him stand (perhaps to try to dissuade the attackers); according to these accounts, one or two of the captors were eventually hit by shots from the Americans on shore.Durfee, p. 7S. A. Chase, March 24, 1897 article in Fall River Evening News, reproduced in Reed, p. 251 The prisoner was eventually released several days later. In addition to the casualties at Bristol Ferry, the British suffered two killed and five wounded in the battle at Freetown, while the Americans suffered no casualties beyond the one captive, who apparently emerged without any noteworthy injury.Deane, p. 218 Aftermath The destruction of the boats and supplies was a minor setback to American plans. In mid-July, General Washington informed Sullivan that a French fleet was available to assist in operations against Newport.Dearden, p. 38 This had a galvanizing effect on recruiting, and local shipbuilders embarked on a crash boatbuilding program to replace the boats destroyed in the raid.Dearden, pp. 49–51 By early August, the French fleet of the Comte d'Estaing had arrived off Newport, and Sullivan commanded a force of 10,000 militia and regular army troops.Ward, p. 588 Bad weather and the timely arrival of a British fleet to oppose d'Estaing frustrated allied plans.Ward, pp. 590–591 Sullivan, who had occupied the northern part of Aquidneck Island, was forced to retreat by the mass desertion of militia after the French withdrew their fleet and troops. General Pigot then broke out of his lines in pursuit, but Sullivan successfully fought off his attack in the Battle of Rhode Island on August 29 before retreating off Aquidneck Island.Ward, p. 592 The British occupied Newport until October 1779, when the garrison was withdrawn for operations elsewhere.Field, p. 246 The raided communities continued to contribute to the American war effort despite the damage and difficulties caused by the raids.Munro, pp. 240–242Baker, p. 23 Major Edmund Eyre, leader of the Freetown raid, was by 1781 promoted to lieutenant colonel, when he again led British forces during a raid on New London and Groton, Connecticut on September 6 of the same year. He was wounded early in the Battle of Groton Heights, and his troops were accused of engaging in atrocities in the aftermath of the battle.Allyn, p. 102; see accounts in Allyn for detailed accusations.

It is located in parts of the southern Virginia independent cities of Chesapeake and Suffolk and northern North Carolina counties of Gates, Pasquotank, and Camden. Some estimates place the size of the original swamp at over , stretching from Norfolk, Virginia, to Edenton, North Carolina. Lake Drummond, a natural lake, is located in the heart of the swamp. The lake, a remarkably circular body of water, is one of only two natural lakes in Virginia. Along the Great Dismal Swamp's eastern edge runs the Dismal Swamp Canal, completed in 1805. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1973 when the Union Camp Corporation of Franklin, Virginia, donated of land after centuries of logging and other human activities devastated the swamp's ecosystems. The refuge was officially established through the Dismal Swamp Act of 1974, and today consists of over of forested wetlands. Outside the boundaries of the refuge, the state of North Carolina has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp through the establishment of the Dismal Swamp State Park. The park protects of forested wetland. A remnant of the original swamp was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1973, in recognition of its unique combination of geological and ecological features. History Refugee slaves in the Great Dismal Swamp before the Civil War, painted 1888 The origin of Lake Drummond is not entirely clear as there is no apparent network of natural streams emptying into the lake. Archaeological evidence suggests varying cultures of humans have inhabited the swamp for 13,000 years. In 1650, Algonquian-speaking Native Americans of coastal tribes lived in the swamp. In 1665, William Drummond, the first governor of North Carolina, was the first European recorded as discovering the swamp's lake, which was subsequently named for him.Harper, Raymond L. (2008). A History of Chesapeake, Virginia, pp. 124–28. The History Press. In 1728, William Byrd II, while leading a land survey to establish a boundary between the Virginia and North Carolina colonies, made many observations of the swamp, none of them favorable; he is credited with naming it the Dismal Swamp. Settlers did not appreciate the ecological importance of wetlands. In 1763, George Washington visited the area, and he and others founded the Dismal Swamp Company in a venture to drain the swamp and clear it for settlement.Grizzard, Frank E., Jr. (2002). George Washington: A Biographical Companion, pp. 86–87. ABC-CLIO. The company later turned to the more profitable goal of timber harvesting.Traylor (2010), pp. 165–66. Several African-American maroon societies lived in the Great Dismal Swamp during early American history. These Great Dismal Swamp maroons consisted of black refugee slaves who had escaped to seek safety and liberty.Kate Taylor, \\"The Thorny Path to a National Black Museum\\", The New York Times, January 22, 2011, Accessed January 31, 2011. Excavations reveal island communities existing until the Civil War. Charlie, a maroon who worked illegally in a lumber camp in the swamp, later recalled that there were whole families of maroons living in the Dismal Swamp, some of whom had never seen a white man and would be terrified if they did. The swamp's role in the history of slavery in the United States is reflected in Harriet Beecher Stowe's second novel, Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp. The Underground Railroad Education Pavilion, an exhibit set up to educate visitors about the fugitive slaves who lived in the swamp, was opened February 24, 2012. The Dismal Swamp Canal was authorized by Virginia in 1787 and by North Carolina in 1790. Construction began in 1793 and was completed in 1805. The canal, as well as a railroad constructed through part of the swamp in 1830, enabled the harvest of timber. The canal deteriorated after the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal was completed in 1858. In 1929, the United States Government bought the Dismal Swamp Canal and began to improve it. The canal is now the oldest operating artificial waterway in the country. Like the Albemarle and Chesapeake canals, it is part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. Preservation Forested wetland within the Great Dismal Swamp In the mid-20th century, conservation groups across the United States began demanding the preservation of the remaining Great Dismal Swamp and restoration of its wetlands, by then understood as critical habitat for a wide variety of birds, animals, plants, and other living things. This area is along the Atlantic Flyway of migrating species. In 1973, the Union Camp Corporation, a paper company based in Franklin, Virginia, with large land holdings in the area, donated just over of land to The Nature Conservancy, which the following year transferred the property to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Yarsinske, Amy Waters (2007). The Elizabeth River, pp. 328-29. The History Press. During this time, a portion of the swamp was declared a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1973 due to its unique combination of geological and ecological features. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was officially established by the U.S. Congress through the Dismal Swamp Act of 1974. The refuge consists of almost of forested wetlands, including the Lake Drummond at its center. The refuge's resource management programs aim to restore and maintain the natural biological diversity that once existed in the swamp, including its water resources, native vegetation communities, and wildlife species. Water control structures in the ditches help conserve and manage water, while forest management activities that simulate the ecological effects of wildfires are used to restore and maintain plant diversity. Wildlife is managed by ensuring the presence of required habitats, with hunting used to balance some wildlife populations with available food supplies. Today Black bear within the Great Dismal Swamp The Great Dismal Swamp lies wholly within the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion. The swamp harbors a wide range of plant and animal species. Bald cypress, tupelo, maple, Atlantic white cypress, and pine, among other tree species found on the refuge, support the fauna within. (In a survey undertaken from 1973 to 1976, some 334 plants from 100 plant families were found.)Musselman, L. J., Nickrent, D. L. & Levy, G. F. (1977) A contribution towards a vascular flora of the Great Dismal Swamp. Rhodora 79:240-268. The swamp is home to many mammals, including black bears, bobcats, otters, and weasels, as well as over 70 species of reptile and amphibian. More than 200 bird species can be seen within the swamp throughout the year, including 96 nesting species. Lake Drummond is the center of activity in the swamp today, attracting fishermen, sightseers, and boaters. Camping is not allowed on the refuge.

It was directed by Roland Joffé and produced by David Puttnam for his company Goldcrest Films. Sam Waterston stars as Schanberg, Haing S. Ngor as Pran, Julian Sands as Jon Swain, and John Malkovich as Al Rockoff. The adaptation for the screen was written by Bruce Robinson; the musical score was written by Mike Oldfield and orchestrated by David Bedford. The film was a success at the box office and an instant hit with critics. At the 57th Academy Awards it received seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture; it won three, most notably Best Supporting Actor for Haing S. Ngor, who had no previous acting experience, as well as Best Cinematography and Best Editing. At the 38th British Academy Film Awards, it won eight BAFTAs, including Best Film and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Ngor. In 1999 the British Film Institute voted The Killing Fields the 100th greatest British film of the 20th century. In 2016 British film magazine Empire ranked it number 86 in their list of the 100 best British films. Plot In the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, during May 1973, the Cambodian national army wages a civil war with the communist Khmer Rouge group, a result of the Vietnam War spilling over Cambodia's borders. Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for The New York Times, awaits the arrival of reporter Sydney Schanberg at the city's airport but leaves suddenly. Schanberg takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with Al Rockoff. Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an incident has occurred in a town, Neak Leung; allegedly, an American B-52 has bombed the town. Schanberg and Pran go to Neak Leung where they find that the town has been bombed. Schanberg and Pran are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army. Two years later, in 1975, the Phnom Penh embassies are evacuated in anticipation of the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran, his wife and their four children. However, Pran insists on staying behind to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg meets Rockoff. They are later met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. The group is taken through the city to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates to spare the lives of his friends. They do not leave Phnom Penh, but instead retreat to the French embassy. The Khmer Rouge orders all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over. Fearing an attack from the Khmer Rouge, the ambassador complies. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain of The Sunday Times try to forge a British passport for Pran, but the deception fails when the image of Pran on the passport photo fades to nothing, as they lack adequate photographic developer. Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and is forced to live under their totalitarian regime. Several months after returning to New York City, Schanberg is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate Pran; he writes letters to several charities and is in close contact with Pran's family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge's \\"Year Zero\\" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where many undergo re-education. As intellectuals are made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape, but is recaptured. Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he stumbles upon one of the infamous killing fields of the Pol Pot regime, where as many as 2 million Cambodian citizens were murdered. In 1976, Schanberg is awarded a Pulitzer prize for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict. During the ceremony, he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. Schanberg is confronted in the restroom by Rockoff, who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Although Schanberg initially defends his efforts, he ultimately admits that Pran stayed because of what Schanberg wanted. Pran is assigned to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to Phat's young son. Pran continues to behave as an uneducated peasant, despite several attempts by Phat to catch him in his deception. Phat begins to trust Pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. During the Khmer Rouge's border war with Vietnam, Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot. In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat's son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with the fourth man. However, Pran's companion activates a hidden land mine while holding the boy. As Pran pleads with the man to give him the boy, the mine goes off, killing the pair. Pran continues through the jungle alone until he eventually finds a Red Cross camp near the border of Thailand. In the United States, Schanberg receives news that Pran is alive and safe, and he travels to the Red Cross camp and is reunited with Pran. He asks Pran to forgive him; Pran answers, with a smile, \\"Nothing to forgive, Sydney\\", as the two embrace. Cast * Sam Waterston as Sydney Schanberg * Haing S.

Critical reception The Killing Fields holds a 93% rating at the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews from notable publications, with the consensus; \\"Artfully composed, powerfully acted, and fueled by a powerful blend of anger and empathy, The Killing Fields is a career-defining triumph for director Roland Joffé and a masterpiece of American cinema.\\" Critic Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times: \\"The film is a masterful achievement on all the technical levels—it does an especially good job of convincing us with its Asian locations—but the best moments are the human ones, the conversations, the exchanges of trust, the waiting around, the sudden fear, the quick bursts of violence, the desperation.\\" =Accolades= Academy Awards * Best Picture (David Puttnam) - Nominated * Best Director (Roland Joffé) - Nominated * Best Actor (Sam Waterston) - Nominated * Best Supporting Actor (Haing S.

Home media The Killing Fields was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in Australia in March 2010. The DVD includes special features such as the theatrical trailer, audio commentary with Roland Joffé, an interview with David Puttnam and a BBC documentary titled The Making of The Killing Fields. In April 2013 Umbrella Entertainment released the film on Blu- ray in Australia. In the UK, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Optimum Releasing and was released in North America on DVD by Warner Brothers, as part of their Warner Archive Collection.  Casting of Haing S. Ngor  Haing S. Ngor, who plays Pran, was himself a survivor of the Khmer Rouge regime and the labour camps. Prior to the Khmer Rouge's 'Year Zero' he was a doctor based in Phnom Penh. In 1975, Ngor was one of millions who were moved from the city to forced labour camps in the countryside. He spent four years there before fleeing to Thailand. Haing S. Ngor had never acted before appearing in The Killing Fields. He was spotted by the film's casting director, Pat Golden, at a Cambodian wedding in Los Angeles. Of his role in the film, he told People magazine in 1985: \\"I wanted to show the world how deep starvation is in Cambodia, how many people die under Communist regime. My heart is satisfied. I have done something perfect.\\" Ngor became one of only two non-professional actors to win an Academy Award for acting, the other being Harold Russell (The Best Years of Our Lives, 1946). Related work The screenplay is adapted from a Sydney Schanberg story in The New York Times Magazine entitled \\"The Death and Life of Dith Pran: A Story of Cambodia\\". In 1986, actor Spalding Gray, who had a small role in the film as the American consul, created Swimming to Cambodia, a monologue (later filmed by Jonathan Demme) based upon his experiences making The Killing Fields. A book of the film was written by Christopher Hudson.

Morell was well known in Germany for his unconventional treatments. He assisted Hitler daily in virtually everything he did for several years and was beside Hitler until the last stages of the Battle of Berlin. Morell was granted high awards by Hitler, and became a multi-millionaire from business deals with the Nazi government made possible by his status. Early years Morell was the second son of a primary school teacher, born and raised in the small village of Trais- Münzenberg in Upper Hesse. A 1945 newspaper article described him as half- Jewish.Hitler had split personality, The Guardian, 22 May 1945 He studied medicine in Grenoble and Paris, then trained in obstetrics and gynecology in Munich in 1910. On 23 May 1913, he completed his doctoral degree and was fully licensed as a physician. He served as a ship's doctor until 1914, when he volunteered for service at the Front during the First World War. Morell served as an army battalion medical officer until 1917. By 1918, he was in Berlin with his own medical practice, and in 1920 he married Hannelore Moller, a wealthy actress. He furnished his office with the latest medical technology through his wife's fortune.Ohler, Norman (2017) Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. p.20 He targeted his unconventional treatments at an upscale market, his practice becoming fashionable for treatment of skin and venereal diseases, and turned down invitations to be personal physician to both the Shah of Persia and the King of Romania. Career =Hitler's physician= Morell joined the Nazi Party when Hitler came to power in 1933. In 1935, Hitler's personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, was successfully treated by Morell. Hoffmann told Hitler that Morell had saved his life. Hitler met Morell in 1936, and Morell began treating Hitler with various commercial preparations, including a combination of vitamins and hydrolyzed E. coli bacteria called Mutaflor, which successfully treated Hitler's severe stomach cramps. Through Morell's prescriptions, a leg rash which Hitler had developed also disappeared. Hitler was convinced of Morell's medical genius and Morell became part of his social inner circle. Some historians have attempted to explain this by citing Morell's reputation in Germany for success in treating syphilis, along with Hitler's own (speculated) fears of the disease, which he associated closely with Jews. Others have commented on the possibility that Hitler had visible symptoms of Parkinson's disease, especially towards the end of the war. Hitler recommended Morell to others of the Nazi leadership, but most of them, including Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, dismissed Morell as a quack. As Albert Speer related in his autobiography: When Hitler was troubled with grogginess in the morning, Morell would inject him with a solution of water mixed with a substance from several small, gold-foiled packets, which he called \\"Vitamultin\\". Hitler would arise, refreshed and invigorated. Hitler gave a packet to Himmler, who immediately became suspicious and instead secretly ordered one of his SS physicians, Ernst-Günther Schenck, to have it tested in a laboratory. It was found to contain methamphetamine. On at least one occasion, Hitler ordered his private train stopped so that Morell could inject him without worrying about the train jostling. Speer characterised Morell as an opportunist, who once he achieved status as Hitler's physician, became extremely careless and lazy in his work. By 1944, Morell developed a hostile rivalry with Dr. Karl Brandt, who had been attending Hitler since 1934. Though criticized by Brandt and other physicians, Morell was always \\"restored to favor\\". Morell was not popular with Hitler's entourage, who complained about the doctor's crude table manners, poor hygiene and body odor. Hitler is said to have responded \\"I do not employ him for his fragrance, but to look after my health.\\"Bathroom Readers' Institute \\"The Story of Hitler's Illness\\" Uncle John's Endlessly Engrossing Bathroom Reader Hermann Göring called Morell Der Reichsspritzenmeister, (\\"Reich Master of Injections\\"), and variations on that theme,Junge, Traudi (2003) Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. implying that Morell resorted to using drug injections when faced with medical problems, and overused them. =Substances administered to Hitler= Morell kept a medical diary of the drugs, tonics, vitamins and other substances he administered to Hitler, usually by injection (up to 20 times per day) or in pill form. Most were commercial preparations, some were Morell's own mixes. Since some of these compounds are considered toxic, historians have speculated that Morell inadvertently contributed to Hitler's deteriorating health. The fragmentary list (below) of some 74 substances (in 28 different mixtures) administered to Hitler include psychoactive drugs such as heroin as well as commercial poisons. Among the compounds, in alphabetical order, were: directed and produced by Chris Durlacher. A Waddell Media Production for Channel 4 in association with National Geographic Channels, MMXIV.

An almost complete listing of the drugs used by Morell, wrote historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, was compiled after the war from his own meticulous daily records unlikely to have been exaggerated. =World War II= In 1939, Morell inadvertently became involved with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak president, Emil Hacha, became so scared at Hitler's outburst that he fainted. Morell injected stimulants into Hacha to wake him, and although he claimed these were only vitamins, they may have included methamphetamine. Hacha soon gave in to Hitler's demands. When Reinhard Heydrich, who was serving as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia - the rump left of Czechoslovakia after Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland - was the victim of an assassination attempt in May 1942, Morell was one of the doctors brought in by Heinrich Himmler to treat the badly-wounded SS man. Despite this, gangrene set in, and Heydrich died a week later. After the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt against Hitler, Morell treated him with topical penicillin, which had only recently been introduced into testing by the U.S. Army. Where he acquired it is unknown, and Morell claimed complete ignorance of penicillin when he was interrogated by American intelligence officers after the war. When members of Hitler's inner circle were interviewed for the book The Bunker, some claimed Morell owned a significant share in a company fraudulently marketing a product as penicillin. When Hitler developed jaundice in September 1944, Dr. Erwin Geising - an ear, nose and throat specialist who had originally been brought in to treat the dictator after the damage done to his eardrums from the bomb explosion of the 20 July plot - began to be suspicious of Morell's treatment of Hitler. Suspecting that he knew the cause of the jaundice, Geising deliberately dosed himself with some of the \\"Dr. Koester's Anti-Gas Pills\\" which Morell had Hitler taking in large numbers every day, and found that they had effects that were mildly harmful. Having them analyzed, he found they contained strychnine and belladonna, the strychnine being the cause of the jaundice. Geising reported his results to two of Hitler's other doctors, Karl Brandt and Hanskarl von Hasselbach, who in turn told other members of Hitler's retinue. When word of this finally reached Hitler, he was furious. Declaring that he had total faith in Morell and his treatments, he dismissed all three doctors - Geising, Brandt and Hasselbach - even though the latter two had been with him since his early days in power. Several months later, Brandt was imprisoned and condemned to death at the Nuremberg trials. By April 1945, Hitler was taking many pills a day, along with numerous injections. The personal notes of Morell describe how he treated Hitler over the years, including notations such as, \\"injection as always\\", and, \\"Eukodal\\", an early German trade name for the opioid oxycodone. Morell was one of the occupants of the Führerbunker, located in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, once Hitler and his entourage relocated there from the Wolf's Lair in Rastenburg in East Prussia. As the Battle of Berlin progressed and the outlook became dire, it was Morell who provided the cyanide capsules which Eva Braun would later use to kill herself, and which Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda used to murder their six children before killing themselves. On 20 April 1945, Morell, Albert Bormann, Admiral Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, Dr. Hugo Blaschke, secretaries Johanna Wolf, Christa Schroeder, and several others were ordered by Hitler to leave the bunker and Berlin by aircraft for the Obersalzberg. Hitler told Morell he did not need any more medical help, although he continued to take many of the medications Morell had prescribed for him; during the last week of Hitler's life, it was administered by Dr. Werner Haase and by Heinz Linge, Hitler's valet. The group flew out of Berlin on different flights by aircraft of the Fliegerstaffel des Führers over the following three days. Morell was on the flight which left Berlin on 23 April. Personal awards and wealth Hitler awarded Morell the title of Professor and gave him the Golden Party Badge and the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross.PROZESSE / HITLERS LEIBARZT: Auf Rotglut - DER SPIEGEL 18/1969 Morell was able to use his relationship with Hitler to sell his \\"Vitamultin\\" to the German Labor Front and his delousing product \\"Rußla powder\\" to the Wehrmacht. In addition to an annual salary of 60,000 Reichsmark, these business ventures earned Morell a fortune of about seven million Reichsmark. Final years and death Morell was captured by American forces and interrogated on 18 May 1945. One of his interrogators was reportedly \\"disgusted\\" by his obesity and lack of hygiene. Although he was held in an American internment camp on the site of the former Buchenwald concentration camp, and questioned because of his proximity to Hitler, Morell was never charged with a crime. Grossly obese and suffering from poor health, he died in a Tegernsee hospital on 26 May 1948.

The Sacramento perch's native habitat is in sluggish, heavily vegetated, waters of sloughs and lakes. It can reach a maximum overall length of and a maximum weight of , and it has been reported to live as long as six years. Its adaptability to different habitats is high, and it can survive on a wide variety of food sources. As young perch, they consume mainly small crustaceans and eventually move on to insect larvae and then smaller fish as adults.  Taxonomy  Archoplites interruptus belongs to the family Centrarchidae. This family mainly includes species of sunfish. Although called the Sacramento perch, A. interruptus is not a perch strictly speaking; the perches are members of the genus Perca in the family Percidae. This species is also the only member of the centrarchids that resides west of the Rockies.Moyle, P.B. (1976) Inland Fishes of California. University of California Press, pp. 376–380. A. interruptus is currently the only species of genus Archoplites, but Girard had originally assigned it to Centrarchus. The generic name, Archoplites, derives from the Greek άρχος (ruler) and οπλίτης (bearing a shield). Interruptus references the irregular vertical bar markings on the sides of the fish.  Description  This species is a deep-bodied fish with long dorsal and anal fins. The mouth is large with numerous small teeth found on its jaws, tongue, and roof of its mouth. Its scales are large and brown on the sides and top of the fish and create a metallic greenish-purple shine. The Sacramento perch is most identifiable by its irregular vertical bars. Breeding males and females are slightly sexually dimorphic in color. The males become darker and have purple opercula (hard, bony flap that protects the gills). The color in females is plainer with spotted opercula. Its size is dependent on how old the fish is. A Sacramento perch at age 1 would measure 6–13 cm, at age 2 it would be 12–19 cm, and the growth rate will begin to slow. The largest of this species ever recorded was 61 cm total length.  Distribution  Historically, the Sacramento perch was found throughout the Central Valley of California at elevations below 100 m. The Sacramento perch was very popular for recreation fishing. It was so abundant that this species was commonly used as a food fish eaten regularly. It inhabited sloughs, slow- moving rivers of the Pajaro and Salinas rivers, and lakes with emergent vegetation such as Clear Lake. This species has been eliminated from 90% of its natural habitat due to habitat destruction, egg predation by invasive fish species, and interspecific competition. Sacramento perch are quite rare now and found primarily in warm, turbid, and alkaline farm ponds, reservoirs, and recreational lakes that it has been introduced into. There are only two native populations of Sacramento perch that are still maintaining themselves and those reside in Clear Lake and Alameda Creek drainage as well as gravel pit ponds in the Calaveras Reservoir.  Diet  Aquatic insects are critical to the Sacramento perch's diet. This fish mostly feeds on chironomid midge larvae and pupae found on the bottom or in aquatic plants during winter months. During the summer months, this fish will mostly feed on plankton and other surface organisms. The Sacramento perch is an opportunistic species and will generally prey upon whatever is in abundance and have even been shown to eat mosquito larvae. Smaller perches mostly feed on small crustaceans and as they grow larger move on to aquatic insects and even other fish. This fish is most active at dawn and dusk, but can feed at any time of the day or night.  Breeding pattern  Spawning occurs from late March through early August, with peak times being late May and Early June when water temperatures are between 18-29 °C. The Sacramento perch reaches breeding age at 2–3 years old. The perch gather in shallow waters usually where there are rock piles, submerged roots, or other substrates nearby. The males each defend their own small territories and dig nests for the females to lay their eggs in. These nest areas are vigorously defended from other males by chasing, biting, and flaring opercular flaps at each other. Females spawn by releasing their eggs into the nest followed by the male quickly fertilizing them, but spawning can also occur side by side with sperm and egg being released at the same time. The male cares for the fertilized eggs for several days until they hatch, defending them against predators. When the eggs hatch they are tiny planktonic fish which rise to the surface to feed and grow for a couple weeks before settling down into the vegetation at the bottom.  Relationship with people  = Restoration efforts = The Sacramento perch is a very resilient species of fish with a wide range of diet. It is adapted to withstand low water clarity, high temperatures, even water with high salinity and alkalinity, which is why this native species has been chosen as the primary fish used in aquaponics systems. Aquaponics farms in California are incorporating the use of this endangered species in their systems for growing vegetables. This also serves as a restoration project for breeding Sacramento perch in order to release them back into native waters and add diversity to the wild population. With the rising temperatures in California, the mosquito population has been growing. A study shows that Sacramento perch bred in captivity prefer eating mosquito larvae. These results show that this species has the potential to be used to help control these growing populations in California wetlands. Although populations of Sacramento perch are not as numerous today as they were in the past, many programs today are focusing on reintroducing them across California waterways again. Potential habitats include Putah Creek and Clear Lake, where the Sacramento perch were abundant at one time but due to the construction of heavy infrastructure, could not persist. This species is now being reintroduced upstream of its native habitats in gravel pit ponds. However, due to limited genetic diversity, inbreeding has occurred in these isolated populations. To prevent this, reintroduction programs have been pulling only the most diverse fish from current populations and closely monitoring the diversity of the new populations using genetic markers. = Angling = The Sacramento perch is considered a game fish; the IGFA all-tackle world record for the species stands at 1.44 kg (3 lb 3 oz) caught from Crowley lake in California in 1995.

It is named after Irish physicist George Gabriel Stokes.Lakowicz, J. R. 1983. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Plenum Press, New York. .Guilbault, G.G. 1990. Practical Fluorescence, Second Edition, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York. . Sometimes Stokes shifts are given in wavelength units, but this is less meaningful than energy, wavenumber or frequency units because it depends on the absorption wavelength. For instance, a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 300 nm is larger in terms of energy than a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 600 nm. When a system (be it a molecule or atom) absorbs a photon, it gains energy and enters an excited state. One way for the system to relax is to emit a photon, thus losing its energy (another method would be the loss of energy as heat). When the emitted photon has less energy than the absorbed photon, this energy difference is the Stokes shift. The Stokes shift is primarily the result of two phenomena: vibrational relaxation or dissipation and solvent reorganization. A fluorophore is a dipole, surrounded by solvent molecules. When a fluorophore enters an excited state, its dipole moment changes, but surrounding solvent molecules cannot adjust so quickly. Only after vibrational relaxation do their dipole moments realign. Stokes fluorescence Stokes fluorescence is the emission of a longer-wavelength photon (lower frequency or energy) by a molecule that has absorbed a photon of shorter wavelength (higher frequency or energy).Banwell C.N. and McCash E.M. Fundamentals of Molecular Spectroscopy (4th ed., McGraw-Hill 1994) p.101 and p.113 Atkins P. and de Paula J. Physical Chemistry (8th ed., W.H. Freeman 2006) p.431 Both absorption and radiation (emission) of energy are distinctive for a particular molecular structure. If a material has a direct bandgap in the range of visible light, the light shining on it is absorbed, which excites electrons to a higher-energy state. The electrons remain in the excited state for about 10−8 seconds. This number varies over several orders of magnitude, depending on the sample, and is known as the fluorescence lifetime of the sample. After losing a small amount of energy through vibrational relaxation, the molecule returns to the ground state, and energy is emitted.  Anti-Stokes shift  If the emitted photon has more energy than the absorbed photon, the energy difference is called an anti-Stokes shift; this extra energy comes from dissipation of thermal phonons in a crystal lattice, cooling the crystal in the process. Yttrium oxysulfide doped with gadolinium oxysulfide is a common industrial anti-Stokes pigment, absorbing in the near-infrared and emitting in the visible region of the spectrum. Photon upconversion is another anti-Stokes process. An example of this later process is demonstrated by upconverting nanoparticles. It is more commonly observed in Raman spectroscopy, where it can be used to determine the temperature of a material.

She has been a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from September 1999 to May 2014, first representing the electorate of Melbourne North Province until 2006, and then as a Member for the Northern Victoria region. After making a name for herself as the Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), Broad moved into politics, contesting a safe Labor seat at the 1999 Victorian state election. She was immediately promoted into the ministry and served three years as Minister for Energy and Resources and Minister for Ports. After overseeing a range of changes in this area, she was promoted to Minister for Local Government and Housing after the 2002 election, but was unsuccessful in retaining a frontbench position following the 2006 Victorian State Election. Beginnings Broad was born in Perth, Western Australia, and studied commerce at the University of Western Australia. She graduated in 1978 and joined the Australian Labor Party the following year. After moving to Melbourne, Victoria in 1980, she worked as an administrator at the Labor Resource Centre--which specialised in industry and employment-related research--for several years. In 1986, she was appointed as a ministerial adviser, specialising in conservation for three years, before switching to education in 1989. In 1991, Broad was promoted to Head of the Premier's Office under Joan Kirner. This tenure was to be short-lived, as the Kirner government was defeated the following year, but she re-emerged as the party's Assistant National Secretary in 1993. While in this position, she had considerable influence over the creation of federal ALP policy, and campaigned for the rights of women in the party. To this end, Broad played a significant role in the 1994 introduction of the ALP's affirmative action scheme, aiming to have women pre-selected in 35 percent of winnable seats. She was also heavily involved in the creation in 1996 of Emily's List Australia, the support network for ALP women. In the months before the 1999 state election, Caroline Hogg, the sitting member for the very safe Labor Legislative Council seat of Melbourne North Province, announced that she would resign only halfway through her term. This meant that a by-election for her seat would be held alongside the regular election, and Broad won Labor pre-selection to fill the vacancy. First term (1999-2002) The election saw Broad easily defeat her Liberal rival, and also saw the ALP, under new leader Steve Bracks, regain power after seven years. The widely unexpected victory meant that several first-time MPs were promoted to the ministry, and Broad was appointed Minister for Energy and Resources, Minister for Ports, and Minister Assisting the Minister for State and Regional Development. In this new portfolio, Broad was forced to deal with a number of major issues, particularly those surrounding the state's power supplies and natural resources. One of Broad's first challenges as an incoming minister was to deal with the fate of the Snowy River, which had diminished to a trickle as a result of being dammed for various purposes. Though it had been an environmental issue for many years, it became of particular concern to the Bracks government, as the issue was central to the support of independent Craig Ingram, who they relied on to retain a majority in parliament. It fell to Broad, as the relevant minister, to handle negotiations on the issue with both the federal and New South Wales state governments. Despite the involvement of a number of conflicting interests, a major agreement was reached between the three parties in October 2000. This saw A$160 million put towards regenerating the river, with the intention of increasing its water flow to 28% of its original capacity. Broad was also faced with the problem of balancing the need to promote environmentally sustainable sources of energy against the need to maintain a cheap and reliable electricity supply across the state. She publicly supported the Kyoto Protocol, and oversaw the introduction of the Victorian Greenhouse Strategy, which introduced a range of reforms, such as mandated five-star efficiency standards for new houses, and which, according to the government, would save \\"about five to eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year\\". Despite this, Broad oversaw the tendering process for the first new brown coal licenses in Victoria in almost a century. This decision allowed for the construction of coal-to-oil facilities capable of emitting several million tons of additional carbon dioxide each year, with associated conditions requiring that they introduce more efficient means of production in order to minimise the environmental costs. However, the tenders led to substantial criticism from several environmental groups, such as Environment Victoria, who argued that it could \\"wipe out all of the savings\\" achieved in the Greenhouse Strategy, and pushed for a complete ban on new brown coal facilities. As the minister responsible for energy, Broad was entrusted with the task of maintaining stable electricity supplies across the state. In this way, she helped to establish the National Electricity Market Ministers Forum, a high- level organisation with the mission of expediting reform in the area. She went on to serve as its founding chair during 2001. In addition, she oversaw the instigation of two major changes to the state's electricity industry. This involved the establishment of the position of the Essential Services Commissioner, which created a regulatory body that could deal with individual complaints, and the introduction of choice in dealing with retail electricity companies. This encouraged the various electricity companies to compete for customers, replacing a system where each had operated with a monopoly in certain regions. However, Broad was also to face serious difficulties associated with industrial relations in this area, most notably when she was forced to play a mediating role in a long-running and much-publicised dispute between Yallourn Energy, one of the state's major power suppliers, and their workforce. Second term (2002-2006) Due to being elected in a by-election, Broad had to face re-election at the November 2002 state election, but was easily re-elected. After the election, Premier Bracks oversaw a major reshuffle of the ministry, and Broad was moved to the higher-profile portfolios of Local Government and Housing, at the expense of Bob Cameron, who was demoted to Agriculture. These new portfolios left Broad responsible for the issues of public housing, homelessness and local councils in general, as well as overseeing the November 2004 council elections. Broad was responsible for implementing a controversial $70 million proposal to encourage welfare groups and councils to form not-for-profit housing associations as a means of dealing with public housing. Though Broad had not been involved in the plan's conception, as it had been devised by her predecessor as Minister for Housing, she had to deal with the mixed reactions the proposal received. While it was commended by some, such as the Salvation Army, others, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence worried that it gave them little protection if an association ran into financial trouble. Under Broad, several public housing estates underwent major renovations - most notably in the notorious Kensington area of Melbourne and in Wendouree West, Ballarat. A number of smaller residential facilities were also built, mostly in regional areas. However, she came under fire from several organisations representing public tenants for agreeing to raise rent charges across the state, as well as to sell off significant open space adjacent to an estate in Port Melbourne. Broad's tenure as Minister for Housing also included the unveiling of the Youth Homeless Action Plan. This both attempted to determine major causes of homelessness and provided a number of potential means for dealing with the problem, such as family mediation and further attempts at education. It resulted in an influx of $8.8 million into relevant programs, as well as a $298,000 grant to the Melbourne Citymission. In addition, she oversaw the introduction of a $200,000 plan to prevent homeless in the regional area of Loddon Mallee, and opened a series of small accommodation centres for the homeless in both Melbourne and a number of regional centres. In comparison to the many developments under the housing portfolio, Broad's term as Minister for Local Government has been comparatively uneventful. As the responsible minister for the November 2004 council elections, she came under some fire for not intervening in the City of Melbourne lord mayoral race, which had over 100 candidates vying for two positions, resulting in widespread allegations of dummy candidates. However, she claimed some vindication when the result was widely uncontroversial, seeing the re-election of incumbent Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So. Third term (2006-2014) Broad wished to continue as a Minister following Labor's victory on 25 November 2006, however, she did not have enough votes within the Labor Caucus to secure a frontbench position. She went to the backbench in the odd position of never having been a backbencher in her seven-year parliamentary career. Broad introduced the Abortion Law Reform Bill into the Parliament in 2008, which was passed overwhelmingly on a conscience vote by Members of all parties.Ainsley Symons (2014), \\"Anti-Abortion Campaigning and the Political Process,\\" Recorder (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch) No, 279, March, p.3 Broad did not contest the 2014 election. Personal life Broad is an avid football supporter, and is a member of the Collingwood Football Club. She supports voluntary euthanasia, being a member of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Victoria, and is a member of several community organisations, such as the Australian Conservation Foundation.

Background In the summer of 1991, Dave Grohl went into WGNS Studios and recorded four songs, playing all the instruments himself. The recording was combined with six songs from a previous Upland Studios session recorded in late 1990. Although both sessions occurred after joining Nirvana, Grohl unobtrusively acknowledged their existence. A tape of the songs, given to Simple Machines co-founder Jenny Toomey by Grohl, immediately became a candidate for the labels Tool Cassette Series.Simple Machines: Tool Cassette Series The 1990 sessions emerged as Grohl, then the drummer of Scream, requested his producer friend Barrett Jones to record songs in his home 8-track tape recorder. Upon accepting Simple Machines' request for a demo tape, Grohl decided to hide his identity under the pseudonym Late!, \\"because I’m an idiot and I thought it would be funny to say to everybody, 'Sorry, we’re Late!’\\".Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters  Extended interview  Lollapalooza 2011 The Tool Cassette Series started around 1991 as an experiment, and as a way of keeping music \\"in print\\" on an as-needed basis without having to finance vinyl or CD pressings, since Simple Machines dubbed the cassettes as the orders came in. With multiple cassette decks and a lot of volunteer help, this was a manageable project for the label. Shortly after Nirvana released Nevermind in the fall of 1991, its unexpected success was large enough that Pocketwatch eventually became noticed. It gained more attention when the Foo Fighters' early material was released in 1995. Some of the songs appeared on subsequent releases, creating even higher demand for the cassette. Suddenly, Pocketwatch was being mentioned frequently in interviews, and the label became flooded with orders. Grohl claimed that the big number of requests led Toomey to \\"literally dub them on a double cassette deck in her bedroom.\\" With minimal help and deteriorating master cassettes, Simple Machines got in touch with Grohl about releasing the Late! album as a CD, to keep up with demand. However, Grohl preferred to keep it as a cassette only release, which the label honored. The musician explained later that he refused to do a CD release because \\"it was never intended to be a big thing\\", but Grohl also joked, regarding Pocketwatchs current status as a highly sought collectible, that he \\"wanted to drive up the price of cassettes to $3,000\\". When the two master cassettes for Pocketwatch came to the end of their useful lives, and with some of the other artists masters in the same condition, Simple Machines decided to discontinue the Tool Cassette Series from their mailorder, putting the over half-decade experiment to an end. Other releases As cassettes became a less popular format, and with no official CD release in sight, Pocketwatch fell victim to countless bootleg CD releases, ranging from a single song to the entire album. \\"Color Pictures of a Marigold\\" appeared on the rarities collection Outcesticide III: The Final Solution, part of a popular Nirvana bootleg series on Blue Moon Records. The song also appeared on Fighting the \\"N\\" Factor, an unauthorized Foo Fighters release that included the track as a bonus, with Nirvana's Saturday Night Live rehearsals and Tunnel TV Show performance. The Late! album appeared in its entirety on the Foo Fighters' bootleg album Pocketwatch Demos on Primadonna, a bootleg label active throughout the 1990s, based in Milano, Italy. Songs from the Late! album made appearances on official releases as well. Prior to the Pocketwatch offering, \\"Petrol CB\\" was included on the Neapolitan Metropolitan 7\\" vinyl box set compilation released by Simple Machines in 1992, under the title \\"There's That Song\\" and also featured tracks from Breadwinner, Burma Jam, Bratmobile, and Lilys, among others.LiveNirvana.com - Bootography The only song officially released on CD was a remixed version of \\"Just Another Story About Skeeter Thompson\\", included on The Melvins' 1992 King Buzzo EP, retitled \\"Skeeter\\". Although constantly coupled with Nirvana and Foo Fighters collections, Late! should be considered its own separate project.Discogs.com This would become complicated, taking into account that both bands would go on to release new versions of songs from the Pocketwatch album. \\"Color Pictures of a Marigold\\" was re-recorded with Krist Novoselic on bass in 1993 and released as a b-side of Nirvana's \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" single, simply titled \\"Marigold\\". This version would also appear on the 2004 With the Lights Out box set. Another version of the song appeared on the Foo Fighters live album, Skin and Bones. \\"Winnebago\\" was re-recorded during the sessions for the first Foo Fighters album in 1994. Despite not making the album, it appeared as a b-side on the Foo Fighters first release, the \\"Exhausted\\" vinyl single, and later on the Australian bonus disc to Foo Fighters and as a b-side to the singles \\"This Is a Call\\" and \\"Big Me\\". A new version of \\"Friend of a Friend\\" was first released on a free NME covermount cassette, then the acoustic side of the Foo Fighters' 2005 double album In Your Honor and later the following year on Skin and Bones.

It is similar to other forms of tinea. Signs and symptoms It may have a variety of appearances; most easily identifiable are the enlarging raised red rings with a central area of clearing (ringworm). The same appearances of ringworm may also occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), beard area (tinea barbae) or the groin (tinea cruris, known as jock itch or dhobi itch). Other classic features of tinea corporis include: * Itching occurs on infected area. * The edge of the rash appears elevated and is scaly to touch. * Sometimes the skin surrounding the rash may be dry and flaky. * Almost invariably, there will be hair loss in areas of the infection. Causes Tinea corporis is caused by a tiny fungus known as dermatophyte. These tiny organisms normally live on the superficial skin surface, and when the opportunity is right, they can induce a rash or infection. The disease can also be acquired by person-to-person transfer usually via direct skin contact with an infected individual. Animal-to-human transmission is also common. Ringworm commonly occurs on pets (dogs, cats) and the fungus can be acquired while petting or grooming an animal. Ringworm can also be acquired from other animals such as horses, pigs, ferrets and cows. The fungus can also be spread by touching inanimate objects like personal care products, bed linen, combs, athletic gear, or hair brushes contaminated by an affected person. Individuals at high risk of acquiring ringworm include those who: * Live in crowded, humid conditions. * Sweat excessively, as sweat can produce a humid wet environment where the pathogenic fungi can thrive. This is most common in the armpits, groin creases and skin folds of the abdomen. * Participate in close contact sports like soccer, rugby, or wrestling. * Wear tight, constrictive clothing with poor aeration. * Have a weakened immune system (e.g., those infected with HIV or taking immunosuppressive drugs). Diagnosis Superficial scrapes of skin examined underneath a microscope may reveal the presence of a fungus. This is done by utilizing a diagnostic method called KOH Test, wherein the skin scrapings are placed on a slide and immersed on a dropful of potassium hydroxide solution to dissolve the keratin on the skin scrappings thus leaving fungal elements such as hyphae, septate or yeast cells viewable. If the skin scrapings are negative and a fungus is still suspected, the scrapings are sent for culture. Because the fungus grows slowly, the culture results do take several days to become positive. Prevention Because fungi prefer warm, moist environments, preventing ringworm involves keeping skin dry and avoiding contact with infectious material. Basic prevention measures include: * Washing hands after handling animals, soil, and plants. * Avoiding touching characteristic lesions on other people. * Wearing loose-fitting clothing. * Practicing good hygiene when participating in sports that involve physical contact with other people. Treatment Most cases are treated by application of topical antifungal creams to the skin, but in extensive or difficult to treat cases, systemic treatment with oral medication may be required. The over-the-counter options include tolnaftate, as well as ketoconazole (available as Nizoral shampoo that can be applied topically). Among the available prescription drugs, the evidence is best for terbinafine and naftifine, but other agents may also work. Topical antifungals are applied to the lesion twice a day for at least 3 weeks. The lesion usually resolves within 2 weeks, but therapy should be continued for another week to ensure the fungus is completely eradicated. If there are several ringworm lesions, the lesions are extensive, complications such as secondary infection exist, or the patient is immunocompromised, oral antifungal medications can be used. Oral medications are taken once a day for 7 days and result in higher clinical cure rates. The antifungal medications most commonly used are itraconazole, terbinafine, and ketoconazole. The benefits of the use of topical steroids in addition to an antifungal is unclear. There might be a greater cure rate but no guidelines currently recommend its addition. The effect of Whitfield's ointment is also unclear. Prognosis Tinea corporis is moderately contagious and can affect both humans and pets. If a person acquires it, the proper measures must be taken to prevent it from spreading. Young children in particular should be educated about the infection and preventive measures: avoid skin to skin contact with infected persons and animals, wear clothing that allows the skin to breathe, and don't share towels, clothing or combs with others. If pets are kept in the household or premises, they should get the animal checked for tinea, especially if hair loss in patches is noticed or the pet is scratching excessively. The majority of people who have acquired tinea know how uncomfortable the infection can be. However, the fungus can easily be treated and prevented in individuals with a healthy immune system. Society and culture When the dermatophytic infection presents in wrestlers, with skin lesions typically found on the head, neck, and arms it is sometimes called tinea corporis gladiatorum.

Its symbolism allows the treatment of sums, products, ratios and general functions of random variables, as well as dealing with operations such as finding the probability distributions and the expectations (or expected values), variances and covariances of such combinations. In principle, the elementary algebra of random variables is equivalent to that of conventional non-random (or deterministic) variables. However, the changes occurring on the probability distribution of a random variable obtained after performing algebraic operations are not straightfoward. Therefore, the behavior of the different operators of the probability distribution, such as expected values, variances, covariances, and moments, may be different from that observed for the random variable using symbolic algebra. It is possible to identify some key rules for each of those operators, resulting in different types of algebra for random variables, apart from the elementary symbolic algebra: Expectation algebra, Variance algebra, Covariance algebra, Moment algebra, etc.  Elementary symbolic algebra of random variables  Considering two random variables X and Y, the following algebraic operations are possible: * Addition: Z=X+Y=Y+X * Subtraction: Z=X-Y=-Y+X * Multiplication: Z=XY=YX * Division: Z=X / Y=X cdot (1/Y)=(1/Y) cdot X * Exponentiation: Z=X^Y=e^{Yln(X)} In all cases, the variable Z resulting from each operation is also a random variable. All commutative and associative properties of conventional algebraic operations are also valid for random variables. If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value, all the previous properties remain valid.  Expectation algebra for random variables  The expected value E of the random variable Z resulting from an algebraic operation between two random variables can be calculated using the following set of rules: * Addition: E[Z]=E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]=E[Y]+E[X] * Subtraction: E[Z]=E[X-Y]=E[X]-E[Y]=-E[Y]+E[X] * Multiplication: E[Z]=E[XY]=E[YX]. Particularly, if Xand Yare independent from each other, then: E[XY]=E[X] cdot E[Y]=E[Y] cdot E[X]. * Division: E[Z]=E[X/Y]=E[X cdot (1/Y)]=E[(1/Y) cdot X]. Particularly, if Xand Yare independent from each other, then: E[X/Y]=E[X] cdot E[1/Y]=E[1/Y] cdot E[X]. * Exponentiation: E[Z]=E[X^Y]=E[e^{Yln(X)}] If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value (k), the previous properties remain valid considering that P[X = k] = 1 and, therefore, E[X]=k. If Z is defined as a general non-linear algebraic function f of a random variable X, then: E[Z]=E[f(X)] eq f(E[X]) Some examples of this property include: * E[X^2] eq E[X]^2 * E[1/X] eq 1/E[X] * E[e^X] eq e^{E[X]} * E[ln(X)] eq ln(E[X]) The exact value of the expectation of the non-linear function will depend on the particular probability distribution of the random variable X.  Variance algebra for random variables  The variance Var of the random variable Z resulting from an algebraic operation between random variables can be calculated using the following set of rules: * Addition: Var[Z]=Var[X+Y]=Var[X]+2Cov[X,Y]+Var[Y]. Particularly, if Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Var[X+Y]=Var[X]+Var[Y]. * Subtraction: Var[Z]=Var[X-Y]=Var[X]-2Cov[X,Y]+Var[Y]. Particularly, if Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Var[X-Y]=Var[X]+Var[Y]. That is, for independent random variables the variance is the same for additions and subtractions: Var[X+Y]=Var[X-Y]=Var[Y-X]=Var[-X-Y] * Multiplication: Var[Z]=Var[XY]=Var[YX]. Particularly, if Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Var[XY]=E[X^2]cdot E[Y^2]-(E[X]cdot E[Y])^2 =Var[X] cdot Var[Y]+Var[X] cdot (E[Y])^2+Var[Y] cdot (E[X])^2. * Division: Var[Z]=Var[X/Y]=Var[X cdot (1/Y)]=Var[(1/Y) cdot X]. Particularly, if Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Var[X/Y]=E[X^2]cdot E[1/Y^2]-(E[X]cdot E[1/Y])^2 =Var[X] cdot Var[1/Y]+Var[X] cdot (E[1/Y])^2+Var[1/Y] cdot (E[X])^2. * Exponentiation: Var[Z]=Var[X^Y]=Var[e^{Yln(X)}] where Cov[X,Y]=Cov[Y,X] represents the covariance operator between random variables X and Y. The variance of a random variable can also be expressed directly in terms of the covariance or in terms of the expected value: Var[X] = Cov(X,X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value (k), the previous properties remain valid considering that P[X = k] = 1 and E[X]=k, Var[X]=0 and Cov[Y,k]=0. Special cases are the addition and multiplication of a random variable with a deterministic variable or a constant, where: * Var[X+Y]=Var[Y] * Var[kY]=k^2 Var[Y] If Z is defined as a general non-linear algebraic function f of a random variable X, then: Var[Z]=Var[f(X)] eq f(Var[X]) The exact value of the variance of the non- linear function will depend on the particular probability distribution of the random variable X.  Covariance algebra for random variables  The covariance ( Cov) between the random variable Z resulting from an algebraic operation and the random variable X can be calculated using the following set of rules: *Addition: Cov[Z,X]=Cov[X+Y,X]=Var[X]+Cov[X,Y]. If Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Cov[X+Y,X]=Var[X]. *Subtraction: Cov[Z,X]=Cov[X-Y,X]=Var[X]-Cov[X,Y]. If Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Cov[X-Y,X]=Var[X]. *Multiplication: Cov[Z,X]=Cov[XY,X]=E[X^2Y]-E[XY]E[X]. If Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Cov[XY,X]=Var[X] cdot E[Y]. *Division (covariance with respect to the numerator): Cov[Z,X]=Cov[X/Y,X]=E[X^2/Y]-E[X/Y]E[X]. If Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Cov[X/Y,X]=Var[X] cdot E[1/Y]. *Division (covariance with respect to the denominator): Cov[Z,X]=Cov[Y/X,X]=E[Y]-E[Y/X]E[X]. If Xand Yare independent from each other, then: Cov[Y/X,X]=E[Y] cdot (1-E[X] cdot E[1/X]). *Exponentiation (covariance with respect to the base): Cov[Z,X]=Cov[X^Y,X]=E[X^{Y+1}]-E[X^Y]E[X]. *Exponentiation (covariance with respect to the power): Cov[Z,X]=Cov[Y^X,X]=E[XY^X]-E[Y^X]E[X]. The covariance of a random variable can also be expressed directly in terms of the expected value: Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value ( k), the previous properties remain valid considering that E[k]=k, Var[k]=0and Cov[X,k]=0. If Zis defined as a general non-linear algebraic function fof a random variable X, then: Cov[Z,X]=Cov[f(X),X]=E[Xf(X)]-E[f(X)]E[X] The exact value of the variance of the non-linear function will depend on the particular probability distribution of the random variable X.  Approximations by Taylor series expansions of moments  If the moments of a certain random variable Xare known (or can be determined by integration if the probability density function is known), then it is possible to approximate the expected value of any general non-linear function f(X)as a Taylor series expansion of the moments, as follows: f(X)= displaystyle sum_{n=0}^infty displaystyle frac{1}{n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}(X-mu)^n, where mu=E[X]is the mean value of X. E[f(X)]=Ebiggl(textstyle sum_{n=0}^infty displaystyle {1 over n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}(X-mu)^nbiggr)=displaystyle sum_{n=0}^infty displaystyle {1 over n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}E[(X-mu)^n]=textstyle sum_{n=0}^infty displaystyle frac{1}{n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}mu_n(X), where mu_n(X)=E[(X-mu)^n]is the n-th moment of X about its mean. Note that by their definition, mu_0(X)=1 and mu_1(X)=0. The first order term always vanishes but was kept to obtain a closed form expression. Then, E[f(X)]approx textstyle sum_{n=0}^{n_{max}} displaystyle {1 over n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}mu_n(X) , where the Taylor expansion is truncated after the n_{max} -th moment. Particularly for functions of normal random variables, it is possible to obtain a Taylor expansion in terms of the standard normal distribution: f(X)= textstyle sum_{n=0}^infty displaystyle {sigma^n over n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}mu_n(Z), where Xsim N(mu,sigma ^2)is a normal random variable, and Zsim N(0,1)is the standard normal distribution. Thus, E[f(X)]approx textstyle sum_{n=0}^{n_{max}} displaystyle {sigma ^n over n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}mu_n(Z) , where the moments of the standard normal distribution are given by: mu_n(Z)= begin{cases} prod_{i=1}^{n/2}(2i-1), & text{if }ntext{ is even}  0, & text{if }ntext{ is odd} end{cases} Similarly for normal random variables, it is also possible to approximate the variance of the non-linear function as a Taylor series expansion as: Var[f(X)]approx textstyle sum_{n=1}^{n_{max}} displaystyle biggl({sigma^n over n!}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}biggr)^2Var[Z^n]+textstyle sum_{n=1}^{n_{max}} displaystyle textstyle sum_{m eq n} displaystyle {sigma^{n+m} over {n!m!}}biggl({d^nf over dX^n}biggr)_{X=mu}biggl({d^mf over dX^m}biggr)_{X=mu}Cov[Z^n,Z^m], where Var[Z^n]= begin{cases} prod_{i=1}^{n}(2i-1) -prod_{i=1}^{n/2}(2i-1)^2, & text{if }ntext{ is even}  prod_{i=1}^{n}(2i-1), & text{if }ntext{ is odd} end{cases}, and Cov[Z^n,Z^m]= begin{cases} prod_{i=1}^{(n+m)/2}(2i-1) -prod_{i=1}^{n/2}(2i-1)prod_{j=1}^{m/2}(2j-1), & text{if }ntext{ and }m text{ are even}  prod_{i=1}^{(n+m)/2}(2i-1), & text{if }ntext{ and }mtext{ are odd}  0, & text{otherwise} end{cases} Algebra of complex random variables In the algebraic axiomatization of probability theory, the primary concept is not that of probability of an event, but rather that of a random variable. Probability distributions are determined by assigning an expectation to each random variable. The measurable space and the probability measure arise from the random variables and expectations by means of well- known representation theorems of analysis. One of the important features of the algebraic approach is that apparently infinite-dimensional probability distributions are not harder to formalize than finite-dimensional ones. Random variables are assumed to have the following properties: # complex constants are possible realizations of a random variable; # the sum of two random variables is a random variable; # the product of two random variables is a random variable; # addition and multiplication of random variables are both commutative; and # there is a notion of conjugation of random variables, satisfying and for all random variables and coinciding with complex conjugation if is a constant. This means that random variables form complex commutative *-algebras. If then the random variable is called \\"real\\". An expectation on an algebra of random variables is a normalized, positive linear functional. What this means is that # where is a constant; # for all random variables ; # for all random variables and ; and # if is a constant. One may generalize this setup, allowing the algebra to be noncommutative. This leads to other areas of noncommutative probability such as quantum probability, random matrix theory, and free probability.

The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) is an experiment in astroparticle physics to search for axions originating from the Sun. The experiment, sited at CERN in Switzerland, came online in 2002 with the first data-taking run starting in May 2003. The successful detection of solar axions would constitute a major discovery in particle physics, and would also open up a brand new window on the astrophysics of the solar core. Theory of operation If the axions exist, they may be produced in the Sun's core when X-rays scatter off electrons and protons in the presence of strong electric fields. The experimental setup is built around a 9.26 m long decommissioned test magnet for the LHC capable of producing a field of up to . This strong magnetic field is expected to convert solar axions back into X-rays for subsequent detection by X-ray detectors. The telescope observes the Sun for about 1.5 hours at sunrise and another 1.5 hours at sunset each day. The remaining 21 hours, with the instrument pointing away from the Sun, are spent measuring background axion levels. CAST began operation in 2003 searching for axions up to . In 2005, Helium-4 was added to the magnet, extending sensitivity to masses up to 0.39 eV, then Helium-3 was used during 2008–2011 for masses up to 1.15 eV. CAST then ran with vacuum again searching for axions below 0.02 eV. As of 2014, CAST has not turned up definitive evidence for solar axions. It has considerably narrowed down the range of parameters where these elusive particles may exist. CAST has set significant limits on axion coupling to electrons and photons. A 2017 paper using data from the 2013–2015 run reported a new best limit on axion-photon coupling of 0.66×10 / GeV. Built upon the experience of CAST, a much larger, new- generation, axion helioscope, the International Axion Observatory (IAXO), has been proposed and is now under preparation.

The weapon is used by running the end of the spar into the enemy ship. Spar torpedoes were often equipped with a barbed spear at the end, so it would stick to wooden hulls. A fuse could then be used to detonate it. Invention Robert Fulton had written about submarine (i.e., subsurface) marine torpedoes in 1810,Fulton, Robert, Torpedo War, and Submarine Explosions. William Elliot (1810) and experiments were conducted using spar torpedoes that year.Experiments on the practical use of the torpedo, communicated to the House of Representatives, February 14, 1811. 11th Congress, 3d session, illus.

E. C. Singer, a private engineer who worked on secret projects for the benefit of the Confederate States of America, constructed a spar torpedo during the American Civil War. His torpedo was detonated by means of a trigger mechanism adapted from a rifle lock (see flintlock mechanism for a similar device). The spring-loaded trigger was detonated by means of a long cord attached to the attacking vessel. The attacking vessel rammed its target, embedding the barbed torpedo in its hull, then backed off. When the attacker reached the limit of the trigger cord, the torpedo was detonated. Use Results of a French test of a spar torpedo in 1877. Perhaps the most famous use of spar torpedoes during the U.S. Civil War was by the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley, which managed to sink the Union screw sloop USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, although the Hunley was lost. Spar torpedoes were also used by the David-class of semi-submersible attack boats. In April 1864, Confederate torpedo boat CSS Squib employed a spar torpedo against USS Minnesota.CSS Squib. Naval History and Heritage Command.St. John Erickson, Mark, \\"A daring Confederate night attack on the Union fleet off Newport News Point\\", Daily Press, April 4, 2014. At night on October 27–28, 1864, Lieutenant Cushing employed a spar torpedo to sink the Confederate ironclad ram CSS Albemarle. The sinking of the Albemarle was the Union navy's only successful sinking of a Confederate vessel by torpedo. Lieutenant Cushing employed a spar torpedo designed by John Lay. The semi- submersible 1864 Union craft USS Spuyten Duyvil employed a spar torpedo, but not with a barbed attachment to the target. Owing to an innovative directable and extensible spar, this craft could release a slightly buoyant mine underneath the target, which would be exploded by the means described above. (This craft was not employed against Confederate targets, but was used to clear wreckage from rivers.) Spar torpedoes were also used on small wooden launches in the late 19th century, although they were not very useful weapons. The locomotive torpedo (the contemporary term for the modern self-propelled torpedo) replaced the spar torpedo as a weapon for submarines and small boats in the 1870s.

He was one of the pioneers of the style of the concertato motet. Biography Ignazio Donati was born in Casalmaggiore (now in the Province of Cremona). Little is known about his earliest years, but he must have had a thorough early musical training, and his succession of posts at various cathedrals in Italian towns is well documented: he served successively at Urbino, Pesaro, Fano, Ferrara, Casalmaggiore, Novara, and Lodi, eventually acquiring the prestigious post at Milan Cathedral in 1629, which he kept with one short break until his death. Donati wrote \\"sacred concertos\\", motets, masses and psalm settings. Most of Donati's music is sacred, and his style tends towards the cheerful, the light, and the practical. He wrote motets using the new concertato style pioneered by the composers of the Venetian School, though he was not associated with Venice himself. Most of his music is for two to five voices with instrumental accompaniment including basso continuo, and some of his works--for example a book of psalm settings--exist in several settings for different types of performance, with different instrumental and vocal forces. Ignazio Donati wrote the Sacri concentus and published it in Venice in 1612; here he defined the \\"cantar lontano\\" vocal practice. In some of his music he went even farther, and suggested multiple performance ideas--from singing only a very few parts, to using multiple choruses with instrumental doubling, based on the resources of the performing ensemble and the type of effect required by the performance occasion. This kind of practical advice is rarely found in the writings accompanying the music of the Venetian school composers, who had massive, virtuoso, well-paid ensembles at their disposal, but it would have been essential to the musical establishments at the small provincial towns in which Donati worked. In addition to his concertato motets and other mixed instrumental-vocal music, he wrote some relatively conservative masses, which, however, are not in the polyphonic Palestrina style but find a middle-ground between the stile antico and the more modern harmonic practice.

Only a handful of top officials in Berlin and St. Petersburg knew of its existence. The treaty played a critical role in Bismarck's extremely complex and ingenious network of alliances and agreements which aimed to keep the peace in Europe and to maintain Germany's economic, diplomatic, and political dominance. The treaty provided that each party would remain neutral if the other became involved in a war with a third great power, though this would not apply if Germany attacked France or if Russia attacked Austria. Germany paid for Russian friendship by agreeing to the Russian sphere of influence in Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (part of present-day southern Bulgaria) and by agreeing to support Russian action to keep the Black Sea as its own preserve. When Germany declined to renew the treaty in 1890, the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1891/1892 to 1917 rapidly began to take shape. The Reinsurance Treaty originated after the German-Austrian-Russian Dreikaiserbund (League of the Three Emperors) lapsed in 1887. The League ended because of competition between Austria- Hungary and Russia (Emperor Alexander III) for spheres of influence in the Balkans. In early 1887 a Russian diplomat went to Berlin to propose a treaty whereby Russia would be a friendly neutral in case of a war between Germany and France, and in return Germany would recognize Russian dominance in Bulgaria, and promise friendly neutrality if Russia were to seize the Straits from the Ottoman Empire. Bismarck strongly supported the idea, but Tsar Alexander rejected the plan until his Foreign Minister Nikolay Girs convinced him that - in the absence of French friendship - this was the best that Russia could do. Bismarck refused Russia's request that Germany stay neutral if Russia went to war with Austria, explaining that Berlin had an ironclad Triple Alliance with Vienna.A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848-1918. (1954) pp 316-19. Bismarck had a long-term policy of preserving the peace in Europe, and the growing competition between Russia and Austria–Hungary for dominance over the Balkans threatened that peace. Bismarck felt that an agreement with Russia was essential to prevent a Russian alliance with France - he always had the policy of keeping France isolated diplomatically in order to avoid a two-front war with Germany fighting both France and Russia. Bismarck risked the expansion of the Russian sphere of influence toward the Mediterranean and diplomatic tensions with Vienna. The treaty signed by Bismarck and the Russian Foreign Minister Nikolay Girs had two parts: # Germany and Russia each agreed to observe benevolent neutrality should the other become involved in a war with a third country. If Germany attacked France or if Russia attacked Austria-Hungary, this provision would not apply. In those cases, the distinguished bilateral alliances could come into effect. The Reinsurance Treaty only applied when France or Austria- Hungary were the aggressors. # In the most secret completion protocol, Germany would declare neutrality in the event of a Russian intervention against the Ottoman control of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. As part of Bismarck's system of \\"periphery diversion\\", the treaty was highly dependent on his prestige. When Kaiser Wilhelm II removed Bismarck from office in 1890, Russia asked for a renewal of the treaty; Germany refused. Bismarck's successor, Leo von Caprivi felt no need to mollify Russia. Germany's foreign-policy establishment was unanimous in rejecting a renewal, because it contradicted so many other German positions with regard to Austria, Britain, Romania, and Italy. For example, the Reinsurance Treaty contradicted the secret treaty of 1883 in which Germany and Austria promised to protect Romania. Russia knew nothing of that treaty.Norman Rich, Great power diplomacy, 1814-1914 (1992) p 230, 252 Kaiser Wilhelm II, still highly influential in foreign policy, believed his personal friendship with Tsar Alexander III would suffice to ensure further genial diplomatic ties. His higher priority was building better relationships with Great Britain. Anglo-Russian relations had long been strained by Russia's quest to take control of the Straits linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. London feared that Russian expansion to its south would threaten British colonial interests in the Middle East. France, desperate for an ally, offered financial help to rebuild the Russian economy and successfully developed the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894, ending French isolation. The dismissal of Bismarck, the erratic temper of Wilhelm II and the uncertain policy of the men who succeeded Bismarck were joint causes of a growing international instability. In 1896 Bismarck, in retirement, caused a huge sensation when he revealed the existence of the treaty to a German newspaper. He blamed his successor (Count Caprivi) as responsible for the non- renewal in 1890. Bismarck said the failure of the treaty made it possible for France and Russia to draw together. Jonathan Steinberg, Bismarck: a life (2012). pp 460-62. Historians agree that the Reinsurance Treaty itself was not of great importance, but that the failure to renew it marked the decisive turning point of Russia's movement away from Germany and toward France, and thus was one of the multiple causes of the First World War which broke out in 1914.Rich, pp. 260-62, 317, 371.

Rohmer was the last of the post-World War II French New Wave directors to become established. He edited the influential film journal Cahiers du cinéma from 1957 to 1963, while most of his colleagues—among them Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut—were making the transition from critics to filmmakers and gaining international attention. Rohmer gained international acclaim around 1969 when his film My Night at Maud's was nominated at the Academy Awards. He won the San Sebastián International Film Festival with Claire's Knee in 1971 and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for The Green Ray in 1986. Rohmer went on to receive the Venice Film Festival's Career Golden Lion in 2001. After Rohmer's death in 2010, his obituary in The Daily Telegraph described him as \\"the most durable filmmaker of the French New Wave\\", outlasting his peers and \\"still making movies the public wanted to see\\" late in his career.

The New Wave. New York: Oxford University Press. 1976. p. 286. He fashioned his pseudonym from the names of two famous artists: actor and director Erich von Stroheim and writer Sax Rohmer, author of the Fu Manchu series. Rohmer was educated in Paris and received an advanced degree in history. He also studied literature, philosophy, and theology as a student.John Wakeman, World Film Directors, Volume 2, 1945-1985. New York: H. W. Wilson, 1988. pp. 919-928. Career as a journalist Rohmer first worked as a teacher in Clermont-Ferrand. In the mid-1940s he quit his teaching job and moved to Paris, where he worked as a freelance journalist. In 1946 he published a novel, Elisabeth (AKA Les Vacances) under the pen name Gilbert Cordier. In about 1949, while living in Paris, Rohmer first began to attend screenings at Henri Langlois's Cinémathèque Française, where he first met and befriended Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and other members of the French New Wave. Rohmer had never been very interested in film, preferring literature, but soon became an intense lover of films and switched from journalism to film criticism. He wrote film reviews for such publications as Révue du Cinéma, Arts, Temps Modernes and La Parisienne. In 1950, he co-founded the film magazine La Gazette du Cinéma with Rivette and Godard, but it was short-lived. In 1951 Rohmer joined the staff of André Bazin's newly founded film magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, of which he became the editor in 1956. There, Rohmer established himself as a critic with a distinctive voice; fellow Cahiers contributor and French New Wave filmmaker Luc Moullet later remarked that, unlike the more aggressive and personal writings of younger critics like Truffaut and Godard, Rohmer favored a rhetorical style that made extensive use of questions and rarely used the first person singular.Luc Moullet. The Mask and the Role of God. Mubi Notebook. Rohmer was known as more politically conservative than most of the Cahiers staff, and his opinions were highly influential on the magazine's direction while he was editor. Rohmer first published articles under his real name but began using \\"Éric Rohmer\\" in 1955 so that his family would not find out that he was involved in the film world, as they would have disapproved. Rohmer's best-known article was \\"Le Celluloid et le marbre\\" (\\"Celluloid and Marble\\", 1955), which examines the relationship between film and other arts. In the article, Rohmer writes that in an age of cultural self-consciousness, film is \\"the last refuge of poetry\\" and the only contemporary art form from which metaphor can still spring naturally and spontaneously. In 1957 Rohmer and Claude Chabrol wrote Hitchcock (Paris: Éditions Universitaires, 1957), the earliest book-length study of Alfred Hitchcock. It focuses on Hitchcock's Catholic background and has been called \\"one of the most influential film books since the Second World War, casting new light on a filmmaker hitherto considered a mere entertainer\\". Hitchcock helped establish the auteur theory as a critical method and contributed to the reevaluation of the American cinema that was central to that method. By 1963 Rohmer was becoming more at odds with some of the more radical left-wing critics at Cahiers du Cinéma. He continued to admire US films while many of the other left-wing critics had rejected them and were championing cinéma vérité and Marxist film criticism. Rohmer resigned that year and was succeeded by Rivette. Film career =1950–1962: Shorts and early film career= In 1950 Rohmer made his first 16mm short film, Journal d'un scélérat. The film starred writer Paul Gégauff and was made with a borrowed camera. By 1951 Rohmer had a bigger budget provided by friends and shot the short film Présentation ou Charlotte et son steak. The 12-minute film was co-written by and starred Jean-Luc Godard. The film was not completed until 1961. In 1952 Rohmer began collaborating with Pierre Guilbaud on a one-hour short feature, Les Petites Filles modèles, but the film was never finished. In 1954 Rohmer made and acted in Bérénice, a 15-minute short based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1956 Rohmer directed, wrote, edited and starred in La Sonate à Kreutzer, a 50-minute film produced by Godard. In 1958 Rohmer made Véronique et son cancre, a 20-minute short produced by Chabrol. Chabrol's company AJYM produced Rohmer's feature directorial debut, The Sign of Leo (Le Signe du lion) in 1959. In the film an American composer spends the month of August waiting for his inheritance while all his friends are on vacation and gradually becomes impoverished. It included music by Louis Sagver. The Sign of Leo was later recut and rescored by distributors when Chabrol was forced to sell his production company, and Rohmer disowned the recut version.James Monaco. The New Wave. New York: Oxford University Press. 1976. p. 287. In 1962 Rohmer and Barbet Schroeder co-founded the production company Les Films du Losange (they were later joined by Pierre Coltrell in the late 1960s). Les Films du Losange produced all of Rohmer's work (except his last three features produced by La Compagnie Eric Rohmer).Agnès Poirier \\"Eric Rohmer: un hommage\\", The Guardian, 12 January 2010 =1962–1972: Six Moral Tales and television work= Rohmer's career began to gain momentum with his Six Moral Tales. Each of the films in the cycle follows the same story, inspired by F. W. Murnau's Sunrise (1927): a man, married or otherwise committed to a woman, is tempted by a second woman but eventually returns to the first.Glòria Salvadó Corretger, \\"Object/Subject: The Films of Eric Rohmer,\\" Formats (2005), http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti8_ing.htm . For Rohmer, these stories' characters \\"like to bring their motives, the reasons for their actions, into the open, they try to analyze, they are not people who act without thinking about what they are doing. What matters is what they think about their behavior, rather than their behavior itself.\\" The French word \\"moraliste\\" does not translate directly to the English \\"moralist\\" and has more to do with what someone thinks and feels. Rohmer cited the works of Blaise Pascal, Jean de La Bruyère, François de La Rochefoucauld and Stendhal as inspirations for the series.James Monaco. The New Wave. New York: Oxford University Press. 1976. He clarified, \\"a moraliste is someone who is interested in the description of what goes on inside man. He’s concerned with states of mind and feelings.\\" Regarding the repetition of a single storyline, he explained that it would allow him to explore six variations of the same theme. Plus, he stated, \\"I was determined to be inflexible and intractable, because if you persist in an idea it seems to me that in the end you do secure a following.\\" The first Moral Tale was The Bakery Girl of Monceau (1963). This 26-minute film portrays a young man, a college student, who sees a young woman in the street and spends days obsessively searching for her. He meets a second woman who works in a bakery and begins to flirt with her, but abandons her when he finally finds the first woman. Schroder starred as the young man and Bertrand Tavernier was the narrator. The second Moral Tale was Suzanne's Career (1963). This 60-minute film portrays a young student who is rejected by one woman and begins a romantic relationship with a second. The first and second Moral Tales were never theatrically released and Rohmer was disappointed by their poor technical quality. They were not well known until after the release of the other four. In 1963 Les Films du Losange produced the New Wave omnibus film Six in Paris, of which Rohmer's short \\"Place de l'Etoile\\" was the centerpiece. After being driven out of his editor position at Cahiers, Rohmer began making short documentaries for French television. Between 1964 and 1966 Rohmer made 14 shorts for television through the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF) and Télévision Scolaire. These included episodes of Filmmakers of Our Time on Louis Lumiere and Carl Theodor Dreyer, educational films on Blaise Pascal and Stéphane Mallarmé, and documentaries on the Percival legend, the industrial revolution and female students in Paris. Rohmer later said that television taught him how to make \\"readable images\\". He later said, \\"When you show a film on TV, the framing goes to pieces, straight lines are warped...the way people stand and walk and move, the whole physical dimension...all this is lost. Personally I don't feel that TV is an intimate medium.\\" In 1964 Rohmer made the 13-minute short film Nadja à Paris with cinematographer Nestor Almendros. Rohmer and Schroder then sold the rights of two of their short films to French television in order to raise $60,000 to produce the feature film La Collectionneuse in 1967, the third Moral Tale.James Monaco. The New Wave. New York: Oxford University Press. 1976. p. 288. The film's budget went only to film stock and renting a house in St. Tropez as a set. Rohmer described it as a film about l'amour par désoeuvrement (\\"love from idleness\\"). La Collectionneuse won the Jury Grand Prix at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival and was praised by French film critics, though US film critics called it \\"boring\\". The fourth Moral Tale was My Night at Maud's in 1969. The film was made with funds raised by Truffaut, who liked the script, and was initially intended to be the third Moral Tale. But because the film takes place on Christmas Eve, Rohmer wanted to shoot the film in December. Actor Jean-Louis Trintignant was not available so filming was delayed for a year.James Monaco. The New Wave. New York: Oxford University Press. 1976. p. 303. The film centers on Pascal's Wager and stars Trintignant, Françoise Fabian, Marie-Christine Barrault and Antoine Vitez. My Night at Maud's was Rohmer's first successful film both commercially and critically. It was screened and highly praised at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival and later won the Prix Max Ophüls. It was released in the US and praised by critics there as well. It eventually received Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Film. James Monaco wrote, \\"Here, for the first time the focus is clearly set on the ethical and existential question of choice. If it isn't clear within Maud who actually is making the wager and whether or not they win or lose, that only enlarges the idea of le pari (\\"the bet\\") into the encompassing metaphor that Rohmer wants for the entire series.\\" The fifth Moral Tale was Le genou de Claire (Claire's Knee, 1970). It won the Grand Prix at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, the Prix Louis Delluc and the Prix Méliès, and was a huge international success. Vincent Canby called it \\"something close to a perfect film.\\" It was Rohmer's second film in color. Rohmer said, \\"the presence of the lake and the mountains is stronger in color than in black and white. It is a film I couldn't imagine in black and white. The color green seems to me essential in that film...This film would have no value to me in black and white.\\" The sixth and final Moral Tale was 1972's Love in the Afternoon (released as Chloe in the Afternoon in the US). Molly Haskell criticized the film for betraying the rest of the series by making a moral judgment of the main character and approving of his decision in the film. Overall, Rohmer said he wanted the Six Moral Tales \\"to portray in film what seemed most alien to the medium, to express feelings buried deep in our consciousness. That's why they have to be narrated in the first person singular...The protagonist discusses himself and judges his actions. I film the process.\\" =1972–1987: Adaptations and Comedies and Proverbs= Following the Moral Tales Rohmer wanted to make a less personal film and adapted a novella by Heinrich von Kleist, La Marquise d'O... in 1976. It was one of Rohmer's most critically acclaimed films, with many critics ranking it with My Night at Maud's and Claire's Knee. Rohmer stated that \\"It wasn't simply the action I was drawn to, but the text itself. I didn't want to translate it into images, or make a filmed equivalent. I wanted to use the text as if Kleist himself had put it directly on the screen, as if he were making a movie ... Kleist didn't copy me and I didn't copy him, but obviously there was an affinity.\\" In 1978 Rohmer made the Holy Grail legend film Perceval le Gallois, based on a 12th-century manuscript by Chrétien de Troyes. The film received mostly poor critical reviews. Tom Milne said that the film was \\"almost universally greeted as a disappointment, at best a whimsical exercise in the faux-naif in its attempt to capture the poetic simplicity of medieval faith, at worse an anticlimatic blunder\\" and that it was \\"rather like watching the animation of a medieval manuscript, with the text gravely read aloud while the images — cramped and crowded, coloured with jewelled brilliance, delighting the eye with bizarre perspectives — magnificently play the role traditionally assigned to marginal illuminations.\\" In 1980 Rohmer made a film for television of his stage production of Kleist's play Catherine de Heilbronn, another work with a medieval setting.Review of Éric Rohmer coffret intégrale (Éditions Potemkine, 2013). Cathérine de Heilbronn is included as a supplement to the DVD disk Die Marquise von O. Retrieved 10 January 2015. Later in 1980 Rohmer embarked on a second series of films: the \\"Comedies and Proverbs\\", where each film was based on a proverb. The first \\"Comedy and proverb\\" was The Aviator's Wife, which was based on an idea that Rohmer had had since the mid-1940s. This was followed in 1981 with Le Beau Mariage (A Perfect Marriage), the second \\"Comedy and Proverb\\". Rohmer stated that \\"what interests me is to show how someone's imagination works. The fact that obsession can replace reality.\\" In his review of the film, film critic Claude Baignères said that \\"Eric Rohmer is a virtuoso of the pen sketch...[He had not been] at ease with the paint tubes that Persival required, [but in this film he created] a tiny figurine whose every feature, every curl, every tone is aimed at revealing to us a state of soul and of heart.\\" Raphael Bassan said that \\"the filmmaker fails to achieve in these dialogues the flexibility, the textual freedom of The Aviator's Wife. A Perfect Marriage is only a variation on the spiritual states of the petty bourgeoise who go on and on forever about the legitimacy of certain institutions or beliefs confronted by problems of the emotions. Quite simply, this is a minor variation on this central Rohmerian theme.\\" The third \\"Comedy and proverb\\" was Pauline at the Beach in 1983. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. It was based on an idea that Rohmer had in the 1950s, originally intended for Brigitte Bardot. Rohmer often made films that he had been working on his many years and stated \\"I can't say 'I make one film, then after that film I look for a subject and write on that subject...then I shoot.' Not at all...these are films that are drawn from one evolving mass, films that have been in my head for a long time and that I think about simultaneously.\\" The fourth \\"Comedy and Proverb\\" was Full Moon in Paris in 1984. The film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: \\"The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind.\\" The film's cinematographer Renato Berta called it \\"one of the most luxurious films ever made\\" because of the high amount of preparation put into it. The film began with Rohmer and the actors discussing their roles and reading from the film's scenario while tape recording the rehearsals. Rohmer then re-wrote the script based on these sessions and shot the film on Super 8mm as a dress rehearsal. When the film was finally shot, Rohmer often used between two and three takes for each shot, and sometimes only one take. Alain Bergala and Alain Philippon have stated that \\"all the art of Eric Rohmer consists of creating on the set avertable osmosis among himself, the actors and the technicians.\\" Rohmer even encouraged actress Pascale Ogier to design sets for the film since her character is an interior decorator. Ogier later won the Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival. Alain Philippon called the film \\"one of the most accomplished films that Rohmer has given us...and that if the film moves it is because of its own risk-taking.\\" The fifth \\"Comedy and Proverb\\" was The Green Ray in 1986. Rohmer explained that \\"I was struck by the naturalness of television interviews. You can say that here, nature is perfect. If you look for it, you find it because people forget the cameras.\\" As was becoming his custom in pre-production, Rohmer gathered his cast together to discuss the project and their characters, but then allowed each actor to invent their own dialogue. Rohmer stated that lead actress Marie Rivière \\"is the one who called the shots, not only by what she said, but by the way she'd speak, the way she'd question people, and also by the questions her character evoked from the others.\\" The film was shot chronologically and in 16mm so as to be \\"as inconspicuous as possible, to have Delphine blend into the crowd as a way, ultimately, of accentuating her isolation.\\" Rohmer also instructed his cinematographer Sophie Maintigneux to keep technical aspects of the shoot to a minimum so as to not interrupt or distract the actors. The film's only major expense was a trip to the Canary Islands in order to film the green rays there. Rohmer chose to première the film on Canal Plus TV, a pay-TV station that paid $130,000 for the film, which was only one fifth of its budget. Rohmer stated that \\"Cinema here will survive only because of television. Without such an alliance we won't be able to afford French films.\\" The experiment paid off when the film was a theatrical hit after being released three days after its initial broadcast. It won the Golden Lion and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Venice Film Festival. It was mostly praised by film critics, although Alain Robbe-Grillet wrote an unfavorable review and stated \\"I didn't like it very much.\\" The Sixth \\"Comedy and Proverb\\" was Boyfriends and Girlfriends (L'Ami de mon amie) in 1987. =1987–2009: Later film career= He followed these with a third series in the 1990s: Tales of the Four Seasons. Conte d’automne or Autumn Tale was a critically acclaimed release in 1999 when Rohmer was 79. The previous titles of the series were A Tale of Springtime (1990), A Tale of Winter (1992), and A Summer's Tale (1996). Beginning in the 2000s, Rohmer, in his eighties, returned to period drama with The Lady and the Duke and Triple Agent. The Lady and the Duke caused considerable controversy in France, where its negative portrayal of the French Revolution led some critics to label it monarchist propaganda. Its innovative cinematic style and strong acting performances led it to be well received elsewhere. In 2001, his life's work was recognised when he received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In 2007, Rohmer's final film, The Romance of Astrea and Celadon, was shown during the Venice Film Festival, at which he spoke of retiring. Style Rohmer's films concentrate on intelligent, articulate protagonists who frequently fail to own up to their desires. The contrast between what they say and what they do fuels much of the drama in his films. Gerard Legrand once said that \\"he is one of the rare filmmakers who is constantly inviting you to be intelligent, indeed, more intelligent than his (likable) characters.\\" Rohmer considered filmmaking to be \\"closer to the novel — to a certain classical style of novel which the cinema is now taking over — than the other forms of entertainment, like the theater.\\" Rohmer saw the full-face closeup as a device that does not reflect how we see each other and avoided its use. He avoids extradiegetic music (not coming from onscreen sound sources), seeing it as a violation of the fourth wall. He has on occasion departed from the rule by inserting soundtrack music in places in The Green Ray (1986) (released as Summer in the United States). Rohmer also tends to spend considerable time in his films showing his characters going from place to place, walking, driving, bicycling or commuting on a train, engaging the viewer in the idea that part of the day of each individual involves quotidian travel. This was most evident in (1982), which had the female protagonist constantly traveling, particularly between Paris and Le Mans. Rohmer typically populates his movies with people in their twenties and the settings are often on pleasant beaches and popular resorts, notably in La Collectionneuse (1967), Pauline at the Beach (1983), The Green Ray (1986) and A Summer's Tale (1996). These films are immersed in an environment of bright sunlight, blue skies, green grass, sandy beaches, and clear waters. He explained that \\"people sometimes ask me why most of the main characters in my films are young. I don't feel at ease with older people...I can't get people older than forty to talk convincingly.\\" Rohmer preferred to use non- professional actors in his films. He usually held a large number of rehearsals before shooting and would shoot his films very quickly. He spent little time editing his films. He usually shot his films chronologically, and often shot scenes during the time of day in which they took place. He explained that \\"my films are based on meteorology. If I didn't call the weather service everyday, I couldn't make my films because they're shot according to the weather outside. My films are slaves to weather.\\" The director's characters engage in long conversations—mostly talking about man-woman relationships but also on mundane issues like trying to find a vacation spot. There are also occasional digressions by the characters on literature and philosophy as most of Rohmer's characters are middle class and university educated. A Summer's Tale (1996) has most of the elements of a typical Rohmer film: no soundtrack music, no closeups, a seaside resort, long conversations between beautiful young people (who are middle class and educated) and discussions involving the characters' interests from songwriting to ethnology. Rohmer said he wanted to look at \\"thoughts rather than actions\\", dealing \\"less with what people do than what is going on in their minds while they are doing it.\\" Beginning in the late 1970s during the production of Perceval le Gallois Rohmer began to reduce the number of crew members on his films. He first dispensed of the script supervisor, then (controversially) cut out the assistant director, then all other assistants and technical managers until, by the time he shot The Green Ray in 1986, his crew consisted only of a camera operator and a sound engineer. Rohmer stated that \\"I even wonder if I could work in the usual conditions of filmmaking.\\" His style was famously criticised by Gene Hackman's character in the 1975 film Night Moves who describes viewing Rohmer's films as \\"kind of like watching paint dry\\". Rohmer was a highly literary man. His films frequently refer to ideas and themes in plays and novels, such as references to Jules Verne (in The Green Ray), William Shakespeare (in A Winter's Tale) and Pascal's Wager (in Ma nuit chez Maud). Personal life and death René Schérer, a philosopher, is his brother and René Monzat, a journalist, is his son. In 1957, Rohmer married Thérèse Barbet. The couple had two sons. Rohmer was a devout Catholic and \\"ecological zealot\\". For years Rohmer had no telephone and refused to even get into cars, which he called \\"immoral pollutors.\\" For many years he was known to jog two miles to his office every morning. He was well known for his need for personal privacy and sometimes wore disguises, such as wearing a false moustache at the New York premiere of one of his films. Rohmer's mother died without ever knowing that her son Maurice was in fact a famous film director named Éric Rohmer. He stated that his favorite film director was Jean Renoir. Rohmer died on the morning of 11 January 2010 at the age of 89 after a series of strokes.Anoine de Baecque and Noël Herpe Éric Rohmer : a biography. New York: Columbia University Press. 2016. He had been admitted to hospital the previous week. The former Culture Minister Jack Lang said he was \\"one of the masters of French cinema\\". Director Thierry Fremaux described his work as \\"unique\\". Rohmer's grave is located in district 13 of Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. During the 2010 César Awards, actor Fabrice Luchini presented a special tribute to him: > I’m gonna read a remarkable text written by Jacques Fieschi: \\"Writer, > director; creator of “the cinematographe”, challenger of \\"Les cahiers du > cinema\\", which recently published a special edition on Eric Rohmer. Truffaut > once said he was one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, Godard > was his brother, Chabrol admired him, Wenders couldn’t stop taking photos of > him.

Governance The college is directed by an eight-member Board of Regents confirmed by the Government Services Committee of the Navajo Nation Council. The name Diné comes from the traditional name for the Navajo, meaning \\"the people.\\"  History  Diné College opened in 1968 as the \\"Navajo Community College\\", the first college established by Native Americans for Native Americans. The College was chartered by the Navajo Nation in 1968. The college was originally housed at the Rough Rock Community School in Rough Rock, Arizona, while the Tsalie campus was under construction. Ned Hatathli was chosen as the first president of Navajo Community College in 1969 when the Tsaile campus opened for classes, however, his presidency ended tragically when he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his rifle on October 16, 1972. Tommy Lewis became president in August 1992 and funding from the BIA was about $4 million per year. Under his leadership, funding from the BIA increased to almost $7.3 million by the year 2000. The Navajo Language and Culture Curriculum became widely popular at the Tsaile campus after the program saw increases in class enrollment, thus allowing the Board of Regents to implement the program throughout the institution. Under the 1994 Equity in Education Act, Diné College became a Land Grant Institution allowing the institution to receive funding from the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. During the Summer of 1997, the administration changed the name of the college from Navajo Community College to Diné College in order to better to represent the school's function as an institution of learning for the Diné/Navajo people. In 1998, Diné College bestowed its first baccalaureate degrees under the Diné Teacher Education Program, accredited through a partnership with Arizona State University. In 1998, the Diné College Library was rededicated as the \\"Kinyaa'áanii Charlie Benally Memorial Library\\". On May 21, 2011, the women's archery team made history by winning the United States college national championship in compound bow. This is believed to be the first time a tribal college team has won a top-tier intercollegiate national championship event in any sport.

As a result, prompt criticality causes a much more rapid growth in the rate of energy release than other forms of criticality. Nuclear weapons are based on prompt criticality, while most nuclear reactors rely on delayed neutrons to achieve criticality.  Criticality  An assembly is critical if each fission event causes, on average, exactly one additional such event in a continual chain. Such a chain is a self-sustaining fission chain reaction. When a uranium-235 (U-235) atom undergoes nuclear fission, it typically releases between one and seven neutrons (with an average of 2.4). In this situation, an assembly is critical if every released neutron has a 1/2.4 = 0.42 = 42% probability of causing another fission event as opposed to either being absorbed by a non-fission capture event or escaping from the fissile core. The average number of neutrons that cause new fission events is called the effective neutron multiplication factor, usually denoted by the symbols k-effective, k-eff or k. When k-effective is equal to 1, the assembly is called critical, if k-effective is less than 1 the assembly is said to be subcritical, and if k-effective is greater than 1 the assembly is called supercritical.  Critical versus prompt-critical  In a supercritical assembly the number of fissions per unit time, N, along with the power production, increases exponentially with time. How fast it grows depends on the average time it takes, T, for the neutrons released in a fission event to cause another fission. The growth rate of the reaction is given by: :N(t) = N_0 k^{t/T} , Most of the neutrons released by a fission event are the ones released in the fission itself. These are called prompt neutrons, and strike other nuclei and cause additional fissions within nanoseconds (an average time interval used by scientists in the Manhattan Project was one shake, or 10 nanoseconds). A small additional source of neutrons is the fission products. Some of the nuclei resulting from the fission are radioactive isotopes with short half-lives, and nuclear reactions among them release additional neutrons after a long delay of up to several minutes after the initial fission event. These neutrons, which on average account for less than one percent of the total neutrons released by fission, are called delayed neutrons. The relatively slow timescale on which delayed neutrons appear is an important aspect for the design of nuclear reactors, as it allows the reactor power level to be controlled via the gradual, mechanical movement of control rods. Typically, control rods contain neutron poisons (substances, for example boron or hafnium, that easily capture neutrons without producing any additional ones) as a means of altering k-effective. With the exception of experimental pulsed reactors, nuclear reactors are designed to operate in a delayed- critical mode and are provided with safety systems to prevent them from ever achieving prompt criticality. In a delayed-critical assembly, the delayed neutrons are needed to make k-effective greater than one. Thus the time between successive generations of the reaction, T, is dominated by the time it takes for the delayed neutrons to be released, on the order of seconds or minutes. Therefore, the reaction will increase slowly, with a long time constant. This is slow enough to allow the reaction to be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods, and as such all nuclear reactors are designed to operate in the delayed-criticality regime. In contrast, a critical assembly is said to be prompt-critical if it is critical (k=1) without any contribution from delayed neutrons and prompt-supercritical if it is supercritical (the fission rate growing exponentially, k>1) without any contribution from delayed neutrons. In this case the time between successive generations of the reaction, T, is only limited by the fission rate from the prompt neutrons, and the increase in the reaction will be extremely rapid, causing a rapid release of energy within a few milliseconds. Prompt- critical assemblies are created by design in nuclear weapons and some specially designed research experiments. When differentiating between a prompt neutron versus a delayed neutron, the difference between the two has to do with the source from which the neutron has been released into the reactor. The neutrons, once released, have no difference except the energy or speed which have been imparted to them. A nuclear weapon relies heavily on prompt- supercriticality (to produce a high peak power in a fraction of a second), whereas nuclear power reactors use delayed-criticality to produce controllable power levels for months or years.  Nuclear reactors  In order to start up a controllable fission reaction, the assembly must be delayed-critical. In other words, k must be greater than 1 (supercritical) without crossing the prompt-critical threshold. In nuclear reactors this is possible due to delayed neutrons. Because it takes some time before these neutrons are emitted following a fission event, it is possible to control the nuclear reaction using control rods. A steady-state (constant power) reactor is operated so that it is critical due to the delayed neutrons, but would not be so without their contribution. During a gradual and deliberate increase in reactor power level, the reactor is delayed-supercritical. The exponential increase of reactor activity is slow enough to make it possible to control the criticality factor, k, by inserting or withdrawing rods of neutron absorbing material. Using careful control rod movements, it is thus possible to achieve a supercritical reactor core without reaching an unsafe prompt-critical state. Once a reactor plant is operating at its target or design power level, it can be operated to maintain its critical condition for long periods of time. = Prompt critical accidents = Nuclear reactors can be susceptible to prompt- criticality accidents if a large increase in reactivity (or k-effective) occurs, e.g., following failure of their control and safety systems. The rapid uncontrollable increase in reactor power in prompt-critical conditions is likely to irreparably damage the reactor and in extreme cases, may breach the containment of the reactor. Nuclear reactors' safety systems are designed to prevent prompt criticality and, for defense in depth, reactor structures also provide multiple layers of containment as a precaution against any accidental releases of radioactive fission products. With the exception of research and experimental reactors, only a small number of reactor accidents are thought to have achieved prompt criticality, for example Chernobyl #4, the U.S. Army's SL-1, and Soviet submarine K-431. In all these examples the uncontrolled surge in power was sufficient to cause an explosion that destroyed each reactor and released radioactive fission products into the atmosphere. At Chernobyl in 1986, an poorly-understood positive scram effect resulted in an overheated reactor core. This led to the rupturing of the fuel elements and water pipes, vaporization of water, a steam explosion, and a meltdown. Estimated power levels prior to the incident suggest that it operated in excess of 30 GW, ten times its 3 GW maximum thermal output. The reactor chamber's 2000-ton lid was lifted by the steam explosion. Since the reactor was not designed with a containment building capable of containing this catastrophic explosion, the accident released large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. In the other two incidents, the reactor plants failed due to errors during a maintenance shutdown that was caused by the rapid and uncontrolled removal of at least one control rod. The SL-1 was a prototype reactor intended for use by the US Army in remote polar locations. At the SL-1 plant in 1961, the reactor was brought from shutdown to prompt critical state by manually extracting the central control rod too far. As the water in the core quickly converted to steam and expanded (in just a few milliseconds), the reactor vessel jumped , leaving impressions in the ceiling above. See summary: All three men performing the maintenance procedure died from injuries. 1,100 curies of fission products were released as parts of the core were expelled. It took 2 years to investigate the accident and clean up the site. The excess prompt reactivity of the SL-1 core was calculated in a 1962 report:IDO-19313 Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion, Final Report of Progress July through October 1962, November 1962. In the K-431 reactor accident, 10 were killed during a refueling operation. The K-431 explosion destroyed the adjacent machinery rooms and ruptured the submarine's hull. In these two catastrophes, the reactor plants went from complete shutdown to extremely high power levels in a fraction of a second, damaging the reactor plants beyond repair. List of accidental prompt critical excursions A number of research reactors and tests have purposely examined the operation of a prompt critical reactor plant. CRAC, KEWB, SPERT-I, Godiva device, and BORAX experiments contributed to this research. However, many accidents have also occurred, primarily during research and processing of nuclear fuel. SL-1 is the notable exception. The following list of prompt critical power excursions is adapted from a report submitted in 2000 by a team of American and Russian nuclear scientists who studied criticality accidents, published by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, the location of many of the excursions.A Review of Criticality Accidents, Los Alamos National Laboratory, LA-13638, May 2000.

Indeed, one of the design problems to overcome in constructing a bomb is to compress the fissile materials enough to achieve prompt criticality before the chain reaction has a chance to produce enough energy to cause the core to expand too much. A good bomb design must therefore win the race to a dense, prompt critical core before a less-powerful chain reaction disassembles the core without allowing a significant amount of fuel to fission (known as a fizzle). This generally means that nuclear bombs need special attention paid to the way the core is assembled, such as the implosion method invented by Richard C. Tolman, Robert Serber, and other scientists at the University of California, Berkeley in 1942.

The yellow perch was described in 1814 by Samuel Latham Mitchill from New York. It is closely related, and morphologically similar to the European perch (Perca fluviatilis); and is sometimes considered a subspecies of its European counterpart. Other common names for yellow perch include American perch, coontail, lake perch, raccoon perch, ring-tail perch, ringed perch, and striped perch. Another nickname for the perch is the Dodd fish. Latitudinal variability in age, growth rates, and size have been observed among populations of yellow perch, likely resulting from differences in day length and annual water temperatures. In many populations, yellow perch often live 9 to 10 years, with adults generally ranging from in length. The world record yellow perch (; ) was caught in 1865 in New Jersey, and is the longest-standing record for freshwater fish in North America. Description The yellow perch has an elongate, oval body with a relatively long but blunt snout which does not reach past the tip of the lower jaw. Like most perches it has two separate dorsal fins The anterior, or first, dorsal fin contains 12-14 spines while the second has 2-3 spines in its anterior followed by 12-13 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 spines and 7-8 soft rays. The upper part of the head and body varies in colour from bright green through to olive or golden brown. although typically they are golden yellow. The colour on the upper body extends onto the flanks where it creates a pattern of 6-8 vertical bars over a background colour of yellow or yellowish green. They normally show a blackish blotch on the membrane of the first dorsal fin between the rearmost 3 or 4 spines. The colour of the dorsal and caudal fins vary from yellow to green while the anal and pelvic fins may be yellow through to silvery white. The pectoral fins are transparent and amber in colour. The ventral part of the body is white. The juvenile fish are paler and can have an almost whitish background colour. The maximum recorded total length is . although they are more common;y around , and the maximum published weight is . Distribution Yellow perch are only found in North America; they are native to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River and Mississippi River basins. In Canada, its native range extends throughout Nova Scotia and Quebec north to the Mackenzie River. It also is common in the northwest to Great Slave Lake and west into Alberta. It is not native to any other areas of Canada. In the United States, the native range extends south into Ohio and Illinois, and throughout most of the northeastern United States. It is also considered native to the Atlantic Slope basin, extending south to the Savannah River. There is also a small native population in the Dead Lakes region of the Apalachicola River system in Florida.https://myfwc.com/research/freshwater/sport-fishes/yellow-perch/ The yellow perch has also been widely introduced for sport and commercial fishing purposes. It has also been introduced to establish a forage base for bass and walleye. These introductions were predominantly performed by the U.S. Fish Commission in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, unauthorized introductions have likely occurred from illegal introductions, dispersal through connected waterways, and use as live bait. Isolated populations now occur in the northwest and southwest portions of the United States. Currently, the yellow perch has not been introduced outside of North America. Introductions in Canada have been less intense than in the United States. It has been extirpated in Arkansas. Biology Yellow perch typically reach sexual maturity in 2–3 years for males and 3–4 years for females. They are iteroparous, spawning annually in the spring when water temperatures are between . Spawning is communal and typically occurs at night. Yellow perch are oviparous, as eggs are fertilized externally. Eggs are laid in a gelatinous strand (commonly 10,000–40,000), a characteristic unique among North American freshwater fishes. Egg strands are commonly draped over weeds, the branches of submerged trees or shrubs, or some other structure. Eggs hatch in 11–27 days, depending on temperature and other abiotic factors. They are commonly found in the littoral zones of both large and small lakes, but they also inhabit slow- moving rivers and streams, brackish waters, and ponds. Yellow perch commonly reside in shallow water, but are occasionally found deeper than or on the bottom. In the northern waters, perch tend to live longer and grow at a slower rate. Females in general are larger, grow faster, live longer, and mature in 3-4 years compared to males, which mature in 2-3 years at a smaller size. Most research has showed the maximum age to be about 9–10 years, with a few living past 11 years. The preferred temperature range for the yellow perch is , with an optimum range of and a lethal limit in upwards of and a stress limit over . Yellow perch spawn once a year in spring using large schools and shallow areas of a lake or low-current tributary streams. They do not build a redd or nest. Spawning typically takes place at night or in the early morning. Females have the potential to spawn up to eight times in their lifetimes. A small aquaculture industry in the US Midwest contributes about of yellow perch annually, but the aquaculture is not expanding rapidly. The yellow perch is absolutely crucial to the survival of the walleye and largemouth bass in its range. Cormorants feed heavily on yellow perch in early spring, but over the entire season, only 10% of their diets is perch. Cormorants and anglers combined harvest 40% of 1- and 2-year-old yellow perch and 25% of the adult yellow perch population in Lake Michigan. Total annual mortality of adult yellow perch has not changed since cormorant colonization. General description Yellow perch is often recognized by its dark vertical stripes and gold or yellow body color. Perca is derived from early Greek for \\"perch\\" and flavescens is Latin for \\"becoming gold\\" or \\"yellow colored\\". Adult sizes typically range from 3.9–11.4 in (10–30 cm); though have been known to grow larger. The yellow perch has a laterally compressed body with an oval, oblong shape. The anal fins are a green or yellow-orange, the dorsal fin is an olive color, and the belly is cream-colored. The vertical bands fade as they near the belly. Spawning intensifies the bands in males, and they can be nonexistent in juveniles. The spiny anterior dorsal fin has 13 to 15 spines. The soft rear fins also have one or two spines, but which are mostly made up of rays that range from 12 to 15 in number. The pelvic fins are close together, and the homocercal caudal fin is forked. The operculum tip has one spine, and the anal fin has two spines. Seven or eight branchiostegal rays are seen. Yellow perch have many fine and sharp teeth. They are rough to the touch because of their ctenoid scales. Common names for the perch are yellow perch, American perch, and lake perch. Yellow perch are one of the smaller-sized members of the perch family (Percidae). Due to their ability to crossbreed and their similar morphology, yellow perch are sometimes classified as a subspecies of the European perch. For over 100 years, Canada and the United States have been commercially harvesting yellow perch in the Great Lakes with trapnets, gillnets, and poundnets. In Canada, the estimated catch in 2002 was 3,622 tons with a value of $16.7 million, second only to walleye at $28.2 million. The greatest demand in the United States is in the north-central region, where nearly 70% of all yellow perch sales in the US occur within 80 km (49.7 mi) of the Great Lakes. Yellow perch is one of the easiest fish to catch, and can be taken in all seasons, and tastes great. Therefore, it is a desirable sport fish in some locations of the US and Canada. It even makes up around 85% of the sport fish caught in Lake Michigan. Geographic distribution Yellow perch are native to North America in the northern region east of the Rocky Mountains, including tributaries of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans and the Mississippi River. Native distribution was driven by postglacial melt from the Mississippi River. It has been widely dispersed from its native range. Its distribution to other areas of the eastern US and Canada are due to its popularity as a sport and commercial fish, as well as being a forage fish for other sport fish species, such as bass or walleye. The current native and introduced range in the United States is through northern Missouri to western Pennsylvania to South Carolina and north to Maine. Introduced areas currently have not expanded outside of North America. These introductions were predominantly performed by the US Fish Commission in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The non-native dispersal was not as intense in Canada. It was primarily limited to the lakes in the Peace River drainage of British Columbia, but has currently expanded to other bordering areas since. Yellow perch are commonly found in the littoral zones of both large and small lakes, but also inhabit slow-moving rivers and streams, brackish waters, and ponds. Due to human intervention, they are currently found in many man-made lakes, reservoirs, and river impoundments. The perch are most abundant in lakes that may be warm or cool and are extremely productive in smaller lakes where they can dominate unless controlled by predation. Ecology Primarily, age and body size determine the diets of yellow perch. Zooplankton is the primary food source for young and larval perch. By age one, they shift to macroinvertebrates, such as midges and mosquitos. Large adult perch feed on invertebrates, fish eggs, crayfish, mysid shrimp, and juvenile fish. They have been known to be predominantly piscivorous and even cannibalistic in some cases. About 20% of the diet of a yellow perch over 32 g (1.1 oz) in weight consists of small fish. Maximum feeding occurs just before dark, with typical consumption averaging 1.4% of their body weight. Their microhabitat is usually along the shore among reeds and aquatic weeds, docks, and other structures. They are most dense within aquatic vegetation, since they naturally school, but also prefer small, weed-filled water bodies with muck, gravel, or sand bottoms. They are less abundant in deep and clear open water or unproductive lakes. Within rivers, they only frequent pools, slack water, and moderately vegetated habitat. They frequent inshore surface waters during the summer. Almost every cool- to warm-water predatory fish species, such as northern pike, muskellunge, bass, sunfish, crappie, walleye, trout, and even other yellow perch, are predators of the yellow perch. They are the primary prey for walleye Sander vitreus, and they consume 58% of the age zero and 47% of the age one yellow perch in northern lakes. However, in shallow natural lakes, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides may be most influential in structuring the quality of yellow perch populations. In Nebraska's Sandhill lakes, the mean weight and quality of yellow perch is not related to invertebrate abundance, but is related to the abundance of largemouth bass. The three primary factors influencing quality panfish populations are predators, prey, and the environment.Paukert, C. P., Willis, D. W., Klammer, Joel A. 2002. Effects of predation and environment on quality of yellow perch and Bluegill populations in Nebraska sandhill lakes. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 22(1): 86–95. In eastern North America, yellow perch are an extremely important food source for birds such as double-crested cormorants. The cormorants specifically target yellow perch as primary prey. Other birds also prey on them, such as eagles, herring gulls, hawks, diving ducks, kingfishers, herons, mergansers, loons, and white pelicans. High estimates show that cormorants were capable of consuming 29% of the age-three perch population. In Canada, yellow perch are effective at escaping predation seasonally by lake trout and other native fishes during summer due to their high thermal tolerance. Parasites and diseases in yellow perch are often shared with salmonids in eastern North American lakes. A few examples are: brain parasite Flavobacterium columnare, red worm Eustrongylides tubifex, broad tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum, and parasitic copepods Ergasilus spp.Burnett, J. A. D., Ringler, N. H., Lantry, Brian F., and Johnson, James H. 2002. Double-crested cormorant predation on yellow perch in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario. Journal of Great Lakes Research 28(2): 202–211. Perch are commonly active during the day and inactive at night except during spawning, when they are active both day and night. Perch are most often found in schools. Their vision is necessary for schooling and the schools break up at dusk and reform at dawn. The schools typically contain 50 to 200 fish, and are arranged by age and size in a spindle shape. Younger perch tend to school more than older and larger fish, which occasionally travel alone, and males and females often form separate schools. Some perch are migratory, but only in a short and local form. They also have been observed leading a semianadromous life. Yellow perch do not accelerate quickly and are relatively poor swimmers. The fastest recorded speed for a school was 54 cm/s (12.08 mph), with individual fish swimming at less than half that speed. Life history Yellow perch spawn once a year in spring using large schools and shallow areas of a lake or low-current tributary streams. They do not build a redd or nest. Females have the potential to spawn up to eight times in their lifetimes. Two to five males go to the spawning grounds first and are with the female throughout the spawning process. The female deposits her egg mass, and then at least two males release their milt over the eggs, with the total process taking about five seconds. The males stay with the eggs for a short time, but the females leave immediately. No parental care is provided for the eggs or fry. The average clutch size is 23,000 eggs, but can range from 2,000 to 90,000. The egg mass is jelly-like, semibuoyant, and can reach up to 2 m long. The egg mass attaches to some vegetation, while the rest flows with the water current. Other substrate includes sand, gravel, rubble, and submerged trees and brush in wetland habitat. Yellow perch eggs are thought to contain a chemical in the jelly-like sheath that protects the eggs and makes them undesirable since they are rarely ever eaten by other fish. The eggs usually hatch in 8-10 days, but can take up to 21 days depending on temperature and proper spawning habitat. Yellow perch do not travel far during the year, but move into deeper water during winter and return to shallow water in spring to spawn. Spawning occurs in the spring when water temperatures are between 6.7 and 12.8°C. Growth of fry is initiated at 6–10°C, but is inactive below 5.3°C. Larval yellow perch survival is based on a variety of factors, such as wind speed, turbidity, food availability, and food composition. Immediately after hatching, yellow perch head for the pelagic shores to school and are typically 5 mm long at this point. This pelagic phase is usually 30–40 days long. Sexual dimorphism is known to occur in the northern waters where females are often larger, grow faster, live longer, and mature in 3-4 years. Males mature in 2-3 years at a smaller size. Perch do not grow as large in the northern waters, but tend to live longer. Maximum age estimates vary widely. The age of the perch is highly based on the condition of the lake. Most research has shown the maximum age to be approximately 9–10 years, with a few living past 11 years. Yellow perch have been proven to grow the best in lakes where they are piscivorous due to the lack of predators. Perch do not perform well in cold, deep, oligotrophic lakes. Seasonal movements tend to follow the 20°C isotherm and water temperature is the most important factor influencing fish distribution. Yellow perch commonly reside in shallow water, but are occasionally found deeper than 15 m or on the bottom. Their optimum temperature range is 21–24°C, but have been known to adapt to warmer or cooler habitats. The common lethal limit is 26.5°C, but some research has shown it to be upwards of 33°C with a stress limit at anything over 26°C. To grow properly, yellow perch prefer a pH of 7 to 8. The tolerable pH ranges have been found to be about 3.9 to 9.5. They also may survive in brackish and saline waters, as well as water with low dissolved oxygen levels. Current management Managers employed management techniques at Drummond Island, Michigan, such as harassing the cormorants and killing them as needed. Overall, the harassment deterred 90% of cormorant foraging attempts, while killing less than 6% on average at each site; yellow perch abundance increased significantly due to their being the predominant prey of cormorants by total number and weight at that lake.Brian, S. D., Moerke, A., Bur, M., Bassett, C., Aderman, T., Traynor, D., Singleton, R. D. Butchko, P. H., and Taylor, J. D. II 2010. Evaluation of harassment of migrating double-crested cormorants to limit depredation on selected sport fisheries in Michigan. Journal of Great Lakes Research 36(2): 215–223. Lakes in South Dakota without suitable spawning substrate have had conifers introduced, such as short-needle spruce, to increase both spawning habitat and hatching success. Managers have identified seven key unauthorized pathways for the introduction of the yellow perch to non-native regions: shipping, recreational and commercial boating, construction of new canals and water diversions, releases from live food fish markets, releases from the aquarium and water garden trade, use of live bait, and illegal introductions to create new fisheries. The most likely unofficial pathways are illegal introductions, dispersal through connected waterways, and live bait. Many authorized introductions by natural resources agencies have taken place, as well, due to the sport-fishing demand. In 2000, the parasite Heterosporis spp. was discovered in yellow perch on the Eagle River Chain of Lakes in Vilas County in Wisconsin, and has since been found in Minnesota, Michigan, and Ontario. The parasite does not infect people, but can infect many important sport and forage fish including the yellow perch. It does not kill the infected fish, but the flesh of a severely infected fish becomes inedible when the fish dies and the spores are then spread through the water to infect another fish. That concerns commercial fisherman in the Great Lakes regions that depend on these fish. The infected perch are not marketable. The current infection rates are 5% of harvest. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia is another serious disease in perch in the Great Lakes region. It has already killed thousands of drum in Lake Ontario and caused a large die-off of yellow perch in Lake Erie in 2006. Ontario is restricting commercial bait licenses as a precaution against this disease. Outside its native range, very few diseases or parasites have been found. =Fishing= Yellow perch are a popular sport fish, prized by both recreational anglers and commercial fishermen for their delicious, mild flavor. Because yellow perch are among the finest flavored pan fish, they are occasionally misrepresented on menus within the restaurant industry. White perch, rock bass, and many species of sunfish (genus Lepomis) are sometimes referred to as \\"perch\\" on menus. The voracious feeding habits of yellow perch make them fairly easy to catch when schools are located, and they are frequently caught by recreational anglers targeting other species. Perch at times attack lures normally used for bass such a 3\\" tubes, Rapala minnows, and larger curl tail grubs on jigheads, and small, brightly colored casting spoons, but the simplest way to catch them is to use light line, 4 to 8# test and light, unpainted jig heads, 1/32–1/16 oz. Too many small soft plastic lure designs to mention can catch all panfish, but minnow-shaped lures with a quivering tail work much of the time, so long as the retrieval speed is slow and the lure is fished at the depth the perch are swimming. Thin, straight- tail grubs require the slowest speed of retrieval and are preferred when the bite is slow, which is much of the time. Some good baits for perch include worms, live and dead minnows, small freshwater clams, crickets, and any small lure resembling any of these. Larger perch are often caught on large live minnow on a jighead, especially when fished over weed beds. Bobbers, if used, should be spindle type for the least resistance when the bait is struck, but small, round bobbers work well, too, yet indicate any slight pull of the bait. Raising the rod tip is usually more than enough force to set the hook. Some yellow perch fisheries have been affected through intense harvesting, and commercial and recreational harvest rates often are regulated by management agencies. In most aquatic systems, yellow perch are an important prey source for larger, piscivorous species, and many fishing lures are designed to resemble yellow perch, though fish-eating fish do not have the intelligence to tell the difference between lures, but are some times wary of lures.

As Little Joe and Georgia celebrate at a nightclub one evening, Petunia joins them, determined to win Joe back. Little Joe fights with Domino for Petunia, and Petunia, anguished at this turn of events, prays to God to destroy the nightclub. A cyclone appears and leaves the nightclub in ruins, as Joe and Petunia lie dead in the ruins after being shot by Domino. Just as it appears that Joe's soul is lost forever, the angelic General informs him that Georgia Brown was so affected by the tragedy that she has donated all the money that Joe had lavished upon her to the church. On this technicality, Little Joe is allowed to go to Heaven with Petunia. As the two climb the Celestial Stairs, Joe suddenly wakes in his own bed. Joe had not been killed in the initial gambling-debt fracas, only wounded. All his supposed dealings with angels and demons were only a fever dream. Now genuinely reformed, Little Joe begins a new, happy life with his loving Petunia. Cast Production According to liner notes in the CD reissue of the film's soundtrack, Freed and Minnelli sought input from black leaders before production began on the film. The script was submitted before production to the NAACP. In a letter to the Editor, a writer of the film said he received a letter \\"congratulating [them] on the treatment of this black fable, which avoided cliches and racial stereotypes.\\"The New York Times, What Blacks Thought of 'Cabin in the Sky', February 2nd 1983 Songs #\\"Little Black Sheep\\" - Ethel Waters and Chorus #\\"Old Ship of Zion\\" - Chorus #\\"Happiness is a Thing Called Joe\\" – Ethel Waters #\\"Cabin in the Sky\\" – Ethel Waters & Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson #\\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" – Ethel Waters #\\"Life is Full of Consequence\\" - Lena Horne & Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson #\\"Things Ain't What They Used To Be\\" - Duke Ellington and his orchestra #\\"Going Up\\" - Duke Ellington and his orchestra #\\"Shine\\" – \\"Bubbles\\" John W.

Retrieved September 10, 2011 The spleen is an important immunological organ that acts as a filter for red blood cells, triggers phagocytosis of invaders, and mounts an immunological response when necessary. Lack of a spleen, called asplenia, can occur by autosplenectomy or the surgical counterpart, splenectomy. Asplenia can increase susceptibility to infection. Autosplenectomy can occur in cases of sickle-cell disease where the misshapen cells block blood flow to the spleen, causing scarring and eventual atrophy of the organ. Autosplenectomy is a rare condition that is linked to certain diseases but is not a common occurrence. It is also seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Consequences Absence of effective splenic function or absence of the whole spleen (asplenia) is associated with increased risks of overwhelming post splenectomy infection, especially from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria and organisms that invade erythrocytes. People without a spleen have a weakened immune system, although other immune organs compensate for the missing spleen. Vaccination against encapsulated bacteria and prophylactic antibiotics can be used to counteract lowered immunity in asplenic patients. Specifically, people without a spleen are recommended to be vaccinated against pneumonia, influenza, Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococci. = Testing for autosplenectomy = One of the spleen's main tasks is to filter the blood and remove and recycle damaged or old red blood cells. Splenic function can be measured by filtering capabilities, as indicated by number of Howell-Jolly bodies or pitted erythrocytes in the blood. Both of these tests examine whether or not the spleen is functioning normally by testing splenic outputs.  Howell-Jolly bodies  Howell–Jolly bodies are found on red blood cells and contain chromatin remnants from basophilic cells. Under normal conditions, these nuclear remnants are removed from the blood by the spleen's filtering capabilities. Howell-Jolly bodies can be identified and quantified using a blood smear or by flow cytometry. A high number of Howell-Jolly bodies is indicative of splenic hypofunction and potentially autosplenectomy.  Pitted erythrocytes  Erythrocytes with membrane pits can be indicative of splenic dysfunction as a healthy spleen clears blood of pitted erythrocytes. Pitted erythrocytes can be counted using Normarsky optics. Humans with healthy spleens have less than two percent of their red blood cells contain pits. In comparison, a person with asplenia may have up to 50% of their red blood cells contain pits. Diseases that cause autosplenectomy =Sickle cell anemia= The most frequent cause of autosplenectomy is sickle cell anemia which causes progressive splenic hypofunction over time. Increased deoxygenation causes sickling of red blood cells, which adhere to the spleen wall and splenic macrophages causing ischemia. This ischemia can result in splenic sequestration, where large amounts of blood pool in the spleen but do not flow within vasculature. This lack of blood flow can cause atrophy in the spleen and can lead to autosplenectomy. = Pneumococcal sepsis = Pneumococcal sepsis, or whole-body infection caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, has been reported to cause autosplenectomy but is a very rare and poorly understood complication of the infection.

Located in the central and southern regions of the Korean Peninsula, the Samhan confederacies eventually merged and developed into the Baekje, Gaya, and Silla kingdoms. The name \\"Samhan\\" also refers to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Sam () is a Sino-Korean word meaning \\"three,\\" and Han is a Korean word meaning \\"great (one), grand, large, in the midst (of)\\". Han was transliterated into Chinese characters , , , or , but is unrelated with the Han in Han Chinese and the Chinese kingdoms and dynasties also called Han (漢) and Han (韓). The word Han is still found in many Korean words such as Hangawi (한가위) — archaic native Korean for Chuseok (秋夕, 추석), Hangaram (한가람) — archaic native Korean for Hangang (漢江, 한강), Hanbat (한밭) — the original place name in native Korean for Daejeon (大田, 대전), Hanabaji (한아바지) — the original form of 할아버지 (Harabeoji, grandfather). Ma means south, Byeon means shining and Jin means east.在韓國使用的漢字語文化上的程 Many historians have suggested that the word Han might have been pronounced as Gan or Kan. The Silla language had a usage of this word for king or ruler as found in the words 마립간 (麻立干; Maripgan) and 거서간 / 거슬한 (居西干 / 居瑟邯; Geoseogan / Geoseulhan). Alexander Vovin suggests this word is related to the Mongolian Khan and Manchurian Han meaning ruler, and the ultimate origin is Xiongnu and Yeniseian.\\"ONCE AGAIN ON THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE TITLE qaγan\\" Alexander Vovin, Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia vol. 12 Kraków 2007 (http://ejournals.eu/sj/index.php/SEC/article/viewFile/1100/1096) The Samhan are thought to have formed around the time of the fall of Gojoseon in northern Korea in 108 BC. Kim Bu-sik's Samguk sagi, one of the two representative history books of Korea, mentions that people of Jin Han are migrants from Gojoseon, which suggests that early Han tribes who came to Southern Korean penninsula are originally Gojoseon people. However,the state of Jin in southern Korea, which its evidence of actual existence lacks, also disappears from written records. By the 4th century, Mahan was fully absorbed into the Baekje kingdom, Jinhan into the Silla kingdom, and Byeonhan into the Gaya confederacy, which was later annexed by Silla. Beginning in the 7th century, the name \\"Samhan\\" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The \\"Han\\" in the names of the Korean Empire, Daehan Jeguk, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Daehan Minguk or Hanguk, are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.  Etymology  \\"Samhan\\" became a name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea beginning in the 7th century. According to the Samguk sagi and Samguk yusa, Silla implemented a national policy, \\"Samhan Unification\\" (), to integrate Baekje and Goguryeo refugees. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in Cheongju with an inscription: \\"The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded.\\" During the Later Silla period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged. In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, Choe Chiwon equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo. By the Goryeo period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea. In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, Wang Geon declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the Joseon period and was widely referenced in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century. The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the Tang dynasty. Goguryeo was alternately called Mahan by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals \\"Mahan leaders\\" () in 645. In 651, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan. Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea \\"Samhan\\", especially Goguryeo. For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon (), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a \\"Liaodong Samhan man\\" (). The History of Liao equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo. In 1897, Gojong changed the name of Joseon to the Korean Empire, Daehan Jeguk, in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In 1919, the provisional government in exile during the Japanese occupation declared the name of Korea as the Republic of Korea, Daehan Minguk, also in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.  Three Hans  :Main articles: Byeonhan confederacy, Jinhan confederacy, Mahan confederacy The Samhan are generally considered loose confederations of walled-town states. Each appears to have had a ruling elite, whose power was a mix of politics and shamanism. Although each state appears to have had its own ruler, there is no evidence of systematic succession. The name of the poorly understood Jin state continued to be used in the name of the Jinhan confederacy and in the name \\"Byeonjin,\\" an alternate term for Byeonhan. In addition, for some time the leader of Mahan continued to call himself the King of Jin, asserting nominal overlordship over all of the Samhan confederations. Mahan was the largest and earliest developed of the three confederacies. It consisted of 54 minor statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the Baekje Kingdom. Mahan is usually considered to have been located in the southwest of the Korean peninsula, covering Jeolla, Chungcheong, and portions of Gyeonggi. Jinhan consisted of 12 statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the Silla Kingdom. It is usually considered to have been located to the east of the Nakdong River valley. Byeonhan consisted of 12 statelets, which later gave rise to the Gaya confederacy, subsequently annexed by Silla. It is usually considered to have been located in the south and west of the Nakdong River valley.  Geography  The exact locations occupied by the different Samhan confederations are disputed. It is also quite likely that their boundaries changed over time. Samguk Sagi indicates that Mahan was located in the northern region later occupied by Goguryeo, Jinhan in the region later occupied by Silla, and Byeonhan in the southwestern region later occupied by Baekje. However, the earlier Chinese San guo zhi places Mahan in the southwest, Jinhan in the southeast, and Byeonhan between them. Villages were usually constructed deep in high mountain valleys, where they were relatively secure from attack. Mountain fortresses were also often constructed as places of refuge during war. The minor states which made up the federations are usually considered to have covered about as much land as a modern-day myeon, or township. Based on historical and archeological records, river and sea routes appear to have been the primary means of long-distance transportation and trade (Yi, 2001, p. 246). It is thus not surprising that Jinhan and Byeonhan, with their coastal and river locations, became particularly prominent in international trade during this time.  Languages  One of the most prominent leader of the Han (Korean: 한; 韓) Immigration was King Jun of Gojoseon from the northern Korea, having lost the throne to Wiman, fled to the state of Jin in southern Korea around 194 - 180 BC.Gina Lee Barnes,《State Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives》, Psychology Press, 2001, , p.29-33 He and his followers established Mahan which was one of the Samhan (\\"Three Hans\\"), along with Byeonhan and Jinhan. Further Han(韓) migration followed the fall of Gojoseon and establishment of the Chinese commanderies in 108 BC.

The Samhan languages were spoken in the Mahan, Byeonhan and Jinhan. The extent of Han languages are unclear. It is generally accepted as including Sillan, and may also have included Baekje language.  Technology  The Samhan saw the systematic introduction of iron into the southern Korean peninsula. This was taken up with particular intensity by the Byeonhan states of the Nakdong River valley, which manufactured and exported iron armor and weapons throughout Northeast Asia. The introduction of iron technology also facilitated growth in agriculture, as iron tools made the clearing and cultivation of land much easier. It appears that at this time the modern-day Jeolla area emerged as a center of rice production (Kim, 1974).  Relations  Until the rise of Goguryeo, the external relations of Samhan were largely limited to the Chinese commanderies located in the former territory of Gojoseon. The longest standing of these, the Lelang commandery, appear to have maintained separate diplomatic relations with each individual state rather than with the heads of the confederacies as such. In the beginning, the relationship was a political trading system in which \\"tribute\\" was exchanged for titles or prestige gifts. Official seals identified each tribal leader's authority to trade with the commandery. However, after the fall of the Kingdom of Wei in the 3rd century, San guo zhi reports that the Lelang commandery handed out official seals freely to local commoners, no longer symbolizing political authority (Yi, 2001, p. 245). The Chinese commanderies also supplied luxury goods and consumed local products. Later Han dynasty coins and beads are found throughout the Korean peninsula. These were exchanged for local iron or raw silk. After the 2nd century CE, as Chinese influence waned, iron ingots came into use as currency for the trade based around Jinhan and Byeonhan. Trade relations also existed with the emergent states of Japan at this time, most commonly involving the exchange of ornamental Japanese bronzeware for Korean iron. These trade relations shifted in the 3rd century, when the Yamatai federation of Kyūshū gained monopolistic control over Japanese trade with Byeonhan.

A Mellotron-like instrument in the prototype stage and intended for mass production, it was featured on several albums and tours. It appeared in advertisements and received press in several newspapers as the next \\"latest and greatest\\" keyboard instrument. It also received over 1,000 advance orders from many prominent musicians worldwide, including members of The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Despite this success, it is now generally considered the world's rarest keyboard instrument in the genres of pop/rock music. It also retains the highest selling price for any Mellotron related keyboard, and since its inception, has been one of the most difficult to find, seldom seen, and least recorded instruments in the entire world.  Technology  The Birotron is a keyboard instrument that uses 8-track cartridge tapes to play sounds whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard. It is similar in concept to the Chamberlin and Mellotron, and was a forerunner of digital sampling. Keyboards like the Mellotron, Chamberlin, and Birotron were mainly used for strings, choirs, brass, and flutes, sounds not easily reproduced on the synthesizers of that era. The major innovation of the Birotron is that it stores its sounds using 8-track tape loops, which allows it to play the sounds indefinitely, a great improvement from the 8-second limit of the Mellotron and Chamberlin. This also allows for dynamic and gradual changes in sound tones over time. A 10-minute tape loop could start off as a violin sound and gradually thicken into a viola or cello. A single repeating drum sound could gradually morph into several drum tones. Sound effects could change over time from the sounds of a stream to birds chirping. Sound collages could be made by combining tapes of various flutes, cellos, choirs, sound effects etc. This use of tape loops from 8-track cartridges also allows a Birotron owner to record their own tapes, and have a series of multiple instruments across the keyboard in the register they wished. Another improvement is a separate attack and decay envelope for each note (like a VCA on analogue synthesizers) that allowed each note on the keyboard to independently begin and sustain. Notes could come in instantly or gradually over time — swelling in volume over a minute. Notes could decay quickly or slowly fade out, or infinite sustain could be achieved – giving the illusion that the instrument is playing itself. A ten turn pitch knob allows the sounds to be vastly speeded up or slowed down. The drawback was that the actual attack of a note had been lost in this system, and the electronic attack and decay were essential to recreate it. The attack, sustain, and 10 turn pitch features allow for effortless creation of ominous stacked sound swells and pitch bends reminiscent of Mike Pinder's Mellotron work on \\"Have You Heard\\" (1969), and Rick Wakeman's Mellotron work on \\"I Get Up, I Get Down\\" from Close to the Edge (1972). By varying the attack and decay controls while playing — sounds, notes, and chords could be stacked upon, blended, sustained, and then suddenly morphed by changing the 4 position track selector. The keyboard action also allows the user to play as fast as they want to, having a very light touch. This allowed the player to create both a dynamic sound, and do fast runs the way a symphony might actually play. This was not always easy to do with the Mellotron or Chamberlin. These combined features plus a lighter weight and small size attracted huge interest from a large number of prominent rock and pop musicians of that time.  Beginnings  Unable to afford a Mellotron, Dave Biro invented this instrument for personal use in early 1974. When Dave's manager, Ed Cohen first heard the prototype at a Blackwood club engagement, he was stunned – the mixed strings were better than either of the two Mellotrons in Connecticut at the time. Ed arranged to show it to Rick Wakeman in October 1974 after a concert performance in Connecticut. Wakeman played it backstage noting it sounded \\"more mellow than a Mellotron\\", and realizing it allowed for more variety in playing styles because there was no worry about the tape running out. Wakeman was so impressed by the indefinite tape loop idea that he asked Biro if he'd like to \\"make some money with this thing\\" and offered to fund its manufacture. It was developed in 1975 by Birotronics, Ltd which was one of Wakeman's Complex 7 businesses. The Packhorse Road Case company was also part of Complex 7. Demand The Birotron was introduced in advertisements to the music world in 1976. Costing an estimated 1,500-3,000 dollars along with the promise of tapes available cheaply at music stores, it was offered as an alternative to the more expensive (and occasionally unreliable) Mellotron and Chamberlin. Interest and customer orders flooded in from musicians worldwide. These included Keith Emerson (Emerson, Lake & Palmer), Elton John, Rod Argent's music store, Uriah Heep (band), Roger Whittaker, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney, The Beach Boys, Rod Stewart, The Faces, Led Zeppelin, Captain & Tennille, Gary Wright, Dudley Moore, Patrick Moraz, Chicago, Ian McLagan, Synergy, Tangerine Dream, Edgar Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Yes. Over 1000 orders were eventually received for the proposed B-90 model. Various famous musicians visited the factory to see and hear the Birotron. Among these were Dudley Moore, Linda McCartney, and Paul \\"Doc\\" Randall. Christopher Franke of Tangerine Dream ordered one after trying it at the Frankfurt Music Exhibition, and many musicians such as John Lennon, Captain and Tennille, and John Paul Jones sought out Dave Biro or his management to be among the first to obtain one when they realized the demand was high. Many other music business executives such as Guy Barris and Derek Green of A&M; Records also came to see it, some travelling thousands of miles. The market for the Birotron was in some part due to negative experiences musicians had working with the Mellotron and the Chamberlin in a live concert setting. It was thought that having tapes protected inside the 8-track cartridge casings rendered them immune from the effects of humidity, smoke, fog machine residue, and temperature changes. In conversations with Dave Biro and his management, Toni Tennille is alleged to have said: \\"Finally someone has perfected the Mellotron and Chamberlin designs\\".  Production  Despite the skilled talents of the manufacturing team, (such as Emerson/McCartney Moog technician Phil Pearce who worked on the attack / decay electronics), and a man by the name of 'Roger Rogers' who worked on design development, delays in actual production arose due to issues that became time consuming to solve properly. These included international voltage considerations, tape head alignment, and fitting 8-track tapes into a smaller and extremely robust case. The vertical mount of the tape cartridges initially made tapes prone to problems like jamming and wandering. Smaller tape loop lengths helped surmount this. Although the problems were solved it meant that essentially the B-90 Birotron was not made to a price and expensive metals and components were used in its manufacture. Wakeman stated in a 1978 interview with Keyboard magazine that the Birotron would have an extremely low profit margin because of it. The use of expensive components, combined with fees for legal patents (to cover at least two versions of it, and a loop recording process which eliminated thumps in loop points), plus hiring musicians and locations to record sounds for the tapes, made the Birotron project an increasingly expensive venture. The instrument was also made of rather unique parts, as detailed in Dave Biro's Birogram, a 1977 public relations release from Birotronics:  Sound library recordings  An entire orchestral sound library was recorded for the Birotron. These sounds included violin and viola sections, brass, cellos, various flutes, organs, recorders, choirs etc. The London Symphony Orchestra, and Nottingham Town Choirs were involved in making these recordings. Rick Wakeman himself recorded the organ sounds from a church organ both The Rolling Stones and The Who had used. Despite the years of work from 1975 through 1977 and over 1,000 orders from musicians worldwide, no Birotron was ever commercially offered for sale. In the end, only a handful of musicians actually received a Birotron. Among this number were Klaus Schulze with (Earthstar), Tangerine Dream, Rick Wakeman and Dave Biro (who lost one unit after Birotronics went bust and his house was repossessed).  Sounds  It is unclear how many sounds were put onto 8-track tapes for use in the machine. Some sounds that have been found on tapes are 'mixed choir', 'violin', 'organ', 'cello', 'flute', 'viola section', 'mixed strings', and 'mixed brass'. There are probably more as three different versions of the instrument were produced. These sounds (when played from unmagnetized tapes) have characteristics of the Mellotron and Chamberlin, having both brightness and warm mid-range depending on the instrument sound and the analogue recording itself. Physical evidence exists suggesting that there may be no Birotron left at all with a complete, fully working, unmagnetized tape set. Many found tapes and 8-track tape cartridges themselves are so worn, damaged and delicate, that they exist as mere remnants more than functional parts. Birotron replacement tapes were never issued. This rendered any surviving tapes to be worn and eroded by original overuse as far back as the early 1980s. Because of this, and the fact that it was never isolated in any recordings, it is not known for certain what the Birotron sound exactly sounded like. Only one unmagnetized tape set is known to exist and still provide a partially accurate representation of Birotron sounds. This tape set was distributed to Dave Biro by Birotronics managing director Peter Robinson in the late 1970s and never used commercially.  Models  In total, Birotronics made an extremely limited number of these instruments. There were two British made \\"model A\\" versions of Biro's original prototype, along with two prototype versions of the B-90. The B-90 model itself was the \\"pre- production prototype\\" and it's estimated that twelve were made. A mockup - prototype \\"C\\" version funded by Rudkin-Wiley Co. (investors / owners in Pepperidge Farm Foods / Air Shield manufacturing for trucks) came after the Birotronics business bankruptcy in 1979. This model (using some parts from the original prototype and a missing B-90) was never completed due to the 1981 recession in the USA and only one unfinished and incomplete version of this exists.  Number manufactured  No one actually knows for certain how many Birotrons were made. David Biro says only 17 were made, including the original and the four aforementioned prototypes. Rick Wakeman claims there could be no more than 35 (27 unassembled and partially assembled units and only eight complete and assembled working B-90 models). Another ex-Birotronics source believes only 13 B-90 machines were ever assembled. It is unlikely that the mystery of how many were actually made, will ever be solved. Only five Birotrons are thought to exist today, and of that number only two are known to be complete machines. A possible 6th machine may or may not exist. As of 2020, it has not been seen or accounted for in 26 years. Discrepancies are somewhat explained by the fact that parts did exist in Birotronics inventory to make at least 20 machines, and that being in the beta test phase, the serial numbers on the assembled B90's may not have been in sequential order. For example, it's quite possible that the first two B90 pre-production prototypes were considered as #001 and #002 without ever being labelled as such because they were just cabinetless test models. Dave Biro also claims that he received Birotron #008 in 1977, after asking for #007, and then later again received another #008 as a gift in the 1990s after the first #008 had been disposed of during foreclosure of his home. One of the #008 Birotrons may have been intended as #003 or #004. What is known for certain is that no serial number higher than #015 has ever been found.  Renewed interest in 1990s and 2000s  The Birotron had renewed interest in the early 1990s because of its relation to the Mellotron and Chamberlin. Although analogue tape instruments had experienced a rebirth through painstaking restorations, sample library creation, and then widespread use again on records, the whereabouts of surviving Birotrons remained a mystery. Fervent searches by musicians and collectors turned up nothing. Only those with a past history of business involvement with Mellotronics or Birotronics could offer even a tenuous lead on where to locate a Birotron, one person stating having not even heard the word 'Birotron' in almost two decades. In the 1970s two units were destroyed during durability tests. An estimated five were damaged and thrown away, but it is unknown if the two destroyed units were included in this number. In the early 1990s, ex-Birotronics director Peter Robinson disposed of the surviving unbuilt Birotrons, saying regretfully in 2007: \\"At the time I couldn't see them making a comeback ... I never thought there would be any future interest ... if only I knew ...\\" Rick Wakeman also laments the passing of the Birotron saying: \\"I don't have any of them! ... I don't have one. I would like to have one, I must admit, I'd love to have one.\\" Wakeman owned a total of four Birotrons, and used them successfully on the Yes Going for the One and Tormato tours to replace his double Mellotron last used on the Going for the One album. Wakeman recalled in a 1999 interview that two Birotrons were stolen, two were left damaged beyond repair, and one Birotron was sold privately for somewhere between $35,000 and $50,000 ($51,556.56 and $73,652.23 in 2017 dollars). This is the highest recorded price ever paid for a Mellotron-type instrument. It is estimated that only five or six Birotrons are now left in existence and of this number, only two, possibly three (if the third one still exists) are known to be complete machines.  Downfall  Two major factors led to the Birotron's demise. The most direct cause was a lack of necessary and consistent funding. The Birotron also suffered from poor timing. Originally intended for release in the mid-1970s, it was delayed until shortly before the arrival of the digital sampling technology (such as the Fairlight CMI) which would render it immediately obsolete in the eyes of the general consumer-musician. The Birotron's conception in 1974 and association with art and progressive rock, (as opposed to disco, punk, or new wave), plus its use of 8-track tapes at the end of the 1970s, would also position it as a relic of a by-gone era. In addition, Wakeman's resources were also being drained by an ongoing divorce, worsening health problems, and growing dissent within his band Yes.  Attempts to save and rescue Birotron  In the late 1970s, and into the 1980s, Les Bradley (managing director of the Mellotron company) offered to help save the Birotron through a mutual hybrid manufacturing operation but the offer came too late. Birotronics had abandoned the idea of any commercial production as funds had run too short and it was estimated the Birotron could now never compete in the marketplace against digital synth technology. Not wanting to give up, David Biro (who years earlier returned to the USA after signing over all Birotron production to Birotronics UK), attempted to sustain the Birotron project by designing another model that overcame the lengthy manufacturing challenges in the British versions and might be more viable. This \\"model C\\" version (the Birotron Polyvox) invested in by Rudkin-Wiley (Pepperidge Farm Foods and Air Shield products), used fewer 8-track tapes, had new sounds, and would have included digital technology, and a remote keyboard that connected to the machine, but sustained funding was not available due to the 1981 recession. Throughout 1981, the recession worsened and funds for the project had completely drained. Dave Biro was left homeless and on the streets by Christmas 1982. Dave Biro explains in the documentary movie Mellodrama (2008): \\"I couldn't even afford bankruptcy after I lost my home and everything, and that, as far as I was concerned, was pretty much the end of the Birotron.\\"  \\"World's rarest musical instrument\\"  Both Rick Wakeman and David Biro were financially ruined during the project as an estimated £50,000 (upwards of £322,500 today) disappeared into it. Today the Birotron is considered most likely the \\"world's rarest musical instrument\\" - being intended for factory mass production, having been used successfully on records and tours, but now - so extremely few in number and impossible to find as noted in a 2007 Believer Magazine article. Birotronics USA director of sales and marketing, Ed Cohen states that even back in the 1970s he never even saw any B-90 Birotrons himself, and that he used flyers and descriptions of the machine when making sales presentations in America. By 1979, some American keyboardists and music industry professionals, still enticed by the 1976/1977 ads for the Birotron, had begun quests looking for it through business management and sales agents, and in music stores around the country, only to be told nothing had come in or had ever been seen. Concerned about what was happening, A&M; Records business executive Derek Green journeyed to the Birotron factory to personally ask Rick Wakeman \\"What's happened to the Birotron?\\" In a 1979 issue of Keyboard magazine, the constant frustrated question of when and where can musicians get a Birotron? was listed as the most 'Frequently Asked Question' to editors of the magazine. Rick Wakeman also comments on the Birotron in a 2010 interview with Metal Discovery saying \\"They are unbelievably collectable; they really are.\\" EarthStar's keyboardist Craig Wuest also comments on the sound in a 2010 Hartford Courant interview saying \\"I was taken by the Birotron because it doesn't sound like anything else, it just doesn't.\\" The Birotron's designation as the \\"world's rarest musical instrument\\" would not be only for the 5 or 6 surviving units (of which only 2 are known completed instruments), but also because its rarity was caused by natural circumstances and not artificial low production as an intended collectable. It is also the only sole instrument within its own \\"technology type\\" - a tape loop keyboard instrument, (unlike the Mellotron and Chamberlin which used finite lengths of tape.) The Birotron also likely remains the only instrument in the world with an entire sound library that's never been digitally salvaged. Four sounds have emerged as digital samples from a surviving Birotron, but all are of extremely poor quality, being taken from partially erased and magnetized 8-track tapes playing at the wrong speed. With only four incomplete sound samples from faulty tapes playing at incorrect motor speeds (due to improper settings of the 10-turn pitch knob), accurate software-based Birotron sounds continue to remain unobtainable for musicians. Only the surviving original Birotrons with some assembly of unused or unmagnetized (clear sounding) tapes are considered representative. Just one incomplete and unmagnetized tape set now exists. This tape set was originally distributed by Birotronics UK managing director Peter Robinson to David Biro in the mid-1970s and restored over a two-year period for use in a Birotron demonstration video. The surviving tape set is a worn but lone example of sounds that were never otherwise distributed or used commercially despite Rick Wakeman's direct involvement and plans for them. Streetly Electronics has a tape set available that features the Birotron Choir which is substantially better than any digital samples offered so far, though it's a post-2000 creation for use in Mellotrons, and does not represent or resemble the Birotron B90 sound.  Birotron use in concerts  Dave Biro and Rick Wakeman are the only known confirmed musicians to use the instrument live. Dave Biro used the original prototype with his band Blackwood from 1974 to 1976. Rick Wakeman used three or four B-90 models throughout 1977 and 1978 for the Yes Going for the One, and Tormato tours. It was also allegedly used during Tangerine Dream's 1978 Cyclone tour. It has not been seen in a live concert since 1979, but a Central New York keyboardist, Carl Goodhines, used it live periodically with his band, 'Terror Firma, in the mid 1980s, performing local shows. The Birotron used was on loan from one of the band's friends, Craig Wuest, of Earthstar fame. Wuest explained he was given the B-90 by Klaus Schulze of Tangerine Dream. This Birotron later found itself among a collection of rare keyboards belonging to a New York recording studio owner who later sold it and many other rare pieces to a collector in England.  Birotron recordings  The Birotron B90 model was only ever known to be used on record by three bands in its heyday. The first musician to use it in a commercial recording was Rick Wakeman. The Birotron appeared on the Yes albums Tormato (1978, deep and compressed in the mix), the live Yesshows (1980), and Wakeman's solo album Criminal Record (1977). It also appears on three albums by the band Earthstar: French Skyline (1979), Atomkraft? Nein, Danke! (1981), and Humans Only (1982). The Birotron also appears on two Tangerine Dream albums: Force Majeure (1979, featuring the male choir and violin sounds throughout the album), and Hyperborea (1983) showcasing the male choir sound again. This is likely the most audible recording of the Birotron male choir and would also be historically notable for being the very last recorded appearance of this sound. These were the only known appearances of Birotron on record during its era. The Birotron (now suffering deteriorated sound due to tape damage) re-appeared once again 11 years later on the track \\"Lift\\" by Dave Kean on the obscure 1993 Mellotron tribute: The Rime of the Ancient Sampler. The exact same Birotron unit (#007) also appeared once more 7 years later on the song \\"Nickel Plated Man\\" by Eleni Mandell on the 1999 album Wishbone. Recordings of Biro's original prototype and the later model C version remain unreleased, or are now non-existent, and no further appearances of any Birotron have appeared since. Essentially, the Birotron has made just two known reappearances in almost 35 years. Serial numbers of three units have been historically traced to recordings: #005 (formerly owned by Christopher Franke of Tangerine Dream), #007 (formerly owned by Wakeman), and #006 (Earthstar). It is also highly possible (but unconfirmed) that the Earthstar Birotron appears on Klaus Schulze's 1977 Mirage album, doing the endless choir sounds in \\"Velvet Voyage\\" and \\"Crystal Lake\\". The Birotron is not credited on the record but Earthstar's Craig Wuest claims the rich choir sounds are indeed an undocumented Birotron recording. Other possible (though unconfirmed) recordings include Kurt Memo's single \\"Piano Bar\\" which was recorded in Germany around the same time. It is unknown for certain if Tangerine Dream - \\"Loop Mellotron\\" (credited to Christopher Franke) on the late 1970s albums Stratosfear (1976) and Cyclone (1978) is a reference to Birotron #005 or to their Mellotron T550 model which contained looped tapes they made themselves. The Mellotron T550 model was apparently manufactured from 1981 to 1983. If the manufacturing dates are accurate then the Birotron is the \\"Loop Mellotron\\". Lastly the Birotron appears on the Mellodrama (2008) movie documentary soundtrack with two well-worn but worthwhile 1970s progressive rock era recordings made by inventor Dave Biro. The Birotron's looped sounds can be described as somewhat similar to the sounds of the Orchestron and keyboard section of the Optigan but have a far cleaner Mellotron- or Chamberlin-like timbre because of the tapes. The unique attack and decay systems for each individual note and the ten turn pitch knob (for changing tape speed) make Birotron sounds shimmering, haunting, and occasionally unrecognizable in the very few recordings that feature it. Because of this ability to morph and change the tonal qualities of the taped instruments, and the fact it's impossibly rare, most people would not usually recognize the sound of a Birotron when they heard it. No audio demonstration of each Birotron sound was ever known to exist. Despite the Birotron's reputation for being enigmatic and elusive, the instrument and its history continues to fascinate and intrigue musicians, historians, and writers, appearing as a feature in major magazine and newspaper articles as well as a recent documentary on the Mellotron and Chamberlin.

PDF The structure was originally called the Weaubleau- Osceola structure after Weaubleau Creek and Osceola. It is now known as the Weaubleau structure. Because the site was covered by later Pennsylvanian Period sediments, and only partially exposed to erosion relatively recently, its structure is well preserved, and its age can be determined with fair accuracy. It is one of a series of known or suspected impact sites along the 38th parallel in the states of Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. These 38th parallel structures are thought to possibly be the result of a serial impact, similar to that of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter, an extremely unlikely event on Earth. The argument for a serial strike would be greatly strengthened if the ages of the other 38th parallel structures could be constrained to the same period as the Weaubleau structure. The Weaubleau structure is one of the fifty largest known impact craters on earth and the fourth largest in the United States. The three larger ones in the US either have been glaciated and buried (Manson crater), are under water (Chesapeake Bay crater), or have been subjected to orogeny (Beaverhead crater). Therefore, the Weaubleau structure is the largest exposed untectonized impact crater in the US. Round rocks One of the \\"round rocks\\" found in Osceola Long thought to be a glacial remnant, these conglomerate rocks are found in the area of the Weaubleau structure. They are nearly perfectly round, and are referred to locally simply as, \\"geodes,\\" \\"round rocks\\",\\"Missouri rock balls\\" or \\"Weaubleau eggs\\". It has been suggested that the round rocks are chert concretions or nodules. The round rocks may have formed when the impact threw shale clasts of Northview Formation away from the center of the crater and subsequent silica-saturated waters precipitated silica around the shale clasts. Formation of the round rocks is poorly understood and requires further research. See also *38th parallel structures *List of possible impact structures on Earth References Further reading *Evans, K.

Plot summary American archaeologist Martin Padway is visiting the Pantheon in Rome in 1938. A thunderstorm arrives, lightning cracks, and he finds himself transported to Rome in the year 535 AD. At this time, the Italian Peninsula is under the rule of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths. The novel depicts their rule as a relatively benevolent despotism, allowing freedom of religion and maintaining the urban Roman society they had conquered, though slavery is common and torture is the normal method of interrogation by what passes for law-enforcement agencies. In the real timeline, the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire temporarily expanded westwards, embarking on what came to be known as the Gothic War (535–554). They overthrew the Ostrogoths and the Vandals in North Africa, but this war devastated the Italian urbanized society that required the support of intensive agriculture and by the end of the conflict Italy was severely depopulated: its population is estimated to have decreased from 7 million to 2.5 million people. The great cities of Roman times were abandoned and the Byzantines never fully consolidated their rule over Italy, which faced further invasions by the Lombards; Italy fell into a long period of decline. Some historians consider this the true beginning of the Dark Ages in Italy. The city of Rome was besieged three times and many of its inhabitants did not survive to the end of the war. Thus Padway, finding himself in this Rome and knowing what the near future holds in store, must act not only to preserve the future of civilization, but to improve his personal chances of survival. Padway initially wonders whether he is dreaming or delusional, but he quickly accepts his fate and sets out to survive. As an archaeologist, he has enough understanding of various devices used before his time but after the sixth century to be able to reproduce them by the means available. He can speak both modern Italian and Classical Latin, and quickly learns enough Vulgar Latin (which was spoken at that time) to communicate effectively. Most crucially, Padway had read with great attention the book of the historian Procopius, who described the very war at whose outset Padway finds himself. Though not in possession of a physical copy of Procopius when hurled back in time, Padway had memorized his book in great detail, down to the precise details of the time and route of the various armies' moves and their tactical and strategic considerations, as well as the convoluted and violent power struggles of the various contenders for the Gothic Kingship. Thus Padway, in effect, knows the direct, immediate future of the country where he lives and often of individual people whom he meets (at least, until he acts in a way that changes that future). In addition to this specialized and uniquely useful knowledge of the current war, Padway had taken a general interest in military history, which he would eventually be able to put to very practical purposes. Padway's first idea, after he concludes that it is no illusion and that he is truly in the past, is to make a copper still and sell brandy for a living. He convinces a banker, Thomasus the Syrian, to lend him seed money to start his endeavor. He teaches his clerks Arabic numerals and double entry bookkeeping. Padway eventually develops a printing press, issues newspapers, and builds a crude semaphore telegraph system utilizing small telescopes. However, his attempts to reproduce mechanical clocks, gunpowder and cannons are failures. He becomes increasingly involved in the politics of the state as Italy is invaded by the Imperials and also threatened from the south and east. Padway rescues the recently deposed Thiudahad and becomes his quaestor. He uses the king's support to gather forces to defeat the formidable Imperial general Belisarius. Padway manages to surprise Belisarius with tactics never used in the ancient world. Then, deceiving the Dalmatian army, Padway reinstates the senile Thiudahad and imprisons King Wittigis as a hostage. In 537, when Wittigis is killed and Thiudahad descends into madness, Padway has a protégé of his (Urias) married off to Mathaswentha, then crowned king of the Ostrogoths. He also tricks Justinian I into releasing Belisarius from his oath of allegiance and quickly enlists the military genius to command an army against the Franks. The landing of an Imperial army at Vibo, led by Bloody John, and a rebellion, led by the son of Thiudahad, threaten the Ostrogothic kingdom and its army is destroyed at Crathis Valley. Padway assembles a new force, spreads an \\"emancipation proclamation\\" to the Italian serfs and recalls Belisarius after his defeat of the Franks. The armies clash near Calatia and then Benevento. Despite the lack of discipline of his Gothic forces, some simple tactical tricks and the nick-of-time arrival of Belisarius secure Padway's victory. At the end of the novel Padway has stabilized the Italo-Gothic kingdom, introduced a constitution, arranged the end of serfdom, and liberated the Burgunds, and is having boats built for an Atlantic expedition (Padway wants tobacco). The king of the Visigoths has appointed Urias as his heir, reunifying the Goths. Ultimately, due to Padway's actions, Europe will not experience what Age of Enlightenment thinkers retroactively called the Dark Ages: \\"darkness will not fall\\".

Related works Direct responses to this story include the stories \\"The Deadly Mission of Phineas Snodgrass\\" by Frederik Pohl,Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories (Arc Manor, 2011) - publisher's blurb. and \\"The Man Who Came Early\\" by Poul Anderson.Silver, Steven H. \\"The Best Time Travel Stories of All Time, edited by Barry M. Malzberg\\" (2003 review). In the Pohl tale, a man travels back to 1 BC and teaches modern medicine, causing a population explosion. It ends with the fantastically overpopulated alternate timeline sending someone back to assassinate the title character, allowing darkness to fall for thankful billions. It was reprinted in Harry Turtledove's 2005 tribute anthology honoring L. Sprague de Camp, The Enchanter Completed and the 2011 anthology Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories. The Anderson piece is a tale of an American airman sent by a storm (like Padway) to Saga Age Iceland; the story deals with the effect of his innovations. A short story sequel to Lest Darkness Fall, \\"The Apotheosis of Martin Padway\\", written by S. M. Stirling, also appeared in Turtledove's The Enchanter Completed and Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories. It offers glimpses of what might have become of the reality Padway altered, both during his old age and a few hundred years later. Another story inspired by Lest Darkness Fall is \\"To Bring The Light\\", by David Drake, published together with the original in the 1996 Baen double Lest Darkness Fall and To Bring The Light and the 2011 anthology Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories. This story features Flavia Herosilla, a well-educated woman living in ancient Rome at its height. Like Padway, she is sent back in time by a lightning strike, in her case to the era of Rome's beginnings around 751 BC. Unlike Padway, who tries to change history, Flavia tries to recreate the founding of Rome based on the legends that she knows. But there is one detail she does want to change. The legends tell that on the day of Rome's founding, Romulus killed his brother Remus - and while in the process of making sure that Rome will be founded, Flavia Herosilla had fallen in love with Remus... Several editions of Lest Darkness Fall, including the one printed with \\"To Bring the Light\\", repeat an error in the sequence where Padway and Julia from Apulia are setting up their one night stand: in the original text a somewhat inebriated Padway says Julia's dirty feet form a barrier and \\"I must lave the pedal extremities...\\". Apparently some editor failed to recognize \\"lave\\" as a synonym for \\"wash\\" and turned the word into \\"have.\\" Reception Jo Walton wrote, \\"In 1939, L. Sprague de Camp came up with one of the wonderful ideas of science fiction, the man taken out of his time to a time of lower technology... As soon as Padway’s there, he puts his head down and starts to concentrate on what makes these books such fun—improvising technology from what he knows and can find around him. Padway starts with distilling and double-entry bookkeeping and makes his way up to newspapers and heliographs... The more you know history, the more you can see how clever the book is... De Camp was a historian of technology. His The Ancient Engineers (1963) is a... fascinating non-fiction book.\\"\\"Has Queen Amalasuntha Been Assassinated Yet? L. Sprague de Camp’s Lest Darkness Fall\\" – book review by Jo Walton Stating that it \\"is an excellent introduction to Rome at the time of the Gothic invasion\\", Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Lest Darkness Fall as an example of how science fiction \\"can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader\\". Boucher and McComas praised the novel as \\"a witty version of the Connecticut Yankee theme, distinguished by its lore of Gothic Rome.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, February 1950, p.106 Algis Budrys termed it \\"marvelous,\\" rating it as \\"Maybe the best [book] DeCamp ever wrote.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, January 1984, p. 31.

Fraser also wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation. The film version follows the storyline of the original play fairly closely: a gay man and his heterosexual, female roommate try to find love and sexual gratification in Edmonton, as a serial killer is loose in the city. While the film was shot on location in Montreal, Quebec, the original stage play and the screenplay are both set in Edmonton, Alberta. There are attempts made in the dialogue, props and background film footage to identify the city as Edmonton, as in David's remark, \\"Let's order a Rosebowl pizza and discuss your sexual crises\\" (Rose Bowl Pizza is a well-known restaurant and bar in Edmonton). In another scene, the TV news reporter signs off from \\"CFR-\\" and gets cut off by the TV remote control before she can say \\"-N\\", the final call letter of Edmonton's CTV affiliate station. Sal's remark, \\"It's chicken night at Flash\\", is an allusion to Flashbacks, a long-gone Edmonton gay bar. There's also repeated use of a Sun newspaper (the Edmonton Sun is one of the city's major daily newspapers, although the city's name is not included in the masthead of the prop paper) and CBC-TV Canadian Football League footage of an Edmonton Eskimos game. Fraser won a Genie Award for his adapted screenplay,William H. New (editor) Brad Fraser while stars Mia Kirshner, Joanne Vannicola and Matthew Ferguson received acting nominations.

Linear genetic programming (LGP) is a particular subset of genetic programming wherein computer programs in a population are represented as a sequence of instructions from imperative programming language or machine language. The graph-based data flow that results from a multiple usage of register contents and the existence of structurally noneffective code (introns) are two main differences of this genetic representation from the more common tree-based genetic programming (TGP) variant.Brameier, M.: \\"On linear genetic programming \\", Dortmund, 2003W.

Foundations of Genetic Programming. Examples of LGP programs Because LGP programs are basically represented by a linear sequence of instructions, they are simpler to read and to operate on than their tree-based counterparts. For example, a simple program written in the LGP language Slash/A looks like a series of instructions separated by a slash: input/ # gets an input from user and saves it to register F 0/ # sets register I = 0 save/ # saves content of F into data vector D[I] (i.e. D[0] := F) input/ # gets another input, saves to F add/ # adds to F current data pointed to by I (i.e. F := F + D[0]) output/. # outputs result from F By representing such code in bytecode format, i.e. as an array of bytes each representing a different instruction, one can make mutation operations simply by changing an element of such an array.

Penguin/Viking) Three Chinese Poets is a book of poetry by the titular poets Wang Wei, Li Bai and Du Fu translated into English by Vikram Seth. The Three Poets were contemporaries and are considered to be amongst the greatest Chinese poets by many later scholars. The three have been described as a Buddhist recluse, a Taoist immortal and a Confucian sage respectively. Though this trichotomy has been criticised as simplistic and artificial, it can act as a guiding approximation. They lived in the Tang Dynasty and the political strife at that time affected all of their lives very much and this impact is evident in the poetry of all three. It is not clear whether Wang Wei and Li Bai ever met, but they had a mutual friend in Meng Haoran. Li Bai and Du Fu did meet and in fact Du Fu greatly admired Li Bai. In the introduction of Three Chinese Poets, Seth talks about the influence of translations on his life and work; that while sometimes he has been so moved by a translation that he learnt another language to read the original, he doubts that he would ever be able to do this as much as he wished to. However, he says that Charles Johnston's translation of Aleksandr Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, Richard Wilbur's translation of Molière's Tartuffe and Robert Fitzgerald's translation of the Iliad have helped him enter worlds without which would have been out of his reach. He states that he avoided the style and philosophy of the famous translations by Ezra Pound which was to read and deeply understand a poem then to create an approximate translation inspired by the original - the judge of the merit being whether the new poem is a good poem in the new language. Instead he wanted to follow the example of the translators mentioned above to retain a greater fidelity and to try to preserve structure such as rhyme. He stresses that while he has tried not to lose meaning, he has often failed, explaining that because each word is much more important in poetry, the problem of losing associations of words is much greater than when translating prose. He also makes note that any satisfaction derived from the tonality of the poems is necessarily lost because of the non-tonality of English.

The term is earliest documented in the Catholic Church since the 5th century, where the Master of Ceremonies was and still is an official of the Papal Court responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elaborate rituals involving the Pope and the sacred liturgy. The master of ceremonies sometimes also refers to the protocol officer during an official state function, especially in monarchies. Today, the term is often used to connote a person who presents performers, speaks to the audience, entertains people, and generally keeps an event moving. This usage occurs in the entertainment industry, for example in reference to television game show hosts, as well as in contemporary hip hop and electronic dance music culture. In addition, the term also exists in various chivalric orders and fraternal orders. Name Sunny Chan, seen with local TVB artists, in the UK as guests' compère for TVB- Europe's Happy Family Gala promo-event Alternative names include compère (for men), commère (for women), host, presenter, announcer, and microphone controller.  Catholic Church  The term originated in the Catholic Church. The Master of Ceremonies is an official of the Papal Court responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elegant and elaborate rituals involving the Pope and the sacred liturgy. He may also be an official involved in the proper conduct of protocols and ceremonials involving the Roman Pontiff, the Papal Court, and other dignitaries and potentates. Examples of official liturgical books prescribing the rules and regulations of liturgical celebrations are Cæremoniale Romanum and Cæremoniale Episcoporum. The office of the Master of Ceremonies itself is very old. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the most ancient ceremonials and rituals of the Catholic Church are the Ordines Romani. Names of Masters of Ceremonies are known since the late Middle Ages (15th century) and the Renaissance (16th century). However, copies of books prescribing the forms of rituals, rites and customs of pontifical ceremonies are known to have been given to Charles Martel in the 8th century. The rules and rituals themselves are known to have been compiled or written by the pontifical masters of ceremonies, dating back to the time of Pope Gelasius I (492–496) with modifications and additions made by Pope Gregory the Great (590–604). It is reasonable to assume that the ceremonials themselves pre-date Gelasius. The duties of the Master of Ceremonies may have developed from the time Emperor Constantine the Great gave the Lateran Palace to the popes (324) or from the time Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire (380), and were no doubt influenced by imperial practices, customs and norms. However, documentary evidence from the late Roman period is scarce or lost. The ceremonies and practices of the Byzantine emperors are also known to have influenced the papal court. The accumulation of elaborations and complications since the Renaissance and Baroque eras continued well into the 20th century, until some of the ceremonies (i.e. the court, the rituals and norms) were simplified or completely eliminated by Pope Paul VI in the 1970s after Vatican II; much of the Renaissance pomp and ceremony has been completely abandoned by the popes of the modern era. At a large Catholic church or cathedral, the Master of Ceremonies organizes and rehearses the proceedings and ritual of each Mass. He may also have responsibility for the physical security of the place of worship during the liturgy. At major festivities such as Christmas and Easter, when the liturgies are long and complex, the Master of Ceremonies plays a vital role in ensuring that everything runs smoothly. The current papal Master of Ceremonies is Monsignor Guido Marini, who succeeded Archbishop Piero Marini (to whom he is not related).  Weddings  During the wedding reception, the multifaceted responsibility of the Master of Ceremony (MC) is to keep the agenda flowing smoothly by: * skillfully capturing and maintaining the attention of the wedding guests * effectively directing their attention on whatever the bride and groom have chosen to include * keeping the wedding attendees informed so at any given moment they know what is happening * comfortably guiding the bride's and groom's friends and family so they know what they are supposed to do to participate The role of the wedding master of ceremonies incorporates a wide range of skills, and those who serve in this capacity have frequently undergone extensive training in the following areas: * Delivering applause cues * Presenting introductions * Microphone technique * Posture and stance * Voice inflection * Staging (theatre) Masters of ceremonies at weddings and private events also ensure the coordination of their event, including liaison with catering staff.  In music and cultural events  In hip hop and electronic dance music, \\"MC\\" refers to rap artists or performers who perform vocals for their own or other artists' original material. Such genres of electronic dance music where MCs perform on are house, drum and bass, and UK garage. = Hip hop = In the late 1970s, the term emcee, MC or M.C. became used for rappers and for their role within hip hop music and culture. Initially, MCs were those who introduced the DJs to the crowd and explained what was taking place during the event. Often these events were parties at locations including clubs or outdoor public spaces. The term is typically used as a term of distinction, referring to an artist with good performance skills.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. xii. = Comedy clubs = In the context of a comedy club, the role of MC is traditionally filled by a \\"compère\\". In any comedy show, the compère is the host of the evening's events, but the precise role and responsibilities will vary depending on the country, venue, and style of event. The compère is usually a working comedian, and whilst they may incorporate elements of their regular set, the role broadly requires a greater level of improvisation – creating a sense of place and community, interacting with the audience, dealing with any hecklers, and encouraging them to focus on the other acts. The compère will normally do longer bits at the start of the show and after any interval, and shorter bits between acts. They may also be required to make announcements, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and bar promotions.  Monarchies  Assyrian master of ceremonies, part of a long tributary scene. Alabaster bas-relief. From Khorsabad, Iraq, c. 710 BCE. Iraq Museum. Persia by Frederic Shoberl, 1828 Historically certain European royal courts maintained senior offices known as Masters of Ceremonies (or some variant thereof), responsible for conducting stately ceremonies such as coronations and receptions of foreign ambassadors. Examples included: * Kingdom of Denmark: Ceremonimester (Office currently held by Colonel Kim Kristensen) http://kongehuset.dk/nyheder/ny-ceremonimester * Spanish Empire: Maestro de Ceremonias * British Empire: Master of the Ceremonies * France: Grand Master of Ceremonies * Japan: Master of CeremoniesImperial Household Agency: Organization and Functions * Russian Empire: see Table of Ranks * Kingdom of Sweden: Grand Master of the Ceremonies * Ottoman Empire: Kapıcıbaşı, literally \\"chief doorkeeper\\" of the Topkapi Palace  Orders  The function is prevalent in the culture of chivalric orders, as well as in more modern fraternal orders, such as Freemasons and Odd Fellows.  Corporate  Most large corporate and association conferences and conventions use an MC to keep the events running smoothly. This role is sometimes performed by someone inside the group but usually by an outside professional expert MC. Their role could include - introducing and thanking speakers, introducing the theme of the conference, facilitating a panel discussion & interviewing guests. Other In some circles the title \\"Master of Ceremonies\\" is also known as \\"Minister of Ceremonies.\\" In the 1940 Disney film Fantasia, Deems Taylor is the film's Master of Ceremonies. In the role-playing game Apocalypse World, the game master is named Master of Ceremonies (MC).

It is located in parts of the independent cities of Chesapeake and Suffolk in Virginia, and the counties of Camden, Gates, and Pasquotank in North Carolina. Description Sketch map of the Great Dismal Swamp in 1807 The Great Dismal Swamp is a southern swamp, the northernmost of many swamps along the Atlantic Ocean's coast, including the Everglades and the Big Cypress in Florida, the Okefenokee of Georgia, the Congress and Four Holes swamps of South Carolina, and some of the Carolina Bays. Essential to the swamp ecosystem are its water resources, native vegetative communities, and varied wildlife species. The Great Dismal Swamp's ecological significance and its wealth of history and lore make it a unique wilderness. It is one of the last large wild areas remaining in the Eastern United States. History The Great Dismal Swamp is in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina between the James River (Norfolk, Virginia) and the Albemarle Sound (Edenton, North Carolina). The original swamp was estimated to be over ; however, human encroachment has destroyed up to 90% of the original swampland. Beginning in the 1660s, an established community of escaped slaves known as the Great Dismal Swamp maroons lived freely within the Great Dismal Swamp. Most maroons settled in mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Maroons were not the only people who lived inside the swamp – some residents had bought their freedom, others were still slaves who lived semi-independently. In addition, some escaped slaves used the swamp as a stop on the Underground Railroad as they made their way further north. Nearby whites often left the maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles. After centuries of logging and other human activities which were devastating to the swamp's ecosystems, in 1973, the Union Camp Corporation donated 49,100 acres (199 km2) of land; the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was officially established by the U.S. Congress through The Dismal Swamp Act of 1974. Today, the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is now just over in size. In 1805, the Dismal Swamp Canal began serving as a commercial highway for timber coming out of the swamp. Today, the canal continues to serve recreational boaters as part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Habitat and wildlife The refuge consists of over of forested wetlands. Lake Drummond, a natural lake, is located in the heart of the swamp. Outside the boundaries of the National Refuge, the state of North Carolina has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is located not only between two states, but also between two eco- regions, allowing for a wide range of plant and animal species. Bald cypress, black gum, maple, Atlantic white cedar, and pine are the predominant tree species found on the refuge and support the wildlife within. Many mammals, including black bears, bobcats, otters, and weasels along with over 70 species of reptiles and amphibians call the swamp home. More than 200 bird species can be seen at the swamp throughout the year, while 96 of those are known to nest on the refuge. The peak influx of neotropical migratory songbirds, such as numerous species of warblers, is from late April to mid-May. Recreation The refuge is open daily during daylight hours. There is no entrance fee. The refuge headquarters, at the western edge of the refuge, is open on weekdays, except national holidays. Visitor activities include birdwatching, photography, hiking, bicycling, boating and canoeing (a boat-launching ramp, offering access to Lake Drummond, is provided onto the Feeder Ditch, at the eastern edge of the refuge), fishing, and deer hunting on parts of the refuge during the designated season. Camping is permitted at a campsite maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers on the feeder ditch canal close to Lake Drummond. Lake Drummond is the middle of activity in the swamp today, though, with many fishermen, sightseers, and boaters. Boat tours are given from the Dismal Swamp Canal, to Lake Drummond. Hiking opportunities include the nearly (wheelchair- accessible) Dismal Town Boardwalk Trail, located on Washington Ditch Road, that winds through part of the swamp habitat; a number of the refuge's unpaved roads that are also open to bicycling; and the Dismal Swamp Canal Trail, an former section of Route 17 converted into a multi-use trail. The Dismal Swamp Canal Trail follows the eastern side of the swamp from a trailhead near Dominion Blvd south to within of the North Carolina border.

That is, a misuse of statistics occurs when a statistical argument asserts a falsehood. In some cases, the misuse may be accidental. In others, it is purposeful and for the gain of the perpetrator. When the statistical reason involved is false or misapplied, this constitutes a statistical fallacy. The false statistics trap can be quite damaging for the quest for knowledge. For example, in medical science, correcting a falsehood may take decades and cost lives. Misuses can be easy to fall into. Professional scientists, even mathematicians and professional statisticians, can be fooled by even some simple methods, even if they are careful to check everything. Scientists have been known to fool themselves with statistics due to lack of knowledge of probability theory and lack of standardization of their tests. Importance Statistics may be a principled means of debate with opportunities for agreement, Porter considered the history of cost-benefit analysis. While this is perhaps more economical than statistical, it is a quantitative decision-making technique considered to be in the statistical domain. but this is true only if the parties agree to a set of rules. Misuses of statistics violate the rules. To put it another way: > False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often > long endure; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, > as every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when > this is done, one path towards error is closed and the road to truth is > often at the same time opened. — Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (1871), > Vol. 2, 385. Definition, limitations and context One usable definition is: \\"Misuse of Statistics: Using numbers in such a manner that – either by intent or through ignorance or carelessness – the conclusions are unjustified or incorrect.\\" The \\"numbers\\" include misleading graphics discussed elsewhere. The term is not commonly encountered in statistics texts and no authoritative definition is known. It is a generalization of lying with statistics which was richly described by examples from statisticians 60 years ago. The definition confronts some problems (some are addressed by the source): #Statistics usually produces probabilities; conclusions are provisional #The provisional conclusions have errors and error rates. Commonly 5% of the provisional conclusions of significance testing are wrong #Statisticians are not in complete agreement on ideal methods #Statistical methods are based on assumptions which are seldom fully met #Data gathering is usually limited by ethical, practical and financial constraints. How to Lie with Statistics acknowledges that statistics can legitimately take many forms. Whether the statistics show that a product is \\"light and economical\\" or \\"flimsy and cheap\\" can be debated whatever the numbers. Some object to the substitution of statistical correctness for moral leadership (for example) as an objective. Assigning blame for misuses is often difficult because scientists, pollsters, statisticians and reporters are often employees or consultants. An insidious misuse(?) of statistics is completed by the listener/observer/audience/juror. The supplier provides the \\"statistics\\" as numbers or graphics (or before/after photographs), allowing the consumer to draw (possibly unjustified or incorrect) conclusions. The poor state of public statistical literacy and the non-statistical nature of human intuition permits misleading without explicitly producing faulty conclusions. The definition is weak on the responsibility of the consumer of statistics. A historian listed over 100 fallacies in a dozen categories including those of generalization and those of causation. A few of the fallacies are explicitly or potentially statistical including sampling, statistical nonsense, statistical probability, false extrapolation, false interpolation and insidious generalization. All of the technical/mathematical problems of applied probability would fit in the single listed fallacy of statistical probability. Many of the fallacies could be coupled to statistical analysis, allowing the possibility of a false conclusion flowing from a blameless statistical analysis. An example use of statistics is in the analysis of medical research. The process includes In this article anything less than the best statistical practice is equated to the potential misuse of statistics. In a few pages 47 potential statistical errors are discussed; errors in study design, data analysis, documentation, presentation and interpretation. \\"[S]tatisticians should be involved early in study design, as mistakes at this point can have major repercussions, negatively affecting all subsequent stages of medical research.\\" Contains a rich list of medical misuses of statistics of all types. experimental planning, the conduct of the experiment, data analysis, drawing the logical conclusions and presentation/reporting. The report is summarized by the popular press and by advertisers. Misuses of statistics can result from problems at any step in the process. The statistical standards ideally imposed on the scientific report are much different than those imposed on the popular press and advertisers; however, cases exist of advertising disguised as science. The definition of the misuse of statistics is weak on the required completeness of statistical reporting. The opinion is expressed that newspapers must provide at least the source for the statistics reported. Simple causes Many misuses of statistics occur because * The source is a subject matter expert, not a statistics expert. The source may incorrectly use a method or interpret a result. * The source is a statistician, not a subject matter expert. An expert should know when the numbers being compared describe different things. Numbers change, as reality does not, when legal definitions or political boundaries change. * The subject being studied is not well defined. While IQ tests are available and numeric it is difficult to define what they measure; Intelligence is an elusive concept. Publishing \\"impact\\" has the same problem. Scientific papers and scholarly journals are often rated by \\"impact\\" - the number of times cited by later publications. Mathematicians and statisticians conclude that impact (while relatively objective) is not a very meaningful measure. \\"The sole reliance on citation data provides at best an incomplete and often shallow understanding of research—an understanding that is valid only when reinforced by other judgments. Numbers are not inherently superior to sound judgments.\\" A seemingly simple question about the number of words in the English language immediately encounters questions about archaic forms, accounting for prefixes and suffixes, multiple definitions of a word, variant spellings, dialects, fanciful creations (like ectoplastistics from ectoplasm and statistics), technical vocabulary... * Data quality is poor. Apparel provides an example. People have a wide range of sizes and body shapes. It is obvious that apparel sizing must be multidimensional. Instead it is complex in unexpected ways. Some apparel is sold by size only (with no explicit consideration of body shape), sizes vary by country and manufacturer and some sizes are deliberately misleading. While sizes are numeric, only the crudest of statistical analyses is possible using the size numbers with care. * The popular press has limited expertise and mixed motives. This Australian report on crime statistics provides numerous examples of interpreting and misinterpreting the data. \\"The increase in media access to information about crime has not been matched by an increase in the quality of media reporting on crime. The misuse of crime statistics by the media has impeded rational debate about law and order.\\" Among the alleged media abuses: selective use of data, selective reporting of facts, misleading commentary, misrepresentation of facts and misleading headlines. Police and politicians also abused the statistics. If the facts are not \\"newsworthy\\" (which may require exaggeration) they may not be published. The motives of advertisers are even more mixed. * \\"Politicians use statistics in the same way that a drunk uses lamp-posts—for support rather than illumination\\" – Andrew Lang (WikiQuote) \\"What do we learn from these two ways of looking at the same numbers? We learn that a clever propagandist, right or left, can almost always find a way to present the data on economic growth that seems to support her case. And we therefore also learn to take any statistical analysis from a strongly political source with handfuls of salt.\\" The term statistics originates from numbers generated for and utilized by the state. Good government may require accurate numbers, but popular government may require supportive numbers (not necessarily the same). \\"The use and misuse of statistics by governments is an ancient art.\\" Types of misuse =Discarding unfavorable observations= All a company has to do to promote a neutral (useless) product is to find or conduct, for example, 40 studies with a confidence level of 95%. If the product is really useless, this would on average produce one study showing the product was beneficial, one study showing it was harmful and thirty-eight inconclusive studies (38 is 95% of 40). This tactic becomes more effective the more studies there are available. Organizations that do not publish every study they carry out, such as tobacco companies denying a link between smoking and cancer, anti-smoking advocacy groups and media outlets trying to prove a link between smoking and various ailments, or miracle pill vendors, are likely to use this tactic. Ronald Fisher considered this issue in his famous lady tasting tea example experiment (from his 1935 book, The Design of Experiments). Regarding repeated experiments he said, \\"It would clearly be illegitimate, and would rob our calculation of its basis, if unsuccessful results were not all brought into the account.\\" Another term related to this concept is cherry picking. =Ignoring important features= Multivariable datasets have two or more features/dimensions. If too few of these features are chosen for analysis (for example, if just one feature is chosen and simple linear regression is performed instead of multiple linear regression), the results can be misleading. This leaves the analyst vulnerable to any of various statistical paradoxes, or in some (not all) cases false causality as below. =Loaded questions= The answers to surveys can often be manipulated by wording the question in such a way as to induce a prevalence towards a certain answer from the respondent. For example, in polling support for a war, the questions: *Do you support the attempt by the US to bring freedom and democracy to other places in the world? *Do you support the unprovoked military action by the USA? will likely result in data skewed in different directions, although they are both polling about the support for the war. A better way of wording the question could be \\"Do you support the current US military action abroad?\\" A still more nearly neutral way to put that question is \\"What is your view about the current US military action abroad?\\" The point should be that the person being asked has no way of guessing from the wording what the questioner might want to hear. Another way to do this is to precede the question by information that supports the \\"desired\\" answer. For example, more people will likely answer \\"yes\\" to the question \\"Given the increasing burden of taxes on middle- class families, do you support cuts in income tax?\\" than to the question \\"Considering the rising federal budget deficit and the desperate need for more revenue, do you support cuts in income tax?\\" The proper formulation of questions can be very subtle. The responses to two questions can vary dramatically depending on the order in which they are asked. \\"A survey that asked about 'ownership of stock' found that most Texas ranchers owned stock, though probably not the kind traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\\" =Overgeneralization= Overgeneralization is a fallacy occurring when a statistic about a particular population is asserted to hold among members of a group for which the original population is not a representative sample. For example, suppose 100% of apples are observed to be red in summer. The assertion \\"All apples are red\\" would be an instance of overgeneralization because the original statistic was true only of a specific subset of apples (those in summer), which is not expected to be representative of the population of apples as a whole. A real-world example of the overgeneralization fallacy can be observed as an artifact of modern polling techniques, which prohibit calling cell phones for over-the-phone political polls. As young people are more likely than other demographic groups to lack a conventional \\"landline\\" phone, a telephone poll that exclusively surveys responders of calls landline phones, may cause the poll results to undersample the views of young people, if no other measures are taken to account for this skewing of the sampling. Thus, a poll examining the voting preferences of young people using this technique may not be a perfectly accurate representation of young peoples' true voting preferences as a whole without overgeneralizing, because the sample used excludes young people that carry only cell phones, who may or may not have voting preferences that differ from the rest of the population. Overgeneralization often occurs when information is passed through nontechnical sources, in particular mass media. =Biased samples= Scientists have learned at great cost that gathering good experimental data for statistical analysis is difficult. Example: The placebo effect (mind over body) is very powerful. 100% of subjects developed a rash when exposed to an inert substance that was falsely called poison ivy while few developed a rash to a \\"harmless\\" object that really was poison ivy. Researchers combat this effect by double-blind randomized comparative experiments. Statisticians typically worry more about the validity of the data than the analysis. This is reflected in a field of study within statistics known as the design of experiments. Pollsters have learned at great cost that gathering good survey data for statistical analysis is difficult. The selective effect of cellular telephones on data collection (discussed in the Overgeneralization section) is one potential example; If young people with traditional telephones are not representative, the sample can be biased. Sample surveys have many pitfalls and require great care in execution. One effort required almost 3000 telephone calls to get 1000 answers. The simple random sample of the population \\"isn't simple and may not be random.\\" =Misreporting or misunderstanding of estimated error= If a research team wants to know how 300 million people feel about a certain topic, it would be impractical to ask all of them. However, if the team picks a random sample of about 1000 people, they can be fairly certain that the results given by this group are representative of what the larger group would have said if they had all been asked. This confidence can actually be quantified by the central limit theorem and other mathematical results. Confidence is expressed as a probability of the true result (for the larger group) being within a certain range of the estimate (the figure for the smaller group). This is the \\"plus or minus\\" figure often quoted for statistical surveys. The probability part of the confidence level is usually not mentioned; if so, it is assumed to be a standard number like 95%. The two numbers are related. If a survey has an estimated error of ±5% at 95% confidence, it also has an estimated error of ±6.6% at 99% confidence. ±x% at 95% confidence is always ±1.32x% at 99% confidence for a normally distributed population. The smaller the estimated error, the larger the required sample, at a given confidence level. at 95.4% confidence: ±1% would require 10,000 people. ±2% would require 2,500 people. ±3% would require 1,111 people. ±4% would require 625 people. ±5% would require 400 people. ±10% would require 100 people. ±20% would require 25 people. ±25% would require 16 people. ±50% would require 4 people. People may assume, because the confidence figure is omitted, that there is a 100% certainty that the true result is within the estimated error. This is not mathematically correct. Many people may not realize that the randomness of the sample is very important. In practice, many opinion polls are conducted by phone, which distorts the sample in several ways, including exclusion of people who do not have phones, favoring the inclusion of people who have more than one phone, favoring the inclusion of people who are willing to participate in a phone survey over those who refuse, etc. Non-random sampling makes the estimated error unreliable. On the other hand, people may consider that statistics are inherently unreliable because not everybody is called, or because they themselves are never polled. People may think that it is impossible to get data on the opinion of dozens of millions of people by just polling a few thousands. This is also inaccurate. A poll with perfect unbiased sampling and truthful answers has a mathematically determined margin of error, which only depends on the number of people polled. However, often only one margin of error is reported for a survey. When results are reported for population subgroups, a larger margin of error will apply, but this may not be made clear. For example, a survey of 1000 people may contain 100 people from a certain ethnic or economic group. The results focusing on that group will be much less reliable than results for the full population. If the margin of error for the full sample was 4%, say, then the margin of error for such a subgroup could be around 13%. There are also many other measurement problems in population surveys. The problems mentioned above apply to all statistical experiments, not just population surveys. =False causality= When a statistical test shows a correlation between A and B, there are usually six possibilities: # A causes B. # B causes A. # A and B both partly cause each other. # A and B are both caused by a third factor, C. # B is caused by C which is correlated to A. # The observed correlation was due purely to chance. The sixth possibility can be quantified by statistical tests that can calculate the probability that the correlation observed would be as large as it is just by chance if, in fact, there is no relationship between the variables. However, even if that possibility has a small probability, there are still the five others. If the number of people buying ice cream at the beach is statistically related to the number of people who drown at the beach, then nobody would claim ice cream causes drowning because it's obvious that it isn't so. (In this case, both drowning and ice cream buying are clearly related by a third factor: the number of people at the beach). This fallacy can be used, for example, to prove that exposure to a chemical causes cancer. Replace \\"number of people buying ice cream\\" with \\"number of people exposed to chemical X\\", and \\"number of people who drown\\" with \\"number of people who get cancer\\", and many people will believe you. In such a situation, there may be a statistical correlation even if there is no real effect. For example, if there is a perception that a chemical site is \\"dangerous\\" (even if it really isn't) property values in the area will decrease, which will entice more low-income families to move to that area. If low-income families are more likely to get cancer than high-income families (this can happen for many reasons, such as a poorer diet or less access to medical care) then rates of cancer will go up, even though the chemical itself is not dangerous. It is believed that this is exactly what happened with some of the early studies showing a link between EMF (electromagnetic fields) from power lines and cancer. Cites: In well-designed studies, the effect of false causality can be eliminated by assigning some people into a \\"treatment group\\" and some people into a \\"control group\\" at random, and giving the treatment group the treatment and not giving the control group the treatment. In the above example, a researcher might expose one group of people to chemical X and leave a second group unexposed. If the first group had higher cancer rates, the researcher knows that there is no third factor that affected whether a person was exposed because he controlled who was exposed or not, and he assigned people to the exposed and non-exposed groups at random. However, in many applications, actually doing an experiment in this way is either prohibitively expensive, infeasible, unethical, illegal, or downright impossible. For example, it is highly unlikely that an IRB would accept an experiment that involved intentionally exposing people to a dangerous substance in order to test its toxicity. The obvious ethical implications of such types of experiments limit researchers' ability to empirically test causation. =Proof of the null hypothesis= In a statistical test, the null hypothesis (H_0) is considered valid until enough data proves it wrong. Then H_0 is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (H_A) is considered to be proven as correct. By chance this can happen, although H_0 is true, with a probability denoted alpha (the significance level). This can be compared to the judicial process, where the accused is considered innocent (H_0) until proven guilty (H_A) beyond reasonable doubt (alpha). But if data does not give us enough proof to reject that H_0, this does not automatically prove that H_0 is correct. If, for example, a tobacco producer wishes to demonstrate that its products are safe, it can easily conduct a test with a small sample of smokers versus a small sample of non-smokers. It is unlikely that any of them will develop lung cancer (and even if they do, the difference between the groups has to be very big in order to reject H_0). Therefore, it is likely—even when smoking is dangerous—that our test will not reject H_0. If H_0 is accepted, it does not automatically follow that smoking is proven harmless. The test has insufficient power to reject H_0, so the test is useless and the value of the \\"proof\\" of H_0 is also null. This can—using the judicial analogue above—be compared with the truly guilty defendant who is released just because the proof is not enough for a guilty verdict. This does not prove the defendant's innocence, but only that there is not proof enough for a guilty verdict. \\"...the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only in order to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis.\\" (Fisher in The Design of Experiments) Many reasons for confusion exist including the use of double negative logic and terminology resulting from the merger of Fisher's \\"significance testing\\" (where the null hypothesis is never accepted) with \\"hypothesis testing\\" (where some hypothesis is always accepted). =Confusing statistical significance with practical significance= Statistical significance is a measure of probability; practical significance is a measure of effect. A baldness cure is statistically significant if a sparse peach-fuzz usually covers the previously naked scalp. The cure is practically significant when a hat is no longer required in cold weather and the barber asks how much to take off the top. The bald want a cure that is both statistically and practically significant; It will probably work and if it does, it will have a big hairy effect. Scientific publication often requires only statistical significance. This has led to complaints (for the last 50 years) that statistical significance testing is a misuse of statistics. =Data dredging= Data dredging is an abuse of data mining. In data dredging, large compilations of data are examined in order to find a correlation, without any pre-defined choice of a hypothesis to be tested. Since the required confidence interval to establish a relationship between two parameters is usually chosen to be 95% (meaning that there is a 95% chance that the relationship observed is not due to random chance), there is thus a 5% chance of finding a correlation between any two sets of completely random variables. Given that data dredging efforts typically examine large datasets with many variables, and hence even larger numbers of pairs of variables, spurious but apparently statistically significant results are almost certain to be found by any such study. Note that data dredging is a valid way of finding a possible hypothesis but that hypothesis must then be tested with data not used in the original dredging. The misuse comes in when that hypothesis is stated as fact without further validation. \\"You cannot legitimately test a hypothesis on the same data that first suggested that hypothesis. The remedy is clear. Once you have a hypothesis, design a study to search specifically for the effect you now think is there. If the result of this test is statistically significant, you have real evidence at last.\\" =Data manipulation= Informally called \\"fudging the data,\\" this practice includes selective reporting (see also publication bias) and even simply making up false data. Examples of selective reporting abound. The easiest and most common examples involve choosing a group of results that follow a pattern consistent with the preferred hypothesis while ignoring other results or \\"data runs\\" that contradict the hypothesis. Psychic researchers have long disputed studies showing people with ESP ability. Critics accuse ESP proponents of only publishing experiments with positive results and shelving those that show negative results. A \\"positive result\\" is a test run (or data run) in which the subject guesses a hidden card, etc., at a much higher frequency than random chance. Scientists, in general, question the validity of study results that cannot be reproduced by other investigators. However, some scientists refuse to publish their data and methods. Data manipulation is a serious issue/consideration in the most honest of statistical analyses. Outliers, missing data and non-normality can all adversely affect the validity of statistical analysis. It is appropriate to study the data and repair real problems before analysis begins. \\"[I]n any scatter diagram there will be some points more or less detached from the main part of the cloud: these points should be rejected only for cause.\\" =Other fallacies= Pseudoreplication is a technical error associated with analysis of variance. Complexity hides the fact that statistical analysis is being attempted on a single sample (N=1). For this degenerate case the variance cannot be calculated (division by zero). An (N=1) will always give the researcher the highest statistical correlation between intent bias and actual findings. The gambler's fallacy assumes that an event for which a future likelihood can be measured had the same likelihood of happening once it has already occurred. Thus, if someone had already tossed 9 coins and each has come up heads, people tend to assume that the likelihood of a tenth toss also being heads is 1023 to 1 against (which it was before the first coin was tossed) when in fact the chance of the tenth head is 50% (assuming the coin is unbiased). The prosecutor's fallacy Discusses the notorious British case. has led, in the UK, to Sally Clark being wrongly convicted of killing her two sons. In court the low statistical likelihood (1 in 73 million) of a woman's two children dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome given by Professor Sir Roy Meadow were misinterpreted to suggested a low likelihood of her innocence. Even if the provided likelihood of double SIDS, which was later questioned by the Royal Statistical Society,Royal Statistical Society (23 October 2001). \\" \\" were correct one has to weight up all the possible explanations against each other to make a conclusion on which most likely caused the unexplained death of the two children. Available data suggest that the odds would be in favour of double SIDS compared to double homicide by a factor of nine \\". The conviction of Sally Clark was eventually overturned. The ludic fallacy. Probabilities are based on simple models that ignore real (if remote) possibilities. Poker players do not consider that an opponent may draw a gun rather than a card. The insured (and governments) assume that insurers will remain solvent, but see AIG and systemic risk. =Other types of misuse= Other misuses include comparing apples and oranges, using the wrong average, regression toward the mean, and the umbrella phrase garbage in, garbage out. Some statistics are simply irrelevant to an issue. Anscombe's quartet is a made-up dataset that exemplifies the shortcomings of simple descriptive statistics (and the value of data plotting before numerical analysis).

There are two ships in this class: MV Queen of Burnaby and . Both are propelled by controllable-pitch propellers. Both were built with two Mirrlees National KVSSM, V-16, 4 stroke-cycle, diesel engines, each producing at 320 revolutions per minute. History =Design= The two ships were originally part of a group of seven Victoria-class ships constructed between 1962 and 1965. These seven were soon modified to increase vehicle capacity. The first change was the installation of platform decks or ramps; the second modification saw the ships sliced in half vertically across the beam for the insertion of a midsection, which dramatically increased the car carrying capacity of the seven ships. Later, five of the seven ships (excluding Queen of Burnaby and Queen of Nanaimo) were cut horizontally from bow to stern and lifted to have a new vehicle deck inserted. As a result, Burnaby and Nanaimo, which had not had the midsection addition, were removed from the Victoria-class designation to become Burnaby-class vessels. =Service= In 1994, Queen of Burnaby was temporarily leased to another provincial crown corporation called Victoria Line. The vessel was renamed Royal Victorian, had a $4.7 million refit, and operated a once-daily summer service between Victoria and Seattle. After the demise of the Victoria Line, the vessel was purchased by Clipper Navigation, which operates the Victoria Clipper passenger-only service between Victoria and Seattle. The vessel was then renamed and repainted to become Princess Marguerite III, operating on the Victoria to Seattle route. In 2000, after Clipper Navigation also decided to end service on the route, the vessel was returned to the BC Ferries fleet under her original name, Queen of Burnaby.West Coast Ferries – Queen of Burnaby Retirement Queen of Burnaby was retired in May 2017, and the Queen of Nanaimo was retired in July 2017. They were replaced by three 145-car Salish-class ferries. The larger , which had a major refit of her passenger areas completed in 2009, is expected to see another ten to fifteen years of service and will be the sole survivor of the original seven ships.

On its western shore lies the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Duque de Caxias, and on its eastern shore the cities of Niterói and São Gonçalo. Four other municipalities surround the bay's shores. Guanabara Bay is the second largest bay in area in Brazil (after the All Saints' Bay), at , with a perimeter of . Guanabara Bay is long and wide at its maximum. Its wide mouth is flanked at the eastern tip by the Pico do Papagaio (Parrot's Peak) and the western tip by Pão de Açúcar (Sugar Loaf). The name Guanabara comes from the Tupi language, goanã-pará, from gwa \\"bay\\", plus nã \\"similar to\\" and ba'ra \\"sea\\". Traditionally, it is also translated as \\"the bosom of sea\\". History View of 203x203px Guanabara Bay was first encountered by Europeans on January 1, 1502, when one of the Portuguese explorers Gaspar de Lemos and Gonçalo Coelho Jorge Couto, 1995, A Construção do Brasil, Lisbon: Cosmos. arrived on its shores. According to some historians, Vasco Mariz, 2006, \\"Os Fundadores do Rio de Janeiro: Vespucci, Villegagnon ou Estácio de Sá?\\", in Brasil-França. Relações históricas no período colonial, Rio de Janeiro: Biblioteca do Exército, p. 80. the name given by the exploration team to the bay was originally Ria de Janeiro \\"January's Lagoon\\", then a confusion took place between the word ria \\"lagoon\\" and rio \\"river\\". As a result, the name of the bay was soon fixed as Rio de Janeiro. Later, the city was named after the bay. Natives of the Tamoio and Tupiniquim tribes inhabited the shores of the bay. After the initial arrival of the Portuguese, no significant European settlements were established until French colonists and soldiers, under the Huguenot Admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon invaded the region in 1555 to establish the France Antarctique. They stayed briefly on Lajes Island, then moved to Serigipe Island, near the shore, where they built Fort Coligny. After they were expelled by Portuguese military expeditions in 1563, the colonial government built fortifications in several points of Guanabara Bay, rendering it almost impregnable against a naval attack from the sea. They were the Santa Cruz, São João, Lajes and Villegaignon forts, forming a fearsome crossfire rectangle of big naval guns. Other islands were adapted by the Navy to host naval storehouses, hospitals, drydocks, oil reservoirs and the National Naval Academy. Underwater exploration in the bay was disallowed by the Brazilian government in 1985 amid a dispute with an American treasure hunter. Description Christ the Redeemer at the foreground There are more than 130 islands dotting the bay, including: * Lajes * Ilha do Governador – site of Rio de Janeiro's Galeão - Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport * Ilha de Paquetá * Ilha das Cobras * Flores * Ilha Fiscal * Ilha da Boa Viagem * Villegagnon * Fundão The bay is crossed by the Rio-Niterói Bridge ( long and with a central span high) and there is heavy boat and ship traffic, including regular ferryboat lines. The Port of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the city's two airports, Galeão - Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport (on Governador Island) and Santos Dumont Airport (on reclaimed land next to downtown Rio), are located on its shores. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro main campus is located on the artificial Fundão Island. A maze of smaller bridges interconnect the two largest islands, Fundão and Governador, to the mainland. There is an Environmental Protection Area (APA), which is located mostly in the municipality of Guapimirim and given the name of Guapimirim APA. Sunrise over Guanabara Bay from central 280x280px Environment Guanabara Bay's once rich and diversified ecosystem has suffered extensive damage in recent decades, particularly along its mangrove areas. The bay has been heavily impacted by urbanization, deforestation, and pollution of its waters with sewage, garbage, and oil spills. As of 2014, more than 70% of the sewage from 12 million inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro now flows into the bay untreated. There have been three major oil spills in Guanabara Bay. The most recent was in 2000 when a leaking Petrobras underwater pipeline released of oil into the bay, destroying large swaths of the mangrove ecosystem. Recovery measures are currently being attempted, but more than a decade after the incident, the mangrove areas have not returned to life. One of the world's largest landfills is located at Jardim Gramacho adjacent to Guanabara Bay. It was closed in 2012 after 34 years of operation. The landfill attracted attention from environmentalists and it supported 1700 people scavenging for recyclable materials. View of leftIn June 2014 Dutch windsurfer and former Olympic and world champion Dorian van Rijsselberghe made an urgent appeal to government and industry in the Netherlands to collaborate in cleaning up the bay, together with the Plastic Soup Foundation. The Dutch government picked up the message and formulated a Clean Urban Delta Initiative Rio de Janeiro together with a consortium of Dutch industry, knowledge institutes and NGOs which will be presented to the Brazilian authorities in the State of Rio de Janeiro. As part of the preparations for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the government was supposed to improve the conditions, but progress has been slow. There have been concerns that the efforts may only be short-term and abandoned following the Games, as there would be little political incentive to continue with them.

The Globe and Mail, December 8, 1999. Billed as a children's album, the album is a narrative detailing the adventures of Dot and Bug, two children from the land of Harmelodia who fall through a hole (as in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) into the land of Popopolis. In Harmelodia, the children attend weekly lessons where they learn highly regimented music, but in Popopolis, they learn to make music using their own creativity on fantastical instruments such as the \\"wingophone\\". The album is based on a story by Dave Bidini, and is packaged in a book containing Bidini's text with illustrations by Martin Tielli. Narration on the album is by Bidini's wife, Janet Morassutti. A different version of \\"Song of the Garden\\" was recorded for the band's 2001 album Night of the Shooting Stars. Guest musicians on the album include Sarah Harmer, Kurt Swinghammer, Mia Sheard and Kevin Hearn. It is also the only Rheostatics album which includes a songwriting credit for Don Kerr, the band's drummer from 1995 to 2001. Other notes In 2004, Centennial Secondary School in Belleville, Ontario created and performed a stage musical version of the album.

The disease is primarily caused by dermatophytes in the genera Trichophyton and Microsporum that invade the hair shaft. The clinical presentation is typically single or multiple patches of hair loss, sometimes with a 'black dot' pattern (often with broken-off hairs), that may be accompanied by inflammation, scaling, pustules, and itching. Uncommon in adults, tinea capitis is predominantly seen in pre-pubertal children, more often boys than girls. At least eight species of dermatophytes are associated with tinea capitis. Cases of Trichophyton infection predominate from Central America to the United States and in parts of Western Europe. Infections from Microsporum species are mainly in South America, Southern and Central Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by humans, animals, or objects that harbor the fungus. The fungus can also exist in a carrier state on the scalp, without clinical symptomatology. Treatment of tinea capitis requires an oral antifungal agent; griseofulvin is the most commonly used drug, but other newer antimycotic drugs, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have started to gain acceptance. Symptoms It may appear as thickened, scaly, and sometimes boggy swellings, or as expanding raised red rings (ringworm). Common symptoms are severe itching of the scalp, dandruff, and bald patches where the fungus has rooted itself in the skin. It often presents identically to dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis. The highest incidence in the United States of America is in American boys of school age. There are three type of tinea capitis, microsporosis, trichophytosis, and favus; these are based on the causative microorganism, and the nature of the symptoms. In microsporosis, the lesion is a small red papule around a hair shaft that later becomes scaly; eventually the hairs break off 1–3 mm above the scalp. This disease used to be caused primarily by Microsporum audouinii, but in Europe, M. canis is more frequently the causative fungus. The source of this fungus is typically sick cats and kittens; it may be spread through person to person contact, or by sharing contaminated brushes and combs. In the United States, Trichophytosis is usually caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, while T. violaceum is more common in Eastern Europe, Africa, and India. This fungus causes dry, non-inflammatory patches that tend to be angular in shape. When the hairs break off at the opening of the follicle, black dots remain. Favus is caused by T. schoenleinii, and is endemic in South Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by a number of yellowish, circular, cup-shaped crusts (scutula) grouped in patches like a piece of honeycomb, each about the size of a split pea, with a hair projecting in the center. These increase in size and become crusted over, so that the characteristic lesion can only be seen around the edge of the scab. Pathophysiology From the site of inoculation, the fungus grows down into the stratum corneum, where it invades keratin. Dermatophytes are unique in that they produce keratinase, which enables them to use keratin as a nutrient source.http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Mycoses/Cutaneous/Dermatophytosis/ Infected hairs become brittle, and after three weeks, the clinical presentation of broken hairs is evident. There are three types of infection: Ectothrix: Characterized by the growth of fungal spores (arthroconidia) on the exterior of the hair shaft. Infected hairs usually fluoresce greenish-yellow under a Wood lamp (blacklight). Associated with Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton equinum, and Trichophyton verrucosum. Endothrix: Similar to ectothrix, but characterized by arthroconidia restricted to the hair shaft, and restricted to anthropophilic bacteria. The cuticle of the hair remains intact and clinically this type does not have florescence. Associated with Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton violaceum, which are anthropophilic. Favus: Causes crusting on the surface of the skin, combined with hair loss. Associated with Trichophyton schoenleini. Diagnosis Tinea capitis may be difficult to distinguish from other skin diseases that cause scaling, such as psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis; the basis for the diagnosis is positive microscopic examination and microbial culture of epilated hairs. Wood's lamp examination will reveal bright green to yellow-green fluorescence of hairs infected by M. canis, M. audouinii, M. rivalieri, and M. ferrugineum and a dull green or blue-white color of hairs infected by T. schoenleinii. Individuals with M. canis infection trichoscopy will show characteristic small comma hairs. Histopathology of scalp biopsy shows fungi sparsely distributed in the stratum corneum and hyphae extending down the hair follicle, placed on the surface of the hair shaft. These findings are occasionally associated with inflammatory tissue reaction in the local tissue. Treatment The treatment of choice by dermatologists is a safe and inexpensive oral medication, griseofulvin, a secondary metabolite of the fungus Penicillium griseofulvin. This compound is fungistatic (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of fungi) and works by affecting the microtubular system of fungi, interfering with the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules. The recommended pediatric dosage is 10 mg/kg/day for 6–8 weeks, although this may be increased to 20 mg/kg/d for those infected by T. tonsurans, or those who fail to respond to the initial 6 weeks of treatment.Richardson, p. 88. Unlike other fungal skin infections that may be treated with topical therapies like creams applied directly to the afflicted area, griseofulvin must be taken orally to be effective; this allows the drug to penetrate the hair shaft where the fungus lives. The effective therapy rate of this treatment is generally high, in the range of 88–100%. Other oral antifungal treatments for tinea capitis also frequently reported in the literature include terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole; these drugs have the advantage of shorter treatment durations than griseofulvin. A 2016 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole were at least equally effective as griseofulvin for children infected with Trichophyton, and terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin for children with T. tonsurans infection. However, concerns have been raised about the possibility of rare side effects like liver toxicity or interactions with other drugs; furthermore, the newer drug treatments tend to be more expensive than griseofulvin. On September 28, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated that Lamisil (Terbinafine hydrochloride, by Novartis AG) is a new treatment approved for use by children aged 4 years and older. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat the infection. Lamisil carries hepatotoxic risk, and can cause a metallic taste in the mouth. Epidemiology Tinea capitis caused by species of Microsporum and Trichophyton is a contagious disease that is endemic in many countries. Affecting primarily pre-pubertal children between 6 and 10 years, it is more common in males than females; rarely does the disease persist past age sixteen.Richardson, p. 83. Because spread is thought to occur through direct contact with afflicted individuals, large outbreaks have been known to occur in schools and other places where children are in close quarters; however, indirect spread through contamination with infected objects (fomites) may also be a factor in the spread of infection. In the US, tinea capitis is thought to occur in 3-8% of the pediatric population; up to one- third of households with contact with an infected person may harbor the disease without showing any symptoms.Richardson, pp. 83–84. The fungal species responsible for causing tinea capitis vary according to the geographical region, and may also change over time. For example, Microsporum audouinii was the predominant etiological agent in North America and Europe until the 1950s, but now Trichophyton tonsurans is more common in the US, and becoming more common in Europe and the United Kingdom. This shift is thought to be due to the widespread use of griseofulvin, which is more effective against M. audounii than T. tonsurans; also, changes in immigration patterns and increases in international travel have likely spread T. tonsurans to new areas.Richardson, p. 84. Another fungal species that has increased in prevalence is Trichophyton violaceum, especially in urban populations of the United Kingdom and Europe.

All Saivite, Koumaram and other Hindu festivals are celebrated at the temples, especially Thai Poosam, Panguni Uthiram and Skanda Sashti. At Pachaimalai, there is a huge statue of Lord Senthilandavar, which can be seen miles away from the temple. Apart from his normal gold peacock mount, the temple also has a golden chariot. It is believed that sage Dhurvasa initially installed the deities at both Pachaimalai and Pavalamalai. Bannari Bannari Mariamman Temple is located at Bannari about 35 km northwest of Gobichettipalayam. The temple is dedicated to the Goddess Mariamman and attracts huge crowds round the year. The temple also has a marriage hall associated with it. Notable people * G. S. Lakshman Iyer, freedom fighter and philanthropist * K. S.

Tinea barbae is due to a dermatophytic infection around the bearded area of men. Generally, the infection occurs as a follicular inflammation, or as a cutaneous granulomatous lesion, i.e. a chronic inflammatory reaction. It is one of the causes of folliculitis. It is most common among agricultural workers, as the transmission is more common from animal-to-human than human-to-human. The most common causes are Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. verrucosum. Signs and symptoms Main symptoms that occur when affected with tinea barbae is pimple or blister amongst affected area, swelling and redness around infected area, red and lumpy skin on infected area. Crusting around hairs in infected area will occur, hairs on infected area will also be effortless to pull out. Tinea barbae can be itchy or painful to touch but these symptoms do not always occur.  Transmission  The transmission of tinea barbae to humans occurs through contact of an infected animal to the skin of a human. Infection can occasionally be transmitted through contact of infected animal hair on human skin. Tinea barbae is very rarely transmitted through human to human contact but is not completely impossible. Diagnosis  Diagnosis of tinea barbae will firstly include questions being asked from doctors about interactions with farm animals and lifestyle experiences. Doctor will then gain knowledge on possible disease by microscopy, this is viewing the skin under a microscope to get an enlarge view of infected area. Skin scraping and removal of hairs on infected area will occur for medical examination. To acquire causation of tinea barbae putting infected area under ultraviolet light can achieve this, as infection caused by animal and human contact will not show up as fluorescent under the ultraviolet light, compared to other causes of this disease. Treatment Treatment can vary with severity of the infection. Moderate cases of tinea barbae can be treated with topical antifungal medications. Topical antifungal medications will come in the form of cream, which can normally be obtained over the counter. More serious cases of tinea barbae warrant an oral antifungal medication.

Mughal-Era fireworks were used to brighten the night throughout the wedding ceremony. Walima ( '), or the marriage banquet, is the second of the two traditional parts of an Islamic wedding. The walima is performed after the nikah () or marriage ceremony. The word walima is derived from awlama, meaning to gather or assemble. It designates a feast in Arabic. Walima is used as a symbol to show domestic happiness in the household post-marriage.World faiths, Teach yourself - Islam. By Ruqaiyyah Maqsood. . Page 179/180. While walima is often used to describe a celebration of marriage, it is also held to celebrate the birth of a newborn and the purchase of a new home. As per shariat, Walima only takes place where the groom and bride resides. Debate: The Time of Walima Scholars have different views on what the correct time of walima is. The timing varies by culture and opinion; for example some believe it should take place: * at the time of the wedding contract (nikah) * after nikah and prior to consummation * at the time of the wedding procession (Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari, 9/287) * after consummation. Other uses of Walima Walima in literal translation means \\"to assemble\\" and is used to describe an assembly or party celebrating major life events. Walima is essentially interchangeable with American and English terms such as: wedding reception or celebration (when held to celebrate a marriage), birthday party (when held to celebrate the birth of a newborn), or housewarming party (when held to celebrate the purchase of a new home). Similarly, walima is generally interchangeable with other languages/cultures terms that essentially mean to assemble for the purposes of celebrating a marriage, newborn, or new home. While it is an Arabic term, it is not necessarily a term reserved for Muslims per se, as the word simply describes the event that is to be celebrated.

It was founded in 1810 with a decree by Napoleon as a branch of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, with the aim of training the teachers of the Empire to educate its citizens according to educational and methodological \\"norms\\". Eminent personalities from the world of science, literature and politics have studied at the Normale, among them Giosuè Carducci, Carlo Rubbia, Enrico Fermi and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Giovanni Gronchi, Giovanni Gentile, Massimo D'Alema as well as Alessio Figalli, in more recent times. In 2013 the Florentine site was added to the historical site in Pisa, following the inclusion of the Institute of Human Sciences in Florence (SUM). Since 2018 the Scuola Normale Superiore has been federated with the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa and with the Institute for Advanced Studies of Pavia, the only other two university institutions with special status that, in the Italian panorama, offer, in accordance with standards of excellence, both undergraduate and postgraduate educational activities. It ranks first in Italy in the Per Capita Performance parameter of the \\"Academic Ranking of World Universities\\" (ARWU 2018), second among Italian universities in the \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2019\\", and first in Italy in the Teaching parameter. History A detail of the main building, Palazzo della Carovana The Scuola Normale Superiore was founded in 1810 by Napoleonic decree, as twin institution of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, itself dating back to the French Revolution jurisdiction. The term ' (') was coined by Joseph Lakanal who, in submitting a report to the National Convention of 1794 on behalf of the Committee of Public Instruction, explained it as follows: \\" ', \\"Student Guidebook - Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa \\"This schools must indeed be the kind and rule of all others\\" = The Napoleonic period = The Napoleonic decree of 18 October 1810, concerning \\"public education establishments\\" in Tuscany – a province of the French empire from 1807 - established an \\"Academic student residence\\" in Pisa for university students. Twenty-five places were made available for students of the Faculties of Arts and Sciences, to create a branch of the Parisian École Normale Supérieure in countries where the use of the Italian language was authorized. The Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa was thus established at the behest of Napoleon. The term \\"Normale\\" refers to its primary teaching mission, that is to train high school teachers to educate citizens according to coherent teaching and methodological \\"norms\\". On 22 February 1811 the first call was issued, but the Pisa-based Normale began its activity only in 1813, when the first students of Arts and Sciences attended the Scuola. The first site of the Scuola was the convent of San Silvestro in Pisa: it was a student residence halfway between a military order and a convent, in which the life of the students was characterized by strict disciplinary regulations similar to those of the French Scuola of reference regarding admissions, occupations, punishments, rewards and even student clothing. Following the model of the École Normale Supérieure, the Scuola was entrusted to a \\"Director\\", assisted by the \\"Sub-director\\" and by the \\"Economo\\", in charge of administration, supervision of studies and the safeguarding of order. The Normale was reserved at that time to the best high school students, aged between 17 and 24, who during their two years of studies also obtained degrees at the faculties of Arts and Sciences of the Imperial University. The students had particular commitments and were obliged to take additional courses: they were supervised by four \\"ripetitori\\", chosen by the Director among the students of the Normale, who \\"repeated\\" the university lessons daily and coordinated the \\"conferences\\", which were a sort of seminar. With this qualifying training, after graduation the students committed themselves to teaching in secondary schools for at least ten years. The Napoleonic Scuola Normale had a short life: the only academic year was 1813/14, during which the physicist Ranieri Gerbi was Director. On 6 April 1814 Napoleon signed the act of abdication: the return of Grand Duke Ferdinand III to the throne of Tuscany coincided with the closure of the Scuola despite the various attempts to save it in the name of its function. = The grand-ducal period = The period of closure of the Scuola after the Napoleonic phase was actually quite short. The Grand Duke's decree of 22 December 1817 re-established the ancient Ordine dei Cavalieri di Santo Stefano (the Order of the Knights of St. Stephen) in Pisa: in 1843 the Council of the Order proposed to establish a \\"boarding school for young nobles\\" in the Palazzo della Carovana together with a Scuola Normale. It has to be said that even in the previous period novice Knights were often students of the University of Pisa and therefore the Palazzo was already, in effect, a \\"noble college\\". In order to study the feasibility of the new project, Grand Duke Leopold II of Lorraine nominated a commission, which re-established the original function of the Scuola Normale Superiore, that of preparing secondary school teachers. On 28 November 1846 a grand-ducal Motuproprio established the Scuola Normale Toscana, also called Imperial Regia Scuola Normale (because it was connected to the Austrian system). On 15 November 1847, the new headquarters in Palazzo della Carovana were inaugurated. The new Scuola was \\"theoretical and practical\\", intended to \\"train teachers of secondary schools\\"; it was a boarding school that offered ten free places (with advantages reserved for the Knights of the Order), which could be accessed by call at the age of eighteen, as well as other paid places. The boarding school was attended exclusively by students of Philosophy and Philology, while students of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the University were aggregated to the Scuola: the latter, however, were required to attend the pedagogy course and to practice teaching by doing teacher training in schools, in keeping with a strong professional connotation which was later to be abandoned. The course of studies lasted three years. In the grand-ducal period the Scuola was affected by the political climate: following the enthusiasm of the Risorgimento, the fear of subversive movements and tumults led to reactionary and confessional attitudes much lamented by the students themselves, including Giosuè Carducci, who was a student there between 1853 and 1856. = The post-unification period = With the new unified state, the legislative and administrative structure of the Savoy Kingdom was extended to the whole of Italy. The Italian school system was therefore regulated for over sixty years by the Casati law of 1859, originally issued for the Piedmontese and Lombard institutions: based on a centralized model, it gave private bodies the possibility to provide education, at the same time establishing the “diritto dello Stato all’insegnamento universitario”(the right of the State regarding university education) as well as the right to 'supervise' all the levels of the school system. In Tuscany the provisional government (1859–60) tried to protect the most illustrious local traditions, such as the Normale. After a long debate, in the Senate and in the press, on the opportuneness of maintaining this unique and anomalous institution, in 1862 it was officially named \\"Scuola Normale del Regno d'Italia\\". Various draft laws were submitted to the Camera to establish the Pisan modelOn the initiative, above all, of Francesco De Sanctis, then Minister of the Education (P. Carlucci, La Scuola Normale Superiore. Percorsi del merito 1810-2010, 31-32) by extending it to other universities or to reorganize and expand the Scuola Normale of Pisa. But the new unified State, engaged in financial measures and public works deemed to be more urgent, approved, with the decree of 17 August 1862, only some modifications to the Scuola's regulations, so that it could continue to function as a Scuola Normale italiana. The \\"new\\" Normale was introduced into the national legal system by the Matteucci Regulations of 1862, which eliminated any religious and confessional aspects, in line with the secular orientation of Italian politics. The years of study became four by ministerial decree in 1863, and a new organizational structure was established. At the educational level, the Board of Directors was divided into two \\"sections\\", Letters and Philosophy and Physics-Mathematics, formed by the relative teaching staff; the latter sections were the forerunners of the current Faculties, under the control of the \\"Director of Studies\\". The publishing activity of the Scuola began with the foundation of the two journals (Annali della classe di scienze in 1871 and Annali della classe di lettere e filosofia in 1873). With the development of the postgraduate course, the Scuola was increasingly taking on the function, as well as of a university college, of a higher institute of scientific education and research. At the political level the role of the \\"President\\" of the Board of Directors was defined as the authority responsible for the moral, educational and economic governance of the Scuola. Finally, at an organizational level, there was the increasingly important role of the Provveditore-Economo, who managed the services as well as the human and financial resources, and had disciplinary jurisdiction over the students. The Matteucci regulations followed those issued by Education Minister Coppino in 1877, establishing the opening of the boarding school also to the section of Sciences and simplifying the complex structure of the previous \\"Regulations of studies and examinations\\". = The Gentile Reform = In 1927, three years after the entry into force of the Gentile Reform, new regulations of the Scuola Normale were approved, which removed its qualification function while maintaining that of \\"preparing for teaching in secondary schools and for the examinations which award qualifications for such teaching\\" and of promoting postgraduate studies, accessible by all graduates at national level. Nationalist propaganda also took hold within the Normale and the control of the Regime became increasingly more invasive, up until the first serious episode of repression, with the arrest in 1928 of three normalisti for anti-Fascist activity. In order to deal with the disturbances caused by the political events and the decline of the Scuola, which had increasingly fewer students, the philosopher Giovanni Gentile, a normalista, as well as a prominent figure of Italian Fascism, ideologue of the Regime and minister of education, was nominated as commissioner; he later became Director of the Normale, in 1928. Gentile carried out a structural revision of the institution so that it would acquire national importance; to this end he oversaw the expansion of the headquarters and a considerable increase in the number of students and internal activities. His authority, together with the consensus of the Regime, allowed him to find means and collaboration for his project. Meanwhile, the relationship between the State and the Church inaugurated by the Lateran Treaty facilitated negotiations with the Archbishopric to obtain the availability of the Puteano College building which, together with that of the Timpano, would later be used to house the young normalisti while the expansion of the Palazzo della Carovana took place. The Normale Gentiliana, recognized by the Royal Decree of 28 July 1932, was inaugurated on 10 December. Equipped with a new Statute, the Scuola became an independent higher education institution, albeit still connected to the University of Pisa, and acquired legal status and administrative, educational and disciplinary autonomy. The Normale, affirming its uniqueness in the Italian school system, was expanded above all to educate an increasingly more selected cultural élite. In 1938 the Scuola Normale, like all the universities of the Italian Kingdom, endorsed the racial laws, which affected students and teaching staff. The Normale at that time still had many free-spirited souls in its midst: it was also the Scuola of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi – who, a few years from then, would join the Resistance - and formerly of Aldo Capitini, theorist of non-violence and firm opponent of the Fascist Regime. = The war and post- war period = The Scuola Normale continued its activity despite the Second World War, although with some regulatory limitations and many practical difficulties. In the meantime, also after the issuing of the racial laws, the dissent towards the Regime was becoming increasingly more evident among students and teaching staff. With the deposition of Mussolini by the Grand Council on 25 July 1943, the Normale remained under German domination, since geographically it belonged to the territory of the Republic of Salò. After the tragic air raid on Pisa on 31 August 1943, the new Director, Luigi Russo, threatened with arrest for political reasons, had to leave the city and was replaced by the mathematician Leonida Tonelli, who protected the library and the furnishings of the Palazzo della Carovana, transformed into German barracks, and transferred the most important collections to the nearby Certosa di Calci. On 2 September 1944 the city was liberated, but Palazzo della Carovana was requisitioned by the Anglo-American army: students and teaching staff were relegated to the Puteano College. Luigi Russo, reinstated as Director, continued the work of safeguarding the material of the Scuola and of its library, while the temporary site resumed its activities. On 25 September 1945, the Palazzo was liberated and, in addition to the restoration of the building, it was decided to issue a call for seventy places for veteran or partisan students. Luigi Russo and Leonida Tonelli initiated a long awareness campaign that allowed them to find financial resources, including contributions not coming from the state, and to create a heritage through donations and purchases, in accordance with a policy that would continue in the following years. The post-war Normale was also the era of women: seventy years from the admittance of the first woman to the Normale, in 1959 a \\"Female Section\\" was finally established, with headquarters in Palazzo del Timpano, to enable women to lead a collegial life within the Scuola. = From the post-war period to today = In the 1960s, the Scuola Normale faced the challenges of the \\"university for the masses\\". Between 1964 and 1977, under the firm management of Gilberto Bernardini, it affirmed its original vocation for the pure disciplines, renouncing the management of the medical and juridical Colleges (to which the Collegio Pacinotti for applied sciences had been added) : the process that would lead to the establishment of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies began from the latter Colleges. Between 1967 and 1968 students and teachers of the Normale took part in the protests that had started in Pisa and had spread throughout Italy; at the Normale not only was the entire university system challenged, but also the approach of the Scuola and its fundamental regulations. The difficult dialogue between the institution and its students gave rise to the 1969 Statute, from which the new educational framework of the Scuola and the profile of Institute of Scientific Higher Education emerged: in particular, a significant increase in the internal teaching staff, the foundation and the strengthening of research structures and a rise in the number of undergraduate and postgraduate students were achieved. Finally, the law of 18 June 1989 recognized the equivalence of the Scuola's post-graduate diploma to that of PhDs issued by Italian universities. In the academic year 2014/2015 the teaching curriculum for the postgraduate courses was expanded thanks to the merger with the Istituto di Scienze Umane di Firenze (SUM) (the Institute of Human Sciences of Florence, SUM), now named Department of Political and Social Sciences of the Normale. In 2018 the Normale was federated with the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa and with the University Institute of Advanced Studies in Pavia, to offer new educational opportunities that could integrate the skills of the three institutions in certain areas such as economic-political disciplines and the study of the physical-chemical dynamics that influence climate change and the repercussions in the agri-food sector. Following the merger between the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and the Istituto Italiano di Scienze Umane (the Italian Institute of Human Sciences), Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and the Residenza Aldo Capitini were added to the buildings dedicated to the activities of the Scuola; the latter building, following its renovation, was assigned to the students of the postgraduate courses of the Department. The Palazzone di Cortona (in the province of Arezzo) must also be added to this real estate; it is a branch of the Scuola used for conferences and summer schools organized also in collaboration with other authorities and academic and research institutions.  Academic structures  The first statute of the Scuola Normale Superiore The Faculty of Humanities is divided into subject areas, within which the individual courses are organized. The subject areas refer to: Literature, philology and linguistics; Philosophy; History and paleography; History of Art and Archaeology; Ancient history and classical philology. The Faculty of Sciences is divided into subject areas, within which the individual courses are organized. The subject areas are:Chemistry and geology; Physics; Mathematics and computer science; Biological sciences. The Department of Political and Social Sciences covers the subject areas of political and social sciences.  Teaching curriculum  The Scuola Normale Superiore offers both undergraduate education (which corresponds to the university curriculum of the bachelor's and master's degree) and postgraduate (PhD) education. = Undergraduate courses = The undergraduate courses of the SNS (Bachelor's and master's degrees) cover the teaching curriculum of three macro-disciplinary areas: Letters and Philosophy, Sciences and Political-Social Sciences (the latter only for master's degrees).The students selected through competition must follow both the courses taught at the Normale and the corresponding courses of study of the University, respecting rigorous study obligations. Studies are free of charge. = Postgraduate courses (PhD) = The Scuola Normale Superiore was the first Italian institution to create a PhD programme, in 1927. To date, the PhD courses of the Faculty of Humanities are: * Cultures and societies of contemporary Europe * Philosophy * Global History and Governance * Literature, art and history of medieval and modern Europe * Sciences of antiquity The PhD courses of the Faculty of Sciences are: * Astrochemistry * Data Science * Physics * Maths * Mathematics for finance * Methods and models for molecular sciences * Nanosciences * Neuroscience The PhD courses of the Department of Political and Social Sciences are: * Political science and sociology * Transnational Governance  Admission  Admission to the undergraduate courses and to the postgraduate courses (PhD) takes place by competition. You can access the Normale from the first year of university, or after obtaining a three-year degree. Finally, you can be admitted to the Scuola as a postgraduate student (PhD). For admission to the undergraduate courses, a commission formed by the research staff of the Scuola Normale and of other universities assesses candidates, attempting to identify talent for study and research. The tests, which usually take place in August and September, are written and oral, and concern the disciplinary fields chosen by candidates for their academic career. The exam topics are studied in such a way that admission to the Scuola is guaranteed not for notional and mnemonic skills but rather for originality and intuition. For access to the first year, A-level results and any other previous qualifications are not assessed during the exam. For access to the fourth year, results obtained for the bachelor's degree and any other previous qualifications are not assessed during the exam. The selection is rigorous: only about 5% of those who take part in the competition are usually admitted. Students of the Scuola Normale Superiore do not pay any fees for their studies: university fees are reimbursed and accommodation and board are free. For admission to the Postgraduate Course (PhD) the competition, open to graduates from all over the world, is based on qualifications and exams. Those selected receive a scholarship, as well as additional ad hoc grants for research activities in Italy and abroad.  Campus  Palazzo della Carovana, Scuola Normale's main buildingThe Scuola Normale is located in its original historical building, called Palazzo della Carovana, in Piazza dei Cavalieri, in the medieval centre of Pisa. = Library = The Library was established at the same time as the Scuola and is an essential tool for teaching and research. It currently occupies three locations overlooking Piazza dei Cavalieri - the Palazzo dell'Orologio, the Palazzo della Canonica and a part of the Palazzo della Carovana – and, a short distance away, the location of Palazzo del Capitano. The book collection, for the most part with open shelves, has now exceeded one million volumes in total. It focuses on the disciplines under study at the Normale, and also houses texts on information science, bibliography and librarianship. In addition to the regular acquisitions, it has also been enriched by donations by various scholars connected to the Scuola; among these we can mention Eugenio Garin, Michele Barbi, Francesco Flamini, Vittore Branca, Giorgio Pasquali, Arnaldo Momigliano, Paul Oskar Kristeller, Delio Cantimori, Sebastiano Timpanaro, Clifford Truesdell and Ettore Passerin d'Entrèves. A digital library is also being developed as part of the library service. = Archives = The Archival Centre of the Scuola Normale Superiore, established in October 2013, preserves, in addition to the rich documentary heritage of the Scuola, numerous archives of 19th and 20th century cultural figures acquired through testamentary legacies, gifts and deposits but also thanks to a targeted purchasing policy. Many collections come from former students and / or former lecturers of the Scuola Normale (collections from the directors Enrico Betti, Alessandro D'Ancona, Ulisse Dini, Luigi Bianchi and Gilberto Bernardini), but also from gifts or purchases: among these, mention must be made of the Salviati archive, which, among its important documents, also preserves an autograph manuscript by Machiavelli. = Research centres and laboratories = The research centres and the laboratories operating at the Normale are: * Bio@SNS - Laboratorio di Biologia(Biology Laboratory) * CRM - Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi (Ennio De Giorgi Mathematics Research Centre) * DocStAr - Documentazione Storico Artistica (Artistic Historical Documentation) * NEST - National Enterprise for nanoScience and nanoTechnology * SAET - Storia, Archeologia, Epigrafia, Tradizione dell'antico (History, Archaeology, Epigraphy, Tradition of the ancient) * SMART - Strategie Multidisciplinari Applicate alla Ricerca e alla Tecnologia (Multidisciplinary Strategies Applied to Research and Technology) * STAR - Systems and Theories for Astrochemical Research = Colleges and canteen = The students of the Scuola Normale, in Pisa, are currently housed in four colleges, located in the town: * The Carducci College is located in via Turati, not far from Pisa central station; it has been owned by the Scuola since 1994. Partially restored in 2002, it is also being renovated at the moment. This building was dedicated to the illustrious poet and scholar, Giosuè Carducci, who was an undergraduate student of the faculty of humanities from 1853 to 1856 and a Nobel Prize winner for literature in 1906. * The Fermi college, owned by the Scuola since 1993, is located a few steps away from the Palazzo della Carovana and has been used as accommodation for students since 1996. It is dedicated to the distinguished Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, a normalista as well as Nobel Prize winner for physics in 1938. * The Faedo College, which opened in 2006, is the last residential college acquired by the Scuola Normale and is shared with the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna. The building is located in Via del Giardino, near the Palazzo di Giustizia, and is dedicated to Alessandro Faedo, a normalista who subsequently became rector of the University of Pisa, president of the National Research Council and senator. * The Timpano College was the first real estate donation to the Scuola, in 1932: located on the Lungarno Pacinotti, it was donated to the Scuola by a singular character, the Calabrian Domenico Timpano, who had made a fortune selling, in the United States at the time of Prohibition, alcohol-based restorative products from his pharmaceutical industry. The building, damaged during the Second World War by the explosion of the nearby Ponte Solferino, was rebuilt in the 1950s, and was initially the female housing section for students of the Scuola Normale Superiore. Currently it is assigned to students and scholarship holders and is divided into three colleges: Timpano, Timpanino and Acconci (the latter acquired in 1967). Students of the postgraduate course do not usually stay in the colleges, but receive a monthly grant for accommodation; in Florence, however, the Residenza Capitini - a building owned by the City of Florence, recently renovated with funds made available by the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research - can accommodate students of the postgraduate courses of the Department of Political and Social Sciences . Those who have right of access to the canteen of the Scuola Normale, located on the lower floors of Palazzo D'Ancona (in the immediate vicinity of the Palazzo della Carovana, in Via Consoli del Mare 5) are: undergraduate students, Italian and international PhD students, research grant holders, scholarship holders, teaching and administrative staff, and guests of the Scuola.Piazza dei Cavalieri Church of the Knights of Order of Saint Stephen Rankings *The Academic Ranking of World Universities puts this system at the first place in Italy (National Rank # 1) and within the best 30 universities in Europe. *Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, together with Scuola Normale Superiore are named as leading institutions in Italy's six top higher education institutes by Times Higher Education World University Rankings, where for 2014-2015 was ranked at 63rd place in the world and 15th in Europe.

Facilities  The centre was designed for use as a short-term holding and remand centre for up to four days, and could originally hold up to ten juveniles of either sex; longer remand periods or sentences were moved to Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in Darwin. Expansion and re-configuration of the facility allowed for longer-term detention of up to 18 detainees: a maximum of 15 males in eight rooms, and up to three females in three rooms in a separate wing. However by 2018 there was overcrowding at the facility, with 24 youths held there. Improvements made after the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention had been made, including provision for school lessons; however in June 2019 it was found that the Centre was failing to provide nearly half of the classes. Four Corners program Graphic footage of repeated abuse of children at Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre and in Alice Springs was featured in ABC's Four Corners episode \\"Australia's Shame\\", which aired on 25 July 2016. The program also showed a 17-year-old boy shackled and hooded in a chair in Alice Springs (adult) correctional center. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was \\"shocked\\" at the \\"appalling treatment\\" of the detainees, which violates the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, to which Australia is party.

Political career A lawyer by profession, Cosgrove entered municipal politics and served as Mayor of the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario from 1973 until 1978. Cosgrove entered federal politics running as the Liberal Party candidate in York—Scarborough in a 1978 by-election for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. He was defeated in that run, as well as in the 1979 election. In the 1980 election, however, Cosgrove was elected, and was appointed Minister of Public Works, Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and Minister responsible for National Capital Commission in the Canadian Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He was reassigned in a 1982 cabinet shuffle to the position of Minister of State for Finance. He was dropped from the Cabinet in August 1983 but remained an MP until the dissolution of parliament the next year. Judicial career Cosgrove retired from the House of Commons to accept an appointment by John Turner to the bench of the Ontario Superior Court on July 9, 1984, shortly after Parliament was dissolved for the 1984 election. Cosgrove's judicial circuit was in eastern Ontario with his court based in Brockville, Ontario. In 1999, Judge Cosgrove stayed charges of murder against Julia Elliott after a 22-month trial. He ruled that the Crown attorney, police and a deputy attorney general had committed 150 constitutional violations, findings that were unanimously rejected by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the fall of 2003 with the Court ordering a new trial.

Cosgrove complained to the Canadian Judicial Council that the scheduled hearing was unconstitutional and damaging to judicial independence. His lawyer claimed that Bryant's action created a situation in which the Attorney-General could punish judges for making controversial decisions, since a complaint by an Attorney-General automatically would result in suspension pending a hearing. According to Cosgrove's lawyer: :It creates a 'chilling effect' that will undermine the ability of judges to adjudicate fearlessly cases, as justice requires. This chilling effect undermines and is wholly inconsistent with judicial independence. According to The Globe and Mail newspaper, Cosgrove's affidavit warned that judges might become afraid to criticize or rule against the Crown if they thought a vindictive attorney-general could, in effect, end their careers simply by lodging a complaint. The consequences of this were argued to be so negative that the process effectively permitted an attorney-general to become \\"the judge in his own cause\\". . Both the Canadian Superior Courts Judges Association and the Ontario Criminal Lawyers' Association supported Cosgrove's case. In October, 2005, the trial division of the Federal Court of Canada ruled in favor of Judge Cosgrove and stripped the Attorney-General of the power to force the Canadian Judicial Council to conduct hearings that could remove judges from the bench. The federal court ruling temporarily halted the proceedings against Judge Cosgrove who had been on a paid leave of absence since Bryant's April 2004 request for a disciplinary hearing. On March 12, 2007, however, the appellate division of the Federal Court of Canada reversed the trial division, and found against Justice Cosgrove. The Federal Court of Appeal set aside the decision of the Federal Court, dismissed the application for judicial review, and referred the matter back to the Inquiry Committee of the Canadian Judicial Council. On December 4, 2008, in a 4-1 decision, a committee of the Canadian Judicial Council found grounds for recommending to the federal justice minister that Cosgrove be removed from office. The full Canadian Judicial Council, made up of the 22 of Canada's chief justices and senior judges, met to consider the committee's recommendation and, on March 31, 2009 formally recommended to Parliament that Cosgrove be removed saying that \\"We find that Justice Cosgrove has failed in the execution of the duties of his judicial office and that public confidence in his ability to discharge those duties in the future has been irrevocably lost.\\" The decision also stated that \\"We find that there is no alternative measure to removal that would be sufficient to restore public confidence in the judge in this case.\\" This was the second time in the council's history that it has recommended the removal of a judge. The same recommendation was made in 1996 in regards to then Justice Jean Bienvenue who resigned rather than wait for Parliament to decide his fate. On April 2, 2009, Cosgrove resigned from the bench. If he had not done so, and had also not taken the option of making an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the finding, the House of Commons and Senate would have had to vote on whether to remove him from office, something which has never happened since Canadian confederation.

The centre opened in 1976 and closed in 2009. At times, it held a small number of illegal immigrants. When it was first established in 1976, the Belconnen Remand Centre was intended to hold around 16 people.

In December 1992, then ACT Attorney-General Terry Connolly flagged that the remand centre should be replaced, due to its outmoded architecture and the high operating costs identified at the time. The ACT Government made the decision to build a new prison, the Alexander Maconochie Centre, and to decommission the Belconnen Remand Centre, in 2003. A human rights audit of the operation of the Belconnen Remand Centre and other ACT correctional facilities was conducted in 2007, identifying issues to be avoided in the new Alexander Maconochie Centre, and matters to be improved in the meantime prior to the new prison's establishment.

Unico is a baby unicorn with white fur, a pink mane, and little cinnamon bun-shaped ears, who was born with the very special gift of making all living creatures lighthearted and happy. His friends in the various manga and anime incarnations of his story include Beezle, the young Devil of Solitude from Scottish Mythology (part of Celtic Mythology); Chao (or \\"Katy\\" in the English anime), a naive little kitty who longs to be a human girl, and to learn magic from a real witch; a spunky little Sphinx (in the second film), and a warm-hearted human girl named Cheri.  Summary  Originating from the Sanrio Lyrica magazine that ran from 1976-1979, the story is about an innocent young (boy) unicorn who possessed a special ability to bring happiness to anyone near him. This magical unicorn concept was naturally aimed at younger audiences, however it grew into larger popularity and is recognized today as a classic retro anime. The story began in ancient Greece with a young mortal girl named Psyche. She was the first friend to Unico, who was apparently so beautiful that the goddess Venus became jealous. The goddess attributes Psyche's beauty to her happiness and decides to remove the magical creature. A series of trickery takes place and leads to the kidnapping of poor Unico. Once the goddess Venus has Unico, she calls upon the second star, Zephyrus, later known as the \\"West Wind\\" in the film adaptation. The West Wind is commanded to take Unico through space and time, to the Hill of Oblivion with no memories of Psyche. In the 1981 film adaptation \\"The Fantastic Adventures of Unico\\" the gods believe that only they should have the ability to control others' emotions and decide that Unico must die. However, the gods feel that punishment may be to harsh and instead choose to send the West Wind to capture Unico and take him to the Hill of Oblivion. The West Wind takes pity on Unico and declines to follow the gods' commands. The gods are furious when they learn of the West Wind's defiance, and send the Night Wind to capture Unico. This is when the real adventures begin... To protect Unico from the gods, the West Wind must continually transport the little unicorn. Whenever Unico makes friends and brings happiness to others, the gods are alerted to Unico's whereabouts, so the West Wind appears to spirit him away, yet he is unable to say goodbye to his new friends. Once again his memory is taken and a new adventure begins again...https://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/12/16/forgotten-gems-in-animation- the-fantastic-adventures-of-unico/http://tezukainenglish.com/wp/?page_id=823  Media  = Manga = Unico appeared in several comic strips by Tezuka, with an ecological message. Tezuka's original manga was serialized in Sanrio's \\"Ririka\\" (Lyrica) magazine from 1976 to 1979, and was re-published by Shogakukan in 1984 in a learning magazine for children. = Anime =  Unico: Black Cloud, White Feather  In 1979, the same year the manga ended, Unico made his animated debut in Kuroi Kumo Shiroi Hane (Black Cloud, White Feather), an ecologically-themed pilot film (for a proposed anime television series) which was soon released directly to video. Unico meets a young girl named Chiko who is ill because of the pollution from a nearby factory, and becomes determined to save Chiko's life in order to cure her by destroying the factory. Unico was voiced in this film by Hiroya Oka and Rocío Banquells in the Spanish dub in 1980.  The Fantastic Adventures of Unico  Although the TV series was not picked up, Unico soon made it to the silver screen in two feature-length anime films produced by Sanrio and Tezuka Productions with animation by Madhouse Studios. Unico in the 1981 film Unico's first movie, titled The Fantastic Adventures of Unico in English and simply Unico in Japan, was released in Japan on March 14, 1981 and in Mexico on September 27, 1982 which Television premier on Canal de las Estrellas. This musical film, narrated by Iruka, directed by Toshio Hirata, written by Masaki Tsuji, and with animation by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, presents the back story of Unico's banishment by the gods and his subsequent travels, as well as his friendships with Beezle (to whom he grants his own horn) and Chao/Katy (to whom he grants the wish of becoming a human girl). Beezle the Scottish Devil (known as \\"Akuma-kun,\\" or \\"Little Devil,\\" in the original version) initially rejects Unico's overtures of friendship, but comes around when he realizes how lonely he really is. After Beezle saves Unico from drowning, the two begin their friendship in earnest, but then the West Wind comes to take Unico away so he will not be discovered. The next creature Unico encounters is Chao (Katy), a black-and-white cat who dreams of becoming a witch. Katy and Unico befriend a lonely old woman, whom Katy mistakenly believes is a witch and will teach her some magic as well as transform her into a human girl. When Unico changes Katy into a girl, Katy at first believes that the old woman did it, until Unico proves it was his doing by changing her back into a cat; but Unico, seeing how selfish Katy has become, refuses to change Katy back to a girl, until one day when Katy saves the old woman from drowning. Katy then becomes entranced by a man posing as a lord (Danshaku in Japanese, Baron de Ghost in English). He invites her to his castle, gets her drunk and attempts to seduce her. Unico follows, rescuing Katy (with help from Beezle) after transforming into a majestic white winged unicorn and destroying the demonic Cow Skeleton Monster that the \\"lord\\" had transformed into. Afterwards, the West Wind comes to take Unico away again, and Katy moves in with the old woman. This movie includes several songs, most of which were performed by the movie's narrators, singer/songwriter Iruka in the original version and Joan-Carol O'Connell in the English dub and Rocío Banquells in the Spanish dubbed; however, Chao/Katy's recurring theme song, Chao no Kuroneko no Uta (The Song of Black Cat Chao), was sung by Chao's voice actresses, Kazuko Sugiyama in the Japanese version and Robin Levenson in the English dub and Liliana Abud in the Spanish dub. The movie's other songs include Unico no Teemu (Unico's Theme), Hontou wa Subishikute/Lonelyhttp://www.animelyrics.com/anime/unico (Beezle/Akuma-kun's image song), and Majo Neko Chao (Witch Cat Chao)/Katy The Kitty Witch, all sung by Iruka or O'Connell. For the U.S. release, all of the songs were dubbed into English along with the spoken dialogue, except for the ending song over the closing credits, which is an instrumental in the English version. Unico was voiced by Katsue Miwa in the original version and Barbara Goodson in the English dub and Helena Rojo in the Spanish dub.  Unico in the Island of Magic  Moribi Murano (often miscredited as \\"Mami Sugino\\") directed the second movie, titled Maho no Shima e ユニコ 魔法の島へ (To the Magic Island) in Japanese and Unico in the Island of Magic in English, which was released on July 16, 1983, five days before the release of the first Barefoot Gen movie, which used many of the same production staff and in Mexico on January 30, 1988 which Television premier on Canal de las Estrellas. This film essentially picks up after The Fantastic Adventures of Unico with the West Wind dropping Unico off in a new location called Poland where the gods will be unable to locate him. The story begins with the West Wind erasing Unico's memory of the past events and he is left to once again fend for himself. Unico runs into a Heathcliff-like cat named Melvin Magnificat who is the apparent boss of the forest which Unico has stumbled upon. Later, Unico meets a kind-hearted young Polish girl named Cheri (also spelled \\"Cherry\\", voiced by Sumi Shimamoto). Cheri's older brother, Toby (in Japanese, \\"Torubi\\", voiced by Shuichi Ikeda), is working for the evil Lord Kuruku (in Japanese, \\"Kukuruku\\"), who plans to turn all living creatures, animals and people alike, into unusual zombie-like beings called \\"Living Puppets\\" to be his slaves. Toby's job is to change people into Living Puppets and then lure the Living Puppets to Kuruku's fortress on Nightmare Island in Baltic Sea off the Coast of Sweden in exchange for learning more of Kuruku's magic. His plan is to obey and serve until he learns enough to be the master, but fails to protect Cheri twice. Toby also takes on Melvin Magnificat (\\"Yamaneko\\" in Japanese) - who hates Unico because Unico \\"intruded\\" in \\"his\\" forest (the forest in which the West Wind left Unico) - as his assistant. After Cheri's parents and neighbors all get turned into Living Puppets, she and Unico team up to stop Kuruku. Seeking advice from the Trojan Horse, Unico and Cheri learn that Kuruku is a puppet who was mistreated by his owners and discarded. He washed up at the Ends of the Earth - where all unwanted \\"junk\\" ends up eventually - and was brought to life with the power of 200 years of sunlight exposure, determined to take revenge on the human race. With help from the Sphinx's daughter (voiced by Noriko Tsukase; named \\"Marusu\\" in Japanese but not given a proper name in the English version), Unico - who realizes that Kuruku is really just a lonely, friendless creature - is able to break Kuruku's spell, but since Kuruku's hatred was the only thing that kept him alive, Kuruku dies, reverts to puppet form, and Cheri keeps him as a toy. Soon afterward, the West Wind finds Unico and spirits him away once again to avoid detection by the gods who want him dead. As with the first movie, the second movie's ending song (Do-Re-Mi-Fa Lullaby performed by Emiko Shiratori) became an instrumental in the Spanish and English dub. Katsue Miwa in the original version and Barbara Goodson in the English dub reprised their roles as Unico in this film, while Verónica Castro took over their roles as Unico.  Saving Our Fragile Earth  Unico had one more anime appearance afterward, in a short film called Saving Our Fragile Earth made for showing at the Tezuka Osamu Animation Theatre at Tezuka Osamu World in Kyoto. This short, like the original pilot, had an ecological theme: Unico and Tsubasa, a talking tree boy, are distressed by the fact that the planet Earth has become polluted and drained of resources to the point of being uninhabitable. With help from the Sphinx and the \\"Time Fairy\\" (Astro Boy), the two travel back into the past to try to prevent humans from taking the wrong path and spare the Earth from ecological devastation. Famed voice actress Akiko Yajima provided the voice of Unico in this film and Aracely Arámbula in the Spanish dub.

However, the original VHS versions of the English releases of both movies are long out of print. The rights to all Unico manga and anime transferred from Sanrio to Tezuka Productions after Tezuka's death in 1989; unlike Sanrio, Tezuka Productions has no American distribution arm like Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki seems to hate Hollywood movies in the future, hence the reason why it took 25 years for the two movies to be licensed for an official North American DVD release. Discotek Media released both films on DVD, with both the English and Japanese audio tracks in April 2012. The 1979 Unico pilot film had never been released outside Japan at all until 2012, when it was featured as an extra on the \\"Unico in the Island of Magic\\" DVD release. It was later released on double feature DVD on April 29, 2014, alongside Amazing Nuts!, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, and Mazinger Z. These are also the first Sanrio films to be presented in Bilingual for the 1981 and 1983 theatrical features. Digital Manga Publishing successfully funded a Kickstarter to publish the manga in full color in English.  Other appearances  Unico makes some cameos in episodes of the Black Jack TV series adapted from the Black Jack manga. Unico also made an appearance in the Game Boy Advance game Astro Boy: Omega Factor, where he gives Astro Boy the ability to have a warm and tender talk with Dr. Tenma, his father. Unico also appears in the Astro Boy manga in a comic book. In the story, he was Dr. Foola's inspiration for a new robot: a mechanical unicorn. Unico can also be seen in a brief cameo in Columns GB: Osamu Tezuka Characters for the Game Boy Color. The Unico films (pilot, Fantastic Adventures, and Island of Magic) were produced by Sanrio, so some of Sanrio's characters such as Hello Kitty, Tuxedo Sam, and the Little Twin Stars make cameo appearances in the films.  Reception  On Anime News Network, Shaenon K. Garrity called it \\"a good-looking manga\\", saying the \\"artwork looks like a comic-book version of the prettiest Disney movie never made\\".

The prison houses sentenced male inmates with a medium or minimum security classification, along with a small number of male and female remand inmates in transit to other locations. The centre has a capacity of 790. The prison is made up of three sections: a medium-security facility for male inmates, a minimum-security facility for male inmates, and a new maximum-security facility for male inmates, due to open in 2020. Junee opened in 1993 as the first privately operated prison in NSW. History During 1989, representatives of the New South Wales Department of Corrections, including the Minister for Corrective Services, Michael Yabsley, visited the United States to learn first-hand about private corrections management. They toured US state and federal managed corrections facilities as well as privately managed correction facilities. Once satisfied that substantial benefits could be gained from private contract management, coalition support was gained and laws were amended. Instructions went out to government agencies to develop a competitive process to bring private corrections management to New South Wales. It was also decided that to allow for maximum efficiencies in management, the government would also call for tenders for private design and construction of a new prison. Following a call to local government authorities for an expression of interest in a privately managed correctional facility being located within local government boundaries, Junee town leaders and the elected representatives strongly supported the concept, and the town was selected as the site for a new correctional centre. The ensuing years saw extensive community consultation by both Corrective Services NSW and NSW Public Works as the government went about selecting an appropriate building contractor and final operator. By 1991, the NSW Government executed a contract with Australasian Correctional Services Pty Limited (ACS) for design and construction, and another contract with the same company for the management of the centre. ACS in turn executed two contracts, one with Thiess Contractors for the design and construction of the facility and one with Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd (ACM) for the management of the centre. The centre, completed in 1993 at a cost of A$53m, was expected upon opening to have a 30 per cent cost saving compared to traditional government prison operations. A special focus of this facility was the establishment of a private industry program to provide employment, valuable skills training and wages to inmates. Two other correctional centres built by the NSW Government at that time, but with each half capacity, were budgeted to cost A$57m each. New South Wales was the second state in Australia, after Queensland, to introduce private prisons. Junee was the first prison in Australia to be designed, constructed and managed by the private sector under a single contractual arrangement. The prison is managed by the GEO Group Australia, which was granted a new contract in 2001. Following the October 2009 privatisation of Parklea Correctional Centre, Junee is one of two privately operated correctional centres in New South Wales, both operated by GEO Group Australia.

This is a transfer locomotive. In the Whyte notation for classifying the wheel arrangement of steam locomotives, an 0-8-8-0 is a locomotive with two sets of eight driving wheels and neither leading wheels nor trailing wheels. Two sets of driving wheels would give far too long a wheelbase to be mounted in a fixed locomotive frame, so all 0-8-8-0s have been articulated locomotives of the Mallet type, whether simple or compound. In the UIC classification, this arrangement would be, refined to Mallet locomotives, (D)D. The type was sometimes called Angus in North America. Other equivalent classifications are: UIC classification: DD (also known as German classification and Italian classification) French classification: 040+040 Turkish classification: 44+44 Swiss classification: 4/4+4/4 The lack of leading and trailing wheels to assist the tracking and stability of the locomotive means that the 0-8-8-0 type is not suited to high speeds. The vast majority have seen use as very heavy switchers (generally for hump yard work), transfer locomotives for hauling cuts of cars between rail yards, or pushers for assistance on grades. Most locomotives of this arrangement were built and served in North America, but there were exceptions. The Bavarian State Railways (K.Bay.St.B) built some 0-8-8-0T tank locomotives of class Gt 2x4/4, classified after unification of Germany's railway systems as class BR96. These worked trains over heavily graded stretches of line, and were the largest locomotives in Europe when introduced. Failures In 1915, the New York Central purchased an 0-8-8-0 numbered 2000 but proved to be very unreliable and also very costly to maintain as the engine steamed poorly and jumped the rails often. The mallet was then only restricted to working in the yards in Albany, New York marshaling freight trains for the L1 and L2 class Mohawks. These mohawks would carry freight west towards Utica or south towards Poughkeepsie. Eventually in the 1930s, the engine was split into two locomotives. The result was a useful 2-8-0 freight engine and a barely functional 0-8-0T switcher engine. The switcher engine was later sold to the N&W; where they decided to convert their W2 2-8-0's to the newly designated W6 class 0-8-0t's based on the aftermath of the NYC 0-8-8-0 that earlier was cut into two engines because at the time they were looking for a yard goat engine that could work in the yards of Roanoke. This would keep the N&W; W6 class engines busy working near and around the area of Roanoke like bringing engines in for servicing, taking the engines to the coal elevators, water towers, the ready tracks and so on while the successful N&W; S1 and S1a's would handle the major switching tasks and servicing the local industries nearby. The original 0-8-0 was sold for scrap by 1950 while the W6 copies lasted until their retirement after 1958. The 2-8-0 freight engine maintained into service until NYC dieselization during the mid 1950s. The 2-8-0 and 0-8-0 locomotives that were from the 0-8-8-0 locomotive chassis do not exist anymore.

Although considerable parts of it are still in Romanesque architecture, it is widely consideredSusan Bernstein: Goethe's Architectonic Bildung and Buildings in Classical Weimar, The Johns Hopkins University Press\\"Strasbourg Cathedral Hangs On\\", The Christian Science Monitor, 13 October 1991\\"Art: France's 25\\", Time, 2 April 1945 to be among the finest examples of Rayonnant Gothic architecture. Erwin von Steinbach is credited for major contributions from 1277 to his death in 1318. At 142 metres (466 feet), it was the world's tallest building from 1647 to 1874 (227 years), when it was surpassed by St. Nikolai's Church, Hamburg. Today it is the sixth-tallest church in the world and the highest extant structure built entirely in the Middle Ages. Described by Victor Hugo as a \\"gigantic and delicate marvel\\", and by Goethe as a \\"sublimely towering, wide-spreading tree of God\\", the cathedral is visible far across the plains of Alsace and can be seen from as far off as the Vosges Mountains or the Black Forest on the other side of the Rhine. Sandstone from the Vosges Mountains used in construction gives the cathedral its characteristic pink hue. The construction, and later maintenance, of the cathedral is supervised by the \\"Foundation of Our Lady\\" (Fondation de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame) since 1224. History The genuinely Romanesque apse can only be seen from the courtyard of the adjacent complex of 18th-century buildings. Inside the cathedral, looking east André Friedrich: Monument to Johannes (Jean) Hültz, architect of the octagonal top, in Strasbourg. =Previous buildings on the site= Archaeological excavations below and around the cathedral have been conducted in 1896–1897, 1907, 1923–1924, 1947–1948, between 1966 and 1972, and finally between 2012 and 2014. The site of the current cathedral was used for several successive religious buildings, starting from the Argentoratum period, when a Roman sanctuary occupied the site up to the building that is there today. It is known that a cathedral was erected by the bishop Saint Arbogast of the Strasbourg diocese at the end of the seventh century, on the base of a temple dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but nothing remains of it today. Strasbourg's previous cathedral, of which remains dating back to the late 4th century or early 5th century were unearthed in 1948 and 1956, was situated at the site of the current Église Saint-Étienne. In the eighth century, the first cathedral was replaced by a more important building that would be completed under the reign of Charlemagne. Bishop Remigius von Straßburg (also known as Rémi) wished to be buried in the crypt, according to his will dated 778. It was certainly in this building that the Oaths of Strasbourg were pronounced in 842. Excavations revealed that this Carolingian cathedral had three naves and three apses. A poem described this cathedral as decorated with gold and precious stones by the bishop Ratho (also Ratald or Rathold). The basilica caught fire on multiple occasions, in 873, 1002, and 1007. In 1015, bishop Werner von Habsburg laid the first stone of a new cathedral on the ruins of the Carolingian basilica. He then constructed a cathedral in the Romanesque style of architecture. That cathedral burned to the ground in 1176 because at that time the naves were covered with a wooden framework. After that disaster, bishop Heinrich von Hasenburg decided to construct a new cathedral, to be more beautiful than that of Basel, which was just being finished. Construction of the new cathedral began on the foundations of the preceding structure, and did not end until centuries later. Werner's cathedral's crypt, which had not burned, was kept and expanded westwards. =Construction of the cathedral (1176-1439)= The cathedral's west façade Figures from the main portal of the west façade Lower part of the West façade, viewed from Place de la Cathédrale (Alsatian: Müensterplatz) The construction began with the choir and the north transept in a Romanesque style, reminiscent of and actually inspired by the Imperial Cathedrals in its monumentality and height. But in 1225, a team coming from Chartres revolutionized the construction by suggesting a Gothic architecture style. The parts of the nave that had already been begun in Romanesque style were torn down and in order to find money to finish the nave, the Chapter resorted to Indulgences in 1253. The money was kept by the Œuvre Notre-Dame, which also hired architects and stone workers. The influence of the Chartres masters was also felt in the sculptures and statues: the \\"Pillar of Angels\\" (Pilier des anges), a representation of the Last Judgment on a pillar in the southern transept, facing the Astronomical clock, owes to their expressive style. Rose window Like the city of Strasbourg, the cathedral connects German and French cultural influences, while the eastern structures, e.g. the choir and south portal, still have very Romanesque features, with more emphasis placed on walls than on windows. Above all, the famous west front, decorated with thousands of figures, is a masterpiece of the Gothic era. The tower is one of the first to rely substantially on craftsmanship, with the final appearance being one with a high degree of linearity captured in stone. While previous façades were certainly drawn prior to construction, Strasbourg has one of the earliest façades whose construction is inconceivable without prior drawing. Strasbourg and Cologne Cathedral together represent some of the earliest uses of architectural drawing. The work of Professor Robert O. Bork of the University of Iowa suggests that the design of the Strasbourg façade, while seeming almost random in its complexity, can be constructed using a series of rotated octagons. The west front of the cathedral was the work of chief architect (magister operis) Erwin von Steinbach. Erwin von Steinbach's son Johannes von Steinbach served as magister operis from (at least) 1332 until his death in 1341. From 1341 until 1372, the post of chief architect was held by a Master Gerlach about whom little is known (not to be confused with Erwin's other son, architect Gerlach von Steinbach), and in the years 1383–1387, a Michael von Freiburg (also known as Michael von Gmünd, or Michael Parler, from the Parler family) is recorded as magister operis; he was succeeded by Claus von Lohre (1388−1399). The octagonal north tower as it can be seen is the combined work of architects Ulrich Ensingen (shaft) and Johannes Hültz of Cologne (top). Ensingen worked on the cathedral from 1399 to 1419, taking over from Claus von Lohre, and Hültz from 1419 to 1439, completing the building at last.Les grandes dates de l’histoire de la Cathédrale de Strasbourg The north tower was the world's tallest building from 1647 (when the spire of St. Mary's church, Stralsund burnt down) until 1874 (when the tower of St. Nikolai's Church in Hamburg was completed). The planned south tower was never built and as a result, with its characteristic asymmetrical form, the cathedral is now the premier landmark of Alsace. One can see 30 kilometers from the observation level, which provides a view of the Rhine banks from the Vosges all the way to the Black Forest. In 1505, architect Jakob von Landshut and sculptor Hans von Aachen finished rebuilding the Saint-Lawrence portal (Portail Saint-Laurent) outside the northern transept in a markedly post-Gothic, early-Renaissance style. As with the other portals of the cathedral, most of the statues now to be seen in situ are copies, the originals having been moved to the Musée de l’Œuvre Notre- Dame. =Later history= Interior of the cathedral, 1617 Notre Dame of Strasbourg turned into a Temple of Reason during the French Revolution In the late Middle Ages, the city of Strasbourg had managed to liberate itself from the domination of the bishop and to rise to the status of Free Imperial City. The outgoing 15th century was marked by the sermons of Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg and by the emerging Protestant Reformation, represented in Strasbourg by figures such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer and Jacob Sturm von Sturmeck. In 1524, the city council assigned the cathedral to the Protestant faith, while the building suffered some damage from iconoclastic assaults. In 1539, the world's first documented Christmas tree was set up inside the Münster. After the annexation of the city by Louis XIV of France, on 30 September 1681, and a mass celebrated in the cathedral on 23 October 1681 in presence of the king and prince-bishop Franz Egon of Fürstenberg,La prise de Strasbourg : 1681 the cathedral was returned to the Catholics and its inside redesigned according to the Catholic liturgy of the Counter-Reformation. In 1682, the choir screen (built in 1252) was broken out to expand the choir towards the nave. Remains of the choir screen are displayed in the Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame and in The Cloisters.Strasbourg Virgin, on The Cloisters database The main or high altar, a major work of early Renaissance sculpture, was also demolished that year.Retable du maître-autel Fragments can be seen in the Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame. A round, Baroque sacristy of modest proportions was added north-east of the northern transept in 1744 by the city's chief architect Joseph Massol according to plans by Robert de Cotte and between 1772 and 1778 architect Jean-Laurent Goetz surrounded the cathedral by a gallery in early Gothic Revival style in order to reorganise the merchants shops that used to settle around the building (and would do so until 1843). In April 1794, the Enragés who ruled the city started planning to tear the spire down, on the grounds that it hurt the principle of equality. The tower was saved, however, when in May of the same year citizens of Strasbourg crowned it with a giant tin Phrygian cap of the kind the Enragés themselves wore. This artifact was later kept in the historical collections of the city until they were all destroyed during the Siege of Strasbourg in a massive fire in August 1870. During the same siege, the cathedral was hit by Prussian artillery and the metal cross on the spire was bent. The crossing dome's roof was pierced and it was subsequently reconstructed in a grander, Romanesque revival style by the Notre-Dame workshop's longtime chief architect, .Recht, Roland; Foessel, Georges; Klein, Jean-Pierre: Connaître Strasbourg, 1988, p. 48 During World War II, the cathedral was seen as a symbol for both warring parties. Adolf Hitler, who visited it on 28 June 1940, intended to transform the church into a \\"national sanctuary of the German people\\",\\"Nazideutschland im Elsass\\" or into a monument to the Unknown German Soldier. On 1 March 1941, General Leclerc made the \\"Oath of Kufra\\" (serment de Koufra), stating he would \\"rest the weapons only when our beautiful colours fly again on Strasbourg's cathedral\\".Le serment de Koufra During that same war, the stained glass was removed in 74 cases and stored in a salt mine near Heilbronn, Germany. After the war, it was returned to the cathedral by the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section of the United States military. The cathedral was hit by British and American bombs during air raids on Strasbourg's center on 11 August 1944, which also heavily damaged the Palais Rohan and the Sainte- Madeleine Church. In 1956, the Council of Europe donated the famous choir window by Max Ingrand, the \\"Strasbourg Madonna\\" (see also Flag of Europe Biblical interpretation). Repairs to war damage were completed only in the early 1990s. In October 1988, when the city celebrated its 2,000th anniversary (as the first official mention of Argentoratum dates from 12 BC), pope John Paul II visited and celebrated mass in the cathedral. The bishopric of Strasbourg had been elevated to the rank of archbishopric a few months before, in June 1988.

Its first forerunner was the so-called Dreikönigsuhr (\\"three-king clock\\") of 1352–1354, located at the opposite wall from where today's clock is. Then starting in 1547 a new clock was built by Christian Herlin, and others, but the construction was interrupted when the cathedral was handed over to the Roman Catholic Church. Construction was resumed in 1571 by Conrad Dasypodius and the Habrecht brothers, and this clock was astronomically much more involved. It also had paintings by the Swiss painter Tobias Stimmer. That clock functioned into the late 18th century and can be seen today in the Strasbourg Museum of Decorative Arts. The clock existing today originated in 1838–1843 (the clock has 1838–1842, but the celestial globe was only finished on June 24, 1843) and was built by Jean-Baptiste Schwilgué in Dasypodius' clock case, and with roughly the same functions, but equipped with completely new mechanics. Schwilgué made a number of preliminary studies years before, such as a design of the computus mechanism (Easter computation) in 1816, and built a prototype in 1821. This mechanism, whose whereabouts are now unknown, could compute Easter following the complex Gregorian rule. The astronomical part is unusually accurate; it indicates leap years, equinoxes, and more astronomical data. Thus it was already much more a complex calculating machine than a clock. Often the complicated functioning of the Strasbourg Clock made specialized mathematical knowledge necessary (not just technical knowledge). The clock was able to determine the computus (date of Easter in the Christian calendar) at a time when computers did not yet exist. Easter had been defined at the First Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 as \\"the Sunday that follows the fourteenth day of the moon that falls on March 21 or immediately after\\". (See also Easter controversy, Ecclesiastical new moon, and Paschal Full Moon.) Today tourists see only the sculpted figurines of this clock, but behind this ensemble there is a mechanism that engages and that represents one of the most beautiful curiosities of the cathedral. The animated characters launch into movement at different hours of the day. One angel sounds the bell while a second turns over an hourglass. Different characters, representing the ages of life (from a child to an old man) parade in front of Death. On the last level are the Apostles, passing in front of Christ. The clock shows much more than the official time; it also indicates solar time, the day of the week (each represented by a god of mythology), the month, the year, the sign of the zodiac, the phase of the moon and the position of several planets. All these automata are put into operation at 12:30 PM. According to legend, the creator of this clock had his eyes gouged out afterward, to prevent him from reproducing it. Similar legends are told for other clocks, such as the astronomical clock in Prague. In the same room, there is a statue of a man resting his elbows on a balustrade. According to legend this was a rival architect to the one who had built the pillar of angels, the architectural feat of the era, who contended that one single pillar could never support such a large vault, and he would wait to see the whole thing come crashing down.This section largely translated from L'horloge astronomique and Astronomische Uhr . A visitor's commentary of this clock was given after his visit in the summer of 1855 by Theodore Nielsen, a Danish kleinsmith journeyman in his memoirs.\\"With Staff in Hand\\" Memories of my wanderings in foreign lands. Aarhus Jutland Publishing 1903 As follows. \\"Everybody knows about the cathedral which is called Munsteren. There is a unique clock in the tower. Surely the only one in the entire world. It shows all time changes, Sun and moon eclipses besides the ordinary times of day. On top of the clock is a niche in which stands Death with a bell in one hand and a crossbone in the other. With this bone he hits the bell each hour to count the time. A Christ figure stands in yet another niche. On each side is a door, and when the clock strikes twelve the left hand door opens and the twelve apostles appear, one at a time. Each one bows deeply before Jesus who in turn lifts his right hand in benediction. Each one then disappears through the door to the right. When Judas appears Jesus hides his face in a fold of his cape. Besides all this there is an enormous rooster that crows and flaps his wings at the same time the Death figure hits the bell with the bone. Above and to the right is a life sized figure, a replica of the man who made the clock. He sits and looks down on his handiworks and you have to look twice to realize that it is not a living person sitting there. Parisians wanted a clock just like that for the Cathedral of Notre Dame. So the burghers of Strassburgh blinded the artist in order to make him unable to undertake the commission. He then asked to be taken up into the tower just once more and this was granted. While up there he put the mechanism out of commission, and the clock was stopped for many years. Several able watchmakers volunteered their entire time to try to get the clock to work again. Some of them became deranged of sheer frustration. But at last someone found the key and since then the clock performs perfectly once more.\\" There are several models of the Strasbourg clock, usually with simplified functions. One is in the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. From 1858 until 1989, the clock was maintained by the Ungerer company. This company was founded in 1858 by two brothers, Albert and Théodore Ungerer (Tomi Ungerer's great grandfather) who were Schwilgué's assistants and later in charge of the astronomical clock for three generations. Since 1989, the clock has been maintained by Alfred Faullimmel and his son Ludovic. Mr. Faullimmel had been employed by Ungerer between 1955 and 1989. Legends Münster One legend says that the building rests on immense piles of oak sinking into the waters of an underground lake. A boat would roam around the lake, without anyone inside, though the noise of the oars could be heard nevertheless. According to the legend, the entry to the underground lake could be found in the cellar of a house just opposite the cathedral. It would have been walled up a few centuries ago. The legend of the wind blowing around the cathedral is as follows: In olden days, the Devil flew over the ground, riding the wind. Thus he caught a glimpse of his portrait carved onto the cathedral: the Tempter, courting the foolish virgins (Matthew 25:1–13), in the guise of a seductive young man. It is true that his back opens up and toads and snakes come out of it, but none of the naïve girls notices that -- nor do many tourists for that matter. Very flattered and curious, the Devil had the idea to enter to see whether there were other sculptures representing him on the inside of the cathedral. Taken captive inside the holy place, he could not come back out. The wind always waits in the square and still howls today from impatience on the places outside the cathedral. The Devil, furious, makes air currents from the bottom of the church to the height of the pillar of angels.

The facility is operated by MTC Broadspectrum and has a current capacity for 823 inmates. The Centre accepts prisoners charged and convicted under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation and incorporates a minimum security work release centre for inmates nearing release with a capacity of 80. A Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional unit is incorporated within the centre. History Following a recommendation of the Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons (1976–1978), a prison was established at Parklea and initially designated as a maximum security prison. The prison was scheduled to open in October 1983, but following a scandal involving Rex Jackson, the opening did not take place until September 1985, although the first inmates were received in November 1983. The Centre opened with about 220 maximum security inmates with about the same number of prison officers. On 13 December 1987, prisoners began a disturbance that was attributed to the consumption of 'gaol brew' alcohol from fermenting fruit and sugar. During the riot, ten prison officers were injured, one officer was struck over the head with a typewriter, and several required transport to hospital. A subsequent review of procedures resulted in the withdrawal of oranges and sugar from all NSW correctional facilities. A second riot occurred on 23 September 1990, following the introduction of a restrictive policy for prisoners private property by Minister Yabsley. The incident caused massive damage to the gaol and a number of other prison institutions across the state who rioted in protest against the policy. Lockdowns in the prison system occurred across the state, which led to the Australian Human Rights Commission to describe the conditions in NSW as \\"a very serious violation of human rights\\". A large number of prisoners remained locked in their cells one month following the riots. After the riots, the prison was reclassified from maximum security to medium security, and in February 1992 was designated as a correctional prison for young offenders. In 2001 Parklea was reclassified to maximum security, and inmate numbers were expanded as an additional 92 cells were completed. The Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre (CDTCC) was set up at Parklea adjacent to the Parklea Correctional Centre in 2006. The CDTCC is a stand-alone prison with a stable sentenced inmate population, where patients with repeat drug-related charges participate in comprehensive drug treatment and rehabilitation. CDTCC can accommodate 70 inmates undergoing Stage 1 & 2 of the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program, with a further 30 inmates undertaking Stage 3 which comprises detention in the community. Entry to the program is by way of an order issued by the Drug Court. In the 2008 'mini-budget', the New South Wales Government announced its plans to privatise two prisons, Parklea and Cessnock Correctional Centre. Protesting against the privatisation plans, prison officers commenced industrial action during May 2009. While the privatisation of Cessnock was eventually ruled out, on 30 September 2009 it was announced that GEO Group Australia had been awarded the contract to manage Parklea Correctional Centre, commencing on 1 November 2009. Current operations GEO Group Australia assumed responsibility for operations at 06.00am on 31 October 2009, the handover representing the first time an operational publicly managed prison in Australia had been transferred to private management. In response to parliamentary questions in November 2009 the NSW Minister for Corrections, John Robertson, described the transition as 'hugely successful'. The transition involved GEO Group Australia seconding staff from its other prisons in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland. To ensure robust oversight of the transition process, and that GEO complied with its obligations Corrective Services NSW installed a team of senior staff on-site for the period of transition. The financial impact of the privatisation of Parklea Correctional Centre was immediate with media reporting on 9 November that the correctional staff overtime budget across the NSW publicly managed prisons had reduced by A$70,000 a day. In January 2011, Ron Woodham, the Commissioner for Corrective Services NSW, ordered that GEO Group Australia move all 73 inmates from the minimum security at Parklea Correctional Centre as part of a \\"major security upgrade\\" following the escape of three inmates from the minimum security facility. Following the installation of new perimeter fencing and a review of the classification of all minimum security inmates, the minimum security facility was reopened.

It was discovered on 2 March 1981, by American astronomer Schelte Bus at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The spheroidal S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 3.14 hours. It was named after British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. On the same night, Schelte Bus also discovered 5020 Asimov.  Orbit and classification  Clarke is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 2 months (1,147 days; semi-major axis of 2.14 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Crimea–Nauchnij in July 1972. The body's observation arc begins at the Siding Spring Observatory two weeks prior to its official discovery observation on 12 February 1981.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Clarke is a common, stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Three rotational lightcurves of Clarke have been obtained from photometric observations by the APT Observatory Group in Spain, by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California, and by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory (). Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve gave a rotation period of 3.143 hours with a consolidated brightness amplitude between 0.03 and 0.14 magnitude, which indicates that the body has a nearly spheroidal, non-elongated shape (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Clarke measures between 3.367 and 3.532 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.3259 and 0.366. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 4.10 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.3.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke (1917–2008), author of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The official naming citation was prepared with assistance from Richard Binzel and published by the Minor Planet Center on 3 May 1996 (). The asteroid's name independently suggested by Duncan Steel (). In the postscript to his novel 3001: The Final Odyssey, Clarke jokingly expresses disappointment that he did not receive asteroid 2001 as his namesake, instead it was named for Albert Einstein.

It is located south east of Melbourne via the South Gippsland Highway on the Bass Highway at the mouth of Anderson Inlet, in the Bass Coast Shire of Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. Known originally for the calm waters of Anderson Inlet, it is now also known for the discovery of Australia's first dinosaur bone. The town had a population of 5,437 as of the 2016 census. Inverloch is a popular tourist destination, particularly for swimming, kitesurfing and windsurfing at the calm waters of Anderson Inlet. Fishing and surfing are also popular. The town was first named Anderson Inlet after Samuel Anderson,after who the inlet was named following his discovery and report . It was later renamed Inverloch after Loch Inver (Lake Entrance) in Scotland. Western Beach (38), Anderson Inlet, Near Ozone Street History The Bunurong aboriginal people were custodians of this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to white settlement. The first European to settle in the Inverloch area was Samuel Anderson, who, together with his brothers and Robert Massie, ran cattle and grew wheat in the area. The Post Office opened on 1 September 1883 as Anderson's Inlet and was renamed Inverloch in 1889. The inlet on which the town is situated on is named Anderson Inlet after Samuel Anderson. As the area developed Inverloch became a port for the shipment of black coal from Wonthaggi to Melbourne. Australia’s first discovered dinosaur bone, the Cape Paterson Claw, was discovered here in 1903 by William Ferguson in Cape Paterson or what is now Eagles Nest in the Bunurong Marine National Park. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 5,437 people in Inverloch. 79.6% of people were born in Australia.

Bunurong Marine NATIONAL Park is an outstretching middle section of Bunurong Marine Park. The National Park part is about 21 km2 or about 5 km in length along the coast and stretching from 2.5 km east of Cape Paterson eastwards to a point 6 km south-west of Inverloch, extending seawards for 3 nm to the limit of Victorian waters. The restricted zone/state park (Bunurong Marine National Park inside Bunurong Marine Park), on foot begins after Undertow Bay heading towards Inverloch from Cape Paterson. It is an area past Safety Beach and rockpool and past Undertow Bay beach namely The Oaks, Twin Reefs, Shack Bay and Eagles Nest. It ends at Wreck Creek in Inverloch. It is prohibited to kill or take any matter (i.e., catch fish, collect seashells or kill or take any sea or land creature, living or dead) from the smaller of the two parks; Bunurong Marine National Park. Both parks are named after the Bunurong Aboriginal people. Bunurong Marine Park is considered special due to the unusual set of environmental conditions. It supports many marine animals including seastars, featherstars, crabs, snails, 87 species of fish, Whales and Seals. It has the highest recorded diversity of intertidal and subtidal invertebrates in eastern Victoria. The range of seaweed species is large. Flat Rocks is a beach which has large rockpools for rockpooling/rambling and direct access from Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. Bunurong Marine Park is seen and accessed at many different points along this coast, a popular one being near Cape Paterson caravan park on Surf Beach Road as it has a modified rockpool for swimming. The National Park is around to the left. Direct and more difficult access to the National Park is via car parks off Cape Paterson- Inverloch Road. Exploring, snorkelling and scuba diving are popular.

Several times attacked by enemy aircraft and dodging surface patrol craft, Piranha returned safely to Majuro. For the first part of her second patrol, Piranha joined 9 other submarines in offensive reconnaissance covering the Third Fleet during the assault on Peleliu, patrolling 30 August to 25 September. When Peleliu, deemed essential for the liberation of the Philippines, had been seized, Piranha’s group dissolved and she searched for targets westward along the 20th parallel, engaging an enemy patrol craft 9 October. She endured a heavy depth charge attack, but outsmarted the patrol vessel, returning to Pearl Harbor 23 October. During her third war patrol, again with an attack group, besides seeking worthwhile targets in the East China Sea 19 November to 13 January 1945, Piranha served as lifeguard during B-29 strikes on Kyūshū. She scored two hits on a merchantman 8 January {No.2 Shinto Maru}, only to be driven off by an escort without being able to regain attack position. Refitted at Guam, Piranha sailed 11 February for her fourth war patrol, a classic exhibition of submarine versatility. With her attack group she sought targets on the convoy lanes from Luzon to Formosa and Hong Kong. She spent 17 days on lifeguard during airstrikes on Formosa, on 27 February sinking a junk presumably serving as aircraft spotter. She was foiled by a large fleet of fishing junks from making a rapid approach on a convoy reported leaving Hong Kong 5 March. Daringly resorting to an ancient ruse of naval warfare, she improvised a Japanese naval ensign and ran it up. The deception was successful, and she threaded her way through the fishermen at flank speed, but was unable to locate the convoy. Piranha bombarded Pratas Island 26 March with 100 shells. Three times during this patrol, which concluded with 10 days off Wake Island, the submarine successfully maneuvered to avoid hits from attacking aircraft. She returned to Midway to refit 21 April – 17 May, then sailed for patrol, lifeguard, and bombardment at Marcus Island 22 May – 31 May. Here she was attacked several times by shore batteries. After refueling at Saipan, Piranha sailed to complete this patrol off Honshū. With the decimated Japanese merchant marine hugging its own coast, Piranha was frequently frustrated by shallow water and omnipresent escorts in her attacks. Hair-raising encounters with submarine chasers and aircraft were rendered infinitely more dangerous by being fought so close offshore, where she had little water depth for maneuver. Her persistence and courage paid off; she heavily damaged a freighter 14 June, sank a coastal tanker and destroyed a trawler laden with oil drums by gunfire 17 June. On 22 June 1945, she fired two torpedoes at the escort ship CD-196 at blowing off her rudder and killing two crewman. Two more trawlers fell to her gun 23 June. Though slightly damaged when their escort retaliated with depth charges, Piranha returned safely to Pearl Harbor 10 July. End of war and fate Her sixth and last war patrol lasted 14 hours; she had sailed from Pearl Harbor 14 August and was ordered back when hostilities ended the next day. Returning to San Francisco 11 September, Piranha decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 31 May 1946. There she lay in reserve, redesignated AGSS-389 on 6 November 1962, until stricken from the Naval Register 1 March 1967 and sold for scrap. Piranha received 5 battle stars for World War II service.

During their rule, the ferocious Pashtun tribes of Waziristan - part of the Karlanri Tribal Confederation - gave the British much headache. In fact, the British, known then as the 'foreigners' , had to deal with a full-fledged insurgency in Waziristan in the 1930s. At one point during the 1930s, the British had up to 18,000 troops in and around Waziristan, with Wanna being used as the forward headquarters and airbase.

It is located five kilometres to the west of the city centre on the southern shore of the Waitemata Harbour. The suburb stretches from the town centre / shopping area of the same name on its southern edge (Great North Road, and near the SH16 motorway) to the tip of the peninsula in the north. Its postcode is 1022. Geography Aerial view of Point Chevalier, looking north. Meola Reef visible top right, construction of Waterview Connection at bottom left The suburb is situated to the north of State Highway 16 and the campus of Unitec New Zealand and to the west of the suburb of Western Springs. It is largely sited on the triangular peninsula, which extends north into the harbour for 1800 metres. The soil is mostly clay without the overlay of volcanic material which covers much of the Auckland isthmus; this means the vegetation of the area is less lush than some of the other suburbs of Auckland. Visible from Coyle Park is Meola Reef, which is situated to the east of the Point Chevalier peninsula and bordering the suburb of Westmere. Meola Reef is an outcrop of black basalt rock which extends some distance north into the Waitemata Harbour. This is the end of the lava flow emanating from Te Tatua-a-Riukiuta, a volcano several miles south of this area. Formerly a landfill site, it has now been rehabilitated as a park and nature reserve. Other parks in the suburb include Walker Park, Eric Armshaw Reserve and Coyle Park. The latter is located at the northern tip of the peninsula. Demographics Point Chevalier, comprising the statistical areas of Point Chevalier West and Point Chevalier East, had a population of 8,460 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 291 people (3.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 828 people (10.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 3,033 households. There were 3,948 males and 4,509 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.88 males per female, with 1,734 people (20.5%) aged under 15 years, 1,389 (16.4%) aged 15 to 29, 4,014 (47.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,323 (15.6%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 82.0% European/Pākehā, 8.9% Māori, 8.5% Pacific peoples, 10.5% Asian, and 3.3% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 23.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 54.3% had no religion, 33.7% were Christian, and 6.6% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 2,643 (39.3%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 714 (10.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,462 (51.5%) people were employed full-time, 1,014 (15.1%) were part-time, and 189 (2.8%) were unemployed.  History  =Early history and European settlement= Before the European settlement of the Auckland isthmus in the 1840s, small Maori settlements existed in the area which later became Point Chevalier, including one at Meola Reef and a fishing settlement at Rangi-mata- rau (later Point Chevalier Beach). The latter was a staging point for shark fishing off Kauri Point on the inner Waitemata Harbour. As the city of Auckland grew, Point Chevalier gained strategic importance as it lay on what was then the main land route out of Auckland, the Great North Road. Because of this, a military encampment was located here during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. The name 'Point Chevalier' comes from Captain George Robert Chevalier (1825 - 1871), a musketry instructor serving in the 65th Regiment, stationed at this camp. The Point Chevalier area had a largely rural character up until the period between the two World Wars. =As summer destination= Coyle Park and Point Chevalier Beach were popular destinations for family outings during the interwar period, particularly in summer. Tramlines ran down Point Chevalier Road to Coyle Park, near the beach; during summer, special trams were laid on during summer to transport people from Grey Lynn, while buses brought others from Mount Albert and other suburbs in West Auckland. Following the Second World War, the combination of increased car ownership and the Auckland Harbour Bridge (1959) resulted in a complete reversal of this activity. The once crowded beach was deserted, and the various businesses that had prospered on the summer trade closed down or relocated. Whilst the tramlines were removed during the 1950s, the broadness of Point Chevalier Road - otherwise atypical for a fairly small suburb - and the paved-over roundabout terminus near Coyle Park both remain as evidence of their presence. Due to sand loss and degradation over the 20th century, Point Chevalier Beach was resanded in 2008 with 16,000 cubic metres of sand from Pakiri Beach pumped onto the foreshore, creating a more usable beach area. The resanding has attracted larger numbers of summer visitors in the years since, making the northern part of Point Chevalier busy (and sometimes congested with vehicles) on fine weekends and holidays and at festival times. =Demographic changes= Up until the 1980s Point Chevalier's population was largely blue-collar or elderly, the latter particularly due to the Selwyn Village retirement community (one of the largest in New Zealand). Over the 1980s and 1990s the suburb became home to increasing numbers of young families and middle-class professionals. However, 2013 census data suggested that Point Chevalier experienced a strong decrease in its young adult population (ages 20–34) after 2001; analysts have ascribed this to the increasing cost of housing in the central-western suburbs of Auckland. Architecture and landmarks Point Chevalier town centre, with the former 'Ambassador' cinema. The Liverpool Estate is a piece of land bordered at one end by Great North and Point Chevalier Roads. Besides housing, it now contains a supermarket, assorted shops and the Point Chevalier Community Library. The estate was created in 1913 by a group known as the Liverpool Estate Syndicate and was marketed as a \\"last opportunity\\" to acquire main road frontage close to the city. It was only a fifteen-minute walk to the Arch Hill terminus and a significant selling point was that a motorbus passed by. The Point Chevalier Motor Bus Company ran from 1915-1920 and was owned by prominent locals, including a member of the Dignan family. Following the First World War with the rising price of oil, it went into voluntary liquidation. Estate land was also connected to sewerage and drainage, gas and water were available on the boundary and a school was nearby. Another factor was that it was not far from the \\"beautiful Point Chevalier beach.\\"Heritage et AL: Point Chevalier's Liverpool Estate Several of the streets in the Liverpool Estate were named after New Zealand birds – Moa, Huia and Kiwi Roads and Tui Street - and according to the book Rangi-Mata-Rau: Pt Chevalier Centennial 1861-1961,Auckland Libraries: Rangi-mata-rau: the story of Pt Chevalier, 1861-1961 it was a bird-loving (although unnamed) member of the Dignan family who got the honour of naming them. The houses of the area are predominantly 1920s Californian bungalows and 1930s and 1940s Art Deco, which gives the suburb an interesting pre-war atmosphere. Rising real estate values have spurred gentrification and subdivision in recent years, particularly north of Meola Road and in locations near to the water. Towards the northern end of the peninsula there are many houses from the postwar period, and a number of larger architect-designed homes have recently appeared close to Point Chevalier Beach. There is a certain amount of light industry located in the area, especially close to Great North Road. Up until the mid-2000s car yards were a common land use along this road. There is a retirement community, Selwyn Village, on the western side, overlooking the Waitemata Harbour. This community is run by an Anglican church trust and includes self-contained houses and apartments, bed-sits, a hospital, and a chapel. The main shopping area at the intersection of Point Chevalier Road and Great North Road was developed during the interwar period; the most notable of the buildings here are: * The former cinema (1920s designed by Sinclair O'Connor)Ambassador Theatre, Auckland City Council web page later known as the 'Ambassador' theatre, and currently the Ambassador Bar. The bar is owned by sculptor Peter Roche, who works on his artworks in the building. *ASB Bank: Great North Road.

This 1920s classical style building is now occupied by a hostel. *The former Whau Lunatic Asylum. To the south of Great North Road, across State Highway 16, lies the former psychiatric hospital. This imposing brick Italianate/Romanesque structure was the largest building in the colony when it was built. Construction began in 1865, supervised by James Wrigley using plans from Great Britain. Dr Pollen's brickworks supplied the bricks. Following a fire in 1877, the reconstruction and extension of the hospital was supervised by Philip Herepath. Notorious as the \\"Oakley Mental Hospital\\" and \\"Carrington Hospital\\", it was decommissioned during the early 1990s. The buildings are now used as a school, part of the campus of Unitec New Zealand. *\\"The Old Homestead\\", a 19th-century wooden farmhouse, was located until 2013 at the corner of Alberta Street and Point Chevalier Road.

When first opened as Borallon Correctional Centre, it was the first private correctional facility operated in Australia. It had a capacity of 492 prisoners. The centre reopened as Borallon Training and Correctional Centre in 2016. History Whilst the prison buildings, equipment and land are owned by the Queensland Department of Corrective Services, Borallon Correctional Centre was originally operated by Corrections Company of Australia (which was in turned owned by Wormald International, Corrections Corporation of America and John Holland Group). It opened on 2 January 1990. In September 2007, Serco Australia won the bid to take over management at the prison. The facility cost $22 million to construct. The management company was responsible for the day- to-day running of the centre, financial management and the hiring of staff, within the bounds laid down by the Corrective Services Act 2000. Whilst they were not public servants, staff employed at Borallon Correctional Centre had the same powers and responsibilities as government prison counterparts with respect to the management of prisoners and are offered the same access to Departmental training as their government colleagues; the only exception was Custodial Officer training which was conducted in-house. Employees couldn't transfer to another prison nor receive public service benefits. Prisoners within Borallon Correctional Centre could work or take courses to correct their behavior. They could also complete schooling, TAFE and university studies. The contract to manage Borallon Correctional Centre was subject to tender between February and May 2007, with GEO, MTC, GSL and Serco selected as bidders. On 4 September 2007, Serco was selected as preferred bidder. Borallon Correctional Centre was decommissioned in early 2012, in conjunction with the opening of the new Southern Queensland Correctional Centre. The final date for visits to prisoners was on 22 January 2012. Borallon re-opened on 11 April 2016 as Borallon Training and Correctional Centre promoted as Queensland's first dedicated training prison, with a focus on education, training and employment outcomes. Borallon has different types of cells, including 95 'residential' cells and 153 'secure' cells. A further 244 cells require major changes to meet current standards due to recognized \\"hanging points\\".

The port village was built during the late 19th century by French chocolate maker Henri Menier. The village is the hub of Anticosti Island. Its population doubles in the summer with seasonal workers and tourists. The economic mainstays are outdoor tourism, especially deer hunting, and forestry/logging. Services available in Port-Menier are: general and grocery stores, gas station, banking (Caisse populaire Desjardins), car rental (Location Sauvageau), restaurant, and lodging. Port-Menier can be reached via a ferry that runs between Sept-Îles, Port-Menier and Havre-Saint-Pierre, as well as other destinations along the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River. This service is operated by Relais Nordik and runs from April through January.Relais Nordik Ferry Service The nearby Port-Menier Airport also provides transportation options for the town.  History  Port-Menier, Anticosti Island, in 1922 In 1680, Louis Jolliet became the first owner and Seigneurial Lord of the entire Anticosti Island. Together with him, the first few settlers arrived on the island. But no significant development took place until 1895 when Henri Menier bought the island and hoped to set up a seignory that could be self-supporting. He first established a settlement at Bay Sainte-Claire in 1895 but the bay proved too shallow for the large ships he would need. In 1900, he moved the settlement to Ellis Bay and established Port-Menier along the waterfront with a 1,000 meter wharf. He invested a substantial amount of money to construct a sawmill to service the logging operations that harvested softwood timber for building lumber and Wood pulp for the manufacture of paper products. The community was centered on a new cannery business designed to take advantage of the abundant supply of fish and lobsters. The town had its own hospital, school, Roman Catholic church, general store, bank, bakery, hotel, plus homes and rooming houses for the workers, and a 30-room Scandinavian-style mansion for himself. Once completed, the island was home to 800 permanent residents, most of whom were French Canadians. Residents and businesses obtained supplies from a sailing ship Menier operated between Quebec City and the Gaspé, and obtained coal from the mines at Sydney, Nova Scotia. After Henri Menier's death, the island and the village remained in his family until 1926 after which it became property of a succession of logging companies. The village was thereby not much more than a company town and saw little development. In 1974, the Quebec government bought the island and set up a working municipal council in 1984.

It is based on the concept of terroir and a form of geographic protectionism. History The origins of AOC date to the year 1411, when Roquefort was regulated by a parliamentary decree. The first French law on viticultural designations of origin dates to August 1, 1905,EC- ASEAN Intellectual Property Rights Co-operation Programme, Unit 4. Trademarks and Geographical Indications (by Professor Michael Blakeney, October 2007), p. 52 whereas the first modern law was set on May 6, 1919, when the Law for the Protection of the Place of Origin was passed, specifying the region and commune in which a given product must be manufactured, and has been revised on many occasions since then. On July 30, 1935, the Comité National des appellations d'origine (CNAO), with representatives of the government and the major winegrowers, was created to manage the administration of the process for wines at the initiative of deputy Joseph Capus. In the Rhône wine region Baron Pierre Le Roy Boiseaumarié, a trained lawyer and winegrower from Châteauneuf- du-Pape, successfully obtained legal recognition of the \\"Côtes du Rhône\\" appellation of origin in 1936. After World War II the committee became the public-private Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO). The AOC seal was created and mandated by French laws in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. On July 2, 1990, the scope of work of the INAO was extended beyond wines to cover other agricultural products . AOCs vary dramatically in size. Some cover vast expanses with a variety of climatic and soil characteristics, while others are small and highly uniform. For example, the Côtes du Rhône AOC \\"covers some , but within its area lies one of the smallest AOCs, Château-Grillet, which occupies less than of land.\\" Enforcement The INAO guarantees that all AOC products will hold to a rigorous set of clearly defined standards. The organization stresses that AOC products will be produced in a consistent and traditional manner with ingredients from specifically classified producers in designated geographical areas. The products must further be aged at least partially in the respective designated area. Under French law, it is illegal to manufacture and sell a product under one of the AOC-controlled geographical indications if it does not comply with the criteria of the AOC. AOC products can be identified by a seal, which is printed on the label in wines, and with cheeses, on the rind. To prevent any possible misrepresentation, no part of an AOC name may be used on a label of a product not qualifying for that AOC. This strict label policy can lead to confusion, especially in cases where towns share names with appellations. If the town of origin of a product contains a controlled appellation in its name, the producer (who is legally required to identify the place of origin on the product label but legally prohibited from using the full town's name unless the product is an approved AOC product) is enjoined from listing anything more than a cryptic postal code. For example, there are a dozen townships in l'Aude that have Cabardès in their names, several of which are not even within the geographical boundaries of the Cabardès AOC. Any vineyard that produces wine in one of those towns must not mention the name of the town of origin on the product labels.  Wine  There are currently over 300 French wines entitled to the designation AOC on their label. Legislation concerning the way vineyards are identified makes recognizing the various AOCs very challenging for wine drinkers not accustomed to the system. Often, distinguishing classifications requires knowledge of esoteric label laws such as \\"Unless the wine is from a Premier Cru vineyard, the vineyard name must be printed in characters no more than half the height of the ones used for the village name\\" On the other hand, while the process of label approval is enforced to the millimetre, the quality control for the wine in the bottle is much less strict. While a blind taster must approve the wine for it to receive AOC classification, this tasting often occurs before the product is even bottled, and by a local expert who may well have ties to the local vintners. Even if the taster is objective, the wine sample may not be representative of the actual product, and there is almost no way to verify that the finished bottled product is the same as the original AOC sample. Cheese In 1925, Roquefort became the first cheese to be awarded an AOC label, and since then over 40 cheeses have been assigned AOC status. Meat Poulet de Bresse On August 15, 1957, the National Assembly gave AOC status to the poultry of Bresse (Poulet de Bresse). In 2006, it awarded AOC status to salt marsh lamb raised in the Bay of the Somme. Lavender Lavandula angustifolia at the Abbaye de Sénanque in Gordes in the département of the Vaucluse In 1981, the AOC label was given to Haute-Provence Lavender Essential Oil. It refers to a very high-quality production and concerns only the essential oil of fine lavender - Lavandula angustifolia. The fields must be located within a specific territory at a minimum altitude of 800 meters. This geographic area covers 284 communities in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes- Alpes, Drôme and Vaucluse regions. Lentils Lentils from Le Puy-en-Velay have AOC status. (See: Le Puy Green lentil.) Honey Honey from the island of Corsica has been given AOC status. There are six certified varietals of Corsican honey: Printemps, Maquis de printemps, Miellats du maquis, Châtaigneraie, Maquis d'été, and Maquis d'automne. Butter France recognizes the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Vienne, Deux-Sèvres and Vendée AOC regions for butter. The Beurre Charentes-Poitou Beurre Charentes-Poitou has been assigned AOC status in 1979. Spirits Armagnac, Calvados, Cognac and Martinique Rhum Agricole all have AOC status. Other countries =Europe= Many other countries have based their controlled place name systems on the French AOC classification. Italy's Denominazione di Origine Controllata and Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita followed the model set by the French AOC, and the EU standard for Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWpsr) also corresponds closely. While Spain's denominación de origen is very similar, the classification of Rioja in 1925 and Sherry in 1933 preceded the French AOC system by a few years and show that Spain's DdO system developed parallel to France's AOC system to some extent. Similarly, Germany's Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete is a wine classification system based on geographic region, but it differs from the AOC in important ways. Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete wines are commonly seen as less prestigious than Qualitätswein mit Prädikat, making it more similar to the Vin de Pays or Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure systems. Portugal's Denominação de Origem Controlada, Austria's Districtus Austria Controllatus, South Africa's Wine of Origin, and Switzerland's AOC-IGP are all similar to the French AOC system as well. It appears also that AOC influenced the development of the European Union's protected designation of origin (PDO) system. = Switzerland = Switzerland has an appellation d'origine contrôlée certification for wines and an appellation d'origine protégée certification for other food products. Before 2013, the appellation d'origine contrôlée was used for all products. =United States= The United States' American Viticultural Areas also follows the model set by the French AOC. The United States Department of the Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau even uses the legal terminology \\"Appellation of Wine Origin\\" to describe a vintage wine's location of origin. The AVA indication on a label indicates that 85% of the grapes for wine are grown in the designated AVA. Overall, the appellation of a wine simply says where the grapes are from, although there are some particularities. If the appellation is a state, 100% of the grapes which go into the wine must come from the specific state. If a winery gets grapes from a neighboring state (for example, a California vintner getting Pinot noir from Oregon), it may label the wine \\"Oregon\\", but if the state is not a neighboring one (for example, a California vintner getting Cabernet from Washington state), the only permitted appellation is \\"American.\\" =Canada= In Canada, there is a government-sanctioned wine standard called Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA). It only applies to Canadian wines, and only the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia regulate it. =International trade issues= Outside their home country, protecting the AOC status of certain products can face challenges, notably from a legal perspective. Some countries do not uphold a geographical indication system for their own products and thus, products which are labelled AOC in France, for instance, can be confronted on the international stage with foreign products claiming a similar geographical origin, even though it has not been recognized as such by the AOC system. In such a case, France (or another country) may enter into bilateral agreements with other countries, whereupon the signatories accept to recognize a special status to a list of designated products, or it can also seek the development of rules or agreements at the World Trade Organization level. Since each country has its own legal and agricultural framework, the specifics of each trade relationship are likely to vary. Also, there are often conflicts between trademarks and geographical indications. For instance, in Canada, only Canadian wines can be VQA approved but other certification trademarks can be registered under the intellectual property legal regime. The owner of a certification trademark is then allowed to sell licences to be used for certain products meeting the owner's criteria. Thus in the case of wines, one AOC certification trademark is owned by the French Republic, while another is owned by Maison des Futailles, a wine producer, of which the publicly owned Société des alcools du Québec is a partner.

Fictional character biography The title character is Michael Tree, a female private detective who takes over her husband's investigation business when he is murdered. In her first case, she captures the murderer and discovers his link to the Muerta organized crime family. Ms. Tree's dead husband was named Michael Tree, the joke being that after the marriage they had the same name. (The female main character's real first name actually is Michael; when friends want to irritate her they deliberately mispronounce it as \\"Michelle.\\" Michael Tree hates being called Michelle.) Series creator/writer Max Allan Collins makes no secret of the fact that Ms. Tree was inspired by Velda, Mike Hammer's secretary, a stacked, gun carrying, six-foot tall brunette and Mike's lover, who was almost as tough as he was. The basic premise of Ms. Tree was, \\"What if Velda and Mike Hammer eventually got married, and on their honeymoon he was murdered?\\" Throughout the series, in addition to isolated cases that often touch on social issues of the day, Ms. Tree's vendetta against the Muerta family is a major plot thread. Her methods often include deadly violence, which she uses with little hesitation. In contrast to genre conventions, she faces serious consequences throughout the series for these violent actions including arrest, imprisonment, commitment to a mental hospital, and involuntary medication. In another genre divergence, the male Michael Tree's son, Mike Jr. (of course), inadvertently falls in love with the daughter of the Muerta matron. The female Michael disapproves of this arrangement, but respects her stepson's decision while observing with amusement the Muerta matron's futile attempts to discourage it. To Ms. Tree's shock, when the relationship grows enough to make marriage probable, the Muerta family decides Mike's stepmother is now family and initiates a reconciliation with her while going legit. In addition, Michael is impregnated by an old flame who is manipulating her to kill his wife. She decides to keep the baby, creating a unique series of adventures of this homicidal PI fighting off criminals even while dealing with a full term pregnancy, while the mob family she hates moves to protect her in their own way. Hard Case Crime In 2007, Hard Case Crime published Deadly Beloved, the first novel about Ms. Tree and the character's first appearance in 14 years. The book was written by Max Allan Collins, with a painted cover by Ms. Tree co-creator Terry Beatty. Hard Case Crime also published the complete Ms. Tree comic collection into graphic novel format for Titan Comics. Topicality Ms. Tree was extraordinary in that it frequently dealt with controversial political and sexual issues, yet never used that as a venue to push a particular biased opinion. As Kevin Burton Smith, editor of the Thrilling Detective Web Site put it, \\"How many other P.I.s have...dealt with the topics of homophobia, abortion [and bombing of abortion clinics], devil worship, child pornography, date rape and incest? And not just dealt with them, but asked some pretty damn hard questions that aren't easily answered by either end of the political spectrum. And all this in a comic book! It's a shame how many readers will never know of the existence of this series (due to the medium) because Ms. Tree is one of the most thought-provoking, and entertaining, private eyes around.\\" Parentage One of the series' conceits, often alluded to in the narrative but never acknowledged explicitly in the comic books, is that its title character is the daughter of Dragnet protagonist Joe Friday. Weaponry Throughout much of the series, Ms. Tree is armed with a Sterling .380 - a poor quality handgun. Eventually Collins reconsidered and had her carry a SIG P225 9mm, a far more serious choice. The character frequently uses her handbag as a weapon, bludgeon style swung on the end of its straps, which, weighted with her SIG, proves a 9mm can stop people in more ways than one. Production Ms. Tree's adventures were published by four different comic book companies including Eclipse Comics, Aardvark- Vanaheim, Renegade Press, and finally DC Comics. Her introduction and first storyline appeared in the first six issues of Eclipse Magazine, a newsstand- magazine-sized, black-and-white anthology title; shortly thereafter Eclipse began featuring the character in her own, regularly sized comic book. The first three issues of the Eclipse Comics series were titled Ms. Tree's Thrilling Detective Adventures. This was shortened to Ms. Tree with issue #4. Most storylines were multi-issue affairs. A notable exception was DC Comics' Ms. Tree Quarterly (renamed Ms. Tree Special for its last two issues) which was comic-sized but much thicker than a typical comic book, with a much higher page count, and presented a full-color, complete Ms. Tree story in every issue. In 2019, Titan Comics announced publication of a trade paperback collection of five Ms. Tree stories, which will also include the \\"rare Ms. Tree prose story\\" Inconvenience Store. The 264-page volume is slated for release on July 17, 2019.

Referred to as \\"a law unto himself\\", despite the fact that he never held public office and did not own the assets he controlled, he led a forest products company and owned newspapers. He worked for and with his brother-in-law Alfred I. du Pont for nine years before running the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust's businesses by himself for another 46 years. He founded and led the St. Joe Paper Company to become a major player in several industries in Florida. He was a leader of the pro-segregation, anti-homosexual, and anti-communist Pork Chop Gang, a group of Democratic Party legislators from North Florida. Early years Edward Ball was born at Ball's Neck near Kilmarnock in Northumberland County, VirginiaVirginia Tourism website: A Colonial Journey Through Virginia's Northern Neck and educated in the one-room Shiloh Schoolhouse. After completing primary school, he convinced his father to let him quit school and get a job. He had always been obsessed with making money; at one time, he prospected for gold in Alaska. However, when Ball's older sister, Jessie Ball became the third wife of Alfred I. du Pont in 1921, Edward was given the chance of a lifetime. He began working for his brother-in-law in 1923 at the lofty salary of $5,000 a year, and moved to Delaware where he was publicly named manager of the Clean Food Products Company. Privately, he was Mr. du Pont's confidential business partner and became a shrewd financier and caretaker of the du Pont de Nemours estate fortune.Florida State University: Coastal Laboratory Tidings-Spring, 2000 After Jessie & Alfred moved to Florida in 1926, Edward joined them. du Pont's death When Alfred died in 1935, his estate was valued at over $56 million, which, after estate taxes of $30 million, left $26 million. Alfred's will named Jessie as the principal trustee, but in reality, she deferred business decisions to her brother, Edward, who took control of the assets of the testamentary trusts, which included large Florida landholdings and industrial interests, including the Florida East Coast Railway.University of Florida Smathers Libraries: Special and Area Studies Collections-Edward Ball Papers Jessie preferred to handle the philanthropic activities of the trust while Edward concentrated on making money. Power Ball had no interest in running for office and little desire for material things; for most of his life, he didn't even own an automobile. Ball used various means to acquire enormous unofficial political power in Florida. He amassed a wide network of connections, and was the key figure in a group of 20 rural, conservative, north Florida politicians that controlled Florida from the 1930s to the 1960s called the Pork Chop Gang that spawned Florida's version of McCarthyism.Behind Closed Doors: The Dark Legacy of the Johns Committee-Pork Chop Gang by Allyson A.

The coalition supported racial segregation (which was practiced at the St. Joe Paper Mill) and was known for toasting \\"Confusion to the Enemy!\\" with Jack Daniel's whiskey. Ball rarely, if ever, took a public role in politics. With control over the vast du Pont business empire, he exerted political influence through his Florida banking empire, his ownership of numerous Florida newspapers, and by funneling unregulated and unreported cash to political operatives. Ball did not need to get his hands dirty or risk personal resources.Claude Pepper Foundation: Evaluation of Tracy Danese's Claude Pepper and Ed Ball: Politics, Purpose, and Power by Steve Hach Ball was a main (but not the only) financer of the defeat of Claude Pepper's effort to be reelected to the United States Senate in 1950. Pepper's liberalism and Ball's conservatism feuded through much of the 1940s and 1950s, prompting a book to be written in 2000: Claude Pepper and Ed Ball: Politics, Purpose, and Power. According to a 1979 article in the New York Times, Edward Ball at various times was called a Robber Baron and a political power broker; a clever man with a dollar and a dangerous man to cross; a courtly Virginian with the ladies and a ruthless foe. He is known for \\"orneriness\\" but insists his reputation is undeserved; he claims he was just a trusted functionary who did his best for the institution he served. Critics say he hijacked the trust as a tool of his personal power, treating the assets like a miser hoarding every coin. He had the reputation of a \\"tart- tongued, hard-nosed conservative financier\\". Personal life By all accounts, Edward Ball took little time for a personal life. Early on, he travelled constantly, scouting for possible acquisitions and checking up on existing assets. =Marriage= Ball married in 1933, but the union did not last. He approached marriage like a business deal and wanted everything in writing. The prenuptial agreement had 19 provisions which described the couple's wedded lifestyle and included a definition of \\"nagging\\". Ball wanted children, but his wife was unable to get pregnant due to reproductive problems several years before their wedding. Ruth Ball filed for divorce in 1943, but Edward Ball sought an annulment, unsuccessfully appealing it all the way to the Florida Supreme Court. He finally agreed to pay his ex-wife $250,000 alimony in 1949.New York Times: March 11, 1979-Ed Ball at 91: Embattled, Implacable; The Millionaire Du Pont Trustee Faces Law Suits by Jon Nordheimer Citation requires paid subscription =Thrifty= In an interview, Ball said, \\"I suppose some people might call me tight with a dollar.\\" The stories of Ball's frugal nature border on the legendary. Ed Ball owned a country estate called Southwood Farm outside of Tallahassee, but for years lived in a hotel room at the Robert Meyer Hotel across the street from his office in the Florida National Bank Building in Jacksonville. This was the site of a 5:30 weekday ritual for Mr. Ball, his business associates and buddies. Cocktails began when everyone was present, and lasted until the network news began at 6:00pm, at which time all conversation and movement ceased. Ed Ball took his news seriously. After the news concluded, the group moved to the River Club for dinner.Alfred du Pont, Ball's mentor Banking Alfred du Pont acquired a major interest in Florida National Bank (founded 1905) of Jacksonville shortly after arriving in Florida in the mid-1920s. Other banks were gradually added into what became the Florida National Group, which was one of the strongest banks in the state. In size, the branches eventually numbered 185, second only to Barnett Bank.New York Times: March 8, 1989-First Union to Acquire Florida National Bank by Michael Quint Ball built the Florida National Bank building at 214 North Hogan Street in Jacksonville in 1961. The structure was eleven stories tall and contained the corporate offices for the bank. Ed Ball also kept his principal office there for managing the du Pont Trust. After Ball's death, the structure was renamed the Ed Ball Building. On March 7, 1989, First Union Corporation, based in Charlotte, North Carolina announced that it would acquire Florida National Banks in a deal worth $849 million. The transaction occurred the following year. Paper Mill In anticipation of increased trade through the Panama Canal, the Apalachicola Northern Railroad was built from Chattahoochee to Port St. Joe in 1910 with plans to load large ships with goods to be taken through the canal, advertised as the “Panama Route”. When the depression hit, business dropped off and the railroad was in bad shape financially. Alfred I. DuPont purchased the struggling railroad in 1933 and created the St. Joe Paper Company. Dupont drew up elaborate plans for the development of his mill town as “The Model City of the South”, and then died. Ed Ball took control of the company in 1935 but never acted on the master city plan. Construction began in 1936 and from 1938 to 1996, the company operated a paper mill at Port St. Joe, Florida.Humanities & Social Sciences Online: Green Empire: The St. Joe Company and the Remaking of Florida's Panhandle by Kathryn Ziewitz and June Wiaz-2004 The company invigorated the local economy following the depression, employing thousands and paying good wages, but wreaked havoc on the environment. The mill released sulfurous exhaust and dioxin, a byproduct of the paper bleaching process that is a carcinogen. By the 1950s, the company was drawing of water a day from the Floridan aquifer, seriously depleting the water table. St. Joe Paper also clear-cut millions of acres of old growth forest, engaging in silviculture to replant the areas with slash pine. The practice decimated the native longleaf pine stands, reducing the species to \\"2 percent of its former range.\\" Because of this, the United States Department of the Interior designated parts of the region a Critically Endangered Ecosystem. Under Ball, the company also kept workers at the mill racially segregated. Ball continued the trust's aggressive land purchases throughout the 1940s and 1950s, sometimes for \\"mere dollars an acre\\" and landholdings reached . Most of the land was situated between Tallahassee and Pensacola, but there was substantial acreage in southern Georgia. The paper mill was most profitable in the 1960s, with products being directly marketed to company-owned box plants. Wakulla Springs Lodge Wakulla Springs is one of the deepest and largest freshwater springs in the world.Florida State Parks website: Ed Ball Wakulla Springs Ball purchased surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He imported marble and tile and hired craftsmen and artisans who built everything needed for the lodge on-site. Blacksmiths, millwrights, masons, stone cutters, painters, and artists created an elegant retreat using iron and stone; the high ceilings were painted with murals.Friends of Wakulla Springs State Park website: The Artistry of Historic Wakulla Springs Lodge There are 27 unique guestrooms, each with a voluminous marble bathroom, walk-in closet, and antique or period furniture. Ball dynamited parts of the Wakulla River to open the way for boats bringing his guests to the springs, then fenced off the water passage to keep out the \\"riff-raff\\". At the time the Lodge was built no telephone service was available in Wakulla County, so Ball ran a line through the forest from his base in distant (89 miles) Port St. Joe. In the mid-1960s, he donated land to Florida State University for a marine laboratory, which was completed in 1968 and named in his honor. Ball then sold the remaining land surrounding Wakulla Springs to the state of Florida, who created Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park. Railroads The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression were particularly hard on the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). The railroad declared bankruptcy and was in receivership by September 1931, just 18 years after Henry Morrison Flagler's death. Bus service began to be substituted for trains on the branches in 1932, and the Key West Extension was abandoned after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. However, streamliners terminating in Miami nevertheless plied the rails between 1939 and 1968, including such famous trains as The Champion and The Florida Special jointly operated with the Atlantic Coast Line. Adding to the woes was the Cuban embargo, thus reducing a significant portion of FEC's revenue. In 1961, Ball purchased a majority ownership of FEC for the DuPont Trusts, allowing the FEC to emerge from bankruptcy. That same year, a labor contract negotiation turned sour, leading to a prolonged work stoppage by non- operating unions beginning January 23, 1963, and whose picket lines were honored by the operating unions (the train crews). Arguably the most noteworthy chapter in Ball's business career was his battle against the railroad unions in the Florida East Coast Railway strike of 1963 to 1977. In order to try to save the railroad from its three decades-long state of bankruptcy, which if allowed to continue would have threatened the railroad with physical deterioration and even partial abandonment, Ball fought for the company's right to engage in its own contract negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industrywide settlement that Ball thought would include featherbedding and wasteful work rules. His use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, Federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad's right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the Florida East Coast took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, install various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs, all to an extent that most other railroads would not succeed in matching until years later. Ball therefore was a pioneer in the American railroad industry's struggle, beginning in the 1960s, to improve its economic efficiency. Ball's tenure saw the permanent end of FEC's passenger service. The FEC was forced to resume carrying passengers two years after the strike began, when the courts ruled the FEC corporate charter mandated that the railroad carry passengers as well as freight. In response, Ball instituted a bare-bones passenger service with only a box lunch for food and no baggage, which lasted until 1968. sister Jessie Ball du Pont Jessie's death After his sister died in 1970, Ball came under strong criticism for reinvesting the trust's income to build up their value instead of fully respecting the requirements of du Pont's will, which stipulated that after Jessie Ball du Pont's death, trust income was to be used to aid the Nemours Foundation in caring for crippled children and indigent elderly in Delaware. Ball ignored the criticism, but he couldn't ignore the wave of lawsuits that were brought by other trustees, the State of Delaware and others. Biographies In 1976, Raymond K. Mason collaborated with Virginia Harrison to author a book about the life of Edward Ball, Confusion to the enemy : a biography of Edward Ball. This book was the \\"authorized\\" biography, whereas the book, Ed Ball, confusion to the enemy by Leon Odell Griffith, published the previous year, was done by an outsider. Both were published prior to Ball's death. Across the Creek Ed Ball's favorite euphemism for death was \\"going across the creek\\", a reference he learned from Alfred du Pont. Three sides of the DuPont gunpowder mills were made of stone; the side closest to the creek with the water wheel was built of wood. If the powder accidentally exploded, the wooden wall acted as a safety valve so whole building would not collapse on the men inside. Unfortunately, if you were between the explosion and the wooden wall, you would be blown \\"across the creek\\" and probably die.Florida History: Alfred I. DuPont, Millionaire Philanthropist-copyright 2005 by John W. Cowart In a New York Times interview two years before his passing, he said that his life had been long and the critics be damned; he lived it the best way he could. \\"When I go across the creek, it will be because I can't help myself or can't work any longer.\\" Shortly before his death, he said, \\"I waited until I was too old to decide what to do with my own personal assets and have decided that I worked most of my business life managing the duPont estate.\\" Ball said he was very proud of what duPont had established in the Nemours Foundation, and upon his death, save a few minor bequests, he left his entire estate to the Foundation, with one stipulation - his bequest could be used in Florida only.\\" Ball died at the Ochsner Foundation Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana on June 24, 1981 from cardio-pulmonary disease and kidney failure; he had a history of heart problems and had suffered four previous heart attacks. When he died, the value of the du Pont trust had ballooned to $2 billion.New York Times: July 1, 1981-Edward Ball, Financier, Wills Estate to Crippled Children His late sister's foundation, the Jessie Ball duPont Fund, had assets of $75 million. Ball's own estate was estimated to be worth $75–200 million. Legacy * His name is prefixed to the Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park. * There is an Ed Ball Building in Jacksonville, Florida.

It is named after the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards and first described to science in 1896 The bird's length is Birdlife International and has red legs and facial skin. The male is mainly blue-black with a crest, and the female is a drab brown bird. The alarm call is a puk!-puk!-puk!. There are two varieties; the nominate form L. e. edwardsi has a white crest and upper tail, whereas the northern form, usually called Vietnamese pheasant, is found with a variable number of white rectrices. This difference in the two forms may be due to inbreeding of a restricted, fragmented population there, and has also been seen in captive, inbred L. edwardsi. In 2012 the nominate form of Edwards's pheasant have been uplisted to Critically Endangered by BirdLife International, having suffered from deforestation, hunting and the use of defoliants during the Vietnam War. The population is currently believed to number between 50 and 249 birds in the wild, mostly of the nominate form, but it is doing well in captivity, where it is the subject of ex-situ conservation. There have been no confirmed sightings since 2000 and in 2010 the World Pheasant Association (WPA) received funding from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund to survey forests in the central Vietnam provinces of Quảng Bình and Quảng Trị.

In the United Kingdom, this type is known as a Decapod', a name which is applied to types in the United States. Overview The lack of leading and trailing wheels makes this wheel arrangement unstable at speed, and it is a type usually confined to fairly low-speed work, such as switching (shunting), transfer runs, slow-speed drag freight, or running over mountainous terrain. The Russian E class was the most numerous single class of locomotive in the world, with around 11,000 manufactured. Usage =Austria= A Gölsdorf 0-10-0 at work in Slovenia, Bled Jezero station, 1971 In 1899, Karl Gölsdorf introduced his famous 180.00 class for the Austrian State Railway, an 0-10-0 for mountain regions which had a remarkably low axle load. It employed the Gölsdorf axle system and had the drive, unusually, on the fourth axle. The class existed both as simple expansion and as two-cylinder compound engines, and they later worked in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and France. =Canada= Three 0-10-0 locomotives were owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. =China= Sixteen narrow gauge 0-10-0 locomotives, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works from 1924 to 1929, remained operational on the Yunnan-Kopei Railway until 1990. =Finland= VR Class Vr3 no. 753, stored at Haapamäki in Finland The VR Class Vr3 0-10-0T was numbered in the range from 752 to 756 and nicknamed Rooster. The first locomotive was ordered in 1924 from Hanomag in Germany. No. 755 is stored at the Finnish Railway Museum. =Germany= The 0-10-0 type proved popular in Germany. Several types of freight tender locomotives of this arrangement were built between approximately 1905 and 1915, after which the wheel arrangement was abandoned in favor of the 2-10-0. Subsequent German locomotives of this type were tank locomotives, including classes BR82, BR87, BR940, BR941, BR942-4, BR945-17, BR9419-21 and BR975. =Indonesia= Decapod locomotive, numbered as E1060 by Japanese occupation. Currently operated by West Sumatra Division of Indonesian Railway Company in Sawahlunto, West Sumatra. The Staatspoorwegen ter Sumatara's Westkust (SSS) built a railway line on the west coast of Sumatra from 1887 until 1896. This railway used to haul products from Ombilin coal mines to the port of Teluk Bayur in Padang. Severe terrain with 8% grades required a locomotive with great power. The E10 was a rack tank steam locomotive employed in West Sumatra, of which 22 were built from 1921 to 1928 by Esslingen in Germany and SLM (Schweizerische Lokomotiv-und Maschinenfabrik) in Switzerland. The E10 has four cylinders, with two cylinders dedicated to drive the rack gears. The class E10 eventually consisted of 39 locomotives, of which the last seven engines were built in 1967 by Nippon Sharyo, the last steam locomotives to be built by that firm. The class was used in regular service until the mid-1980s.Kautzor, 2010 Continental Ry. Jrnl. #163 =Japan= Former JNR class 4110 0-10-0 preserved in Hokkaido, Japan, 2005 Four 4100 class 0-10-0T locomotives, numbered from 4100 to 4103 and built by Krauss-Maffei in Germany, were imported to Japan in 1912. Based on this design, a total of 39 4110 Class 0-10-0T locomotives, numbered from 4110 to 4148, were built in Japan in 1914 and 1917. The last members of the class were withdrawn from service on JNR in 1950, but some were sold to private freight railways and remained in service as late as 1971. Four of the locomotives were sent to the Korean Peninsula in 1938, but their subsequent fate is unknown. =Russia= Er 774 38 0-10-0 on a Steam Special in Moscow, 11 July 2010 The 0-10-0 type was the principal standard freight locomotive in Russia and was manufactured in very large numbers. The E class (Cyrillic Э, not to be confused with Е-class), freight locomotive was made up of several sub-classes, all developed from the same original basic machine. The sub-classes included E, Em, , Esh, Eu, and Er. Cutaway Russian locomotive class Er 791-81 at the Russian Railway Museum St.Petersburg A number of both the Em and class received condensing tenders for working in areas where water supplies were scarce. These were designated Emk and Egk class respectively. However, these locomotives were experimental and the condensing tender was mainly used on the 2-10-0 SO19-series locomotive. The E class was the most numerous single class of locomotive in the world, with around 11,000 manufactured in Russia and other countries such as Czechoslovakia, Germany, Sweden, Hungary and Poland. This class even far outnumbered the German DRB Class 52 2-10-0 Kriegslok. The class was eventually superseded by the SO class which can be considered a further development of the E class, the L class and the FD class . Despite being superseded, it was not replaced, and the class was widely used until the end of steam in Russia. =South West Africa= DSWA 0-10-0 no. 103, c. 1911 In 1911, the Lüderitzbucht Eisenbahn (Lüderitzbucht Railway) in Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika (German South West Africa) placed six Decapod locomotives in service, built in 1910 by Henschel & Son for a French Colony in Africa. The engines were rejected by French inspectors, however, and they were purchased by the German government for £2,000 each in 1911, on behalf of the Lüderitzbucht-Gesellschaft company who leased the Lüderitzbucht Eisenbahn and shared the profits with the government.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1948). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, January 1948. pp. 31–32.Henschel-Lieferliste (Henschel & Son works list), compiled by Dietmar Stresow. To protect the motion from wind-blown sand in the Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along the full length of the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion. The locomotives were placed in service on the Südbahn line from Lüderitzbucht via Seeheim to Kalkfontein, where they formed the mainstay of motive power. None of these engines survived the First World War. =Taiwan= A steam locomotive of this form served the sole purpose of pushing passengers up to the highest altitude station, 勝興, in Taiwan. =Thailand= Two Hanomag 0-10-0 steam Locomotives, numbers 401 and 402, were imported from Germany in 1913 for service in Siam and were used on standard gauge. In 1924 they were regauged to metre gauge. =United Kingdom= The Lickey Banker Only two 0-10-0 locomotives saw service on British railways. One was a suburban tank locomotive prototype, built by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway in 1902 and called the Decapod. The other was a tender locomotive, no. 2290, built by the Midland Railway in 1919, specifically for use as a banker for the Lickey Incline. =United States of America= 0-10-0 pusher locomotive of the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad, c. 1893 The 0-10-0 was not very popular in the United States and North America in general and probably fewer than seventy of this type were constructed. For switching work, large locomotives were preferred, and when more than four driven axles were required, the preference was for articulated locomotives such as 0-6-6-0 and 0-8-8-0 Mallet engines. On mainlines, a with the added stability of its leading truck, or a 2-10-2 or 2-10-4 with room for larger fireboxes, were preferred. The first 0-10-0 in the United States was built to provide service on Madison Hill which, at 5.89%, has the steepest standard gauge grade in the country. It was a tank locomotive, designed in 1868 by Reuben Wells for the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad and named for its designer. The Reuben Wells is on display at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It is long and weighs 55 tons. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway 0-10-0 of 1907 Later 0-10-0 versions were delivered in 1891 to the St. Clair Tunnel Company to haul trains between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan. The next were a series of 21 locomotives for New York Central Railroad and its subsidiaries for hump yard work. Others included seven owned by Illinois Central Railroad, fifteen by Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, two by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and four, the heaviest built, for Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway.

Players compete by spelling English words from cards in hands of increasing size, each card worth various points. The game combines aspects of Scrabble and gin rummy. The word \\"Quiddler\\" is a trademark. Play and scoring =Game play= Before play begins, all the cards are shuffled. A game of Quiddler consists of eight rounds; the first round has a three-card hand, the second round has a four-card hand, and so on until the game ends with a ten- card hand. While there is a single-player variation, the regular game requires at least two players. In the first round, the dealer deals out three cards to each player. The remaining cards form a draw pile. The top card is turned over to start a discard pile. The player to the dealer's left goes first. The player may choose the top card from either the draw pile (card is face down) or the discard pile (card is face up). The player adds this card to their hand. The player ends their turn by discarding one card from their hand so that the player ends up with the same number of cards as were dealt. A player may not use a dictionary during their turn, but the other players may. Turns are taken in the same manner in a clockwise rotation among the players. The round continues until one player can go out. A player can go out if he can use all the cards in his hand to spell one or more allowable words. After a player goes out, every other player then has one more turn. On the last turn, each remaining player uses as many cards as possible to spell one or more allowable words. After the round is finished, points on the cards used to spell words are counted toward the player's score. If the player had unused cards, the points on those remaining cards are subtracted. Ten-point bonuses are added to the score of the player with the longest word and to the player with the most words (if there are only two players, they should decide between them to limit the bonus to either the longest word or the most words). The subsequent rounds follow in the same manner, with the hands increasing in size by one card each round. Thus, in the second round each player is dealt four cards, the third round five cards, and so forth. Points are added at the end of each round. The game continues until the end of the eighth round (ten cards in the hand). Depending on the number of players, the discard pile may need to be shuffled to resupply the draw pile. The player with the most points at the end of the full eight rounds wins. =Allowable words= Players should decide on an English dictionary to be used during the game. An allowable word must appear as an entry in that dictionary or as one of the listed inflected forms of an entry word. Words must also use at least two cards. The makers of Quiddler have established several restrictions on the words used in a game. No proper nouns may be used. Capitalized adjectives, such as Iraqi and Scottish, may be used. Prefixes and suffixes by themselves are not allowable words. Words requiring a hyphen for proper spelling, such as ex-wife and twenty-two are also not allowed. The Quiddler rules disallow abbreviations, but do not differentiate between various forms. Players need to decide for themselves (or follow the example of the game dictionary) if they will allow acronym-derived words such as laser and NATO. The rules contain no restrictions on English words with accented letters, such as née, though the deck contains no such letters. Players must also decide for themselves if they will allow shortened word forms such as ad (for advertisement) and math. A player may challenge any other player if he feels that the latter has used a word that is not an allowable word. If the word is an allowable word, the challenging player must subtract from his score the number of points in the word. If it is not, the challenged player must subtract from his score the number of points in the word. The challenged player may not re-arrange his cards to form other words. Quiddler Deck Deck The card deck consists of 118 cards with individual letters from the English alphabet or common two-letter combinations. These include QU, IN, ER, TH, and CL. Each card has a point value reflecting its use in English words.

Aero is an aerated chocolate bar manufactured by Nestlé. Originally produced by Rowntree's, Aero bars were introduced in 1935 to the North of England as the \\"new chocolate\\". By the end of that year, it had proved sufficiently popular with consumers that sales were extended throughout the United Kingdom. By 1936, sales of the chocolate had reached New York City, and later spread to many other countries including Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Africa and Japan. Aero has been manufactured by Nestlé since 1988, after a takeover of Rowntree's. Known for its unique \\"bubbly\\" texture that collapses as the bar melts, it is available in many different flavours, and various forms including Aero Bubbles and Aero Biscuits.http://www.aerochocolate.co.uk/ History The process of manufacture was patented in 1935 by Rowntree's in York, England. The patent describes how the chocolate is heated and then aerated to create small bubbles. It is poured into moulds of the solid outer chocolate shell. As the chocolate cools, reduced air pressure allows the bubbles to expand inside the bar's filling. In 1935, Rowntree's launched Aero into the United Kingdom, followed by the Peppermint Aero in the 1960s. The wrapping was brown (green in the mint version) and displayed the \\"Rowntree's\\" script logo and the large word \\"AERO\\", along with the slogan \\"Hold on tight or I'll fly away!\\" below the \\"AERO\\" name. In 2014, the historical 1935 Aero packaging was placed online by historians at Rowntree's to help trigger nostalgic memories in people with dementia. The vintage packaging from the Nestlé UK & Ireland Archive was later released as a \\"reminiscence pack\\" on advice from the UK Alzheimer's Society. It included a 1950s Aero label to transform modern products. The 1953 Aero packaging commemorated the Queen's coronation. During July 1983, the heatwave in the United Kingdom caused the bubbles in Aero bars to collapse due to the chocolate melting. In August 1993, a factory worker at Nestlé UK's factory in York was injured by machinery that produced mint-flavoured Aero bars. He had leaned into the chocolate mixer to clean excess chocolate from the sides, and then fell, and became caught in the paddles, which started up automatically, causing severe injuries. Nestlé were later fined for failing to ensure worker safety by not isolating the power to the Aero mixer. In 1997, Unilever sued Nestlé, stating that Nestlé infringed Unilever's patent for aerated chocolate ice cream products. In 2004, three workers at the York factory were dismissed for intentionally misprinting rude messages on the packaging of 20 pallets of Aero bars. In 2008, the old Nestlé York factory on Haxby Road was closed, and a new £15 million Aero factory was opened next door, with the capacity to make 183 million chocolate bars per year. That same year, Aero's packaging was updated with metallised laminate film to improve freshness. In 2015, the factory was making more than one billion Kit Kats and 200 million Aero bars each year. Nestlé invested over £1 million in new factory equipment in 2015 to manufacture the new Aero Mousse bars. The texture of Aero bars have been cited as an example of a trigger for people with trypophobia, who have an aversion to holes. In February 2015, York's Chocolate Story museum celebrated the 80th anniversary of the launch of the Aero bar with demonstrations and activities. In September 2015, fashion designer Matthew Williamson collaborated with Nestlé to release a limited edition wrapper design for Aero Milk Chocolate and Aero Peppermint bars. The packaging was in soft pink and mint shades with metallic highlights and Williamson's butterfly motif. The Aero flavoured McFlurry frozen desserts were available up until 2015, and brought back in the UK in May 2019. The flavours include Aero Chocolate and Aero Mint Chocolate, with chocolate pieces and sauce.A Mint Aero bar An Aero Mint split =Distribution= As well as the United Kingdom, its place of creation, the bar is also sold as Aero in Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bulgaria (as LZ, through Aero is sold in some shops in Bulgaria), Canada, Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Hong Kong, Nicaragua, Ireland, Kuwait, Malta, Mauritius, Portugal, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. In Brazil, the bar is known as Suflair, but in 2014 Nestlé launched Aero in Brazilian market through subsidiary Garoto; in Hungary, Aero is known as Boci Aero and in the Netherlands as Bros (meaning \\"brittle\\"). Aero enjoys a large market following in South Africa with Aero, Aero Mint, and recently White Aero and Cappuccino Aero. The Aero bar was made available for a short time in the United States by Nestlé during the 1980s, though it seems not to have been a commercial success. However, they are still available at certain speciality vendors or supermarkets such as Big Y, Wegmans and Publix that import the bars. Previously, The Hershey Company sold Aero bars in the United States under licence from Rowntree Chocolate Company from 1937 until 1939. Hershey recently marketed a similar bar called Hershey's Air Delight but has since been discontinued. = Manufacturing = Aero bars were produced in Australia from the early 1970s until 1996. From 1996, the Aero bar was produced in Britain. In 2011, Nestlé recommenced manufacturing Aero bars in Australia at their Campbellfield factory in Victoria, with a capacity of up to 1000 tonnes per year. The bars had a different formula for Australian tastes with a smoother, creamier taste. The Aero bars sold in Britain would retain the older recipe. In April 2001, Nestlé Canada announced that Aero and other bars manufactured at their Toronto factory would now be made alongside bars containing nuts. Nestlé no longer guaranteed that the bars were free from nut- protein contamination. In May 2001, the decision was reversed due to consumer outcry, and the company retained their nut-free guarantee for Canadian bars. In 2004, Ukraine commenced producing Aero bars. In Germany, the brand Aero is owned by German chocolate brand Trumpf. Unlike the Nestlé Aero bars, the Trumpf Aero bars are solid white or milk chocolate, foamed up with carbon dioxide, and have no filling; the inside also has a different texture. = In other fields = In 1998, Space-Quest's Derek Willis was eating an Aero bar and was inspired by the bubbles to make the low-cost fuel, Aprop. In 2007, an observational study published in the British Medical Journal explored the use of the texture of Aero and Crunchie bars as a technique to explain bone structure to patients. They determined it was an overly simplistic method. In 2011, Ford engineer Carsten Stake was inspired by the texture of Aero bars in a bid to reduce the weight of plastic engine covers in their Focus vehicles. The MuCell plastic is injected with gas bubbles during moulding, making a microscopic honeycomb-like structure that is twenty per cent lighter and so lowers fuel consumption. Slogans and advertising = 1930s = The Aero bar was advertised in the late 1930s with the slogan, \\"You get a lift\\". Advertising about the imported bars in Melbourne, Australia in 1938 announced the Aero as the \\"...original English aerated milk chocolate... ...crisp, light and yet so sustaining.\\". = 1950s = Production ceased during wartime, and the bars were relaunched in the 1950s. The relaunch campaign had commissioned oil paintings of 40 \\"ordinary\\" women, to highlight that the chocolate bars were an accessible treat for all. The slogan used was 'Different... For her, Aero - the milk chocolate that's different!\\". After advertising Aero from 1951 to 1957, some of the portraits decorated the York factory for decades. In 2013, Nestlé attempted to identify the models, known as \\"Aero girls\\", to better track their company history. The portraits were exhibited as \\"Who Were the Aero Girls? Discovering Hidden Art in the Archives\\", at York's Mansion House, and the project website. Some of the models were later identified as Barbara Pitt, Janey Ironside, Rose Wylie, Myrtle Crawford (later, Lady Acland) and Pamela Synge. = 1970s = In the 1970s, Rowntree's aired an advertisement in which children flew an Aero bar as if it were a kite. = 1980s = In 1980, Nigel Havers featured in a train-themed Aero advertisement, which was included in the Animated Britain online project. In the late 1980s, the slogan \\"Each Aero Chocolate Bar Has The Nourishment Of Almost Three Ounces Of Milk\\" was created by Toronto advertiser John Straiton. In 1987, the advertisement won the Rotten Apple Award from the Quebec Corporation of Professional Dietitians, as the comparison between the nutritional benefit of confectionery and dairy was considered misleading. Rowntree had previously received the same Rotten Apple Award in 1984 for a similar comparison between the bar with milk in a previous advertisement. The slogan for Aero in Australia during the 1980s was \\"It's the bubbles of nothing that make it really something.\\" From the 1999 redesign and \\"singers\\" advertising campaign Aero's tagline was \\"Have you felt the bubbles melt?\\" This slogan was invented by Nick Welch, an advertiser and the father of Florence Welch of the indie band Florence and the Machine. In circa 1989-1993, a young couple playing chess advertisement was popular in Ireland on television. = 1990s = The Aero packaging in 1993 in America had the slogan, \\"Melt into the moment.\\", supported by television advertising showing a woman taking a bath in liquid chocolate. In 1996, Nestlé repackaged the Aero bar and relaunched it with television advertising that used voice-over by Dani Behr, and the phrase \\"Great chocolate taste.\\" They changed the structure of the blocks to make it easier to break into sections. The advertisement showed a woman's day dreams while floating away during eating an Aero. = 2000s = In 2000, Nestlé apologised and withdrew milk and white chocolate cranberry-flavoured Aero bars from the market. The accompanying slogan \\"Stuff Xmas! Treat yourself!\\", was considered potentially offensive by the Church of England and let to the suspension of distribution. In January 2001, the packaging was described as featuring a cartoon turkey with the words; \\"Delicious Aero chocolate with a touch of sauciness - What could be more uplifting than bubbles that melt into delicious Nestlé chocolate?\\". In 2001, The Aero White was relaunched as a permanent offering with a campaign theme, \\"Here to Stay\\". In May that year, Nestlé UK's \\"All Bubble. No Squeak.\\" campaign was previewed online prior to television, an unusual step at the time. It was previewed on the internet first, as the mouse character, Aeron, was computer-generated and this was considered a good strategy. The advertisement slogan, \\"All bubble. No squeak.\\", and the clip showed a man buying an Aero bar, which included a free hula-hooping mouse. He declined the mouse as the chocolate bar was considered good enough as to not require gimmickry. The animated mouse later won Best Animated Animal at the 2002 All Star Animal Awards. The promotional campaign included people in mouse costumes in Manchester providing passers-by with a hula-hoop challenge in exchange for a free Aero bar. In July 2001, presenter Davina McCall accidentally promoted Aero during a live eviction episode of Big Brother UK. She highlighted crowd banners that stated, \\"Hats Off To The Bubble,\\" mistakenly thinking that they were about evictee Paul \\"Bubble\\" Ferguson. It turned out that they were advertisements for the chocolate bar. In 2002, Nestlé Canada's research showed that consumers would often break the Aero bar into pieces and then let it melt in the mouth to prolong the experience. Their subsequent advertising showed two women, the first biting into the bar, the other responding, \\"What are you doing? That's not right.\\". In 2007, Aero Hot Chocolate was promoted as an ideal Winter drink, with an animated bubble \\"Lovely Bubbly\\" television campaign. In 2009, skateboarder Bob Burnquist featured in a UK ad called \\"feel the bubbles\\", filmed skating through chocolate coloured balloons, with the Jackson 5's song ABC playing in the background. = 2010s = The slogan in 2011 was \\"Irresistabubble\\"—a revival of a 1980s campaign that also featured the same word, and was created by Salman Rushdie, during his time as an advertising copywriter.Daily Express, P7, 8 April 1982. Rushdie has said that he invented a whole series of bubble words for the campaign, including Delectabubble. In 2012, agency Skive created the 'AeroMail' social media campaign in which consumers could \\"spread the bubbliness\\" of Aero with a digital balloon on Facebook. In 2018, The Interflex Group won the \\"Best use of process colours only\\" in the FlexoTech Awards for their work on the Nestlé Aero Chocolate Bubbles print design. The judging panel highlighted the use of CMYK with metallic effects by lamination, achieving a 'copper' look.

The mousse was produced by Nestlé's subsidiary Chambourcy yogurt brand. Nestlé Aero Mousse was introduced in Australia in 2001 in Chocolate and Chocolate Mint flavours. In 2008, the UK mousse range was expanded from Milk and White Chocolate flavours with Mint and Choc. They were also renamed to Aero Bubbly Dessert.

Musical style The Blood Brothers in Bloomington, Indiana in 2000 The Blood Brothers is commonly seen as a post-hardcore band and incorporate elements from a number of genres including experimental, screamo, noise, avant-garde, and dance. The band is particularly notable for having the unique dueling vocals of Johnny Whitney and Jordan Blilie. The style of guitar playing showcased by Votolato has greatly changed over time, most notably between the heavy, discordant sound of ...Burn, Piano Island, Burn and the minimalist lead lines of Crimes, where the energy of the drums and vocals tends to make up for the lack of thick distortion. Whitney's voice is generally accepted to have evolved from the slurred, venomous drawl on This Adultery Is Ripe to the high-pitched squeals (\\"like a child being tortured \\") heard on Crimes, while Blilie's voice has grown more distinctive while maintaining the same low, robust ferocity. The band has cited Drive Like Jehu, Gang of Four, Botch, and Antioch Arrow, among others, as influences.

Early years Birriel, (birth name: Felipe Birriel Fernandez ) was born in Carolina, Puerto Rico. He was the son of Pedro Birriel and Dionisia Fernández and was the oldest of six siblings. His highest level of education was up to the second grade in elementary school. As a child, Birriel was sent to the farm fields where he helped his parents plant vegetable seeds. He also worked in the fields picking fruits and coffee beans and as a waterboy, delivered water to the sugar cane workers.The Giant of Carolina In 1932, when Birriel was 16 years old, he started to grow at an alarming rate. One day, he went to visit a doctor because he felt sick with dizzy spells and because he was also feeling weak. The doctor informed Birriel that for some unknown reason, his pituitary gland had developed a tumor. Even though the condition did not have a known cure, it was still treatable. Condition treatment The treatment required a radio therapy machine which could only be found in the United States. The machine was sent in 1932, but it was not until 1941 -- nine years later -- that it finally arrived in Puerto Rico. Later years Birriel lived with his brother and sister-in-law in the town of Carolina and became something of a folk hero and known as \\"El Gigante de Carolina\\" (The Giant of Carolina). He appeared in the film Flight of the Lost Balloon filmed in Puerto Rico in 1961.Flight of the Lost Balloon In 1974, during the celebration of the FIBA World Basketball Championships celebrated in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Birriel was the guest of honor and was invited to the basketball court, in front of all the spectators he dunked the ball without jumping, a standing ovation followed. The Government of Puerto Rico and local businessmen helped him economically, since his daily personal needs could not be met with the money that he earned in personal appearances. The owners of local furniture stores also helped Birriel by making furniture especially for him. His health, however had worsened progressively and he died from a heart attack on March 15, 1994, at the age of 77, in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Birriel was unique in reaching a relatively old age while being as tall as he was; most extremely tall people tend to experience serious disabling medical conditions such as the ones that eventually crippled, and then killed, Robert Wadlow (the tallest human in the world during his lifetime) at an early age. Honors The town of Carolina is also known as the \\"Land of Giants\\" in honor of Birriel. Carolina also unveiled a mural which states the following: \\"Carolina, Tierra de Gigantes\\" (Carolina, Land of Giants). The BSN basketball team of Carolina is called \\"Los Gigantes de Carolina\\" (The Carolina Giants) and the town has dedicated a museum to the memory of Birriel and has also named a street \\"El Paseo Felipe Birriel\\".

In 1847 pioneer Jane Dillworth held the first classes in her tent for the children of the first Mormon families. By 1850 many schools had already sprung up around the valley, and there were plans for a school attached to every wardhouse. In 1851 the territorial legislature passed the first public school law creating the office of the superintendent of schools. Many large Mormon families, such as Brigham Young's, had their own schools, known as \\"family schools\\". In the last part of the 19th century, there was much controversy over how children in the area should be educated. Mormon influence in public schools created problems with non-Mormon parents, and raised issues about public school supervision. Mormons became upset about the number of private Protestant schools popping up. The schools would offer free tuition to Mormon students in order to convert them. Westminster College, although now a secular four-year college, is the last remaining example of these schools. LDS Church members also resented non-Mormon influences in the public schools and began to focus once again on efforts to develop church-run schools. Many Mormon youths in grades 9-12 attend some form of religious instruction, referred to as seminary. In years past students would attend during school hours and even receive credit for it. Although many still attend during school hours, they no longer receive any credit. Due to high birth rates and large classrooms Utah spends less per capita on students than any other state. Money is always a challenge and many businesses donate to support schools. Several districts have set up foundations to raise money.

Philosophy His work in philosophy of science included criticisms of David Hume's Inductive scepticism. He offered a positive response to the problem of induction in his 1986 work, The Rationality of Induction. In Popper and After: Four Modern Irrationalists, Stove attacks Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend. In 1985 Stove held a competition to find the \\"Worst Argument in the World\\", and awarded the prize to himself for the argument concluding \\"we cannot know things as they are in themselves\\". He called this argument \\"The Gem\\" and argued that it appeared widely in various forms.https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/worst.html His book The Plato Cult and Other Philosophical Follies contains the influential essay \\"What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts?\\" Stove was also a critic of sociobiology, describing it as a new religion in which genes play the role of gods.Stove, David (1992).

Play =Basics= Shanghai rummy is played with multiple decks of 54 standard playing cards, including the Jokers. Two decks are required for a game of up to four players. Five or six players require three decks. Aces are high (above a King) or low, (below 2). ch game has ten hands, and the rules for each hand are unique. One person begins as dealer for the first hand, and then the person to the dealer's left becomes dealer for the next hand, and so on. Each player is dealt eleven cards for each of the ten rounds. The rest of the deck is then placed face down in the middle of the players; this is referred to as the deck. One card is taken from the top of the deck and placed face up next to it. This card is called the upcard and becomes the beginning of the discard pile. Each player has a choice at the beginning of their turn. They may either pick up one new card from the top of the deck or take the upcard. (Also, the other players in the game have the ability to get the upcard.) After the player draws his card, either from the deck or the upcard, he must then choose any card in his hand to discard, and he then places this card face up on the discard pile. That card then becomes the new upcard, which the next player in turn can take or other players can buy. To get a card that isn't yours a player must say, “BUY\\", before the next player draws their card, or else it is already considered \\"dead\\". Once a player discards their card, the card underneath that card is now considered a \\"dead\\" card because it is no longer in the game. Players may not take these cards. =Jokers= Jokers are wild cards and can be played in the place of any card. A player is not allowed to have more jokers than face-cards in either a set or run. An example of this would be if one is trying to get a set he must have three or more cards of the same rank (8/8/8). But if a player has a joker or 2 he could play in place of an 8 (8/8/joker). But a player cannot lay more jokers than face-cards (8/joker/joker). However he may lay the same number of jokers as face-cards (8/8/joker/joker). The same applies for runs. If a player has laid down and has a joker in a run or set, the joker can be replaced by the appropriate card by any player. If a player who has not laid down yet replaces any joker he must lay down his meld in that turn, but if the player has already laid down his meld he may take the joker and use it how he chooses anytime. =Buying= A \\"buy\\" is when an out-of-turn player takes the upcard, draws 2 extra cards from the stock, and cannot play the cards immediately, but must wait for his turn. If more than one player wants it, the one closest to the dealer's left has precedence. There is a limit to the number of buys allowed. Each player is only allowed 3 buys per hand in the first 8 rounds. During rounds 9 and 10, each player is allowed 4 buys per hand. =Melding= The object of each hand is to come up with the correct combination of cards to be able to meld, or \\"lay out\\". The combination for each hand is different, and they become more difficult with each subsequent hand. The combinations for each hand are either sets or runs (sequence) or a combination of both. A set is a combination of a specific number of cards of the same rank, and the suit is not important. An example of a \\"set of 3\\" is three cards that are all 8's, and the 8's can all be of different suits. A run is a combination of a specific number of cards of the same suit that have consecutive ranks. An example of a \\"run of 4\\" is the 4, 5, 6, and 7 of clubs. An example of a combination for a hand is for hand #2, \\"1 set of 3 and 1 run of 4.\\" This means that a player must have both a set of 3 cards and a run of 4 cards in his hand before he can meld. A set needs a minimum of 3 cards while a run needs a minimum of 4 cards. A player can meld only when it is his turn. As always, he must start his hand by drawing a card, then when he has the correct sequence of cards, he can meld or \\"go down.\\" He does so by laying his meld cards face up on the table in their correct sequence. After melding, a player can then play on the melds of other players. When done, he must then discard. =Play for the player who has gone down= When a player is \\"down\\" (meaning he has already melded), he still takes his turn in turn with the other players, and he still must draw a card and discard. However, a player who is down cannot buy a card, nor can he stop a player from buying the top card in the discard pile when it is his turn. A player who is down can play his cards on the melds that have been completed either by himself or by other players. For example, if a player has laid down a set of 8's, and on a subsequent turn he then draws another 8, he can play this 8 on his set of 8's. He does this by placing the 8 with the set of 8's. If he has a card that he would like to play on a run, he must be sure to keep the order of the run. For example, if there is a run of 5 consisting of 4-5-6-7-8 of clubs, the player can play a 3 of clubs or a 9 of clubs. =Winning the game= Play progresses until the final hand when one of the players \\"goes out,\\" meaning he is able to play the last card in his hand. Although players may discard throughout the game, to win they must be able to lay down all of their cards without discarding. In order to win, on a player's turn they must be able to draw a card and then go out without a discard. The winner of the hand gets zero points, and the other players count their cards to determine their score for the hand. After all ten hands are played, the winner is the player with the lowest score.

The band's hits include \\"One Thing Leads to Another\\", \\"Saved by Zero\\", \\"Are We Ourselves?\\", and \\"Secret Separation\\", all of which made the U.S. Top 20, as well as early MTV Video hits \\"Red Skies\\" and \\"Stand or Fall\\" and mainstream rock chart hits \\"Driven Out\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", the latter of which was featured on the soundtrack of the 1984 film Streets of Fire.  Early years as Portraits and The Fix (1979-1981) College friends Cy Curnin on vocals and Adam Woods on drums formed the group in London in 1979, initially calling themselves Portraits. The pair placed an ad for additional members, and recruited keyboardist Rupert Greenall, guitarist Tony McGrail and bassist Russell Mckenzie later to be replaced by Charlie Barrett. Portraits issued two singles for Ariola Records: \\"Little Women\\" (1979), and \\"Hazards In The Home\\" (1980). Later in 1980, McGrail left. At this point, the band added guitarist Jamie West-Oram (formerly of Phillip Rambow's band) and changed their name to The Fix. This version of the band recorded for 101 Records, releasing their first single (\\"Lost Planes\\") in February 1981. This track, along with several live tracks issued by 101 on various compilations, received some radio exposure on the BBC. In these early days West-Oram was billed simply as 'Jamie West'. The Fix's raised profile eventually led to the group being offered a contract by MCA Records. Worried about the potential drug-user implication of the band's name, MCA insisted on a name change before signing them to the label. A compromise was reached as the band altered the spelling of their name to The Fixx, and a deal was duly inked. MCA and RCA years (1982-1991) Barrett left The Fixx just after the recording of their first album, Shuttered Room, in 1982. This album featured the band's initial hits, \\"Stand or Fall\\" and \\"Red Skies\\", both of which charted in the US and the UK. The band found particular success in Canada, where \\"Stand or Fall\\" reached No. 37. \\"Stand or Fall\\" entered the charts in the US on 30 October 1982. Barrett was replaced on bass by Alfie Agius for the Shuttered Room tour. Agius' stay in the band was short-lived, though, as he left during the 1983 recording of their next album Reach the Beach, after having recorded four tracks. Agius is credited as co- writer on all the album's tracks, but the group for this album was officially credited as a quartet (Curnin, Greenall, West-Oram and Woods). Agius went on to briefly tour with the hard rock/heavy metal band, Fastway that same year. Reach the Beach became the group's most commercially successful album and was certified Platinum by the RIAA on 5 January 1984. Agius' bass work is featured on the album's first two singles \\"Saved by Zero\\" and \\"One Thing Leads to Another.\\"Mann, Brent (2005). Blinded By the Lyrics. New York, NY: Citadel Press Books Both these singles cracked the US top 40, and \\"One Thing Leads To Another\\" became the band's biggest-ever hit (No. 1 Canada, No. 4 US). It was during these sessions that bassist Dan K. Brown joined the band. Brown played bass on the third top 40 single from the album, \\"The Sign Of Fire\\" and continued with the band on its subsequent tour. Brown became a full member of the band thereafter. Curnin and West-Oram played on \\"I Might Have Been Queen\\" and \\"Better Be Good To Me\\" by Tina Turner on her 1984 album Private Dancer. The 1984 album Phantoms contained the hits \\"Are We Ourselves?\\" (#29 Can.), the first video in which a mobile phone ever appeared (a modified Motorola KR999), and \\"Sunshine In The Shade.\\" Another single, \\"Deeper And Deeper,\\" was initially released as the B-side of \\"Are We Ourselves?\\" (and also appeared in an edited version on the soundtrack for the film Streets of Fire). This track received substantial airplay on U.S. and Canadian modern rock radio stations. In 1985 the Fixx recorded the song \\"A Letter to Both Sides\\" for the soundtrack of the film Fletch. In 1986, they released their fourth album Walkabout, featuring \\"Secret Separation\\" (No. 1 on Billboard Magazine's \\"Album Rock\\" chart, No. 49 in Canada) and \\"Built for the Future.\\" The 1987 album React, was a compilation of both live and new studio material, after which the band would depart MCA Records. In 1989,Though 1988 is listed as the copyright and publishing date on the initial pressings of Calm Animals, the booklet of Ultimate Collection notes January 1989 as the release date of its debut single \\"Driven Out\\". Additionally, The Fixx wrote on Twitter on February 7, 2015, \\"Back on this day....in 1989.....we released #CalmAnimals.....\\", implying that the album was released on February 7, 1989. the Fixx released their first album in nearly three years and only release on RCA Records, Calm Animals, which contained another hit \\"Driven Out\\" (another No. 1 on Billboard's \\"Album Rock\\" chart). The band returned to MCA for their next album, 1991's Ink. The album featured \\"How Much Is Enough?\\" (No. 27 Canada, No. 35 US). Post-major label years (1992-present) Dan K. Brown left the band in 1994. He was not officially replaced, and the band used session musicians on bass in his stead, with Chris Tait playing bass on most recordings and live shows from 1995 through the early 2000s. The four man line-up (with contributions from Tait and other sessioneers) recorded 1998's Elemental, as well as the 1999 album 1011 Woodland on which they re-recorded a selection of previous hits and album tracks. In 2002, the Fixx performed Nancy Sinatra's 1960s classic \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\" for an album of cover versions of songs from the 1960s to 1990s called When Pigs Fly. In 2003, the band released their ninth studio album, Want That Life. Gary Tibbs (formerly a member of Roxy Music, The Vibrators and Adam and the Ants) played bass for this album. Long-time bassist Dan K. Brown re-joined the band in 2008, replacing Tibbs. They celebrated 25 years of making music together, with the release of the double-CD Twenty-fifth Anniversary Anthology compilation. With the classic lineup back intact, the Fixx released their 10th studio album Beautiful Friction on 17 July 2012. The Fixx regularly tour the world.

Spectrohelioscope at Griffith Observatory, tuned to H-alpha Schematic of typical spectrohelioscope. The two slits oscillate rapidly to allow a portion of the Sun to be seen in monochromatic light. Many variations are possible: collimation can be done with concave mirrors, dispersion can be achieved with glass prisms, and scanning can be achieved with fixed slits and spinning square prisms. Because they are large (usually more than 3 meters long) and delicate, spectrohelioscopes are usually fixed, with moving mirrors to track the Sun The basic spectrohelioscope is a complex machine that uses a spectroscope to scan the surface of the Sun. The image from the objective lens is focused on a narrow slit revealing only a thin portion of the Sun's surface. The light is then passed through a prism or diffraction grating to spread the light into a spectrum. The spectrum is then focused on another slit that allows only a narrow part of the spectrum (the desired wavelength of light for viewing) to pass. The light is finally focused on an eyepiece so the surface of the Sun can be seen. The view, however, would be only a narrow strip of the Sun's surface. The slits are moved in unison to scan across the whole surface of the Sun giving a full image. Independently nodding mirrors can be used instead of moving slits to produce the same scan: the first mirror selects a slice of the Sun, the second selects the desired wavelength.

It was published on February 19, 1963 by W. W. Norton. In 1957, Friedan was asked to conduct a survey of her former Smith College classmates for their 15th anniversary reunion; the results, in which she found that many of them were unhappy with their lives as housewives, prompted her to begin research for The Feminine Mystique, conducting interviews with other suburban housewives, as well as researching psychology, media, and advertising. She originally intended to create an article on the topic, not a book, but no magazine would publish her article. During 1964, The Feminine Mystique became the bestselling nonfiction book with over one million copies sold. In the book, Friedan challenged the widely shared belief in the 1950s that \\"fulfillment as a woman had only one definition for American women after 1949—the housewife-mother.\\" The phrase \\"feminine mystique\\" was created by Friedan to show the assumptions that women would be fulfilled from their housework, marriage, sexual lives, and children. It was said that women, who were actually feminine, should not have wanted to work, get an education, or have political opinions. Friedan wanted to prove that women were unsatisfied but could not voice their feelings. Synopsis Betty Friedan (1960) The Feminine Mystique begins with an introduction describing what Friedan called \\"the problem that has no name\\"—the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s and early 1960s. It discusses the lives of several housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children. Furthermore, Friedan questioned the women's magazine, women's education system and advertisers for creating this widespread image of women. The detrimental effects induced by this image were that it narrowed women into the domestic sphere, and that it led many women to lose their own identities. Chapter 1: Friedan points out that the average age of marriage was dropping, the portion of women attending college was decreasing and the birthrate was increasing for women throughout the 1950s, yet the widespread trend of unhappy women persisted, although American culture insisted that fulfillment for women could be found in marriage and housewifery. Although aware of and sharing this dissatisfaction, women in the 1950s misinterpreted it as an individual problem and rarely talked about it with other women. As Friedan pointed out, \\"part of the strange newness of the problem is that it cannot be understood in terms of the age-old material problems of man: poverty, sickness, hunger, cold.\\" This chapter concludes by declaring \\"We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: 'I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.'\\" Chapter 2: Friedan states that the editorial decisions concerning women's magazines at the time were being made mostly by men, who insisted on stories and articles that showed women as either happy housewives or unhappy careerists, thus creating the \\"feminine mystique\\"—the idea that women were naturally fulfilled by devoting their lives to being housewives and mothers. Friedan also states that this is in contrast to the 1930s, at which time women's magazines often featured confident and independent heroines, many of whom were involved in careers. Chapter 3: Friedan recalls her own decision to conform to society's expectations by giving up her promising career in psychology to raise children, and shows that other young women still struggled with the same kind of decision. Many women dropped out of school early to marry, afraid that if they waited too long or became too educated, they would not be able to attract a husband. Friedan argues at the end of the chapter that although theorists discuss how men need to find their identity, women are expected to be autonomous. She states, \\"Anatomy is woman's destiny, say the theorists of femininity; the identity of woman is determined by her biology.\\" Friedan goes on to argue that the problem is women needing to mature and find their human identity. She argues, \\"In a sense that goes beyond any woman's life, I think this is a crisis of women growing up—a turning point from an immaturity that has been called femininity to full human identity.\\" Chapter 4: Friedan discusses early American feminists and how they fought against the assumption that the proper role of a woman was to be solely a wife and mother. She notes that they secured important rights for women, including education, the right to pursue a career, and the right to vote. Chapter 5: In this chapter, Friedan, who had a degree in psychology, criticizes the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (whose ideas were very influential in the United States at the time of the book's publication). She notes that Freud saw women as childlike and as destined to be housewives, once pointing out that Freud wrote, \\"I believe that all reforming action in law and education would break down in front of the fact that, long before the age at which a man can earn a position in society, Nature has determined woman's destiny through beauty, charm, and sweetness. Law and custom have much to give women that has been withheld from them, but the position of women will surely be what it is: in youth an adored darling and in mature years a loved wife.\\" Friedan also points out that Freud's unproven concept of \\"penis envy\\" had been used to label women who wanted careers as neurotic, and that the popularity of Freud's work and ideas elevated the \\"feminine mystique\\" of female fulfillment in housewifery into a \\"scientific religion\\" that most women were not educated enough to criticize. Chapter 6: Friedan criticizes functionalism, which attempted to make the social sciences more credible by studying the institutions of society as if they were parts of a social body, as in biology. Institutions were studied in terms of their function in society, and women were confined to their sexual biological roles as housewives and mothers as well as being told that doing otherwise would upset the social balance. Friedan points out that this is unproven and that Margaret Mead, a prominent functionalist, had a flourishing career as an anthropologist. Chapter 7: Friedan discusses the change in women's education from the 1940s to the early 1960s, in which many women's schools concentrated on non-challenging classes that focused mostly on marriage, family, and other subjects deemed suitable for women, as educators influenced by functionalism felt that too much education would spoil women's femininity and capacity for sexual fulfillment. Friedan says that this change in education arrested girls in their emotional development at a young age, because they never had to face the painful identity crisis and subsequent maturation that comes from dealing with many adult challenges. Chapter 8: Friedan notes that the uncertainties and fears during World War II and the Cold War made Americans long for the comfort of home, so they tried to create an idealized home life with the father as breadwinner and the mother as housewife. Friedan notes that this was helped along by the fact that many of the women who worked during the war filling jobs previously filled by men faced dismissal, discrimination, or hostility when the men returned, and that educators blamed over-educated, career-focused mothers for the maladjustment of soldiers in World War II. Yet as Friedan shows, later studies found that overbearing mothers, not careerists, were the ones who raised maladjusted children. Chapter 9: Friedan shows that advertisers tried to encourage housewives to think of themselves as professionals who needed many specialized products in order to do their jobs, while discouraging housewives from having actual careers, since that would mean they would not spend as much time and effort on housework and therefore would not buy as many household products, cutting into advertisers' profits. Chapter 10: Friedan interviews several full-time housewives, finding that although they are not fulfilled by their housework, they are all extremely busy with it. She postulates that these women unconsciously stretch their home duties to fill the time available, because the feminine mystique has taught women that this is their role, and if they ever complete their tasks they will become unneeded. Chapter 11: Friedan notes that many housewives have sought fulfillment in sex, unable to find it in housework and children; Friedan notes that sex cannot fulfill all of a person's needs, and that attempts to make it do so often drive married women to have affairs or drive their husbands away as they become obsessed with sex. Chapter 12: Friedan discusses the fact that many children have lost interest in life or emotional growth, attributing the change to the mother's own lack of fulfillment, a side effect of the feminine mystique. When the mother lacks a self, Friedan notes, she often tries to live through her children, causing the children to lose their own sense of themselves as separate human beings with their own lives. Chapter 13: Friedan discusses the psychologist Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and notes that women have been trapped at the basic, physiological level, expected to find their identity through their sexual role alone. Friedan says that women need meaningful work just as men do to achieve self-actualization, the highest level on the hierarchy of needs. Chapter 14: In the final chapter of The Feminine Mystique, Friedan discusses several case studies of women who have begun to go against the feminine mystique. She also advocates a new life plan for her women readers, including not viewing housework as a career, not trying to find total fulfillment through marriage and motherhood alone, and finding meaningful work that uses their full mental capacity. She discusses the conflicts that some women may face in this journey to self-actualization, including their own fears and resistance from others. For each conflict, Friedan offers examples of women who have overcome it. Friedan ends her book by promoting education and meaningful work as the ultimate method by which American women can avoid becoming trapped in the feminine mystique, calling for a drastic rethinking of what it means to be feminine, and offering several educational and occupational suggestions. Intended sequel Friedan originally intended to write a sequel to The Feminine Mystique, which was to be called Woman: The Fourth Dimension, but instead only wrote an article by that name, which appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal in June 1964.American National Biography Online: Friedan, Betty Influences Friedan's chapter on Freud was inspired by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949). Legacy The Feminine Mystique drew large numbers of white, middle-class women to the feminist cause. Her book \\"took the complicated and jargon-laden ideas of psychologists, economists, and political theorists, and translated them into powerful, readable, relatable prose that touched millions.\\" Politicians began to recognize the frustrations of women due in part to Betty Friedan. In 1963 the commission appointed to review the status of women recommended an end to inequities. Legislation followed. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 stipulated that women receive the same pay as men for the same work. NOW (The National Organization for Women) was organized in 1966 with 30 women from different backgrounds; Friedan was one of them, and helped draft the founding statement of NOW. The statement called for \\"the true equality for all women\\". NOW demanded the removal of all barriers to \\"equal and economic advance\\". Friedan's influence can be seen in the founding statement; a main emphasis of the book is \\"women's need for identity and autonomy\\", and NOW's statement says \\"NOW is dedicated to the proposition that women first and foremost are human beings, who… must have the chance to develop their fullest human potential.\\" The Feminine Mystique is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century, and is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Futurist Alvin Toffler declared that it \\"pulled the trigger on history.\\" Friedan received hundreds of letters from unhappy housewives after its publication, and she herself went on to help found, and become the first president of the National Organization for Women, an influential feminist organization. In addition to its contribution to feminism, The Feminine Mystique related to many other coinciding movements. \\"Her work indicates for us the ways that feminism was interconnected with the struggles of working-class men and women, with black and Jewish battles against racism and anti-Semitism… As a result, The Feminine Mystique had substantial impact on a wide range of political activists, thinkers, and ordinary individuals.\\" By the year 2000, The Feminine Mystique had sold more than 3 million copies and had been translated into many foreign languages. On February 22 and 23, 2013, a symposium titled React: The Feminine Mystique at 50, co-sponsored by The New School for Public Engagement and The Parsons School of Design, was held.Media Coverage of the Feminine Mystique Symposium New Location - React: The Feminine Mystique at 50 (Day 1)  The New School  University Events An accompanying exhibit titled REACT was also on display, consisting of twenty-five pieces of artwork responding to The Feminine Mystique. Also in February 2013, a fiftieth-anniversary edition of The Feminine Mystique was published, with a new introduction by Gail Collins.The Feminine Mystique  W. W. Norton & Company Also in 2013, to celebrate its centennial the U.S. Department of Labor created a list of over 100 Books that Shaped Work in America, which included The Feminine Mystique.The Department of Labor Chose 100+ Books that Shaped Work in America The Department of Labor later chose The Feminine Mystique as one of its top ten books from that list. Also in 2013, The Feminine Mystique was discussed in Makers: Women Who Make America.Kelly, Kate (February 25, 2013). \\"New PBS Program Makers Puts Women's Movement in Context\\". The Huffington Post. In 2014 the Betty Friedan Hometown Tribute committee won the Superior Achievement award in the special projects category for its 50th anniversary celebration of the publication of The Feminine Mystique. They received the award from the Illinois State Historical Society. Criticism From immediately after its publishing and continuing until even now, The Feminine Mystique has been the recipient of much backlash against feminism. Significant numbers of women responded angrily to the book, which they felt implied that wives and mothers could never be fulfilled. \\"Women who valued their roles as mothers and housewives interpreted Friedan's message as one that threatened their stability, devalued their labor, and disrespected their intelligence.\\" In a Letter to Editor in McCall's, one woman wrote, \\"All this time I thought I was happy, and a nice person. Now I discover I've been miserable and some sort of monster in disguise—now out of disguise. How awful!\\" Another said, \\"Mrs. Friedan should save her pity for those who really need it—the half starved, oppressed people in the world.\\" When women critical of the work were not expressing personal offense at Friedan's description of the housewife's plight, they were accusing her of planning to destroy American families. Jessica Weiss quoted in her paper, \\"If the mothers, (or housewives as we are called) took this advice, what would become of our children? Or better yet, the future of the world.\\" Historian Joanne Meyerowitz argues that many of the contemporary magazines and articles of the period did not place women solely in the home, as Friedan stated, but in fact supported the notions of full- or part-time jobs for women seeking to follow a career path rather than being a housewife.Joanne Meyerowitz, \\"Beyond The Feminine Mystique: A Reassessment of Postwar Mass Culture, 1946–1958\\", Journal of American History 79 (March 1993): 1455–1482. p. 1459 These articles did, however, still emphasize the importance of maintaining the traditional image of femininity. Daniel Horowitz, a Professor of American Studies at Smith College, points out that although Friedan presented herself as a typical suburban housewife, she was involved with radical politics and labor journalism in her youth, and during the time she wrote The Feminine Mystique she worked as a freelance journalist for women's magazines and as a community organizer.Horowitz, Daniel. \\"Rethinking Betty Friedan and The Feminine Mystique: Labor Union Radicalism and Feminism in Cold War America.\\" American Quarterly, Volume 48, Number 1, March 1996, pp. 1-42 The W. W. Norton publishing house, where Betty Friedan's work was initially circulated to be published as a book also generated some criticism. In fact an employee under the alias \\"L M\\" wrote in a two-page memo that Friedan's theoretical views were \\"too obvious and feminine\\", as well as critiquing her approach by suggesting it to be unscientific. In addition, Friedan has been criticized for focusing solely on the plight of middle-class white women, and not giving enough attention to the differing situations encountered by women in less stable economic situations, or women of other races. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine, \\"women of color—African American, Latina, Asian American and Native American women—were completely absent from Friedan's vision, as were white working-class and poor women.\\" Despite being written during the Civil Rights Movement, Friedan's text \\"barely mentions African-American women.\\" She has also been criticized for prejudice against homosexuality.Daniel Horowitz, \\"Rethinking Betty Friedan and The Feminine Mystique: Labor Union Radicalism and Feminism in Cold War America\\", American Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 1 (Mar. 1996) p. 22 In part, this criticism stems from her adherence to the paradigmatic belief at the time that \\"bad mothers\\" caused deviance from heteronormative and cisnormative society (as in, \\"bad mothers\\" caused people to be LGBTQ+). She continued this trend by resisting efforts by the National Organization of Women, of which she was the first president, to integrate lesbians' rights into their platform. Despite these criticisms, her \\"language aimed at white American middle-class women won large numbers of supporters to the feminist cause,\\" implying perhaps that Friedan's decision to exclude other groups was deliberate in mobilizing a group of women that had in some cases not thought of the improvement of their rights. In 2005, conservative magazine Human Events included The Feminine Mystique on its list of \\"Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries\\" as number seven.

The 92nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. The Yankees defeated the Braves, four games to two, to capture their first World Series title since 1978 and their 23rd World Series championship overall. The series was played from October 20–26, 1996, and was broadcast on television on Fox. Yankees relief pitcher John Wetteland was named the World Series Most Valuable Player for saving all four Yankee wins. The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, three games to one, and then the Baltimore Orioles in the AL Championship Series, four games to one. It was the Yankees' first appearance in a World Series since 1981. The Braves advanced to the Series by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series, three games to none, and then the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series, four games to three. It was the Braves' second consecutive appearance in a World Series. The Yankees lost the first two games at home, being outscored by the Braves, 16–1. However, they rebounded to win the next four games, the last three in close fashion, including a dramatic comeback win in Game 4 to tie the series. They became the third team to win a World Series after losing Games 1 and 2 at their home stadium, following the Kansas City Royals in 1985 and the New York Mets in 1986. They also became the first team since the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981 to win four consecutive games in a World Series after losing the first two. As of 2019, this is the last time any team has lost Games 1 & 2 at home in a best-of-seven series (LCS or World Series) and come back to win the series. Game 5 was the final game to be played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, as the Braves moved into Turner Field the following season. Atlanta became the only city to host the World Series and the Olympics in the same year and Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium became the only stadium to host baseball in an Olympics and the World Series in the same year. Background The 1996 World Series marked the beginning of the New York Yankees' dynasty of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Despite the rich playoff history of the Yankees, the defending champion Atlanta Braves entered the Series as heavy favorites. The Yankees had reached the Fall Classic after their ALCS victory over the Baltimore Orioles, while the Braves had rallied from a 3–1 deficit to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS. The Braves used the dominant pitching of Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, as well as timely hitting, to defeat the Indians the year before, and looked to reuse that recipe against the upstart Yankees. In 1996, John Smoltz returned to form, winning 24 games and a Cy Young Award, providing another serious pitching threat for Atlanta. New York brought a lineup mixed with veterans, like Paul O'Neill, and young stars, like rookie Derek Jeter. The Yankees bullpen was also vastly superior to the Atlanta bullpen, which would prove to be the deciding factor in the Series. After victory in 1996, New York would go on to win the Series three of the next four years, two of which came against either their cross-town rivals, New York Mets, or the Braves, making their dynasty of the 1990s part of the rivalry between both National League East teams. The Braves, while winning their division every season from 1991 through 2005, have not won a World Series game since Game 2 of this series. Over the course of the 1996 World Series, the Braves hit .315 during the first six innings and .176 afterward. Atlanta had more hits, runs, homers, and a lower team ERA during the course of the series, but still lost, much like the 1960 Yankees' performance against the Pittsburgh Pirates. This is the first World Series to feature the series logo on the side of each team's hats. This was also the last of four consecutive World Series (1992–1996) to be presided over jointly by the presidents of the American and National Leagues in lieu of the Commissioner of Baseball, as Paul Beeston would be named CEO of Major League Baseball for the 1997 Major League Baseball season. Following Game 6, then-American League president Gene Budig presided over the Commissioner's Trophy presentation to the Yankees. Then-Chairman of the Executive Committee (and de facto Commissioner) Bud Selig, who had presided over the trophy presentations in and would do so again in , officially became Commissioner in 1998. Summary Matchups =Game 1= Game 1 and Game 2 were originally scheduled for Saturday, October 19 and Sunday, October 20, respectively. Rain on October 19, however, washed out Game 1. The schedule was moved back one day, with Game 1 and Game 2 rescheduled for October 20 and 21, and the Monday travel day eliminated. This was the first time weather resulted in a postponement since the 1986 World Series, where Game 7 was delayed one day due to inclement weather. The game was a matchup of league wins leaders. The Yankees sent out lefthander Andy Pettitte, who in only his second full season in the major leagues had won 21 games and made the American League All-Star Team. For the Braves went veteran John Smoltz, who won a career high 24 games and led the National League in strikeouts. Entering the World Series, Atlanta had completed a comeback from a 3-1 deficit and beaten the St. Louis Cardinals by a margin of 32-1 in the three previous games. They continued their offensive onslaught in Game One. In the second inning, rookie Braves outfielder Andruw Jones stepped to the plate with catcher Javy Lopez on base and two out. The 19-year old native of Curaçao drove a full count pitch over the left field fence to open the scoring. In doing this he broke the record held by Mickey Mantle of being the youngest player in World Series history to hit a home run in his first Series at-bat. One inning later, the defending champions broke the game open. Jeff Blauser and Marquis Grissom opened the top of the third with singles, and were moved into scoring position by a sacrifice bunt from Mark Lemke. Chipper Jones then singled to score the runners, advancing to second on a throw to the plate. While Fred McGriff batted, Jones stole third base and then scored himself when McGriff followed his single with one of his own. After issuing a walk to Lopez, Pettitte was pulled from the game with Yankees manager Joe Torre calling on Brian Boehringer to get out of the jam his team was in. With his team now trailing by five runs, Boehringer faced Jermaine Dye and got him to fly out to left. However, once again the young outfielder from the Caribbean came through as Andruw Jones hit his second home run in the next at-bat to make the score 8-0. McGriff later added his own home run off Boehringer in the fifth which struck the right field foul pole with a loud clang. The Yankees' offense, meanwhile, had been unable to do much against Smoltz. Entering their half of the fifth, they had yet to record a hit and, despite Smoltz recording four walks, had stranded every baserunner that they had managed to get on. In the fifth, they did break through for their first run when veteran third baseman Wade Boggs drove in rookie sensation Derek Jeter with a double. The Braves closed out the scoring in the sixth. Andruw Jones singled off of Boehringer and Ryan Klesko reached on an error by second baseman Mariano Duncan. After Blauser's fly ball out advanced Jones to third, Grissom and Lemke recorded consecutive hits to drive in the baserunners and make the score 11-1. David Weathers came in with runners now on the corners and one out, then gave up a sacrifice fly out that scored Grissom. Smoltz pitched six innings to get the victory, recording the single run on two hits. Relievers Greg McMichael, Denny Neagle, Terrell Wade, and Brad Clontz held the Yankees scoreless in the final three innings. Pettitte, in his first World Series start, took the loss after being charged with seven of the 12 Braves runs in 2.2 innings of work. Andruw Jones, with his two home runs in the first at bats, joined Gene Tenace as the only other player to homer in his first two World Series at bats. =Game 2= Game 2 of the series saw the Braves turn to four-time defending Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux to start. The Yankees trotted out one of their few pitchers that actually had World Series experience, the veteran Jimmy Key. Just before signing with the Yankees as a free agent in 1993, Key had defeated the Braves twice in the 1992 World Series, including in the Series-clincher, while pitching for the Toronto Blue Jays. As they had in Game 1, the Yankees again struggled against a strong Braves starter. Maddux pitched eight shutout innings and, despite giving up six hits, only allowed two runners to reach third base the entire time he was on the mound. Despite only striking out two batters, he managed to retire most of the hitters he faced on ground ball outs; he also did not walk a batter, only allowing one additional runner to reach when he hit Derek Jeter with a pitch in the third inning. Key, meanwhile, had trouble getting Fred McGriff out with runners on base. In the first inning, following a pitch Key thought was a strike, McGriff singled with two outs to drive home Mark Lemke, who had hit a ground-rule double earlier. Then, in the third inning, McGriff came up with Marquis Grissom at third and singled again, driving the second Atlanta run in. Finally, in the fifth, McGriff drove in his third run of the game by hitting a sacrifice fly to score Lemke from third with nobody out. The Braves' fourth run came when Grissom singled off of Key in the sixth to drive in Terry Pendleton. Mark Wohlers, a long-time Brave reliever of postseasons past who was now the team's closer, relieved Maddux in the ninth and struck out Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez, and Paul O'Neill to end the game and put the Braves up 2-0 heading back to Atlanta. After the game, Yankees manager Joe Torre and his first base coach José Cardenal met with owner George Steinbrenner, furious at the team's performance in the World Series so far. At that post-game meeting, Torre guaranteed three victories in Atlanta and then bringing the series back to Yankee Stadium to clinch at home. Steinbrenner doubted Torre, saying, \\"If you guys can't beat the Braves at home, you surely can't beat them down in Atlanta.\\" This is, as of 2019, the Braves' most recent victory in a World Series game, as they would go on to lose the next four in this Series, be swept by the Yankees in 1999 and have not appeared in a Fall Classic since. =Game 3= The Yankees decided to shake their lineup up prior to Game 3 in an attempt to get themselves out of the slump they experienced in the first two games. Manager Joe Torre took veterans Paul O'Neill, Wade Boggs, and Tino Martinez out of the lineup. Replacing Boggs at third base was Charlie Hayes, while Darryl Strawberry took O'Neill's spot in right field. After starting him as the designated hitter in the first two games, Torre decided to keep Cecil Fielder in the lineup and had him replace Martinez at first base. With the Braves looking to make it a 3-0 lead in the series, they sent veteran Tom Glavine to the mound to start Game 3. He had started the most recent World Series game in Atlanta, the 1-0 shutout in Game 6 in 1995 which he won and which helped him earn the series MVP award. The Yankees' starter, meanwhile, was returning from nearly having his career end. David Cone had signed a three-year contract to stay with the Yankees after he was traded to them by Toronto during the 1995 season. He started off the season pitching well, but was discovered to have an aneurysm in his pitching arm and forced to miss most of the season. He did manage to come back toward the end of the season and was kept on the postseason roster. Cone was also previously experienced in World Series play, having played for the same 1992 Blue Jays team as Game 2 starter Jimmy Key; he managed two no-decisions in both of his prior starts. The Yankees got the first run of the game in their first turn at bat. Tim Raines led off with a walk and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt from Derek Jeter. Bernie Williams drove him in with a single. The Yankees added another in the fourth inning. After Williams reached on a Jeff Blauser error, he would advance on a walk to Fielder and then a line drive to the right that Andruw Jones caught. Strawberry drove in the unearned run with a single; and after Mariano Duncan struck out, Joe Girardi drew a walk to put two runners on for Cone. Cone did manage to make contact, but hit the ball right at a stumbling Chipper Jones who touched third base to end the inning. Cone led off the sixth inning with a walk to Glavine, followed by a single to Marquis Grissom. After retiring Mark Lemke on a failed bunt attempt, Cone loaded the bases by walking Chipper Jones. Fred McGriff popped out to Jeter for the second out, but Ryan Klesko drew a walk to force in Glavine and cut the lead to 2–1. Cone got Javy López to pop out to Girardi to end the inning, closing his night. Glavine would be done after the seventh, giving up only four hits and the earned run in the first and unearned run in the fourth. In the eighth inning the Yankees put the game out of reach. Jeter reached on a single off Greg McMichael and Williams hit a home run following that, extending the lead to 4–1. After Fielder doubled, Brad Clontz came in and retired Hayes. He then walked Strawberry, only to give up another run with a single from defensive replacement Luis Sojo. The Braves tried to rally in the bottom half and got a run back off Mariano Rivera on back-to-back doubles by Grissom and Lemke. Rivera managed to strike out Chipper Jones, but with McGriff and Klesko looming Torre brought in lefthander Graeme Lloyd, who retired them both. Neither team threatened in the ninth and the Yankees got their much needed win. Cone won his first World Series decision in three tries; he had previously recorded two no-decisions in the 1992 World Series. Glavine lost what would be his only start in the series that year, while Yankee closer John Wetteland received his first save. =Game 4= The original intent for both teams entering the series was to use a short pitching rotation, which would have consisted of the front three starters (Smoltz, Maddux, and Glavine for Atlanta and Pettitte, Key, and Cone for New York) each making starts on three days rest. However, since Game 1 was postponed and the teams would have to play a potential five consecutive days, that was no longer possible. So, for Game 4, both the Yankees and Braves were forced to adjust their starting pitching lineup. Denny Neagle, who saw action in Game 1, was the starter for Atlanta. Acquired at midseason from the Pittsburgh Pirates to shore up the rotation, he did not perform well during the regular season and had no record in the postseason, but pitched decently in the NLCS allowing only two hits and two runs in two appearances and one start. Kenny Rogers got the start for the Yankees. He had been signed away from the Texas Rangers in the off-season, where he had just made his first All-Star team, and was one of the major acquisitions the Yankees made. However, Rogers only won 12 games during the regular season and pitched poorly during the postseason, being pulled early in his Division Series and ALCS starts. Rogers' struggles continued in the World Series. In the bottom of the second Fred McGriff led off with a home run to open the scoring. After Javy López and Andruw Jones walked, Jermaine Dye sacrificed Lopez to third. Jeff Blauser followed with a bunt single to score Lopez, and, after Neagle bunted to advance Jones and Blauser, Marquis Grissom doubled them in to give Atlanta an early 4–0 lead. Rogers was pulled after allowing Chipper Jones and McGriff to reach base to begin the third, and was charged with a fifth run when Brian Boehringer gave up a sacrifice fly to Lopez which enabled Jones to score. The Braves extended their lead to 6–0 as Andruw Jones drove in Chipper Jones with a double in the fifth off David Weathers. Meanwhile, Neagle was pitching shutout ball and the Yankees had only gotten two hits through five innings. The sixth inning, however, proved to be troublesome. Derek Jeter led off and hit a foul pop near first base. As McGriff and Mark Lemke chased the ball from the infield, right fielder Dye came in and the ball appeared to be playable for him. However, umpire Tim Welke had his back to Dye and inadvertently blocked him from getting to the ball, causing it to simply drop foul. Jeter promptly singled to start a three run rally, capped by a Dye error in right on a Cecil Fielder single that allowed two runs to score. After Charlie Hayes drove in Fielder, Neagle was pulled in favor of reliever Terrell Wade, who walked Darryl Strawberry and was promptly pulled in favor of Mike Bielecki, who struck out the next three batters and then retired the Yankees in the seventh. Bielecki retired six of the seven batters he faced, striking out four total. Although the Braves were still leading, the deficit had been cut in half and a decision by Braves manager Bobby Cox proved a critical mistake. Wanting to shut down the Yankees rally and give his team a chance to clinch the series the following night, Cox called upon Mark Wohlers in the eighth inning. Hayes led off the inning with a dribbler down the third base line that the Braves let go, hoping it would roll foul. It did not, and Strawberry followed that up with a line drive single to left to advance Hayes to second. Mariano Duncan then hit a ground ball to Rafael Belliard at short, which looked like a double play. Belliard did not field the ball cleanly, however, and was only able to get Strawberry out at second. With one out and runners on the corners, the Yankees brought Jim Leyritz, who entered the game in the sixth as a defensive replacement for catcher Joe Girardi, to the plate for the first time. Leyritz later said he felt he had an advantage because Wohlers was such a hard thrower and he was a solid fastball hitter. As such, he went up looking for a pitch to hit and with the count even at 2-2, Leyritz drove a Wohlers slider over the left field wall to tie the game at six.1996 World Series Official Film, ©1996 Major League Baseball Productions Wohlers finished the inning by inducing groundouts from Mike Aldrete and Tim Raines, but the save was blown. Mariano Rivera came in for the bottom of the eighth and immediately gave up a single to Andruw Jones. Dye followed up with a sacrifice bunt to move him into scoring position. However, pinch hitter Luis Polonia struck out and Rivera got backup catcher Eddie Perez to ground out, stranding Jones and keeping the game tied entering the ninth. After recording the first two outs in the top half, Wohlers gave up back to back singles to Fielder and Hayes in the top half and then gave up an infield hit to Strawberry which loaded the bases. However, he got out of the jam when Duncan hit a short fly ball to Dye. After getting Grissom to pop out to start the home ninth, Rivera gave up a hit to Lemke and walked Chipper Jones. Joe Torre then lifted Rivera as he had the night before, once again calling on Graeme Lloyd to face McGriff. Lloyd once again rewarded his manager's faith in him by inducing McGriff to hit into a double play, sending the game into extra innings. For the top of the tenth, Steve Avery came on to pitch for the Braves. Avery was another veteran of the Braves' postseason past and had been an integral part of their starting rotation for several years, including in 1991 when he won the NLCS Most Valuable Player award. However, after making the All-Star Team in 1993 his career had taken a downward slide and by 1996 Avery was limited to relief duties in the postseason. He was tasked with keeping the game tied against the bottom of the Yankees lineup, and started out doing just that as he retired Leyritz and Lloyd. Avery then followed that up by walking Tim Raines on four pitches. Jeter followed with a single, and with two runners on base Cox decided again to play strategy. Bernie Williams was the batter and the fourth spot in the order was due next. That had been occupied by Fielder, but Torre had elected to pull him for pinch-runner Andy Fox during the seventh. Cox elected to intentionally walk Williams to load the bases. Torre responded by calling Fox back to the dugout and sent up the struggling Wade Boggs to try and drive in the go-ahead run. Although Avery managed to get two early strikes on him, Boggs managed to wait out Avery and draw a walk on a full-count pitch, scoring Raines and giving the Yankees their first lead of the game. With his strategy having backfired, Cox made a double switch and brought in Brad Clontz to pitch, while Ryan Klesko replaced McGriff at first base. The next batter, Hayes, hit a pop fly that Klesko lost sight of and dropped, which scored Jeter and closed out the scoring. Lloyd retired Klesko to lead off the home tenth, then gave way to closer John Wetteland, who gave up a single to Andruw Jones but recorded two flyouts off the bats of Dye and Terry Pendleton to get his second save of the postseason. Lloyd was credited with the win, with Avery suffering the loss. \\"It was our game to win and we had our chances,\\" Avery said. \\"I ended up costing us the game.\\"Lighten up, Bobby, you can't hide and Ted's got the check This was the second biggest comeback in World Series history. In 1929, the Philadelphia Athletics scored ten runs in the seventh inning to defeat the Chicago Cubs 10–8 in Game 4. This was also the last time all four games were won by the road team until the 2019 World Series between the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals. =Game 5= With the series tied and both teams guaranteed to return to New York, the Yankees and Braves took to the field for what was to be the final game ever played inside Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. As part of the planning that went into Atlanta’s winning bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, the main venue for the Games, Centennial Olympic Stadium, would be immediately reconfigured as a baseball stadium once the Olympics and Paralympics were over; the stadium, which was placed adjacent to its soon-to-be predecessor, would be renamed Turner Field and the Braves would begin play there once the 1997 season began. The pitching matchup featured a rematch of the Game 1 starters, with John Smoltz looking to give the Braves the series lead while Andy Pettitte sought to atone for his poor performance in Game 1 and give the Yankees the opportunity to clinch the series at home in Game 6. Unlike in Game 1, where the Braves routed the Yankees by a 12-1 margin, Game 5 proved to be a classic pitcher’s duel. In fact, only one run was scored by either team. That came in the top of the fourth inning, with Charlie Hayes leading off. He lifted a fly ball to right center field that Marquis Grissom seemed to have an easy play on. However, as he was coming toward right field, Jermaine Dye was coming from the left and crossed in front of Grissom. Grissom consequently lost sight of the ball and it dropped between him and Dye, and Hayes advanced to second base on the error. Two batters later, Cecil Fielder hit a double to drive in Hayes and give the Yankees the lead. The Yankees threatened again in the sixth. After Bernie Williams struck out to start the inning, Fielder singled. Darryl Strawberry drew a walk, and Paul O'Neill grounded out to advance the runners to second and third. Smoltz struck out Mariano Duncan to end the inning. Through five innings Pettitte had only allowed one hit, a single off the bat of Andruw Jones, and Grissom had been the only other Brave to reach base. But in the home half of the sixth, Atlanta threatened. Smoltz and Grissom reached base and Mark Lemke was asked to bunt to try and advance the runners so that Chipper Jones, batting next, could come up with an opportunity to drive them both in. Facing the possibility of having the go-ahead runs in scoring position with one out, Pettitte got Lemke to bunt the ball to the third base side of the mound. Since Pettitte was left-handed, this meant he had an easier shot at getting the lead runner than he might have of throwing to first in time and he used that advantage to beat a sliding Smoltz to third with his throw. Jones then hit Pettitte's first pitch right back to him, starting a 1-4-3 double play to retire the side. Smoltz would pitch two more innings, allowing two baserunners in the seventh; he retired Jim Leyritz on a fielder's choice play with Pettitte batting and then got Derek Jeter to lineout to Fred McGriff at first, who doubled off Pettitte to end the inning. After retiring the Yankees in order in the eighth he was lifted for a pinch hitter; he only would allow four hits and strike out ten batters, with the lone unearned run counting against him. For the ninth inning, Braves manager Bobby Cox brought in his closer, Mark Wohlers, to try and hold the Yankees to the one-run lead they'd held since the fourth. After retiring Strawberry on a groundout, he walked O'Neill. Duncan followed with a fielder's choice that retired O'Neill, then stole second base to put himself in scoring position. That made for a shift in strategy for the Braves. With Leyritz standing in the batter’s box and two out, first base was open. The pitcher’a spot was due next, and Pettitte was in fact standing in the on deck circle. Cox decided to call Joe Torre‘s bluff, since closer John Wetteland was loosening up in the Yankee bullpen, and called for an intentional walk to see what Torre was going to do. The call did not go completely as planned, as Wohlers threw a wild pitch on the intended play and Duncan advanced to third. Torre elected not to go to his bench, and sent up his ace to face the hard-throwing Wohlers. Although Pettitte was retired on a flyout to end the inning, it was not a matter of whether or not he would reach base. Instead, it showed that Torre had enough confidence in Pettitte to at least send him out for the bottom of the ninth to finish the shutout. The Braves immediately responded in their half. Chipper Jones hit a line drive to left field and was able to reach second without a throw, putting the tying run in scoring position. After McGriff grounded out, Torre decided to make the change and brought Wetteland into the game to face Javy López. After he induced a groundout off the bat of López, Wetteland faced Ryan Klesko, came up to pinch hit for Andruw Jones, but Torre decided to walk him intentionally. With the winning runs now on base, Cox again went to his bench and called back the young outfielder Dye. Luis Polonia, a former Yankee, was sent up to pinch hit. After fighting off seven pitches, all foul balls, Polonia lifted a fly ball deep to right. O’Neill, who was playing with sore legs the entire series, was able to chase down the ball and caught it on the warning track, then slapped the wall with his glove in celebration as the Yankees took the victory. The loss suffered by Smoltz was his first in seven career World Series starts; he had two victories, in Game 5 in 1992 and Game 1 of this series, and four no-decisions prior to this. He would only pitch in one more World Series, the 1999 rematch between these two teams; he took the loss in the decisive fourth game at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees became the first team to sweep the middle three games of the World Series since the Braves themselves did it in (although the Braves won all three games at Fulton County Stadium in the 1991 Series; the home team won all seven games of that series). The Braves joined the 1905 Philadelphia Athletics, the 1921 New York Yankees and the World Series champion New York Mets as the only teams to lose a 1–0 World Series game on an unearned run. =Game 6= Prior to Game 6, Yankees manager Joe Torre's brother Frank underwent heart transplant surgery. The Yankees, seeking to clinch their first world championship since and the first for a New York City baseball team since the Mets won in , faced off against Greg Maddux in a rematch of the Game 2 starters, as Jimmy Key took to the hill for the Yankees. The Braves, for the third time in their four World Series visits thus far in the 1990s, were facing an elimination game. The Yankees struck against Maddux in the bottom of the third inning. Paul O'Neill led off the frame with a double and advanced to third on a groundout by Mariano Duncan. Joe Girardi then hit a flyball to center field that Marquis Grissom misjudged, which scored O'Neill and gave Girardi a triple. He scored on a single by Derek Jeter, and after stealing second Jeter scored on a single by Bernie Williams. These were the only three runs Maddux gave up in the series, but they were costly. Maddux pitched the next innings without giving up another run. The Braves got a run back in the top of the fourth as Fred McGriff reached on a walk. Javy López and Andruw Jones followed with back to back singles to load the bases, and Jermaine Dye drew a walk to force in the run. Key got out of the bases loaded jam by getting designated hitter Terry Pendleton to ground into a double play to end the inning. The top of the fifth inning saw another umpiring controversy. With Mark Lemke at the plate and one out, Girardi dropped a pitch from Key. Grissom tried to advance and Girardi's throw was late and replays clearly showed Grissom to be safe, but umpire Terry Tata called Grissom out. Atlanta manager Bobby Cox emerged from the dugout and began arguing the call to no avail. On his way back to the dugout Cox turned his ire to third base umpire Tim Welke, with the incident involving Welke's accidental interference in Game 4 still fresh in his mind. Welke threw Cox out of the game, marking the first managerial ejection in the World Series since . Incidentally, Cox was also on the receiving end in the previous instance; he had been ejected for throwing a batting helmet from the dugout to protest a strikeout call (Fox and the video recap of the series erroneously reported that Whitey Herzog's ejection in the 1985 World Series had been the last time). It was the last ejection of a manager in a World Series game until the 2019 World Series, when Dave Martinez of the Washington Nationals was also thrown out of the game in game 6. New York manager Joe Torre pulled Key from the game in the top of the sixth with one out and Chipper Jones--who had opened the inning with a double--on third. David Weathers came in to pitch to Lopez and retired him. Then after a walk to Andruw Jones and Ryan Klesko coming in to pinch hit for Dye the Yankees went to Graeme Lloyd to pitch to Klesko, who did not have a hit against Lloyd in the series. Lloyd retired Klesko to end the inning and Mariano Rivera got the next six outs to send the game to the ninth. Maddux came out of the game one out away from a complete game in the eighth, and Mark Wohlers retired Cecil Fielder to end it. John Wetteland was called on again for his fourth save of the series, but the Braves tried to rally. After he struck out Andruw Jones to lead off the inning, Klesko and Pendleton got back to back singles off of Wetteland. With one out and runners at the corners, Luis Polonia came off the bench to pinch hit for Jeff Blauser, but failed to produce a hit and struck out swinging. Grissom then followed with another single, scoring Klesko and giving the Braves at least one more chance with Lemke at the plate. However, Lemke simply popped out to Charlie Hayes in foul territory to end the game, series, baseball season, and Atlanta's reign as world champions. Wetteland became the second pitcher to record four saves in a single postseason series, following Dennis Eckersley's feat in the 1988 ALCS and since matched by Greg Holland in the 2014 ALCS. He also set a new record for most saves in one postseason, with 7, since tied by 5 other pitchers (Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge, and Koji Uehara, besides Holland). The Yankees had waited 18 years to see another title come to the Big Apple. Aftermath =Braves= The Braves, who were playing in their 4th World Series since 1991, were in the midst of an un- precedented run of success, winning their division every full season from 1991-2005 (not counting 1994 because of the player's strike that canceled that season in August). During that period, the Braves would play in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) nearly every season from 1991-2001 (the lone exception being 2000). But the Braves would make the World Series only one more time in that time, winning their fifth National League pennant in eight seasons in 1999. They were again defeated by the Yankees, who swept the Braves in 4 games. The Braves have not returned to the World Series since, and have made only two appearances in the NLCS (in 2001 and 2020). The Braves' 2 game lead in the 1996 World Series marked the closest the Braves would come to a second World Series title in the Bobby Cox era. =Yankees= It took Yankee manager Joe Torre a record 4,272 games to make it to the World Series in his combined careers as a player and a manager, but he would not have to wait very long to go back. The Yankees would win the American League pennant five more times in the next seven seasons (only falling short of making the World Series in 1997 and 2002), which included the Yankees winning three consecutive World Series championships from 1998 to 2000. This gave the Yankees four championships in five years. The 1996 championship was the 23rd in franchise history (that number now stands at 27) and the first of five that Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, and Andy Pettitte won with the Yankees. On October 11, 2005, A&E; Home Video released the New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001) DVD set, featuring one World Series Game apiece from 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Game 4 from the 1996 World Series is included in the set. On September 23, 2008, The Essential Games of Yankee Stadium DVD set was released, featuring six games that were played in Yankee Stadium, which were determined via fan voting. Game 6 of the 1996 Series is included in this set. Composite box 1996 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) beat Atlanta Braves (N.L.). This World Series is notable for being one of the few six-game series in which the winning team was outscored. It happened previously in 1918, 1959, 1977, and 1992, and later in 2003. Seven-game series winners were outscored in 1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1991, 1997, and 2002; (equaled in 2016 and 2017). Broadcasting *This was the first World Series to be televised by the Fox Broadcasting Company. *Fox's play-by-play man Joe Buck became the second youngest person (at the age of 27) to broadcast a World Series. Vin Scully, who this year called the World Series over CBS Radio Sports, is still the youngest at 25, when he called the 1953 World Series for NBC television. Buck however, became the youngest person to ever broadcast all nine innings of a World Series while being a full-time network employee (surpassing CBS' Sean McDonough, who was 30 years of age when he called the 1992 World Series). In 1953, Vin Scully split play-by-play duties with Mel Allen. Also, the network television policy back then allowed announcers representing the participating World Series teams (in the case of 1953, Vin Scully's Brooklyn Dodgers and Mel Allen's New York Yankees) to call the action. *During Game 6 at Yankee Stadium, a fan behind home plate held up a sign that said \\"John 3:16\\". Tim McCarver made mention of this sign, saying that the fan was a true Yankees fan because he knew Tommy John's career ERA. John's career ERA is actually 3.34, not 3.16. *The Atlanta Braves became the first Major League Baseball team to appear in World Series broadcast on all four major networks (NBC in 1957-58 and 1995, ABC in 1995, CBS in 1991-92 and Fox in 1996; they would appear with NBC again in 1999). The Philadelphia Phillies have since duplicated this feat (NBC in 1950 and 1980, ABC in 1983, CBS in 1993 and Fox in 2008-09.)

The 91st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians. The Braves won in six games to capture their third World Series championship in franchise history (along with 1914 in Boston and 1957 in Milwaukee), making them the first team to win at least one crown in three different cities. This was also Cleveland's first Series appearance in 41 years and marked the resumption of the Fall Classic after the previous year's Series was canceled due to a players' strike. The Series was also remarkable in that five of the six games were won by one run, including the clinching sixth game, a 1–0 combined one-hitter by Tom Glavine and Mark Wohlers. This was the first time since the LCS changed to a best-of-seven format that a winner of a LCS via a sweep has gone on to win the World Series. It has since been repeated in 2019 by the Washington Nationals. This World Series, despite being in an odd-numbered year, opened in the NL home because of the omission of the 1994 World Series. Until 2003, the World Series would begin in the AL home in even-numbered (not odd-numbered) years. Background =Atlanta Braves= After losing the World Series in 1991 to the Minnesota Twins and in 1992 to the Toronto Blue Jays, the Atlanta Braves were making their third attempt in four years (not counting the 1994 strike) to capture Atlanta's first title. The Braves overcame some early inconsistency to win their division by 21 games. In the playoffs, which featured a new first round, the Braves overwhelmed the third-year Colorado Rockies, then swept the Cincinnati Reds in the NLCS (spoiling an all-Ohio World Series in the process; notably, prior to their World Series appearance in 1948, the Indians had spoiled an all-Boston World Series by beating the Red Sox in a one-game playoff). The team relied on clutch hitting and its powerful pitching rotation, which was made up of perennial Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Steve Avery. As the NL champion, they opened this World Series at home because there was no 1994 World Series. =Cleveland Indians= After decades of futility, the city of Cleveland finally had a winner in town. The Indians dominated the American League in 1995, winning 100 of their 144 games (their 100–44 record yielded a very high 0.694 winning percentage, which was, at the time, the highest regular season winning percentage in Major League Baseball since 1954, and is, as of 2015, the 12th highest regular season winning percentage in Major League Baseball history since 1900). Furthermore, in just 144 games, they won the AL Central by 30 games, and they performed the difficult feat of leading their league in both team batting average (0.291) and ERA (3.81). Thanks to their hitting and bullpen, this Indians team became known around the league for their ability to come back from many deficits, often in dramatic fashion; of their 100 regular season victories, 48 were come-back victories, 27 came in their last at-bat, eight came by way of \\"walk off\\" home runs, and 13 were extra-inning victories (they were 13–0 in extra-inning games). After this dominance of the AL in the regular season, the Indians, in the playoffs, swept the Boston Red Sox in the opening round, then held off Ken Griffey, Jr. and the red hot Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, before heading into the Series against the Braves. The 1995 Cleveland Indians featured a very impressive batting line-up; one that hit for high average, good power, and had good speed. In addition to leading the AL in batting average (0.291), the Indians in 1995 also led the American League in runs scored (840; 5.83 runs per game), home runs (207), and stolen bases (132). Led by speedsters Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel, along with Carlos Baerga at the top of the order, the Indians offense was powered in the middle of the order by Albert Belle, Eddie Murray, Manny Ramírez, and Jim Thome; at the bottom of the line-up could be found Paul Sorrento (or Herbert Perry) and Sandy Alomar, Jr. (or Tony Peña). Thus, this Indians line-up had six everyday players who finished the season with a batting average of at least 0.300; and, with Herbert Perry and Tony Peña frequently filling in for Paul Sorrento and Sandy Alomar, Jr., respectively, it was not uncommon for the Tribe to field a line-up with as many as eight players who finished the season with a batting average of at least 0.300. In terms of power, though the '95 season was shortened, nevertheless, the Indians' line-up still featured two players with at least 30 HR, five players with at least 20 HR, and seven with at least 10 HR. While this line-up was filled with star players (four, in fact, were named to the 1995 AL All-Star team, namely, Lofton, Baerga, Belle, and Ramirez), Albert Belle stood out among all of them in 1995. Powered by a very strong second half of the season, Belle, the Indians' clean-up hitter in 1995, finished 1995 with a 0.317 batting average, 126 RBI, and 50 home runs. Further to be noted is the fact that, in hitting 50 HR and 52 doubles in 1995, Belle became the first Major League player to hit at least 50 home runs and at least 50 doubles in the same season (an accomplishment which, again, is even more remarkable considering that he did this in a shortened, 144-game season). The Indians also led the 1995 AL in ERA (3.81). While their starting pitching—led by veterans Dennis Martínez and Orel Hershiser—was respectable, it was their bullpen which gave real strength to their pitching staff. Key members of their bullpen staff included veteran right-hander Eric Plunk (6–2, 2.67 ERA), veteran left-hander Paul Assenmacher (6–2, 2.82), the young right-handed set- up man, Julián Tavárez (10–1, 2.44 ERA), and right-handed closer, José Mesa (3–0, 1.12 ERA, 46 SV). Mesa, in his first year as closer, posted a league- leading 46 saves in 1995, and set a then-Major League record of 38 consecutive saves without a blown save. Two of the members of the 1995 Indians' pitching staff—Dennis Martínez (the team's ace) and José Mesa—were named to the 1995 AL All-Star team. Series build-up Thus it was that this Series presented an entertaining match-up of baseball's two best teams, each with reasons to be confident going into the Series. The Atlanta Braves were veterans to the post- season in the 1990s, having won both the 1991 and 1992 NL pennants (not to mention the 1993 NL Western Division title, having won 104 games in 1993), and they were the best team in the NL in the 1995 regular season (having posted a very solid 90–54 record). The Cleveland Indians, on the other hand, newcomers to the post-season (having not been in the post-season since 1954), in posting their 100–44 regular season mark, were the team which had posted not only the best regular season record in the AL, but had completed one of the best regular seasons in all of Major League Baseball history. Further, though the Braves' line-up was not very threatening in 1995 (their .250 team batting average was the second lowest in the NL), still, the Braves could be confident with their star-studded pitching staff—especially their starting staff—headed by the likes of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Steve Avery. On the other hand, though the Indians could not boast of having as nearly a strong starting rotation as the Braves, nevertheless, they could lay claim to a very solid bullpen and one of the greatest batting line-ups that baseball has ever seen. It might also be noted that, though this was the first time that a team from Cleveland and one from Atlanta faced each other in the World Series, there were years, prior to the Braves being in Atlanta, in which the Braves faced a Cleveland team for baseball's crown. In 1948, the Boston Braves faced the Cleveland Indians (with the Indians winning that Series in 6 games). Even before that, in 1892, the Boston Beaneaters, a forerunner of the Braves, were also National League Champions in 1892, and faced the Cleveland Spiders for the championship.Note that this championship was not called the \\"World Series\\"; the World Series as we know it today—the championship series between the NL champion and AL champion—was first played in 1903 The Beaneaters beat the Spiders that year to win that baseball championship. The 1995 World Series was also noted for large-scale protests by Native American activists in response to the controversy surrounding both clubs' usage of Native American- themed nicknames, logos and mascots. Broadcasting NBC was originally scheduled to televise the entire Series; however, due to the cancellation of the 1994 Series (which had been slated for ABC, who last televised a World Series in 1989), coverage ended up being split between the two networks. Game 5 would be the last Major League Baseball game to be telecast by ABC (had there been a Game 7, ABC would have televised it) for 25 years. The network is scheduled to televise up to four wild card games in the 2020 MLB Postseason. This was the only World Series to be produced under The Baseball Network umbrella (a revenue sharing joint venture between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC). In July 1995, both networks announced that they would be pulling out of what was supposed to be a six-year-long venture. NBC would next cover the 1997 (NBC's first entirely since 1988) and 1999 World Series over the course of a five-year-long contract, in which Fox would cover the World Series in even numbered years (1996, 1998 and 2000). Also during the World Series in 1995, NBC's Hannah Storm not only became the first woman to serve as solo pre- game host of a World Series (CBS' Andrea Joyce co-hosted with Pat O'Brien in 1993) but also became the first woman to preside over a World Series Trophy presentation. Storm was infamously the recipient of a profane outburst from Albert Belle in his team's dugout. Later, Belle was unrepentant: \\"The Indians wanted me to issue a statement of regret when the fine was announced, but I told them to take it out. I apologize for nothing.\\" John Saunders served as pre-game host for ABC's coverage. Serving as field reporters for the series were Lesley Visser (ABC) and Jim Gray (NBC). The six games averaged a national Nielsen rating of 19.5 and a share of 33. Through 2016, this remains the highest-rated World Series of the post-strike era. On the radio side, CBS was the national broadcaster with Vin Scully and Jeff Torborg on the call. Locally, WKNR aired the series in Cleveland with Herb Score and Tom Hamilton announcing, while WSB broadcast the series in Atlanta with Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren, Don Sutton, and Joe Simpson announcing. Summary Matchups =Game 1= Atlanta ace Greg Maddux pitched a two-hit complete game victory in his first World Series appearance (and just the 15th two-hitter in Series history). The Indians scored in the first inning when Kenny Lofton reached on an error, stole second and third, and scored on an RBI groundout by Carlos Baerga. In the bottom of the second, Fred McGriff launched a tape measure home run on his first ever World Series pitch off Cleveland starter Orel Hershiser to even the score at 1–1. Both starters settled down until the seventh, when Hershiser and the Cleveland bullpen walked the first three Braves to open the inning. The Braves would take a 3–1 lead after Luis Polonia hit into a run- scoring force play and Rafael Belliard bunted a perfect suicide squeeze. Lofton scored the Indians another run in the ninth to cut the Braves lead to a single run, (both Cleveland runs resulted from errors and were thus, unearned) but Baerga lifted a pop fly that third baseman Chipper Jones grabbed near the visiting dugout to end the game. =Game 2= Atlanta No. 2 starter Tom Glavine got the win in Game 2, aided by a big sixth-inning home run by catcher Javy López, who also picked Manny Ramirez off first base at a crucial moment in the eighth inning to erase a potential game-tying baserunner. The Indians had taken an early 2–0 lead on an Eddie Murray two-run home run after Albert Belle got on base, but the Braves evened the score in the third with a sac fly by Chipper Jones and an RBI single by David Justice. Lopez launched his home run in the sixth inning from Cleveland starter Dennis Martínez. The Atlanta bullpen held off the Indians in the later innings despite allowing a run in the seventh, and Mark Wohlers earned the save, giving the Braves a 2–0 series lead. =Game 3= With the World Series moving to raucous Jacobs Field in Cleveland, the Indians got their first win. The Indians offense got back on track off Atlanta starter John Smoltz. With the Tribe already down 1–0 in the bottom of the first, Kenny Lofton singled to center and scored on Omar Vizquel's triple into the right field corner. Omar then scored the go-ahead run when Carlos Baerga grounded out. In the third, the Tribe were back at it again when Lofton opened the inning by ripping a double into the right-center field gap. Omar then got a bunt single and Baerga singled to left to drive in Lofton. Albert Belle then rolled a grounder up the middle to score Vizquel to make it 4–1. This was Smoltz's only early exit and only poor start in eight career World Series appearances. The Braves got a boost, however, when reliever Brad Clontz induced a double play groundout by Manny Ramírez to escape further damage. Home runs by Fred McGriff and Ryan Klesko brought the Braves closer at 4–3. Cleveland added a run in the seventh on another RBI hit by Baerga scoring Lofton (who would reach base in all six of his plate appearances). With a 5–3 lead going into the eighth, trouble brewed for Cleveland when Charles Nagy and the bullpen gave up the lead. Marquis Grissom led off with a double off the wall. Polonia singled through the right side to drive in Grissom, sending Nagy to the showers. Chipper Jones walked, McGriff hit a deep fly moving the runners up a base, and David Justice reached when Baerga booted his groundball, subsequently allowing Polonia to score the tying run. The inning was capped off by Mike Devereaux's RBI single giving the Braves a 6–5 lead. The Braves couldn't hold on to their slim lead either as Sandy Alomar, Jr. laced a game-tying double inside the line at first in the bottom of the eighth. The two closers, Mark Wohlers and José Mesa then matched zeros for the next two innings. In the 11th, the Braves went to Alejandro Peña. Baerga immediately smashed a double and after an intentional walk to Belle, veteran Eddie Murray singled to center, scoring pinch runner Álvaro Espinoza and cutting Atlanta's World Series lead in half. A record 18 pitchers were used between the Braves and Indians in Games 2 and 3. =Game 4= Braves manager Bobby Cox controversially decided to start beleaguered left-hander Steve Avery in the critical Game 4 instead of coming back with Greg Maddux. Despite his uncharacteristically poor regular season showing (7-13, 4.67 ERA), Cox felt Avery deserved a chance after having won the NLCS clincher against Cincinnati throwing six shutout innings. Young Braves outfielder Ryan Klesko hit a sixth-inning home run to give Atlanta the lead. Avery was able to again deliver six effective innings, only giving up a sixth-inning home run to Cleveland slugger Albert Belle. A controversial play happened when Eddie Murray hit a pitch over third base, left-field umpire Jim McKean called it foul while third-base umpire Harry Wendelstedt looked at Jim McKean to make the call. Murray eventually walked and reached second on a balk by Avery, but Herbert Perry struck out to end the inning. The Braves promptly broke the tie with a three-run seventh, with David Justice plating two of the runs with a single. An RBI double by Javy López gave the Braves an insurance run, making it 5–1. Reliever Pedro Borbón, Jr. saved the 5–2 win after Mark Wohlers ran into trouble, and the Braves were one victory away from a title. =Game 5= It seemed the perfect situation for Atlanta with Greg Maddux pitching Game 5 with a chance to clinch the title, but Albert Belle slugged a two-run homer in the first inning, and the Braves lineup was held in check by Cleveland veteran Orel Hershiser who went eight innings, only surrendering two runs. Luis Polonia hit a solo home run into the fourth and Atlanta actually tied the game at 2–2 with a run-scoring infield single by Marquis Grissom in the fifth, but Cleveland got two more runs from Maddux making it 4–2. Jim Thome hit an insurance home run in the eighth, which proved necessary as Ryan Klesko homered in his third consecutive game, reducing the gap to 5–4. Klesko became the first person ever to homer in three consecutive World Series road games, by belting homers in Games 3, 4, and 5. The win gave Cleveland the hope of perhaps another Braves World Series collapse and sent the Series back to Atlanta. As previously mentioned, this game was the most recent baseball game that ABC televised until the 2020 postseason. =Game 6= Controversy struck on the morning of Game 6 when Atlanta newspapers printed stories that right fielder David Justice had ripped the city's fans for not matching their motivation of past seasons. Justice, who had been struggling in the postseason, was vilified before the game, but when his sixth-inning home run off a 1–1 pitch by Jim Poole broke a scoreless tie, he became a hero. Tom Glavine pitched eight innings of one-hit ball and allowed just three walks (two to Albert Belle, who was caught stealing second in the second inning to keep a runner from advancing into scoring position) to help earn him the Series MVP. Only one Indian advanced into scoring position in the entire game when Kenny Lofton stole second, but no one could get him in. Cleveland starter Dennis Martínez lasted just 4 innings due to allowing four hits and five walks, but no Braves scored. After Justice's home run, the Braves managed just one hit. The lone hit for the Indians was a bloop-single by catcher Tony Peña in the sixth. Closer Mark Wohlers pitched the ninth inning, preserving the 1–0 shutout and Atlanta's coveted title when Carlos Baerga's fly ball landed in center fielder Marquis Grissom's glove. Carlos Baerga was responsible for making the last out in three of the four Cleveland losses; Games 1, 2 and 6. As of 2017, this is the last 1–0 game won by the home team. In 1995, the Cleveland Indians batted .291 as a team, led the league in runs scored, hits, and stolen bases, and had eight .300 hitters in their starting lineup. However, the Tribe was held to a .179 batting average in the World Series. Then-Executive Committee Chairman Bud Selig presided over the Commissioner's Trophy presentation for the first time. In the previous two World Series (1992 and 1993), American League president Dr. Bobby Brown presided over the trophy presentation. Selig would become Commissioner of Baseball in 1998. The Braves' victory marked the only time that the city of Atlanta won a world championship in any of the four major professional sports. The NFL's Atlanta Falcons came close twice, but lost to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII during the 1998 season and again to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI during the 2016 season. (Coincidentally, the NBA's Hawks won the championship in 1958 when the franchise was based in St. Louis, months after the Milwaukee Braves won the 1957 World Series.) Game 6 is also the Braves' most recent home victory in the Fall Classic - the Braves would lose to the New York Yankees in all three Series games played in Atlanta the following year, be swept by the Yankees in 1999 and have not appeared in a World Series since. As for Cleveland, the Indians would return to the World Series in , where they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games; they would also lose to the Chicago Cubs in , and once again, in seven games. The NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers have been to five NBA Finals, losing to the San Antonio Spurs in a four-game sweep in 2007 and to the Golden State Warriors in a six-game 2015 Finals, and then defeating the same Warriors in the rematch (however, in 2017 the Warriors defeated the Cavaliers again in their third consecutive Finals matchup, which lasted five games, and then swept them in the 2018 finals). The NFL's Cleveland Browns, who within a few months after this World Series would make a controversial move to Baltimore (where they currently play as the Ravens, winners of Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII) and be revived in 1999, are one of four franchises to have never been to a Super Bowl. A Cleveland team would not win a major professional sports championship until the Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors in the full seven games in the 2016 NBA Finals.

They are ground-nesting birds that breed in the mountain ranges of southern Eurasia from the Caucasus to the Himalayas and western China. Some of the species have been introduced into the United States. Snowcocks feed mainly on plant material. Characteristics Snowcocks are bulky, long-necked, long-bodied partridge-like birds. Males and females are generally similar in appearance but females tend to be slightly smaller and rather duller in colouration than males. They are generally grey with varying amounts of white, black and brown according to species and with distinctive white under tail-coverts. Their plumage is thick with a downy base to the feathers which helps them to withstand severe winter temperatures that may fall to . The colour of juvenile snowcocks is similar to the colour of the females and the young are not fully grown until their second year of life. Snowcocks are heavy birds and are unable to fly far with flapping flight. Instead they run to a high point, launch themselves into the air and glide, gradually losing altitude. They are to be found on open slopes above the tree line where they feed on leaves, shoots, roots, fruits, berries and insects. Distribution The snowcocks are each endemic to different mountain ranges in Asia where they are normally found on open slopes above the tree line. Only in the case of the Himalayan snowcock and the Tibetan snowcock do their ranges overlap. The Caucasian snowcock occurs in the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Russian Federation. It has been introduced into the United States. The Caspian snowcock is native to eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and Georgia and has been introduced into the United States. The Tibetan snowcock is native to mountain ranges in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Tajikistan and China. The Himalayan snowcock occurs in mountainous areas of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Nepal, India and China and has been introduced into the United States. The Altai snowcock is endemic to high altitudes in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China and the Russian Federation. Species The five species within the genus along with subspecies are: *Caucasian snowcock, Tetraogallus caucasicus (Pallas, 1811) Tetraogallus caucasicus *Caspian snowcock, Tetraogallus caspius (Gmelin, 1784)Tetraogallus caspius ** T. c. caspius (Gmelin, 1784) ** T. c. semenowtianschanskii Zarudny, 1908 *Tibetan snowcock, Tetraogallus tibetanus Gould, 1854Tetraogallus tibetanus ** T. t. tibetanus Gould, 1854 ** T. t. tschimenensis Sushkin, 1926 ** T. t. centralis Sushkin, 1926 ** T. t. przewalskii Bianchi, 1907 ** T. t. henrici Oustalet, 1891 ** T. t. aquilonifer R. & A.

In the 1850s and 1860s, he was engineer for the world's first underground railway, London's Metropolitan Railway, built by the \\"cut-and-cover\\" method under city streets. In the 1880s, he was chief engineer for the Forth Bridge, which opened in 1890. Fowler's was a long and eminent career, spanning most of the 19th century's railway expansion, and he was engineer, adviser or consultant to many British and foreign railway companies and governments. He was the youngest president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, between 1865 and 1867, and his major works represent a lasting legacy of Victorian engineering. Early life Fowler was born in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land surveyor John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton Leather, engineer of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather's uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway surveys. From 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George Leather as resident engineer on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway when it opened in 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a consulting engineer in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Broadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons. Railways Construction of the Metropolitan Railway close to King's Cross station in 1861 Fowler established a busy practice, working on many railway schemes across the country. He became chief engineer for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and was engineer of the East Lincolnshire Railway, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway and the Severn Valley Railway. In 1853, he became chief engineer of the Metropolitan Railway in London, the world's first underground railway. Constructed in shallow \\"cut-and-cover\\" trenches beneath roads, the line opened between Paddington and Farringdon in 1863. Fowler was also engineer for the associated District Railway and the Hammersmith and City Railway. Today these railways form the majority of the London Underground's Circle line. For his work on the Metropolitan Railway Fowler was paid the great sum of £152,000 (£ today), with £157,000 (£ today), from the District Railway. Although some of this would have been passed on to staff and contractors, Sir Edward Watkin, chairman of the Metropolitan Railway from 1872, complained that \\"No engineer in the world was so highly paid.\\" Other railways that Fowler consulted for were the London Tilbury and Southend Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Highland Railway and the Cheshire Lines Railway. Following the death of Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1859, Fowler was retained by the Great Western Railway. His various appointments involved him in the design of Victoria station in London, Sheffield Victoria station, St Enoch station in Glasgow, Liverpool Central station and Manchester Central station. The latter station's wide train shed roof was the second widest unsupported iron arch in Britain after the roof of St Pancras railway station. Fowler's consulting work extended beyond Britain including railway and engineering projects in Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Egypt, France, Germany, Portugal and the United States. He travelled to Egypt for the first time in 1869 and worked on a number of, mostly unrealised, schemes for the Khedive, including a railway to Khartoum in Sudan which was planned in 1875 but not completed until after his death. In 1870 he provided advice to an Indian Government inquiry on railway gauges where he recommended a narrow gauge of for light railways. He visited Australia in 1886, where he made some remarks on the break of gauge difficulty. Later in his career, he was also a consultant with his partner Benjamin Baker and with James Henry Greathead on two of London's first tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway. Bridges Forth Bridge As part of his railway projects, Fowler designed numerous bridges. In the 1860s, he designed Grosvenor Bridge, the first railway bridge over the River Thames, and the 13-arch Dollis Brook Viaduct for the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway. He is credited with the design of the Victoria Bridge at Upper Arley, Worcestershire, constructed between 1859 and 1861, and the near identical Albert Edward Bridge at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire built from 1863 to 1864. Both remain in use today carrying railway lines across the River Severn. Following the collapse of Sir Thomas Bouch's Tay Bridge in 1879, Fowler, William Henry Barlow and Thomas Elliot Harrison were appointed in 1881 to a commission to review Bouch's design for the Forth Bridge. The commission recommended a steel cantilever bridge designed by Fowler and Benjamin Baker, which was constructed between 1883 and 1890. Locomotives Fowler's fireless locomotive at Edgware Road, October 1862 To avoid problems with smoke and steam overwhelming staff and passengers on the covered sections of the Metropolitan Railway, Fowler proposed a fireless locomotive. The locomotive was built by Robert Stephenson and Company and was a broad gauge 2-4-0 tender engine. The boiler had a normal firebox connected to a large combustion chamber containing fire bricks which were to act as a heat reservoir. The combustion chamber was linked to the smokebox through a set of very short firetubes. Exhaust steam was re-condensed instead of escaping and fed back to the boiler. The locomotive was intended to operate conventionally in the open, but in tunnels dampers would be closed and steam would be generated using the stored heat from the fire bricks. Fowler's A class locomotive The first trial on the Great Western Railway in October 1861 was a failure. The condensing system leaked, causing the boiler to run dry and pressure to drop, risking a boiler explosion. A second trial on the Metropolitan Railway in 1862 was also a failure, and the fireless engine was abandoned, becoming known as \\"Fowler's Ghost\\". The locomotive was sold to Isaac Watt Boulton in 1865; he intended to convert it into a standard engine but it was eventually scrapped. On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were provided by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the engines in use and they remained in operation until electrification of the lines in the 1900s. Other activities and professional recognition Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Fowler stood unsuccessfully for parliament as a Conservative candidate in 1880 and 1885. His standing within the engineering profession was very high, to the extent that he was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for the period 1866-67, its youngest president. Through his position in the Institution and through his own practice, he led the development of training for engineers. In 1865/67, he purchased the adjacent estates of Braemore and Inverbroom, near Ullapool in Ross-shire, Scotland, comprising 44,000 acres and becoming one of the premier Deer Forests (sporting estates) of the HighlandsArthur Grimble – The Deer Forests of Scotland, London 1896. He built the substantial Braemore House (since demolished), where he entertained at the highest levels of politics and society. He developed a hydro-electric scheme, fed from the artificial Home Loch, planted extensive woodlands on the steep valley sides, and created 12 km of recreational walks through them, including suspension footbridges over the Corrieshalloch and Strone Gorges (the former now an NTS property)Canmore - Historic Scotland online, research reported by Prof Roland Paxton, https://canmore.org.uk/search/image?SIMPLE_KEYWORD=Braemore. He also developed a network of stalkerpaths. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant of the County. Lady Fowler here became a noted botanistGrimble, op. cit.. He listed his recreations in Who's Who as yachting and deerstalking and was a member of the Carlton Club, St Stephen's Club, the Conservative Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron. He was also President of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. In 1885 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George as thanks from the government for allowing the use of maps of the Upper Nile valley he had had made when working on the Khedive's projects. They were the most accurate survey of the area and were used in the British Relief of Khartoum. In 1887 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Following the successful completion of the Forth Bridge in 1890, Fowler was created a baronet, taking the name of his Scottish estate as his territorial designation. Along with Benjamin Baker, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Edinburgh in 1890 for his engineering of the bridge. In 1892, the Poncelet Prize was doubled and awarded jointly to Baker and Fowler. Fowler died in Bournemouth, Dorset, at the age of 81 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Sir John Arthur Fowler, 2nd Baronet (died 25 March 1899). The baronetcy became extinct in 1933 on the death of Reverend Sir Montague Fowler, 4th Baronet, the first baronet's third son.

The 87th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the defending champions and heavily favored American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds. The Reds defeated the Athletics in a four-game sweep. It was the fifth four-game sweep by the NL and second by the Reds after they did it in 1976. It was the second consecutive World Series to end in a sweep, after the Athletics themselves did it to the San Francisco Giants in . It is remembered for Billy Hatcher's seven consecutive hits. The sweep extended the Reds' World Series winning streak to nine games, dating back to . This also was the second World Series meeting between the two clubs (Oakland won four games to three in 1972). As of 2020, this remains both teams' most recent appearance in the World Series. Athletics manager Tony La Russa and Reds manager Lou Piniella were old friends and teammates from their Tampa American Legion Post 248 team.  Background  = Cincinnati Reds = The Cincinnati Reds won the National League West division by five games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. They set an NL record by staying in first place in the division for the entire season or \\"wire-to-wire\\", which had been done only one other time, by the 1984 Detroit Tigers. The Reds then defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, four games to two, in the National League Championship Series.  \\"The Nasty Boys\\"  The strength of the Cincinnati Reds bullpen and timely hitting led them to a quick sweep of the AL champions. The Reds' bullpen had three primary members—Norm Charlton, Randy Myers, and Rob Dibble—collectively they were known as the \\"Nasty Boys\\", who wouldn't let the A's score against them in nearly nine innings of work. Media talk of a forthcoming A's dynasty led Reds fans to call their own team the \\"dyNASTY.\\" The Nasty Boys originally referred to five pitchers, with the other two being Tim Layana and Tim Birtsas (though history relates it to the aforementioned three). On his XM show, Dibble still adds these two pitchers into the \\"Nasty Boys\\", stating it was a collective bullpen effort. = Oakland Athletics = The Oakland Athletics won the American League West division by nine games over the Chicago White Sox. They then defeated the Boston Red Sox, four games to none, in the American League Championship Series. The Athletics were the defending World Series champions, two-time defending American League champions, and heavy favorites against the Reds. The Athletics became the first franchise to appear in three consecutive World Series since the 1976–1978 New York Yankees. Their lineup included three former AL Rookies-of-the-Year: José Canseco (1986), Mark McGwire (1987), and Walt Weiss (1988). A's outfielder Willie McGee won a batting title that year, but it wasn't the AL batting title. He batted .335 for the NL's St Louis Cardinals (with enough plate appearances to qualify for the NL batting title) before he was traded in late August to Oakland. Behind starter Dave Stewart and reliever Dennis Eckersley, the Athletics had won 306 games over the prior three seasons.  Summary   Matchups  = Game 1 = The schedule called for the seven-game series to be held Tue–Wed, Fri–Sat–Sun, Tue–Wed. Games 5, 6, and 7, however, were not necessary. This was the first World Series to begin play on a Tuesday since , and the last until (all World Series between and , with the exception of this one, were scheduled to begin on a Saturday, while those from through featured Wednesday starts). The change in this instance was necessitated by an early season lockout which had caused the first week of the season to be postponed. In order to make up the postponed games, the regular season was extended by three days, causing the postseason to begin on a Thursday rather than a Tuesday, as had been the practice for many years. When Oakland Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart entered to pitch Game 1, he had a six-game postseason winning streak going, which ended after four innings of work. The Reds got out of the gate quickly with a two-run home run (that nearly hit the CBS television studio where anchor Pat O'Brien was sitting in left-center) from Eric Davis in the bottom of the first inning off A's ace Dave Stewart. Billy Hatcher helped out offensively in a big way by starting his streak of seven straight hits in the series after a walk in the first inning. The Reds added to their lead when Barry Larkin drew a leadoff walk in the third and scored on a double by Hatcher, who moved to third on shortstop Mike Gallego's throw to home, then scored on Paul O'Neill's groundout. In the fifth, after a one-out double by Hatcher and an O'Neill walk off of Todd Burns, Davis's RBI single made it 5–0 Reds and after a groundout moved the runners up, Chris Sabo's two-run single capped the game's scoring at 7–0. José Rijo settled in after the early lead with seven shutout innings. Two \\"Nasty Boys,\\" Rob Dibble and Randy Myers pitched the eighth and ninth innings and Cincinnati cruised to a surprise victory. The following day's headline in The Cincinnati Post captured the city's surprise with the headline, \\"Davis Stuns Goliath.\\" = Game 2 = First Lady Barbara Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOSQ3wtqd-E Eventual Cy Young Award winner Bob Welch opposed postseason veteran Danny Jackson in Game 2. Rickey Henderson manufactured a run for the A's in the first by getting a hit, stealing second, getting sacrificed to third by Carney Lansford, and scoring on a groundout by José Canseco. The Reds came right back in the bottom of the first. Barry Larkin and Billy Hatcher hit consecutive opposite field doubles and Hatcher would score on Davis's groundout. In the third the A's got the lead back. José Canseco hit a rocket into the right-center field stands to tie the game (his only hit of the series). A base hit by Mark McGwire and two walks to Dave Henderson and Willie Randolph followed, knocking the ineffective Jackson out of the game. With the bases loaded, Ron Hassey hit a sac fly off new pitcher Scott Scudder to score McGwire and Mike Gallego singled to center off Scudder to score Dave Henderson to give the A's a 4–2 lead. The A's, however, would not score any more runs thanks to the relief pitching of Scudder, All-Star game starter Jack Armstrong, and the threesome nicknamed the \\"Nasty Boys\\": Rob Dibble, Norm Charlton, and Randy Myers. The Reds got a run closer at 4–3 on pinch hitter Ron Oester's RBI single that drove in Joe Oliver in the fourth; incidentally, this would be the last plate appearance of Oester's career, all 13 seasons of which were spent in Cincinnati. The Reds tied it in the eighth when Hatcher tripled over the crippled Canseco (who was suffering from back spasms throughout the playoffs) and scored on pinch-hitter Glenn Braggs's force play (after O'Neill was walked to set it up). Welch would be charged with all four runs in innings and Rick Honeycutt was charged with a blown save after allowing Hatcher to score. During Game 2, Reds pitcher Tom Browning's pregnant wife Debbie went into labor during the game. Debbie left her seat in the fifth inning to drive herself to the hospital. As the game went on, the Reds wanted Browning ready to pitch just in case the game went well into extra innings. Thinking that Browning was en route to a nearby hospital, the Reds had their radio broadcaster Marty Brennaman put out an All Points Bulletin on Browning, a bulletin that was picked up by Tim McCarver on CBS television, who passed it along in the tenth inning. In the tenth, the Reds broke through to win the game off A's closer Dennis Eckersley. Utilityman Billy Bates chopped an infield single off home plate to start the inning. Chris Sabo singled to left to put runners on first and second. Then Oliver hit a bouncer that hopped over third base and down the line in left to drive in Bates with a walk-off hit. This was the last of five World Series to be played at Riverfront Stadium (, , , , and 1990), which was closed and demolished in 2002. , Great American Ball Park, the Reds current home field, has yet to host a World Series. = Game 3 = In Game 3 the Reds took a 3–0 series lead on the defending champs. Tom Browning started for the Reds while Mike Moore, who had two wins in the 1989 World Series (alongside Dave Stewart), got the assignment for Oakland despite struggling throughout the regular season. In the second inning, Chris Sabo put the Reds up 1–0 with a solo homer. The lead was short lived as DH Harold Baines hit a soaring two-run homer after a Dave Henderson double to give the A's a 2–1 lead in the bottom of the second. In the third, the Reds' seven-run inning began with Billy Hatcher's eighth hit in nine at-bats (he had rapped into a double-play in the first inning ending his streak of seven straight hits). Paul O'Neill then singled off the glove of first baseman Mark McGwire to put runners on first and second. Eric Davis drilled a sharp single to center scoring Hatcher to tie the game and advancing O'Neill to third. Following an RBI groundout by Hal Morris that put the Reds ahead, the Reds went up 5–2 when Sabo hit his second homer of the game into the left field stands. Todd Benzinger, the Reds' DH (the game was in an American League Stadium) then singled and Joe Oliver hit an RBI double. Mariano Duncan drove Oliver home with a single, stole second, and scored himself when Barry Larkin hit a gapper. The A's now trailed the Reds 8–2. Rickey Henderson's third inning home run made it 8–3, but Tom Browning pitched effectively for six innings to earn the victory. Dibble and Myers provided three scoreless innings in relief to put the Reds one win away from the title. = Game 4 = The first pitch was thrown out by former Oakland A Joe Rudi.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOSQ3wtqd-E who was a member of the 3 straight championshipships won in 1972, 1973 and 1974. Game 4 was a pitchers' duel between Dave Stewart and José Rijo (the Game 1 starters) that eventually culminated in the Reds sweeping the series. Despite a 3–0 series lead, the Reds' advantage became tenuous early on when two cornerstones of their lineup --Davis and Hatcher--had to be removed from the game with injuries. Hatcher was hit on the hand by a pitch in the first inning. He was taken to the hospital for X-rays but was found to have only a severe bruise and would likely have been day-to-day had the series continued. Davis's injury was more serious and would have been series-ending. Chasing a fly ball, he fell hard on his elbow jammed into his side and sustained both a rib cage injury and a kidney lasceration. He was also taken to the hospital and, unlike Hatcher, never returned to the park that night. The A's got on the board in the first, when Willie McGee doubled and Carney Lansford singled him in. The game remained 1–0 until the eighth, when the Reds finally got to Stewart. Barry Larkin singled up the middle, Herm Winningham followed with a bunt that he beat out for a base hit, and Paul O'Neill reached on a throwing error by Stewart to load the bases. Glenn Braggs' groundout and Hal Morris's sacrifice fly gave the Reds a 2–1 edge, which was preserved by both Rijo, who at one point retired 20 straight batters, and Randy Myers who got the final two outs. The A's became the first team ever to be swept in a World Series after sweeping the League Championship Series. This was later duplicated by the 2007 Colorado Rockies and the 2012 Detroit Tigers. Additionally, this was the first time since - (when the New York Yankees won both times; the Yankees also did it in and ) that two consecutive World Series ended in a four-game sweep, which would be repeated in - (both won by the Yankees), and again in - (won by the Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox, respectively). The 1990 World Series would be the Reds' fifth championship but would also be remembered as one of the biggest upsets in baseball history. The twelve game differential between the teams' regular season records made this one of only two times in World Series history that a team swept an opponent whose regular season record bested theirs by ten games or more, the other being the 1954 New York Giants, who swept the 14-games-better Cleveland Indians. Currently, this is the last time either team has appeared in the World Series. This is also the most recent sports championship for the city of Cincinnati. Cincinnati Reds' pitcher José Rijo became the second Dominican born player to earn World Series MVP honors. Pedro Guerrero of the Los Angeles Dodgers in , along with his co- MVP teammates Ron Cey and Steve Yeager was the first Dominican born to earn World Series MVP. Fourteen years after Rijo's award, (), Manny Ramírez of the Boston Red Sox became the third. Other Series heroes included Reds third baseman Chris Sabo who went 9 of 16 (.562) with 2 home runs; and Reds outfielder Billy Hatcher, who set a World Series record with seven consecutive hits. In addition, Hatcher's .750 batting average (9 for 12) broke a four- game-Series mark set by Babe Ruth (.625 in ).  Composite box  1990 World Series (4–0): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) over Oakland Athletics (A.L.)  Radio and television coverage  This was the first of four consecutive World Series to be televised on CBS. From 1976 to 1989, World Series telecasts alternated between ABC (in odd numbered years) and NBC (in even numbered years). Also during the 1990 World Series, Lesley Visser became the first female sportscaster to cover a World Series. Serving as field reporters for CBS were Jim Kaat (the Reds' dugout) and the aforementioned Visser (the Athletics' dugout). CBS Radio continued as the radio home of the World Series for a 15th consecutive season. 1990 saw the return of Vin Scully to their radio booth for the first time in eight years; he had left CBS in 1983 after the network chose not to give him their top National Football League assignment alongside John Madden and had spent the previous seven seasons as the lead voice for NBC's baseball telecasts. Johnny Bench, who had joined the radio broadcast in 1989 after Bill White became President of the National League, was the analyst in the booth.

It is endemic to the Caucasus Mountains, particularly the Western Caucasus, where it breeds at altitudes from 2000–4000 m on bare stony mountains. It nests in a bare ground scrape and lays typically 5-6 greenish eggs, which are incubated only by the female. Its food is seeds and vegetable matter. It forms small flocks when not breeding.  Description  This is a long bird. Its plumage is patterned with grey, brown, white and black, but this snowcock looks grey from any distance. The breast is darker and the flanks ruddier than the rest of the body. It has a white throat and a white patch on the side of the neck. The nape is rust-coloured. In flight, this wary bird shows white flight feathers and undertail, and reddish sides to the tail. Male and female plumages are similar, but the juvenile is slightly smaller and duller in appearance. Caucasian snowcock has a desolate whistling song, vaguely like a Eurasian curlew, '.

Starting in 1988, the show ran 50 weekends of the year until 2016. As its subtitle states, the show consists of 30 short plays performed in 60-minutes. All were written, directed, and performed by a small ensemble called the Neo-Futurists. The plays tend to be a mixture of autobiography and performance art, as with much of the Neo-Futurists' work. The Neo-Futurists continued their 50 weekend a year performing streak with a new show titled The Infinite Wrench in 2017. History Neo-Futurism as an aesthetic, as well as the format of TML, are both creations of founder Greg Allen. Although, due to the changing roster of plays in TML, Allen did not actually have a play in the show at all times during its run. In 2003, Allen ceased to be a member of the performing ensemble. The Neo-Futurism aesthetic is a variant of the early 20th century Italian Futurism movement. Greg Allen came up with the name from a young autistic child who would smash light bulbs and say, \\"Too much light makes the baby go blind\\". Later, when he was creating this show, the saying came back to his mind. To date, three volumes of plays from the show have been published. With over 200 'plays.' In November 2016, Allen revoked the Chicago Neo-Futurists' rights to perform TML in a surprise announcement. On February 28th, 2017, the Neo-Futurists in New York and San Francisco in addition to, and in solidarity with, the Chicago Neo-Futurists all launched an ongoing run of a new show titled The Infinite Wrench.. Tone of the show The show is the work of the Neo-Futurism movement, a variant of the Italian Futurism movement and reflects their aesthetic of non-illusory theater, where, as they describe it, \\"all of our plays are 'set' on the stage in front of the audience. All of our 'characters' are ourselves... We do not aim to 'suspend the audience's disbelief' but to create a world where the stage is a continuation of daily life.\\" Structure The ticket price for the show is random, with a fixed number (currently $9 for the Chicago show, $14 for the New York show, and $10 for the San Francisco show) being added to the roll of a six-sided die for each person. Upon payment, a member of the cast shouts, either in noise canceling headphones or with earbuds in, \\"What's your name?\\" at the audience member before giving him or her a name tag with a random and unrelated \\"name\\". Audience members are given a \\"menu\\" of play titles, and plays are selected by audience members shouting their number, with the first number heard being the play performed. Many of the plays contain elements of randomness and audience interaction; plays end when a member of the cast shouts \\"curtain!\\" The list of plays is perpetually rotating. Every week between two and twelve plays (determined by two rolls of a die by someone in the audience) are removed from the \\"menu\\" and replaced with new plays, written in the course of the week. As part of a lighthearted tradition, when a particular evening sells out, the cast orders pizza from a local restaurant, allowing the audience to shout out toppings. Only a single pizza is ordered, however, which the entire audience must share. New York troupe A second Neo-Futurist company was founded in New York City in April 2004. The New York Neo-Futurists perform TML at the Kraine Theater in the East Village. This production has its own ensemble members, and thus contains different short plays from the Chicago show. In 2006, the New York Neo-Futurists were the recipients of the New York Innovative Theatre Awards Outstanding Performance Art Production. San Francisco troupe In 2014, a third Neo-Futurist company was founded in San Francisco by producer Lucy Tafler and New York Neo-Futurist alum Adam Smith, performing in various venues in San Francisco's Theatre District. In 2016, they were voted San Francisco's Best Theater Company in the SF Bay Guardian's \\"Best of the Bay\\" Reader's Poll. Like the New York Neo- Futurists, the troupe has their own ensemble members and plays. As of July 2015, they perform at SAFEhouse for the Performing Arts.

The 86th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Series ran from October 14 through October 28, with the Athletics sweeping the Giants in four games. It was the first World Series sweep since 1976, when the Cincinnati Reds swept the New York Yankees. The four-game sweep by the Athletics at the time would mark only the third time in World Series history that a team never trailed in any game, with the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers, 1966 Baltimore Orioles, and later the 2004 Boston Red Sox being the only other times this occurred, and the first in the playoff era (post-1968). This marked the fourth World Series matchup, and first since 1913, between the two franchises. The previous three matchups occurred when the Giants were in New York and the Athletics resided in Philadelphia. The then New York Giants defeated the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1905 World Series four games to one, the Athletics defeating the Giants in the 1911 World Series four games to two, and then again in the 1913 Fall Classic four games to one. The series would be historic in other ways as well: the 76-year gap between matchups was the longest in World Series history, a record this World Series would hold until 2018 when the Red Sox and Dodgers met for their first World Series meeting in 102 years; it also marked the first time two franchises had faced off in the World Series after having once played each other when both were based in a different city. Fay Vincent, who had just taken over as Commissioner of Baseball after the sudden death of his predecessor Bart Giamatti in September, presided over his first World Series and dedicated it to his predecessor's memory.The black armbands that the Athletics and Giants wore were in memory of the deceased commissioner. In addition, the official World Series balls had Giamatti's signature on them. The Rawlings 1989 World Series Game Baseball. The ball features the World Series logo in Blue, traditional red stitch, and the printed signature of A. Bartlett Giamatti, Commissioner of MLB. This Series was also known as the \\"Bay Bridge Series,\\" \\"BART Series,\\" \\"Battle of the Bay,\\" and \\"Earthquake Series\\" as the two participant cities lie on opposite sides of San Francisco Bay, connected by the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred before the start of Game 3. It was the first cross-town World Series (involving two teams from the same metropolitan area) since 1956, and only the third such series that did not involve New York City (the 1906 and 1944 World Series, which featured matchups between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns respectively, were the others). On October 17, just minutes before the scheduled start of Game 3, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck the Bay Area causing significant damage to both Oakland and San Francisco. Candlestick Park in San Francisco suffered damage to its upper deck as pieces of concrete fell from the baffle at the top of the stadium and the power was knocked out. The game was postponed out of concerns for the safety of everyone in the ballpark as well as the loss of power, with Vincent later saying that he did not know when play would resume. The series resumed on October 27 and finished the next day. At the time, October 28 was the latest end date ever for a World Series, even though the series only lasted the minimum four games. (The 1981 World Series, which went six games, had also ended on October 28. This record was subsequently tied again in 1995, and has since been surpassed several times, first in 2001.) The World Series now regularly concludes at the end of October or beginning of November due to the addition of the Division Series and Wild Card Games to the postseason. Background The San Francisco Giants won the NL West division by three games over the San Diego Padres, then defeated the Chicago Cubs four games to one in the National League Championship Series. The Oakland Athletics won the AL West division by seven games over the Kansas City Royals, then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one in the American League Championship Series. It was the Giants' first World Series appearance since , while the Athletics were playing in their second straight Fall Classic following the Series. Summary † Game 3 was originally slated for October 17 at 5:35 pm; however, it was postponed when an earthquake occurred at 5:04 pm. Matchups =Game 1= Prior to Game 1, a tribute to late Commissioner Bart Giamatti was held; Giamatti's son Marcus threw out the first pitch, and the Whiffenpoofs from Yale University (Giamatti's alma mater) sang the national anthem. Dave Stewart, the Athletics' ace, took on Giants pitcher Scott Garrelts in Game 1 of the Bay Bridge series. Oakland took the lead in the bottom of the second when Dave Henderson walked, advanced to second on a Terry Steinbach single, and scored on another single by Tony Phillips that moved Steinbach up to third. Walt Weiss then sent a soft ground ball toward first, but Giants first baseman (and NLCS MVP) Will Clark threw the ball low and to the right of catcher Terry Kennedy. Steinbach knocked the ball out of Kennedy's mitt, scoring the second run of the inning. Kennedy was charged with an error, and Phillips advanced to second. Rickey Henderson then drove in Phillips on a single to right field; the second inning ended with Oakland leading 3–0. A's designated hitter Dave Parker tattooed a home run to lead off the third off of Garrelts, and Weiss added a lead off home run in the fourth. Oakland starter Stewart dominated the Giants, allowing five hits in a complete game, handing the A's a one-game edge in the Series. \\"We ran into a buzz saw\\", Clark said of Stewart's pitching. =Game 2= Little League World Series MVP and future NHL star Chris Drury threw out the ceremonial first pitch in Game 2. Oakland starter Mike Moore took on Giant Rick Reuschel. Oakland got off to a fast start; Rickey Henderson led off the bottom of the first with a walk. Henderson promptly stole second, and scored one pitch later when Carney Lansford hit a double to right field. The Giants scored their first run of the Series in the top of the third; José Uribe reached first on a fielder's choice, advanced to third via a Brett Butler single, and scored on a Robby Thompson sacrifice fly. The A's regained the lead in the bottom of the 4th when Dave Parker drove a line shot off the wall that was both an inch from being foul and an inch from being a home run. Jose Canseco, who drew a walk earlier that inning, scored on the play. Parker stood at the plate for a moment to watch the flight of the ball, and started to run as soon as the ball hit the wall; Giants right fielder Candy Maldonado appeared to throw Parker out at second, but second base umpire Dutch Rennert called Parker safe. After Dave Henderson walked and Mark McGwire struck out, Terry Steinbach hit a three-run home run off Reuschel to left field, scoring both Parker and Henderson. The Giants had no answer for Oakland's relievers, and the A's won 5–1 and took a 2–0 lead in the Series. =The Loma Prieta earthquake= The Loma Prieta earthquake struck on October 17, 1989, at 5:04 p.m. Game 3 was scheduled to start at 5:35 p.m. at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, and thousands of people were already in the stadium when the quake hit. It was the first major earthquake in the United States to be broadcast by live television. Experts credit the timing of the Series as a lucky break that prevented massive loss of life in the region; key in reducing the loss of life was the fact that many people on both sides of the bay had left work early or were staying late to participate in after-work group viewings and parties, reducing the traffic that would otherwise have been on the collapsed freeways at 5:04 p.m. on a Tuesday (indicating that 42 people had died in the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland). A Goodyear Blimp that was covering the telecast was used to coordinate emergency efforts. At the time the earthquake hit, ABC's crew was in the booth as Tim McCarver was presenting a highlight package. The earthquake hit while the video was playing and temporarily knocked the feed out, and just before it was knocked out Al Michaels could be heard on air saying \\"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth-\\" with the feed cutting out just before he finished. Michaels, McCarver, and third man in the booth Jim Palmer grabbed for whatever they could to brace themselves and grabbed on to one another's legs, leaving all three men with thigh bruises. The audio was restored, with Michaels talking over a screen bumper until the video was restored jokingly saying that the earthquake was the \\"greatest opening in the history of television, bar none!\\"Footage from the game broadcast, originally aired October 17, 1989 By contrast, the broadcasting team in the CBS Radio booth next door, consisting of Jack Buck, Johnny Bench, and John Rooney, was off the air when the earthquake started because their show was in a pretaped segment being played from New York. Bench ran to a spot underneath a steel grate, to which Buck later quipped, \\"If he moved that fast, he'd never hit into a double play. I never saw anyone move that fast in my life.\\" The ESPN live coverage of the Series (ESPN and ABC at the time produced separate broadcasts) was interrupted during then-television analyst Joe Torre's pre-game report on the field. Their equipment van was the only one with a generator, and they continued their live coverage with Chris Berman and Bob Ley.San Jose In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, ABC aired a rerun of Roseanne (and later, The Wonder Years) before Ted Koppel began anchoring news coverage from Washington, with Michaels acting as a de facto reporter. The Goodyear Blimp (which was already aloft for the game) provided video of structural damage and fires within the city. The ABC opening for this telecast (leading up to Al Michaels informing the viewers of the earthquake) was used at the beginning of a 1990 television movie (documenting the Loma Prieta earthquake) called After The Shock.After the Shock (1990) (TV) As for the Series itself, Fay Vincent decided to postpone Game 3 (although he did not tell anyone before doing so, resulting in an umpire protest, though the original reason for the postponement was loss of power in the stadium, concern about possible structural damage, and the danger of possible aftershocks) initially for five days, resulting in the longest delay in World Series history. It was postponed for another five days (until October 27) because of delays in restoring transmission links. Then San Francisco mayor Art Agnos wanted to wait a month before resuming it, with Vincent responding to Agnos by telling him that he might move it elsewhere if the delay would be that long. With that, Vincent quickly had several other National and American League parks put on standby, including Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago, The Kingdome in Seattle, The Astrodome in Houston, or Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City. (Moving the game to the opponents' stadium was not an option, because the Oakland A's were also based in the SF Bay area. Also, it was noted in the news media that there were three major league stadiums in southern California.) Players for the Oakland Athletics returned home, but had to travel via State Route 237 in San Jose, adding an extra 90 minutes due to the collapse of the Bay Bridge and the I-880 Cypress Street Viaduct. Not long after returning, Jose Canseco (still in full uniform) and his wife Esther were spotted filling up their car at a self- service gas station. As noted in his later book Juiced, Canseco noted that someone wrote an article portraying him as chauvinistic forcing his wife to pump the gas, but that in reality, she told him to let her do it because if people saw him in his full uniform, it would cause a scene. The earthquake would affect the National Anthem performances for the games at Candlestick Park as well. Stevie Wonder, who was slated to play the National Anthem on his harmonica at Game 3 on October 17, pulled out days following the earthquake, and in his place Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers, who had been slated to perform at Game 4 on October 18, would sing the National Anthem when Game 3 was finally played on October 27. =Game 3= At the start of Game 3, emergency responders who had aided during the earthquake, including police officers and firefighters, were honored and threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The starters were the Game 1 starters, Stewart and Garrelts. The ten- day delay due to the earthquake allowed both staff aces to start. Dave Henderson just missed hitting three home runs for the A's as his first inning shot bounced off the top of the wall for a double. Giants catcher Bill Bathe became the fifth National League player in World Series history to hit a home run in his very first at-bat. When Game 3 was originally scheduled for October 17, the scheduled starting pitchers were Bob Welch for the A's and Don Robinson for the Giants. Meanwhile, Ken Oberkfell was slated to start at third base for the Giants, with Matt Williams moving over to shortstop instead of the benched José Uribe. Also, Pat Sheridan was slated to take over for Candy Maldonado in right field for the Giants. Maldonado told ESPN that he was in the clubhouse getting ready when the earthquake hit. The first person he saw in the midst of all of this was his teammate, Robinson, who told Maldonado that he sensed that an earthquake was occurring. For Oakland, Ron Hassey was slated to be the starting catcher for Game 3 in place of Terry Steinbach, as Hassey was at the time Welch's personal catcher. This game set a record for most combined HRs hit in a World Series game (7) as well as tying a record for most HRs hit by a single team (5) in a World Series game (the New York Yankees won Game 4 of the 1928 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, which like this series, would end in a sweep). This record for combined HRs in a World Series game would endure until Game 2 in 2017, in which the Astros and Dodgers combined for 8 HRs. =Game 4= At the time, October 28 was the latest end date ever for a World Series, even though the series only lasted the minimum four games. (The 1981 Series, which went six games, had also ended on October 28. This record was tied again in 1995, and has since been surpassed several times, beginning with the terrorism-delayed 2001 Series, which ran from October 27 through November 4. The World Series now regularly concludes at the end of October or beginning of November due to the addition of the Division Series and Wild Card Games to the postseason.) After Nell Carter sang the National Anthem, Willie Mays (who was initially scheduled to throw out the first pitch on October 17 and was about to be interviewed by ABC's Joe Morgan when the earthquake hit) threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The A's led from the first batter of the game on as Rickey Henderson's home run set the tone. Kevin Mitchell's homer would bring the Giants closer as they cut an 8–0 deficit to 8–6 in two innings. But it would prove to be too little too late for San Francisco as they would lose 9–6. This was also Candlestick Park's final World Series game. The Giants' four subsequent National League pennants have come since their move to Oracle Park, in 2002, 2010, 2012 and 2014. Out of respect for the Loma Prieta earthquake victims, the Oakland Athletics chose not to celebrate their World Series victory with champagne, as is normally customary for the winning team in the World Series. =Composite box= 1989 World Series (4–0): Oakland Athletics (A.L.) beat San Francisco Giants (N.L.). Radio and television coverage ABC play-by-play man Al Michaels, who spent three years in San Francisco as an announcer for the San Francisco Giants, was nominated for an Emmy Award for news broadcasting after giving an eyewitness account of the aftermath of the earthquake at Candlestick Park. This would be the last World Series that ABC would televise from start to finish (and also the last they would produce themselves), and Game 4 was the last MLB game on ABC until July 1994. The television rights would move exclusively to CBS the following year (ABC had shared coverage with NBC since 1976 up until the end of the 1989 season). ABC would next televise a World Series in 1995, but only broadcast Games 1, 4, and 5 (the other games were covered by NBC, who had a joint venture with ABC and MLB called The Baseball Network). Due in part to the earthquake and subsequent interruption of play, as well as the four-game sweep by the A's, ABC only drew an overall Nielsen rating of 16.4 for the Series. This was the first World Series since the introduction of prime-time games in 1971 to draw a rating of less than 20. As previously mentioned, CBS Radio also covered the Series. Jack Buck returned for his seventh and last World Series as the radio voice for CBS, as he was to move to the television side the next year. He was joined by Johnny Bench as his analyst, who replaced Bill White when he was appointed to replace Giamatti as president of the National League earlier in the year. Buck was replaced by Vin Scully the next year, who made his return to CBS Radio following NBC Sports' loss of television rights to CBS. Bench covered four more World Series for CBS Radio with the 1993 series being his last. Aftermath The A's would return to the World Series the following season, making it three years in a row. However, they were unsuccessful in defending their championship as the Cincinnati Reds swept them in the 1990 World Series. Oakland has not returned to the World Series since then and has only made two appearances in the American League Championship Series—losing in 1992 to the Toronto Blue Jays and in 2006 to the Detroit Tigers—and a total of 11 times in the postseason (1992, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018 and 2019) since the 1990 Series. At the time of the 1989 World Series, the Oakland franchise had not seen a World Series win since . The Giants, meanwhile, failed to repeat as National League Champions and would not return to the playoffs until 1997, when they were swept by the Florida Marlins in the NLDS. The Giants would not return to the World Series until , when they lost a seven-game series to the Anaheim Angels after holding a 3–2 series lead. It took the Giants until 2010 to get back to the World Series, and they won their first world championship since 1954, when the team was still located in New York, by defeating the Texas Rangers in five games. In , the Giants would go back to the World Series and defeat the Detroit Tigers in a four-game sweep, and in they would beat the Kansas City Royals in seven games to capture their third World Series crown in five seasons. On the A's, players Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco would later play for other teams. McGwire would be traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1997, where he would beat Roger Maris' single-season home run record in 1998 and retire as a Cardinal in 2001. Canseco was traded during the 1992 season to the Texas Rangers and after that bounced around from team to team including a return to Oakland in 1997. He would later win the 2000 World Series with the New York Yankees. Canseco retired in 2001 after a stint with the Chicago White Sox. Manager Tony La Russa remained with the A's until 1995, when he resigned to take the managerial position in St. Louis, where he again got the chance to manage McGwire. La Russa would remain with the Cardinals for the rest of his career, retiring in 2011 after having led the team to three World Series and two world championships. Giants manager Roger Craig (affectionately known as \\"Humm Baby\\") was fired after 1992 season and replaced by Dusty Baker, who managed the team to their next World Series. The final member of the 1989 team, Matt Williams, was traded to the Cleveland Indians after the 1996 season in a trade that brought future Giants star Jeff Kent to the team. Williams would eventually win a World Series as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001, and retired in 2003. Kevin Mitchell would never regain the form that helped him win the National League MVP award in 1989, and after his production declined in the next two seasons he was traded to the Seattle Mariners in the 1991 offseason. Brett Butler would leave after one more season with the Giants, going to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Wins leader Rick Reuschel was gone after the following season, retiring in 1991. Finally, Will Clark was let go by the Giants after 1993 due to a decline in production thanks in large part to injuries that kept him out of the lineup for much of the previous three seasons. Clark signed with the Texas Rangers and despite not being able to escape the injury bug, he was a productive member of the team for the next five seasons. Clark retired following the 2000 season, where he made one last trip to the postseason as a member of La Russa's Cardinals. On June 13, 2009, immediately prior to the second game of the interleague regular season meeting between the Giants and A's, the Giants honored 27 members of their 1989 team. The A's victory continued a string of success for any Bay Area-based professional sports team. The San Francisco 49ers of the NFL continued its '80s dynasty by winning Super Bowl XXIII and XXIV in between the Athletics' World Series triumph. The next championship for the city of Oakland came in 2015, when the Golden State Warriors of the NBA won the 2015 NBA Finals. Later, the Golden State Warriors would win the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers. This would be the first time that the World Series ended in the last week of October, until the 2001 World Series when the 9/11 attacks delayed the NFL and MLB games for a week, and caused the World Series to end in November. The 1981 World Series also finished on October 28. Notes See also *1989 Japan Series References * Neft, David S., and Richard M. Cohen. The World Series. 1st ed. New York: St Martins, 1990.

The entertainment venue first opened in 1980, was forced to close in 2006, then reopened in a new location in 2009. The second location was closed permanently in 2020. History Originally located at 1345 Half Street SE, the circular venue was divided by a wall with a shared bar in the middle and connecting doors. The Ziegfeld's side of the venue featured a large stage adorned on either side by a giant silver high heeled shoe. Each weekend on Friday and Saturday drag queen Ella Fitzgerald (née Donnell RobinsonSean Bugg, \\"The Last Inning,\\" \\"Metro Weekly,\\" April 14, 2005), a staple at the venue, hosted her \\"Ladies of Illusion\\" for two performances a night (one on Sundays.) The shows lasted approximately an hour and featured five drag queens doing a variety of performances for packed crowds. On the Secrets side of the venue there were fully nude male dancers (catering to a mostly gay male crowd). It was one of the few venues in the United States where male strippers are allowed to dance fully nude. In 2006 the property was seized by the District of Columbia via eminent domain and torn down, along with many other gay-oriented businesses, to make way for the new Nationals Park baseball stadium.Hank Stuever, \\"Ballpark Blues,\\" \\"The Washington Post,\\" April 4, 2006 The closing of the bar, compounded with the loss of several nearby LGBTQ businesses, was met with outrage and disappointment. Many were concerned whether a new location could be found.

It mainly protects Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie, the Charleston Light and Liberty Square, Charleston. It was known as Fort Sumter National Monument until it was renamed in the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019. The Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center is located 340 Concord Street, Liberty Square, Charleston, South Carolina, on the banks of the Cooper River. The center features museum exhibits about the disagreements between the North and South that led to the incidents at Fort Sumter, particularly in South Carolina and Charleston. Displays include slavery and the plantation culture, major figures, politics, and how the Confederate Army was formed. This site is also the main departure point for tour boats heading to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, which is only accessible by boat. Park rangers and volunteers offer topical programs throughout the week for every boat. The museum at Fort Sumter itself focuses on the activities at the fort, including its construction and role during the American Civil War. The Fort Moultrie Visitor Center is located at 1214 Middle Street, Sullivan's Island across from the fort itself. There is a self-guiding brochure available and interpretive wayside exhibits posted throughout the fort. Guided tours are offered daily at 11:00 am and 2:30 pm, based on staff availability. The center offers an orientation film and museum exhibits about American seacoast defenses from 1809–1947, and the history of the first two forts. There is an information desk staffed by NPS Rangers, a book/souvenir store and bathrooms. Charleston Light is not open to the public but can be viewed from its surrounding grounds, which also allow beach access.

It is found in the mountains of eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan and throughout the Alborz Mountains of Northern Iran. It breeds at altitudes from on bare stony ground with some alpine scrub. It nests in a bare ground scrape and lays 6–9 greenish eggs, which are incubated only by the female. Its diet consists of seeds and vegetable matter. It forms small flocks when not breeding.  Description  This snowcock ranges from in length, in wingspan and in weight. Its plumage is patterned with grey, brown, white and black, but this snowcock looks pale gray from any distance. The breast is pale gray, the throat and a white patch on the side of the neck are white, and the nape is dark gray. In flight, this wary bird shows white flight feathers and undertail. Male and female plumages are similar, but juveniles are slightly smaller and duller in appearance. There are three races differing in plumage saturation, becoming paler from west to east. The Caspian snowcock has a desolate whistling song, vaguely like a Eurasian curlew, '. It differs from Caucasian snowcock in that it does not have the drop in pitch at the end of the song shown by that species. The calls include loud cackles and bubbled '.

The show ran for 13 episodes on ABC in 1946, for 157 episodes on CBS in 1946–1949, and finally for 51 episodes on NBC in 1949–1951. The series starred Howard Duff (and later, Steve Dunne) as Sam Spade and Lurene Tuttle as his secretary Effie, and took a considerably more tongue-in-cheek approach to the character than the novel or movie. The announcer was Dick Joy. The series was largely overseen by producer/director William Spier. In 1947, scriptwriters Jason James and Bob Tallman received an Edgar Award for Best Radio Drama from the Mystery Writers of America. Before the series, Sam Spade had been played in radio adaptations of The Maltese Falcon by both Edward G. Robinson (in a 1943 Lux Radio Theater production) and by Humphrey Bogart (in a 1941 Academy Award Theater production), both on CBS. Dashiell Hammett's name was removed from the series in the late 1940s because he was being investigated for involvement with the Communist Party. Later, when Howard Duff's name appeared in the Red Channels book, he was not invited to play the role when the series made the switch to NBC in 1950.

The story of the end of the marriage between James Douglas and Barbara Erskine is immortalized in the popular ballad Waly Waly, which is known by many alternative titles (e.g. Jamie Douglas, When Cockleshells Turn Silver Bells, Water Is Wide) with many alternative lyrics and melodies. If the lyrics are to be believed, in 1681 a rumor apparently was put to Douglas by Lowrie of Blackwood that Erskine had been sleeping with another man, and Douglas promptly dropped her. Her father took her home and she never remarried.

The 79th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals and the American League (AL) champion Milwaukee Brewers. The Cardinals won the series, four games to three. The Cardinals had last been in the World Series in 1968; a Milwaukee team, the Braves, had last contended in 1958. The Milwaukee team of 1982 started as an expansion team, the Seattle Pilots, in 1969, which then moved to Milwaukee in 1970 and changed their name to the Brewers.World Series History, Baseball Almanac. The Cardinals made it to the Series by winning the NL East division by three games over the Philadelphia Phillies, and then defeating the Atlanta Braves, three games to none, in the NL Championship Series. The Brewers made it by winning the AL East division by one game over the Baltimore Orioles, and then defeating the California Angels, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series. This is the Brewers' only World Series appearance to date. The Cardinals' victory helped the National League win four straight World Series from to 1982, the longest streak of consecutive titles by the National League in World Series history. The National League would not again win consecutive titles until the 2010 Giants, the 2011 Cardinals and the 2012 Giants. Though the teams had never met before, their home cities had a commercial rivalry in the beer market, as St. Louis is the home of Anheuser–Busch, which owned the Cardinals at the time, while Milwaukee is the home of Miller Brewing and other past major competitors of Anheuser–Busch. This led the media to refer to it as the \\"Suds Series.\\" Preview The 1982 Milwaukee Brewers hit 216 home runs during the regular season, thus earning them the nickname \\"Harvey's Wallbangers\\" (after manager Harvey Kuenn). In sharp contrast, the 1982 St. Louis Cardinals only hit 67 home runs, fewer than the Brewers' Gorman Thomas (with 39 homers) and Ben Oglivie (34 homers) combined. The Cardinals had built their reputation and won their division behind solid pitching, exceptional defense, and aggressive base running, manufacturing runs in a style that would come to be called \\"Whiteyball,\\" named for team manager Whitey Herzog. This style would be the hallmark of the Cardinals through the 1980s and see them into two more World Series (in 1985 and 1987, both of which they lost in seven games). The Brewers and Cardinals each boasted a dominant closer, with veteran Rollie Fingers holding the role for Milwaukee and Bruce Sutter for St. Louis. Fingers did not pitch in this series, which would have been his fourth, due to a muscle tear in his arm. The two teams had made a trade in December 1980 that was expected to benefit both clubs. Milwaukee traded pitchers Dave LaPoint and Lary Sorensen and outfielders Sixto Lezcano and David Green to the Cardinals, with pitcher Pete Vuckovich and catcher Ted Simmons comprising two-thirds of St. Louis' return. The Cardinals built their team on speed, clutch hitting and pitching. The Cardinals made additional trades for Willie McGee, Ozzie Smith, George Hendrick, Joaquín Andújar, and Sutter, all designed to craft a well balanced championship level team. The Brewers combined a productive farm system with additional trades as well to build their heavy hitting ball club. Thomas, Moose Haas, Robin Yount, and Paul Molitor came through the system, while the aforementioned Vukovich, Simmons, Fingers, and Oglivie, plus Cecil Cooper and Don Money, all arrived via the trade route. On June 1, with the team 23–24 and floundering in fifth place, Brewer GM Harry Dalton replaced manager Buck Rodgers with Harvey Kuenn. The Brewers responded by winning at a .626 clip the rest of the way, taking first place for good on July 31 and never looking back. Summary Matchups =Game 1= The Brewers' left- hander Mike Caldwell pitched a complete game shutout, allowing only three hits. The Brewers' offense was led by Paul Molitor, who had a World Series- record five hits and two RBIs. Robin Yount added four hits and two RBIs. The Brewers went up 2–0 in the first when Cardinals' first baseman Keith Hernandez's error on Ben Oglivie ground ball with two on scored a run, then Gorman Thomas's RBI single scored another. Charlie Moore doubled to lead off the fourth and scored on Molitor's single while Ted Simmons homered next inning. Cardinals starter Bob Forsch allowed consecutive two-out singles to Jim Gantner and Molitor in the sixth before both scored on Yount's double and knocked Forsch out of the game. In the ninth, Oglivie walked with one out off of Dave LaPoint, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Don Money's single. Jeff Lahti relieved LaPoint and allowed a single to Moore. Gantner's triple then scored two before Gantner himself scored on Molitor's single to cap the scoring at 10–0. This was their last post-season win on the road until October 13, 2011, also against the St. Louis Cardinals. =Game 2= The Brew Crew drew first blood in the second with an RBI double by Charlie Moore. They followed that in the third when Paul Molitor singled, stole second, went to third on a wild pitch by Cardinals starter John Stuper, and scored on a Robin Yount groundout. Ted Simmons stretched the lead to 3–0 with his second homer in two games. The Cardinals scratched back in their half of the third when rookie Willie McGee singled, stole second, and scored on a Tom Herr double. Ken Oberkfell singled in Herr to cut the Brewer lead to 3–2. The Brewers made it 4–2 in the fifth when Yount doubled and Cecil Cooper singled him in. Darrell Porter tied it in the sixth by doubling in two runs. Then, in the bottom of the eighth, the Brewers felt the effects of not having Rollie Fingers in the bullpen. With one out, Pete Ladd, pressed into service as the closer, walked Lonnie Smith with two on to load the bases and then walked pinch-hitter Steve Braun to force in the go-ahead run. The Cardinals could have made it worse, but McGee lined out to short for out #2, and an apparent base hit by Ozzie Smith struck Braun as he was running to second for the third out. Bruce Sutter pitched the ninth and got credit for the win. Longtime American League umpire Bill Haller called his final game behind home plate in this contest. He also was the last umpire to wear a tie on the field, and the last to work home plate in the World Series wearing the \\"balloon\\" style outside chest protector. =Game 3= Game Three home run and defensive hero, Willie McGee. Joaquín Andújar and Pete Vuckovich, each team's pitching aces, were locked in a scoreless pitching duel until the top half of the fifth, when Willie McGee belted a three-run homer for the Cards. The Redbirds added two more in the seventh off Vuckovich. Lonnie Smith doubled to right-center and tried to stretch it to a triple. Smith scored when Jim Gantner's relay throw to third went wild. McGee followed with a home run later in the inning, his second. McGee also had a couple of defensive gems, running down a deep Paul Molitor drive in the first and robbing Gorman Thomas of a home run in the ninth. In the seventh with one out, Andújar had to leave the game when a line drive from Ted Simmons struck his kneecap. The Brewers loaded the bases in that inning, but ace reliever Bruce Sutter got the final out to squelch the threat. Cecil Cooper accounted for the Brewers' only runs with a two-run homer in the eighth off Sutter, while Ozzie Smith drove in the Cardinals final run with a walk. Sutter qualified for the save in this game (even though the Cards had a 5–0 lead when he entered the game), since he entered with the bases loaded, meaning the potential tying run was on deck. =Game 4= Game 4 of the 1982 World Series pitted Dave LaPoint (9–3) against Moose Haas (11–8). Haas was a veteran of six major league campaigns while LaPoint had just completed his first full season. For six innings, the Cardinals seemed on the verge of taking a commanding 3–1 Series lead. Dave LaPoint held the Brewers to three hits in that time span, while his hitters plated him a 5–1 lead. In the top of the first inning, Ken Oberkfell doubled down the right-field line and George Hendrick hit a high chopper over the middle which handcuffed Yount and bounced into center-field, allowing Oberkfell to score. In the bottom of the first, Oberkfell dropped a bare-handed grounder from Yount. Both teams had trouble at times fielding, and the Brewers errors in Game 3 may have cost them three runs. Two Cardinal runs came in the second on an unusual way. With Willie McGee on first and attempting to steal, Brewers catcher Ted Simmons took a pitch-out but bobbled the ball allowing McGee to steal second. After a walk to Ozzie Smith, Moose Haas' wild pitch moved McGee to third and Smith to second. Tommy Herr hit a deep fly. McGee scored easily and Smith took advantage of center fielder Gorman Thomas slipping and falling on the warning track and never stopped, scoring behind McGee for a two-run sacrifice fly for Herr. Ken Oberkfell followed with a walk, stole second and came home when a Keith Hernandez grounder went through Gantner's legs. The Cardinals scored three times despite only one base hit. In the Brewers half of the fifth, with none out and runners at first and third, Ozzie Smith made one of his famous Wizard of Oz plays. Gantner hit a ground ball through the middle towards center field. Smith, though off-balance, stabbed at the ball while simultaneously stepping on second base, recovered and fired to first to double up Gantner. In the seventh, things fell apart. With one out, Oglivie reached first when first baseman Keith Hernandez's toss to LaPoint was dropped. LaPoint was relieved by Doug Bair after giving up a two-out RBI (unearned) double to Gantner. Before relieved by Jim Kaat, Bair walked Molitor and gave up a bases-loaded, two-run (both unearned) single to Yount. An RBI single by Cecil Cooper and a wild pitch brought in the fourth Cardinals pitcher, Jeff Lahti. Lahti intentionally walked (charged to Kaat) Simmons and gave up another bases-loaded, two-run single to Thomas. Lahti issued another intentional walk to Oglivie then induced a fly out to left field to end this inning. In this inning, six runs (three earned) crossed the plate for the Brewers on five hits and one error. =Game 5= Mike Caldwell pitched his second win of the Series and almost went the distance. The Brewers struck first on Ted Simmons's bases loaded groundout in the first off of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied the game in the third on Keith Hernandez's RBI double. The Brewers took a 2–1 lead in the bottom half on Cecil Cooper's groundout with runners on first and third and added to their lead on Paul Molitor's RBI single in the fifth. George Hendrick's RBI single in the seventh cut the Brewers lead to 3–2, but they got that run back in the bottom of the inning on Robin Yount's home run, then added to their lead in the eighth on back-to-back RBI singles by Charlie Moore and Jim Gantner off of Bruce Sutter. The Cardinals staged a late rally in the ninth as Keith Hernandez doubled in a run and George Hendrick singled him in with two outs. Bob McClure came in and allowed a single to Darrell Porter, putting the tying run on base. McClure, however, struck out Willie McGee, then retired pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to end the game. Robin Yount set a World Series record by recording his second four- hit game, his first came in Game 1. To this day, Yount remains the only player to have multiple 4-hit games in one World Series. This was the tenth and final World Series game at Milwaukee County Stadium (1957, 1958 and 1982) as well as the final playoff game at Milwaukee County Stadium. =Game 6= Busch Stadium's lack of a dome caused two delays that totaled over hours. The Cardinals staved off elimination with a blowout win. In the second, Dane Iorg doubled with two outs off of Don Sutton and scored on an error on Willie McGee's ground ball. Tom Herr's double then made it 2–0 Cardinals. In the fourth, Darrell Porter hit a two-run home run, then Iorg tripled and scored on Herr's groundout. Keith Hernandez's two-run home run in the fifth made it 7–0 and knocked Sutton out of the game. In the sixth, Iorg hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a wild pitch by Doc Medich, and scored on McGee's single. A single and walk loaded the bases with two outs before Hernandez's single scored two, Hendrick's single scored another, and an error on Porter's ground ball scored two more. The Brewers avoided a shutout in the ninth when Jim Gantner, who doubled to leadoff the inning, scored on Glenn Brummer's wild pitch. Dane Iorg had two doubles and a triple as rookie John Stuper went the distance (helped by the rain delays), scattering four hits. =Game 7= Joaquín Andújar and Pete Vuckovich opposed each other once again, both of whom were pitching hurt. Andujar was still not at full mobility after the line drive he had taken off the kneecap in Game 3, while Vuckovic was suffering from severe shoulder pain which would be diagnosed the following spring as a torn rotator cuff. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth when the Cardinals scored first on a Lonnie Smith RBI single. Ben Oglivie tied it for the Brew Crew in the fifth with a homer, and they took a 3–1 lead in the sixth when Jim Gantner scored on an error and Cecil Cooper hit a sacrifice fly. But, in the bottom of the sixth, Vuckovich began to run into trouble. With one out, Ozzie Smith singled and Lonnie Smith doubled him to third. Brewers manager Harvey Kuenn then pulled Vuckovich in favor of Bob McClure, who walked pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to load the bases. Keith Hernandez then tied the game with a two-run single. George Hendrick then gave the Cardinals the lead with an RBI single. The Cardinals punctuated the scoring with two runs in the eighth on RBI singles by Series MVP Darrell Porter and Steve Braun. Andújar pitched seven strong innings. After recording the final out of the 7th on Gantner, the two men nearly came to blows after Gantner did not take kindly to Andujar's gesture of exuberance, and home plate umpire Lee Weyer had to step between them and corral Andujar towards the dugout to prevent a fist fight. Manager Herzog, concerned that his notoriously loose cannon starter would allow himself to get rattled after the incident, then turned to closer Bruce Sutter for a two-inning save--his second save of the series. To date, this is the Brewers' most recent World Series appearance. Composite box 1982 World Series (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Milwaukee Brewers (A.L.) Aftermath Paul Molitor set a World Series record with his fifth hit, in the ninth inning of Game 1. Robin Yount would set another record in the seventh inning of Game 5 by becoming the first player in Series history to have two four-hit games. Cardinals catcher Darrell Porter was given the Series MVP award. Brewers pitcher Mike Caldwell, who won two games, would have been a strong candidate, as well as Molitor. Paul Molitor would eventually win the Series MVP Award 11 years later as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays. As it was, the winning team won the MVP. The only player on the losing team to win the MVP was Bobby Richardson of the New York Yankees. Both participants are currently in the NL Central, due to the transfer of the Brewers from the American League to the National League in 1998. This raises the possibility of the Brewers eventually representing two different leagues in World Series competition. That has happened three times before, taking the 19th Century contests into account: The Brooklyn Dodgers of 1889 and 1890, the Cardinals, who won the 1886 Series when they were in the American Association, and the Houston Astros, who played in both the 2005 World Series against the Chicago White Sox as a National League team, and the 2017 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers and the 2019 World Series against the Washington Nationals as an American League team. This also makes this one of two World Series in the modern era (1903–present) that it is not possible to have a rematch, the other being the Astros and White Sox, due to the Astros moving to the American League in 2013. The Brewers and Cardinals would later meet in the 2011 National League Championship Series, with the Cardinals winning that series four games to two. As in 1982, the Cardinals won the 2011 World Series in seven games, this time against the Texas Rangers. As of 2015, the Cardinals' 11 championships are the most won by any National League team, and second only to the New York Yankees, who have 27. As of the 1982 World Series victory, the Cardinals had 9 championships compared to the Yankees' 22. Broadcasting This was the final World Series telecast for longtime NBC analyst Tony Kubek, and the only one for veteran announcer Dick Enberg. Enberg hosted the pregame shows and alternated play-by-play duties (Enberg called the middle innings) with Joe Garagiola, who was himself working his last Series in that role before moving to the color commentator position alongside Vin Scully (who called the 1982 World Series alongside Sparky Anderson for CBS Radio) the following season. Conversely, this was NBC's first Series telecast to feature Bob Costas (who served as a field reporter and hosted the World Series Trophy presentation following Game 7). Costas and Kubek would subsequently team up as the network's secondary MLB announcing team from 1983 to 1989. This included the June 23, 1984 game between St. Louis and Chicago otherwise known as the Ryne Sandberg game.http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/chi-costas- remembers-sandberg-game-on-its-30year-anniversary-20140623-story.html Tom Seaver provided pregame analysis and also contributed occasional in-game commentary throughout the series, broadcasting from field level rather than in the booth. Locally, the Series was broadcast by the teams' flagship radio stations using their own announcers. In Milwaukee, WISN aired the games with Bob Uecker and Dwayne Mosley announcing, while in St. Louis, KMOX aired the games with Jack Buck and Mike Shannon announcing.

Roe and the 2nd Cavalry built the granite memorial in July 1881 that stands today on the top of Last Stand Hill. They also reinterred soldiers' remains near the new memorial, but left stakes in the ground to mark where they had fallen. In 1890 these stakes were replaced with marble markers. The bill that changed the name of the national monument also called for an \\"Indian Memorial\\" to be built near Last Stand Hill. Markers honoring the Indians who fought at Little Big Horn, including Crazy Horse, have been added to those of the U.S. troops. On Memorial Day, 1999, the first of five red granite markers denoting where warriors fell during the battle were placed on the battlefield for Cheyenne warriors Lame White Man and Noisy Walking. The warriors' red speckled granite memorial markers dot the ravines and hillsides just as do the white marble markers representing where soldiers fell. Since then, markers have been added for the Sans Arc Lakota warrior Long Road and the Minniconjou Lakota Dog's Back Bone. On June 25, 2003, an \\"unknown Lakota warrior marker\\" was placed on Wooden Leg Hill, east of Last Stand Hill to honor a warrior who was killed during the battle, as witnessed and reported by the Northern Cheyenne warrior Wooden Leg.

Early life  Carless was born in 1896 to John Thomas Carless, an iron foundry worker, and his wife Elizabeth, of 31 Tasker Street, Walsall, Staffordshire (now in the West Midlands).Carless, John Henry, Commonwealth War Graves Commission Carless had two sisters, Ada and Dora, who were each employed in the local leather trade. He was good at sport and played in the final of the English Schools Football Shield, at Roker Park. After school, he too joined the leather trade, working for Messrs Price and Co., harness makers, as an errand boy. During World War I, he applied repeatedly to join the army, but was turned down on four occasions, due to a \\"weak heart\\". His subsequent application to join the Royal Navy was accepted, and he enlisted on 1 September 1915. His service number was J43703. VC He died when he was 21 years old, and an Ordinary Seaman in the Royal Navy during World War I. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallant actions on 17 November 1917 aboard HMS Caledon at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, Germany, which led to his death. In mid-November 1917 British ships battled German forces in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight (off Germany's north coast). During the action Seaman Carless took a fatal shrapnel wound to the stomach but kept loading his gun, and encouraged his colleagues to do likewise. Once relieved, he collapsed and died. He was buried at sea the following day. The commander of HMS Caledon, H.S. Harrison- Wallace, subsequently wrote Carless's parents: In June 1918, Carless's parents received his posthumous VC from King George V. = Citation = Memorials the Walsall bust The Walsall public raised money for the erection of a memorial in his home town. A bronze bust was created by Wolverhampton-based Robert Jackson Emerson (1878-1944) mounted on a large plinth of Portland stone, outside Walsall Museum (at ), Lichfield Street. On 20 February 1920 it was unveiled by Admiral Sir Walter Cowan, whose flagship had been HMS Caledon, and the ship's white ensign was presented to Walsall's mayor at the time. Carless is listed on Panel 25 of the Portsmouth Naval Memorial. Three thoroughfares in Walsall commemorate John Carless' bravery - Carless Street, in Caldmore, not far from where he was born, along with Caledon Street and Caledon Place in Pleck. A blue plaque on Carless Street notes the origins of the street's name. In December 2009, a memorial plaque to Carless and two other recipients of the Victoria Cross, James Thompson and Charles George Bonner, was unveiled at Walsall Town Hall. In 2014, a memorial paving stone was placed in the grounds of St Mary's the Mount Catholic Primary School in Walsall, where Carless' was educated. = Museum exhibits = The former Walsall Museum had a display on Carless, including a replica of his VC (the original, bequeathed to the people of Walsall in 1986, is held in store, for security reasons), the ship's name-band from his uniform cap, and an oil portrait, commissioned by the Walsall Services Memorial Club. After that museum's closure, the display was moved to Walsall Leather Museum.

Life Byrne was born at Castlecomer, County Kilkenny in Ireland, in September 1832. Byrne was about 22 years old, and a private in the 68th Regiment of Foot (later The Durham Light Infantry), British Army during the Crimean War. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Battle of Inkerman on 5 November 1854 on the Crimean Peninsula. When his regiment was ordered to retire, Private Byrne went back towards the enemy, and, at the risk of his own life, brought in a wounded soldier, under fire. On 11 May 1855 he bravely engaged in a hand-to-hand contest with one of the enemy on the parapet of the work he was defending, prevented the entrance of the enemy, killed his antagonist, and captured his arms. He later achieved the rank of corporal. He died, aged 46, in Newport, Wales. The medal The only medal on display is his New Zealand campaign medal, held in the Durham Light Infantry Museum. A Victoria Cross medal (missing the suspender bar and ribbon) was found by Tobias Neto in the mud of the River Thames on 17 December 2015, the medal having the date of \\"November 5, 1854\\" engraved on the reverse. Of the 16 VCs awarded for actions during the Battle of Inkerman, two were unaccounted for—those won by John Byrne and John McDermond of the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, the other 14 being in private collections or museums. However, in an article published on the UK Detector Net web forum, the finder is seen to confirm that the medal was established as that awarded to John Byrne. It indicates that Sergeant Byrne accidentally, or in self defence, shot an assailant in 1879, and in a fit of regret and despair, he fled to London, disposed of his Victoria Cross medal in the River Thames, and subsequently returned to Newport.

The 78th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. It marked their third meeting in the Series in five years as well as a record 11th Series meeting overall and last Series meeting to date. The Dodgers won the Series in six games in a mirror image of the two teams' last two Series meetings in and ; it was the Dodgers' first title since , their first victory over the Yankees since , and third World Series win over the Yankees, overall. This is the last World Series that a team won after losing the first two games on the road. This also was the last meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship until the Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers reached the NHL's 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, and also the last meeting between the Dodgers and the Yankees in the World Series to date (the two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, making it the most frequent matchup in World Series history ). Background Due to the players' strike, which ran from June 12 to August 8, the 1981 season was split into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a wild card team if the same club won both halves, although this did not occur in any division) meeting in the best-of-five League Division Series (this division series was a one-off occasion; it was not until 1994 that the Division Series would be implemented on a permanent basis). The four survivors would then move on to the two best-of-five League Championship Series. The expanded playoffs led to Game 1 of the World Series being pushed back to October 20, the latest starting date for a Fall Classic up to that time. In the National League, the Dodgers led the National League West prior to the strike. The Houston Astros, however, won the second-half division title. The Dodgers then defeated the Astros, three games to two, in the National League Division Series before beating the Montreal Expos, three games to two, in the National League Championship Series. The Yankees, who led the American League East in the season's first half, took on the Milwaukee Brewers, winners of the second half division title, in the American League Division Series. New York was victorious three games to two, then went on to sweep the Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship Series. The split-season decision was not a popular one, both among teams and their fans. The arrangement resulted in teams with the best overall record in either their division or league that year, in particular the Cincinnati Reds (the majors' best team with 66-42), being left out of the postseason along with the St. Louis Cardinals which lead the NL East with an overall record of 59-43 and a winning percentage of 0.578. Though the teams with the best record in the American League East and West did win their divisions, the Yankees finished 3rd overall in the AL East while the Kansas City Royals finished 4th overall with a losing 50-53 record. =Los Angeles Dodgers= The Dodgers got to the Series with help from Mexican-born rookie phenom Fernando Valenzuela, who won his first eight games including five by shutout. Valenzuela would pitch eight shutouts in all and win both the National League's Rookie of the Year and Cy Young awards. Joining Valenzuela in the rotation were veterans Burt Hooton (11–6, 2.28) and Jerry Reuss (10–4, 2.30). The core of the position players remained intact with perennial all- star Steve Garvey at first, Davey Lopes at second, Bill Russell at shortstop, and team leader in home runs with 13, Ron Cey at third. Budding star, Pedro Guerrero, would move to the outfield becoming a regular starter for the first time in his career, in place of the aging and often injured Reggie Smith. Manager Tommy Lasorda was looking for his first World Series win in his fifth full season with the Dodgers after losing to the Yankees in and 1978. =New York Yankees= The Yankees, managed by Bob Lemon (in his second stint, having replaced Gene Michael), had a losing second-half (25–26) but won the first- half (34–22) to qualify for the playoffs. Ace starter Ron Guidry won 11 games against while rookie Dave Righetti emerged as an important starter, winning eight games with a 2.05 ERA. Righetti would win the American League's Rookie of the Year award. Reliever Goose Gossage recorded 20 saves with an 0.77 ERA, striking out 48 in 47 innings. Dave Winfield was signed as a free agent in the off-season, joined another all-star, Reggie Jackson, in the outfield. Winfield led the Yankees with 25 doubles and 68 RBIs. Winfield's huge contract (US$21 million over 10 years), was added to an already strong lineup. While the Yankees boasted a well-balanced squad, the Dodgers were not to be denied their first World Series title in 16 years. Summary †: postponed from October 27 due to rain Matchups =Game 1= The Series commenced on October 20, making it the latest start of the Series, breaking the previous record by 3 days (1910 World Series, October 17). Bob Watson smashed a three-run homer off Jerry Reuss in the first to get the Yankees started. Lou Piniella chased Reuss with an RBI single in the third, and Dodger reliever Bobby Castillo walked four batters in the fourth to give New York a 5–0 lead. Ron Guidry held the Dodgers to four hits and a run (on a Steve Yeager homer) through seven innings. Ron Davis gave up two in the eighth by walking Derrel Thomas and Davey Lopes to lead off. After the walks, Davis was relieved by closer Goose Gossage who gave up a pinch-hit RBI single to Jay Johnstone and a sacrifice fly by Dusty Baker to score Thomas and Lopes, but Gossage closed out the win in the ninth. Yankee third baseman Graig Nettles suffered a hairline fracture of his left thumb when he made a diving stop. The injury caused him to miss Games 3, 4, and 5, but he played in Games 2 & 6. =Game 2= Former teammates Burt Hooton and Tommy John were locked in a scoreless duel until the fifth, when Larry Milbourne doubled in Willie Randolph for the only run John would really need. The Yankees pushed across two more in the eighth off Steve Howe on a RBI single by Bob Watson and a sacrifice fly by Randolph. John pitched seven shutout innings, and Goose Gossage closed for his second save in two games. =Game 3= Prior to this game, Yankee manager Bob Lemon sat Reggie Jackson. Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game 2 of the ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, but was medically cleared to play Game 3. Jackson was not even allowed to pinch-hit. Lemon said he was resting Jackson as a precaution and because the Dodgers were starting a left hand pitcher. NL Rookie of the Year, pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, lasted the entire game despite allowing nine hits and walking seven and constantly pitching out of trouble. He walked two Yankee batters in the first, but pitched out of it. Ron Cey, meanwhile, provided him a 3–0 lead in the Dodger half with a three-run homer off Dave Righetti. The Yankees cut it to 3–2 in the second on a Bob Watson homer and a Larry Milbourne RBI single. Valenzuela stranded two runners in this inning. Rick Cerone gave the Yanks a 4–3 lead in the third with a two-run homer, but the Yankees left two on once again. Watson led off the fifth with a double, but no one scored as Valenzuela pitched out of it again. In both the third and fifth innings, the Dodgers were helped by the Yankees' being unable to use a designated hitter (since it was used in last season's Series). In both innings, Valenzuela issued two-out intentional walks to number 8 hitter Larry Milbourne in order to pitch to Dave Righetti and George Frazier. Valenzuela struck out the pitchers both times. The Dodgers gave Valenzuela the lead back in the bottom of the fifth off Frazier when Pedro Guerrero doubled in Steve Garvey to tie it, and Cey scored on a double play grounder by Mike Scioscia. With a lead and the Dodger Stadium crowd behind him, Valenzuela appeared to finally settle down. After pinch hitting, Valenzuela's regular catcher Mike Scioscia took over behind the plate. This seemed to have a calming effect on the rookie, as Scioscia knew Spanish and was better able to talk with Valenzuela than Steve Yeager.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124928/index.htm The Yankees mounted their final threat in the eighth when Aurelio Rodríguez and Milbourne led off with back-to-back singles. Pinch-hitter Bobby Murcer attempted a sacrifice bunt, but popped it foul. Cey dove and caught it, then doubled Milbourne off first. =Game 4= After being held out of game 3, Reggie Jackson was back in the starting lineup for this game. The Yankees batters had early success against Dodgers pitcher Bob Welch, who faced four batters without recording an out before being relieved by Dave Goltz. Willie Randolph led the game off with a triple and scored on a Larry Milbourne double. Dave Winfield walked and Jackson singled before Goltz gave up a sacrifice fly to Bob Watson. Randolph smashed a two-out solo home run in the second and Rick Cerone batted in a run with a single in the third for a 4–0 Yankee lead. Yankee starter Rick Reuschel then had problems of his own. He allowed an RBI single to Davey Lopes and an RBI groundout to Ron Cey in the third before leaving in favor of Rudy May. May gave up a double to Steve Garvey and an RBI single to Cey in the fifth, but the Yankees countered with two in the sixth on RBI singles by Oscar Gamble and Watson off Tom Niedenfuer. With a 6–3 lead, the Yankees turned the pitching over to their relief combination of Ron Davis and Goose Gossage. Davis had troubles in the sixth. He issued a one-out walk to Mike Scioscia and gave up a pinch-hit homer to Jay Johnstone to make the score 6–5. Then, Lopes lifted a fly ball to right that Jackson lost in the sun and dropped for an error. Lopes reached second and stole third with no throw by catcher Cerone three pitches later. Davis then gave up a game-tying single to Bill Russell. In the seventh, Dusty Baker led off with an infield hit off George Frazier and went to third on a Rick Monday liner that got past center fielder Bobby Brown when he tried to make a shoestring catch. Monday reached second. Pedro Guerrero was then walked intentionally. Yankee manager Bob Lemon then brought starting pitcher Tommy John out of the bullpen instead of Gossage. Steve Yeager, hitting for Scioscia, promptly gave the Dodgers the lead when he drove home Baker with a sacrifice fly. Lopes followed with an infield single that drove Monday home for an 8–6 lead. John managed to strand Guerrero in scoring position to end the seventh and pitched the last two innings, but closer Gossage never got in the game. Jackson brought the Yankees closer with a home run in the eighth off lefty Steve Howe, capping a 3-for-3 day. But Howe was able to close out the win, despite Willie Randolph pinning Dodger centerfielder Derrell Thomas against the centerfield wall with a deep fly ball. The series was now tied 2–2. According to Johnstone's book Temporary Insanity (1985), Steinbrenner confronted Davis in the Yankees' locker room after the game and demanded, \\"Why did you throw Johnstone a fastball?\\" =Game 5= Needing a win to stop the Dodgers' momentum in this series, the Yankees trotted out their ace, Ron Guidry. Guidry was sharp through six innings, holding the Dodgers to two singles. Reggie Jackson, continuing his torrid hitting, helped provide Guidry a lead by doubling to left in the second off Jerry Reuss, moving to third on a Davey Lopes error, and scoring on a Lou Piniella infield single. The game then took a turn in the seventh inning. After fanning Dusty Baker, Guidry surrendered back-to-back solo home runs to Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager. After he had struck out, Baker suggested to Yeager and Guerrero that they move up in the batter's box to take away Guidry's late breaking slider. Both home runs were hit on sliders almost to the same place in left-center. Meanwhile, Reuss was as effective as Guidry, holding the Yanks to five hits and the lone run and going the distance. A tense moment occurred in the eighth when Goose Gossage beaned Ron Cey. Cey had to be helped off the field with a concussion, but was cleared to play Game 6 after it was delayed one day by rain. =Game 6= This was the latest-ending World Series by calendar date up to that time (surpassing the 1911 Series, which ended on October 26). Originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 27, Game 6 was delayed a day by rain. This allowed Bob Lemon to start Tommy John opposite Dodger starter Burt Hooton. This also allowed Ron Cey to be in the Dodger lineup. Willie Randolph provided John an early lead with a solo homer in the third. The Dodgers tied it in the fourth on an RBI single by Game 5 hero Steve Yeager. In the bottom of the fourth, Yankee manager Bob Lemon made a controversial decision. Graig Nettles led off the inning with a double. After Hooton retired the next two batters, he intentionally walked Larry Milbourne to face John (there was no designated hitter in this series). Lemon pinch-hit for his starting pitcher in the fourth inning of a 1–1 game. Pinch-hitter Bobby Murcer flied out to end the inning. In his 1991 autobiography T.J.: My 26 Years in Baseball, John revealed that before the game, Lemon and team owner George Steinbrenner settled on the following strategy: get the lead early and then protect it with the bullpen (despite the bullpen's collapses earlier in the series). As ABC cameras showed during the broadcast, John paced the Yankee dugout in disbelief after being pulled.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOFzA3M1w0A In the fifth, George Frazier, who relieved John, gave up an RBI single to Ron Cey and a two-run triple to Pedro Guerrero. Frazier would take the loss and become the first pitcher to lose three games in a best-of-seven World Series and second pitcher to lose three times in any World Series (the first being Lefty Williams, a member of the Chicago White Sox in the best-of-nine 1919 World Series). New York's bullpen further collapsed in the sixth. Ron Davis issued one-out walks to pitcher Hooton and Davey Lopes. Bill Russell singled to short left field, and Hooton unexpectedly rounded third and headed home. Dave Winfield stumbled on the wet grass, fell forward, and uncorked an errant throw. Hooton scored standing, after which Lemon pulled Davis in favor of Rick Reuschel. On Reuschel's second pitch, Lopes and Russell pulled a double steal. Reuschel walked Steve Garvey intentionally and gave up an RBI force-out to pinch-hitter Derrel Thomas. After Dusty Baker reached on an error by Nettles, loading the bases again, Guerrero singled in two more runs. The Yankees would score in the bottom of the sixth on a pinch-hit RBI single by Lou Piniella. Guerrero would cap a five-RBI night, and the Dodgers' World Series win, by blasting a solo home run in the eighth. Burt Hooton would pitch innings and get the win. Steve Howe replaced him and earned the save. Winfield's throw typified his struggles in this, his first World Series. At the plate, he went 1-for-22 with one RBI. After the series, Steinbrenner issued a public apology to the City of New York for his team's performance, while at the same time assuring the fans that plans to put the team together for 1982 would begin immediately. The Yankee owner was criticized by players and press alike for doing so, as many people felt losing a World Series was not something for which a team needed to apologize. For the first time, there were co-MVP's in a World Series: Cey (.350 avg., 7-for-20, HR, 6 RBIs), Yeager (.286 avg., 4-for-14, 2 HR's), and Guerrero (.333 avg, 7-for-21, 2 HR's, 7 RBIs) shared the award. Epilogue After combining for 10 division titles and eight World Series appearances between 1974 and 1981, the 1981 World Series marked the end of an era for both teams as they soon were without key contributors. The Yankees lost Reggie Jackson, Graig Nettles, Goose Gossage, and Tommy John, among others. The franchise would not reach the postseason again until 1995 and would not win another title until 1996. Key Dodger losses included Ron Cey, Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Reggie Smith, and Don Sutton. With a stronger farm system and adding valuable players via trade or free agency, they did win division titles in 1983 and 1985, while narrowly missing in 1982. Their success culminated with a world championship in 1988, becoming the only team to win two World Series between 1978 and 1990, and the only team to win more than one World Series title during the 1980s. However, since their 1988 World Series win, the Dodgers would not appear in another World Series until 2017 (which they lost to the Houston Astros), despite reaching the NLCS in 2008, 2009, 2013, and 2016. They would also appear in the World Series in 2018 against the Boston Red Sox, which they also lost. The Yankees, on the other hand, appeared in seven World Series (1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2009) in that span, winning all but 2001 and 2003.

Yankees pitcher George Frazier tied a World Series record for losing three of the six games in 1981. The only other pitcher to lose that many was the Chicago White Sox's Lefty Williams, who intentionally lost his three starts in the infamous 1919 World Series. Broadcasting ABC Sports covered this World Series on television in the United States, its third under the then-present contract of alternating Series coverage with NBC Sports. Keith Jackson and Al Michaels shared play-by-play duties, with Michaels replacing Jackson when the latter deferred to his primary role as ABC's lead college football announcer. Color commentary was handled by Howard Cosell and Baltimore Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer; Palmer would later join ABC's baseball broadcast team after retiring as a player. ABC's coverage was also simulcast over the Yankees' and Dodgers' local television outlets, respectively WPIX in New York City and KTTV in Los Angeles. This World Series was the last to be called by Jackson in the broadcast booth. Michaels became ABC's lead baseball play-by-play announcer (and exclusive World Series announcer) by the time the network next aired the World Series in 1983. On radio, CBS Radio carried the games with Vin Scully handling play-by-play and Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson providing analysis, working together for the third consecutive year. Scully was the Dodgers' primary local announcer during the regular season. When the Dodgers next appeared in the World Series in 1988, Scully called the series nationally on television for NBC. In popular culture After the series, Johnstone, Yeager, Reuss, and Rick Monday of the Dodgers recorded a cover version of Queen's \\"We Are the Champions\\" under the name \\"Big Blue Wrecking Crew\\". The quartet performed the song on an episode of Solid Gold, the syndicated TV- show. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fM2ejfXKTQ Notes See also *1981 Japan Series References * External links * 1981 NLCS Game 5 at MLB.com * 1981 NL West Playoff Game 1 at MLB.com * A Last Hurrah For Los Angeles at SI.com * 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers at baseballlibrary.com * 1981 New York Yankees at baseballlibrary.com World Series World Series Los Angeles Dodgers postseason New York Yankees postseason World Series World Series Sports competitions in New York City Sports competitions in Los Angeles October 1981 sports events in the United States World ","title":"1981 World Series"},{"id":"1218040","text":"Harry Cator VC, MM (24 January 1894 - 7 April 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was born in Drayton in Norfolk to a railway worker. After leaving school, he was a porter on the London Midland and Great Northern Joint Line before joining a building contractor in Great Yarmouth. He joined the British Army in September 1914, and arrived on the Western Front in June 1915 already a sergeant in the 7th Battalion, The East Surrey Regiment. In 1916 at the time of the Somme Offensive, he was awarded the Military Medal for bringing back 36 wounded men from no-mans land. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Arras offensive. On 9 April 1917 near Arras, Sergeant Cator's platoon had suffered heavy casualties from a hostile machine-gun. Under heavy fire the sergeant, with one man, advanced across the open to attack the gun and when his companion was killed, he went on alone. Picking up a Lewis gun and some ammunition drums on his way, he succeeded in reaching the enemy trench and sighting another hostile machine-gun, he killed the entire team and the officer. He held the end of the trench with such effect that a bombing squad were able to capture 100 prisoners and five machine-guns. A few days later he was injured by an exploding shell. It was shortly after that the award of the VC and the French Croix de Guerre were announced. After the war he worked as a postman and as a civil servant. Cator served with the rank of captain in the Home Guard during the Second World War, and was commandant of a prisoner-of-war camp near Cranwick. He retired from the Army in December 1947.

His Victoria Cross was won for his actions in September 1918 on the Western Front during the First World War. Early life Hall was born on 11 August 1896 in the Sydney suburb of Granville, New South Wales, to a livestock farmer and his wife. After attending school in Bathurst, he worked with his father on properties near Nyngan. Military career In April 1916, at the age of 19, Hall enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). After training, he was posted to 54th Battalion, then serving on the Western Front in France. He was wounded in late March 1917, within two months of arriving in France. Back in the front lines by late April, he saw action during the Battle of Bullecourt and later, during the second phase of the Battle of Passchendaele, in the Battle of Polygon Wood. He was promoted to corporal after this latter battle. The battalion was involved in fighting on the Somme from early to mid-1918, including the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. It was then involved in the Hundred Days Offensive which began in August. On 1 September 1918 at Péronne, Somme, Hall rushed a machine-gun post, shooting four of the enemy and capturing nine, with two guns. Continuously in advance of the main party, he personally led assault parties, capturing many small parties of the enemy and machine-guns. On the morning of 2 September during a heavy barrage, he carried to safety a comrade who had been dangerously wounded and was in urgent need of medical attention. It was for these actions that Hall was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the Battle of St. Quentin Canal, Hall's battalion amalgamated with the 56th Battalion in October 1918, becoming the 54th/56th Battalion. He was promoted to sergeant with this unit before being discharged from the AIF in August 1919. Later life After the war, Hall returned to the Nyngan district and purchased his own property, Gundooee station, for farming. He married in 1927. During the Second World War, Hall served for a time as a lieutenant in a garrison unit but returned to farming sheep and cattle once his service was no longer required. Active in community affairs, he died in the district hospital on 25 February 1978, survived by his wife and four children Helen, George, Dennis and Charles. He is buried at St Matthew's Church in West Bogan, while his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, in Canberra.

Cambridge was 35 years old and a Bombardier in the Royal Regiment of Artillery, British Army when he carried out the actions during the Crimean War for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 8 September 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimea, Cambridge volunteered for the spiking party on the assault on the Redan. He remained with the party after being severely wounded twice, but had refused to leave until the general retirement was ordered, and even then he repeatedly went back into the open to carry wounded men to safety. In the latter part of the day, he sprang forward to bring in another wounded man. While carrying the helpless infantryman to the safety of the trench Daniel was seen to stagger. Subsequently, Daniel was found to have been shot a third time, in his right jaw, and, incapacitated, he took no further part in the action. Background Cambridge was born in Carrickfergus, Co. Antrim, Ireland, on 27 June 1820 to Archibald Cambridge and Bridget, formerly Murray. Attesting in Lisburn, Co. Antrim, on 20 June 1839 he gave his occupation as labourer and he is recorded as being 5 feet 8 inches tall with a fresh complexion, dark grey eyes and brown hair. He enlisted four days later as a Driver and Gunner in the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Artillery, on 24 June 1839. He served with the 2nd Company, 4th Battalion, in Malta (1841–1847) and was then posted to Canada with the 7th Battalion in 1848. On 28 August 1849 he married Ann Bigham, an Irish lass, whose parents were James Bigham and Ann, formerly Young, in Notre- Dame de Québec, Canada East. On 21 November 1853 Cambridge's posting to Canada came to an end and he and Ann, now expecting their first child, found themselves on the way to England and the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, the home of the Royal Artillery. Crimea In March 1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia, beginning the Crimean War, and Cambridge briefly reverted to the 4th Battalion in Woolwich, Kent, before transferring to the 8th Company, 11th Battalion the following month. In June he embarked with his regiment for the Crimea, passing through Scutari and Varna and disembarked on the Crimean Peninsula with the siege train on 19 September 1854. On 8 October 1854 the besiegement of Sebastopol by sea and land began and on 17 October Sebastopol was bombarded by 126 British and French guns. Cambridge took part in the defeat of the Russians at Inkerman on 5 November and then returned to Sebastopol. On 3 April 1855, Gunner and Driver Daniel Cambridge was promoted to Bombardier, according to his record of service preserved in WO 10/2231 at the National Archives, Kew, London. On 9 April Sebastopol was again bombarded with 501 Allied guns, 101 of them British. Sebastopol was bombarded for the third time on 6 June 1855 and Mamelon and the Quarries were captured by the Allies. The 17 and 18 June saw the fourth bombardment of Sebastopol followed by the 1st assaults on the Malakov and Redan. The 17 August saw the fifth bombardment of Sebastopol with 600 Allied guns, which lasted for four days. The sixth and final bombardment, which began on 5 September with 775 Allied guns, lasted for 3 days. On 8 September Cambridge accepted Capt. Davis' invitation to join the spiking party for the British assault on the Redan. The French assaulted the Malakov, which they took by surprise without loss, the Russians being at dinner. But the British were cut down by the Russian's murderous fire from the Redan into the Quarries. As the Artillerymen's spiking party were unable to spike the Russian guns the Gunners helped and carried as many of the wounded infantrymen to safety as they could. The despatches relating to the incident record him as being severely wounded. Explosions were heard during the night and a small party advanced to find the Redan deserted. On the following day, 9 September 1855, the Russian army retired by a bridge of boats to the north to evacuate the south side of Sebastopol and their navy sank all their ships of war in the harbour, which signalled Russia’s capitulation. On 29 January 1856, in a final futile act, Russian guns bombarded Sebastopol and on 1 February Russia accepted preliminary peace terms in Vienna. On 25 February the Congress of Paris convened to begin peace negotiations and the Armistice was signed on 29 February. Cambridge returned with his regiment to Woolwich in March and on 30 March final peace was agreed, the Treaty of Paris was signed and the Congress of Paris was concluded. On 21 April 1856 Cambridge was promoted Serjeant with 7th Company, 11th Battalion. A copy of the original hand-written citation sent to the Adjutant-General of the Forces on 19 December 1856 can be found in a manuscript book (MS C1,171E.) in the Library of the Royal Artillery and states: Lieutenant Colonel H. F. Strange CB commanded his Company and Captain Gronow Davis commanded the spiking party. Capt. Gronow Davis also received the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Redan on 8 September 1855. In April 1857 Cambridge was promoted to Quarter Master Serjeant. The London Gazette of 23 June 1857 announced the award of the Victoria Cross to Serjeant Daniel Cambridge, and gave the citation as follows: Shortly after Cambridge also received the Al Valore Militare, the Sardinian Military Medal of Valour, for which the citation read: Cambridge was the twenty-second of the original sixty two medal recipients who received the Cross from Queen Victoria at the first VC Investiture in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857. Later life Later in 1857 Daniel was promoted to Master Gunner with the 8th Coastal Battery, Athlone, Co. Roscommon, Ireland. On 21 February 1862 Daniel was posted to Fort Tarbert, Co. Kerry, Ireland. In 1861 Cambridge received the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal for 22 years of military service. On 12 July 1865 Daniel wrote to JA Brown, author of \\"England's Artillerymen\\", from Fort Tarbert, Co. Kerry: Cambridge was pensioned as a Master Gunner after completing thirty-two years' service on 27 June 1871. In that same year Cambridge was appointed to the sovereign’s bodyguard the Yeomen of the Guard. thumb The other medals he wore with his Victoria Cross are the British Crimean War medal (with clasps Inkerman and Sebastopol). Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, Sardinian Al Valore Militare and Turkish Crimean War medal (Sardinian Issue). Cambridge died from the wounds received in the Crimean War on 4 June 1882 at 57 Frederick Place, Plumstead, aged 62 years, and was survived by his wife, Ann, formerly Bigham, and their children William (born in Woolwich in 1854), Mary (Athlone 1857), Agnes (Athlone 1859), Daniel (Athlone 1861), Catherine (Tarbert 1865) and Elizabeth (Tarbert 1865).

The parish includes the hamlets of Maiden Head and East Dundry. The parish had a 2011 population of 829. The village lies on the route of the Monarch's Way long-distance footpath. It is a popular destination for the people of Bristol as it is known for its panoramic views of the city. History According to Robinson the name means 'The hill that is dry' from the Old English dun and dryge. An alternative derivation is from a Celtic name, meaning fort of refuge. The parish was part of the hundred of Chew. Dundry is notable for its stone: the yellow oolitic limestone from local quarries such as Dundry Main Road South Quarry and the Dundry Downs (to the west of the village) is found even at Cardiff Castle, a fort originally built by the Romans to defend against Anglo-Saxon invasions. The stone was much used in medieval Bristol: an outstanding example being St Mary Redcliffe, an Anglican church in central Bristol. A large cube of stone (approximately 1.5m each edge) still stands in the churchyard: the cube is much considered to be an early advertisement for Dundry stone. The neighbouring village of Chew Magna has in its graveyard an early 19th-century limestone round-topped stone which bears the inscription to William Fowler \\"shot by an Highwayman on Dundry Hill 14 June 1814 aged 32 years\\". =Second World War= Being so close to Bristol, Dundry caught many of the 77 air raids (mostly in 1940 and 1941) for which Bristol had: * 919 tons of high-explosive bombs and myriad incendiary bombs * 1299 persons killed * 81,830 houses destroyed.Blitz over Britain by Edwin Webb and John Duncan 1990, page 90 Many bombs and anti-aircraft shells landed in Dundry.

Captain Knight of Walnut Farm, East Dundry served in the First World War and was in charge of the Dundry Home Guard. Fire watchers turned out to watch for fires whenever there were bombing raids. Just south of Rattledown Farm in East Dundry, there was a bonfires-lit, dummy-town decoy area attempting to deflect bombing from Bristol. In 1941, there was a Home Guard exercise for Dundry and neighbouring villages including Winford, Bishopsworth, Leigh Woods and Norton Malreward. =1968 storm= On 10 July 1968 a storm deluged the parish and neighbouring areas— of rain was measured in Chew Stoke, and local streams such as Winford Brook were swollen by rain running off the slopes of Dundry Hill. Governance view of part of the village taken from the church tower. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish is in the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. This act established a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

The 77th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies and the American League (AL) champion Kansas City Royals. The Phillies defeated the Royals in six games to secure their first World Series championship in franchise history; third baseman Mike Schmidt was named the World Series MVP. The series concluded with Game 6 in Philadelphia, which ended with closer Tug McGraw striking out Willie Wilson at 11:29 pm EDT on Tuesday, October 21. Wilson set a World Series record by striking out 12 times in the six-game set (after 230 hits (and 81 strikeouts) in the regular season). Game 6 is also significant because it stands as the most-watched game in World Series history, with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers. The Kansas City Royals became the second expansion team, and the first from the American League, to appear in the World Series. The AL had to wait until before one of their expansion teams—the Royals—won a World Series. This was the first of four World Series played entirely on artificial turf (1985, , ). This was also the first World Series since 1920, and the most recent, in which neither team had a previous World Series title. With their victory, the Phillies became the final team out of the original 16 MLB teams to win a World Series. However, a Philadelphia team had won a World Series before, the last being the Athletics in , exactly a half-century earlier; in a twist of fate, the Athletics played 13 years in Kansas City (1955–1967) before relocating to Oakland. Background The Philadelphia Phillies won the National League East division by one game over the Montreal Expos then defeated the Houston Astros, three games to two, to win the National League Championship Series. The Kansas City Royals won the American League West division by 14 games over the Oakland Athletics then swept the New York Yankees for the American League pennant. Two first-year managers, Dallas Green of the Phillies and Jim Frey of the Royals, found themselves with an opportunity to do what no other manager had done before them, win a first World Championship for their respective clubs. This was the first appearance for the Phillies since losing to the New York Yankees in the and just their third overall, having lost also to the Boston Red Sox in . The Royals entered the league as an expansion team in 1969. They had early success under the leadership of Whitey Herzog, winning their division from 1976 to 1978, but lost each year to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), finally exacting revenge with a sweep of the Yankees in 1980. The Phillies had a strikingly similar run entering this Series, as they were also divisional winners from 1976 to 1978, but lost three straight NLCS: to the Cincinnati Reds in 1976, and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, they finally triumphed, rallying on the road to eliminate the Houston Astros. =Philadelphia Phillies= The Phillies seemed to have it all, including eventual 1980 Most Valuable Player, third-baseman Mike Schmidt (48 HR, 121 RBI, .286 BA) and Cy Young Award winner, lefty Steve Carlton (24–9, 2.34 ERA). This mostly veteran club finished between first and third in almost all offensive categories in the National League. Thirty-nine- year-old Pete Rose led the club in hits (185) and doubles (42), while speedsters center fielder Garry Maddox and utility outfielder Lonnie Smith combined for 68 steals. The pitching staff was just good enough, led by Carlton and 17-game-winner Dick Ruthven. In the bullpen was the ever enthusiastic screwballer Tug McGraw, who was making his third trip to the Series, having ridden the bench with the New York Mets, winning in and losing in . =Kansas City Royals= The Royals had a Most Valuable Player of their own in the indomitable superstar, third-baseman George Brett, who flirted with the sacred .400 mark all summer with an average above .400 as late as September 19, before settling for a .390 batting average, with 24 homers and 118 RBI in 117 games. The unquestioned heart and soul of the Royals was surrounded by a solid corps of veterans: Amos Otis, super-designated-hitter Hal McRae, solid second-baseman Frank White, and switch-hitting leadoff man Willie Wilson, who finished the season with 230 hits and 79 stolen bases. Six KC pitchers had ten or more wins, led by 20-game-winner Dennis Leonard (20–11, 3.79) and left-hander Larry Gura (18–10, 2.95). Submariner closer Dan Quisenberry won 12 games out of the bullpen and accumulated 33 saves, tied for best in the American League with Rich Gossage. Summary Matchups =Game 1= Phillies' starter Bob Walk became the third rookie to start the first game of a World Series, the first since Joe Black of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952. The Royals jumped on him early with a pair of two-run home runs: in the second, Amos Otis lifted one to left after a leadoff walk of Darrell Porter, and Willie Aikens went over right-center with two outs in the third, following Hal McRae's single up the middle and a called strikeout of George Brett. The K.C. threat continued until Porter was thrown out at home. In their half of the third, the Phils rallied off Dennis Leonard. Shortstop Larry Bowa singled with one out, stole second and scored on catcher Bob Boone's double. Lonnie Smith's RBI single then cut the Royals' lead to 4–2, but Smith was caught in a rundown heading back to first, which allowed Boone to score. With the bases clear and two outs, Pete Rose was hit on the calf and Mike Schmidt walked on five pitches. Bake McBride launched the first pitch to right-center for a three-run home run and the Phillies led 5–4; designated hitter Greg Luzinski fanned for the third out. In the fourth inning, Manny Trillo chopped a high bouncer over Leonard for an infield single, advanced to second on an errant pickoff throw, and to third as Bowa bounced to second for the second out. Ninth in the order and with a 3-1 count, Boone doubled again to score Trillo and knock Leonard out of the game. Reliever Renie Martin retired Smith on a flyout to right. After loading the bases in the fifth with one out on a single, hit-by-pitch, and walk off Martin, Garry Maddox's sacrifice fly to left on full count scored Schmidt for a 7–4 lead. Trillo popped out to first to end the threat. Hitless Brett opened the eighth with a double to left-center off of Walk, and went to third on a wild pitch to Aikens, who hit another two-run home run to right-center to cut the lead to one. Closer Tug McGraw entered with the bases clear and no outs, faced the minimum in the final two innings for a 7–6 Phillies victory. Prior to this victory, the Phillies had not won a World Series game since Game 1 in against the Boston Red Sox, when Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a shutout. =Game 2= Game 2 was a pitchers' duel between left-handers Larry Gura and Steve Carlton. After a one-out single and subsequent double in the fifth, Manny Trillo's sacrifice fly and Larry Bowa's RBI single put the Phillies up 2–0. The Royals cut it to 2–1 when Amos Otis scored from second on Trillo's error on Willie Aikens's ground ball in the sixth. Carlton looked in control until, acting on a complaint from Kansas City manager Jim Frey that he was using a foreign substance on the ball; the umpires made Carlton wash his hands.During Game 2 of the 2006 World Series on October 22, 2006, the television announcers on Fox related this story when the FOX cameras picked up an inexplicable foreign substance on Kenny Rogers's hand. In the seventh, Carlton loaded the bases on three walks, the last intentional, and Otis ripped a double into the left-field corner to drive in two, then John Wathan's sacrifice fly to center extended the Royals' lead to 4–2; questionably, Otis was caught in a rundown after also tagging up from second; Rose cut the ball and threw to Schmidt, who tagged him halfway back to second to end the inning. The Phillies rallied in the eighth inning off closer Dan Quisenberry; after a leadoff walk to Bob Boone, pinch hitter Del Unser's RBI double to left-center cut the Royals' lead to 4–3. A groundout to first by Pete Rose advanced Unser to third, and a high-chopper single by Bake McBride over the drawn-in infield tied the score. Mike Schmidt drove in McBride to take the lead with a double off the wall in right-center, then scored on Keith Moreland's single up the middle to lead by two. Pinch hitter Greg Gross grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Ron Reed took over for Carlton in the ninth, struck out two, and held the Royals scoreless for the save as Philadelphia went up 2–0 heading to Kansas City. =Game 3= K.C. got back in the series with a thrilling extra inning victory in Game 3. George Brett, having returned from minor surgery after Game 2, began the scoring with a Home Run into the right-field stands in the first off Dick Ruthven. The Phillies loaded the bases in the second off Rich Gale with one out on two singles and a walk, but only scored once on Lonnie Smith's groundout. In the fourth, Willie Aikens tripled with one out and scored on Hal McRae's single, but Mike Schmidt's home run in the fifth again tied the game and knocked Gale out of the game. Amos Otis gave the Royals a 3–2 lead in the seventh with a home run, but Pete Rose's RBI single with two on in the eighth off Renie Martin (who had relieved Gale) again tied the game. Ruthven pitched nine innings and was relieved in the tenth. The game headed into extra innings and in the bottom of the tenth, Willie Aikens drove in Willie Wilson with a single to left-center for the game-winning run off Tug McGraw. =Game 4= A beautiful Saturday afternoon was the setting for Game 4. The Royals jumped all over Phillies starter Larry Christenson in the bottom of the first. Willie Wilson doubled, George Brett tripled him in, and Willie Aikens smashed his third home run of the series. The onslaught continued when Amos Otis doubled in Hal McRae, who had also doubled, to give the Royals a 4–0 lead right out of the gate. Christenson would only last of an inning before being relieved. After the Phillies scored a run in the second on Larry Bowa's RBI single off Dennis Leonard, Aikens hit his second home run of the game in the bottom half and became the first player in World Series history to have a pair of two-home run games. The Phillies cut away at the Royals' lead on sacrifice flies by Bob Boone off Leonard in the seventh and Mike Schmidt off Dan Quisenberry in the eighth (the run charged to Leonard), but fell short as Leonard held them in check and Dan Quisenberry finished the game to help Leonard atone for his Game 1 loss. The Royals won 5–3 to tie the series. Despite the Royals victory, Game 4 is best remembered for Dickie Noles' fourth-inning brushback pitch under Brett's chin that ultimately prompted the umpires to issue warnings to each team. Brett told Baseball Digest in March 1998 that he had \\"no idea if that [brushback pitch by Noles] turned the Series around. All I know is we lost.\\" Mike Schmidt, in his book Clearing The Bases, called it \\"the greatest brushback in World Series history.\\" Aikens later said that he had been expecting it to happen to him, in retaliation for his two home runs. =Game 5= Played in the afternoon sun and shadows, pivotal Game Five was scoreless through the first three innings. In top of the fourth, Pete Rose laced a line drive off starter Larry Gura, but was thrown out by second baseman Frank White. Bake McBride dragged a bunt to Gura, but first baseman Willie Aikens' foot was not on the base. On a 2–2 count, Mike Schmidt homered to center to put the Phillies up 2–0. Greg Luzinski grounded out to third and Keith Moreland popped out to third. In the bottom of the fifth, U L Washington singled to center and Willie Wilson hit a grounder between shortstop and third that was an infield single. After a sacrifice bunt from White that nearly went for a hit, George Brett's RBI groundout to second off Marty Bystrom cut the Phillies' lead to 2–1. Aikens walked, but Hal McRae flew out to the base of the right field foul pole to strand Wilson at third. In the Kansas City sixth, red-hot Amos Otis tied the game with a leadoff home run to left. After solid singles by Clint Hurdle and Darrell Porter put runners on the corners with no outs, Bystrom was relieved by Ron Reed, who allowed a sacrifice fly to left by Washington which put the Royals up 3–2. Wilson doubled to right, but Porter was thrown out at home by Manny Trillo's relay and White fouled out to third. In the top of the seventh, Schmidt flew out to right, and Luzinski walked. Smith came in to run and Moreland singled, ending Gura's day. Closer Dan Quisenberry induced fielder's choice groundouts by Maddox and Trillo to end the threat. In the bottom half against closer Tug McGraw, Brett and Aikens struck out swinging, then McRae doubled to left. Otis was intentionally walked, and José Cardenal batted for Hurdle, but flew out to center on the first pitch. In the Phillies' eighth, Bowa nearly beat out a grounder out to second, then Bob Boone reached on a low throw by Brett and continued to second. Rose grounded out to second and Boone went to third, but was stranded when McBride also grounded to second. In the bottom half, Porter grounded out to second, Washington fanned, and Wilson chopped a slow grounder towards third, but was thrown out by McGraw. Down by a run, Schmidt led off the ninth inning with an infield single off of drawn-in third baseman Brett's glove. Pinch hitter Del Unser drove him home from first with a double that bounced over Aikens' glove and into the right-field corner. After a bunt down the first base line by Moreland moved Unser to third, Garry Maddox grounded to third for the second out. On an 0–2 count, Trillo drove in the go-ahead run with a line shot that ricocheted off Quisenberry for an infield hit, almost thrown out by Brett. Bowa grounded to shortstop on a high hopper to end the inning. In the bottom of the ninth, White led off with a walk, Brett was caught looking, Aikens walked on four pitches, and was lifted for pinch runner Onix Concepción. McRae hit a fly well down the line that was just foul, then grounded to shortstop for a fielder's choice. Otis walked on four pitches to load the bases, but McGraw silenced the crowd by striking out Cardenal with an inside fastball on a 1–2 count to end the game. =Game 6= With a chance to close out the Series at home in Game 6, Steve Carlton was the starter for Philadelphia. In the bottom of the third, Bob Boone walked, then was safe at second on Lonnie Smith's ground ball, as shortstop U L Washington was past the base when he caught the ball from second baseman Frank White. Pete Rose then bunted for a single down the third base line to load the bases. Mike Schmidt's single to right-center scored two, which ended Royals' starter Rich Gale's night. Renie Martin entered with runners at the corners and no outs and retired the side: Bake McBride fouled out, Greg Luzinski hit a soft liner to third, and Garry Maddox flew to right. In the fifth, Smith hustled to turn a routine single to left-center into a double, advanced to third on Rose's fly to left-center, and Schmidt walked on a full count. Lefthander Paul Splittorff relieved Martin, and McBride's slow groundout to shortstop moved up both runners to put the Phillies up 3–0. Luzinski also grounded out to shortstop. Next inning, Maddox singled to left, but Manny Trillo grounded back to Splittorff for 1-6-3 double play. On a 2–2 count, Larry Bowa doubled to left and scored on Boone's single to center, making it 4–0 Phillies. Smith flew out to right-center. John Wathan walked on eight pitches to lead off the eighth and José Cardenal singled to left to end Carlton's night, relieved by closer Tug McGraw. White fouled out to first, Willie Wilson walked on five pitches to load the bases. Washington flew to left-center center for a sacrifice fly, George Brett got an infield hit to reload the bases, but Hal McRae grounded out to second. In the bottom half, closer Dan Quisenberry set the Phillies down in order (Maddox, Trillo, Bowa). In the top of the ninth, Amos Otis was caught looking on a breaker, Willie Aikens drew a walk on full count, and Onix Concepción came in to run. Wathan singled to right, and Cardenal singled to center to load the bases. White fouled out on the first pitch, bobbled by Boone and caught by Rose in front of the Phillies' dugout. Wilson fell behind on an 0–2 count, took a pitch slightly high, then fanned on a fastball to end the Series. It was the 12th time Wilson struck out in this Series, setting a new World Series record. The previous mark of 11 had been held jointly by Eddie Mathews and Wayne Garrett in and , respectively. It stood until , when Ryan Howard struck out 13 times, ironically on a Phillies team which lost to the New York Yankees. Boone's knees were so sore by the end of the World Series that he could barely make it to the mound after the final out was recorded. When the World Series began in , the National and American Leagues each had eight teams. With their victory in the 1980, the Phillies became the last of the \\"Original Sixteen\\" franchises to win a Series (although the St. Louis Browns never won a Series in St. Louis, waiting until , twelve years after becoming the Baltimore Orioles). While third baseman Schmidt was the official MVP of the 1980 World Series, the Babe Ruth Award (another World Series MVP) was given to closer McGraw. Composite box 1980 World Series (4–2): Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.) over Kansas City Royals (A.L.) Broadcasting NBC broadcast the Series on television, with play-by-play announcer Joe Garagiola, color commentators Tony Kubek and Tom Seaver, and field reporter Merle Harmon. Bryant Gumbel anchored the pre- and post-game shows, while former pitching great Bob Gibson and umpire Ron Luciano also contributed to NBC's coverage. Independent station WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, the Phillies' television rights holder, simulcasted NBC's broadcast to its local viewers. Phillies broadcasters Richie Ashburn, Harry Kalas, Tim McCarver, and Andy Musser hosted a locally produced pregame show prior to each of the six games. CBS Radio also carried the Series nationally, with Vin Scully handling the play-by-play and Sparky Anderson the color commentary. Win Elliot anchored the pre- and post-game shows for the network. At this time CBS Radio held total broadcast exclusivity for the World Series, including in each team's market. Thousands of Phillies fans were outraged that they could not hear their local team announcers call the games. They deluged the team, the networks, and the Commissioner's office with angry letters and petitions. The following year Major League Baseball changed its broadcast contract to allow the flagship radio stations for participating World Series teams to produce and air their own local Series broadcasts, beginning in . The CBS Radio feed could potentially be heard in those markets on another station which held CBS's rights. When the Phillies next won a World Series, in , Kalas was able to make the call of the final out. This Series is tied with the 1978 World Series for the highest overall television ratings to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. Aftermath Minutes after the final out, Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh issued a proclamation declaring the next day \\"Philadelphia Phillies Day\\" in the state. That day, a parade down Broad Street celebrated the Phillies win. About half a million attended the parade, the first ticker-tape parade down Broad Street since the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1975, as it made its way to John F. Kennedy Stadium. Another 800,000 gathered around the stadium. The parade was part of a day of statewide celebrations throughout Pennsylvania, per Thornburgh's proclamation. In 1980, all four of Philadelphia's major professional sports teams played for the championship of their respective sports, but only the Phillies were victorious. The Sixers lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in mid-May, eight days later the Flyers lost to the New York Islanders, and the Eagles would lose to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV in January 1981. In conjunction with championships won by two teams from Pittsburgh (the Pirates won the World Series a year before, and the Steelers won Super Bowls XIII and XIV), the state of Pennsylvania as a whole had three title teams in a span of two years. Soon after the World Series, members of both teams played for a week on Family Feud with host Richard Dawson. The week of shows was billed as a World Series Rematch Week. The Royals won three out of the five games played, with all the money going to charity. The 1980 World Series was the first of numerous World Series that journeyman outfielder Lonnie Smith (then with the Phillies) participated in. He was also a part of the 1982 World Series (as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals), 1985 World Series (as a member of the Kansas City Royals), and the and 1992 World Series as a member of the Atlanta Braves. The two Braves seasons were the only years in which he played for the losing team in the Series.

Early life Gabar Singh Negi, was born on 21 April 1895 at Manjaur village near Chamba, in the Indian district of Tehri. The area is in the Himalayas and was part of the original Kingdom of Garhwal, Uttarakhand. He joined the 2nd Battalion of The Garhwal Rifles, a regiment of the British Indian Army, in October 1913; the personnel of the regiment were mainly from the Himalayan hill tribes of garhwal region of Uttarakhand. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, the 39th Garhwal Rifles was among the regiments selected for the Indian Expeditionary Force A, destined for the Western Front in France. By October 1914, the regiment, as part of the 7th (Meerut) Division, was in the frontlines during the First Battle of Ypres and later in the Pas-de-Calais sector where it would remain until going into reserve at the end of that year. In March 1915, the 7th Division was selected to be involved in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which called for an assault on the German lines at Neuve Chapelle. The 7th Division was to help force a gap for the Cavalry Corps to exploit. On 10 March 1915, during the battle, Negi's 2nd Battalion was attacking to the southwest of Neuve Chappelle; an artillery barrage that preceded the attack was not effective and the German trenches were well defended. Parties with bombs had to clear the trenches; one such party included Negi. When the commander of his party was killed, he took over, leading from the front as the party took control of the German trenches. He was later killed. His actions on 10 March led to him being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows: Negi has no known grave; his name is recorded on the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial, as Gobar Sing Negi. His name was one of those included on the dome of the Memorial Gates in London, unveiled in 2002. Victoria Cross Negi's VC was sent to the India Office to be forwarded to his next of kin, Satoori Devi, his wife. The VC was acquired by his regiment which arranged for a replica to be sent to Devi. A letter of condolences from Queen Mary was also sent to Devi. The medal was a source of pride for Negi's widow, who would wear it until her death in 1981. Legacy Descendants of Negi have organised the Gabar Singh Negi Fair annually at Chamba in his memory, held every 20 or 21 April since 1925, depending on the Hindu calendar. His regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, have maintained a presence since 1971. A recruitment rally, stalls and army bands provide entertainment and many villagers, particularly the youths, attend the fair because of the drawcard of the recruitment rally.

The 85th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers, with the Dodgers upsetting the heavily favored Athletics to win the Series in five games. It is best known for the pinch-hit walk-off home run hit by Dodgers outfielder Kirk Gibson, who could barely walk due to injuries suffered during the NL Championship Series, against Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley in Game 1. The Dodgers were the only MLB team to win more than one World Series title in the 1980s; their other World Series title during the decade came in 1981 (they also broke a 10-year streak of 10 different World Series champions going back to 1978). Although Gibson's home run has become an iconic World Series moment, it was World Series MVP Orel Hershiser who capped a dominant 1988 season in which he set the all time scoreless inning streak at 59 innings, recorded five straight shutouts, led the league with 23 wins and 267 innings, and won the Cy Young and Gold Glove awards. Hershiser was the NL Championship Series MVP, starting three games, getting the save for Game 4, and shutting out the Mets in Game 7. In the World Series, he shut out the A's in Game 2, and pitched a two-run, complete game in the decisive Game 5 victory. The Dodgers won the NL West division by seven games over the Cincinnati Reds, then upset the New York Mets, 4 games to 3, in the NLCS. The Athletics won the AL West division by 13 games over the Minnesota Twins, then swept the Boston Red Sox, 4 games to 0, in the AL Championship Series. Preview =Los Angeles Dodgers= The Dodgers' team batting did not finish in the top five in any offensive statistical category except batting average (fifth), at .248—no regular or backup hit over .300 or drove in over 90 runs. Kirk Gibson's 25 home runs led the team but was only good enough for seventh in the National League. Slugger Pedro Guerrero had a sub-par year and was traded in July to the Cardinals for starting pitcher John Tudor. Kirk Gibson was the only position player named to the All-Star Game, but declined the invitation. However, the Dodgers were sixth in the NL in runs scored and backed that up with excellent pitching. Despite trading All-Star pitcher Bob Welch (to Oakland, ironically) prior to spring training and an injury to Fernando Valenzuela (5–8, 4.24 ERA), the Dodgers were second in the NL in team ERA and runs allowed, and led the league in complete games and shutouts. The staff was anchored by Cy Young Award-winner Orel Hershiser, who led league in wins, won- loss percentage (23–8, .864), complete games (15), shutouts (8), and sacrifice hits (19). Hershiser was backed-up by a pair of \\"Tims\\", Tim Leary (17–11, 2.91) and rookie Tim Belcher (12–6, 2.91), and the July acquisition of John Tudor further strengthened the staff. The bullpen was outstanding, headed by Jay Howell (21 saves, 2.08), Alejandro Peña (12 saves, 1.91), and longtime New York Mets closer Jesse Orosco. The Dodger bullpen led the league in saves with 49. It was intensity and fortitude, however, that defined the 1988 Dodgers, a trend that began when Kirk Gibson was signed as a free agent over the winter from the Detroit Tigers, the team he helped lead to the 1984 World Championship. Moreover, the invincible Hershiser threw shutouts in five of his last six regular season starts en route to a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched, breaking the mark held by former Dodger great Don Drysdale. Hershiser would dominate the Mets in the NLCS, while Gibson hobbled through on bad knees and a bruised hamstring but would produce a memorable, if not the greatest, at-bat (in Game 1) of the World Series. =Oakland Athletics= The powerful Oakland Athletics had all the confidence and swagger of a heavily favored team. The \\"Bash Brothers\\" duo of Mark McGwire (32 home runs, 99 RBI, .260 batting average) and José Canseco (42 home runs, 124 RBI, .307 batting average) were in their early 20s, emerging as young superstars. Canseco became the first player to hit 40 or more home runs and steal 40 or more bases in Major League history and would capture the Most Valuable Player award in the American League. Veterans Dave Henderson (24 home runs, 94 RBI, .304 batting average) and longtime Pirate Dave Parker (12 home runs, 55 RBI, .257 batting average), also contributed with both their bats and their experience. The 1988 World Series marked Don Baylor's third consecutive World Series with three separate teams. Besides being a member of the 1988 Athletics, Baylor was also a member of the 1986 Boston Red Sox and 1987 Minnesota Twins. The Oakland pitching staff was quite possibly the best in the American League in 1988. They led in ERA (3.44), wins (104), saves (64), and were second in strikeouts (983) and second in fewest runs allowed and home runs allowed. The ace of the staff was Dave Stewart, an ex-Dodger (1978–83), who won 20 games for the second straight season. Another ex-Dodger was reliable Bob Welch (17–9, 3.64) followed by 16-game winner Storm Davis. After spending the previous 12 years as a starter, mostly for the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, Dennis Eckersley would be converted into a closer in 1987 and would lead the American League in saves in 1988 with 45. He would eventually have a distinguished 24-year career, gaining election into the Hall of Fame in 2004. Another longtime starter (and another ex-Dodger), Rick Honeycutt, proved to be a capable set-up man to Eckersley, finishing with three wins and seven saves. But anything can happen in a short series, as proven by these 1988 Los Angeles Dodgers, who out-hit (41–28, .246–.177), out-muscled (5 HRs–2 HRs), and out-pitched (2.03–3.92) the seemingly unbeatable Oakland Athletics, incredibly winning the Series in five games, outscoring the A's, 21–11, bringing the Dodgers their sixth World Series Championship, the second as a manager for Tommy Lasorda. Summary Matchups =Game 1= With Gibson unable to start and officially listed as day-to-day due to a pulled left hamstring and a severely swollen right knee, both sustained on awkward slides into second base in the NLCS in Games 5 and 7, the Dodgers were at a decided disadvantage. Additionally, because ace Orel Hershiser pitched in Game 7 of the NLCS, the Dodgers had to start rookie Tim Belcher in Game 1, and thus, they would not be able to start Hershiser three times in a potential seven game series as they had in the NLCS. Meanwhile, Oakland, having swept the ALCS, could send a well- rested Dave Stewart to the mound. Both pitchers, however, would have their troubles in this game starting out. Belcher loaded the bases in the first by giving up a single to Dave Henderson, then hitting José Canseco and walking Mark McGwire. Canseco was hit in the right biceps as he checked his swing and home plate umpire Doug Harvey awarded him first base. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda disputed this, thinking the ball hit Canseco's bat. Audio from the game seemed to confirm this, but replays showed the ball hit Canseco in the biceps. Stewart's problems began in the bottom of the first when he purposely hit Steve Sax with his first pitch. After retiring Franklin Stubbs, Stewart balked Sax to second. Mickey Hatcher, Gibson’s replacement in the starting lineup who had hit only one homer all season, then shocked the crowd by hitting a two-run shot off Stewart. Hatcher further excited the Dodger stadium fans by running full speed around the bases. Commentator Joe Garagiola noted, \\"He ran in like they thought they were going to take it off the scoreboard! He really circled those bases in a hurry!\\" and \\"He's a Saturday Evening Post cover!\\" Stewart would calm down, however, and the A's provided him a lead in their half of the second. After allowing a leadoff single to Glenn Hubbard and striking out Walt Weiss, Belcher's control problems continued as he walked both Stewart and Carney Lansford to load the bases. After Dave Henderson struck out, Canseco crushed a 1–0 pitch for a grand slam to almost dead center, denting an NBC game camera in the process. The A's had a 4–2 lead. Canseco's grand slam in Game 1 was his only hit of the series. His fellow Bash Brother Mark McGwire had only one hit as well, the game-winning shot that ended Game 3. In the sixth, the Dodgers broke Stewart's groove with three consecutive one-out singles by Mike Marshall, John Shelby and Mike Scioscia, in which the third one by Scioscia scored Marshall. Stewart retired the next two batters to strand Shelby in scoring position but the A's lead was cut to 4–3. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and commentator Vin Scully, working for NBC for the 1988 postseason, observed that Gibson was \\"nowhere to be found\\". This spurred Gibson to tell Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. While Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, NBC's Bob Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. A's closer Dennis Eckersley came on to pitch the ninth to close it out for Stewart. After retiring the first two batters (Mike Scioscia and Jeff Hamilton), Eckersley's former A's teammate Mike Davis, batting for Alfredo Griffin, walked on five pitches. During Davis' at-bat, Dave Anderson initially entered the on-deck circle to hit for Alejandro Peña. Eckersley pitched carefully to Davis because the A's remembered all of the home runs he hit for the A's a year earlier, not because the light-hitting Anderson was on deck, as popularly believed. After Davis walked, Lasorda called back Anderson and sent up a hobbled Kirk Gibson to the plate, amidst cheers from the Dodger Stadium crowd. Gibson bravely fouled off Eckersley's best offerings, demonstrating how badly he was hurting. On one foul, Gibson hobbled towards first and prompted Scully to quip, \\"And it had to be an effort to run THAT far.\\" After Gibson fouled off several pitches, Davis stole second on ball three. On the next pitch, the 8th of the at-bat, Gibson, slammed a backdoor slider into the right field bleachers to win the game. The footage of Gibson hobbling around the bases on both hurt legs and pumping his fist as he rounded second became an iconic baseball film highlight. Gibson would never bat again in the Series, and his walk-off homer in Game 1 marked the first time that a World Series game ended with a come-from-behind home run. In a somewhat forgotten detail of this game highlighting the teamwork that was this Dodgers team's trademark all season, Gibson's heroics still would not have been possible without the earlier home run by the man replacing Gibson in the line-up, Mickey Hatcher. By the time Kirk Gibson reached his locker after Game 1, bullpen coach Mark Cresse had written \\"R. HOBBS\\" on a piece of paper and taped it over Gibson's nameplate, which was in reference to Gibson's heroics mirroring those of the fictional slugger played by Robert Redford in The Natural. Game 1 is the only game in World Series history such that a grand slam-hitting team both failed to win the game, and also later failed to win the series. The only other game in series history in which a grand slam-hitting team failed to win the game was 1956's Game 2 (the Yankees); nevertheless, the Yankees prevailed in the series. =Game 2= With a rested Orel Hershiser on the mound, the Dodgers took a 2–0 Series lead. Hershiser went the distance, allowing only three singles, all three hit by Dave Parker. The Dodgers got to Oakland starter Storm Davis with a five-run third. After one-out singles by Hershiser and Steve Sax, consecutive RBI singles by Franklin Stubbs and Mickey Hatcher made it 2–0 Dodgers before Mike Marshall capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Hershiser himself got an RBI when Alfredo Griffin singled in the fourth and scored on his double. Hershiser was the first pitcher to get three hits in a World Series game since Art Nehf of the New York Giants in Game 1 of the 1924 World Series. He was also the first pitcher to record a World Series RBI since Philadelphia's John Denny in Game 4 of the 1983 World Series. =Game 3= The A's got back in the series on the strength of strong pitching by former Dodger World Series hero Bob Welch and three relievers. Dodger starter John Tudor left during the second inning with tightness in his pitching shoulder and was relieved by Tim Leary who pitched the next innings and Alejandro Peña who pitched an additional three innings. The A's struck first in the third when Glenn Hubbard singled, stole second, and came home on a single by Ron Hassey. The Dodgers tied it in the fifth when Franklin Stubbs drove home Jeff Hamilton with a double. A's relievers helped squelch a Dodger threat in the sixth. Danny Heep led off with a double. John Shelby singled to left, but Heep was held up at third on the throw home as Shelby took second. Welch walked Mike Davis to load the bases, and left-hander Greg Cadaret was brought in to face lefty-hitting Mike Scioscia. Scioscia popped out to third. A's manager Tony La Russa then brought in right-hander Gene Nelson to face Hamilton, who forced Heep out at home. Alfredo Griffin grounded out to end the threat. The A's got their winning run in the bottom of the ninth when Mark McGwire deposited a one-out fastball from closer Jay Howell, who had struggled in the NLCS and also was suspended for illegally using pine tar, into the left-center field seats. Reliever Rick Honeycutt, who would later become the Dodgers' pitching coach, got the win. =Game 4= Without injured sluggers Kirk Gibson (25 HR) and Mike Marshall (20), the Dodgers started the game with what was statistically one of the weakest hitting World Series teams since the Dead-ball era. During the regular season the Game 4 starting line up of Steve Sax (2B), Franklin Stubbs (1B), Mickey Hatcher (LF), Mike Davis (RF), John Shelby (CF), Danny Heep (DH), Jeff Hamilton (3B), Mike Scioscia (C) and Alfredo Griffin (SS) combined for a total of just 36 home runs. Only Shelby had 10 or more home runs (he had exactly 10). Between them, José Canseco and Mark McGwire had hit 74 home runs for Oakland. Canseco alone had in fact hit more home runs (42) than the Dodger lineup while McGwire with 32 almost matched the Dodgers. The Dodgers got two in the first when Steve Sax walked, went to third on a Mickey Hatcher single, and scored on a passed ball by A's catcher Terry Steinbach. Hatcher scored the second run on a groundout by John Shelby. The A's got one back in their half when Luis Polonia led off with a single, went to second on a passed ball, and later scored on a José Canseco groundout. The Dodgers went up 3–1 when Franklin Stubbs doubled and scored when A's shortstop Walt Weiss couldn't field a liner by Mike Davis (the play was ruled an error.) The A's answered in the sixth on an RBI single by Carney Lansford. A key play came when the Dodgers got their final run in the seventh. With Alfredo Griffin on third and Steve Sax on first with one out, pinch- hitter Tracy Woodson hit what looked to be an inning ending double play grounder. But Lasorda called for a hit and run play so Sax was going on the pitch. Oakland tried for the double play, but Sax barely beat the throw to second. So when the throw to first beat Woodson, it was only the second out, allowing Griffin to score. The A's half of the seventh also dramatic. With one out, Weiss singled and reached second when he was called safe on a double-play grounder hit by Polonia in a similar play to the Dodgers' scoring play in the top half of the inning; Weiss was running with the pitch. Dave Henderson cut the Dodger lead to 4–3 on a two-out RBI double. After Dodgers reliever Jay Howell entered the game, José Canseco walked and Dave Parker reached on a Griffin error to load the bases, but Game 3 hero Mark McGwire popped out, stranding three and ending the inning. The A's managed to get singles in the eighth by Ron Hassey and in the ninth by Henderson, but Howell rebounded from his earlier postseason woes to stop both rallies, including striking out Canseco and inducing a foul pop out by Dave Parker in the ninth to strand the tying run at first and end the game. The Dodgers now held a commanding three games to one lead. While hosting Game 4 on NBC, Bob Costas angered many members of the Dodgers (especially manager Tommy Lasorda) by commenting before the start of the game that the Dodgers quite possibly were about to put up the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history. That comment ironically fired up the competitive spirit of the Dodgers. Later (while being interviewed by NBC's Marv Albert), after the Dodgers had won Game 4, Lasorda sarcastically suggested that the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas. =Game 5= Orel Hershiser capped one of the greatest seasons ever by a starting pitcher and one of the most improbable World Series wins in history by pitching a complete game, allowing only four hits, two runs, and striking out nine. Stan Javier had both RBIs with a single and a sac fly. In addition to Hershiser's performance, the Dodgers won because Mickey Hatcher stepped in for the hobbled Kirk Gibson in left field and provided spark, enthusiasm, and unexpected offense. He blasted his second home run in the Series off Oakland starter Storm Davis, a two-run shot, in the first inning; he had hit only one home run in the entire 1988 regular season. Mike Davis, a disappointing free- agent signing for most of the 1988 season, added a two-run blast (on a 3-0 count) in the fourth off Davis, and former World Series MVP Rick Dempsey, filling in for an injured Mike Scioscia, drove in Davis with an RBI double in the sixth. The only drama of the game briefly arose in the 8th inning: after Javier's single brought the lead to 5-2, Hershiser walked Dave Henderson to bring the tying run to the plate in the form of 42-homer man José Canseco. Hershiser got him to pop out, and struck out Dave Parker to end the threat. He struck out Tony Phillips for the final out to give the Dodgers their first World Championship since 1981. The Dodger pitching tamed Oakland monsters José Canseco (one hit, his grand slam in Game 1) and Mark McGwire (one hit and one RBI, which came in Game 3) for the entire series. The Dodgers became the first (and so far only) team to have a perfect game pitched against them and win a World Series in the same season. Tom Browning of the Cincinnati Reds pitched that perfect game on September 16, 1988. With the Lakers winning their fifth NBA championship in nine years four months before, the Dodgers winning the World Series made Los Angeles the first city to have both NBA and World Series champions in the same year. Composite line score 1988 World Series (4–1): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Oakland Athletics (A.L.) Television and radio coverage The 1988 World Series marked the last time that NBCNBC's World Series telecasts showed it's still the best at covering the national pastime would televise a World Series for seven years. Beginning in 1990, NBC would be shut out of Major League Baseball coverage completely, after CBS signed a four-year, exclusive television contract. After splitting coverage of the 1995 World Series with ABC, NBC would next cover a World Series exclusively in 1997. Longtime Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully called the Series for NBC along with Joe Garagiola; this was the last World Series that Scully would call on television (although he would subsequently call several more on CBS Radio) and the final Series broadcast on either medium for Garagiola. According to Scully (during an interview on ESPN Classic's SportsCentury profile on Dennis Eckersley), when he saw Kirk Gibson walk up to the plate, he seemed to be using his bat as a cane. When NBC returned from a commercial break at the start of the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1, Scully commented (as NBC's cameras were panning the Dodgers' dugout) that Gibson (who wasn't in the dugout at the time) wouldn't play for sure. According to Gibson, Scully's comments in large part influenced his decision to want to bat. As previously mentioned, Bob Costas, who along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pregame coverage and handled postgame interviews made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially manager Tommy Lasorda). Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history. After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a postgame interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. On the radio side, Jack Buck and Bill White provided commentary for CBS Radio. This was Buck's sixth World Series call for CBS Radio and White's fifth. It was White's last World Series as a broadcaster, as he replaced Bart Giamatti as President of the National League shortly after the World Series. As previously mentioned, he had been part of the broadcast team for a total of six World Series, four of which involved his primary employers, the New York Yankees. The Series was also broadcast by the teams' local flagship radio stations using their own announcers. In the San Francisco Bay Area, KSFO aired the games with Bill King and Lon Simmons announcing, while in Los Angeles, KABC aired the games with Ross Porter and Don Drysdale announcing. Aftermath This was the last World Series that Peter Ueberroth presided over as commissioner. Incidentally, Ueberroth rose to prominence for organizing the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Following this confrontation, both teams appeared on Family Feud with Ray Combs for a special sweeps week billed as a World Series Rematch. The Dodgers would not make another World Series appearance until 2017, where they would lose in seven games against the Houston Astros, who won their very first World Series title. The Dodgers would make another World Series appearance the following year in 2018, but lost to the Boston Red Sox in five games, marking the first time the Dodgers lost back-to-back World Series since 1977 and 1978, where they lost both World Series to the New York Yankees. The A's made it to the World Series the next two years, winning the 1989 \\"Loma Prieta earthquake\\" series 4-0 vs. the San Francisco Giants and being swept by the Cincinnati Reds 4–0 in 1990. The A's haven't appeared in the World Series since. The closest the A's have gotten to the World Series since that time was in 1992, when they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series in six games and 2006, when they lost to the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS in a four-game sweep.

Captain Cook led repeated charges against enemy barricades with a joint force of 5th Gurkhas and 72nd Highlanders. At dawn, as the Afghans fled their positions, Cook collected a few men and charged and killed a large number of enemy who were trying to rescue one of their guns before going to the aide of Major Galbraith. Cook's helmet was pierced by an enemy bullet. British Empire Website – 5th Gurkha RiflesNational Archives, London, document WO 32/7381 =Gallantry recognized= Just days after the action, Major Galbraith wrote to General Roberts a report dated 'Camp near Zabbardast Kila, 5 December 1878: Discovery Dundee – Cook Family papers Victoria Cross He was 35 years old, and a captain in the Bengal Staff Corps, British Indian Army, and 5th Gurkha Rifles during the Second Anglo-Afghan War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC: He was promoted to the rank of major on 22 November 1879, a fact announced on 16 January 1880.Weekes (2009), pp.61–62 Death in action Attached to MacPherson's Brigade on 11 December 1879, Cook participated in the attempted to attack the Afghans in the rear at Argundeh, but they were forced to fall back towards Sherpur faced by overwhelming numbers. Late in the day Cook distinguished himself in the rearguard action which saved the brigade's baggage. He fought a determined throng of Afghans shoulder to shoulder with his brother and resorted to a bayonet charge which was led by Major John Cook VC, 5th Gurkha Regiment and Lieutenant Walter Cook, 3rd Sikhs which forced the Afghans to withdraw. Unfortunately Walter Cook was shot in the chest and was carried to the Sherpur Cantonment and John Cook received a head wound. On 12 December 1879, John Cook was still able to take part in the attack next day on the That-i-Shah peak, which dominated the high ground around Kabul. During this action Major Cook received a fatal wound, being struck by a bullet that passed through the bone of his left leg below the knee. After spending the night on the hill in the open he was taken to the hospital at the besieged Sherpur, Afghanistan, but died of wounds on 19 December 1879. History of 5th Gurkha Rifles – John Cook On 21 December 1879, Major John Cook was buried in the Sherpur Cantonment British Cemetery, locally known as the 'Gora Kabar' which literally means 'White Graveyard'. He was mentioned in despatches by Frederick Roberts on 23 January 1880.

Biography William Connolly was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England c1816. No baptism record has been found for him, his birth details and the identity of his parents are unknown.Biography After working as a stableman, he enlisted as a soldier in the Honourable East India Company on 2 May 1837 at Liverpool. Later that year he sailed on the ship Exmouth to India to serve as a gunner in the Bengal Horse Artillery. He was given a medical discharge in 1859, at the age of 43 years, after 21 years and 3 months service, due to wounds received on 7 July 1857 at Jhelum during the Battle of Jhelum, British India during the Indian Mutiny. He was awarded the VC for his bravery at Jhelum. He was described as having an indifferent character. In physical appearance he was 5 feet 7 inches tall, he had brown hair, brown eyes and a fresh complexion. He returned home to England from India on the ship Alfred.British Library. Register of European Soldiers for Bengal, IOR/L/MIL/10/122.British Library. Medical Discharge Record, IOR/L/MIL/10/302.Liverpool Back in Liverpool Connolly was now an army pensioner. He lodged with Thomas and Catherine Burrows at 124 Upper Mann Street Toxteth, Liverpool in 1861 and with the Dodd family at 40 Seacombe Street Everton, Liverpool in 1881. Catherine Burrows was formerly Catherine Connolly, so she was probably a relative. Thomas and Catherine were married on 17 December 1848 at St John The Baptist church in Toxteth. Catherine's father, Michael Connolly, was a warehouseman. She was living in Mill Street Toxteth at the time of the marriage. In 1883 he gave a testimonial that was used in an advertising campaign for a universal remedy called \\"Eclectica\\": He improved his financial standing by selling his VC at auction in 1886 for £10. This was bought by Charles Winter, the newly appointed head of the Medal Department at Spink. The first sale at auction of a VC was in 1884.Auction Towards the end of his life he lived in Great Homer Street Everton and had a deposit at Great Homer Street Post Office Savings Bank. He died on 31 December 1891 of bronchitis at the Johnson family's residence at 14 Westminster Road Kirkdale, Liverpool. He was 75 years old. Mrs Johnson's daughter, Emma Catterall, was present at his passing and informed the Kirkdale Registrar, Robert Henry Webster, the next day. He was buried on 4 January 1892 in Section CE 17 Grave 220 at Kirkdale Cemetery. The mode of burial was 'Public' so the grave was unmarked. Most people were buried in 'Public' graves in those days. He made provision for his own funeral in his will and left £37 12s to his friend and doctor, Thomas Hill, of 6 Westminster Road. The solicitor involved in the probate was William Henry Quilliam.Death Most biographies of Connolly make no reference to his will and wrongly assume he died in poverty. Some authors suggest that William Connelly, labourer, aged 73 years, residing at Walton Workhouse in 1891 was William Connolly VC. This man was probably William Connell who died at Walton Workhouse aged 74 years and was buried at St Mary's Bootle on 24 February 1893.

He has works in the repertoire of such high-profile musicians as Evelyn Glennie, Michael Houstoun, Michael Brecker, Joshua Redman and the New Juilliard Ensemble, and is one of New Zealand's most frequently performed composers. He has established an international profile and receives regular commissions from organisations in New Zealand and overseas. The son of Greek immigrant parents, Psathas grew up in Taumarunui and then Napier. He attended Napier Boys' High School and left early to study composition and piano at Victoria University of Wellington. He supported himself as a student partly by playing up to nine gigs a week in a jazz trio. Psathas studied further with composer Jacqueline Fontyn in Belgium before returning to New Zealand, where he has since lectured in music at Victoria University and continued to fulfill a busy schedule of commissions. Early success came with Matre's Dance in 1991, a maximum-energy duet for percussion and piano that has since made Psathas' name international through having been taken up and championed by percussionist Evelyn Glennie. This work and Drum Dances are fast becoming standard repertoire for percussionists throughout the world. According to his publisher Promethean Editions, a new work by John Psathas is an individual, unique entity, and his music is like that of no one else. His 'sound' is difficult to define – the harmony and improvisational feel of jazz, the compelling rhythmic drive and excitement of rock music and the sustained repetitive textures of minimalism are apparent as influences, yet they combine and intermingle with something else more intangible. This undefinable quality is partly what makes his one of the most original voices in the arena of contemporary classical music in New Zealand. Psathas' relationship with Evelyn Glennie has been a particularly fruitful one for them both. Her performing repertoire includes Matre's Dance, Drum Dances, Spike, Happy Tachyons and the double concerto for piano and percussion View From Olympus. She has recorded Matre's Dance on her CDs Drumming and Greatest Hits (BMG), and she continues to commission new works. A highlight of 2000 was the premiere of the Omnifenix at an outdoor concert before an audience of 8000 people at the 2 Agosto Festival in Bologna, Italy. This work was tailored to the particular improvising talents of tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker. A retrospective concert of Psathas' chamber music was given in the 2000 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, culminating with the premiere of the specially commissioned Piano Quintet. In the programme to the concert, he described the process of creating his music: \\"When I write music, it's not a sense of inventing I experience, as much as it is a sense of finding something that exists at the remote periphery of what I know. It is like seeing things – that aren't really there – in the corner of one's eye, but not spinning around to view them, because then they would simply cease to be. It is a case of being aware of a thing in one's peripheral vision and, while staring straight ahead, trying to decipher, without looking at it, the true nature of what it is. What one is finding is exactly the right thing for any given moment in a musical work.\\"  Career highlights  Highlights in 2002 included the premieres of several major works, including View From Olympus a double concerto for piano, percussion and orchestra performed by Evelyn Glennie, Philip Smith and the Halle Orchestra conducted by Mark Elder at the Royal Gala finale of the Commonwealth Games 'Pulse' music festival in Manchester, UK. This work was awarded New Zealand's major annual composition award for 2002, the SOUNZ Contemporary Award. In 2003 a new CD of chamber works, Fragments, was released to critical acclaim and went on to win the Tui Award for Best Classical Recording at the New Zealand Music Awards. He was also named as the recipient of one of five Arts Foundation of New Zealand Artist Laureate Awards, which carry cash prizes of $40,000. In 2004 Psathas achieved the largest audience for New Zealand-composed music when billions heard his fanfares and other music at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Athens Olympics. This high-profile work was recognised in New Zealand's New Year Honours by his appointment as an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Additionally, his Piano Concerto, premiered by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and soloist Stephen Gosling, was awarded the SOUNZ Contemporary Award for excellence in composition. In 2007, Psathas' album, View from Olympus, won the Best Classical Album award in the New Zealand Music Awards.

The 94th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion San Diego Padres. The Yankees swept the Padres in four games to win their second World Series championship in three years and their 24th overall. Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, three games to none, and then the Cleveland Indians in the AL Championship Series, four games to two. The Padres advanced to the series by defeating the Houston Astros in the NL Division Series, three games to one, and then the Atlanta Braves in the NL Championship Series, four games to two. It was the Yankees' second appearance in the World Series in three years, and San Diego's second World Series appearance overall, their first since losing in . This was officially the first World Series that Bud Selig presided over as Commissioner of Baseball, although he had presided over the Commissioner's Trophy presentation at the end of the and 1997 World Series as the interim Commissioner. For the first time, the same city—San Diego—hosted both the final World Series game and the Super Bowl the same year; not only were they held in the same city, they were both also held in the same stadium, Qualcomm Stadium. Summary Matchups =Game 1= In Game 1, Kevin Brown took the hill for the Padres while the Yankees sent ALCS MVP David Wells to start. The Yankees began the scoring in the second inning, when rookie Ricky Ledee laced a two-run double into the right field corner with the bases loaded. However, the Padres battered Wells hard, beginning in the third inning when Greg Vaughn homered to right-center with a man aboard tying the game up at two runs apiece. In the fifth, Tony Gwynn smashed a two-run shot off the facing of the upper deck, followed up immediately by Vaughn's second dinger of the night. Trailing 5–2, Jorge Posada singled and Ledee walked with one out in the seventh for the Yankees, ending the night for Brown. Chuck Knoblauch homered off of Donne Wall to tie the game at five. After Derek Jeter singled, Mark Langston relieved Wall and after Paul O'Neill flied out, walked two to load the bases. A 2–2 count call by home plate umpire Rich Garcia would prove to be decisive. Langston's pitch was shown to be borderline and Garcia called it a ball. On the next pitch, Tino Martinez sent a grand slam into the upper deck, giving the Yankees a 9–5 lead. The Padres would score one more run in the eighth off of Mariano Rivera with the run charged to Jeff Nelson, but Rivera then pitched a scoreless ninth as the Yankees won Game 1 9–6. =Game 2= In Game 2, the Bombers would go up 2–0 in the Series thanks to a dreadful outing by San Diego starter Andy Ashby. Catcher Greg Meyers, starting for the first time in a month, was also ineffective. Chuck Knoblauch walked to lead off the first, stole second, and scored on third basemen Ken Caminiti's throwing error to first on Paul O'Neill's ground ball. After Bernie Williams grounded out, RBI singles by Chili Davis and Scott Brosius gave the Yankees a 3–0 lead. Next inning, Derek Jeter drove in Knoblauch with a single, then Williams's home run made it 6–0 Yankees. They added to their lead in the fourth on Ricky Ledee's RBI double. New York started Cuban import Orlando Hernández, who pitched four shutout innings before allowing a two-out triple to Chris Gomez in the fifth. innings Gomez scored on Quilvio Veras's double to put the Padres on the board, but In the bottom of the inning, Jorge Posada's two-run home run off of Brian Boehringer extended the Yankees' lead to 9–1. Mike Stanton relieved Hernandez in the eighth inning and allowed a leadoff double to Caminiti, who scored two outs later on Ruben Rivera's double. After Carlos Hernandez singled, Jeff Nelson relieved Stanton and allowed an RBI single to Mark Sweeney before striking out Veras to end the inning. Nelson then pitched a perfect ninth as the Yankees 9–3 win gave them a 2–0 series lead. =Game 3= The Yankees sent David Cone to the mound to face former Yankee pitcher Sterling Hitchcock, the MVP of the NLCS. Both teams were kept off the scoreboard until the bottom of the sixth inning when Hitchcock himself led off the inning with a single off Cone. He and Qulivio Veras both scored two batters later when Tony Gwynn shot a single down the line past Tino Martinez at first base and Paul O'Neill committed a throwing error on the same play. Gwynn would also score in the inning to give San Diego a 3–0 lead. However, a half inning later the Yanks jumped on Hitchcock for two runs, beginning with a home run to left-center by Scott Brosius. The second run came in after Shane Spencer doubled and scored on an error by Ken Caminiti. In the eighth, the call was made to Trevor Hoffman after Randy Myers walked O'Neill to open the inning. Hoffman then walked Tino Martinez before Scott Brosius tagged a three-run blast over the fence in dead center. A Greg Vaughn sacrifice fly, scoring Quilvio Veras, cut the lead to 5–4 coming into the ninth, but the Yankees wrapped up the victory when Mariano Rivera picked up the save to end it. There was some criticism of Padres manager Bruce Bochy for using John Vander Wal as a pinch runner, leaving the responsibility of facing Rivera for the final at bat to Andy Sheets. Sheets struck out to end the game. =Game 4= Andy Pettitte, who struggled throughout the regular season and had turned in a poor start in the ALCS, outdueled Kevin Brown in Game 4, throwing shutout innings. The Yankees scored their first run of the game in the sixth inning on Bernie Williams's RBI groundout with runners on second and third, then added to their lead in the eighth on Scott Brosius's based-loaded RBI single followed by Ricky Ledee's sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the inning, however, the Padres were able to get two batters on base against Pettitte. Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson struck out Greg Vaughn; then called upon Mariano Rivera. After Ken Caminiti reached with a single to load the bases, Rivera was able to get Jim Leyritz, known for his clutch postseason home runs, to fly out to end the threat. Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth inning to end the Series. Composite box 1998 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over San Diego Padres (N.L.) Broadcasting The television rights for the 1998 World Series went to Fox, as they had the rights to the World Series in even-numbered years under the television contract that was signed in 1996. Joe Buck once again provided the play-by-play, with Tim McCarver and Bob Brenly alongside him in the booth. For the first time, ESPN Radio was the home of the World Series, having taken the national radio rights for Major League Baseball from CBS Radio. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan provided the coverage for the network. Impact and aftermath =Yankees= The series win brought the Yankees' franchise championship total to 24, tying the Montreal Canadiens for most championships won by a North American professional sports franchise. The 1998 Yankees are considered to be one of the top teams in baseball history. With the win, the Yankees posted an MLB record with the most overall wins in a single season in MLB history with 125 wins (including the postseason). The previous record for most overall wins in one season was 118, set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs followed by 116, set by their cross-town rivals, the 1986 New York Mets. The sweep marked the first time the Yankees swept a World Series since when they swept the Philadelphia Phillies. They were also the first team to sweep a World Series since the Cincinnati Reds in . This was also the first time since that a team had won a World Series after having the best record in the regular season. It was also the first time since that a team won a World Series after posting at least 100 wins in the regular season. It was also the only World Series championship during the Yankees' 1990s dynasty not to be won against either the Mets or the Atlanta Braves. On October 11, 2005, A&E; Home Video released The New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001) DVD set. Game 3 of the 1998 World Series is included in the set. =Padres= The loss made the Padres the first expansion team to lose two World Series, having lost in to the Detroit Tigers. In addition, the Padres became the first expansion team to lose a World Series at home. As of 2012 the Padres are one of only two teams in Major League Baseball to win at least two league championships and never win the World Series (the other team being the Texas Rangers). Bruce Bochy is the only Padres player or manager to be on every Padres playoff team. Bruce Bochy however would go on to win three World Series titles as manager of the San Francisco Giants in 2010, 2012 and 2014. As of 2019, this remains as the most recent championship game or series a professional San Diego sports team has participated in. The Padres' loss was also significant as it also assured that the city of San Diego's sporting championship drought since 1963 would continue, which has become the longest streak of such futility for a city with at least one professional sports team.Thirteen years after missing a Super Bowl-winning field – 07.12.04 – SI Vault The Padres left Qualcomm Stadium for Petco Park for the 2004 baseball season.

An NCO was wounded and a medical officer who went to his aid was also wounded. Second Lieutenant Craig went out at once and got the NCO under cover, but while taking the medical officer to shelter was himself wounded. Nevertheless, the rescue was effected, and he then scooped cover for the wounded, thus saving their lives. Craig served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Kaikoura to English immigrants, Cooke became a carpenter after finishing school. He moved to Australia in 1912, taking his young family with him, and settled in Melbourne. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1915. After training he embarked for the Middle East and on arrival was posted to 8th Battalion. Soon his battalion was serving in the Somme sector on the Western Front. He fought in the Battle of Pozières during which he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions in staying at his post in the face of a German attack. Early life Cooke was born in Kaikoura, in the Marlborough District of New Zealand, on 5 July 1881, to an Englishman, Tom Cooke, and his wife Caroline (). Educated at Kaikoura District High School, the family later moved to Wellington where Cooke became a carpenter like his father. He also played the cornet and was part of a band. In 1902, he married Maud Elizabeth Elliott and the couple had three children, two girls and a boy. In June 1912, he moved his young family to Australia and settled in the suburb of Richmond, in Melbourne, where he worked as a builder. First World War In February 1915, Cooke enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service abroad in the First World War. He was posted to the 24th Battalion as a reinforcement upon completion of his training at Broadmeadows and embarked for the Middle East aboard the HMAT Commonwealth. His posting proved relatively short-lived for after he arrived in the Middle East, he was transferred to 8th Battalion. The 8th Battalion, as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Australian Division, arrived on the Western Front in April 1916 and was initially stationed in the Fleurbaix and then the Messines sectors. By this time Cooke had reverted to his original rank of private, having spent a period of time as an acting corporal. As part of the 1st Division, in mid-July, it was moved to the Somme sector for the upcoming Somme Offensive. On 24 July 1916, the battalion entered the Battle of Pozières. On 25 July, it was seeking to consolidate the Australian positions around Pozières. Cooke, operating a Lewis gun, was sent forward with his assistants to stabilise an unsafe section of the line. He and his companions secured the area but was exposed to long range machine-gun fire which soon accounted for all but Cooke. Even after running out of ammunition, he continued to man his post in the face of a German counterattack during which he was killed. The battalion was withdrawn from the front lines two days later, having incurred 347 casualties. Cooke was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions of 25 July. At the time, the VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The award of the VC to Cooke was gazetted on 9 September 1916 and the citation read as follows: The Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, on which Cooke's name is recorded Cooke's wife was unaware of the award of the VC to her husband until reading of it in newspaper reports. The medal was eventually presented to her by Arthur Foljambe, the Governor-General of New Zealand, in a ceremony at Government House in Wellington on 31 January 1917. His wife, who had returned to Wellington at the time of Cooke's enlistment in the AIF, later remarried. Cooke has no known grave and his name is recorded on the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial and also on the war memorial in his town of birth, Kaikoura. Medals and legacy Cooke's medals, which in addition to the VC included the British War Medal and Victory Medal, are displayed at the National Army Museum at Waiouru in New Zealand. In 2010, a newly built barracks building at the Linton Military Camp was named for Cooke; several of his descendants were present at the opening ceremony.

The 95th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves in a rematch of the 1996 World Series, in which the Yankees prevailed. The Yankees swept the 1999 Series in four games for their second consecutive title, third in four years, and 25th overall. It was the Yankees' third straight defeat of the Braves franchise in the Fall Classic (having beaten the Milwaukee Braves in the 1958 World Series in addition to their 1996 victory over the Atlanta Braves). Yankees closer Mariano Rivera was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, three games to zero, and then the Boston Red Sox in the AL Championship Series, four games to one. The Braves advanced to the series by defeating the Houston Astros in the NL Division Series, three games to one, and then the New York Mets in the NL Championship Series, four games to two. The 1999 Series is remembered for Chad Curtis's walk-off home run in Game 3, which gave the Yankees a 6–5 victory, and Game 2's infamous interview of Pete Rose by Jim Gray on NBC. This was the first World Series to feature both number-one seeds from the AL and NL, which would not repeat again until 2013 and again in 2020. Background This featured a rematch of the 1996 World Series. It would also be the last World Series until 2013 in which the two teams with the best regular-season records in their respective leagues would face off. Perhaps most significantly, it was the first World Series ever in which the competing teams had played each other in the regular season. Although interleague play had begun in , neither the nor series saw a rematch from the regular season. The 1999 World Series also feted the All-Century Team, featuring the greatest players of the 20th century as voted by both fans and sportswriters. One of the players on the All-Century Team, Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio, had died in March of that year, causing the Yankees to honor him by wearing a black #5 on their sleeves. Summary Matchups =Game 1= The 1999 series opened with Greg Maddux facing Orlando Hernández in Game 1, becoming the latest a World Series has ever begun (October 23) beating the previous record by 2 days (1995 World Series, October 21). The Braves got on the board first in the series when Chipper Jones launched a home run down the right field line in the fourth inning. That would be the only hit that El Duque would allow through seven innings while striking out ten Atlanta batters. It would also be the only home run by the Braves in the series. Maddux had pitched scoreless three-hit ball through seven before running into major trouble in the eighth, which began when Scott Brosius singled for the third time in the game. Pinch hitter Darryl Strawberry walked and Chuck Knoblauch reached when Braves first baseman Brian Hunter mishandled his sacrifice bunt attempt. Derek Jeter stroked a single into left with the bases loaded driving in a run. With still nobody out and the bases juiced, Atlanta reliever John Rocker gave up a two-run single to Paul O'Neill through the right side making it 3–1 Yankees. Later in the inning, Rocker walked Jim Leyritz with the bases loaded to force home another run. Mariano Rivera picked up the save to wrap up the 4–1 victory. =Game 2= Game 2 featured the presentation of the All-Century team and an explosion of Yankees runs off Atlanta starter Kevin Millwood. In the first inning, Knoblauch, Jeter, and O'Neill opened the game with singles with O'Neill driving in Knoblauch. After a double-play groundout, both Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius drove in a run with singles each to give the Yankees a 3–0 lead in the first. In the third, Bernie Williams and Martinez hit leadoff singles before the former scored on Ricky Ledee's double. Terry Mulholland relieved starter Kevin Millwood and after getting two outs, shortstop Ozzie Guillén's error on David Cone's ground ball allowed Martinez to score. The Yankees added to their lead off of Mulholland on Martinez's groundout that scored Jeter in the fourth, who led off the inning with a double, and Knoblauch's single in the fifth that scored Brosius, who also doubled to lead off the inning. Cone shutout the Braves for seven innings while Ramiro Mendoza pitched a scoreless eighth, but in the ninth inning, allowed a leadoff single to Chipper Jones. After a two-out walk, Jones scored on Greg Myers's single. Jeff Nelson relieved Mendoza and allowed an RBI double to Bret Boone before getting Otis Nixon to ground out to end the game and give the Yankees a 2-0 series lead. This was the last victory of a World Series Game 2 on the road until the Texas Rangers won Game 2 of the 2011 World Series in St. Louis. Golfer Payne Stewart, a good friend of Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, died between Games 2 and 3. Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill's father died a few hours before Game 4. =Game 3= Game 3 in New York matched up lefties Andy Pettitte and Tom Glavine, who had been scheduled to start Game 1 but was scratched and moved back to Game 3 due to a stomach virus. Pettitte was rocked early. Bret Boone drove in Gerald Williams with a RBI double in the first. The Yankees tied the game in bottom of the inning on Paul O'Neill's RBI single, but in the third, Brian Jordan had an RBI single scoring Boone, and Jose Hernandez doubled in Jordan and Andruw Jones. In the fourth inning, Bret Boone doubled in Gerald Williams for a second time in the game to make the score 5–1. He then was called out trying to steal third. Replays appeared to show that he slid in just ahead of the tag, and this call likely cost the Braves a run, as Chipper Jones doubled two pitches later. Glavine was sharp through seven innings but gave up homers to Tino Martinez in the fifth and Chad Curtis, trimming the Braves lead to 5–3. The Yankees bullpen was solid, holding the Braves scoreless after Pettitte left the game. In the eighth, a tiring Glavine surrendered a two-run homer to Knoblauch to tie up the game at 5–5. There had been question as to whether to leave Glavine in for that inning. He had only thrown 72 pitches, but said later that he felt like his body was tiring coming off the illness that sidelined him from his scheduled Game 1 start, and felt hesitant to go back out but said he would try for one more inning. Glavine would be replaced by John Rocker who shut out the Yankees until he was relieved after the ninth. The score remained knotted until the bottom of the tenth when Chad Curtis blasted a walk-off home run—his second home run of the game—off Mike Remlinger, giving the Yankees a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series. =Game 4= Game 4 featured the presentation of the Roberto Clemente Award to Tony Gwynn, followed by a battle of hard-throwing Cy Young Award winners, Roger Clemens and John Smoltz. In the third inning, the Yanks broke through when Tino Martinez singled off Ryan Klesko's foot with the bases loaded, driving in two runs. Jorge Posada followed with another RBI single, making the score 3–0. Clemens, seeking his first World Series victory, was outstanding, the only Braves scoring coming in the eighth when Boone singled in Walt Weiss. Jim Leyritz added another Yankees run with a shot in the eighth, adding to his legacy as a great postseason performer and as one of the thorns in the side of Braves fans. Rivera, who was named Series MVP, got Keith Lockhart to fly out to LF Curtis for the final out of the season. The 1999 New York Yankees became the first team to win the World Series in consecutive sweeps since the 1938–1939 Yankees. It was the first sweep by a team without home-field advantage since when Baltimore swept the Dodgers. The Yankees' 11–1 postseason record was the best ever, tied by the Chicago White Sox in . The Yankees players were each paid $326,000 for this World Championship. With the Yankees' sweep of the Braves, this was the second time in 1999 that a New York City team had swept a team from Atlanta out of a playoffs; the Knicks had swept the Hawks in the second round of the NBA Playoffs during their Cinderella run to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs. It would also mark the final time the Yankees clinched the championship at the old Yankee Stadium. The powerhouse Braves batted just .200 in the 4-game Series. Composite box 1999 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) beat Atlanta Braves (N.L.). Aftermath This was the fifth World Series appearance in the 1990s for Atlanta, but the new decade would not be as favorable to them. To date, the 1999 World Series is the Braves' last Fall Classic. The Yankees would continue their dynasty by defeating the New York Mets in the next year's World Series. They won a fourth straight pennant in 2001, but they lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in that season's World Series. They would reach the World Series again in 2003 (losing to the Florida Marlins) and 2009 (defeating the defending champions, the Philadelphia Phillies). On October 11, 2005, A&E; Home Video released the New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001) DVD set. Game 3 of the 1999 World Series is included in the set. Media coverage This was NBC's 39th and final World Series telecast to date, as Fox would air the next World Series as part of the contract in place, and acquired the exclusive broadcast rights of Major League Baseball beginning in 2001. Bob Costas provided play-by-play while Joe Morgan served as analyst for the series. Hannah Storm served as pre- game host with Barry Larkin serving as the analyst. The field reporters were Jim Gray (Yankees dugout) and Craig Sager (Braves dugout) on loan from Turner Sports. With the Knicks having played in the NBA Finals in June, this was the second championship series in 1999 that NBC broadcast involving teams from New York. Bob Costas, Jim Gray, and Hannah Storm were involved both times: Costas with play-by-play, Gray as a reporter, and Storm as pre-game host. This was the most recent year that a city hosted both the NBA Finals and the World Series in the same year, until Cleveland did so in 2016. Once again, ESPN Radio provided coverage of the World Series. Play-by-play man Jon Miller was joined in the booth by Rick Sutcliffe, who substituted for the unavailable Joe Morgan.

Background William Cosgrove was born at Aghada, County Cork on 1 October 1888, the son of Michael and Mary Cosgrove. He had four brothers, Dan, Ned, David, Joseph and a sister Mary-Catherine. While they were still young their father emigrated to Australia, but later returned. In the meantime his wife moved with her children to a cottage in nearby Peafield, and the children attended school at the National School, Ballinrostig. William began work at as an apprentice butcher at Whitegate, and one of his daily chores was a morning delivery to Fort Carlisle (now Fort Davis) with a consignment of meat for the troops. It was from Fort Carlisle that he joined the army. Army and WWI William Cosgrove enlisted in the Royal Munster Fusiliers on 24 March 1909 and was given the regimental number 8980. At the outbreak of war the 1st Battalion of the Munster Fusiliers was stationed in Rangoon, Burma, as regular battalions were routinely stationed overseas. They left Rangoon on 21 November 1914, and William Cosgrove (now Corporal) landed in England on 10 January 1915. Upon landing they still wore their Indian issue uniforms and stood on the cold quay in their khaki drill shorts. The battalion was then assigned to the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division (United Kingdom), in preparation for the landings at the Dardanelles. Gallipoli The 1st Munsters, together with the 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers and Hampshire Regiment, were on the converted collier ‘River Clyde’ when it ran ashore for the Cape Helles 'V’ beach landing on 25 April 1915 at 06.20 am. On departing from the ship's bay they were subject to fierce enfilading machine gun fire from hidden Turkish defences. One hundred or more of the Battalion's men fell at this stage of the battle, and those who managed to get ashore could not advance due to the withering Turkish fire. On the following day it was decided to destroy the wire entanglements facing the men, as the naval bombardment had failed to do so. It was during this attack that Corporal Cosgrove 1st RMF, performed the action that was to earn him the regiment's first Victoria Cross of the war. The action was described by Cosgrove himself: He was also wounded during this action. Promoted to Sergeant, he saw no further action due to his wound, which was a contributing factor in his death later on. VC award citation The award of the V.C. was gazette on 23 August 1915. It stated that it was awarded: On 26 April 1915, the second day of the disastrous V beach landing at Cape Helles, during the Battle of Gallipoli, Turkey, when just three companies of Munsters had made it to the shelter of some dunes, at daybreak they charged to take the village behind the Sedd el Bahr fort overlooking the bay. Corporal Cosgrove led a company section during the attack on the Turkish positions.

He is a three-time Olympic gold medalist. He holds the record for the most X-Games gold medals and most Olympic gold medals by a snowboarder, and has won 10 ESPY Awards. Early life White was born in San Diego, California. His ancestry includes Irish and Italian. He was born with a Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect for which he endured two open-heart operations before the age of one.Official Site of Shaun White White spent his formative years riding Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain, small ski resorts found in Ludlow, Vermont, and the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California. Career White quickly drew the eyes of many in the skateboarder scene, including professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. Hawk befriended the nine-year-old White at a local skatepark and mentored him, helping him turn pro in skateboarding at the age of 17. White has won many titles on his skateboard, including the overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion, and was the first person to compete in and win both the Summer and Winter X Games in two different sports. =Snowboarding career= Following in his older brother Jesse White's footsteps, White switched from skiing to snowboarding at age six, and by age seven he received his first sponsorship. White has participated in four Winter Olympics in his career. At the 2006, 2010, and 2018 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the snowboard halfpipe event. White has also participated in the Winter X Games, where he has won a medal every year since 2002. Including all winter X Games competitions through 2013, his medal count stands at 18 (13 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze), among which is the first quadruple win streak by a male athlete in one discipline, the snowboard slopestyle. White's streak was snapped in 2007 when he lost to Andreas Wiig and Teddy Flandreau, with White taking the bronze. He won the Air & Style Contest in 2003 and 2004. 2006 Winter Olympics At the 2006 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the half-pipe. After his first run in qualifications, White was almost out of competition, scoring only 37.7. On his second run, he recorded a score of 45.3. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 (50 is the highest possible score) to win. Fellow American Danny Kass won the silver with a points total of 44.0. 2008 Executing a near-flawless second run, White captured his third consecutive snowboard halfpipe title at the 2008 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships to go along with his third US Open slopestyle competition. This followed White's win at the 25th (2007) Burton US Open, where he placed third in slopestlyle and first in the halfpipe. At the 2007 Open, White was also crowned the first \\"Burton Global Open Champion\\". His take for the event was $100,000 (Global Open Champ), $20,000 (1st Place Halfpipe), $90,000 (3rd Place Slopestyle), and a new Corvette. On November 16, 2008, White released his first video game Shaun White Snowboarding in North America (November 14, 2008, in Europe). Shaun White Snowboarding was the 20th best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States. 2009 White with Richard Branson in 2009 There was a lot of controversy over who won the 2009 SuperPipe at Winter X Games XIII. Kevin Pearce had 5 hits in the pipe, and all were the same tricks White did in his final run. White, on the other hand, had 6 hits and he started off his run with a big backside rodeo 540 where Pearce started his run off with a big grab. Although Pearce went bigger, he had only 5 hits, and his first hit wasn't as technical as White's first hit. Judges came to the conclusion that White deserved the better score because he started off with a more technical trick and he had 1 more hit than Pearce. With the win, White became the second competitor, after Tanner Hall, to win a gold medal in the SuperPipe in consecutive years at the Winter X Games. He also won a gold medal in Slopestyle, finally winning gold after 2 straight years of bronze. On February 14, 2009, White won the FIS World Cup Men's Halfpipe event at Vancouver's Cypress Mountain. Out of the gate in his first qualifying run, he qualified immediately with the day's best score of 45.5. With a thumb sprained on an over-rotated backside 1080 in the second qualifying run, he clinched the event with the first of his two runs in the finals. His first finals run was awarded the highest score ever in FIS halfpipe, a 47.3. 2010 Winter Olympics At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, White again won gold in the halfpipe. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 on his first run, which proved a high enough score to secure the gold medal without a second run. He performed his second run anyway, as a victory lap, ending his run with a well-anticipated Double McTwist 1260 which he named The Tomahawk. This second run resulted in a record score of 48.4 (50 is the highest possible score) enlarging his margin of victory. His nearest competitor won the silver with a points total of 45.0, 3.4 behind White. 2011 After a sub-par performance in the Slopestyle, failing to reach the finals, White \\"redeemed\\" himself in the SuperPipe. With an 89, he sat in second place going into his 2nd of three runs. He completed the run, landing his infamous Double McTwist 1260 and finishing with a score of 97.33 to take the lead and claim the historical 4th straight Gold in the Winter X Games, held in Aspen Colorado. The score tied an X Games record which was set by White one year before. His 3rd run was a simple victory run featuring mostly straight air. 2012 At Winter X, White became the first person in the history of the Winter X Games to score a perfect 100 in the men's Snowboard SuperPipe. 2013 White won his 6th consecutive SuperPipe victory, making him the second participant ever to achieve this, with SnoCross racer Tucker Hibbert achieving his 6th consecutive victory earlier in the same day. In December 2013, he won the third place in the Pipe & Slope contest at the FIS Snowboard World Cup in Copper Mountain, Colorado. 2014 Winter Olympics White finished fourth at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Halfpipe event. During the winter games, he was the most talked-about Olympic athlete on Facebook. 2018 Winter Olympics White after medalling at the 2018 Winter Olympics While in New Zealand, training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, White crashed into the edge of a superpipe; the resulting injuries to his face required 62 stitches. Despite the accident, White qualified for the 2018 US Olympic Team. On February 14, he won his third Olympic gold medal for the Men's Halfpipe event with a score of 97.75, with Ayumu Hirano of Japan taking the silver medal and Scott James of Australia taking the bronze. White was trailing Hirano by one full point coming into his last run with a score of 94.25. Despite this, White dramatically won the gold medal with back-to-back 1440s.

Life Gunn was born in Neston, Cheshire. He was educated at Sedbergh School and Mostyn House. He was 29 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, British Army during World War II when the action took place for which he was awarded the VC. During the British attempt to relieve the siege of Tobruk, the Germans counter-attacked near the airfield of Sidi Rezegh. On 21 November 1941 at Sidi Rezegh, Gunn was the commander of A Troop of J Battery. These four QF 2 pounder anti-tank guns mounted porteeWhen a gun was loaded onto the back of a truck and fired from there instead of on the ground, it was described as en portee. on trucks were part of a battery of twelve guns attached to the Rifle Brigade. An attack earlier in the day was driven off but the main attack was by 60 German tanks. Gunn - in an unarmoured vehicle - drove between the guns under his command, encouraging and reorganising them as the battle progressed. Three guns had been knocked out and their crews fatally wounded when the last was hit. Except the sergeant, the crew were dead or disabled and the vehicle set alight. The battery commander Major Pinney attacked the flames and Gunn crossed the enemy fire to join him. Gunn took over the gun aiming and firing it with the sergeant acting as his loader. Despite enemy fire and the danger of the flames exploding the ammunition with which the portee was loaded, Gunn fired 40- 50 rounds from the QF 2 pounder gun and set two enemy tanks on fire before he himself was killed by being shot through the head. After he was killed, the battery commander took over the gun and continued the action. As a result of the battery's actions, it was given the honour title \\"Sidi Rezegh\\". The official announcement in the London Gazette of the award said of him \\"Second-Lieutenant Gunn showed the most conspicuous courage in attacking this large number of enemy tanks with a single unarmoured gun, and his utter disregard for extreme danger was an example which inspired all who saw it. He remained undismayed by intense fire and overwhelming odds, and his gallant resistance only ceased with his death. But for this very gallant action the enemy tanks would undoubtedly have over-run our position.\\" A memorial to Gunn stands in his old school, Sedbergh, and at Mostyn House commemorating his brave deeds. A street was named in his honour in Neston (\\"Gunn Grove\\"), a JLRRA training troop was created in his name (Gunn Troop 33 Campbell Battery RA) and a memorial was placed in the Parish Church, (St Mary & St Helen's).http://www.carlscam.com/warmem/gunn.htm The medal His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum in Woolwich, England.

Enlistment and training Curtis was born on 7 March 1891 in St Anthony-in-Roseland, Cornwall. He enlisted after war broke out in August 1914, and passed fit for duty on 12 September. He was attested into The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI) at Bodmin on 14 September as No.15833 Private Curtis. However, four days later he was transferred to the 7th Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Recruiting in Ireland in August 1914 was not as satisfactory as in Britain, and in consequence Lord Kitchener decided early in September to transfer a number of recruits for whom no room could be found in English regiments to fill up the ranks of the 10th Division. Despite these transferees, the division and its battalions consisted of Irishmen (apart from the 10th Battalion Hampshire Regiment) The 7th Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers had just started forming up in August at Naas in Ireland, and presumably Horace proceeded there to commence his training at the Curragh in County Kildare. The 30th Brigade moved to Dublin in February 1915 and then embarked for England in May 1915 and onto the Basingstoke area, where intensive training of the 10th Division took place for the next 3 months. During that time, the division was inspected by King George V on 28 May at Hackwood Park and by Field Marshal, Lord Kitchener on 1 June. As a result of these inspections the following divisional orders were issued: > \\"Lieutenant-General Sir B Mahon received His Majesty's command to publish a > divisional order to say how pleased His Majesty was to have had an > opportunity of seeing the 10th Irish Division and how impressed he was with > the appearance and physical fitness of the troops. His Majesty, the King > recognises that it is due to the keenness and co-operation of all ranks that > the 10th Division has reached such a high standard of efficiency. The > General Officer Commanding 10th Irish Division has much pleasure in > informing the troops that Field-Marshal Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, the > Secretary of State for War, expressed himself as highly satisfied with all > he saw of the 10th Division at the inspection today.\\" Order no. 34 1st June > 1915. Gallipoli The division embarked from Devonport on 11 July 1915, the 7th battalion R. D Fus aboard H. M. T Alaunia and via Malta and Alexandria, the 7th landed at the island of Mytilene off the Turkish coast on 25 July 1915. Horace's service with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (M. E. F) dated from 10 July 1915. The battalion left Mytilene and landed at Suvla Bay, Gallipoli peninsula, Turkey on 7 August 1915. Other parts of the division had been engaged with the enemy prior to the 7th Battalion arriving and had suffered severe losses, which was also to befall the 7th Battalion. In his book \\"The Tenth Division in Gallipoli\\" Major Bryan Cooper, who served with the division, estimates that by the end of the Gallipoli campaign, the Tenth Division had lost 75% of its original strength killed or wounded. In his book \\"Ireland's Forgotten 10th\\" Capt. Jeremy Stanley states 3,000 men were killed or died from wounds, 25% of the division's strength. Greece After Gallipoli, the 10th Division sailed for the base island of Lemnos (Mudros Harbour) on 30 September and in early October left for the port of Salonica in Greece. During a long stay in the Macedonian theatre of war and bitter fighting, Horace earned promotion during 1916 from unpaid lance corporal on 7 February to full sergeant on 17 November 1916. He was also mentioned in Dispatches in the London Gazette on 21 July 1917. Palestine After almost 2 years here, the division sailed for Alexandria in September 1917 for Egypt and the allied offensive against the Turks in Palestine. A further 8 months later in April 1918, the 6th Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers and the 7th Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers had left the 30th Brigade, 10th Division and returned to Egypt in order to join units in France fighting the German advance. France On 23 May 1918, the 7th Battalion left Alexandria and landed at Marsailles, France on 31 May. On 6 June the battalion was reduced to a cadre. Surplus personnel, of whom Horace was one, were absorbed by the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers. This was to be the fourth theatre of war that Curtis fought in: he had served with the M. E. F and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. He was now a member of the British Expeditionary Force (B. E. F) France and Belgium. On 20 June 1918, Curtis returned to England where he went to Bermondsley Military Hospital in London for treatment for malaria, broken by a furlough, home leave to Fiddlers Green between 24 July until 3 August, the first time in four years. He was finally cleared to return to his unit in France on 19 August and was back in France by 1 September and to the Front by 21 September. VC action On 18 October 1918, No. 14107 Sergeant Horace A Curtis, 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers fought in action near Le Cateau that earned him the Victoria Cross. The following is the official citation, which appeared in the London Gazette on 6 January 1919. His VC was presented to him by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 8 March 1919. Post war On 31 January 1919 he was back home and starting 28 days demobilisation leave and transferred to Class \\"Z\\" Army reserve on 23 March 1919. Curtis was finally discharged on 31 March 1920. He joined the 5th (Territorial) Battalion DCLI on a 3-year engagement at St Columb on 5 May 1920. Private 5431368, he was rapidly promoted to Sergeant and by 27 August 1920 was WO2 (CSM). On 20 December 1921, Horace transferred to the 4/5th DCLI and on 19 May 1923 his service was terminated at the end of his engagement. Curtis died on 1 July 1968.

During the Second Boer War, while serving with the Imperial Light Horse, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1902, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. During the First World War he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Crean played rugby for Leinster, Ireland and the British Isles. In 1894, he was a member of the first Ireland team to win both a Home Nations Championship and a Triple Crown. Then in 1896 he helped Ireland win their second Home Nations title. He is one of three Ireland rugby union internationals to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The other two are Robert Johnston, who also served with the Imperial Light Horse in the Second Boer War, and Frederick Harvey who served in the First World War. Crean, Johnston and Harvey all played club rugby for Wanderers. In 1896 Crean and Johnston were also members of the same British Isles squad that toured South Africa. Early years =Family= Crean was born in Morrison's Hotel, which stood on the corner of Dawson Street and Nassau Street in Dublin. Some accounts give his place of birth as No. 21 Northbrook Road, the Crean family home at the time he won the VC in 1901. He was the fifth child of Michael Theobald Crean, a barrister originally from Fethard in County Tipperary who worked for the Irish Land Commission, and his wife Emma. His maternal grandparents, John and Maryanne Dunn, were the owners of the hotel where he was born. The Dunns' residence was Esker House, Upper Rathmines Road, and Crean's three older sisters - Mary, Emma and Eleanor – were all born there. Both his older and younger brothers, John and Frank, were also born at Morrison's Hotel. A third brother, Richard, died as an infant, and a fourth sister, Alice Mary, was born in 1879 in the Crean family home at No. 7 Upper Pembroke Street. Alice would later marry Alexander Findlater Todd, one of Crean's rugby teammates on the 1896 British Isles tour of South Africa. John followed in his father's footsteps becoming a barrister in the Land Commission and one of his sons was Fr C.P. Crean MBE, Army chaplain with I Corps during WW2 and Head Chaplain of the Irish Defense Forces from 1956-1962. Frank studied engineering, emigrating to Canada where he undertook a survey of Saskatchewan in 1908-09 on behalf of the Canadian Government. This was the famous 'Frank Crean Expeditions to the New North-West' and Crean Lake in Prince Albert National Park was named in his honor. Crean was named after his uncle Dr. Thomas Joseph Crean, a successful practitioner and civil medical officer in the town of Clonmel, County Tipperary. Also from Clonmel was Lieutenant Colonel Dr. John Joseph Crean, a cousin and close friend to his father who had been with General Graham's Suakin Expedition in Sudan following the fall of Khartoum in 1885. John was a Senior Medical Officer throughout England and the colonies, also holding such positions as Principal Civil Medical Officer (PCMO) of the Straits Settlements in 1886. John was Head of the Army Medical Department in Dublin while Crean was in school at Clongowes. Crean ultimately followed in the footsteps of these two men, becoming both a successful practitioner and an esteemed officer of the Royal Army Medical Corps. =Education= Crean and his brothers all initially attended Belvedere College and Catholic University School before becoming boarders at Clongowes Wood College. Thomas attended Clongowes from 1889 until 1891. As a student he was noted as a fine athlete, excelling not only at rugby but also at both the quarter and half mile running events. He was also a very fine swimmer, and it was as a swimmer that he first demonstrated his bravery. On 11 September 1891, while swimming with fellow students near Blackrock, Dublin, he helped rescue a 21-year-old art student, William Ahern. Crean noticed Ahern was in trouble and together with a young solicitor named Leachman from Dundrum, he managed to bring him ashore. For his bravery he was awarded a medal by the Royal Humane Society. In October 1891 Crean commenced his medical studies at the Royal College of Surgeons and, after graduating as a doctor in 1896, he became a Licentiate of both the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians. Rugby career =Clubs and Province= As a student Crean played at half-back and on joining Wanderers in 1891 he played in the same position for their third XV. However, after switching to the forward row for the 1892-93 season, he was quickly promoted to their senior side. While working as a young doctor in St. Vincent's Hospital, Crean also served as captain of the hospital's rugby team for four years. He went on to represent Leinster against both Ulster and Munster in 1894, 1895 and 1896. During the 1895-96 season he also played for Richmond, possibly working as a medic in London at the same time. When he moved to South Africa he played for Johannesburg Wanderers. =Ireland= Between 1894 and 1896, Crean made 9 appearances and scored two tries for Ireland. He made his international debut on 3 February 1894 in a 7-5 win against England at Blackheath. On 24 February he helped Ireland defeat Scotland 5-0 at Lansdowne Road. Then on 10 March he helped Ireland win both the 1894 Home Nations Championship and their first ever Triple Crown with a 3-0 win against Wales in Belfast. Among his teammates during the 1894 campaign was Lucius Gwynn. Crean also played in all three games during both the 1895 and 1896 Home Nations Championships. He scored both of his tries against Wales. The first came on 16 March 1895 in a 5-3 defeat at Cardiff Arms Park. Crean showed his strength and drive when he scored Ireland's only points by catching a long line-out throw before driving across the line with a number of Welshmen hanging out of him. The second try came at Lansdowne in an 8-4 win on 14 March 1896. The win helped Ireland win their second Home Nations title. This latter game would also be his final appearance for Ireland. =British Lions= In 1896 Crean was a member of the British Isles squad on their tour to South Africa. He was part of strong Irish contingent, being one of nine Irishmen selected. The others included Robert Johnston, Louis Magee, James Magee, Larry Bulger, Jim Sealy, Andrew Clinch, Arthur Meares and Cecil Boyd. He played in all four tests against South Africa and scored a try in the second. The tour captain, Johnny Hammond, only played in seven of the 21 games and Crean took over the captains role in his absence, including for two of the Test games. Military career =Second Boer War= Victoria Cross When the British Isles tour ended, Crean decided to stay on in South Africa, working as a doctor in a hospital in Johannesburg and playing rugby for Johannesburg Wanderers. In 1899, at the start of the Second Boer War, he enlisted as a trooper in the Imperial Light Horse and took part in both the Relief of Mafeking and the Relief of Ladysmith. On 26 October 1899, according to the Irish Times, the Imperial Light Horse particularly distinguished themselves in the Battle of Elandslaagete. The Irish Times of the following day reported with regret that the list of wounded included Crean. It was during this engagement that Crean's former Wanderers and British Isles' teammate Robert Johnston won his Victoria Cross. In 1901, he became a Surgeon Captain and on 18 December, at the Battle of Tygerkloof, he won his VC when he successfully attended the wounds of two soldiers and a fellow officer under heavy enemy fire. The citation read: He was wounded in the stomach and arm during these encounters and was in February 1902 invalided back to England, where he made a full recovery. On 12 March 1902, he was presented with the Victoria Cross by King Edward VII in a ceremony at St. James's Palace. One week later, on 20 March 1902, the members of St. Vincent's Hospital Football Club gave a dinner at the Dolphin Hotel in his honour. In May the same year, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. He was appointed a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps on 3 September 1902, and was posted at Aldershot Garrison. =First World War= In 1905, Crean married Victoria, daughter of Senor Don Thomas Heredia, of Málaga, Spain, and had two sons, Victor (died young), Patrick, and a daughter, Carmen. Victoria had been a close friend to Crean's sister Alice, since their schooling at Roehampton. He transferred to the army reserve on 8 September 1906, and started a private practice in Harley Street. He was later appointed Medical Officer in Charge of the Hospital in the Royal Enclosure, Ascot where he once performed a life saving trepanning operation on a jockey who was thrown from his horse during a race. He ran out onto the course in his shirt sleeves and saved the jockey's life by removing portions of the bones of his skull with a hammer and chisel. However, following the outbreak of the First World War, he was mobilized with the Royal Army Medical Corps on 12 August 1914. He served with the 1st Cavalry Brigade, being wounded several times and was twice mentioned in despatches. In June 1915 he was made a companion of the Distinguished Service Order. He was promoted to Major on 26 February 1916, and commanded the 44th Field Ambulance, British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.www.nationalarchives.gov.uk Later years Crean returned to his practice in Harley Street but by now his war service had begun to seriously affect his health and he was unable to maintain the business. Towards the end of his life Crean suffered from financial difficulties and in June 1922 he was declared bankrupt.

He retired from the Army after the First World War and returned to the Richmond area, taking employment in the City of London as a commissionaire with a firm of solicitors. In 1919 whilst dismounting from a bus in Richmond his leg, injured during the Boer War, gave way. He continued to live at the family home of 151 Halliburton Road, St Margarets, Twickenham until his fatal accident in November 1922. Hampton died in Twickenham on 2 November 1922. Although reported as having taken his own life by jumping in front of a train at Richmond rail station, he did in fact succumb to multiple injuries sustained from falling against a Shepperton train passing through St Margarets railway station in Twickenham. In the subsequent inquest there was no suggestion that he might have taken his own life, the opinion of the coroner being that a leg injured when he had fallen from a bus approximately two years before his death had given way as the Shepperton train passed through St Margarets station. His funeral was held in St Margarets, after which his coffin was carried on a gun carriage with a military escort. He was conveyed from St Margarets, across Richmond Bridge, and on arriving outside Richmond Town Hall, the Mayor, Councillors, and a crowd of several thousand had assembled to pay their respects, many of which then followed the gun carriage to Richmond Cemetery. He is buried in Richmond Cemetery, but for over 50 years his grave remained unmarked. In 1986 the location of the grave was re-discovered by Ron Buddle, a Metropolitan police officer and Victoria Cross historian who, with financial assistance from the King's Regiment Association, erected the present headstone. However, the date of death shown on the headstone of 4 February 1920 was incorrect, the error being corrected when the grave was restored in 2008 as part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames' \\"Adopt a Grave\\" scheme.

Oral tradition of his creation and purpose in these communities is complex, diverse, and born of the ancient Maya traditions centuries ago. Origin The worship of Maximón is believed to have begun at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Maya. The designation of Maximón as a Saint is the result of Religious syncretism.The Drunken, Devilish Mayan God Still Worshiped in Guatemala, VICE, Benjamin Reeves, December 18th, 2013 The modern character of Maximón is thought by analysts to be a blend of several historical, biblical, and Mayan mythological figures. These include Pedro de Alvarado, Judas Iscariot, Saint Peter, and Mam.A Mayan and Catholic Easter Tradition? Yes, in Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala, NBC News, María Martin, April 12th, 2017 Maximón's appearance varies greatly by location. While he's popularly depicted as a man in a suit and hat, this isn't a constant. In Santiago Atitlán, he wears colorful garlands and scarves, while in Zunil, he wears sunglasses and a bandanna. Mythology Maximón is said to represent both light and dark, and to be a trickster. He is both a womanizer and a protector of couples. According to some legends, Maximón was an elder who reincarnated to protect his people. During the Spanish Conquest, an elder named Ri Laj Mam, upset by the evils of the Spaniards, encouraged his people to start a rebellion. He was eventually executed, but returned to life in the form of a judge named Don Ximon, who fought to give land back to the native people of Guatemala.The Legend of Maximon, Organization for Mayan and Indigenous Spiritual Studies, October 14th, 2014 Another legend states that Maximón was hired by traveling fishermen to protect the virtue of their wives. Instead, Maximón disguised himself and slept with all of them.Meet Maximón: The Liquor-Drinking, Chain- Smoking Saint, National Geographic, Bethany Jones, January 24th, 2018 In Santiago Atitlán, an alternative tale says that Maximón was never a man, but a wooden figure created by Shamans to defend the village from witches. However, Maximón used trickery to harm the people of the village, so the Shamans twisted his head around and broke his legs to stop him. He then did his job properly and protected the people of the town from evil.Santiago Atitlán, Maximón Veneration San Simón in Zunil, 2007 Maximón is venerated in the form of an effigy or cult image. Worship varies greatly by location. In Santiago Atitlán, Maximón's effigy resides in a different household every year. His image is normally only taken out of this house during Holy Week, whereafter it will change households, but is on display year-round due to the popularity of pilgrimages. The effigy has special attendants that stay by the altar year-round, drinking and smoking alongside it. They deliver offerings from the public to the image. Popular offerings include money, tobacco, and moonshine. In the town of San Andrés Itzapa, there is a large temple to Maximón. Here, offerings such as corn, flowers, and candles are burned in public by Shamans for the deity. Pilgrims travel to this temple from all across Latin America. Guatemalan press has claimed that the worship of Maximón has declined in recent decades, but this is difficult to measure with much certainty. =Outside of Guatemala= As many Guatemalans have migrated to areas such as Mexico, the United States, and Canada, the veneration of Maximón has traveled beyond the borders of Guatemala, where he is more commonly known as San Simón. There are temples dedicated to him in New York, California, and Florida.Maximón or San Simón: the Mayan folk saint who drinks, smokes and offers protection, LifeGate, Sarine Arslanian, 26 July, 2017 See also * Folk Catholicism * Folk religion * Folk saint * Idolatry * Maya religion Notes Further reading *Pieper, Jim, (2002) Guatemala's Folk Saints *Stanzione, Vincent, (2003) Rituals of Sacrifice External links *Rilaj Maam - Spanish Wikipedia page Christianity and death Christianity and religious syncretism Religion in Guatemala Death gods Folk saints Fortune gods Guatemalan folklore Love and lust gods Maya mythology and religion Catholic Church in Guatemala Superstitions of the Americas Vengeance gods Wonderworkers Fertility gods Maya gods Supernatural beings identified with Christian saints Trickster gods ","title":"Maximón"},{"id":"1218172","text":"James Davis VC (February 1835 - 2 March 1893) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Kney was born in Speyer, Germany. At the age of 15, he apprenticed to Paul Sattel of Speyer to become an organ builder, and concurrently studied organ and composition with Erhard Quack and Ludwig Doerr at the Bishop’s Institute for Church Music in Speyer. In 1951, he moved to Canada to work as a voicer with the Keates Organ Co. In 1955 he formed with John Bright the Kney and Bright Organ Co to build tracker organs. Blanton (1957) described their first instrument as \\"a handsome little organ with mechanical action, slider chests, 1-3/4\\" pressure\\". They were at the vanguard of the tracker organ revival in Canada, so much so that they were then to build 30 electro-pneumatic organs before customers caught on and started ordering instruments with mechanical action. In the early 1960s, they rebuilt the organs of Aeolian Hall in London and St Michael's Cathedral in Toronto.

Early years Heaviside was born in 1880 at Station Lane, Gilesgate in Durham where his father, John Wilson Heaviside, was a grocer. His paternal grandfather was the Durham-based photographer Thomas Heaviside (1828-1886).G. R. Batho (ed.), Durham Biographies, vol.I (Durham: Durham County Local History Society, 2000), pp. 63-66. When Michael was still a boy, the family moved to Kimblesworh, where his father worked as head keeker and Michael went to the local municipal school. Later, the family moved to Sacriston, when his father transferred to the local pit. Following the death of his mother, Annie, Michael enlisted - as 11796 Private Heaviside - in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He served as a stretcher bearer in South Africa during the Boer War and was awarded the Queen's and King's South African Medals, before he was invalided home suffering from enteric fever. After he left the Regular Army, he transferred to the Army Reserve and began work underground at Burnhope Colliery. He met his future wife, Elizabeth, whilst living in Burnhope and they married at Lanchester. About 1913, he took work as a hewer at Oswald pit and the family moved to Craghead, near Stanley. On 7 September 1914, with the First World War just a month old, 4/9720 Private Michael Heaviside re-enlisted, just one amongst the thousands of miners from County Durham who answered Kitchener's call. After training, he crossed to France in June 1915 and there settled into the deadly routine of trench warfare on the Western Front. Details He was 36 years old, and a Private in the 15th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War at the Battle of Arras when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On the evening of 5 May 1917, the battalion returned to their barricades on the Hindenburg Line, near Fontaine-les- Croisilles, France. Only one hundred yards separated the British and German positions but the terrible fighting of the preceding days had died down. Snipers and machine gunners were, however, still active and any movement attracted deadly fire. Then about 2 o’clock the next afternoon, 6 May 1917, a sentry noticed movement in a shell hole about forty yards from the German barricade. A wounded British soldier was desperately waving an empty water bottle. Any attempt to help this soldier in daylight would result in almost certain death for the rescuers. Michael Heaviside, however, said that he was going to try. Grabbing water and a first aid bag, the stretcher bearer scrambled over the barricade and out into no-man's-land. Immediately, he came under heavy rifle and machine gun fire from the German positions and was forced to throw himself to the ground. He then began to crawl sixty yards across the broken ground from shell hole to shell hole to where the wounded soldier was sheltering. One eyewitness later wrote - “We could see bullets striking the ground right around the spot over which Heaviside was crawling. Every minute we expected to be his last but the brave chap went on.” As he crawled closer to the German lines, the firing increased. - “The enemy seemed to be more determined to hit him, for the bullets were spluttering about more viciously than ever.” When Private Heaviside reached the soldier, he found the man nearly demented with thirst for he had been lying badly wounded in the shell hole for four days and three nights, without any food or water. Michael Heaviside gave the soldier water, dressed his wounds and then promised that he would return with help. That night, Michael Heaviside led two other stretcher bearers out across no-man's-land to the wounded soldier and carried him back to safety. Without doubt, he had saved this man's life. The London Gazette announced the award of the Victoria Cross to Private Michael Heaviside on 8 June 1917 for his “most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty.” He was the third soldier of The Durham Light Infantry to gain this award during the First World War. Death After the war, Michael Heaviside VC returned to work as a miner at Craghead. On 26 April 1939, he died at his home at Bloemfontein Terrace, aged just 58 years, his health damaged by his years underground and his time on the Western Front. Hundreds of mourners, many wearing their Great War medals, followed Michael Heaviside's coffin to St Thomas's Church, Craghead, as the local Colliery Band played the “Dead March in Saul.” At the graveside, a firing party from the 8th Battalion DLI fired three volleys of shots, followed by the “Last Post” played by the battalion's buglers, then the mourners filed past, each dropping Flanders poppies into the open grave. The medal On 12 July 1957, forty years after his “Welcome Home” parade through the streets of Stanley and Craghead, Michael Heaviside's Victoria Cross and other medals were presented by his family to The Durham Light Infantry's Regimental Museum. This presentation took place during a parade at Brancepeth Castle, when, watched by his mother and over thirty sons, daughters, grandchildren and other relatives of Michael Heaviside VC, Company Sergeant Major Norman Heaviside proudly handed over his father's medals. The Victoria Cross was displayed at the Durham Light Infantry Museum and Durham Art Gallery. The D.L.I. Museum (now closed) was the official museum of the Durham Light Infantry. Located in Durham the museum housed an extensive array of artifacts and documentation detailing the regiment's history. It featured displays on World War I and World War II activities and exhibits included uniforms, weapons, medals, flags, hats, letters, photographs, badges, ceremonial regalia and many other items associated with the regiment. The museum was located on two floors, with the Durham Art Gallery on a third level. In October 2015 Durham County Council announced the closure of the D.L.I. Museum in a cost saving exercise. This decision sparked the formation of a campaign to save the museum led by John Richardson. The campaign attracted the attention and support of thousands of people from around the world, as well as County Durham itself, who appealed and protested at the County Councils proposed action. The campaign was unsuccessful and the museum closed in March 2016. Durham Light Infantry (DLI) Collection is now based at Spennymoor.

Ingram became Australia's final recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War following his actions during an attack on the village of Montbrehain in France. Leading a platoon during the engagement, he instigated several charges against a number of German strong points that eventuated in the seizure of ten machine guns and sixty-two prisoners, as well as inflicting high casualties. Born in the Victorian town of Bendigo, Ingram was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner upon leaving school. Joining the militia at the age of fourteen, he later settled in Melbourne where he worked as a building contractor. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Ingram enlisted in the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and served on New Guinea before receiving his discharge in early 1916. Enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on the same day, he embarked for the Western Front. He was decorated with the Military Medal following his actions as a member of a bombing section during an attack on Bapaume. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in June 1918, Ingram returned to Australia in 1919 where he was discharged soon after. Re-settling in Melbourne, he was employed as a foreman for a building contractor company. Enlisting for service in the Second World War, he was allotted to the Royal Australian Engineers and achieved the rank of captain before being placed on the Retired List in 1944. Ingram died in 1961 at the age of 72. Early life Ingram was born in Bendigo, Victoria, on 18 March 1889 to George Ronald Ingram, a farmer, and his wife Charlotte (née Hubbard). Initially educated at the Lilydale State School, he left school at age fourteen and was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner. Joining the militia at this time, he was attached to No. 7 Company of the Australian Garrison Artillery and in 1906 attended a military exhibition in New Zealand as a member of the Australian contingent. Completing his apprenticeship, Ingram moved to Caulfield, Melbourne, where he entered into business as a building contractor. On 19 January 1910, Ingram married Jane Francis Nichols in a Congregational ceremony at East Prahran. First World War On 10 December 1914, Ingram enlisted as a private in the 3rd Battalion, Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force at South Yarra. Initially posted for service on the newly captured German territory of New Guinea, he returned to Australia 6 December 1915, and was discharged on 19 January with the rank of corporal. That same day, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 16th Reinforcements of the 24th Battalion as a private. In October, Ingram embarked with the unit from Melbourne aboard HMAT Nestor. Arriving in France, he was appointed acting corporal and joined the 24th Battalion in January 1917. On the night of 15/16 March 1917, Ingram took part in the battalion's attack on the village of Bapaume during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Posted to a bombing section during the engagement, he became involved in a fight with German troops who outnumbered his unit. Making effective use of their grenades, the unit was able to hold off the German attack. Later during the assault, the German forces returned in large numbers, forcing the bombing section to retreat. Ingram, in conjunction with two others, covered the party's withdrawal which thus minimised casualties. For his actions during the battle, Ingram was awarded the Military Medal, the citation noting his \\"... great courage and initiative ...\\". The announcement of the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 11 May 1917. Promoted to temporary sergeant on 18 March, Ingram fell ill in April and was hospitalised in Britain until June when he was deemed fit to return to his battalion. He was hospitalised once again in September after dislocating his knee, and upon returning to his unit on 10 October he was made company sergeant major. It was at this time that the Australian focus for the remainder of the year was to be the Ypres sector in Belgium, and as such the 24th Battalion participated in the Battle of Passchendaele. During this time, Ingram was recommended for a commission in the 24th Battalion as a second lieutenant, which was confirmed on 20 June 1918. Three days later, however, he was once again admitted to hospital suffering from an illness, and as such was unable to assume his duties as an officer until 12 July when he returned to the battalion. =Victoria Cross= On 4 October 1918, the 24th Battalion took part in the attack that captured the Beaurevoir sector in France, and was, therefore, expecting to have a rest the following day when the unit was unexpectedly ordered to take part in another attack. The assault was to commence at 06:05 from the village of Remicourt, and lead to the capture of Montbrehain by the 21st and 24th Battalions with tanks to provide support. The action was to prove the final engagement for the Australian infantry during the war, and it was during this attack that Ingram was to earn the Victoria Cross; the sixty- fourth, and final, Australian to do so during the First World War. At the designated time, the two infantry battalions commenced the attack under the cover of an artillery barrage. The advance was heavily counter-attacked by German machine gun and artillery fire, but the Australians managed to continue despite the late arrival of the tanks. Approximately from the German trenches, the 24th Battalion's B Company—in which Ingram was commanding a platoon—became the object of severe sniper and machine gun fire, halting the unit's advance. Under the cover of a Lewis Gun, Ingram dashed ahead of his men and led them against the German strong point. After a fierce fight, the platoon succeeded in capturing nine machine guns and killing all forty-two Germans who had occupied the line; Ingram accounting for at least eighteen of them himself. Lt. G.M. Ingram Soon after, the company came under heavy fire from an old quarry occupied by over one hundred German soldiers who possessed as many as forty machine guns. Severe casualties were sustained as they began to advance for attack, including the company commander who fell seriously wounded. Taking command of the attack, Ingram rallied the men and rushed forward. Jumping into the quarry, he charged the first post himself, shooting six German soldiers and capturing a machine gun. The German forces were soon overcome, and thirty troops subsequently surrendered. While his men were clearing up the remaining German positions, Ingram scouted ahead in search of machine gun nests in the village. He soon located one positioned in a house, which had been firing through the cellar ventilator. Managing to enter the house, he shot the gunner through the ventilator. He fired several more shots into the cellar before rushing to the head of the cellar stairs. By thus cutting off any means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner. The battle for Montbrehain raged until 20:00 that night, during which time the line had been linked up and consolidated. The casualties of the 24th Battalion had been so high that two companies of the 27th Battalion had to be attached for support; the 24th Battalion left the frontline for the last time on 6 October. The full citation for Ingram's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 6 January 1919, it read: Ingram was promoted to lieutenant on 24 October, and was training away from the frontline with his battalion when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918; thus ending the war. On 25 February 1919, Ingram was decorated with his Victoria Cross by King George V in the ballroom of Buckingham Palace. Boarding a troopship bound for Australia soon after, he arrived in Melbourne on 5 March and was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 2 June. Later life A group of Victoria Cross recipients lined up to march in the 1927 Melbourne Anzac Day march. Ingram is front row, second from left. Following his discharge, Ingram re-settled in Melbourne and gained employment as a general foreman with E. A. & Frank Watts Pty Ltd, building contractors. In 1926, Ingram's marriage with his wife Jane was dissolved upon his instigation on the grounds of desertion on her behalf. On 10 February the following year, he married Lillian Wakeling (née Hart), a widow, at the Methodist parsonage, Malvern; the pair were later to have one son. On 11 November 1929, Ingram attended the Victoria Dinner for recipients of the Victoria Cross in Melbourne. Following the completion of Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance in 1935, Ingram was chosen as a member of its permanent guard. There had been two hundred and fifty applications for the position, of which only fourteen were appointed; Ingram being one of the earliest. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Ingram once again volunteered his services and enlisted in the militia on 17 November 1939. Posted to a unit in the Royal Australian Engineers, he achieved the rank of captain before being placed on the Retired List on 6 May 1944.

Ingram's wife Lillian died in May 1951, and on 24 December of the same year he married another widow, Myrtle Lydia Thomas (née Cornell), in a ceremony at Brunswick Methodist Church; the couple later had a son, Alex. In 1954, Ingram attended the dedication of the Shrine of Remembrance by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh on 28 February following an expansion on the monument to encompass Australia's contributions to the Second World War. Two years later, he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the Victoria Cross. Ingram died of coronary vascular disease at his home in Hastings, Victoria, on 30 June 1961, and was buried at Frankston Cemetery. He is commemorated by a street name in Canberra. On 27 May 2008, the Victoria Cross, Military Medal and campaign medals awarded to Ingram were sold at auction by Sotheby's of Melbourne for A$478,000. The medals were sold on behalf of Ingram's son, Alex, who was concerned about the security of the group and was experiencing financial strain. The purchaser, rumoured to be media mogul Kerry Stokes, indicated that the Victoria Cross would be donated to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. This subsequently took place, and Ingram's medals are displayed in the Memorial's Hall of Valour.

Davey enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in December 1914 for service in World War I, and joined his unit, the 10th Battalion, on the island of Lemnos on 10 April 1915. Along with his battalion, he landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April. He fought at Anzac until he was evacuated sick in early November, returning to Australia the following January. Davey embarked for England in June 1916, and rejoined his battalion on the Western Front in October. In January 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in rescuing a wounded man under fire. He was promoted to corporal in April. In the lead-up to the capture of Merris in June, he killed an eight-man German machine-gun crew, saving his platoon from annihilation, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia to be discharged, and was employed by South Australian Railways over many years before dying in 1953, having suffered for years with bronchitis and emphysema. He was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial. Early life Phillip Davey was born on 10 October 1896 at Unley, South Australia, to William George Davey, a carpenter, and his wife Elizabeth O'Neill; he was one of five sons of the couple who would see service in World War I. Phillip attended Flinders Street Model School and Goodwood Public School. After his schooling, he was involved in well boring and opal mining in Central Australia; at the outbreak of World War I he was a horse driver. World War I On 22 December 1914, aged 18, Davey enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was posted to the 2nd reinforcements to the 10th Battalion. He sailed for Egypt from Melbourne on 2 February 1915. He joined the 3rd Brigade's 10th Battalion on board the in the port of Mudros on the island of Lemnos in the northeastern Aegean Sea on 10 April 1915. The 3rd Brigade had been chosen as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April. The brigade embarked on the battleship and the destroyer , and after transferring to strings of rowing- boats initially towed by steam pinnaces, the battalion began rowing ashore at about 4:30am. Davey participated in the heavy fighting at the landing and subsequent trench warfare defending the beachhead. After several bouts of illness, he was evacuated to Egypt with enteric fever in early November. In January 1916 he was repatriated to Australia to recover his health. He re- embarked at Melbourne in June, arrived in the United Kingdom in August, and embarked for France the following month. While he had been recuperating, the infantry formations of the AIF had been withdrawn from Gallipoli to Egypt, then transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium. Davey rejoined the 10th Battalion in early October. From the time Davey returned, the 10th Battalion rotated through front-line, reserve, training and fatigue duties, mainly in the Somme river sector. In February 1917, it participated in an operation at Le Barque, southwest of Bapaume. On 15 March, Davey was accidentally wounded by a hand grenade while the battalion was in camp, but returned to duty less than a month later, during the Battle of Arras. He was promoted to lance corporal in early May, at which time the battalion was fighting in a support role at Bullecourt. In September, the battalion was committed to the Passchendale offensive, specifically at the Battle of Menin Road at Polygon Wood. The following month Davey was gassed while the 10th Battalion was relieving troops in the front-line near Westhoek Ridge; he returned to his unit in early November. Through the winter of 1917/1918, the battalion rotated through various duties, in and out of the front-line. On 3 January 1918, Davey rescued a wounded soldier under heavy fire, and was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field. The recommendation read: Davey was promoted to corporal on 24 April 1918, and that night the 10th Battalion conducted an operation near Méteren. The following month he was detached to Tidworth in England as an instructor, but returned to his unit at his own request on 23 June. Five days later, he was with his battalion during a \\"peaceful penetration\\" operation near Merris. Over the previous 18 months, the 10th Battalion had developed raising and patrolling skills that were critical in this type of more open warfare. The 10th's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Wilder-Neligan, initially ordered a platoon to secure a position around a hedge. As this was successful, and another platoon achieved similar success, he then committed two companies to the operation, covered by a smoke screen and trench mortar fire. One platoon reached the hedge, and began to dig in, when a nearby machine gun opened fire, killing the platoon commander, causing other casualties and scattering the platoon. Davey then went forward alone twice, and using hand grenades, killed the crew and captured the machine gun. He then turned it on a German counter-attack, which was repelled. alt=a colour photograph of a medal suspended from a riband Davey's actions in single-handedly eliminating a German machine gun post resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. He was initially recommended for the Distinguished Conduct Medal, but when the recommendation reached the commander of XV Corps, Lieutenant General Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle, he upgraded it to a recommendation for the VC and noted, \\"[a] most gallant and self-sacrificing action\\". The citation read: Davey's platoon was soon relieved by a reserve platoon that re-established the post. The 10th Battalion operation had seized of the German front line, along with thirty-five prisoners, six machine guns and two Minenwerfer trench mortars, for the loss of fifty casualties. Davey had sustained wounds to his back, abdomen and legs, and was evacuated to England. After he had recovered sufficiently he received his Victoria Cross at Buckingham Palace on 12 September. On this occasion, Wilder-Neligan wrote a note to Davey which said: Davey then embarked to return to Australia in October, and was discharged from the AIF on 24 February 1919. A fellow VC recipient, Arthur Blackburn later said, \\"I think all agree that no VC was ever better earned than Phil Davey's\\". Four of Davey's brothers had also enlisted, Claude, Richard, Joseph and Arthur, with Joseph being aged 16 when he joined up. Joseph was wounded at Pozières and was promoted to lance corporal before his real age was discovered and he was sent home. Phillip's brothers Claude and Richard were also awarded the Military Medal during World War I, Claude being killed in action in 1917. Later life West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide After returning from the war, Davey worked for South Australian Railways as a labourer and linesman over three periods between 1926 and 1946: 27 April 1926 to 4 October 1938; 6 March 1939 to 12 February 1942; and 17 December 1943 to 22 February 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928; they had no children. After suffering for many years with bronchitis and emphysema, Davey died on 21 December 1953 of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, with full military honours. As well as the Victoria Cross, Military Medal, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Davey was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 1967, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour.

Early life Born at Ladywood in Birmingham on 24 August 1888, he attended St. Philip's School (more correctly St Philip's Grammar School}, Edgbaston. He married Mabel Saunderson in May 1915. He joined the Post Office and worked as a Clerical Assistant in the North Midland Engineering District.

Leak enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in early 1915, and served with the 9th Battalion in the Gallipoli Campaign during the First World War. Evacuated suffering from dysentery, Leak rejoined his battalion after it had been withdrawn to Egypt. Along with his unit, he transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium, where he participated in the Battle of Pozières in July 1916. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle. The following month he was seriously wounded in the Battle of Mouquet Farm. Leak was evacuated to the United Kingdom, and did not return to his unit until October 1917. Suffering from the effects of his service, Leak was convicted of desertion by a court-martial in November, but his sentence was ultimately suspended, and he returned to the 9th Battalion. In early March 1918 he was gassed, and did not rejoin to his unit until the Armistice of 11 November 1918. He returned to Australia and was discharged in 1919. After jobs in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia over the next twenty years, Leak settled in South Australia in 1937. He was severely affected by his war experiences, and was very reticent to discuss his VC exploits. He did not talk about his service, even to his family, until very late in life. He died in October 1972 and is buried in Stirling, South Australia. Early life According to his war record, John Leak was born in Portsmouth, United Kingdom, around 1892, although there is no record of his birth in that city. He was the son of a miner, James Leak. His parents were originally from South Wales, and apparently migrated to New South Wales, Australia, well before World WarI, although there is no record of his arrival in Australia. By the outbreak of the war, his parents had died, and Leak was living at Clermont, Queensland, and working as a teamster. World War I On 28 January 1915, Leak enlisted in Rockhampton as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was assigned to the fifth reinforcement draft for the 9th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. On 16 April, he embarked from Brisbane, Queensland, on board the transport Kyarra. He joined his battalion on 22 June while it was involved in trench warfare defending the Anzac Cove beachhead on the Gallipoli Peninsula in the Ottoman Empire. This fighting was part of the Gallipoli Campaign. Six days after Leak's arrival, the 9th Battalion was involved in a two-pronged attack against the Ottoman positions on what were known as \\"Sniper's Ridge\\" and \\"Knife Edge\\", close to Lone Pine. The attack was abortive, and resulted in the battalion suffering casualties of 37 killed and 62 wounded. Leak was with his battalion during the fruitless August Offensive, which was intended as a breakout from the beachhead. On 31 August, Leak reported sick and was evacuated with gastroenteritis, first via hospital ship to Malta, where he was hospitalised and diagnosed with dysentery. In late September he was evacuated to the United Kingdom where he was again hospitalised. He did not return to his unit until 23 February 1916, by which time it, along with the rest of the AIF, had been withdrawn back to Egypt for re-organisation. In March 1916, Leak and the rest of his battalion sailed for France and the Western Front. They spent several weeks in a quiet sector of the line near Armentières, before deploying south to the Somme river valley, where they experienced their first fighting in France. On 1July, the Battle of the Somme commenced. This mainly British offensive involved attacks against German trench systems on either side of the Somme. British troops pushed slowly forward towards Bapaume until they were just short of the village of Pozières, at which time the Australian 1st Division entered the fray in the Battle of Pozières. The German positions at Pozières were known as the \\"Old German\\" (OG) trenchesOG1 and OG2. The Australians launched a preliminary operation on 22 July, but were repulsed. The following day, the division attacked again, this time with the 1st Brigade on the left, and the 3rd Brigade on the right. Leak's battalion was allocated a sector on the far right flank of the divisional attack. The troops captured the first objective, but were held up by a German position where OG1 met \\"Pozières Trench\\". alt=a bronze Cross pattée suspended from a crimson ribbon The 9th Battalion was being held up by a pair of German machine guns. An intense bomb (hand grenade) fight began, during which the heavier Mills bombs used by the Australians were outranged by the lighter German Model 17 grenades. Leak ran forward and threw three Mills bombs into the machine gun post, then leapt into the post, attacking the garrison with his bayonet. By the time the rest of his platoon got to the post, Leak was wiping blood off his bayonet with his slouch hat. The fighting around Pozières continued after this incident, and two days later the Germans laid down a tremendous artillery barrage on the positions that had been captured from them, described by the official Australian war correspondent, Charles Bean, as \\"among the heaviest that occurred either on the Somme or at Verdun\\". During the fighting and the subsequent deluge of shells, the 9th Battalion had been reduced from a strength of 1,016 men to 623. On 31 July, Leak was recommended for the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Pozières. At that time, the VC was the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces. After Pozières, the 9th Battalion was relieved, but it was back in action in mid-August during the Battle of Mouquet Farm. During this fighting, the 9th Battalion suffered another 163 casualties. One of those casualties was Leak, who had suffered a serious wound to the back on 21 August, during a German artillery bombardment near the \\"Gibraltar\\" blockhouse. While he was in a medical facility in France, his VC was gazetted. The citation read: alt=a black and white group photograph of a uniformed Leak with a group of admirers. Leak is holding the hand of a woman standing next to him. Leak was evacuated to hospital in the United Kingdom on 13 September. On 4November, he was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace. While in the UK, he breached military discipline on two occasions. In the first instance, he was charged for entering the Sergeants' Mess and demanding a drink, and disobeying his regimental sergeant major in January 1917. For this he was convicted and underwent fourteen days' detention. On 23 February, he went absent without leave until 2March, and following this conviction was punished with four days' detention and fifteen days' loss of pay. On 23 March, Leak was transferred from the 9th Battalion to the 69th Battalion. The 69th Battalion was being raised in the United Kingdom as part of the short-lived 16th Brigade, 6th Division, which was being formed using men who were recovering from wounds or illness in the United Kingdom. In June, Leak gave evidence at the trial of an Australian soldier accused of wearing a VC ribbon on his uniform when he was not a recipient of the award. In his evidence, Leak said he had never asked the man about his VC, because \\"he objected to [being] questioned himself about his own deed.\\" He went absent without leave again in July, but this time only received a fine. The 69th Battalion was disbanded to provide reinforcements to existing units, and on 11 August Leak was transferred back to the 9th Battalion and marched out to the Overseas Training Depot. Leak returned to the Western Front in October, after his battalion had fought in the Battles of Broodseinde and Passchendaele in Belgium. By this stage, Leak was clearly affected by combat-related trauma and was not coping with the effects of the relentless shell-fire, and went absent without leave from his unit as it deployed forward into the front line to relieve Canadian troops on 1November. He was arrested five days later, was court-martialled on 23 November, and found guilty of desertion from the line between 1and 6November. During his trial, Leak said he was unable to stand artillery fire. His sentence was life imprisonment, but this was commuted to two years hard labour. Ultimately, the sentence was suspended, and Leak returned to his unit on 23 December. Leak continued to serve on the Western Front with his battalion until 7March 1918, when he was gassed during a lengthy bombardment of his unit's positions near Hollebeke. Medically evacuated to the United Kingdom once again, he did not return to his unit before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. On 30 December 1918, after his court-martial sentence was finally remitted, Leak married Beatrice May Chapman in Cardiff, Wales. On 9February 1919, Leak and Beatrice sailed for Australia aboard the , arriving in Queensland on 26 March. On 10 April, he attended a reception in his honour at Rockhampton, but declined to speak, then returned to Clermont by train. He was discharged from the AIF on 31 May. In addition to his VC, he received the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. Later life and legacy For a short time, Leak was involved in a firewood business with a couple of other returned servicemen, then spent time working in regional New South Wales. Next, he moved to remote mid-north South Australia where he found work boring wells. At some point he and his wife separated; it is unknown what happened to her. On 12 January 1927, he married Ada Victoria Bood-Smith; the couple were devoted to one another. In 1932, they moved to Esperance, Western Australia, where Leak worked in a garage. In 1937, Leak was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal. In the same year, the Leak family moved back to South Australia, and settled near Crafers. They had eight children in total, although their first died within a year of her birth; the last was born in 1946. Leak struggled his whole life with his war experiences, and was reluctant to talk about them for many years. One of his sons observed that \\"World War One destroyed him.\\" He did not attend reunions or Anzac Day marches, and faded into obscurity. Later in life he shared some of his experiences with his children, remembering dead comrades and also those he had killed. He stored his VC in a box in his bedroom and it largely stayed there. In later life, Leak suffered from bronchitis and emphysema caused by his gassing in 1918. In 1953, Leak was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. In 1964, Ada died suddenly. Two years later, a fake VC with Leak's name engraved on it surfaced in Melbourne, Victoria; the dealer was fined for being in possession of a forged VC. On 20 October 1972, Leak died at Redwood Park and was buried alongside Ada in the Stirling cemetery. A street in Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, Queensland, is named after him. The John Leak monument was unveiled in Rockhampton on 20 April 2012 to honour Leak, who enlisted in the city. In 2015, while delivering the Ode of Remembrance, Leak's grandson Peter Townsend said his family always travel to Rockhampton for the Remembrance Day service, which is held annually at his grandfather's memorial.

Life and work Lindeberg was son of a teacher at the Helsinki Polytechnical Institute and at an early age showed mathematical talent and interest. The family was well off and later Jarl Waldemar would prefer to be a reader than a full professor. Lindeberg's career centred on the University of Helsinki. His early interests were in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations but from 1920 he worked in probability and statistics. In 1920 he published his first paper on the central limit theorem. His result was similar to that obtained earlier by Lyapunov whose work he did not then know. However, their approaches were quite different; Lindeberg's was based on a convolution argument while Lyapunov used the characteristic function. Two years later Lindeberg used his method to obtain a stronger result: the so-called Lindeberg condition. His work on probability led to him becoming involved in applied fields. He developed what we know as Kendall's τ and he found the first two moments of its sampling distribution. Lindeberg used line transect methods in forestry, and when in 1926 determining the necessary number of transects to obtain a sufficiently precise confidence interval, he seems to have rediscovered Student's t-distribution. The Swedish mathematician Harald Cramér met Lindeberg in 1922. He later recalled this story about Lindeberg and the beautiful farm he owned. \\"When he was reproached for not being sufficiently active in his scientific work, he said 'Well, I am really a farmer.' And if somebody happened to say that his farm was not properly cultivated, his answer was 'Of course my real job is to be a professor.'

The ward contains the areas of Hartcliffe and Headley Park, as well as small portions of Withywood and Bishopsworth. Hartcliffe is a post-World War II suburban development, consisting largely of council houses. It is one of the poorer areas of Bristol, with significant social problems exacerbated by the decline of industrial employment in the city. Regeneration efforts are underway. Hartcliffe Hartcliffe Methodist Church Hartcliffe is a district of Bristol, England. It is a council estate on the southern edges of the city next to Withywood, on the northern slopes of Dundry Hill. Construction started in 1952 after the compulsory purchase of a number of pre-existing farms. A small shopping area was built (Symes Avenue), and the first church (St Andrew) opened in 1956. Former Imperial Tobacco offices being converted into apartments Imperial Tobacco once had offices and a factory in Hartcliffe. Part of the site is now the Imperial Retail Park while the listed headquarters building is being converted into the Lakeshore flats. Hartcliffe and Withywood Community Partnership (HWCP) was formed by local residents in 1998 to help support the regeneration and renewal of the area. Schools within Hartcliffe include Fair Furlong Primary School, Hareclive Academy, and Bridge Learning Campus. Hartcliffe Community Farm was opened in 1979 by Hartcliffe Community Council leader Doris Fiedor MA Hons UWE (1919–1995)who founded the community farm. It has over of land based at the farmyard at the top of Lampton Avenue, Hartcliffe. A 250-year-old tithe barn was erected at the farm by YTS trainees but burned down in an arson attack. The farm remains open daily to the public and hosts regular visits by school parties. Symes Avenue is the District Shopping Centre serving the outer estates of Hartcliffe and Withywood with a total population of around 20,000 people. The estates, built in the 1950s and 1960s, have long been identified as suffering a multitude of different problems which characterise a socially excluded community. On 16 July 1992 there was a riot in Hartcliffe estate after two men who were riding a stolen and unmarked police motorbike were killed in a chase with an unmarked police car. The disturbance lasted for three days. Police were stoned and many shops in the Symes Avenue shopping centre were attacked and destroyed. Around the same time, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown claimed that health indicators in the area were comparable to those of a Third World country. On 12 November 2007, a Morrisons supermarket opened after a massive redevelopment of the area. The redevelopment also includes a new library. Headley Park Headley Park is a suburb of Bristol. The original estate was built between 1934 and 1938. It is located in South Bristol between Bedminster Down, Bishopsworth, Knowle West and Hartcliffe, and is a largely residential area. The area is served by one public house, The Maytree which is located on St Peters Rise. The main Christian Church serving the area is located on St Peters Rise. A church has been on the site for 60 years, and was originally known as Crossways Tabernacle but since 2007 was renamed Headley Park Church following a partnership between Crossways Tabernacle and Kensington Baptist Church in the north of Bristol.

The operation was authorized by U.S. President Harry Truman and planned by the Central Intelligence Agency. The United Fruit Company had lobbied intensively for the overthrow because land reform initiated by Árbenz threatened its economic interests. The US also feared that the government of Árbenz was being influenced by communists. The coup attempt was planned with the support of the United Fruit Company, and of Anastasio Somoza García, Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-backed right- wing dictators of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela respectively, who felt threatened by the democratic Guatemalan Revolution, and had sought to undermine it. The plan involved providing weapons to the exiled Guatemalan military officer Carlos Castillo Armas, who was to lead an invasion from Nicaragua. The US State Department discovered that details of the plan had become widely known. US Secretary of State Dean Acheson became concerned that the coup attempt would damage the image of the US, which had committed to a policy of non-intervention, and so terminated the operation. Operation PBFortune was followed two years later by Operation PBSuccess, another covert operation in which Castillo Armas played a prominent role. PBSuccess toppled the Árbenz government and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Background A mural celebrating Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz and his agrarian reform program, which benefited 500,000 people From the late 19th century until 1944, a series of authoritarian rulers governed Guatemala. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company and dispossessed many indigenous peoples of their communal land. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified with the institution of brutal labor regulations and the establishment of a police state. In June 1944, a popular pro-democracy movement led by university students and labor organizations forced Ubico to resign. Ubico handed over power to a military junta that was toppled in a military coup led by Jacobo Árbenz in October 1944, an event known as the October Revolution. The coup leaders called for open elections, which were won by Juan José Arévalo, a progressive professor of philosophy who had become the face of the popular movement. He implemented a moderate program of social reform, including a successful literacy campaign and largely free elections, although illiterate women were not given the vote, and communist parties were banned. Following the end of Arévalo's highly popular presidency in 1951, Árbenz was elected president. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land reform program known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Some governments in Central America and the Caribbean were hostile to Árbenz and the Guatemalan Revolution. Anastasio Somoza García, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-backed right-wing dictators of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively, felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Under Arévalo, Guatemala had become a haven for pro-democracy activists from those three countries. Somoza, Trujillo, and Jiménez had supported Guatemalan exiles working to undermine the Guatemalan government, in addition to suppressing democratic popular movements in their own countries. The political climate of the Cold War led the US government to see the policies of Arévalo and Árbenz as communist. This conception had been strengthened by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion, and by the 1950s the US government was considering overthrowing Árbenz. The attitude of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and to make certain that access to resources and markets was not limited. Historian Mark Gilderhus opines that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. Before 1944, the US government had not needed to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US. Planning =Somoza's visit= In May 1952, Árbenz enacted Decree 900, the official title of the Guatemalan agrarian reform law. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The United Fruit Company lost several hundred thousand acres of its uncultivated land to this law, and the compensation it received was based on the undervalued price it had presented to the Guatemalan government for tax purposes. The company therefore intensified its lobbying in Washington D.C. against the Guatemalan government. The law convinced the US government that the Guatemalan government was being influenced by communists. The US government's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the Director of Central Intelligence, ordered J. C. King, the chief of the Western Hemisphere Division, to examine whether dissident Guatemalans could topple the Árbenz government if they had support from the dictatorships in Central America. At this point the US government was approached by Nicaraguan leader Somoza, who had been in the United States on a private visit, during which he made public speeches praising the US, and was awarded a medal by New York City. During a meeting with Truman and his senior staff, Somoza said that if he were given the weapons, he would \\"clean up Guatemala\\". Truman's personal military advisor, Major General Harry H. Vaughan, persuaded Truman to explore the opportunity further, and Truman asked Smith to follow up. =Carlos Castillo Armas= Although the proposal was not taken seriously at the time, US Colonel Cornelius Mara flew back to Nicaragua with Somoza to further explore the idea. Somoza persuaded Mara that the plan was feasible, and Mara returned to the US and gave Truman a favorable report. Smith also sent a Spanish-speaking engineer under the codename \\"Seekford\\" to contact exiled Guatemalan Army officer Carlos Castillo Armas and his fellow dissidents, who were in Honduras and Guatemala. Francisco Javier Arana had launched an ill-fated coup attempt against Arévalo in 1949. Castillo Armas had been a protégé of Arana, and had risen in the military to become the head of the military academy of Guatemala by 1949. Historians differ on what happened to Castillo Armas following the coup attempt. Piero Gleijeses writes that Castillo Armas was expelled from the country; Nick Cullather and Andrew Fraser, however, say Castillo Armas was arrested in August 1949, that Árbenz had him imprisoned under doubtful charges until December 1949, and that he was found in Honduras a month later. In early 1950, a CIA officer found Castillo Armas attempting to get weapons from Somoza and Trujillo. He met with the CIA a few more times before November 1950, when he launched an attack against Matamoros, the largest fortress in the capital, and was jailed for it before bribing his way out of prison. Castillo Armas told the CIA he had the support of the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard), the garrison at Quetzaltenango, Guatemala's second-largest city, and of the commander of Matamoros. The engineer dispatched by the CIA also told them Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. Based on these reports, Truman authorized Operation PBFortune. According to Gleijeses, he did not inform the US State Department, or secretary of state Dean Acheson, of the plan. Based upon an examination of declassified documents, however, Cullather has said the CIA did, in fact, seek State Department approval before authorizing the plan, and that undersecretary of state David K. E. Bruce provided explicit approval for it. CIA Deputy Director Allen Dulles had previously contacted State Department official Thomas Mann and the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Edward G. Miller, Jr.. Both these individuals had said they wanted a new government in Guatemala even if it involved the use of force, but when asked, did not explicitly approve of action to topple Árbenz. Dulles assumed their vague responses implied support, but obtained explicit assent from Bruce before proceeding. =The plot= The details of the plot were finalized over the next few weeks by the CIA, the United Fruit Company, and Somoza. The coup's plotters contacted Trujillo and Jiménez, who, along with Somoza and Juan Manuel Gálvez, the right-wing President of Honduras, had already been exchanging intelligence about the Árbenz government, and had considered the possibility of supporting an invasion by Guatemalan exiles. The two dictators were supportive of the plan, and agreed to contribute some funding. Although PBFortune was officially approved on September 9, 1952, planning had begun earlier in the year. In January 1952, officers in the CIA's Directorate of Plans compiled a list of \\"top flight Communists whom the new government would desire to eliminate immediately in the event of a successful anti-Communist coup\\". The assassination plans represented the first time the US had considered assassination in Guatemala. The list of targets had been drawn up by the CIA even before the operation had been formally authorized. They were created using a list of communists that the Guatemalan Army had compiled in 1949, as well as its own intelligence. Nine months later the CIA also received through \\"Seekford\\" a list of 58 Guatemalans whom Castillo Armas wanted killed, in addition to 74 others he wanted arrested or exiled. \\"Seekford\\" also said Trujillo's support was conditional on the assassination of four individuals from Santo Domingo who were at that point living in Guatemala. The plan was to be carried out by Castillo Armas, and involve no direct intervention from the US. When contacted by the CIA agent dispatched by Smith, Castillo Armas had proposed a battle-plan to gain CIA support. This plan involved three forces invading Guatemala from Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador. These invasions were supposed to be supported by internal rebellions. King formulated a plan to provide Castillo Armas with $225,000 as well as weaponry and transportation. His plan also suggested that Somoza and Gálvez be persuaded to provide air support, in addition to other help. The proposal went to Dulles. It emphasized the relatively small role the CIA was supposed to play, and stated that without the CIA's support, the plot would probably go ahead, but would likely fail and lead to a crackdown on anti-Communist forces. Execution and termination US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, whose intervention ended the operation The plan was put into motion in autumn 1952 by the CIA. King had obtained weapons from the stock of those that had been confiscated by port authorities in the city of New York. These included 250 rifles, 380 pistols, 64 machine guns, and 4,500 grenades. The United Fruit Company lent one of its freighters to the CIA. The freighter was specially refitted in New Orleans, and loaded with weapons under the guise of agricultural machinery. It was scheduled to sail to Nicaragua in early October 1952. The CIA had encouraged Somoza and Gálvez to provide support to Castillo Armas' forces. Somoza, however, informed several government officials across Central America of the CIA's role in the coup attempt. Somoza's son Tacho, for instance, casually asked Miller whether \\"the machinery\\" was on its way at a meeting in Panama. Accounts of the operation's termination vary between historians. Gleijeses said that while the freighter was on its way to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that, due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on October 8, Acheson summoned Smith and called it off. Acheson was particularly worried that allowing the details of the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. Under the Rio Pact of 1947, the Organization of American States (OAS) had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. To achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. If PBFortune had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a fellow member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy, thus motivating the State Department to end the operation when they became aware its cover had been blown. Aftermath The termination of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there in the hope that the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3,000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from \\"Seekford\\" that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department. In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was elected president of the US after a campaign promising a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US-trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of psychological warfare by the CIA. Gálvez, Somoza, Jiménez, and Trujillo again offered the CIA their support in preparing for this operation. Árbenz resigned on June 27, 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. Following his resignation, the CIA launched Operation PBHistory, an attempt to use documents from Árbenz's government and elsewhere to justify the coup in response to the negative international reactions to it. From 1954 onward Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War which lasted until 1996. Approximately 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. Of these violations, 93 percent were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.

In optics, a diaphragm is a thin opaque structure with an opening (aperture) at its center. The role of the diaphragm is to stop the passage of light, except for the light passing through the aperture. Thus it is also called a stop (an aperture stop, if it limits the brightness of light reaching the focal plane, or a field stop or flare stop for other uses of diaphragms in lenses). The diaphragm is placed in the light path of a lens or objective, and the size of the aperture regulates the amount of light that passes through the lens. The centre of the diaphragm's aperture coincides with the optical axis of the lens system. Most modern cameras use a type of adjustable diaphragm known as an iris diaphragm, and often referred to simply as an iris. See the articles on aperture and f-number for the photographic effect and system of quantification of varying the opening in the diaphragm. Iris diaphragms versus other types Nine-blade iris Pentacon 2.8/135 lens with 15-blade iris Aperture mechanism of Canon 50mm f/1.8 II lens, with five blades A natural optical system that has a diaphragm and an aperture is the human eye. The iris is the diaphragm, the pupil is the aperture. In the human eye, the iris can both constrict and dilate, which varies the size of the pupil. Unsurprisingly, a photographic lens with the ability to continuously vary the size of its aperture (the hole in the middle of the annular structure) is known as an iris diaphragm. An iris diaphragm can reduce the amount light that hits a detector by decreasing the aperture, usually with \\"leaves\\" or \\"blades\\" that form a circle. In the early years of photography, a lens could be fitted with one of a set of interchangeable diaphragms , often as brass strips known as Waterhouse stops or Waterhouse diaphragms. The iris diaphragm in most modern still and video cameras is adjusted by movable blades, simulating the iris of the eye. The diaphragm has two to twenty blades (with most lenses today featuring between five and ten blades), depending on price and quality of the device in which it is used. Straight blades result in polygon shape of the diaphragm opening, while curved blades improve the roundness of the iris opening. In a photograph, the number of blades that the iris diaphragm has can be guessed by counting the number of diffraction spikes converging from a light source or bright reflection. For an odd number of blades, there are twice as many spikes as there are blades. In case of an even number of blades, the two spikes per blade will overlap each other, so the number of spikes visible will be the number of blades in the diaphragm used. This is most apparent in pictures taken in the dark with small bright spots, for example night cityscapes. Some cameras, such as the Olympus XA or lenses such as the MC Zenitar-ME1, however, use a two-bladed diaphragm with right-angle blades creating a square aperture. Similarly, out-of-focus points of light (circles of confusion) appear as polygons with the same number of sides as the aperture has blades. If the blurred light is circular, then it can be inferred that the aperture is either round or the image was shot \\"wide-open\\" (with the blades recessed into the sides of the lens, allowing the interior edge of the lens barrel to effectively become the iris). The shape of the iris opening has a direct relation with the appearance of the blurred out-of-focus areas in an image called bokeh. A rounder opening produces softer and more natural out-of- focus areas. Some lenses utilize specially shaped diaphragms in order to create certain effects. This includes the diffusion discs or sieve aperture of the Rodenstock Tiefenbildner-Imagon, Fuji and Sima soft focus lenses, the sector aperture of Seibold's Dreamagon, or the circular apodization filter in the Minolta/Sony Smooth Trans Focus or Fujifilm APD lenses. Some modern automatic point-and-shoot cameras do not have a diaphragm at all, and simulate aperture changes by using an automatic ND filter. Unlike a real diaphragm, this has no effect on depth of field. A real diaphragm when more-closed will cause the depth of field to increase (i.e., cause the background and the subject to both appear more in-focus at the same time) and if the diaphragm is opened up again the depth of field will decrease (i.e., the background and foreground will share less and less of the same focal plane). History In his 1567 work La Pratica della Perspettiva Venetian nobleman Daniele Barbaro (1514–1570) described using a camera obscura with a biconvex lens as a drawing aid and points out that the picture is more vivid if the lens is covered as much as to leave a circumference in the middle. In 1762, Leonhard EulerLeonhard Euler, \\"Precautions to be used in the Construction of Telescopes. Necessitiy of blackening the Inside of Tubes. Diaphragms.\\" 1762, in Letters of Euler on different subjects in physics and philosophy. Addressed to a German princess, Vol. II, Henry Hunter, D.D. (ed.), London, 1802, says with respect to telescopes that, \\"it is necessary likewise to furnish the inside of the tube with one or more diaphragms, perforated with a small circular aperture, the better to exclude all extraneous light.\\" In 1867, Dr. Désiré van Monckhoven, in one of the earliest books on photographic optics,Désiré van Monckhoven, Photographic Optics: Including the Description of Lenses and Enlarging Apparatus, English translation, London: Robert Hardwicke, 1867 draws a distinction betweens stops and diaphragms in photography, but not in optics, saying: :\\"Let us see what takes place when the stop is removed from the lens to a proper distance. In this case the stop becomes a diaphragm. : * In optics, stop and diaphragm are synonyms. But in photographic optics they are only so by an unfortunate confusion of language. The stop reduces the lens to its central aperture; the diaphragm, on the contrary, allows all the segments of the lens to act, but only on the different radiating points placed symmetrically and concentrically in relation to the axis of the lens, or of the system of lenses (of which the axis is, besides, in every case common).\\" This distinction was maintained in Wall's 1889 Dictionary of Photography (see figure), but disappeared after Ernst Abbe's theory of stops unified these concepts. According to Rudolf Kingslake,Rudolf Kingslake, A History of the Photographic Lens, London: Academic Press, 1989 the inventor of the iris diaphragm is unknown. Others credit Joseph Nicéphore Niépce for this device, around 1820. Mr. J. H. Brown, a member of the Royal Microscopical Society, appears to have invented a popular improved iris diaphragm by 1867.J. Henle, W, Keferstein, and G. Meissner, Bericht über die Fortschritte der Anatomie und Physiologie im Jahre 1867, Liepzip: C. F. Winter'sche Verlagshandlung, 1868. Kingslake has more definite histories for some other diaphragm types, such as M. Noton's adjustable cat eye diaphragm of two sliding squares in 1856, and the Waterhouse stops of John Waterhouse in 1858. The Hamburg Observatory-Bergedorf location had a 60 cm (~23.6 inch) aperture Great Refractor by Reposold and Steinheil (Lenses). One unique feature of Hamburg Great Refractor is Iris diaphragm that allows the aperture to be adjusted from 5 to 60 cm. This telescope was activated in the early 1910s.

French was one of 20 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the Second World War. He was killed in action fighting against the Japanese during the Battle of Milne Bay in September 1942 while serving with the 2/9th Battalion. Early life French was born on 15 July 1914 in Crows Nest, north of Toowoomba in Queensland. His parents were Lucy (née Donaldson) and Albert French. His father was a hairdresser who had moved to the Crows Nest area from Tenterfield, New South Wales, while his mother had originally come from Charleville, Queensland. In his formative years, French had a reputation as a good sportsman, excelling particularly at rugby league. He was also known for his sense of fair play, with one of his childhood friends, Alf Blinco, recounting the story of how French had exonerated him when he had been falsely accused of stealing by finding the real perpetrators. At age six, French attended the Crows Nest State Primary School, continuing his schooling there until 1928 when he gained a scholarship to further his education by successfully passing a scholarship examination. After this, French attended the Toowoomba State High School and Toowoomba Technical College. In 1929, after completing his schooling, he joined his father's business, commencing an apprenticeship. Second World War After the outbreak of the Second World War, French enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 22 October 1939, the first in Crow's Nest to do so. As a Queenslander, French was posted to the 2/9th Battalion, the first infantry battalion raised in Queensland during the war. In early May 1940, after completing training at Redbank, Queensland, the 2/9th Battalion received orders to deploy overseas. Embarking upon the Mauritania, they sailed to the United Kingdom where the battalion formed part of an Australian contingent – part of the 6th Division – that were to help defend against a possible invasion following the fall of France. The invasion did not eventuate and in late 1940, the battalion – along with the rest of the 18th Brigade – were transferred to the Middle East. They reached Alexandria in late December and shortly after arrival, the battalion became part of the 7th Division. In March 1941, the 2/9th took part in their first combat action, successfully capturing the Italian fort of Giarabub. The battalion then joined the garrison at Tobruk as it was surrounded by German forces, taking part in several actions before being withdrawn in August. They briefly trained in Palestine before being sent to Syria, where they undertook garrison duties following the capitulation of Vichy French forces. French was promoted to corporal in December. In early 1942, in response to the growing threat posed by Japan's entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, the 2/9th Battalion, along with the rest of the 7th Division, was brought back to Australia. At this time they were eventually granted seven days' leave, and French returned to Australia and Crow's Nest. This leave was the final time his family saw him alive. This was followed by further training as the Australian Army reorganised for jungle warfare, before the 2/9th were committed to the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea. =Victoria Cross= John Alexander French's Grave at the Bomana War Cemetery, Port Moresby In late August 1942, the 2/9th Battalion was deployed to the Milne Bay area of New Guinea. The Japanese were advancing south along the Kokoda Track and Allied intelligence had predicted an attack around Milne Bay. In early September, the battalion took part in heavy fighting after the Japanese landed a force to capture the Allied airfields situated there. It was during this fighting that French performed the deeds that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation for French's VC award reads as follows: The fighting around Milne Bay eventually resulted in Japanese withdrawal, and represented the first full-scale defeat of the Japanese on land during the war. Although French's Victoria Cross was gazetted first, his award was actually the second for actions on Australian territory (due to Papua New Guinea being under Australian Government jurisdiction), as Bruce Kingsbury received his VC for actions near Isurava on the Kokoda Track on 29 August 1942. French is buried at the Bomana War Cemetery at Port Moresby. He was survived by his fiancée Dulcie McCahon. Two of his brothers also served during the war: Eric in the Army and Gordon, who was killed in action in August 1943 in Europe, in the Royal Australian Air Force. Legacy The library at Crows Nest is called the John French V.C. Memorial Library. The Corporal John Alexander 'Jack' French VC Estate in Gaythorne, Brisbane is named in his honour.

The citation published on 21 June 1918 stated: :For most conspicuous bravery, resource in action under adverse conditions, and utter contempt for danger. :During an attack, he, with a few other men, succeeded under intense fire, in creeping forward with a Lewis gun in order to engage an enemy machine gun which had caused severe casualties to officers and other ranks who had attempted to put it out of action. No. 1 of the Lewis gun opened fire, and was shot immediately. Without a moment's hesitation Rifleman Karanbahadur pushed the dead man off the gun, and in spite of bombs thrown at him and heavy fire from both flanks, he opened fire and knocked out the enemy machine-gun crew; then, switching his fire on to the enemy bombers and riflemen in front of him, he silenced their fire. He kept his gun in action and showed the greatest coolness in removing defects which on two occasions prevented the gun from firing. During the remainder of the day he did magnificent work, and when a withdrawal was ordered he assisted with covering fire until the enemy were close on him. He displayed throughout a very high standard of valour and devotion to duty.: The unit, date and place of VC actions were not gazetted from 1916 until 11 November 1918. These details were gazetted on 31 March 1919 when Karanbahadur Rana was listed with the '2/3rd Q.A.O. Gurkha Rif.’, the date ‘10.4.18’ and place ‘El Kefr’. The gazette incorrectly stated El Kefr was in Egypt. It is in Palestine.Action of Berukin, 9–11 April In silencing the enemy machine-gun, Karanbahadur Rana, enabled his company commander, Lieutenant Frederick Barter, who had been lying within 30 yards of the machine gun for five and a half hours to withdraw. As a company sergeant-major with The Royal Welch Fusiliers, Lieutenant Barter had been awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery at Festubert, France, on 16 May 1915.Gerald Gliddon.

Early years Manley Angell James was born in Odiham, Hampshire on 12 July 1896, the son of Dr. John Angell James and Emily Cormel James, and the second of four children.Gliddon, p. 42 The family later moved to Bristol, where Manley was educated at Bristol Grammar School in 1906 and joined the Officers' Training Corps (OTC), where he rose to the rank of sergeant. First World War Although intending to follow his father into the medical profession, having already entered a medical course at Bristol University in the autumn, the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, shortly after his eighteenth birthday, saw James, along with many others of his generation, volunteer for service with the British Army instead. As a result, on 1 December 1914, James was gazetted as an officer, with the rank of temporary second lieutenant, into the 8th (Service) Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment, a line infantry regiment of the British Army with a distinguished history. The battalion, a Kitchener's Army unit raised from civilian volunteers in September, formed part of the 57th Brigade of the 19th (Western) Division (nicknamed \\"The Butterfly Division\\" due to its divisional insignia) and, after many months of training, departed for service on the Western Front in July 1915, arriving in France on 18 July as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The battalion was to remain on the Western Front for the rest of the war. By this time James, promoted to temporary lieutenant on 28 June 1915, was in command of the battalion's lewis gun detachment. With most of the rest of 1915 spent learning about the basics of trench warfare, July 1916 saw the battalion – then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Adrian Carton de Wiart – engaged in the Battle of the Somme, specifically in the capture of La Boisselle.Gliddon, p. 43 James was wounded in this action and evacuated to England for treatment. He was mentioned in despatches for his handling of the battalion's Lewis guns, and returned to France in December as a member of the 57th Brigade HQ staff, which was not to his liking. He rejoined his battalion soon afterwards and was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 22 February 1917, he was given command of 'A' Company and was again wounded, this time by shrapnel, and in April he was again mentioned in despatches. Returning again to the front, he fought in the Battle of Messines in June 1917, where he was slightly wounded and awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his part in capturing a position called Druid's Farm. James's company was singled out for praise by the 19th Division's General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Tom Bridges, who issued a special order, awarding a badge of Honour to 'A' Company, enabling the badge to be worn on the right sleeve of every member of James's company. The citation for his MC reads: The German Army launched its Spring Offensive in March 1918 with the aim of cutting off the BEF, deployed mainly in northern Belgium, from the French Army in the south. The German intention was to force a victory on the Western Front before the United States (which had entered the war in April 1917) were able to deploy significant numbers of troops on the Western Front, thereby making victory for Germany all but impossible against the overwhelming resources of the United States. =Victoria Cross action= On 21 March 1918, near Velu Wood, France, James led his company forward, capturing 27 prisoners and two machine-guns. Although wounded, he refused to leave his company and repulsed three enemy assaults over the next day. Two days later, the enemy having broken through, he made a determined stand. His company inflicted heavy losses and gained valuable time for the withdrawal of the guns. After holding out to the last to enable the brigade to be extricated, he led his company forward in a local counter-attack, being again wounded in the process. He was last seen working a machine-gun single-handed, was wounded a third time and eventually taken prisoner. James's company sustained seventy-five percent casualties in the offensive and many believed James himself to have been killed in action. In May he managed to send a postcard to his father informing him he had been taken prisoner and he was released soon after the Armistice with Germany in November and arrived in England on 25 December 1918. Between the wars James was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 February 1919. He was later discharged from the army, and played for Clifton Rugby Football Club for a few years before receiving a permanent Regular Army commission as a lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Regiment on 10 December 1920 (with seniority backdated to 1 July 1917). James was one of only two Glosters' officers who had received a wartime commission to be granted a commission in the Regular Army.Gliddon, p. 44 On 27 May 1925 James was promoted to captain and later served as adjutant of the 1st Battalion, Glosters from 12 December 1925 until 14 December 1928. In 1926 he became engaged to Miss Noreen Cooper, marrying her two years later, and had their only child, a son, Peter, born in December 1930. He served with the battalion in Egypt between 1928–1930 before returning to the regimental depot in Bristol and, from 1930−1931 he attended the Staff College, Camberley, where his many fellow students included Miles Dempsey, James Steele, George Symes, George Hopkinson, William Gott, John Nichols and Maurice Chilton, all of whom were to achieve general officer rank in the war. James returned to the 1st Battalion, Glosters as a company commander in 1933 and from November 1934 to December 1936 he was a General Staff Officer (GSO) with Western Command. Promoted to major on 25 December 1936, he succeeded John Nichols, his fellow student at Camberley, as a brigade major with the 13th Infantry Brigade, The brigade was then commanded by Brigadier John Priestman until succeeded in September 1938 by Brigadier Reade Godwin-Austen. The brigade was serving in Palestine during the Arab revolt, before returning to England where it became part of the 5th Infantry Division, then serving under Northern Command. James held this post until January 1939. Promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1938, on 10 January 1939 he transferred from the Gloucestershire Regiment to the Royal Sussex Regiment and receiving promotion in that regiment to lieutenant colonel, and, on the same date, became Commanding Officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex. The battalion was then serving in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on internal security duties. Second World War At the start of the Second World War in September 1939 his battalion was sent to England where it became part of the 133rd Infantry Brigade of the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation, then preparing for overseas service in France. On 21 March 1940 he relinquished command of the battalion and, promoted to acting colonel the following day, became a GSO1 of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division, another TA formation, then commanded by Major General John Priestman, who had commanded the 13th Brigade years before when James had been brigade major. On 19 July 1940, shortly after the Dunkirk evacuation, James was promoted to the acting rank of brigadier, and served on the staff of the newly created VIII Corps. The corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Harold Franklyn, who James knew as the commander of the 5th Division in the late 1930s. He was not there long, however, as in February 1941 he succeeded Brigadier Frederick Browning as CO of the TA 128th Infantry Brigade, then serving in Kent as part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, and commanded by Major General Charles Allfrey, and comprising three TA battalions of the Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment). On 12 December 1941 James's rank of colonel was made permanent (with seniority backdated to 1 July 1941). In August 1942 the 43rd Division, now commanded by Major General Ivor Thomas, was reorganised as a 'mixed' division and the 128th Brigade transferred to Major General Harold Freeman-Attwood's 46th Infantry Division. After months spent training in desert warfare, James led the brigade overseas to North Africa in mid-January 1943, where it fought throughout the Tunisian Campaign until its end in mid-May with distinction, earning James a Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The campaign came to an end in mid-May 1943, with the surrender of thousands of Axis soldiers. The brigade then, after initially being held in reserve for the Allied invasion of Sicily, settled down for training before taking part in the Allied invasion of Italy in September where his brigade, along with the rest of the division, now commanded by Major-General John Hawkesworth, sustained very heavy casualties and James himself was wounded on 20 September and evacuated to Egypt. In 1944, after recovering from his injuries, he was assigned to the General Staff of Middle East Command, and was transferred to the General Staff for Training Home Forces. Finally, in 1945, he became the CO for the 140th Infantry Brigade, a training formation. Post-war Between 1948 and 1951 he was the Director of Ground Defence for the Air Ministry. He was promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier on 1 July 1948 and on 1 March 1951 he retired from the military. He died in Westbury-on-Trym at the age of 79 on 23 September 1975, he was cremated at Canford Cemetery.Gliddon, p. 45 His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

Gordon was one of 20 Australians to receive the award for their actions during World War II, receiving it for deeds he performed while fighting against the Vichy French during the Syria-Lebanon campaign. He later served against the Japanese in the New Guinea campaign and after the war became a regular Army soldier, serving until 1968. He died in 1986, at the age of 77. Early life Gordon was born in Rockingham, Western Australia, one of eight children born to William Beattie Gordon, a farmer who served as a state parliamentarian between 1901 and 1911, and his wife Harriet Ann Scott. Growing up on farming properties near Moora and in Gingin, Western Australia, after completing his schooling, Gordon undertook various laboring jobs including droving, farming and working on the goldfields.Horner 2007, pp. 448–449. Military career On 26 April 1940, during the early stages of the Second World War, Gordon volunteered for overseas service, lying about his age to join the Australian Imperial Force; falsely giving his middle name as Heather. Shortly afterwards, he married Myrtle Troy at St Edmund’s Church of England, Wembley Park, Perth, on 14 June 1940. After a period of training, Gordon was sent to the Middle East in September 1940. He was later assigned to the 2/31st Battalion, an infantry unit formed in Queensland and Victoria, which was part of the 7th Australian Division, in February 1941. In June–July 1941, the unit was engaged in the Syria-Lebanon campaign against the Vichy French. During the Battle of Jezzine, on 10 July 1941, Gordon's company was \\"...held up by intense machine-gun and grenade fire from Vichy French forces, but on his own initiative, he crept forward alone and succeeded in getting close to the machine-gun post. He then charged it and killed the four machine-gunners with his bayonet. His action demoralised the enemy in this sector and the company advanced and took the position.\\" He was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross for this action. On 12 July 1942, a plaque in his honour was unveiled in front of the Gingin Post Office; it was later moved to the town's war memorial. Later that year a portrait of Jim Gordon painted in 1941 by artist William Dargie won the 1942 Archibald Prize, Australia's most famous portrait prize. Gordon returned to Australia in March 1942 with the rank of corporal. Due to malaria he did not rejoin the 2/31st Battalion in Papua until November 1942. In July 1943, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant. After seeing further action during the capture of Lae and the subsequent advance through the Markham and Ramu Valleys in New Guinea, he returned to Australia in January 1944. He was hospitalised due to malaria again, and was later reassigned to administrative duties. He remained in the Army until 17 February 1947. After discharge, Gordon briefly worked for the state electricity commission, before rejoining the army as a regular soldier on 2 December 1947, achieving the rank of Warrant Officer Class II in 1950. He continued service until 1 August 1968 when he retired; after this, he was employed at Campbell Barracks, Swanbourne, as a groundsman until 1975. Later life He died on 19 July 1986 at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood. After being cremated, he received full military honours. The Jim Gordon Ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital has been named in his honour. His wife, Myrtle, and one son survived him. Notes References  External links *Private J.H.

Kibby emigrated to South Australia with his parents in early 1914 and worked as an interior decorator and served in the part-time Militia prior to World WarII. In 1940, he enlisted in the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force and joined the 2/48th Infantry Battalion. His unit was sent to the Middle East, but soon after arriving, Kibby broke his leg and spent the next year recovering and undergoing further training while his battalion took part in the North African campaign. He rejoined his unit when it was serving on garrison duties in northern Syria after its involvement in the Siege of Tobruk, but in June 1942 it was sent to Egypt and recommitted to the North Africa campaign. Kibby was with the battalion during the First Battle of El Alamein in July. In October, the 2/48th Battalion was committed to the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which Kibby undertook a series of courageous actions across the period from 23 to 31 October. In the first episode, he went forward alone and silenced an enemy machine gun post. In the second, he provided inspirational leadership to his platoon and mended its telephone line under heavy fire. On the final occasion, he pressed forward under withering fire and helped his company capture its objective. This final action ultimately cost him his life. He was then posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. A memorial trust used donated monies to purchase a house for his widow and two daughters. His medal set is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in the Hall of Valour. Early life William Henry Kibby was born at Winlaton, County Durham, UK, on 15 April 1903. The second of three children, Kibby was born to John Robert Kibby, a draper's assistant, and Mary Isabella Kibby Birnie. He had two sisters. In early 1914, the Kibby family emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia. Bill attended Mitcham Public School and then held various jobs before securing a position at the Perfection Fibrous Plaster Works in Edwardstown. There, he worked as an interior decorator, designing and fixing plaster decorations. He married Mabel Sarah Bidmead Morgan in 1926; they lived at Helmsdale (now Glenelg East) and had two daughters. Kibby stood only tall, but was a strong man and enjoyed outdoor activities. He joined the scouting movement, as an assistant scoutmaster of the 2nd Glenelg Sea Scouts where he crewed their lifeboat. He enjoyed family walks and picnics and was a keen golfer, playing on various public courses. He was also a talented artist, painting and drawing in addition to his plaster design work, and even briefly attended art classes at the School of Mines and Industries. He was described as a quiet and sincere man who loved gardening. In 1936, he joined the part-time Militia and was posted to the 48th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery. Along with his Militia service, he enjoyed participating in military tattoos. World War II On 29 June 1940, Kibby enlisted in the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force, which had been raised for overseas service in World WarII. He was posted to the 2/48th Infantry Battalion, part of the 26th Brigade. This brigade was initially assigned to the 7th Division. On 14 September, when the battalion was training in South Australia, Kibby was promoted to acting corporal, and this was followed by promotion to acting sergeant a month later. The 2/48th embarked on the troopship HMT Stratheden on 17 November and sailed for the Middle East, where it disembarked in Palestine on 17 December. On New Year's Eve, Kibby fell into a slit trench and broke his leg. He then spent months convalescing. During his recovery, he produced at least forty watercolours and pencil drawings, which, according to his biographer, Bill Gammage, displayed \\"a fondness for Palestine's countryside and a feeling for its people\\". While in Palestine, Kibby struck up a friendship with the painter Esmond George, and occasionally accompanied him on sketching trips. After recovering, Kibby joined the brigade training battalion in August 1941 and also attended the infantry school to complete a weapons course. He rejoined the 2/48th in February 1942, the 26th Brigade having been transferred to the 9th Division a year earlier. At the time, the battalion was undertaking garrison duties in northern Syria, after participating in the Siege of Tobruk. During early 1942, the Axis forces had advanced steadily through northwest Egypt. It was decided that the British Eighth Army should make a stand just over west of Alexandria, at the railway siding of El Alamein, where the coastal plain narrowed between the Mediterranean Sea and the inhospitable Qattara Depression. On 26 June 1942, the 9th Division was ordered to begin moving from northern Syria to El Alamein. On 1July, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's forces made a major attack, hoping to dislodge the Allies from the area, take Alexandria, and open the way to Cairo and the Suez Canal. This attack resulted in the First Battle of El Alamein. The Eighth Army had regrouped sufficiently to repel the Axis forces and launch counter-attacks. On 6July, the lead elements of the 9th Division arrived at Tel el Shammama from the front, from where they would be committed to the fighting in the northern sector. Jubilee 150 Walkway plaque commemorating highly decorated World WarII soldiers from South Australia Before dawn on 10 July, as Rommel focused his efforts on the southern flank of the battlefield, the 9th Division attacked the north flank of the enemy positions and captured the strategic high ground around Tel el Eisa. In the days following, Rommel redirected his forces against them, in a series of intense counter-attacks, but was unable to dislodge the Australians. On 22 July, the 24th and 26th Brigades attacked German positions on the ridges south of Tel el Eisa, suffering heavy casualties but taking positions on Makh Khad Ridge and Tel el Eisa itself. At the Second Battle of El Alamein, from 23 to 31 October 1942, Kibby distinguished himself through his skill in leading his platoon, after its commander had been killed, during the first attack at Miteiriya Ridge. On 23 October, he charged a machine gun position, firing at it with his Thompson submachine gun; Kibby killed three enemy soldiers, captured twelve others and took the position. His company commander intended to recommend him for the Distinguished Conduct Medal after this action, but was killed. During the following days, Kibby moved among his men directing fire and cheering them on. He mended his platoon's telephone line several times under intense fire. During 30–31 October, the platoon came under heavy machine gun and mortar fire. Most of the members of the platoon were killed or wounded, and by the time the battle was over the total fighting strength of the battalion was down to 213 men from an establishment strength of 910. At one point before midnight on 31 October, in order to achieve his company's objective, Kibby moved forward alone, to within a few metres of the enemy, throwing grenades. Just as his success in this endeavour appeared decisive, he was killed. By the morning, the 2/48th consisted of fewer than 50 unwounded men. The posts captured by the 2/48th that night were lost to the enemy, who buried Kibby with other casualties in a common grave. Later, when the area was retaken by Australian troops, the men of his unit searched for ten days, found the grave and reburied the men individually. Kibby was subsequently recommended for the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to an Australian armed forces member at the time. The citation was partly based on a note found in the pocket of his dead company commander. The award was listed in the London Gazette on 26 January 1943, and the citation read: alt=a bronze Cross pattée suspended from a crimson ribbon George was invalided back to Adelaide early in 1943 and was able to pass on to Mabel Kibby some of her husband's works. The Governor- General of Australia, Baron Gowrie, himself a recipient of the VC, presented Kibby's award to Mabel Kibby on 27 November 1943. Grave of Bill Kibby at the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery, El Alamein, Egypt Postscript In January 1944, Kibby's remains were re-interred in the El Alamein War Cemetery maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In the same year, a memorial trust was established and raised A₤1,001, which was used to purchase a house on Third Avenue, Helmsdale, for Mabel and their daughters. Along with the Victoria Cross, Kibby was also entitled to the 1939–1945 Star, Africa Star with 8th Army clasp, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945. Later, Mabel donated his medal set to the Australian War Memorial; it is on display in the Hall of Valour. In 1947, Kibby's father John met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, who had commanded the Allied forces during the Second Battle of El Alamein, when he visited Adelaide. In 1956, the soldiers' mess at Woodside Barracks in the Adelaide Hills was named for Kibby. In 1996, a rest area on the Federal Highway near Yarra, New South Wales was named after him.

Details He was about 29 years old, and a private in the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot (later The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) ), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 6 January 1858 at the capture of the town of Rowa, India for which he was awarded the VC: Burial McQuirt's memorial stone was erected in 1995 in an Anglican graveyard in Donaghcloney, where McQuirt was born. But his remains are not in this graveyard. McQuirt died in Erney Street off the Shankill Road, Belfast, 5 October 1888, and no one knew where he was buried. In 1993, an employee of Belfast City Council, Robert Burns, found McQuirt's registration and burial site in a Catholic plot of the Belfast City Cemetery. As there was no gravestone Burns contacted the Sherwood Foresters Museum in England and they proposed to pay for a stone. When Burns asked for permission to erect the stone in the graveyard the Catholic Church refused permission, claiming the plot was a poor plot with many other remains in the grave. Bernard lived in obscurity at 72 Urney Street. Robert then approached the City Council for permission to erect the memorial stone on a wall in Urney Street (off Shankill Road) were Bernard McQuirt VC died in 1888. This was also rejected. Then Robert approached locals from Donaghcloney to erect the memorial stone in the local village square beside the World War I and World War II war memorial. This was also rejected. Finally a local Church of Ireland Minister offered Burns access to the local Donaghcloney Church graveyard to erect the memorial stone. In 2000 a British Army colour party from a regiment based in Northern Ireland finally dedicated the stone in memory of Bernard McQuirt VC.

Early life Charles FitzClarence was born in County Kildare, the son of Captain George FitzClarence (15 April 1836 – 24 March 1894) and Maria Henrietta Scott (1841 – 27 July 1912). He had a twin brother named Edward. His paternal grandfather was The 1st Earl of Munster, an illegitimate son of William, Duke of Clarence (later King William IV of the United Kingdom). He joined the Royal Fusiliers in 1886 but his early career was blighted by several bouts of illness and he spent much of his time in administrative and staff roles. In 1899 he volunteered to serve as a Special Service Officer at Mafeking, South Africa and was given the duty of training a squadron of the Protectorate Regiment. The VC action FitzClarence was 34 years old, and a captain in The Royal Fusiliers, British Army, during the Second Boer War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross: His ferocity in battle earned him the enduring nickname 'The Demon'. He served in South Africa until February 1901, at which point he transferred to the newly formed Irish Guards. He passed Staff College in 1904 and succeeded to the command of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards in July 1909. He had a reputation as a forward thinking soldier and took an innovative, albeit demanding, approach to training. It was noted he was \\"both loved and feared by his battalion\\". At the outbreak of the First World War he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and was given command of the newly formed 29th Brigade.  The Great War  On 27 September 1914 he replaced Brigadier-General Ivor Maxse as commander of 1st Guards' Brigade with the British Expeditionary Force. He held this command until he was killed in action on 12 November 1914. On 4 October 1914, whilst 1st Guards' Brigade was holding trenches opposite the German line at the River Aisne, he ordered the Coldstream Guards to carry out a night time raid against a German position known as 'Fish Hook Trench'. This was the first British trench raid of the First World War. The raid was led by Second Lieutenant Merton Beckwith-Smith and was a striking local success. In October, FitzClarence had played a significant part in the First Battle of Ypres. Captain Valentine Williams, MC, writing in Blackwood's Magazine, described the action at Gheluvelt thus: \\"The Coldstream and Scots Guards' battalions of FitzClarence's brigade, in trenches north of Gheluvelt, suffered terribly in a German attack, delivered in a dense mist on the morning of the 27th along the Menin road. The odds against the British were crushing, for on that day some 24,000 Germans were arrayed against about 5,000 exhausted British troops. In two days the Scots Guards lost 10 officers and 370 men killed and wounded. But the result of the day's fighting was that the British line stood firm and unbroken, while the Germans had sustained enormous losses\\". Sir John French, in his Despatch published on 30 November 1914, described the fighting at this time as: \\"Perhaps the most important and decisive attack (except that of the Prussian Guard on the 10th November) made against the 1st Corps during the whole of its arduous experiences in the neighbourhood of Ypres.\\" Blackwood's Magazine for August 1917 carries an article describing FitzClarence's part. It was he who gave the order for the vital counter-attack of 31 October 1914. He \\"rallied the troops and directed the successful onslaught\\". Lt Col. E. B. Hankey, involved in the attack, said of FitzClarence: \\" ... by shoving us in at the time and place he did, the General saved the day.\\" On the morning of 11 November the Prussian Guard attacked British troops along the Menin Road. Thirteen battalions of them came on, but only in three places did the Prussian Guard break through. On the following morning FitzClarence counter-attacked. The General himself decided to show his old regiment the way, and paid for the decision with his life. FitzClarence fell dead, and neither FitzClarence himself, nor Sir John French knew how well he had served his country at Gheluvelt. In his Despatch of 20 November 1914, Sir John French said: \\"Another officer whose name was particularly mentioned to me was Brigadier-General FitzClarence, VC, commanding the 1st Guards' Brigade. He was unfortunately killed in the night attack of the 11th November. His loss will be severely felt\\". His most recent biographer, Spencer Jones, describes FitzClarence as exemplifying \\"...the best aspects of the post-Boer War [British] officer class\\" due to his \\"courage, professionalism, natural leadership, and willingness to act upon his own initiative.\\" He was killed in action, aged 49, at Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke, Belgium, on 12 November 1914 whilst commanding the 1st (Guards) Brigade. He is the highest-ranking officer inscribed on the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres, commemorating those with no known grave.

He departed for France on 6 May 1915 where his battalion was attached to the 51st Highland Division, stationed near Arras. During the precursor bombardment to the Battle of Arras, on 5 April 1917 Gosling was a battery sergeant in charge of several heavy trench mortars. A bomb was fired from a Stokes Mortar of Sergeant Gosling's battery. \\"Owing to a faulty cartridge the bomb, after discharge, fell 10 yards from the mortar. Sergeant Gosling sprang out, lifted the nose of the bomb which had sunk into the ground, unscrewed the fuse and threw it on the ground, where it immediately exploded.
